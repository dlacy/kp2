an ancient and conſiderable town of France. It is the capital of Saintonge, and before the revolution was a biſhop’s ſee. It contained likewiſe ſeveral convents, a Jeſuits college, and an abbey remarkable for its ſteeple, built with ſmall ſtones, which admits the light. It is ſeated on an eminence, 37 miles ſoutheaſt of Rochelle, and 262 ſouth ſouth-weſt of Paris. W. Long. O. 34. N. Lat. 45. 45. The caſtle is ſeated on a rock, and is reckoned impregnable.</p><p>This city was a Roman colony; and thoſe conquerors of the earth, who poliſhed the nations they ſubdued, have left behind them the traces of their magnificence. In a hollow valley between two mountains, and almoſt adjoining to one of the ſuburbs, are the ruins of the amphitheatre. Though now in the laſt ſtage of decay, its appearance is auguſt and venerable. In ſome parts, ſcarce any of the arches are to be ſeen; but the eaſt end is ſtill in a great degree of preſervation. From its ſituation in a valley, and from the ruins of an aqueduct which conveyed water to the town from near three leagues diſtance, it has been ſuppoſed that Naumachae were repreſented in it; but this amounts only to conjecture. A triumphal arch, on which is an inſcription in Roman letters, merits likewiſe attention. It was erected to Germanicus, on the news of his death, ſo univerſally lamented throughout the empire. The river Charente ſurrounds this city, as the Severne does that of Shrewſhury, deſcribing the form of a horſe-ſhoe.</p><p>Except the remains of Roman grandeur yet viſible at Saintes, the place contains very Iittle to detain or amuſe a traveller. It is built with great irregularity; the ſtreets are narrow and winding, the houſes mean, and almoſt all of them are ſome centuries old. The cathedral has been repeatedly defaced and deſtroyed by Normans and Huguenots, who made war alike on every monument of art or piety. One tower only eſcaped their rage, which is ſaid to have been built as early as the year 800 by Charlemagne. It is of an enormous magnitude, both as to height and circumference. Theſe circumſtances have probably conduced more to its preſervation during the fury of war, than any veneration for the memory of its founder, or for the ſanctity of its inſtitution.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
