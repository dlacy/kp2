a town of Dorſetſhire in England, in W. Long. 3. 20, N. Lat, 51. 0. It ſtands on a high hill, and is built in the form of a bow. It enjoys a ſerene wholeſome air, and has a fine proſpect. It is a good thoroughfare, is governed by a mayor, and lends two members to parliament. This town is ſuppoſed to have been built in the 8th century, and to have been enlarged by king Alfred, and had 12 churches, beſides a Benedictine monaſtery, in the time of the Saxons, but has now only three. St Edward the martyr was</p><p>buried here. It had three mints before the conqueſt, and, in the reign of Henry VIII. was the ſee of a ſuffragan biſhop. It was incorporated by queen Elizabeth and Charles II and is governed by a mayor, recorder, twelve aldermen, bailiffs, and a common-council. It contains about 320 houfes, many of which are of free-ſtone. Water is ſo scarce, that it uſed to be ſupplied from Motcomb ; but it was obtained more commodiouſly in 1718, by means of engines, which raiſed the water above 300 feet perpendicular, and conveyed it to a large ciſtern in the middle of the town, from the diſtance of two miles. Yet even this is laid aſide, and they have dug ſeveral pits, in which they preſerve the rain-water; and the poor get their living to this day by fetching it in pails or on horſes. It gives the title of earl to the noble family of Cooper.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">ShaFtesburY</hi> (earl of). See <hi rend="smallcaps">Cooper.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
