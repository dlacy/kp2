<p><span class="font2">the principles and organization of scientific study as applied beyond the Rhine, and who were ready to devote themselves&nbsp;to their cherished plan of remodelling higher education in&nbsp;France. He was appointed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“ répétiteur ’’ </span><span class="font2">at the École&nbsp;des Hautes Études on its foundation in 1868. His researches&nbsp;were at that time directed towards the Byzantine period of&nbsp;the middle ages, and to this period were devoted the two&nbsp;theses which he composed for his doctorate in letters, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">De&nbsp;byzantino hippodromo et circensibus factionibus</span><span class="font2"> (revised in French&nbsp;for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Revue des Deux Mondes,</span><span class="font2"> under the title of “ Le monde&nbsp;byzantin; le sport et l’hippodrome,’’ 1871), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L’Empire grec&nbsp;au </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">X<sup>e</sup> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">siècle, Constantin Porphyrogénète</span><span class="font2"> (1870). This latter&nbsp;work is still accepted as a good authority, and caused Rambaud&nbsp;to be hailed as a master on the Byzantine period; but with&nbsp;the exception of one article on Digenis Akritas, in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Revue&nbsp;des Deux Mondes</span><span class="font2"> (1875), and one other on Michael Psellos,&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Revue historique</span><span class="font2"> (vol. iii., 1876), Rambaud’s researches&nbsp;were diverted towards other parts of the East. The Franco-German War inspired him with the idea for some courses of&nbsp;lectures which developed into books: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La domination française&nbsp;en Allemagne; les Français sur le Rhin, 1792-1804</span><span class="font2"> (1873)&nbsp;and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L'Allemagne sous Napoléon I. 1804-1811</span><span class="font2"> (1874). He&nbsp;watched attentively the rôle played by Russia, and soon&nbsp;observed how much to the interest of France, a good </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">entente&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">with this power would be. He accordingly threw himself&nbsp;into the study of Russian history, staying in Russia in order&nbsp;to learn its language, institutions and customs. On his return,&nbsp;he published </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Russie épique,</span><span class="font2"> a study of the heroic songs&nbsp;(1876), a short but excellent </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la Russie depuis les&nbsp;origines jusqu’à l’année 1877</span><span class="font2"> (1878; 5th ed., 1900), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Français&nbsp;et Russes, Moscou et Sévastopol 1812-1854</span><span class="font2"> (1876; 2nd ed.,&nbsp;1881), and finally the two important volumes on Russian&nbsp;diplomatic history in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Recueil des Instructions données aux&nbsp;ambassadeurs</span><span class="font2"> (vols. vii. and ix., 1890 and 1891). He was not&nbsp;improbably moved by considerations of foreign policy to&nbsp;publish his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Russes et Prussiens, guerre de Sept Ans</span><span class="font2"> (1895), a&nbsp;popular work, though based on solid research. After teaching&nbsp;history in the Faculties of Arts at Caen (1871) and Nancy&nbsp;(1873), he was called to the Sorbonne (1883), where he was&nbsp;the first to occupy the chair of contemporary history. By&nbsp;this time he had already entered into politics; he had been&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chef du cabinet</span><span class="font2"> of Jules Ferry (1879-1881), though this did not&nbsp;distract him from his literary work. It was under these&nbsp;conditions that he composed his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la civilisation&nbsp;française</span><span class="font2"> (2 vols., 1885, 1887; 9th ed., 1901) and his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire&nbsp;de la civilisation contemporaine en France</span><span class="font2"> (1888; new ed.&nbsp;entirely revised, 1906), and undertook the general editorship&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire générale du IV<sup>e</sup> siècle jusqu’à nos jours.</span><span class="font2"> The&nbsp;plan of this great work had been drawn up with the aid of Ernest&nbsp;Lavisse, but the entire supervision of its execution was carried&nbsp;out by Rambaud. He contributed to it himself some interesting&nbsp;chapters on the history of the East, of which he had a thorough&nbsp;knowledge. In 1885 Rambaud published, in collaboration&nbsp;with J. B. Bailie, a French translation of J. R. Seeley’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Expansion of England,</span><span class="font2"> and in the preface he laid great emphasis&nbsp;on the enormous increase of power brought to England by&nbsp;the possession of her colonies, seeing in this a lesson for France.&nbsp;He was anxious to see the rise of a “Greater France,’’ on the&nbsp;model of “ Greater Britain,’’ and it was with this idea that he&nbsp;undertook to present to the public a series of essays, written&nbsp;by famous explorers or political men, under the title of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La&nbsp;France coloniale, histoire, géographie, commerce</span><span class="font2"> (1886; 6th ed.,&nbsp;1893). Having become senator for the department of Doubs&nbsp;(1895-1902), Rambaud held the position of minister of Public&nbsp;Instruction from 1896 to 1898, and in that capacity endeavoured&nbsp;to carry on the educational work of Jules Ferry, to whose&nbsp;memory he always remained faithful. He dedicated to his&nbsp;former chief a book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Jules Ferry,</span><span class="font2"> 1903), which is a valuable&nbsp;testimony to the efforts made by France to organize public&nbsp;education and found a colonial empire; but this fidelity also&nbsp;won him some enemies, who succeeded for some time in preventing him from becoming a member of the Institute. He&nbsp;was finally elected a member of the Académie des Sciences&nbsp;morales et politiques on the nth of December 1897, in place&nbsp;of the duc d’Aumale, of whose life he wrote an account (vol. xxii.,&nbsp;2nd series, of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires</span><span class="font2"> of this academy). His many&nbsp;interests ended by wearing out even his robust constitution,&nbsp;and he died at Paris on the 10th of November 1905.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAMBERT, EUGÈNE (1830-1886), Swiss author, was born at Sâles near Swiss Clarens on the 6th of April 1830, the eldest&nbsp;son of a Vaudois schoolmaster, from whom he received his&nbsp;education. When in 1845 his father lost his post, owing to&nbsp;the religious disputes, Rambert became a teacher in Paris,&nbsp;and later a tutor in England and at Geneva. When the affairs&nbsp;of the family improved, Rambert was able to pursue his studies&nbsp;for the ministry, but he was more attracted by literature, and&nbsp;in 1845 became professor of French literature at the academy&nbsp;of Lausanne, and in 1860 at the Federal polytechnic school at&nbsp;Zürich, where he remained till 1881, when he again became&nbsp;professor at Lausanne. His principal work, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Les Alpes suisses&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(5 vols., 1866-1875; republished with large additions, according&nbsp;to his own scheme, in 6 vols., 1887—1889), is a mine of miscellaneous&nbsp;information on the subject. He also published several volumes&nbsp;of poetry, as well as a volume entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Écrivains nationaux&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1874, republished 1889), and biographies of the pietist Vinet&nbsp;(1875), of the poet Juste Olivier (1879) and of the artist Alexandre&nbsp;Calame (1883). He died on the 21st of November 1886.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RAMBOUILLET, CATHERINE DE VIVONNE, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marquise de (1588-1665), a lady famous in the literary history of France,&nbsp;was born in 1588. She was the daughter and heiress of Jean de&nbsp;Vivonne, marquis of Pisani, and her mother Giulia was of the&nbsp;noble Roman family of Savelli. She was married at twelve&nbsp;years old to Charles d’Angennes, vidame of Le Mans, and afterwards marquis of Rambouillet. The young marquise found the&nbsp;coarseness and intrigue that then reigned in the French court&nbsp;little to her taste, and after the birth of her eldest daughter,&nbsp;Juh*e d’Angennes, in 1607, she began to gather round her the&nbsp;circle afterwards so famous. She established herself at the&nbsp;Hotel Pisani, called later the Hôtel de Rambouillet, the site of&nbsp;which is close to the Grands Magasins du Louvre. Aime de&nbsp;Rambouillet took great trouble to arrange her house for purposes&nbsp;of reception, and devised suites of small rooms where visitors&nbsp;could move easily, and could find more privacy than in the large&nbsp;reception rooms of the ordinary house. The hôtel was rebuilt&nbsp;on these lines in 1618. It maintained its importance as a social&nbsp;and literary centre until 1650. Almost all the more remarkable&nbsp;personages in French society and French literature frequented&nbsp;it, especially during the second quarter of the century, when it&nbsp;was at the height of its reputation. There is abundant testimony to Mme de Rambouillet’s beauty, though no portrait of&nbsp;her is known to exist. Her success as a hostess was due to many&nbsp;causes. Her natural abilities had been carefully trained, but&nbsp;were not extraordinary. Many people were, however, like&nbsp;herself, disgusted with the intrigues at court, and found the&nbsp;comparative austerity of the Hôtel de Rambouillet a welcome&nbsp;change. The marquise had genuine kindness and a lack of&nbsp;prejudice that enabled her to entertain on the same footing&nbsp;princes and princesses of the blood royal, and men of letters,&nbsp;while among her intimate friends was the beautiful Angélique&nbsp;Paulet. The respect paid to ability in her salon effected a great&nbsp;advancement in the position of French men of letters. Moreover, the almost uniform excellence of the memoirs and letters&nbsp;of 17th-century Frenchmen and Frenchwomen may be traced&nbsp;largely to the development of conversation as a fine art at the&nbsp;Hôtel Rambouillet, and the consequent establishment of a&nbsp;standard of clear and adequate expression. Mme de Rambouillet&nbsp;was known as the “ incomparable Arthénice,” the name being&nbsp;an anagram for Catherine, devised by Malherbe and Racan.</span></p>
