If, on the other hand, you leave them too long in the oven, you burn them : many inſtances of theſe two cafes are frequently to be met with. It is a good ſign when you ſee ſome of the butterflies ſpring out from the cocoons which have been baked, becauſe you may be certain they are not burnt. For if you would kill them all to the laſt worm, you would burn many cocopns which might be more expoſed to the heat than that particular worm.</p><p>The next operation is the winding of the ſilk. Before you begin to wind, you muſt prepare your cocoons as follows :</p><p>1.	In ſtripping them of that waſte ſilk that ſurrounds them, and which ſerved to faſten them to the twigs. This burr is proper to fluff quilts, or other ſuch uſes ; you may likewiſe ſpin it to make ſtockings, but they will be coarſe and ordinary.</p><p>2.	You muſt sort your cocoons, ſeparating them into different claſſes in order to wind them apart. Theſe claſſes are, the good white cocoons ; the good cocoons of all the other colours ; the dupions ; the cocalons, among which are included the weak cocoons ; the good choquette ; and, laſtly, the bad choquette. In sorting the cocoons, you will always find ſome perforated cocoons amongſt them, whoſe worm is already born ; thoſe you muſt ſet apart for fleuret. You will likewiſe find ſome fouillons, but very few ; for which reason you may put them among the bad choquette, and they run up into waſte.</p><p>The good cocoons, as well white as yellow, are the eaſieſt to wind ; thoſe which require the greateſt care and pains are the cocalons ; you muſt wind them in cooler water than the others, and if you take care to give them to a good windſter, you will have as good ſilk from them as the rest. You muſt likewiſe have careful windſters for the dupions and choquettes. Theſe two ſpecies require hotter water than the common cocoons.</p><p>The good cocoons are to be wound in the following manner : Firſt, chooſe an open convenient place for your filature, the longer the better, if you intend to have many furnaces and coppers. The building ſhould be high and open on one side, and walled on the other, as well to ſcreen you from the cold winds and receive the ſun, as to give a free paſſage to the ſteam or your basons or coppers.</p><p>Theſe coppers or basons are to be diſpoſed (when the building will admit of it) in a row on each ſide oſ the filature, as being the moſt convenient method of placing them, for by that means in walking up and down you ſee what every one is about. And theſe basons ſhould be two and two together, with a chimney between every couple.</p><p>Having prepared your reels (which are turned by hands, and require a quick eye), and your fire being a light one under every bason, your windſter muſt stay till the water is as hot as it can be without boiling. When every thing is ready, you throw into your basons two or three handfuls of cocoons, which you gently bruſh over with a wiſk about six inches long, cut ſtumpy like a broom worn out : by theſe means the threads of the cocoons ſtick to the wisk. You muſt</p><p>diſengage theſe threads from the wiſk, and purge them by drawing theſe ends with your fingers till they come off entirely clean. This operation is called <hi rend="italic">la Battue.</hi></p><p>When the threads are quite clear, you muſt paſs four of them (if you will wind fine ſilk) through each of the holes in a thin iron bar that is placed horizontally at the edge oſ your bason ; afterwards you twiſt the two ends (which conſiſt of four cocoons each) twenty or twenty-five times, that the four ends in each thread may the better join together in croſſing each other, and that your ſilk may be plump, which otherwiſe would be flat.</p><p>Your windſter muſt always have a bowl of cold water by her, to dip her fingers in, and to ſprinkle very often the ſaid bar, that the heat may not burn the thread.</p><p>Your threads, when thus twiſted, go upon two iron hooks called rampins, which are placed higher, and from thence they go upon the reel. At one end of the axis of the reel is a cog-wheel, which catching in the teeth of the poſt-rampin, moves it from the right to the left, and conſequently the thread that is upon it ; ſo that your ſilk is wound on the reel croſsways, and your threads form two hanks of about four fingers broad.</p><p>As often as the cocoons you wind are done, or break or diminiſh only, you muſt join freſh ones to keep up the number requiſite, or the proportion ; becauſe, as the cocoons wind off, the thread being finer, you muſt join two cocoons half wound to replace a new one : Thus you may wind three new ones and two half wound, and your ſilk is from four to five cocoons.</p><p>When you would join a freſh thread, you muſt lay one end on your finger, which you throw lightly on the other threads that are winding, and it joins them immediately, and continues to go up with the reft. You muſt not wind off your cocoons too bare or to the laſt, becauſe when they are near at an end, the <hi rend="italic">bairre,</hi> that is, the husk, joins in with the other threads, and makes the ſilk foul and gouty.</p><p>When you have finiſhed your firſt parcel, you muſt clean your basons, taking out all the ſtriped worms, as well as the cocoons, on which there is a little ſilk, which you firſt open and take out the worm, and then throw them into a baſket by you, into which you likewiſe caſt the looſe ſilk that comes off in making the battue.</p><p>You then proceed as before with other two or three handfuls of cocoons ; you make a new battue ; you purge them, and continue to wind the ſame number of cocoons or their equivalent, and ſo to the end.</p><p>As was already mentioned, the windſter muſt always have a bowl of cold water by her, to ſprinkle the bar, to cool her fingers every time she dips them in the hot water, and to pour into her bason when neceſſary, that is, when her water begins to boil. You muſt be very careful to twiſt your threads a ſufficient number of times, about 25, otherwiſe your ſilk remains flat, inſtead of being round and full ; beſides, when the ſilk is not well croſſed, it never can be clean, becauſe a gout or nub that comes from a cocoon will paſs through a ſmall number of theſe twiſts, though a greater will flop it. Your thread then breaks, and you paſs what foulness there may be in the middle of your reel be</p></body></text></TEI>
