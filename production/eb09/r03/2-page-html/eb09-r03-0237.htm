<p><span class="font4">exceeding IOO feet in diameter. That most of the smaller circles </span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font4"> have been used as sepulchres has been repeatedly proved by actual </span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font4">&nbsp;excavations, which showed that interments had taken place ;&nbsp;within their area. It is difficult, however, to believe that this I&nbsp;could have been the main object of the larger ones. At May- I&nbsp;borough, near Penrith, there is a circle entirely composed of an&nbsp;immeuse aggregation of small stones in the form of a gigantic ring&nbsp;enclosing a Hat area, about 300 feet in diameter. Near the centre&nbsp;there is a fine monolith, one of several known to have formerly&nbsp;stood there. Of the same type is the Giant’s Ring near Belfast,&nbsp;only the ring in this instance is made of earth, and it is considerably larger in diameter (580 feet) ; the central object is a fine&nbsp;dolmen. It is more probable that such enclosures were used, like&nbsp;many of our modern churches, for the double purpose of burying&nbsp;the dead and addressing the living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Dolmens.—</span><span class="font4">In its simplest form a dolmen consists of three, four, or five stone supports, covered over with one selected megalith&nbsp;called a capstone or table. A well-known example of this kind&nbsp;in England is Kit’s Cotty House, between Rochester and Maidstone,&nbsp;which is formed of three large supports, with a capstone measuring&nbsp;11 by 8 feet. From this simple form there is an endless variety of&nbsp;upward gradations till we reach the so-called Gaint Graves and&nbsp;Grottes aux Fées, which are constructed of numerous supports and&nbsp;several capstones. A dolmen (α∕Z&lt;⅛ </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">couverte)</span><span class="font4"> situated in a plantation at the outskirts of the town of Saumur is composed of four&nbsp;flat supports on each side, with one at the end, and four capstones.&nbsp;The Iargestcapstone measures 7'5 metres in length, 7 in breadth,&nbsp;and 1 in thickness. The chamber is 18 metres long, 6<sup>-</sup>5 broad,&nbsp;and 3 high. Another near Esse, called “la Roche aux Fées,” is&nbsp;equally long, and is constructed of thirty supports, with eight&nbsp;capstones, including the vestibule. Dolmens of this kind are&nbsp;extremely rare in the British Isles, the only one approaching them&nbsp;being Calliagh Birra’s HouseinIreland. These (generally known&nbsp;as allées couvertes) and many other examples of the simple dolmen&nbsp;show no evidence of having been covered over with a mound. AVhen&nbsp;there was a mound it necessitated, in the larger ones, an entrance&nbsp;passage, which was constructed, like the chamber, of a series of&nbsp;side stones or supports and capstones. Some archæologists maintain&nbsp;that all dolmens were formerly covered with a cairn or tumulus,&nbsp;—a theory which undoubtedly derives some favour from the&nbsp;condition of many examples still extant, especially in France,&nbsp;where all stages of degradation are seen, from a partial to a complete state of denudation. The allées couvertes of France, Germany, and the Channel Islands had their entrance at the end ; but,&nbsp;on the other hand, the Hunuebedden of Holland had both ends&nbsp;closed and the entrance was on the side facing the sun. The&nbsp;covered dolmens are extremely variable in shape,—circular, oval,&nbsp;quadrangular, or irregular. The entrance gallery may be attached&nbsp;to the end, as in the Grotte de Gavr’inis, or to the side, as in the&nbsp;Gaint’s Grave (Jettestuer) at Oem near Roskilde. In other&nbsp;instances there is no distinct chamber, but a long passage gradually&nbsp;widening from the entrance ; and this may be bent at an angle, as&nbsp;in the dolmen du Rocher(Morbihan). Again, there may be several&nbsp;chambers Cummunieating with one entrance, or two or three&nbsp;separate chambers having separate entrances, and all imbedded in&nbsp;the same tumulus. An excellent example of this kind is the&nbsp;partially destroyed tumulus of Rondosec, near Plouharnal railway&nbsp;station, which contains three separate dolmens. That such variations are not due to altered customs, in consequence of wideness of&nbsp;geographical range, is shown by M. de Mortillet, who gives plans&nbsp;of no less than sixteen differently shaped dolmens </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">{Musée préhistorique,</span><span class="font4"> pi. 58), all within a confined district in Morbihan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No dolmens exist in eastern Europe beyond Saxony. They reappear, however, in the Crimea and Circassia, whence they have&nbsp;been traced through Central Asia to India, where they are widely&nbsp;distributed. Similar megalithic structures have also been recognized and described by travellers in Palestine, Arabia, Persia,&nbsp;Australia, the Penrhyn Islands, Madagascar, Peru, &amp;c. The&nbsp;irregular manner in which dolmens are distributed along the&nbsp;western parts of Europe has led to the theory that all these&nbsp;megalithic structures were erected by a special people, but as to&nbsp;the when, whence, and whither of this singular race there is no&nbsp;knowledge whatever. Though the European dolmens have a&nbsp;strong family likeness, however widely apart, they present some&nbsp;characteristic differences in the various countries in which they are&nbsp;found. In Scandinavia they are confined to the Danish lands and&nbsp;a few provinces in the south of Sweden. Here the exposed dolmens&nbsp;are often on artificial mounds, and surrounded by cromlechs which&nbsp;are either circular </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">GundAysser)</span><span class="font4"> or oval </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(Iangdysser).</span><span class="font4"> In Sweden&nbsp;the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">sepulture Λ galerie</span><span class="font4"> is very rarely entirely covered up as in the&nbsp;giant graves of Denmark.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Hanover, Oldenburg, and Mecklenburg are very rich in the remains of these monuments. At Riestedt, near Uelzen in Hanover,&nbsp;there is, on the summit of a tumulus, a very singular dolmen of&nbsp;oblong form, which measures about 40 feet long and over 6&nbsp;feet in breadth. Another at Naschendorf, near AVismar, consists&nbsp;of a mound surrounded by a large circle of stones and a</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font4">covered chamber on its summit. Remains of a megalithic structure at Rudenbeck, in Mecklenburg, though now imperfect,&nbsp;show that originally it was constructed like an allée couverte.&nbsp;It had four supports on each side, two at one end (the other&nbsp;end forming the entrance), and two large capstones. The length&nbsp;had been about 20 feet, breadth 7$ feet, and height from tho&nbsp;floor to the under-surface of roof about 3 feet. According to&nbsp;Bonstetten, no less than two hundred of these monuments are&nbsp;found distributed over the three provinces of Lüneburg, Osnabrück,&nbsp;and Stade ; and the most gigantic examples in Germany are in the&nbsp;duchy of Oldenburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In Holland, with one or two exceptions, they are confined to the province of Drenthe, where between fifty and sixty still exist.&nbsp;Here they get the name of Hunnebedden (Huns’ beds). The Borger&nbsp;Hunnebed, the largest of this group, is 70 feet long and 14 feet&nbsp;wide. In its original condition it contained forty-five stones, ten&nbsp;of which were capstones. They are all now denuded, but some&nbsp;show evidence of having been surrounded with a mound containing&nbsp;an entrance passage. Only one dolmen has been recorded in&nbsp;Belgium ; but in France their number amounts to 3410. Theyare&nbsp;irregularly distributed over seventy-eight departments, six hundred&nbsp;and eighteen being in Brittany. In the centre of the country&nbsp;they are also numerous, no less than four hundred and thirty-five&nbsp;being recorded in Aveyrpn, but they are of much smaller proportions&nbsp;than in the former locality. From the Pyrenees the dolmens are&nbsp;sparsely traced along the north coast of Spain and through Portugal&nbsp;to Andalusia, where they occur in considerable numbers. Crossing&nbsp;into Africa they are found in large groups in Morocco, Algeria, and&nbsp;Tunis. General Faidherbe writes of having examined five or six&nbsp;thousand at the cemeteries of Bou Merzoug, </span><span class="font0">∖</span><span class="font4">Vady Berda, Tebessa,&nbsp;Gastal, </span><span class="font5">&amp;C.@@<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font4">In the Channel Islands every species of megalithic&nbsp;monument is met with. At Mout Cochon, near St Helier, there&nbsp;was lately discovered in a mound of blown sand an allée couverte,&nbsp;and close to it a stone circle surrounding a dolmen.@@<sup>2</sup> In the&nbsp;British Isles they are met with in many localities, particularly in&nbsp;the west of England, Anglesey, the Isle of Man, Ireland, and Scotland. In the country last named, however, they are not the most&nbsp;striking feature among its rude stone monuments—the stone circles&nbsp;and cistcd cairns having largely superseded them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">In the absence of historical knowledge all these megalithic structures were formerly regarded as of Celtic origin. By some&nbsp;they were supposed to have been constructed by the Druids, the&nbsp;so-called priests of the Celts ; and hence they were often described,&nbsp;especially since the time of Aubrey and Stukely, under the name of&nbsp;Celtic or Dmidical monuments. But this theory is disproved by&nbsp;the fact that the ethnographical range of the Celtic races does not&nbsp;correspond with the geographical distribution of these rude stone&nbsp;monuments. Thus, for example, in Europe, not to speak of their&nbsp;localization in non-Celtic countries, the megaliths occupy an elongated stretch of territory on its western seaboard extending from&nbsp;Pomerania to North Africa. This area crosses at right angles the&nbsp;lands supposed to have been occupied by the Celtic or Aryan&nbsp;races on their westward waves of migration. There can be no&nbsp;doubt from investigations of the contents of dolmens that their&nbsp;primary object was sepulchral, and that the megalithic chambers,&nbsp;with entrance passages, were used as family vaults. Against the&nbsp;theory that any of them were ever used as altars there is </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">prima&nbsp;facie</span><span class="font4"> evidence in the care taken to have the smoothest and flattest&nbsp;surface of the stones composing the chamber always turned&nbsp;inwards. Moreover, cup marks, and other primitive markings&nbsp;when found on the capstones or supports, are almost invariably&nbsp;on their inside, as, for example, at the dolmens of Keriaval, Kercado<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>Dol au Marchant, Gavr’inis (Morbihan), and the great tumulus at&nbsp;New Grange (Ireland). From its position in the centre of a large&nbsp;circular enclosure no dolmen could be more suggestive of public&nbsp;sacrifices than that within the Giant’s Ring near Belfast ; yet&nbsp;nothing could be more inappropriate for such a purpose than its&nbsp;capstone, which is in fact a large granite boulder presenting on&nbsp;its upper side an unusually rounded surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">No chronological sequence can be detected in the evolution of the rude stone monuments, with perhaps the exception of the&nbsp;primitive cist which gave origin to the allées couvertes, giant&nbsp;graves, &amp;c., and these again to the tumuli with microlithic built&nbsp;chambers. Much less can their appearance in different countries&nbsp;be said to indicate contemporaneity. The dolmens of Africa are&nbsp;often found to contain objects peculiar to the Iron Age, and it is&nbsp;said that in some parts of India the people are still in the habit of&nbsp;erecting dolmens and other megalithic monuments. Scandinavian&nbsp;archæologists assign their dolmens exclusively to the Stone Age.&nbsp;It would therefore appear as if a subsequent stage of degradation&nbsp;occurred, when a tamer style of interment ensued, and the Bronze&nbsp;Age barrows replaced the dolmens, and these again gave way to the&nbsp;Iron Age burials—the ship-barrows and large tumuli of the vikings,&nbsp;as manifested in the three tumuli of Thor, Odin, and Freya at</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
