        <p><span class="font2">Prehistoric anthropology is a science of very recent growth in Russia
                ; and, notwithstanding the energy displayed within that&nbsp;field during the last
                twenty years, the task of reconstructing the&nbsp;early history of man on the plains
                of eastern Europe is daily becoming more complicated as new data are brought to
                light. Remains&nbsp;of Palæolitlhic man, contemporary with the large
                Quaternary&nbsp;mammals, are few in Russia ; they are known only in
                Poland,&nbsp;Pottava, and Voronezh, and perhaps also on the Oka. Those of
                the&nbsp;later portions of the Lacustrine period, on the contrary, are
                so&nbsp;numerous that scarcely one old lacustrine basin in the regions of
                the&nbsp;Oka, the Kama, the Dnieper, not to speak of the lake-region
                itself,&nbsp;and even the White Sea coasts, can be mentioned where remains&nbsp;of
                Neolithic man have not been discovered, showing an unexpected&nbsp;variety of minor
                anthropological features, even at that remote&nbsp;period. The Russian plains have
                been, however, the scene of so&nbsp;many migrations of various races of mankind, the
                dwelling-places&nbsp;of prehistoric man and the routes followed during his
                migrations&nbsp;were so clearly indicated by natural conditions, and so often
                reoccupied, or again covered by new waves of colonization and migration, that at
                many places a series of deposits belonging to widely&nbsp;distant epochs are found
                superposed. Settlements belonging to the&nbsp;Stone age, and manufactories of stone

                period—are superposed&nbsp;upon and obliterate one another, so that a long series of
                researches&nbsp;is necessary in order that sound generalizations may be
                reached.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all" />
        <p><span class="font2">Two different races—a brachycephalic and a dolichocephalic—can be
                distinguished among tho remains of the earlier Stone period&nbsp;(Lacustrine period)
                as having inhabited the plains of eastern Europe.&nbsp;But they are separated by so
                many generations from the earliest&nbsp;historic times that sure conclusions
                regarding them are impossible ;&nbsp;at all events, as yet Russian archæologists are
                not agreed as to&nbsp;whether the ancestors of the Slavonians were Sarmatians only
                or&nbsp;Scythians also (Samokvasoff, Lemiere), whose skulls have nothing&nbsp;in
                common with those of the Mongolian race. The earliest points&nbsp;that can,
                comparatively speaking, be regarded as settled must thus&nbsp;be taken from the 1st
                century, when the Northern Finns migrated&nbsp;from the North Dwina region towards
                the west, and the Sarmatians&nbsp;were compelled to leave the region of the Don, and
                to cross the&nbsp;Russian steppes from east to west, under the pressure of the
                Aorzes&nbsp;(the Mordvinian Erzya ?) and Siraks, who in their turn were
                soon&nbsp;followed by the Huns aud the Ugur-Turkish stem of Avars.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">It appears certain, moreover, that in the 7th century southern Russia
                was occupied by the empire of the Khazars </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> who&nbsp;drove the
                Bulgarians, descendants of the Huns, from tho Don, one&nbsp;section of them
                migrating up the Volga to found there the Bulgarian empire, and the remainder
                migrating towards the Danube.&nbsp;This migration compelled the Northern Finns to
                advance farther&nbsp;west, and a mixture of Tavasts and Karelians penetrated to
                the&nbsp;south of the Gulf of Finland.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2"> Finally, it is certain that as early as the 8th century, and
                probably still earlier, a stream of Slavonian colonization, advancing&nbsp;eastward
                from the Danube, was thrown on the plains of southwestern Russia. It is also most
                probable that another similar&nbsp;stream—the northern, coming from the Elbe,
                through the basin of&nbsp;the Vistula—ought to be distinguished. In the 9th century
                the&nbsp;Slavonians already occupied the Upper Vistula, the southern part&nbsp;of
                the lake region, and the central plateau in its western parts.&nbsp;They had
                Lithuanians to the west ; various Finnish stems, mixed&nbsp;towards the south-east
                with Turkish stems (the present Bashkirs) ;&nbsp;the Bulgars, whose origin still
                remains doubtful, on the middle&nbsp;Volga and Kama ; and to the south-east the
                Turkish-Mongolian&nbsp;world of the Petchenegs, Potovtsi, Uzes, &amp;c. ; while in
                the south,&nbsp;along the Black Sea, extended the empire of the Khazars, who
                kept&nbsp;under their rule several Slavonian steins, and perhaps also some
                of&nbsp;Finnish origin. In the 9th century also the Ugrians are supposed&nbsp;to
                have left their Ural abodes and to have crossed south-eastern and&nbsp;southern
                Russia on their way to the basin of the Danube.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">If these numerous migrations on the plains of Russia be taken into
                account, and if we add to them the Mongolian invasion, tho&nbsp;migration of South
                Slavonians towards the Oka, tho North&nbsp;Slavonian colonization extending
                north-east towards tho Urals and&nbsp;thence to Siberia, the slow advance of
                Slavonians into Finnish&nbsp;territory on the Volga, and at a later period their
                advance into the&nbsp;prairies on the Black Sea, driving back the Turkish stems
                which&nbsp;occupied them,—if we consider the manifold mutual influences
                of&nbsp;these three races on one another, we shall be able to form a faint&nbsp;idea
                of the present population of European Russia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">If the Slavonians be subdivided into three branches—the western
                (Poles, Czechs, and Wends), the southern (Serbs, Bulgarians, Croa-tians, &amp;c.),
                and the eastern (Great, Little, and White Russians),&nbsp;it will be seen that, with
                the exception of some 3,000,000&nbsp;Ukrainians or Little Russians, in East Galicia
                and in Poland, and&nbsp;a few on the south slope of the Carpathians, the whole of
                tho&nbsp;East Slavonians occupy, as a compact body, western, central,
                and&nbsp;southern Russia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Like other races of mankind, the Russian race is not a pure one. The
                Russians have taken in and assimilated in the course of their&nbsp;history a variety
                of Finnish and Turco-Finnish elements. Still,&nbsp;Craniological researches show'
                that, notwithstanding this fact, the&nbsp;Slavonian type has maintained itself with
                remarkable persistency—&nbsp;Slavonian skulls ten and thirteen centuries old
                exhibiting the same&nbsp;anthropological features as are seen in those of our own
                day. This&nbsp;may be explained by a variety of causes, of which the chief is
                the&nbsp;maintenance by the Slavonians down to a very late period of
                gentile&nbsp;organization and gentile marriages, a fact vouched for, not only
                in&nbsp;the pages of Nestor, but still more by deep traces still visible in
                tho&nbsp;face of society, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >gens</span><span class="font2"> later on passing into the village
                community,&nbsp;and the colonization being carried on by great compact
                bodies.&nbsp;This has all along maintained the same characters. The Russians&nbsp;do
                not emigrate as isolated individuals ; they migrate in whole&nbsp;villages. The
                overwhelming numbers of the Slavonians, and the&nbsp;very great differences in
                ethnical type, belief, mythology, between&nbsp;the Aryans and Turanians, may have
                contributed in the same&nbsp;direction, and throughout the written history of the
                Slavonians we&nbsp;see that, while a Russian man, far away from his home
                among&nbsp;Siberians, readily marries a native, the Russian woman seldom
                does&nbsp;the like. All these causes, and especially the first-mentioned,
                have&nbsp;enabled the Slavonians to maintain their ethnical features in
