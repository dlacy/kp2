<p><span class="font0">fectually as by a common tie-beam. A nd by ſhorten·· ing BD to B√, we gain a greater infide height, and&nbsp;more room for an arched ceiling. Now if we ſubfti-∙tute a king-poſt BD (fig. 26.) and two ſtretchers or&nbsp;hammer-beams DA, DC for the other ſtrings, and connect them firmly by means of iron ſtraps, we obtain our&nbsp;purpoſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let us compare this roof with a tie-beam roof in point of ſtrain and ſtrength. Recur to fig. 25. and&nbsp;complete the parallelogram ABCF, and draw the diagonals AC, BF croſſing in E. Draw BG perpendicular to CD. We have ſeen that the weight of the&nbsp;root (which we may callW) is to the horizontal thruſt&nbsp;at C as B F to EC ; and if we expreſs this thruſt by</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">W × EC</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">T, we have T = —p-p—. We may at preſent con-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ſider BC as a lever moveable round the joint B, and pulled at C in the direction EC by the horizontal&nbsp;thruſt, and held back by the ſtring pulling in the direction CD. Suppoſe that the forces in the directions&nbsp;EC and CD are in equihbrio, and let us find the force&nbsp;S by which the ſtring CD is ſtrained. Theſe forces&nbsp;muſt (by the property of the lever) be inverſely as the&nbsp;perpendiculars drawn from the centre of motion on the&nbsp;lines of their direction. Therefore BG : BE = T : S,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sub>1</sub> _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„ BE <sub>t</sub> BE.EC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and S _ Γ × <sub>bg</sub>, _ W X <sub>brbg</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Therefore the ſtrain upon each of the ties DA and DC is always greater than the horizontal thruſt or the&nbsp;ſtrain on a fimple tie-beam. This would be no great&nbsp;inconvenience, becauſe the ſmalleſt dimenſions that we&nbsp;could give to theſe ties, ſo as to procure ſufficient fixtures to the adjoining pieces, are always ſufficient to&nbsp;wſthſtand this ſtrain. But although the ſame may be&nbsp;ſaid of the iron ſtraps which make the ultimate connections, there is always ſome hazard of imperfect work,&nbsp;cracks or flaws, which are not perceived. We can&nbsp;judge with tolerable certainty of the ſoundneſs of a&nbsp;piece of timber, but cannot ſay ſo much of a piece of&nbsp;iron. Moreover, there is a prodigious ſtrain excited&nbsp;on the king-poſt, when BG is very ſhort in compariſon&nbsp;of BE, namely, the force compounded of the two ſtrains&nbsp;8 and S on the ties DA and DC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But there is another defect from which the ſtraight tie-beam is entirely free. All roofs fettle a little.—&nbsp;When this roof ſettles, and the points B and D de-ſcend, the legs BA, BC muſt ſpread further out, and&nbsp;thus a preſſure outwards is excited on the walls. It is&nbsp;ieldom therefore that this kind of roof can be executed&nbsp;in this ſimple form, and other contrivances are neceſſary&nbsp;for counteracting this ſupervening action on the walls.&nbsp;Fig. 27. is one of the beſt wſhich we have ſeen, and is&nbsp;executed with great ſucceſs in the circus or equeſtrian&nbsp;theatre in Edinburgh, the width being 60 feet. The&nbsp;pieces EF and ED help to take off ſome of the weight,&nbsp;and by their greater uprightneſs they exert a ſmaller&nbsp;thruſt on the walls. The beam D </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> is alſo a fort of&nbsp;truſs-beam, having fomething </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the ſame effect. Mr&nbsp;Price has given another very judicious one of this&nbsp;kind, Britiſh Carpenter, Plate IK, fig. C, from which&nbsp;the tie-beam may be taken away, and there will remain&nbsp;very little thruſt on the walls. Thoſe which he has given in the following Plate K are, in our opinion, very&nbsp;faulty. The whole ſtrain in theſe laſt roofs tends to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Break the rafters and </span><span class="font0">ties tranſverſely, and the fixtures-of&nbsp;the ties are alſo not well calculated to refill the ſtrain&nbsp;to wſhich the pieces are expoſed. W e hardly think that&nbsp;theſe roofs could be executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is ſcarcely neceſſary to remind the reader, that in all that we have delivered on this ſubject, we have at-1&nbsp;tended only to the conſtruction of the principal rafters&nbsp;or truſſes. In ſmall buildings all the rafters are of one&nbsp;kind ; but in great buildings the whole weight of the&nbsp;covering is made to reſt on a few principal rafters,&nbsp;which are connected by beams placed horizontally, and&nbsp;either mortiſed into them or ſcarfed on them. Theſe&nbsp;are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">purlins.</span><span class="font0"> Small rafters are laid from purlin to&nbsp;purlin ; and on theſe the laths for tiles, or the ſkirting-boards for liâtes, are nailed. Thus the covering does&nbsp;not immediately reſt on the principal frames This allows ſome more liberty in their conſtruction, becauſe the&nbsp;garrets can be ſo divided that the principal rafters ſhall&nbsp;be in the partitions and the reſt left unincumbered.&nbsp;This conſtruction is ſo ſar analogous to that of ſtoots&nbsp;which are conſtructed with girders, binding, and bridge-ing joiſts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may appear preſuming in us to queſtion the propriety of this practice. There are ſituations in&nbsp;which it is unavoidable, as in the roofs of churches,&nbsp;which can be allowed to reſt on ſome pillars. In other&nbsp;ſituations, where partition-w<sup>,</sup>alls intervene at a diſtance&nbsp;not too great for a ſtout purlin, no principal rafters&nbsp;are neceſſary, and the whole may be roofed with ſhort&nbsp;rafters of very ſlender ſcantling. But in a great uniform roof, which has no intermediate ſupports, it requires at leaſt ſome reafons for preferring this method&nbsp;of carcaſe-roofing to the ſimpler method of making all&nbsp;the rafters alike. The method of carcaſe-rooſing requires the {election of the greateſt logs of timber, which&nbsp;are ſeldom of equal ſtrength and ſoundneſs with thinner&nbsp;rafters. In theſe the outſide planks can be taken off,&nbsp;and the beſt part alone worked up. It alſo expoſes to&nbsp;all the defects of workmanſhip in. the mortiſing of pur-lins, and the weakening of the rafters by this very&nbsp;mortiſing ; and it brings an additional load of purlins&nbsp;and ſhort rafters. A roof thus conſtructed may ſurely&nbsp;be compared with a floor of limilar conſtruction. Here&nbsp;there is not a ſhadow of doubt, that if the girders were&nbsp;ſawed into planks, and theſe planks laid as joiſts ſuſſici-ently near for carrying the flooring boards, they will&nbsp;have the ſame ſtrength as before, except ſo much as is&nbsp;taken out of the timber by the ſaw. This will not&nbsp;amount to one-tenrh part of the timber in the binding,&nbsp;bridging, and ceiling joiſts, which are an additional&nbsp;load ; and all the mortiſes and other joinings are fo&nbsp;many diminutions of the ſtrength of the girders ; and&nbsp;as no part of a carpenter’s w<sup>τ</sup>ork requires more ſkill and&nbsp;accuracy of execution, we are expoſed to many chances&nbsp;of imperfection. But, not to reſt on theſe confidera-tions, however reafonable they may appear, we ſhall relate an experiment made by one on whoſe judgment&nbsp;and exactneſs we can depend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two models of floors were made 18 inches ſquare of the ſineſt uniform deal, wſhich had been long lealoned.&nbsp;The one confiſted of ſimple joiſts, and the other was&nbsp;framed with girders, binding, bridging, and ceiling&nbsp;joiſts. The plain joiſts of the one contained the ſame&nbsp;quantity of tirA&gt;er with the girders alone of the other,&nbsp;and both were made by a moſt accurate workman.&nbsp;They were placed in wooden trunks 18 inches ſquare</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
