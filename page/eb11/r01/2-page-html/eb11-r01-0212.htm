<p><span class="font1">and is the ancestor of the sheriff, the shire-reeve. In addition to the sheriff there were several kinds of reeves, and we are told&nbsp;in the body of laws known as the laws of Edward the Confessor&nbsp;that it is “ multiplex nomen; greve enim dicitur de scira, de&nbsp;wapentagiis, de hundredis, de burgis, de villis.” Thus we hear&nbsp;of port-reeves, burg-reeves, and tun-reeves, while the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle mentions high reeves. It was the tun-reeve&nbsp;or reve of the township who with four other men represented&nbsp;the township in the courts of the hundred and the shire. In&nbsp;free townships he was probably chosen by the inhabitants; in&nbsp;dependent townships by the lord. A little later there were&nbsp;manor reeves, these being elected by the villains; according&nbsp;to Fleta, their duties were to attend to the cultivation of the&nbsp;land, and to see that each villain performed his proper share of&nbsp;service. The reve of Chaucer’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Canterbury Tales</span><span class="font1"> was doubtless&nbsp;a steward or bailiff, something equivalent to the grieve in&nbsp;Scotland to-day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In early English the word reeve was sometimes used as a translation for the prefect or governor of Roman and Jewish times. Some authorities have thought that there is some connexion&nbsp;between the Anglo-Saxon </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gerefa</span><span class="font0"> and the German </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Graf,</span><span class="font0"> but Max&nbsp;Müller </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Lectures on the Science of Language,</span><span class="font0"> 1885) is inclined to&nbsp;doubt this. J. M. Kemble </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Saxons in England,</span><span class="font0"> 1876), who goes&nbsp;at length into the history of the reeve, connects the word with&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rófan</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">réfan,</span><span class="font0"> to call aloud, this making him the original of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bannitor,</span><span class="font0"> or proclaimer of the court. At the present time the&nbsp;word reeve is sometimes used to describe a foreman or overseer in a&nbsp;coal mine. It is also used in Canada for the president of a village&nbsp;or town council.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REEVES, JOHN SIMS (1818-1900), English vocalist, was born at Woolwich on the 26th of September 1818, and received&nbsp;his musical education from his father, a musician in the&nbsp;Royal Artillery. At the age of fourteen he had progressed&nbsp;so far as to be appointed organist of North Cray church, and&nbsp;could play the oboe, bassoon, violin, and violoncello. He&nbsp;seems to have studied medicine for a year, but changed his&nbsp;mind when he gained his adult voice: it was at first a baritone,&nbsp;and he made his earliest appearance at Newcastle in 1839 in&nbsp;various baritone parts. He studied with Hobbs and T. Cooke,&nbsp;and, his voice having become a tenor, he appeared under&nbsp;Macready’s management at Drury Lane (1841-43) in subordinate tenor parts in PurceIl’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">King Arthur, Der Freischütz,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Acis and Galatea,</span><span class="font1"> when Handel’s pastoral was mounted on the&nbsp;stage with Stanfield’s scenery. Four years were spent in study&nbsp;on the Continent, under Bordogni in Paris and Mazzucato in&nbsp;Milan, and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">début</span><span class="font1"> in Italian opera was made at the Scala as&nbsp;Edgardo in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lucia.</span><span class="font1"> He reappeared in London in May 1847&nbsp;at a benefit concert for Vincent Wallace, and at one of the&nbsp;Ancient Concerts in the following month, his career on the&nbsp;English operatic stage beginning at Drury Lane in December&nbsp;1847 in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lucia,</span><span class="font1"> under the conductorship of Hector Berlioz. In&nbsp;Balfe’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Maid of Honour</span><span class="font1"> he created the part of Lyonnel in the&nbsp;same season. In 1848 he went to Her Majesty’s Theatre,&nbsp;singing in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Linda di Chamounix',</span><span class="font1"> and in the autumn of that year,&nbsp;at the Norwich Festival, made a great sensation in “ The&nbsp;enemy said,” from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Israel in Egypt,</span><span class="font1"> a song in which the finest&nbsp;qualities of his ringing voice could be appreciated. From his&nbsp;first appearance at the Sacred Harmonic Society in the following&nbsp;November he was recognized as the leading English tenor; and&nbsp;in Costa’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eli</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Naaman</span><span class="font1"> the tenor parts were written for him.&nbsp;His first Handel Festival was that of 1857, and the effect of his&nbsp;wonderful declamation in the Crystal Palace was a main attrac-tion of this and of many subsequent festivals. His retirement&nbsp;from public life, at first announced as to take place in 1882,&nbsp;did not actually occur till 1891, when a farewell concert for his&nbsp;benefit was given at the Albert Hall. His savings were invested&nbsp;in an unfortunate speculation, and he was compelled to reappear&nbsp;in public for a number of years. He died at Worthing on the&nbsp;25th of October 1900.</span></p>
