The principal rules are new, are so easy, so extensive in their use, and so consistent with expedition and legibility, if applied with judgment, that they alone might suffice. The learner is however advised by no means to adopt any of them till experience has convinced him that they may be used without error, or injury to legibility. All abbreviating rules are suited to those only who have made some progress in the stenographic art ; for although they certainly promote expedition in a wonderful manner, and afford the greatest ease to a proficient, yet a learner, as expedition is not his first, though his ultimate view, should admit of nothing that in the least renders the reading difficult.</p><p>II. The English alphabet consists of twenty-six letters; six of which are vowels, <hi rend="italic">a, e, i</hi>, <hi rend="italic">o, u,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y;</hi> and the other twenty consonants, <hi rend="italic">b, c, d, f g, h, j, h, l, m, n, p, g, r, s, t, v, w, x,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">z</hi>. This alphabet, as is observed by the best grammarians that have written on the language, is both defective and redundant in expressing the various modifications of sound.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Custom or prejudice has assigned some letters a place, when others would with much more propriety express the same sound ; and to this may be added, that several letters, sometimes in one word, seem to be admitted for no other reason than to perplex a young beginner or a foreigner, as an obstruction to true pronunciation, and to add to the apparent length of the word, when they are entirely quiescent and useless. That this is the genius of the orthography of our language, must be perceived by the most superficial observer ; but no modern tongue is absolutely free from the same exceptions. In particular, the French has a great number of dormant etters, which, it is obvious, render the pronunciation more difficult and perplexing to learners. In this respect, the Latin and Greek claim a just superiority over the modern tongues. In them no confusion or doubt can arise from the manner of spelling ; and the reader can scarcely be wrong, unless in quantity, in sounding all the letters that he sees.</p><p>But as it is neither our business nor our intention to propose a mode of spelling different from that in common use, when applied to printing or long-hand writing (since several innovators in orthography have fallen into contempt, and their plans have been only preserved as beacons to warn others of the folly of endeavouring to subvert established principles@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi>), we shall only observe, that in stenography, where the most expeditious and concise method is the best, if consistent with perspicuity, the following simple rules are studiously to be regarded and practised.</p><p>1.	All quiescent consonants in words are to be dropped, and the orthography to be directed only by the pronunciation ; which being known to all, will render this art attainable by those who cannot spell with precision in long-hand.</p><p>2.	When the absence of consonants, not entirely dormant, can be easily known, they may often be omitted without the least obscurity.</p><p>3.	Two or sometimes more consonants may, to promote greater expedition, be exchanged for a single one of nearly similar sound ; and no ambiguity as to the meaning ensue.’</p><p>4.	When two consonants of the same kind or same sound come together, without any vowel between them, only one is to be expressed ; but if a vowel or vowels intervene, both arc to be written : only observe, if they arc perpendicular, horizontal, or oblique lines, they must only be drawn a size longer than usual ; and characters with loops must have the size of their heads doubled.</p><p>Might is to be written <hi rend="italic">mit,</hi> fight <hi rend="italic">fit,</hi> machine <hi rend="italic">mashin, </hi>enough, <hi rend="italic">enuf,</hi> laugh <hi rend="italic">laf,</hi> prophet <hi rend="italic">profit,</hi> physics <hi rend="italic">fisiks, </hi>through <hi rend="italic">thro',</hi> foreign <hi rend="italic">foren,</hi> sovereign <hi rend="italic">sοveren,</hi> psalm <hi rend="italic">sam, </hi>receipt <hi rend="italic">reset,</hi> write <hi rend="italic">rite,</hi> wright <hi rend="italic">rti</hi>, island <hi rend="italic">iland,</hi> knavery <hi rend="italic">narery,</hi> temptation <hi rend="italic">tentation,</hi> knife <hi rend="italic">nife,</hi> stick <hi rend="italic">stih,</hi> thigh <hi rend="italic">thi,</hi> honour <hi rend="italic">onoιιr,</hi> indictment <hi rend="italic">indilement,</hi> acquaint <hi rend="italic">aquaint, </hi>chaos <hi rend="italic">hαos,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>Strength <hi rend="italic">strenlh,</hi> length <hi rend="italic">tenth,</hi> friendship <hi rend="italic">frenship,</hi> connect <hi rend="italic">conek,</hi> commandment <hi rend="italic">comanment,</hi> conjunct <hi rend="italic">conjunt, </hi>humble <hi rend="italic">hurnle,</hi> lumber <hi rend="italic">lumer,</hi> slumber <hi rend="italic">slumer,</hi> number <hi rend="italic">numer,</hi> exemplary <hi rend="italic">exemlary,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>Rocks <hi rend="italic">roτ,</hi> acts <hi rend="italic">ahs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ax, </hi>facts<hi rend="italic"> fahs </hi>or<hi rend="italic"> fax,</hi> districts <hi rend="italic">dis- triks</hi> or <hi rend="italic">distrix,</hi> affects <hi rend="italic">afeks</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nfix,</hi> afflicts <hi rend="italic">afliks</hi> or <hi rend="italic">aflix, </hi>conquer <hi rend="italic">konkr,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>Letter <hi rend="italic">leter,</hi> little <hi rend="italic">litle,</hi> command <hi rend="italic">comand,</hi> error <hi rend="italic">eror, </hi>terror <hi rend="italic">teror,</hi> &amp;c. But in <hi rend="italic">remember, moment, sister,</hi> and such like words, where two consonants of the same name have an intervening vowel, both of them must be written.</p><p>These four rules, with their examples, being carefully considered by the learner, will leave him in no doubt concerning the disposition and management of the consonants in this scheme of short writing; we shall therefore proceed to lay down rules for the application of the vowels with ease and expedition.</p><p>1.	Vowels, being only simple articulate sounds, though they are the connectives of consonants, and employed in every word and every syllable, are not necessary to be inserted in the middle of words ; because the consonants, if fully pronounced, with the assistance of connection, will always discover the meaning of a word, and make the writing perfectly legible.</p><p>2.	If a vowel is not strongly accented in the incipient syllable of a word, or if it is mute in the final, it is likewise to be omitted ; because the sound of the incipient vowel is often implied in that of the first consonant, which will consequently supply its place.</p><p>3.	But if the vowel constitutes the first or last syllable of a word, or is strongly accented at its beginning or end, that vowel is continually to be written.</p><p>4.	If a word begins or ends with two or more vowels though separated, or when there is a coalition of vowels, as in diphthongs and triphthongs, only one of them is to be expressed, which must be that which agrees best with the pronunciation.</p><p>5.	In monosyllables, if they begin or end with a vowel, it is always to be inserted, unless the vowel be <hi rend="italic">e</hi> mute at the end of a word.</p><p>Such are the general principles of this art ; in vindication and support of which it will be needless to offer any arguments, when it is considered that brevity and expedition are the cbief objects, if consistent with legibility ; and the subsequent specimens in the orthography recommended will, we hope, be sufficient to show that there is no real deficiency in the last-mentioned particular.</p><p>He who md us mst be etrnl, grt, nd mnptnt.
