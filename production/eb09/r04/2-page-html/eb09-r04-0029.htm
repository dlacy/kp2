                    cargoes carried. Within Russia proper, from 5740 to 7400 boats,&nbsp;larger and
                    smaller, worth from four to seven millions of roubles,&nbsp;have been built
                    annually during the last five years (7415 boats,&nbsp;valued at 6,758,000
                    roubles, in 1882,—18 of them being steamers) ;&nbsp;most of them are light
                    flat-bottomed structures, which are broken&nbsp;up as soon as they have reached
                    their destination. The number of&nbsp;steamers plying on inland waters, chiefly
                    on the Volga, was estimated in 1879 at 1056 (80,890 horse-power).</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Twenty-five years ago Russia had only 993 miles of railways ; on
                    January 1, 1883, the totals were 13,428 miles for Russia and&nbsp;Caucasia, 8S8
                    for Poland, 734 for Finland, and 141 for the&nbsp;Transcaspian region, and two
                    years later they had reached an aggregate length of 16,155 miles. The railways
                    chiefly connect the&nbsp;Baltic ports with the granaries of Russia in the
                    south-east, and the&nbsp;western frontier with Moscow, whence six trunk lines
                    radiate in all&nbsp;directions. Several military lines run along the western
                    frontier,&nbsp;while two trunk lines, starting from St Petersburg, follow the
                    two&nbsp;shores of the Gulf of Finland. Of the projected Siberian
                    railway&nbsp;one main line (444 miles), connecting Perm and Berezniki on
                    the&nbsp;Kama with Ekaterinburg and the chief iron-works of the Urals,
                    has&nbsp;been constructed. It has been extended east to Kamyshkofl, and
                    is&nbsp;to be continued to Tinmen, 100 miles farther east, whence
                    steamers&nbsp;ply to Tomsk.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">Only 738 miles of the railways of Russia belong to the state, but
                    most of them have been constructed under Government guarantees, involving
                    payment of from 11 to 21 million roubles yearly.&nbsp;On the other hand the
                    yearly increasing debt of the railways to the&nbsp;state amounted to 781,888,800
                    roubles in 1883. Of the aggregate&nbsp;value of the Russian railways, estimated
                    at 2210 million roubles, no&nbsp;less than 1971 million roubles were held by
                    Government in shares&nbsp;and bonds. The cost of construction has been
                    altogether out of&nbsp;proportion to what it ought to be ; for, whereas the
                    average rate&nbsp;per verst (0’663 mile) in Finland was only 20,000 silver
                    roubles, in&nbsp;Russia it reached 60,000, 75,000, 90,000, and even 100,000
                    roubles.&nbsp;In 1882 21,322 versts (14,136 miles) represented an
                    expenditure&nbsp;of 2,210,047,632 roubles, and their net revenue was only 3'18
                    per&nbsp;cent, on the capital invested (4982 roubles per English mile
                    in&nbsp;1882). In 1884 34,674,853 passengers, 2,287,955 military,
                    and&nbsp;834,500,000 cwts. of merchandise were conveyed by 5808 locomotives and
                    120,940 carriages and waggons. Fully one-half of the&nbsp;merchandise carried
                    consisted of corn (24 per cent.), coal (13 per&nbsp;cent.), firewood (12 per
                    cent.), and timber (8 per cent.). @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>

                History.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The Russians, properly so called, belong to the Slavonic race,
                    itself a division of the great Aryan family. It cannot be denied that in the
                    northern and eastern parts of&nbsp;Russia large Finnish elements have become
                    mixed with&nbsp;the Slavs, and Mongolian in the south, but this is far&nbsp;from
                    justifying the prejudiced attempts of Duchinski and&nbsp;others to challenge the
                    right of the Russians to be&nbsp;called an Aryan people. The derivation of the
                    words Russia,&nbsp;Russians </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">(Rous, Rossia, Rossiane),</span><span class="font1">
                    has been much disputed.&nbsp;The old-fashioned view was to identify them with

                    Professor Thomsen of Copenhagen to be itself a corruption of the Swedish

            <p><span class="font1">vikings with whom we first become acquainted in northern Russia,
                    and who in a way founded the empire, although&nbsp;from Arabian and Jewish
                    writers we have dim records of&nbsp;a Slavonic race inhabiting the basin of the
                    Dnieper about&nbsp;the close of the 9th century. In recent times
                    Ilovaiski&nbsp;and Gedeonoff have again attacked the view of the
                    Swedish&nbsp;origin of the invaders. They see in them only Slavs, but&nbsp;they
                    are not considered to have shaken the theory which&nbsp;derives the name from
                    Ruotsi. As the story goes, three&nbsp;brothers, Rurik, Sineus, and Truvor, were
                    invited to Russia&nbsp;from the north and settled at Novgorod in 862.
                    Nestor&nbsp;calls them Varangians, a name in which most people are&nbsp;willing
                    to see Norsemen. For a long time the Russians&nbsp;and Scandinavians are
                    considered, as we shall find, to be&nbsp;separate races, but at length they are
                    fused, as the Saxons&nbsp;and Normans in England under Henry I.
                    Concerning&nbsp;the origin of the town of Novgorod, which bears a
                    purely&nbsp;Slavonic name, nothing is known ; it has been supposed&nbsp;that at
                    first a Finnish settlement existed on its site.&nbsp;According to the legend the
                    three brothers were invited&nbsp;over by a leading citizen named Gostomisl.
                    There is,&nbsp;however, no mention of such a person in the </span><span
                    class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font1">
                    of&nbsp;Nestor. There is another story that Rurik was the son&nbsp;of the
                    Swedish king, Ludbrat, a person met with in&nbsp;Scandinavian legend, and his
                    queen Umila, the daughter&nbsp;of Gostomisl, and was born at Upsala in 830.
                    Whatever&nbsp;the variants of the legend may be, we seem to learn
                    one&nbsp;thing,—that a successful Scandinavian invasion occurred&nbsp;in the
                    north of Russia. The three brothers finally settled&nbsp;in the country,—Rurik
                    at Ladoga, where the river&nbsp;Volkhoff flows into the lake, Sineus at
                    Bielo-ozero, and&nbsp;Truvor at Izborsk on Lake Peipus. On the death of&nbsp;his
                    two brothers without heirs, we are told that Rurik&nbsp;annexed their dominions
                    to his own, and took the title of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">veliki kniaz,</span><span class="font1"> or
                    grand-prince. These three brothers are&nbsp;said to have brought two other
                    adventurers with them,&nbsp;Askold and Dir, who, having had a quarrel with
                    Rurik,&nbsp;set out with some companions to Constantinople to try&nbsp;their
                    fortune. On their way they saw Kieff, situated on a&nbsp;rich and grassy plain,
                    in the occupation of the Khazars. Of&nbsp;this city they made themselves
                    masters, and permanently&nbsp;established themselves on the Dnieper. The origin
                    of&nbsp;Kieff itself is involved in mystery. It is first mentioned&nbsp;about
                    the 9th century. Constantine Porphyrogenitus speaks&nbsp;of to </span><span

                    the gospel to the Russians. From this place&nbsp;Askold and Dir sallied forth
                    two years afterwards, with&nbsp;an armament of two hundred vessels, sailed up
                    the Bosphorus, and plundered the capital of the Byzantine empire.&nbsp;The Greek
                    writers give 851 as the date of this enterprise, thus making it precede the
                    arrival of Rurik by&nbsp;eleven years. The emperor at the time of their
                    invasion&nbsp;was Michael III.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Having greatly extended his dominions by subduing the surrounding
                    Slavonic tribes, Rurik died at an advanced&nbsp;age in 879, leaving the regency
                    of the principality and the&nbsp;guardianship of his son Igor to the renowned
                    Oleg. @@<sup>3</sup> This&nbsp;chief subdued Smolensk, a city of the Krivitchi,
                    in 882.&nbsp;Allured by its wealth and advantageous situation, Oleg&nbsp;now
                    resolved to attempt Kieff, which was held by Askold&nbsp;and Dir. The story goes
                    that he took young Igor with&nbsp;him, and disguised himself and his companions
                    as Slavonic&nbsp;merchants. The unsuspecting Askold and Dir were invited&nbsp;to
                    a conference and slain on the spot. Thus was Kieff&nbsp;added to the dominions
