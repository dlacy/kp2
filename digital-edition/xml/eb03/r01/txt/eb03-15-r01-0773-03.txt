RACE
in general, signifies running with others in order to obtain a prize, either on foot, or by riding on horseback, in chariots, &c.
The race was one of the exercises among the an-cient Grecian games, which was performed in a course containing 125 paces; and thofe who cβntended in thefe foot-races were frequently clothed in armour. Chariot and horse races also made a part of thefe ancient games.
Races were known in England in very early times. Fitz-Stephen, who wrote in the days of Henry IT. mentions the great delight that the citizens of London took in the diverfioι‰ But by his words, it appears not to have been designed for the purposes of gaming, but merely to have sprung from a generous emulation of showing a fuperior skill in horsemanship.
Races appear to have been in vogue in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and to have been carried to such excess as to injure the fortunes of the nobility. The fa-mous George earl of Cumberland is recorded to have wafted more of his estate than any of his ancestors ; and chiefly by his extreme love to horse-races, tiltings, and other expensive diverfions. It is probable that the parsimonious queen did not approve of it ; for races are not among the diverfions exhibited at Kennelworth by her favourite Leicester. In the following reign, were places allotted for the sport: Croydon in the fouth, and Garterly in Yorkshire, were celebrated courses. Cam-den also fays, that in 1607 there were races near York, and the prize was a little golden bell. See
