<p><span class="font2">the 'ordinary way.' The universities </span><span class="font0">are </span><span class="font2">also exempt from the general law of registration. At Oxford and Cambridge the members&nbsp;of Convocation and the Senate respectively have always formed&nbsp;the parliamentary constituencies; and, as has been already stated,&nbsp;the registers of those members were before 1832, and still arc,&nbsp;the parliamentary registers. Similarly, the Reform Act of 1867,&nbsp;which gave parliamentary representation to the university of&nbsp;London, simply enacted that the register of graduates constituting&nbsp;the Convocation should be the parliamentary register of that body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland.—</span><span class="font2">In Scotland the qualifications for local government and parish electors are the same as those for parliamentary voters,&nbsp;the only difference in the registers being in respect of personal&nbsp;incapacities for the parliamentary franchise, incapacity for the&nbsp;other franchises by reason of non-payment of rates,, and duplicates.&nbsp;The principal act regulating registration in burghs is 19 &amp; 20 Vict.&nbsp;c. 58, amended in some particulars as to dates by 31 &amp; 32 Vict.&nbsp;c. 48, § 20. County registration, formerly regulated by 24 &amp; 25&nbsp;Vict. c. 83, has been assimilated to burgh registration by 48 &amp; 49&nbsp;Vict. c. 3, § 8 (6). The procedure consists, as in. England, of the&nbsp;making and publication of lists of voters, the making of claims and&nbsp;objections and the holding of revision courts; but there are important differences of detail. Though the parish is the registration&nbsp;unit, parochial machinery is not used for the formation of the&nbsp;register. The parliamentary lists for a county are made up yearly&nbsp;by one or more of the assessors of the county, and those for a burgh&nbsp;by one or more of the assessors for the burgh, or by the clerk of the&nbsp;commissioners. They are published on the 15th of September;&nbsp;and claims and objections must be sent in by the 21st and are&nbsp;published on the 25th of the same month. Publication is made&nbsp;in burghs by posting on or near the town hall, or in some other&nbsp;conspicuous place, in counties by posting the part relating to each&nbsp;parish on the parish church door, and in both cases giving notice&nbsp;by newspaper advertisement of a place where the lists may be&nbsp;perused. The revision is conducted by the sheriff, the time within&nbsp;which his courts may be held being from the 25th of September to&nbsp;the 16th of October, both days inclusive. An appeal lies to three&nbsp;judges of the Court of Session, one taken from each division of the&nbsp;Inner House, and one from the Lords Ordinary of the Outer House.&nbsp;The revised lists are delivered in counties to the sheriff clerk, in&nbsp;burghs to the town clerk, or person to. whom the registration duties&nbsp;of town clerk are assigned. The register comes into force for all&nbsp;purposes on the ist of November.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The municipal register of a royal burgh which is coextensive, or of that part of a royal burgh which is coextensive with a parliamentary burgh, consists of the parliamentary register with a supplemental list of women who but for their sex would be qualified for&nbsp;the parliamentary vote. The municipal register for a burgh, or&nbsp;for that part of one which is not within a parliamentary burgh,&nbsp;consists of . persons possessed of qualifications within the burgh&nbsp;which, if within a parliamentary burgh, would entitle them, or but&nbsp;for their sex would entitle them, to the parliamentary vote. The&nbsp;register of county electors consists of the parliamentary register for&nbsp;a county with the supplemental list hereafter mentioned; but&nbsp;inasmuch as exemption, from or* failure to pay the consolidated&nbsp;county rate is a disqualification for the county electors’ franchise,&nbsp;the names of persons so disqualified are to be marked with a distinctive mark on the register; as are also the names of persons&nbsp;whose qualifications are situated within a burgh, such marks indicating that the persons to whose names they are attached are not&nbsp;entitled to vote as county electors. Every third year, in preparation for the triennial elections of county and parish councils&nbsp;(casual vacancies being filled up by co-optation), a supplemental&nbsp;list is to be made of peers and women possessed of qualifications&nbsp;which but for their rank and sex would entitle them to parliamentary votes. The register of county electors in a county and the&nbsp;municipal register in a burgh form the registers of parish electors&nbsp;for the parishes comprised in each respectively.. Inasmuch, however, as a man is entitled to be registered as a parish elector in every&nbsp;parish where he is qualified, duplicate entries are, when required,&nbsp;to be made in the register, with distinctive marks to all but one,&nbsp;to indicate that they confer the parish vote only. These distinctive marks and those previously mentioned are to be made in&nbsp;the lists, by the assessors, subject to revision by the sheriff. The&nbsp;register is conclusive to the same extent as in England, except that&nbsp;the vote of a parish elector who is one year in arrear in payment&nbsp;of a parish rate is not to be received. The clerk of the parish&nbsp;council is. to furnish the returning officer one week before an&nbsp;election, with the names of persons so in arrear; and the returning&nbsp;officer is to reject their votes except upon the production of a&nbsp;written receipt.. Provision is made by 31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 48, §§ 27-41,&nbsp;for the. formation of registers of parliamentary electors for the&nbsp;universities. The register for each university is to be made annually&nbsp;by the university registrar, with the assistance of two members of,&nbsp;the council, from whose decisions an appeal lies to the university&nbsp;court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland.</span><span class="font2">—There are no parish councils in Ireland, and no parochial electors. There are therefore but two registers of voters, the parliamentary and the local government registers, the latter&nbsp;of which consists of the former with </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">local government supplement&nbsp;containing the names of those excluded from the parliamentary&nbsp;register by reason of their being peers or women, and- duplicate&nbsp;entries relating to those whose names are registered elsewhere for&nbsp;the same parliamentary constituency. The principal acts regulating registration are 13'&amp; 14 Vict. c. 69, 31 &amp; 32 Vict. c. 112, 48 &amp;&nbsp;49 Vict. c. 17, and 61 &amp; 62 Viet. c. 2. The lord lieutenant is&nbsp;empowered to make by Order in Council rules for registration,&nbsp;and to prescribe forms; and under this power has made the Registration (Ireland) Rules 1899, now in force. The registration&nbsp;unit is not the parish, but the district electoral division, except&nbsp;where such division is subdivided -into wards, or is partly within&nbsp;and partly without any town or ward of a borough or town, in which&nbsp;cases each ward of the division or part of a division is a separate&nbsp;registration unit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The procedure is as follows, subject to variation in cases where there are clerks of unions who held office on the 31st of March 1898,&nbsp;and have not agreed to transfer their registration duties. The&nbsp;clerk of the peace sends out on the ist of June a precept in the form&nbsp;prescribed for county registration to the secretary of the county&nbsp;council and clerks of urban district councils, together with a copy&nbsp;of the existing register for their county or district; and a precept&nbsp;in the form prescribed for borough registration to town clerks of&nbsp;boroughs. As regards registration units not in a parliamentary&nbsp;or municipal borough, the secretary of the county council or clerk&nbsp;of the urban district council is to put marginal objections, “ dead ”&nbsp;or “ objected,” where required, to £10 occupiers and householders&nbsp;in the copy of the register, both in the parliamentary list and in&nbsp;the local government supplement. He is also to make out supplemental parliamentary and local government lists of £10 occupiers&nbsp;and householders not on the existing register, and to put marginal&nbsp;objections where required to these. He is to verify on oath before&nbsp;a magistrate the copy of the register and supplemental lists, and&nbsp;to return them to the clerk of the peace by the 8th ’of July. As&nbsp;regards registration units in a parliamentary borough, but outside&nbsp;a municipal borough, the secretary of the county council or clerk&nbsp;of the urban district council is to make out lists of £10 occupiers&nbsp;and householders with local government supplement, and transmit&nbsp;them to the town clerk </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">the municipal borough or town. The&nbsp;clerk of the peace is to publish the copy of the register, after himself&nbsp;placing marginal objections where required to voters other than&nbsp;£10 occupiers and householders, and the supplemental lists as received, and also the corrupt and illegal practices list, if any, on the&nbsp;22nd of July. On the same day the town clerk will publish the&nbsp;lists received as aforesaid for registration units outside the municipal borough, and the lists, which he will have made out himself&nbsp;for the municipal borough, including the freemen’s list and corrupt&nbsp;and illegal practices list. Freemen being entitled to the local&nbsp;government vote will, if resident, be placed on the list of the registration unit, where they reside, and will, if non-resident, be allotted&nbsp;by the revising barrister among the registration units of the borough&nbsp;for local government purposes in proportion to the number of&nbsp;electors in each registration unit. Claims are to be sent in to the&nbsp;clerk of the peace and.town clerk by the 4th of August, including&nbsp;old lodger claims and, in the case of the clerk of the peace, ownership, claims. Lists of claimants with marginal objections, where&nbsp;required, are to be published by the clerk of the peace and town&nbsp;clerk by the nth of August. Notices of objection to voters or&nbsp;claimants may be given by the 20th of August; and lists of persons&nbsp;objected to are to be published by the clerk of the peace and town&nbsp;clerk by the 24th of the same, month. Publication of lists and&nbsp;notices by a clerk of the peace is made by posting copies of those&nbsp;relating to each registration unit outside every court-house, petty&nbsp;sessions court, and other public offices in the unit; publication by&nbsp;a town clerk is made by posting copies outside the town hall, or,&nbsp;if there be none, in some public and conspicuous place in the&nbsp;borough.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Revising barristers are specially appointed for the county and city of Dublin by the lord lieutenant; elsewhere the county court&nbsp;judges and chairmen of quarter sessions act as such </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ex Officio<sub>1&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font2"> assisted, when necessary, by additional barristers appointed by&nbsp;the lord lieutenant. The time for the holding of revision courts&nbsp;is from the 8th of September to the 25th of October inclusive. An&nbsp;appeal lies to the court of appeal, whose decision is final. The&nbsp;revised lists are handed to the clerk of the peace; they are to be&nbsp;made up by him by the 31st of December, and come into force on&nbsp;the ist of January.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The registrar of the university of Dublin is to make out in December a list of the persons entitled to the parliamentary vote&nbsp;for the university, and to print the same in January, and to publish&nbsp;a copy in the university calendar, or in one or. more public journals&nbsp;circulating in Irelapd. He is to revise the list annually, and expunge the names of those dead or disqualified; but an elector&nbsp;whose, name has been expunged because he . was supposed to be&nbsp;dead is entitled, if alive, to have his name immediately restored&nbsp;and to vote at any election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(L. </span><span class="font2">L.
