<p><span class="font0">In the ſeventh volume of the Tranſactions of the Society inſtituted at London for the Encouragement of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce, there is explained&nbsp;a method of ſupplying the loſs of a ſhip’s rudder at ſea.&nbsp;The invention, which is Captain Pakenham’s of the&nbsp;roy<sup>r</sup>al navy, has been approved by Admiral Cornwallis,&nbsp;the commiſſioners of the admiralty, by the ſociety in&nbsp;whoſe tranſactions the account of it was firſt publiſhed,&nbsp;and who preſented to Captain Pakenham their gold medal, by the Trinity-houſe, by the managing owners of&nbsp;Eaſt India ſhipping, by the duke of Sudermania the&nbsp;preſent regent of Sweden, and by the ſociety for the&nbsp;improvement of naval architecture. The ſubſtitute here&nbsp;recommended for a loſt rudder, ſays the inventor, is&nbsp;formed of thoſe materials without which no ſhip goes&nbsp;to ſea, and its conſtruction is ſimple and ſpeedy. Captain Pakenham, however, did not give a particular account of his invention to the ſociety whom he addreſſed,&nbsp;and to whom he ſent a model of his invention, till ſuch&nbsp;time as he had an opportunity of reducing the theory&nbsp;he had conceived to practice. On the 7th of July&nbsp;1788, he made this trial with the Merlin of Newfoundland ; and he declares that, during the different, manœuvres of tacking and wearing, he could not diſcover&nbsp;the leaſt variation between the operation of the machine and that of the ſhip’s rudder : ſhe was ſteered&nbsp;with the ſame eaſe by one man, and anſwered the helm&nbsp;in every ſituation fully as quick. Admiral Cornwallis&nbsp;certifies the ſame with reſpect to the Crown of 64 guns,&nbsp;which loſt her rudder on the Kentiſh Knock, when&nbsp;with the ſubſtitute ſhe was ſteered to Portſmouth with&nbsp;the utmoſt eaſe in a heavy gale, and, as the admiral aſ-ſerts, it would have taken her to the Eaſt Indies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The materials and conſtruction are thus deſcribed in the Tranſactions. “ N</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>j</sup></span><span class="font0"> .l. a top-maſt inverted ; the&nbsp;fid-hole to ſiiip the tiller in, and ſecured with hoops&nbsp;from the anchor {locks ; the heel forming the head of&nbsp;the rudder. N<sup>o</sup> 2. The inner half of a jibb-boom. N<sup>o</sup> 3.&nbsp;The outer half of a jibb-boom. N<sup>j</sup> 4. A fiſh: the whole&nbsp;of theſe materials well-bolted together :—in a merchantman her ruff-tree. N<sup>0</sup>5. A cap, with the ſquare part&nbsp;cut out to fit the ſtern-poſt, and acting as a lower gudgeon, ſecured to the ſtern-poſt with hawſers, leading&nbsp;from the bolts of the cap, under the ſhip’s bottom, into the hawſe-holes, and hove well tort. N<sup>j</sup> 6. A plank,&nbsp;or, if none on board the ſhips, gangboards. N<sup>u</sup> 7. An-chor-ſtocks, made to fit the topmaſt as partners, ſecured to the deck, and ſupplying the place of the upper&nbsp;gudgeon, and in a merchant-ſhip the clamps of her wind-laſs. N<sup>o</sup> 8. A ſtern-poſt. N<sup>o</sup> 9. Hoops from the anchor ſtocks. N<sup>o</sup> 10. Pigs of ballaſt, to fink the lower&nbsp;part. The head of the rudder to paſs through as many decks as you wiſh.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On this the Captain makes the following remarks : “ It might probably be ſuppoſed, that a difficulty&nbsp;would occur in bringing the jaws of the cap to embrace&nbsp;the ſtern-poſt ; but this will at once be obviated, when&nbsp;it is remembered that the top-chains, or hawſers, leading from each end of the jaws, under the ſhip’s bottom,&nbsp;are in fact a continuance of the jaws themſelves. Nor&nbsp;can it be apprehended that the cap, when fixed, may be&nbsp;impelled from its ſtation, either by the efforts of the&nbsp;ſea, or the courſe of the ſhip through the water, tho*&nbsp;even the hawſers, which confine it in the firſt inſtance,&nbsp;ſhould be relaxed:—the experiment proves, that the&nbsp;partners muſt be firſt torn away, or the main-piece broken off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Since the improved ſtate of navigation, notwithſtanding· remedies have been found in general for the moſt diſaſtrous accidents at ſea, experience has evinced&nbsp;that nothing complete, had been hitherto invented to&nbsp;ſupply the loſs of a rudder. The firſt expedient within my knowledge were cables veered altern, with tackles&nbsp;leading from them to the ſhip’s quarters. This practice&nbsp;was ſuperſeded by the invention of the machine uſually&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the Ipſwich machine</span><span class="font0"> ; but the conſtruction of it is&nbsp;complex and unwieldy, and veffels are ſeldom found in&nbsp;poſſeſſion of the materials which form it.
