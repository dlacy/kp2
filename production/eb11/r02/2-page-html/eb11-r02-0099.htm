<p><span class="font2">It is surprising that even the reptiles <sup>Λ</sup>ί his native country were most imperfectly known to the author.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With the enlargement of geographical knowledge that of reptiles was also advanced, as is sufficiently apparent from the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Johnston.</span><span class="font2"> I<sup>ar</sup>S<sup>c</sup> encyclopaedic works of Gesner, Aldrovandi and&nbsp;Johnston. The last-named author especially, who&nbsp;published the various portions of his Natural History in&nbsp;the middle of the 17th century, was able to embody in his&nbsp;compilations notices of numerous reptiles observed by Francisco&nbsp;Hernandez in Mexico and by Marcgrave and Piso in Brazil.&nbsp;As the author had no definite idea of the Ray-Linnaean term&nbsp;“ species,” it is not possible to give the exact number of&nbsp;reptiles mentioned in his work. But it may be estimated&nbsp;at about fifty, not including some marine fishes and fabulous&nbsp;creatures. Hc figures (or rather reproduces the figures of)&nbsp;about forty—some species being represented by several figures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Linnaean Period: Formation of a Class Amphibia.—&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Within the century which succeeded these compilatory works&nbsp;(1650-1750) fall the labours which prepared the way&nbsp;for and exerted the greatest influence on Ray and&nbsp;Linnaeus. Although original researches in the field of&nbsp;herpetology were limited in extent and in number, the authors&nbsp;had freed themselves from the purely literary or scholastic&nbsp;tendency. Men were no longer satisfied with reproducing and&nbsp;commenting on the writings of their predecessors; the pen was&nbsp;superseded by the eye, the microscope and the knife, and&nbsp;statements were tested by experiment. This spirit of the&nbsp;age manifested itself, so far as the reptiles are concerned, in&nbsp;Chara’s and Redi’s admirable observations on the viper, in&nbsp;Major’s and Vallisnieri<sup>i</sup>S detailed accounts of the anatomy&nbsp;of the chameleon, in the researches of Jacobaeus into the&nbsp;metamorphoses of the Batrachians and the structure of lizards,&nbsp;in Dufay’s history of the development of the salamander&nbsp;(for Batrachians are invariably associated with reptiles&nbsp;proper); in Tyson’s description of the anatomy of the rattlesnake, &amp;c. The natural history collections formed by institutions and wealthy individuals now contained not merely&nbsp;skins of crocodiles or serpents stuffed and transformed into a&nbsp;shape to correspond with the fabulous descriptions of the&nbsp;ancient dragons, but, with the discovery of alcohol as a means&nbsp;of preserving animals, reptiles entire or dissected were exhibited&nbsp;for study; and no opportunity was lost of obtaining them&nbsp;from travellers or residents in foreign countries. Fossils also&nbsp;were now acknowledged to be remains of animals which had&nbsp;lived before the Flood, and some of them were recognized as</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">those of reptiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The contributions to a positive knowledge of the animal kingdom became so numerous as to render the need of a methodical arrangement of the abundance of new facts more and more&nbsp;pressing. Of the two principal systematic attempts made in&nbsp;this period the first ranks as one of the most remarkable steps&nbsp;of the progress of natural history, whilst the second can only&nbsp;be designated as a signal failure, which ought to have been a&nbsp;warning to all those who in after years classified animals in&nbsp;what is called an, “ artificial system.” As the latter attempt,&nbsp;originating with Klein (1685-1759), did not exercise any further&nbsp;influence on herpetology, it will be sufficient to have merely&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ray</span><span class="font2"> mentioned it. John Ray (1628-1705) had recognized&nbsp;the necessity of introducing exact definitions for the&nbsp;several categories into which the animals had to be divided, and&nbsp;he maintained that these categories ought to bè characterized&nbsp;by the structure of animals, and that all zoological knowledge&nbsp;had to start from the “ species ” as its basis. His definition&nbsp;of reptiles as “ animalia sanguinea pulmone respirantia cor&nbsp;unico tantum ventriculo instructum habentia ovipara ” fixed&nbsp;the class in a manner which was adopted by the naturalists of&nbsp;the succeeding hundred and fifty years. Nevertheless, Ray&nbsp;was not a herpetologist; his knowledge of reptiles is chiefly&nbsp;derived from the researches of others, from whose accounts,&nbsp;however, everything not based upon reliable demonstration is&nbsp;critically excluded. He begins with a chapter treating of frogs&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rana,</span><span class="font2"> with two species), toads </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Bufo</span><span class="font2">, with one species) and&nbsp;tortoises@@<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Tesludo<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font2">  with fourteen species). Thc second group&nbsp;comprises the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertae,</span><span class="font2"> twenty-five in number, and includes the&nbsp;salamander and newts; and the third the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Serpentes,</span><span class="font2"> nine species,&nbsp;among which the limbless lizards are enumerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Except in so far as he made known and briefly characterized a number of reptiles, our knowledge of this class was not&nbsp;advanced by Linnaeus. That he associated in the&nbsp;12th edition cartilaginous and other fishes with the&nbsp;reptiles under the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amphibia N antes</span><span class="font2"> was the&nbsp;result of some misunderstanding of an observation by Garden,&nbsp;and is not to be taken as a premonitory token of the recent&nbsp;discoveries of the relation between Batrachians and fishes.&nbsp;Linnaeus places reptiles, which he calls Amphibia, as the third&nbsp;class of the animal kingdom; he divides the genera thus:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order i. Reptiles.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo</span><span class="font1"> (15 species); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rana</span><span class="font1"> (17 sp.); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Draco</span><span class="font1"> (2 sp.); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lacerta</span><span class="font1"> (48 sp., including 6 Batrachians).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order</span><span class="font2"> 2. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Serpentes.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crotcdus</span><span class="font1"> (5 species); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Boa</span><span class="font1"> (10 sp.); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coluber</span><span class="font1"> (96 sp.); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis</span><span class="font1"> (15 sp.); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbaena (2</span><span class="font1"> sp.); </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Caecilia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(2</span><span class="font1"> sp.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">None of the naturalists who under the direction or influence of Linnaeus visited foreign countries possessed any special&nbsp;knowledge of or predilection for the study of reptiles; all,&nbsp;however, contributed to our acquaintance with tropical forms,&nbsp;or transmitted .well-preserved specimens to the collections at&nbsp;home, so that Gmelin, in the 13th edition of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Systema Naturae,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">was able to enumerate three hundred and seventy-one species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The man who, with the advantage of the Linpaean method, first treated of reptiles Hionographically, was Laurenti. In a&nbsp;small book@@<sup>2</sup> he proposed a new division of these&nbsp;animals, of which some ideas and terms have survived&nbsp;into our times, characterizing the orders, genera and species&nbsp;in a much more precise manner than Linnaeus, giving, for&nbsp;his time, excellent descriptions and figures of the species of&nbsp;his native country. Laurenti might have become for herpetology&nbsp;what Artedi was for ichthyology, but his resources were extremely&nbsp;limited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The circumstance that Chelonians are entirely omitted from his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Synopsis</span><span class="font2"> seems due rather to the main object with which&nbsp;he engaged in the study of herpetology, viz. that of examining&nbsp;and distinguishing reptiles reputed to be poisonous, and to&nbsp;want of material, than to his conviction that tortoises should&nbsp;be relegated to another class. He divides the class into three&nbsp;orders:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salientia, with the genera </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pipa, Bufo, Rana, Hyla,</span><span class="font1"> and one</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">species of “ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Protcus</span><span class="font1">,” viz. the larva of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudis paradoxa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gradientia, the three first genera of which are Tailed Batrach-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ians, viz. two species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proteus</span><span class="font1"> (one being the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">P. anguinus), Triton</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Salamandra ;</span><span class="font1"> followed by true Saurians—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caudiverbera, Gecko, Chamaeleo, Iguana, Basiliscus, Draco,<sub>&nbsp;</sub>Cordylus, Crocodilus, Scincus, Stellio, Seps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Serpentia, among which he continues to keep </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbaena,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caecilia</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis,</span><span class="font1"> but the large Linnaean genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coluber </span><span class="font1">is divided into twelve, chiefly from the Scutellation of the&nbsp;head and form of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work concludes with an account of the experiments made by Laurenti to prove the poisonous or innocuous nature of thosc&nbsp;reptiles of which he could obtain living specimens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The next general work on reptiles is by Lacépède. It appeared in the years 1788 and 1790 under the title </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire&nbsp;naturelle des quadrupèdes ovipares et des serpens</span><span class="font2"> (Paris,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2 vols. 4to). Although as regards treatment of details and amount of information this work far surpasses the&nbsp;modest attempt of Laurenti, it shows no advance towards a&nbsp;more natural division and arrangement of the genera. The&nbsp;author depends entirely on conspicuous external characters,&nbsp;and classifies the reptiles into (1) oviparous quadrupeds with a&nbsp;tail, (2) oviparous quadrupeds without a tail, (3) oviparous</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In associating tortoises with toads, Ray could not disengage&nbsp;himself from the general popular view as to the nature of these&nbsp;animals, which found expression in the German </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schildkrote</span><span class="font1"> (“ Shield-toad ”).</span></p>
