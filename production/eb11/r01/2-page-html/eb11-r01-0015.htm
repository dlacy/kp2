<p><span class="font1">of Ophelia and the remorse of Lady Macbeth, but beside the sincerer if less perfectly expressed passion of Corneille’s Cléopâtre&nbsp;and Camille. In men’s parts he fails still more completely.&nbsp;As the decency of his stage would not allow him to make his&nbsp;heroes frankly heroic, so it would not allow him to make them&nbsp;utterly passionate. He had, moreover, cut away from himself,&nbsp;by the adoption of the Senecan model, all the opportunities&nbsp;which would have been offered to his remarkably varied talent&nbsp;on a freer stage. It is indeed tolerably certain that he never&nbsp;could have achieved the purely poetical comedy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">As</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">You Like&nbsp;It</span><span class="font1"> or the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vida es Sueño,</span><span class="font1"> but the admirable success of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Plaideurs&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">makes it at least probable that he might have done something&nbsp;in a lower and a more conventional style. From all this,&nbsp;however, he deliberately cut himself off. Of the whole world&nbsp;which is subject to the poet he took only a narrow artificial and&nbsp;conventional fraction. Within these narrow bounds he did work&nbsp;which no admirer of literary craftsmanship can regard without&nbsp;admiration. It would be unnecessary to contrast his performances with his limitations so sharply if those limitations&nbsp;had not been denied. But they have been and arc still denied&nbsp;by persons whose sentence carries weight, and therefore it is&nbsp;still necessary to point out the fact of their existence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibliography. —Nearly all Racine’s works are mentioned in the above notice. There is here no room for a bibliographical&nbsp;account of their separate appearances. The first collected edition&nbsp;was in 1675-76, and contained the nine tragedies which had then&nbsp;appeared. The last and most complete which appeared in the&nbsp;poet's lifetime (1697) was perhaps revised by him, and contains&nbsp;the dramas and a few miscellaneous works. Like the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">editio princeps,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">it is in 2 vols. 12mo. The posthumous editions are innumerable&nbsp;and gradually became more and more complete. The most&nbsp;noteworthy are the Amsterdam edition of 1722; that by Abbé&nbsp;d’Olivet, also at Amsterdam, 1743; the Paris quarto of 1760;&nbsp;the edition of Luneau de Boisjermain, Paris and London, 1768;&nbsp;the magnificent illustrated folios of 1805 (Paris); the edition of&nbsp;Germain Gamier with La Harpe’s commentary, 1807; Geoffroy’s&nbsp;of the next year; Aimé Martin’s of 1820; and lastly, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grands&nbsp;écrivains</span><span class="font0"> edition of Paul Mesnard (Paris, 1865-73). This last&nbsp;contains almost all that is necessary for the study of the poet, and&nbsp;has been chiefly used in preparing the above notice. Louis Racine’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font0"> was first published in 1747. Translations and imitations of&nbsp;Racine are innumerable, ln English the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Distressed Mother</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Ambrose Philips and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phaedra and Hippolytus</span><span class="font0"> of Edmund&nbsp;Smith (1672-1710), both composed more or less under Addison’s&nbsp;influence, are the most noteworthy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As for criticism on him, a bibliography of it would be nearly a bibliography of French critical literature. The chief recent instance&nbsp;of substantive work is G. Larroumet’s monograph in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Grands&nbsp;écrivains français</span><span class="font0"> (1898), but F. Brunetière, Émile Faguet, and other&nbsp;critics have constantly and in various ways endeavoured to apply&nbsp;the general reaction from Romanticism to a semi-classical attitude&nbsp;to this greatest of French </span><span class="font1">“</span><span class="font0"> classics. ” The conclusions «above given&nbsp;remain unaffected by this temporary set of opinion. Racine will&nbsp;never be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">enfoncé—</span><span class="font0">“ put to rout ”—as the extravagant Romantics&nbsp;thought him to be for a time. But, on the other hand, his limita-tions will remain, and no ingenious but arbitrary and extemporized&nbsp;theories of drama as to “ conflicts of will ” and the like can suffice&nbsp;to veil his defect in universality, his comparative shallowness, and&nbsp;his inadequate appreciation, or at least representation, of the rich-ness, the intricacy and the unconventionality of nature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RACINE, LOUIS (1692-1763), French poet, second son of Jean Racine, was born in Paris on the 6th of November 1692.&nbsp;Early conscious of a vocation for poetry, he had been dissuaded&nbsp;from following his inclination by Boileau on the ground that the&nbsp;gift never existed in two successive generations. In 1722 his&nbsp;small means induced him to accept a position in the revenue in&nbsp;Provence, but a marriage with a certain Mademoiselle Presle&nbsp;secured his independence. In 1 755 he lost his son in the disasters&nbsp;consequent on the Lisbon earthquake. This misfortune,&nbsp;commemorated by Écouchard Lebrun, broke Racine’s spirit.&nbsp;He sold his library, and gave himself up entirely to the practice&nbsp;of religion. In 1719 he had become a member of the Académie&nbsp;des Inscriptions, but had never offered himself as a member of&nbsp;the Académie Française, for fear, it is said, of incurring refusal&nbsp;on account of bis Jansenist opinions. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Grace</span><span class="font1"> (1720) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Religion</span><span class="font1"> (1742), his most important work, are inspired by a&nbsp;sincere piety, and are written in verse of uniform clearness and&nbsp;excellence. His other works include epistles, odes, among which&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ode sur l'harmonie</span><span class="font1"> (1736) should be mentioned, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1747) of Jean Racine, and a prose translation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paradise Lost&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1755). Louis Racine died on the 29th of January 1763. He&nbsp;was characterized by Voltaire as “le bon versificateur Racine,&nbsp;fils du grand poète Racine. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Œuvres complètes</span><span class="font0"> were collected (6 vols. ) in 1808.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RACINE, a city and the county-seat of Racine county, Wisconsin, U. S. A., on the W. shore of Lake Michigan at the&nbsp;mouth of the Root river, about 25 m. S. S. E. of Milwaukee and&nbsp;about 60 m. N. of Chicago. Pop. (1890) 21,014; (1900)&nbsp;29, 102, of whom 9242 were foreign-born; (1910 census)&nbsp;38,002. Racine is served by the Chicago &amp; North Western&nbsp;and the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul railways, by two inter-urban electric railways, connecting with Milwaukee and Chicago,&nbsp;and by steamboat lines. The river has been deepened and its&nbsp;mouth protected by breakwaters, providing an excellent&nbsp;harbour; in 1909 vessels drawing 19 ft. could pass through the&nbsp;channel. Among the public buildings are the City Hall, the&nbsp;County Court House, the Federal Building, the Carnegie&nbsp;Library, the High School, two hospitals and the Taylor&nbsp;Orphan Asylum (1872). Among educational institutions,&nbsp;besides the public schools, are Racine College (Protestant&nbsp;Episcopal, 1853), St Catherine’s Academy (Roman Catholic)&nbsp;and two business colleges. Racine is, next to Milwaukee, the&nbsp;most important manufacturing centre in Wisconsin. The&nbsp;value of its factory products in 1903 was $16,458,965, an increase&nbsp;of 41% over that of 1900. Of this, $5,177,079 (or 31∙5% of&nbsp;the city’s total) represented agricultural implements and&nbsp;machinery. Carriages and wagons ($2,729,311) and automobiles&nbsp;ranked next in importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Racine was the French form of the name of the Root river. The first Europeans positively known to have visited the site&nbsp;of Racine were Vincennes, Tonty and several Jesuit missionaries,&nbsp;who stopped here for a time on their way down the coast in&nbsp;1699. Early in the 19th century Jambeau, a French trader,&nbsp;established himself on the Root river, and in 1834 Gilbert&nbsp;Knapp (1798-1889), who had been a lake captain since 1818,&nbsp;induced several residents of Chicago to make their homes at&nbsp;its mouth. The place was at first called Port Gilbert. The&nbsp;settlement grew rapidly, a sawmill was built in 1835, and the&nbsp;present name was adopted in 1837. In 1841 Racine was&nbsp;incorporated as a village and in 1848 was chartered as a city.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RACK, an homonymous word of which the principal branches are the words meaning (1) a mass of cloud driving&nbsp;before the wind in the upper air, (2) to draw off wine or other&nbsp;liquor from the lees, (3) a bar or framework of bars, (4) an&nbsp;instrument of torture. The etymology of (1) shows that it is&nbsp;ultimately to be connected with “ wreck ” and “ wrack, ”&nbsp;drifted seaweed, and means that which is driven by or drifts&nbsp;with the wind; cf. Norw. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rak,</span><span class="font1"> wreckage, refuse, Icel. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reka,</span><span class="font1"> to&nbsp;drive, toss. In (2) the term seems to have come from the&nbsp;Gascon wine-trade, as Skeat (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Etym. Dict.,</span><span class="font1"> 1910) points out,&nbsp;and was adapted from Prov. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arracar,</span><span class="font1"> to decant wine, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raca,</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;stems and husks of grapes, dregs. Both (2) and (3) are in&nbsp;origin to be connected. The O. E. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reccan</span><span class="font1"> and Ger. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">recken&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">mean “ to stretch, ” and so “ rack ” means something stretched&nbsp;out, a straight bar or rail, especially a toothed bar gearing&nbsp;with a cog-wheel, a framework of bars, as in the cradle of&nbsp;upright bars in which fodder can be placed for cattle, and&nbsp;the instrument of torture, which in Ger. is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Recke</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rackbank.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The “ rack ” for torture was an oblong frame of wood, slightly&nbsp;raised from the ground, having at one end a fixed bar to which&nbsp;the legs were fastened, and at the other a movable bar to&nbsp;which the hands were tied. By means of pulleys and levers&nbsp;this latter could be rolled on its own axis, thus straining the&nbsp;ropes till the sufferer’s joints were dislocated. Its first employment in England is said to have been due to John Holland,&nbsp;4th duke of Exeter, constable of the Tower in 1447, whence&nbsp;it was popularly known as “ the Duke of Exeter’s daughter. ”</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
