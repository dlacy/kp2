The word <hi rend="italic">saṃskṛita</hi> is the past participle of the verb <hi rend="italic">kar</hi> (<hi rend="italic">kṛ</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> “ to make ” (cognate with Latin <hi rend="italic">creo</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> with the preposition <hi rend="italic">sam,</hi> “ together ” (cog. <hi rend="italic">άμα, δμfc,</hi> Eng. “ same ”), and has probably to be taken here in the sense of “ completely formed ” or “ accurately made, polished, refined ’’—some noun meaning “ speech ” (esp. <hi rend="italic">bhāshā</hi>) being either expressed or understood with it. The term was, doubtless, originally adopted by native grammarians to distinguish the literary language from the uncultivated popular dialects—the forerunners of the modern vernaculars of northern India—which had developed side by side with it, and which were called (from the same root <hi rend="italic">kar,</hi> but with a different preposition) <hi rend="italic">PräkrUa, i.e.</hi> either “ derived ” or “ natural, common ” forms of speech. This designation of the literary idiom, being intended to imply a language regulated by conventional rules, also involves a distinction between the grammatically fixed language of Brāhmanical India and an earlier, less settled, phase of the same language exhibited in the Vedic writings. For convenience the Vedic language is, however, usually included in the term, and scholars generally distinguish between the Vedic and the classical Sanskrit.</p><p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanskrit Language</hi></p><p>The Sanskrit language, with its old and modern descendants, represents the easternmost branch of the great Indo-Germanic, or Aryan, stock of speech. Philological research has clearly established the fact that the Indo-Aryans must originally have immigrated into India from the north-west. In the oldest literary documents handed down by them their gradual advance can indeed be traced from the slopes of eastern Kabulistan down to the land of the five rivers (Punjab), and thence to the plains of the Yamunā (Jumna) and Gangä (Ganges). Numerous special coincidences, both of language and mythology, between the Vedic Aryans and the peoples of Iran also show that these two members of the Indo-Germanic family must have remained in close connexion for some considerable period after the others had separated from them.</p><p>The origin of comparative philology dates from the time when European scholars became accurately acquainted with the ancient language of India. Before that time classical scholars had been unable to determine the true relations between the then known languages of our stock. This fact alone shows the importance of Sanskrit for comparative research. Though its value in this respect has perhaps at times been overrated, it may still be considered the eldest daughter of the old mother-tongue. Indeed, so far as direct documentary evidence goes, it may be said to be the only surviving daughter; for none of the other six principal members of the family have left any literary monuments, and their original features have to be reproduced, as best they can, from the materials supplied by their own daughter languages: such is the case as regards the Iranic, Hellenic, Italic, Celtic, Teutonic and Letto-Slavic languages. To the Sanskrit the antiquity and extent of its literary docu-ments, the transparency of its grammatical structure, the comparatively primitive state of its accent system, and the thorough grammatical treatment it has early received at the hand of native scholars must ever secure the foremost place in the comparative study of Indo-Germanic speech.</p><p>The Sanskrit alphabet consists of the following sounds:—</p><p>(<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) Fourteen vowels, viz:</p><p>Ten simple vowels: <hi rend="italic">a, ā, i, ī, u, ū, ṛ, ṝ, ḷ (ḹ)</hi>; and Four diphthongs : <hi rend="italic">ē, āi, ō, āu.</hi></p><p>(<hi rend="italic">b</hi>) Thirty-three consonants, viz. :</p><p>Five series of mutes and nasals:</p><p>guttural : <hi rend="italic">k kh g gh ṅ</hi></p><p>palatal: <hi rend="italic">c ch j jh ñ</hi> lingual : <hi rend="italic">ṭ ṭh ḍ ḍh ṇ</hi> dental : <hi rend="italic">t th d dh n</hi> labial: <hi rend="italic">p ph b bh m;</hi></p><p>Four semivowels : <hi rend="italic">y r l v</hi> (<hi rend="italic">w</hi>)</p><p>Three sibilants: palatal ś (ç), lingual <hi rend="italic">ṣ</hi> (<hi rend="italic">sh</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> dental <hi rend="italic">s</hi>; and A soft aspirate: <hi rend="italic">h</hi>.</p><p>(c) Three unoriginal sounds, viz.</p><p><hi rend="italic">visarga</hi> (ḥ), a hard aspirate, standing mostly for original</p><p><hi rend="italic">s</hi> or <hi rend="italic">r</hi>; and two nasal sounds of less close contact than the mute-nasals, viz. <hi rend="italic">anusvāra</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ṃ</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">anunāsika</hi> (ṁ) <hi rend="italic">.</hi></p><p>As regards the vowels, a prominent feature of the language is the prevalence of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-sounds, these being about twice as frequent as all the others, including diphthongs taken together (Whitney).</p><p>The absence of the short vowels <hi rend="italic">ĕ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ŏ</hi> from the Sanskrit alphabet, and the fact that Sanskrit shows the <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-vowel where other vowels appear in other languages— <hi rend="italic">e.g. bharantam ≈ φtpοvτα, ferentem; janas =</hi> γevos, <hi rend="italic">genus—</hi> were formerly considered as strong evidence in favour of the more primitive state of the Sanskrit vowel system as compared with that of the sister languages. Recent research has, however, shown pretty conclusively from certain indications in the Sanskrit language itself that the latter must at one time have possessed the same, or very nearly the same, three vowel-sounds, and that the differentiation of the original <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-sound must, therefore, have taken place before the separation of the languages. Thus, Sans. <hi rend="italic">carati,</hi> he walks, would seem to require an original <hi rend="italic">kĕrĕti</hi> (Gr. πέλα = <hi rend="italic">queleti,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">colit),</hi> as otherwise the guttural <hi rend="italic">k</hi> could not have changed to the palatal <hi rend="italic">c</hi> (see below) ; and similarly Sans. <hi rend="italic">jānu,</hi> knee, seems to stand for <hi rend="italic">gēnu</hi> (Lat. <hi rend="italic">genu,</hi> Gr. <hi rend="italic">yòvv</hi>) <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Not impossibly, however, this prevalence of pure <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-sounds in Sanskrit may from the very beginning have been a mere theoretical or graphic feature of the language, the difference of pronunciation having not yet been pronounced enough for the early grammarians to have felt it necessary to clearly distinguish between the different shades of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-sounds.</p><p>The vowels <hi rend="italic">ē</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ō,</hi> though apparently simple sounds, are classed as diphthongs, being contracted from original <hi rend="italic">äi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">äu</hi> respectively, and liable to be treated as such in the phonetic modifications they have to undergo before any vowel except <hi rend="italic">ä.</hi></p><p>As regards the consonants, two of the five series of mutes, the palatal and lingual series, are of secondary (the one of Indo-Iranian, the other of purely lndian) growth.</p><p>' The palatals are, as a rule, derived from original gutturals, the modification being generally due to the influence of a neighbouring palatal sound <hi rend="italic">i</hi> or <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ĕ</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ä</hi>). The surd aspirate <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> in words of Indo-Germanic origin, almost invariably goes back to original <hi rend="italic">sk: e.g. chid-</hi> (<hi rend="italic">chind-</hi>) = <hi rend="italic">scindo, σχίζω: chāyā</hi> = σκιά (O.E. <hi rend="italic">sein,</hi> shine); Sans. <hi rend="italic">gacchati = βάσκοl.</hi></p><p>The palatal sibilant ś (pronounced <hi rend="italic">sh</hi>) likewise originated from a guttural mute <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> but one of somewhat different phonetic value from that represented by Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">k</hi> or <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. The latter, usually designated by <hi rend="italic">k</hi> <hi rend="sup">2</hi> <hi rend="italic">(or q),</hi> is frequently liable to labialization (or dentalization) in Greek, probably owing to an original pronunciation <hi rend="italic">kw</hi> (<hi rend="italic">qu</hi>): <hi rend="italic">e.g. katara = πbτepos, uter∙,</hi> while the former (<hi rend="italic">k</hi> <hi rend="sup">1</hi>) shows invariably <hi rend="italic">k</hi> in Greek, and a sibilant in the Letto-Slavic and the Indo-Iranian languages: <hi rend="italic">e.g. śvan</hi> (<hi rend="italic">śun</hi>) <hi rend="italic">= κbωv</hi> (<hi rend="italic">κvv</hi>) <hi rend="italic">, canis,</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic">Hund; daśan = δtκa, decem,</hi> Goth. <hi rend="italic">taihun.</hi></p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0157" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0174.jp2"/><p>The non-original nature of the palatals betrays itself even in Sanskrit by their inability to occur at the end of a word— <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> acc. <hi rend="italic">vācam</hi> = Lat. <hi rend="italic">vocem,</hi> but nom. <hi rend="italic">vāk = vox—</hi> and by otherwise frequently reverting to the guttural state.</p><p>The linguals differ in pronunciation from the dentals in their being uttered with the tip of the tongue turned up to the dome of the palate, while in the utterance of the dentals it is pressed against the upper teeth, not against the upper gums as is done in the English dentals, which to Hindus sound more like their own linguals. The latter, when occurring in words of Aryan origin, are, as a rule, modifications of original dentals, usually accompanied by the loss of an <hi rend="italic">r</hi> or other adjoining consonant; but more commonly they occur in words of foreign, probably non-Aryan, origin. Of regular occurrence in the language, however, is the change of dental <hi rend="italic">n</hi> into lingual <hi rend="italic">ṇ</hi>, and of dental <hi rend="italic">s</hi> into lingual when preceded in the same word by certain other letters. The combination <hi rend="italic">kṣ</hi> seems sometimes to stand for <hi rend="italic">ks (? kst)</hi> as in Sans. <hi rend="italic">akṣa,</hi> Gr. aξωμ, axle; Sans. <hi rend="italic">dakshiṇa,</hi> Gr. Ôé£ios (but Lat. <hi rend="italic">dexter</hi>); sometimes for <hi rend="italic">kt, e.g.</hi> Sans. <hi rend="italic">kshiti, Gr. κτίσυs</hi> (but Sans. <hi rend="italic">kshiti = Gτ. φθισts</hi>); Sans. <hi rend="italic">takshan,</hi> Gr. τeκrωp.</p><p>The sonant aspirate <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is Iìkewise non-original, being usually derived from original sonant aspirated mutes, especially <hi rend="italic">gh, e.g. haṃsa = χhv</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">χavs</hi>) <hi rend="italic">, anser,</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic">Gans</hi>; <hi rend="italic">aham = eywv, ego,</hi> Goth, <hi rend="italic">ik.</hi></p><p>The contact of final and initial letters of words in the same sentence . is often attended in Sanskrit with considerable euphonic modifications; and we have no means of knowing how far the practice of the vernacular language may have corresponded to these phonetic theories. There can be no doubt, however, that a good deal in this respect has to be placed to the account of grammatical reflection; and the very facilities which the primitive structure of the language offered for grammatical analysis and an insight into the principles of internal modification may have given</p><p>the first impulse to external modifications of a similar kind.</p><p>None of the cognate languages exhibits in so transparent a manner as the Sanskrit the cardinal principle of Indo-Germanic word-formation by the addition of inflectional endings—either case-endings or personal terminations (themselves probably original roots)— to stems obtained, mainly by means of suffixes, from monosyllabic roots, with or without internal modifications.</p><p>There are in Sanskrit declension three numbers and seven cases, not counting the vocative, viz. nominative, accusative, instrumental (or sociative), dative, ablative, genitive and locative. As a matter of fact, all these seven cases appear, however, only in the singular of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-stems and of the pronominal declension. Other noun-stems have only one case-form for the ablative and genitive singular. In the plural, the ablative everywhere shares its form with the dative (except in the personal pronoun, where it has the same ending as in the singular), whilst the dual shows only three different case-forms—one for the nominative and accusative, another for the instrumental, dative,</p><p>and ablative, and a third for the genitive and locative.</p><p>The declension of <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-stems corresponding to the first and second Latin declensions is of especial interest, not so much on account of its being predominant from the earliest time, and becoming more and more so with the development of the language, but because it presents the greatest number of alternative forms, which supply a kind of test for determining the age of literary productions, a test which indeed has already been applied to some extent by Professor Lanman, in his excellent <hi rend="italic">Statistical Account of Noun Inflexion in the Veda.</hi> These alternative case-forms are :—</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> <hi rend="italic">sas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ās</hi> for the nominative plural masc. and fern.: <hi rend="italic">e.g. aśvāsas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">aśvās = equi</hi> (<hi rend="italic">equae</hi>) <hi rend="italic">.</hi> The forms in <hi rend="italic">āsas</hi> —explained by Bopp as the sign of the plural <hi rend="italic">as</hi> applied twice, and by Schleicher as the sign of the plural <hi rend="italic">as</hi> added to the nominative singular— occur to those in <hi rend="italic">ās (i.e.</hi> the ordinary plural sign <hi rend="italic">as</hi> added to the <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-stem) in the Rigveda in the proportion of 1 to 2, and in the peculiar parts of the Atharvaveda in that of 1 to 25, whilst the ending <hi rend="italic">as</hi> alone remains in the later language.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">āni</hi> for the nominative and accusative plural of neuters : as <hi rend="italic">yugā, yugāni = ζvyh, juga.</hi> The proportion of the former ending to the latter in the Rik is 11 to 7, in the Atharvan 2 to 3, whilst the classical Sanskrit knows only the second form.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">ēbhis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">āis</hi> for the instrumental plural masc. and neuter, <hi rend="italic">e.g. devēbhis, devāis.</hi> In the Ṛik the former forms are to the latter in the proportion of 5 to 6, in the Atharvan of 1 to 5, while in the later language only the contracted form is used. The same contraction is found in other languages; but it is doubtful whether it did not originate independently in them.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">āu</hi> for the nominative and accusative dual masc., <hi rend="italic">e.g. ubhā, ubhāu = δμφω.</hi> In the Ṛik forms in <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> outnumber those in <hi rend="italic">āu</hi> more than eight times; whilst in the Atharvan, on the contrary, those in <hi rend="italic">āu</hi> (the only ending used in the classical language) occur five times as often as those in <hi rend="italic">ā.</hi></p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ena</hi> (<hi rend="italic">enā</hi>) for the instrumental singular masc. and neut., as <hi rend="italic">dānā, dānena = dono.</hi> The ending <hi rend="italic">ena</hi> is the one invariably used in the later language. It is likewise the usual form in the Veda; but in a number of cases it shows a final long vowel which, though it may be entirely due to metrical requirements, is more probably a relic of the normal instrumental ending <hi rend="italic">ā,</hi> preserved for prosodic reasons. For the simple ending <hi rend="italic">ā,</hi> as compared with that in <hi rend="italic">ena,</hi> Professor Lanman makes out a proportion of about 1 to 9 in the</p><p>Rigveda (altogether 114 cases); while in the peculiar parts of the Atharvan he finds only 11 cases.</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">ām and ānām</hi> for the genitive plural, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> (<hi rend="italic">aśvām</hi>) <hi rend="italic">, aśvānām = hττ(<hi rend="sub">i</hi>)v, equum</hi> (<hi rend="italic">equorum</hi>) <hi rend="italic">.</hi> The form with inserted nasal (doubtless for <hi rend="italic">anām,</hi> as in Zend <hi rend="italic">aśpanām</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> which is exclusively used in the later language, is also the prevailing one in the Ṛik. There are, however, a few genitives of α-stems in original <hi rend="italic">ām</hi> (for <hi rend="italic">a-ām</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> which also appear in Zend, Professor Lanman enumerating a dozen instances, some of which are, however, doubtful, white others are merely conjectural.</p><p>The Sanskrit verb system resembles that of the Greek in variety and completeness. While the Greek excels in nicety and definiteness of modal distinction, the Sanskrit surpasses it in primitiveness and transparency of formation. In this part of the grammatical system there is, however, an even greater difference than in the noun inflection between the Vedic and the classical Sanskrit. While the former shows, upon the whole, the full complement of modal forms exhibited by the Greek, the later language has practically discarded the subjunctive mood. The Indo-Aryans never succeeded in working out a clear formative distinction between the subjunctive and indicative moods; and, their syntactic requirements becoming more and more limited, they at last contented themselves, for modal expression, with a present optative and imperative, in addition to the indicative tense-forms, and a little-used aorist optative with a special “ precative ” or “ benedictive ” meaning attached to it.</p><p>Another part of the verb in which the later language differs widely from Vedic usage is the infinitive. The language of the old hymns shows a considerable variety of case-forms of verbal abstract nouns with the function of infinitives, a certain number of which can still be traced back to the parent language, as, for instance, such dative forms as <hi rend="italic">jīv-áse</hi> = viv-ere; <hi rend="italic">sáh-adhyăi = eχcσQai; dā'-mane = bóµevai; dā'-υane = bοvvaι.</hi> Further, <hi rend="italic">ji-shé,</hi> “to conquer,” for <hi rend="italic">ji-sé,</hi> apparently an aorist infinitive with the dative ending (parallel to the radical forms, such as <hi rend="italic">yudh-é,</hi> “ to fight,” <hi rend="italic">drs'-é,"</hi> to see ”), thus corresponding to the Greek aorist infinitive λυσαt (but cf. also Latin <hi rend="italic">da-re,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">dase, es-se,</hi> &amp;amp;c.). The classical Sanskrit, on the other hand, practically uses only one infinitive form, viz. the accusative of a verbal noun in <hi rend="italic">tu, e.g. sthātum, etum,</hi> corresponding to the Latin supinum <hi rend="italic">datum, itum.</hi> But, as in Latin another case, the ablative (<hi rend="italic">datū</hi>), of the same abstract noun is utilized for a similar purpose, so the Vedic language makes two other cases do duty as infinitives, viz. the dative in <hi rend="italic">taυe</hi> (<hi rend="italic">e.g. datave,</hi> and the anomalous <hi rend="italic">étavāi)</hi> and the gen.-abl. in <hi rend="italic">tos</hi> (<hi rend="italic">dátos</hi>) <hi rend="italic">.</hi> A prominent feature of the later Sanskrit syntax is the so-called gerund or indeclinable participle in <hi rend="italic">tυa,</hi> apparently the instrumental of a stem in <hi rend="italic">tvā</hi> (probably a derivative from that in <hi rend="italic">tu</hi>), as well as the gerund in <hi rend="italic">ya</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">tya</hi> after a final short radical vowel) made from compound verbs. The old language knows not only such gerunds in <hi rend="italic">tυa,</hi> using them, however, very sparingly, but also corresponding dative forms in <hi rend="italic">tvāya</hi> (<hi rend="italic">yuktvāya</hi>) and the curious contracted forms in <hi rend="italic">tvī'</hi> (<hi rend="italic">kṛtvī</hi>, “ to do ”). And, besides those in <hi rend="italic">ya</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tya,</hi> it frequently uses forms with a final long, vowel, as <hi rend="italic">bhid-yā, i-tyā,</hi> thus showing the former to be shortened instrumentals of abstract nouns in <hi rend="italic">i</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ti.</hi></p><p>The Sanskrit verb, like the Greek, has two voices, active and middle, called, after their primary functions, <hi rend="italic">parasmāi-pada,</hi> “ word for another," and <hi rend="italic">ātmane-pada,</hi> "word for one’s self.” While in Greek the middle forms have to do duty also for the passive in all tenses except the aorist and future, the Sanskrit, on the other hand, has developed for the passive a special present-stem in <hi rend="italic">ya,</hi> the other tenses being supplied by the corresponding middle forms, with the exception of the third person singular aorist, for which a special form in <hi rend="italic">i</hi> is usually assigned to the passive.</p><p>The present-stem system is by far the most important part of the whole verb system, both on account of frequency of actual occur-rence and of its excellent state of preservation. It is with regard to the different ways of present-stem formation that the entire stock of assumed roots has been grouped by the native grammarians under ten different classes. These classes again naturally fall under two divisions or “ conjugations,” with this characteristic difference that the one (corresponding to Gr. conj. in ω) retains the same stem (ending in <hi rend="italic">a}</hi> throughout the present and imperfect, only lengthening the final vowel before terminations beginning with <hi rend="italic">v</hi> or <hi rend="italic">m</hi> (not final) ; while the other (corresponding to that in <hi rend="italic">µi</hi>) shows two different forms of the stem, a strong and a weak form, according as the accent falls on the stem-syllable or on the personal ending: <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> 3 sing, <hi rend="italic">bhára-ti, φeρei</hi> —2 pl. <hi rend="italic">bhára-tha, φepeτe</hi>: but <hi rend="italic">é-ti, eiσι —i-thá, iTe</hi> (for iTe): Ising. <hi rend="italic">stṛṇó-mi, στδpwμι—</hi> 1 pl. <hi rend="italic">stṛṇu-más</hi> (στ0ρwμes).</p><p>As several of the personal endings show a decided similarity to personal or demonstrative pronouns, it is highly probable that, as might indeed be a priori expected, all or most of them are of pronominal origin—though, owing to their exposed position and consequent decay, their original form and identity cannot now be determined with certainty. The active singular terminations, with the exception of the second person of the imperative, are unaccented and of comparatively light appearance; while those of the dual and plural, as well as the middle terminations, have the accent, being apparently too heavy to be supported by the stem-accent, either because, as Schleicher supposed, they are composed of two</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0158" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0175.jp2"/><p>different pronominal elements, or otherwise. The treatment of the personal endings in the modifying, and presumably older, conjugation may thus be said somewhat to resemble that of enclitics in Greek.</p><p>In the imperfect the present-stem is increased by the augment, consisting of a prefixed <hi rend="italic">ă.</hi> Here, as in the other tenses in which it appears, it has invariably the accent, as being the distinctive element (originally probably an independent demonstrative adverb “ then ”) for the expression of past time. This shifting of the word-accent seems to have contributed to the further reduction of the personal endings, and thus to have caused the formation of a new, or secondary, set of terminations which came to be appropriated for secondary tenses and moods generally. As in Greek poetry, the augment is frequently omitted in Sanskrit.</p><p>The mood-sign of the subjunctive is <hi rend="italic">ă</hi>, added to (the strong form of) the tense-stem. If the stem ends already in <hi rend="italic">ă</hi>, the latter becomes lengthened. As regards the personal terminations, some persons take the primary, others the secondary forms, while others again may take either the one or the other. The first singular active, however, takes <hi rend="italic">ni</hi> instead of <hi rend="italic">mi,</hi> to distinguish it from the indicative. But besides these forms, showing the mood-sign <hi rend="italic">ă</hi>, the subjunctive (both present and aorist) may take another form, without any distinctive modal sign, and with the secondary endings, being thus identical with the augmentless form of the preterite.</p><p>The optative invariably takes the secondary endings, with some peculiar variations. In the active of the modifying conjugation its mood-sign is yā, affixed to the weak form of the stem: <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> root <hi rend="italic">as— syām = Lat. siem, sīm</hi> (where Gr., from analogy to <hi rend="italic">iσrl,</hi> &amp;amp;c., shows irregularly the strong form of the stem, <hi rend="italic">tlιμv,</hi> for ίσ-ιη-ρ: as in 1st sing. of verbs in ω, it also has irregularly the primary ending, λebroijuI = S. <hi rend="italic">rece-y-am</hi>); while in the <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-conjugation and throughout the middle the mood-sign is <hi rend="italic">ī,</hi> probably a contraction of <hi rend="italic">yā</hi>: <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">=φtfK&amp;gt;LS.</hi></p><p>Besides the ordinary perfect, made from a reduplicated stem, with distinction between strong (active singular) and weak forms, and a partly peculiar set of endings, the later language makes large use of a periphrastic perfect, consisting of the accusative of a feminine abstract noun in <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> (<hi rend="italic">-ām</hi>) with the reduplicated perfect forms of the auxiliary verbs <hi rend="italic">kar,</hi> “ to do,” or <hi rend="italic">as</hi> (and occasionally <hi rend="italic">bhū),</hi> "to be.” Though more particularly resorted to for the derivative forms of conjugation—viz. the causative (including the so-called tenth conjugational class), the desiderative, intensive and denominative—this perfect-form is also commonly used with roots beginning with prosodically long vowels, as well as with a few other isolated roots. In the Rigveda this formation is quite unknown, and the Atharvan offers a single instance of it, from a causative verb, with the auxiliary <hi rend="italic">kar.</hi> In the Vedic prose, on the other hand, it is rather frequent,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> It also shows occasionally other tense-forms than the perfect of the same periphrastic formation with <hi rend="italic">kar.</hi> </note> and it is quite common in the later language.</p><p>In «addition to the ordinary participles, active and middle, of the reduplicated perfect— <hi rend="italic">e.g. jajan-vάn, yeyov-ws</hi>: <hi rend="italic">bubudh-āná,</hi> TcTw-µéï'o—there is a secondary participial formation, obtained by affixing the possessive suffix <hi rend="italic">vat</hi> (<hi rend="italic">vant</hi>) to the passive past participle: <hi rend="italic">e.g. krta-vant,</hi> lit. “ having (that which is) done.” A secondary participle of this kind occurs once in the Atharvaveda, and it is occasionally met with in the Brāhmaṇas. In the later language, however, it not only is of rather frequent occurrence, but has assumed quite a new function, viz. that of a finite perfect-form; thus <hi rend="italic">krtavān, krtavantas,</hi> without any auxiliary verb, mean, not “ having done,” but “ he has done,” “ they have done.”</p><p>The original Indo-Germanie future-stem formation in <hi rend="italic">sya,</hi> with primary endings— <hi rend="italic">e.g. dāsyáti = δωfii</hi> (for δωσeτι)—is the ordinary tense-form both in Vedic and classical Sanskrit—a preterite of it, with a conditional force attached to it (<hi rend="italic">ádāsyal</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> being also common to all periods of the language.</p><p>Side by side with this future, however, an analytic tense-form makes its appearance in the Brāhmaṇas, obtaining wider currency in the later language. This periphrastic future is made by means of the nominative singular of a <hi rend="italic">nomen agentis</hi> in <hi rend="italic">tar</hi> (<hi rend="italic">dātar,</hi> nom. <hi rend="italic">dātā</hi> = Lat. <hi rend="italic">dator),</hi> followed by the corresponding present forms of <hi rend="italic">as,</hi> “ to be ” (<hi rend="italic">dātā-'smi,</hi> as it were, <hi rend="italic">daturus sum),</hi> with the exception of the third persons, which need no auxiliary, but take the respective nominatives of the noun.</p><p>The aorist system is somewhat complicated, including as it does augment-preterites of various formations, viz. a radical aorist, sometimes with reduplicated stem— <hi rend="italic">e.g. ásthām = eστηv</hi>: <hi rend="italic">śrudhí =</hi> κλD0ι; <hi rend="italic">ádudrot</hi>; an <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-aorist (or thematic aorist) with or without reduplication— <hi rend="italic">e.g. áricas = eyιπts</hi>: <hi rend="italic">ápaptam,</hi> cf. <hi rend="italic">lπtφvw</hi>; and several different forms of a sibilant-aorist. In the older Vedic language the radical aorist is far more common than the <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-aorist, which Becomes more frequently used later on. Of the different kinds of sibilant-aorists, the most common is the one which makes its stem by the addition of <hi rend="italic">s</hi> to the root, either with or without a connecting vowel <hi rend="italic">i</hi> in different roots: <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> root <hi rend="italic">ji—</hi> I sing, <hi rend="italic">ájāisham,</hi> I pl. <hi rend="italic">ájāishma</hi>; <hi rend="italic">ákramisham, ákramishma.</hi> A limited number of roots take a double aorist-sign with inserted connecting vowel (<hi rend="italic">sish</hi> for <hi rend="italic">sis)—e.g. áyāsisham</hi> (cf. <hi rend="italic">scrip-sis-ti</hi>); whilst others—very rarely</p><p>in the older but more numerously in the later language—make their aorist-stem by the addition of <hi rend="italic">sa—e.g. ádikshas</hi> = eòet£aî.</p><p>As regards the syntactic functions of the three preterites—the imperfect, perfect and aorist—the classical writers make virtually no distinction between them, but use them quite indiscriminately. In the older language, on the other hand, the imperfect is chiefly used as a narrative tense, while the other two generally refer to a past action which is now complete—the aorist, however, more frequently to that which is only just done or completed. The perfect, owing doubtless to its reduplicative form, has also not infrequently the force of an iterative, or intensive, present.</p><p>The Sanskrit, like the Greek, shows at all times a considerable power and facility of noun-composition. But, while in the older language, as well as in the earlier literary products of the classical period, such combinations rarely exceed thelimits compatible with the general economy of inflectional speech, during the later, artificial period of the language they gradually become more and more excessive, both in size and frequency of use, till at last they absorb almost the entire range of syntactic construction.</p><p>One of the most striking features of Sanskrit word-formation is that regular interchange of light and strong vowel-sounds, usually designated by the native terms of <hi rend="italic">guṇa</hi> (quality) and <hi rend="italic">vṛiddhi</hi> (increase). The phonetic process implied in these terms consists in the raising, under certain conditions, of a radical or thematic light vowel <hi rend="italic">i, u,</hi> r, <hi rend="italic">l,</hi> by means of an inserted <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-sound, to the diphthongal (guṇa) sounds ă <hi rend="italic">i</hi> (Sans. <hi rend="italic">ē</hi>) <hi rend="italic">, ău</hi> (Sans. <hi rend="italic">ō</hi>), and the combination <hi rend="italic">ar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">al</hi> respectively, and, by a repetition of the same process, to the (vṛiddhi) sounds <hi rend="italic">āi, āu, ār, and āl</hi> respectively. Thus from root <hi rend="italic">υid,</hi> “ to know,” we have <hi rend="italic">vêda,</hi> “ knowledge,” and therefrom <hi rend="italic">vāídika</hi>;from <hi rend="italic">yuj, yoga, yāúgika.</hi> While the interchange of the former kind, due mainly to accentual causes, was undoubtedly a common feature of Indo-Germanic speech, the latter, or vṛiddhi-change, which chiefly occurs in secondary stems, is probably a later development. Moreover, there can be no doubt that the vṛiddhi-vowels are really due to what the term implies, viz. to a process of “ increment," or vowel-raising. The same used to be universally assumed by comparative philologists as regards the relation between the guṇa-sounds <hi rend="italic">ăi</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ē</hi>) and <hi rend="italic">ău</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ō</hi>) and the respective simple <hi rend="italic">i</hi>- and <hi rend="italic">u</hi>-sounds. According to a more recent theory, however, which has been very generally accepted, we have rather to look upon the heavier vowels as the original, and upon the lighter vowels as the later sounds, produced through the absence of stress and pitch. The grounds on which this theory is recommended are those of logical consistency. In the analogous cases of interchange between <hi rend="italic">r</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ar,</hi> as well as <hi rend="italic">ḷ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">al,</hi> most scholars have indeed been wont to regard the syllabic <hi rend="italic">ṛ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ḷ</hi> as weakened from original <hi rend="italic">ar</hi> and <hi rend="italic">al,</hi> while the native grammarians represent the latter as produced from the former by increment. Similarly the verb <hi rend="italic">as</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ĕs</hi>), “ to be, loses its vowel wherever the radical syllable is unaccented, <hi rend="italic">e.g. ásti,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">est—smás, s(u)mus</hi>; opt. <hi rend="italic">syām,</hi> Lat. <hi rend="italic">siēm (sīm).</hi> On the strength of these analogous cases of vowel-modification we are, therefore, to accept some such equation as this</p><p>āsmi: smás = bkρκομat: eδρ(a)κοv = λAπω: λt,πew</p><p><hi rend="italic">= émi</hi> (etμt): <hi rend="italic">imás</hi> (<hi rend="italic">tμev</hi> for <hi rend="italic">lμev</hi>)</p><p><hi rend="italic">— φebyω</hi>: <hi rend="italic">φvyetv</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">= dóhmi</hi> (1 <hi rend="italic">milk) : duhmás.</hi></p><p>Acquiescence in this equation would seem to involve at, least one important admission, viz. that original root-syllables contained no simple <hi rend="italic">i</hi>- and <hi rend="italic">u</hi>-vowels, except as the second element of the diphthongs <hi rend="italic">ai,</hi> <hi rend="italic">ei, oi</hi>; <hi rend="italic">au, eu, ou.</hi> We ought no longer to speak of the roots <hi rend="italic">vid,</hi> “to know” <hi rend="italic">dik,</hi> “to show, to bid," <hi rend="italic">dhugh,</hi> "to milk,” <hi rend="italic">yug,</hi> "to join,” but of <hi rend="italic">veid, deik, dhaugh</hi> or <hi rend="italic">dheugh, yeug,</hi> &amp;amp;c. Nay, as the same law would apply with equal force to suffixal vowels, the suffix <hi rend="italic">nu</hi> would have to be called <hi rend="italic">nau</hi> or <hi rend="italic">neu</hi>; and, in explaining, for instance, the irregularly formed <hi rend="italic">bAwυμι, δAκvvμtv,</hi> we might say that, by the affixion of <hi rend="italic">veu</hi> to the root δelk, the present-stem <hi rend="italic">δ <hi rend="sub">t</hi> tκvd&amp;gt;</hi> was obtained (<hi rend="italic">δt,κvtvμi</hi>), which, as the stress was shifted forward, became 1 plur. <hi rend="italic">δυcvvμkσ</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i</hi>), <hi rend="italic">—</hi> the subsequent modifications in the radical and formative syllables being due to the effects of “ analogy ” (cf. G. Meyer, <hi rend="italic">Griech. Gramm.,</hi> § 487). Now, if there be any truth in the “ agglutination ” theory, according to which the radical and formative elements of Indo-Germanic speech were at one time independent words, we would have to be prepared for a pretty liberal allowance, to the parent language, of diphthongal mono-syllables such as <hi rend="italic">deík neú,</hi> while simple combinations such as <hi rend="italic">dik nu</hi> could only spring up after separate syllable-words had become united by the force of a common accent. But, whether the agglu-tinationists be right or wrong, a theory involving the priority of the diphthongal over the simple sounds can hardly be said to be one of great prima facie probability; and one may well ask whether the requirements of logical consistency might not be satisfied in some other, less improbable, way.</p><p>Now, the analogous cases which have called forth this theory turn upon the loss of a radical or suffixal <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ĕ</hi>), occasioned by the shifting of the word-accent to some other syllable, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> acc. <hi rend="italic">mātáram,</hi> instr. <hi rend="italic">mātrá, πkτυμa,t, brτ6μηv</hi>: <hi rend="italic">δepκομai, eδp(a)κοv</hi>: <hi rend="italic">ásmi, Smás.</hi> Might we not then assume that at an early stage of noun and verb inflection, through the giving way, under certain conditions, of the stem- <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ĕ</hi>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> the habit of stem-gradation, as an element of inflection,</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0159" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0176.jp2"/><p>came to establish itself and ultimately to extend its sphere over stems with <hi rend="italic">i-</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u</hi>-vowels, but that, on meeting here with more resistance<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> We might compare the different treatment in Sanskrit of <hi rend="italic">an</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in</hi> bases (<hi rend="italic">mūrdháni-mūrdhná</hi>; <hi rend="italic">vādíní-vādínā)</hi>; for, though the latter are doubtless of later origin, their inflection might have been expected to be influenced by that of the former. Also a comparison of such forms as (<hi rend="italic">devá</hi>) <hi rend="italic">devánām</hi> (<hi rend="italic">agní</hi>) <hi rend="italic">agriïnâm,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">(dhenú) dhenūnám,</hi> tells in favour of the 1- and <hi rend="italic">u</hi>-vowels, as regards power of resistance, inasmuch as it does not require the accent in order to remain intact. </note> than in the <hi rend="italic">a</hi> (<hi rend="italic">ĕ</hi>)-vowel, the stem-gradation then took the shape of a raising of the simple vowel, in the “ strong ” cases and verb-forms, by that same <hi rend="italic">a</hi>-element which constituted the distinctive element of those cases in the other variable stems? In this way the above equation would still hold good, and the corresponding vowel-grades, though of somewhat different genesis, would yet be strictly analogous. At all events in the opinion of the present writer, the last word has not yet been said on the important point of Indo-Germanic vowel-gradation.</p><p>The accent of Sanskrit words is marked only in the more important Vedic texts, different systems of notation being used in different works. Our knowledge of the later accentuation of words is entirely derived from the statements of grammarians. As in Greek, there are three accents, the <hi rend="italic">udātta</hi> (“ raised,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> acute), the <hi rend="italic">αnudαttα</hi> (“ not raised,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> grave), and the <hi rend="italic">svarita</hi> (“ sounded, modulated,” <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> circumflex). The last is a combination of the two others, its proper use being confined almost entirely to a vowel preceded by a semivowel <hi rend="italic">y</hi> or <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> representing an original acuted vowel. Hindu scholars, however, also include in this term the accent of a grave syllable preceded by an</p><p>acuted syllable, and itself followed by a grave.</p><p>The Sanskrit and Greek accentuations present numerous coincidences. Although the Greek rule, confining the accent within the last three syllables, has frequently obliterated the original likeness, the old features may often be traced through the later forms. Thus, though augmented verb-forms in Greek cannot always have the accent on the augment as in Sanskrit, they have it invariably as little removed from it as the accentual restrictions will allow; <hi rend="italic">e.g. ábharam, eφeρov</hi>: <hi rend="italic">ábharãma, eφepoμtev</hi>: <hi rend="italic">ábharāmahi, eφeρδμeθα.</hi></p><p>The most striking coincidence in noun declension is the accentual distinction made by both languages between the “ strong ” and “ weak ” cases of monosyllabic nouns—the only difference in this respect being that in Sanskrit the accusative plural, as a rule, has the accent on the case-ending, and consequently shows the weak form of the stem; <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> stem <hi rend="italic">pad, ποδ</hi>: <hi rend="italic">pádam, πόδα: padās,</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">ttoÔós:</hi> <hi rend="italic">padí, ττοδί: pádas,</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">tódes:</hi> <hi rend="italic">padas, πδδαsl Padám, ποδών</hi>: <hi rend="italic">patsu, πoσl.</hi> In Sanskrit a few other classes of stems (especially present participles in <hi rend="italic">ant, at</hi>), accented on the last syllable, are apt to yield their accent to heavy vowel (not consonantal) terminations; compare the analogous accentuation of Sanskrit and Greek stems in <hi rend="italic">tär: pitáram,</hi> πατέρα: <hi rend="italic">pitré, πaτρ6s'. pitáras, πaτeρes</hi>: <hi rend="italic">pitṝshu,</hi> τrαrρ(á)σt.</p><p>The vocative, when heading a sentence (or verse-division), has invariably the accent on the first syllable; otherwise it is not accented.</p><p>Finite verb-forms also, as a rule, lose their accent, except when standing at the beginning of a sentence or verse-division (a vocative not being taken into account), or in dependent (mostly relative) clauses, or in conjunction with certain particles. Of two or more co-ordinate verb-forms, however, only the first is unaccented.</p><p>In writing Sanskrit the natives, in different parts of India, generally employ the particular character used for writing their own vernacular.</p><p>The character, however, most widely understood and employed by Hindu scholars, and used invariably in European editions of Sanskrit works (unless printed in</p><p>Roman letters) is the Nãgarî, or “ town-script,” also commonly called <hi rend="italic">Devanāgarī,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">nāgarī</hi> of the gods.</p><p>The origin of the Indian alphabets is still enveloped in doubt. The oldest hitherto known specimens of Indian writing are a number of rock-inscriptions, containing religious edicts in Pali (the Prakrit used in the southern Buddhist scriptures), issued by the emperor Aśoka (Piyadasi) of the Maurya dynasty, in 253-251 B.c., and scattered over the area of northern India from the vicinity of Pesha-war, on the north-west frontier, and Girnar in Gujarat, to Jaugada and Dhauli in Katak, on the eastern coast. The most western of these inscriptions—those found near Kapurdagarhi or Shāhbāz-garhi, and Mansora—are executed in a different alphabet from the others. It reads from right to left, and is usually called the Arian Pali alphabet, it being also used on the coins of the Greek and Indo-Scythian princes of Ariana; while the other, which reads from left to right, is called the Indian Pali alphabet. The former—also called <hi rend="italic">Kharoshṭhī</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gāndhāra</hi> alphabet (<hi rend="italic">lipi</hi>) <hi rend="italic">—</hi> which is manifestly derived from a Semitic (probably Aramaean) source, has left no traces on the subsequent development of Indian writing. The Indo-Pāli (or <hi rend="italic">Brāhmī</hi>) alphabet, on the other hand, from which the modem Indian alphabets are derived, is of more uncertain origin. The similarity, however, which several of its letters present to those of the old Phoenician alphabet (itself probably derived from the Egyptian hieroglyphics) suggests for this alphabet also the probability of a Semitic origin, though, already at Aśoka’s time, the Indians had worked it up to a high degree of perfection and wonderfully adapted it to their peculiar scientific ends. The question as to the probable time and channel of its introduction can scarcely be expected ever to be placed beyond all doubt. The late Professor Bühler has, however, made it very probable that this alphabet was introduced into India by traders from Mesopotamia about 800 B.c. At all events, considering the high state of perfection it exhibits in the Maurya and Andhra inscriptions, as well as the wide area over which these are scattered, it can hardly be doubted that the art of writing must have been known to and practised by the Indians for various purposes long before the time of Aśoka. The fact that no reference to it is found in the contemporary literature has probably to be accounted for by a strong reluctance on the part of the Brahmans to commit their sacred works to writing.</p><p>As regards the numeral signs used in India, the Kharoshṭhī inscriptions of the early centuries of our era show a numerical system in which the first three numbers are represented by as many vertical strokes, whilst 4 is marked by a slanting cross, and 5-9 by 4(.+) 1, &amp;amp;c., to 4(+)4(+)1; then special signs for 10, 20 and 100, the intervening multiples of 10 being marked in the vigesimal fashion, thus 50=20(+)20(+)10. This system has been proved to be of Semitic, probably Aramaic, origin. In the Brāhmī inscriptions up to the end of the 6th century of our era, another system is used in which 1-3 are denoted by as many horizontal strokes, and thereafter by special syllabic signs for 4-9, the decades 10-90, and for 100 and 1000. T his system was most likely derived from hieratic sources of Egypt. The decimal system of cipher notation, on the other hand, which is first found used on a Gujarat inscription of .A.D. 595, seems to be an invention of Indian astronomers or mathematicians, based on the existing syllabic (or word) signs or equivalents thereof.</p><p>The first two Sanskrit grammars published by Europeans were those of the Austrian Jesuit Wesdin, called Paulinus a Sancto Bartholomaeo (Rome, 1790-1804). These were followed by those of H. C. Colebrooke (1805; based on Pāṇini’s system), Carey (1806), Wilkins (1808), Forster (1810), F. Bopp (1827), H. H. Wilson, Th. Benfey, &amp;amp;c. These, as well as those of Max Müller, Monier Williams and F. Kielhorn, now most widely used, deal almost exclusively with classical Sanskrit; whilst that of W. D. Whitney treats the whole language historically; as does also J. Wackernagel’s not yet completed <hi rend="italic">Altindische Grammatik.</hi></p><p>The first Sanskrit dictionary was that of H. H. Wilson (1819; 2nd ed., 1832), which was followed by the great Sanskrit-German <hi rend="italic">Wōrterbuch,</hi> published at St Petersburg in 7 vols, by Professors Böhtlingk and Roth. Largely based on this great thesaurus are the Sanskrit-English dictionaries by Sir M. Williams (2nd ed., 1899), Th. Benfey, A. A. Macdonell, &amp;amp;c. On the history of the Indian alphabets, cf. G.

Sanskrit Literature</p><p>The history of Sanskrit literature labours under the same disadvantage as the political history of ancient India from the total want of anything like a fixed chronology. In that vast range of literary development there is scarcely a work of importance the date of which scholars have fixed with absolute certainty. The original composition of most Sanskrit works can indeed be confidently assigned to certain general periods of literature, but as to many of them, and these among the most important, scholars have but too much reason to doubt whether they have come down to us in their original shape, or whether they have not undergone alterations and additions so serious as to make it impossible to regard them as genuine witnesses of any one phase of the development of the Indian mind. Nor can we expect many important chronological data from new materials brought to light in India. Though by such discoveries a few isolated spots may be lighted up here and there, the real task of clearing away the mist which at present obscures our view, if ever it can be cleared away, will have to be performed by patient research and a more minute critical examination of the multitudinous writings which have been handed down from the remote past. In the following sketch it is intended to take a rapid view of the more important works and writers in the several departments of literature.</p><p>In accordance with the two great phases of linguistic development referred to, the history of Sanskrit literature readily divides itself into two principal periods—the Vedic and the classical. These periods partly overlap, and some of the later Vedic work are included in that period on account of the subjects with which they deal, and for their archaic style, rather than for any just claim to a higher antiquity than may have to be assigned to the oldest works of the classical Sanskrit.</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0160" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0177.jp2"/><p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Vedic Period</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> J. Muir’s <hi rend="italic">Original Sanskrit Texts</hi> (5 vols., 2nd ed.) forms the most complete general survey of the results of Vedic research. </note> <hi rend="smallcaps"/></p><p>The term <hi rend="italic">υeda—i.e. “</hi> knowledge,” (sacred) “ lore ”—embraces a body of writings the origin of which is ascribed to divine revelation <hi rend="italic">(śruti,</hi> literally “ hearing ”), and which forms the foundation of the Brāhmanical system of religious behef. This sacred canon is divided into three or (according to a later scheme) four co-ordinate collections, likewise called Veda: (1) the <hi rend="italic">Ṛig-υeda,</hi> or lore of praise (or hymns); (2) the <hi rend="italic">Säma-veda,</hi> or lore of tunes (or chants); (3) the <hi rend="italic">Yajurveda,</hi> or lore of prayer (or sacrificial formulas); and (4) the <hi rend="italic">Atharva-veda,</hi> or lore of the Atharvans. Each of these four Vedas consists primarily of a collection (<hi rend="italic">saṃhitā</hi>) of sacred, mostly poetical, texts of a devotional nature, called <hi rend="italic">mantra.</hi> This entire body of texts (and particularly the first three collections) is also frequently referred to as the <hi rend="italic">trayī vidyā,</hi> or threefold wisdom, of hymn (<hi rend="italic">rich</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="4"> The combination <hi rend="italic">ch,</hi> used (in conformity with the usual English practice) in this sketch of the literature, corresponds to the simple <hi rend="italic">c</hi> —as <hi rend="italic">ṛi</hi> does to <hi rend="italic">ṛ—</hi> in the scheme of the alphabet. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>) <hi rend="italic">,</hi> tune or chant <hi rend="italic">(säman),</hi> and prayer <hi rend="italic">(yajus)—</hi> the fourth Veda, if at all included, being in that case</p><p>classed together with the Rik.</p><p>The Brãhmanical religion finds its practical expression chiefly in sacrificial performances. The Vedic sacrifice requires for its proper performance the attendance of four officiating priests, each of whom is assisted by one or more (usually three) subordinate priests, viz.: (1) the</p><p><hi rend="italic">Hotar</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">hotṛi, i.e.</hi> either “ sacrificer,” or “ invoker ”), whose chief business is to invoke the gods, either in short prayers pronounced over the several oblations, or in liturgical recitations <hi rend="italic">(éastra),</hi> made up of various hymns and detached verses; (2) the <hi rend="italic">Udgātar</hi> (udgātṛi), or chorister, who has to perform chants <hi rend="italic">(stotra)</hi> in connexion with the hotar’s recitations; (3) the <hi rend="italic">Adhvaryu,</hi> or offering priest <hi rend="italic">par excellence,</hi> who performs all the material duties of the sacrifice, such as the kindling of the fires, the preparation of the sacrificial ground and the offerings, the making of oblations, &amp;amp;c.; (4) the <hi rend="italic">Brahman,</hi> or chief “priest,” who has to superintend the performance and to rectify any mistakes that may be committed. Now, the first three of these priests stand in special relation to three of the Vedic Saṃhitās in this way: that the Saṃhitās of the Sāmaveda and Yajurveda form special song and prayer books, arranged for the practical use of the udgātar and adhvaryu respectively; whilst the Ṛik-saṃhitā, though not arranged for any such practical purpose, contains the entire body of sacred lyrics whence the hotar draws the material for his recitations. The brahman, however, had no special text-book assigned to him, but was expected to be familiar with all the Sarµhitâs as well as with the practical details of the sacrificial performance (see Brahman and Brähmana). It sometimes happens that verses not found in our version of the Ṛik-saṃhitā, but in the Atharvavedasaṃhitā, are used by the hotar; but such texts, if they did not actually form part of some other version of the Ṛik—as Sāyaṇa in the introduction to his commentary on the Ṛik-saṃhitā assures us that they did—were probably inserted in the liturgy subsequent to the recognition of the fourth Veda.</p><p>The several Saṃhitās have attached to them certain theological prose works, called <hi rend="italic">Brāhmaṇa,</hi> which, though subordinate in authority to the Mantras or Sarphitâs, are like them held to be divinely revealed and to form part of the canon. The chief works of this class are of an exegetic nature,—their purport being to supply a dogmatic exposition of the sacrificial ceremonial and to explain the mystic import of the different rites and utterances included therein (sec</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Brähmana).</hi></p><p>More or less closely connected with the Brāhmaṇas (and in a few exceptional cases with Saṃhitās) are two classes of treatises, called <hi rend="italic">Āraṇyaka</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Upanishad.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Āraṇyakas</hi>, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> works “ relating to the forest,” being intended to be read by those who have retired from the world and lead the life of anchorites, do not greatly differ in character and style from the Brāhmaṇas,</p><p>but like them are chiefly ritualistic, treating of special ceremonies not dealt with, or dealt with only imperfectly, in the latter works, to which they thus stand in the relation of supplements. The Upanishads, however, are of a purely speculative nature, and must be looked upon as the first attempts at a systematic treatment of metaphysical questions. The number of Upanishads hitherto known is very considerable (about 170); but, though they nearly all profess to belong to the Atharvaveda, they have to be assigned to very different periods of Sanskrit literature—some of them being evidently quite modern productions. The oldest treatises of this kind are doubtless those which form part of the Saṃhitās, Brãhmanas and Āraṇyakas of the three older Vedas, though not a few others which have no such special connexion have to be classed with the later products of the Vedic age.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="5"> Cf.

Deussen, <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of the Upanishads</hi> (Edinburgh, 1906), where these treatises are classified; Jacob, <hi rend="italic">A Concordance to the Principal Upanishads and Bhagavadgītā</hi> (Bombay S.S., 1891). </note></p><p>As the sacred texts were not committed to writing till a much later period, but were handed down orally in the Brãhmaṇical schools, it was inevitable that local differences of reading should spring up, which in course of time gave rise to a number of independent versions. Such different text-recensions, called <hi rend="italic">śākhā (Le.</hi> branch), were at one time very numerous, but only a limited number have survived. As regards the Saiµhitãs, the poetical form of the hymns, as well as the concise style of the sacrificial formulas, would render these texts less liable to change, and the discrepancies of different versions would chiefly consist in various readings of single words or in the different arrangement of the textual matter. But the diffuse ritualistic discussions and loosely connected legendary illustrations of the Brāhmaṇas offered scope for very considerable modifications in the traditional matter, either through the ordinary processes of oral transmission or through the special influence of individual teachers.</p><p>Besides the purely ceremonial matter, the Brāhmaṇas also contained a considerable amount of matter bearing on the correct interpretation of the Vedic texts; and, indeed, the sacred obligation incumbent on the Brahmans of handing down correctly the letter and* sense of those texts necessarily involved a good deal of serious grammatical and etymological study in the Brāhmaṇical schools. These literary pursuits could not but result in the accumulation of much learned material, which it would become more and more desirable to throw into a systematic form, serving at the same time as a guide for future research. These practical requirements were met by a class of treatises, grouped under six different heads or subjects, called <hi rend="italic">Vedāngas, Le.</hi> members, or limbs, of the (body of the) Veda. None of the works, however, which have come down to us under this designation can lay any just claim to being considered the original treatises on their several subjects; they evidently represent a more or less advanced stage of scientific development. Though a few of them are composed in metrical form—especially in the ordinary epic couplet, the <hi rend="italic">anushṭubh śloka,</hi> consisting of two lines of sixteen syllables (or of two octosyllabic pādas) each—the majority belong to a class of writings called <hi rend="italic">sūtra, i.e. “</hi> string,” consisting of strings of rules in the shape of tersely expressed aphorisms, intended to be committed to memory. The Sūtras form a connecting link between the Vedic and the classical periods of literature. But, although these treatises, so far as they deal with Vedic subjects, are included by the native authorities among the Vedic writings, and in point of language may, generally speaking, be considered as the latest products of the Vedic age, they have no share in the sacred title of <hi rend="italic">śruti</hi> or revelation. They are of human, not of divine, origin. Yet, as the production of men of the highest standing, profoundly versed in Vedic lore, the Sutras are regarded as works of great authority, second only to that of the revealed Scriptures; and their relation to the latter is expressed in the generic title of <hi rend="italic">Smṛiti,</hi> or Tradition, usually applied to them.</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0161" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0178.jp2"/><p>The six branches of Vedic science, included under the term Vedānga, are as follows:—</p><p>1. Ś <hi rend="italic">ikshā,</hi> or Phonetics,—The privileged position of representing this subject is assigned to a small treatise ascribed to the great</p><p>grammarian Pãnini, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Pāṇinīyā śikshā,</hi> extant in two different (Rik and Yajus) recensions. But neither this treatise nor any other of the numerous śikshās which have recently come to light can lay claim to any very high age. Scholars, however, usually include under this head certain works, called <hi rend="italic">Prātiśākhya, i.e.</hi> “ belonging to a certain śā <hi rend="italic">khā</hi> or recension,” which deal minutely with the phonetic peculiarities of the several Saṃhitās, and are of great importance for the textual criticism of the</p><p>Vedic Samhitãs.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Chhandas,</hi> or Metre.—Tradition makes the <hi rend="italic">Chhandaḥ-sūtra</hi> of Pingala the starting-point of prosody. The Vedic metres, however,</p><p>occupy but a small part of this treatise, and they are evidently dealt with in a more original manner in the</p><p>Nidāna-sūtra of the Sāmaveda,and in a chapter of theRik-pratisãkhya. For profane prosody, on the other hand, Pingala’s treatise is rather valuable, no less than 160 metres being described by him.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Vyākaraṇa,</hi> or Grammar.—Pāṇini’s famous grammar is said to be <hi rend="italic">the</hi> Vedãnga; but it marks the culminating point of grammatical research rather than the beginning, and</p><p>besides treats chiefly of the post-Vedic language.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Nirukta,</hi> or Etymology.—Yaska’s <hi rend="italic">Nirukta</hi> is the traditional representative of this subject, and this important work certainly</p><p>deals entirely with Vedic etymology and explanation. It consists, in the first place, of strings of words in three chapters: (1) synonymous words; (2) such as are purely or chiefly Vedic; and (3) names of deities. These lists are followed by Yāska’s commentary, interspersed with numerous illustrations. Yāska, again, quotes several predecessors in the same branch of science; and it is probable that the original works on this subject consisted merely of lists of words similar to those handed down by</p><p>him∙</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Jyotisha,</hi> or Astronomy.—Although astronomical calculations are frequently referred to in older works in connexion with the</p><p>performance of sacrifices, the metrical treatise which has come down to us in two different recensions under the title of Jyotisha, ascribed to one Lagadha, or Lagata, seems indeed to be the oldest existing systematic treatise on astronomical subjects. With the exception of some apparently spurious verses of one of the recensions, it betrays no sign of the Greek influence which shows itself in Hindu astronomical works from about the 3rd century of our era; and its date may therefore be set down</p><p>as probably not later than the early centuries after Christ</p><p>6. <hi rend="italic">Kalpa,</hi> or Ceremonial.—Tradition does not sîngIe out any special work as the Vedãnga in this branch of Vedic science; but</p><p>the sacrificial practice gave rise to a large number of systematic sütra-manuals for the several classes of priests. The most important of these works have come down to us, and they occupy by far the most prominent place among the literary productions of the sūtra-period. The Kalpa-sūtras, or rules of ceremonial, are of two kinds: (1) the <hi rend="italic">Srauta-sütras,</hi> which are based on the sruti, and teach the performance of the great sacrifices, requiring three sacrificial fires; and (2) the <hi rend="italic">Smārta-sūtras,</hi> or rules based on the smṛiti or tradition. The latter dass again includes two kinds of treatises: (1) the <hi rend="italic">Gṛihya-sūtras,</hi> or domestic rules, treating of ordinary family rites, such as marriage, birth, name-giving, &amp;amp;c., connected with simple offerings in the domestic fire; and (2) the <hi rend="italic">Sāmayāchārika-</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Dharma-</hi>) <hi rend="italic">sütras,</hi> which treat of customs and temporal duties, and are supposed to have formed the chief sources of the later law-books. Besides, the Srauta-sütras of the Yajurveda have usually attached to them a set of so-called <hi rend="italic">Śulva-sūtras, i.e.</hi> “ rules of the cord,” which treat of the measurement by means of cords, and the construction, of different kinds of altars required for sacrifices. These treatises are of special interest as supplying important information regarding the earliest geometrical operations in India. Along with the Sutras may be classed a large number of supplementary treatises, usually called <hi rend="italic">Pariéishta</hi> (ταpαλi7r0μepα), on various subjects connected with the sacred texts and Vedic religion generally.</p><p>After this brief characterization of the various branches of Vedic literature, we proceed to take a rapid survey of the several Vedic collections.</p><p>A. <hi rend="italic">Rigveda.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="6"> The Rigveda has been edited, together with the commentary of Sāyaṇa (of the 14th century), by Max Müfler (6 vols., London, 1849-1874; 2nd ed., 4 vols., 1890-1892). The same scholar has published an edition of the hymns, both in the connected (<hi rend="italic">saṃhitā</hi>) and the disjoined (<hi rend="italic">pada</hi>) texts, 1873-1877. An edition in Roman transliteration was published by Th, Aufrecht (Berlin, 1861-1863, 2nd ed. 1877). Part of an English translation (chiefly based on Sāyaṇa’s interpretation) was brought out by the late Professor H. H. Wilson (vols. i.-iii., 1850-1857) and completed by Professor E. B. Cowell (vols. iv.-vi., 1866-1888). We have also the first volume of a translation, with a running </note> <hi rend="italic"/>—The <hi rend="italic">Ṛigveda-saṃhitā</hi> has come down to us in the</p><p>recension of the Sãkala school. Mention is made of several other versions; and regarding one of them, that of the Bãshkalas, we have some further information, according to which it seems, however, to have differed but little from the Sākala text The latter consists of 1028 hymns, including eleven so-called <hi rend="italic">Vālakhilyas,</hi> which were probably introduced into the collection subsequently to its completion. The hymns are composed in a great variety of metres, and consist, on an average, of rather more than 10 verses each, or about 10,600 verses altogether. This body of sacred lyrics has been subdivided by ancient authorities in a twofold way, viz. either from a purely artificial point of view, into eight <hi rend="italic">ashṭakas</hi> of about equal length, or, on a more natural principle, based on the origin of the hymns, and invariably adopted by European scholars, into ten books, or <hi rend="italic">maṇḍalas,</hi> of unequal length. Tradition (not, however, always trustworthy in this respect) has handed down the names of the reputed authors, or rather inspired “ seers ” (<hi rend="italic">ṛishi</hi>), of most hymns. These indications have enabled scholars to form some idea as to the probable way in which the Ṛik-saṃhitā originated, though much still remains to be cleared up by future research.</p><p>Maṇḍalas ii.-vii. are evidently arranged on a uniform plan. Each of them is ascribed to a different family of rishis, whence they are usually called the six “family-books”: ii., the Gṛitsamadas; ifi., the Viśvāmitras or Kuśikas; iv., the Vãmadevyas; v., the Atris; vi., the Bharadvãjas; and vii., the Vasishṭhas. Further, each of these books begins with the hymns addressed to Agni, the god of fire, which are followed by those to Indra, the Jupiter Pluvius, whereupon follow those addressed to minor deities—the Viśve Devāḥ (“ all-gods ”), the Maruts (storm-gods), &amp;amp;c. Again, the hymns addressed to each deity are arranged in a descending order, according to the number of verses of which they consist.</p><p>Maṇḍala i., the longest in the whole Saṃhitā, contains 191 hymns, ascribed, with the exception of a few isolated ones, to sixteen poets of different families, and consisting of one larger (50 hymns) and nine shorter collections. Here again the hymns of each author are arranged on precisely the same principle as the “ family-books.” Maṇḍalas viii. and ix., on the other hand, have a special character of their own. To the Sãmaveda-sarphitã, which, as we shall see, consists almost entirely of verses chosen from the Ṛik for chanting purposes, these two maṇḍalas have contributed a much larger proportion of verses than any of the others. Now, the hymns of the eighth book are ascribed to a number of different ṛishis, mostly belonging to the Kāṇva family. The productions of each poet are usually, though not always, grouped together, but no other principle of arrangement has yet been discovered. The chief peculiarity of this maṇḍala, however, consists in its metres. Many of the hymns are composed in the form of stanzas, called <hi rend="italic">pragātha</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">gā,</hi> "to sing ”), consisting of two verses in the <hi rend="italic">bṛihatī</hi> and <hi rend="italic">satobrihatī</hi> metres; whence this book is usually known under the designation of Pragã-thās. The other metres met with in this book are likewise such as were evidently considered peculiarly adapted for singing, viz. the <hi rend="italic">gāyatrī</hi> (from <hi rend="italic">gā,</hi> “ to sing ’ ) and other chiefly octosyllabic metres. It is not yet clear how to account for these peculiarities; but further research may perhaps show either that the Kāṇvas were a family of udgãtars, or chanters, or that, before the establishment of a common system of worship for the Brãhmanical community, they were accustomed to carry on their liturgical service exclusively by means of chants, instead of using the later form of mixed recitation and chant. One of the ṛishis of this family is called Pragãtha Kāṇva; possibly this surname “ pragãtha ” may be an old, or local, synonym of udgātar, or perhaps of the chief chanter, the so-called <hi rend="italic">Prastotar,</hi> or precentor. Another poet of this family is Medhãtithi Kãnva, who has likewise assigned to him twelve hymns in the first and largest groups of the first book. The ninth maṇḍala, on the other hand, consists entirely of hymns (114) addressed to <hi rend="italic">Soma,</hi> the deified juice of the so-called “moon-plant” (<hi rend="italic">Sarcostemma viminale,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Asclepias acida</hi>), and ascribed to poets of different families. They are called <hi rend="italic">pavamānī,</hi> “ purificational,” because they were to be recited by the hotar while the juice expressed from the soma plants was clarifying. The first sixty of these hymns are arranged strictly according to their length, ranging from ten down to four verses; but as to the remaining hymns no such principle of arrangement is observable, except perhaps in smaller groups of hymns. One might, therefore, feel inclined to look upon that first section as the body of soma hymns set apart, at the time of the first redaction of the Samhitä, for the special purpose of being used as <hi rend="italic">pavamānyas,—</hi> the remaining hymns having been added at subsequent redactions. It would not, however, by any means follow that all,</p><p>commentary, by M. Mullet, containing 12 hymns to the Maruts or storm-gods (1869). These were reprinted, together with the remaining hymns to the Maruts, and those addressed to Rudra, Vāyu and Vāta, Vedic Hymns I. in <hi rend="italic">S.B.E</hi>., vol. xxxii. (1891); where (vol. xlvi.) H. Oldenberg has also translated the hymns to Agni, in maṇḍalas 1-5. A metrical English translation was published by R. H. T. Griffith (2 vols., Benares, 1896-1897). Complete German translations have been published, in verse, by H. Grassmann (1876-1877) and, in prose, with comm., A. Ludwig (1876-1888). Cf. also Kaegi, <hi rend="italic">The Rigveda</hi> (Eng. trans. by Arrowsmith, Boston, 1886).</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0162" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0179.jp2"/><p>or even any, of the latter hymns were actually later productions, as they might previously have formed part of the family collections, or might have been overlooked when the hymns were first collected. Other maṇḍalas (viz. i. viii. and x.) still contain four entire hymns addressed to Soma, consisting together of 58 verses, of which only a single one (x. 25, 1) is found in the Sāmaveda-saṃhitā, as also some 28 isolated verses to Soma, and four hymns addressed to Soma in conjunction with some other deity, which are entirely unrepresented in that collection.</p><p>Maṇḍala x. contains the same number of hymns (191) as the first, which it nearly equals in actual length. The hymns are ascribed to many ṛishis, of various families, some of whom appear already in the preceding maṇḍalas. The traditional record is, however, less to be depended upon as regards this book, many names of gods and fictitious personages appearing in the list of its ṛishis. In the latter half of the book the hymns are clearly arranged according to the number of verses, in decreasing order—occasional exceptions to this rule being easily adjusted by the removal of a few apparently added verses. A similar arrangement seems also to suggest itself in other portions of the book. This maṇḍala stands somewhat apart from the preceding books, both its language and the general character of many of its hymns betraying a more recent origin. In this respect it comes nearer to the level of the Atharvaveda-saṃhitā, with which it is otherwise closely connected. Of some 1350 Ṛik-verses found in the Atharvan, about 550, or rather more than 40%, occur in the tenth maṇḍala. In the latter we meet with the same tendencies as in the Atharvan to metaphysical speculation and abstract conceptions of the deity on the one hand, and to superstitious practices on the other. But, although in its general appearance the tenth maṇḍala is decidedly more modern than the other books, it contains not a few hymns which are little, if at all, inferior, both in respect oí age and poetic quality, to the generality of Vedic hymns, being perhaps such as had escaped the attentions oí the former collectors.</p><p>It has become the custom, after Roth’s example, to call the Rik-saṃhitā (as well as the Atharvan) an historical collection, as compared with the Saiphitãs put together for purely ritualistic purposes. And indeed, though the several family collections which make up the earlier maṇḍalas may originally have served ritual ends, as the hymnals of certain clans or tribal confederacies, and although the Sarphitã itself, in its oldest form, may have been intended as a common prayer-book, so to speak, for the whole of the Brāhmaṇical community, it is certain that in the stage in which it has been finally handed down it includes a certain portion of hymn material (and even some secular poetry) which could never have been used for purposes of religious service. It may, therefore, be assumed that the Ṛik-saṃhitā contains all of the nature of popular lyrics that was accessible to the collectors, or seemed to them worthy of being preserved. The question as to the exact period when the hymns were collected cannot be answered with any approach</p><p>to accuracy. For many reasons, however, which cannot be detailed here, scholars have come to fix on the year 1000 b.c. as an approximate date for the collection of the Vedic hymns. From that time every means that human ingenuity could suggest was adopted to secure the sacred texts against the risks connected with . oral transmission. But, as there is abundant evidence to show that even then not only had the text of the hymns suffered corruption, but their language had become antiquated to a considerable extent, and was only partly understood, the period during which the great mass of the hymns were actually composed must have lain considerably farther back, and may very likely have extended over the earlier half of the second millenary, or from about 2000 to 1500 B.c.</p><p>As regards the people which raised for itself this imposing monument, the hymns exhibit it as settled in the regions watered by the mighty Sindhu (Indus), with its eastern and western tributaries, the land of the five rivers thus forming the central home of the Vedic people. But, while its advanced guard has already debouched upon the plains of the upper Gangā and Yamunā, those who bring up the rear are still found loitering far behind in the narrow glens of the Kubhā (Cabul) and Gomatī (Gomal). Scattered over this tract of land, in hamlets and villages, the Vedic Āryas are leading chiefly the life of herdsmen and husbandmen. The numerous clans and tribes, ruled over by chiefs and kings, have still constantly to vindicate their right to the land but lately wrung from an inferior race <hi rend="italic">of</hi> darker hue; just as in these latter days their Aryan kinsmen in the Far West are ever on their guard against the fierce attacks of the dispossessed red-skin. Not unfrequently, too, the light-coloured Āryas wage internecine war with one another—as when the Bharatas, with allied tribes of the Panjab, goaded on by the royal sage Viśvāmitra, invade the country of the Tṛitsu king Sudãs, to be defeated in the “ ten kings’ battle,” through the inspired power of the priestly singer Vasishṭha. The priestly office has already become one of high social importance by the side of the political rulers, and to a large extent an hereditary profession; though it does not yet present the baneful features of an exclusive caste. The Aryan housewife shares with her husband the daily toil and joy, the privilege of worshipping the national gods and even the triumphs of song-craft, some of the finest hymns being attributed to female seers.</p><p>The religious belief of the people consists in a system of natural symbolism, a worship of the elementary forces of nature, regarded as beings endowed with reason and power superior to those of man. In giving utterance to this simple belief, the priestly spokesman has, however, frequently worked into it his own speculative and mystic notions. Indra, the stout-hearted ruler of the cloud-region, receives by far the largest share of the devout attentions of the Vedic singer. His ever-renewed battle with the malicious demons of darkness and drought, for the recovery of the heavenly light and the rain-spending cows of the sky, forms an inexhaustible theme of spirited song. Next to him, in the affections of the people, stands Agni (ignis), the god of fire, invoked as the genial inmate of the Aryan household, and as the bearer of oblations, and mediator between gods and men. Indra and Agni are thus, as it were, the divine representatives of the king (or chief) and the priest of the Aryan community; and if, in the arrangement of the Saṃhitā, the Brāhmanical collectors gave precedence to Agni. It was but one of many avowals of their own hierarchical pretensions. Hence also the hymns to Indra are mostly followed, in the family collections, by those addressed to the Viśve Devāḥ (the "all-gods ”) or to the Maruts, the warlike storm-gods and faithful companions of lndra, as the divine impersonations of the Aryan freemen, the <hi rend="italic">viś</hi> or clan. But, while Indra and Agni are undoubtedly the favourite figures of the Vedic pantheon, there is reason to believe that these gods had but lately supplanted another group of deities who play a less prominent part in the hymns, viz. Father Heaven (Dyaus Pitar, Zeis <hi rend="italic">πατήρ,</hi> Jupiter); Varuna (probably <hi rend="italic">ol·pavòs),</hi> the all-embracing (esp. nocturnal) heavens; Mitra (Zend. Mithra), the genial light of day; and Savitar, the quickener, and Sūrya (neλtos), the vivifying sun.</p><p>Of the Brāhmaṇas that were handed down in the schools of the <hi rend="italic">Bahvṛichas</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> “ possessed of many verses ”), as the followers of the Ṛigveda are called, two have come down to us, viz. those of the Aitareyins and the Kaushītakins. The <hi rend="italic">Aitareya-brāhmaṇa</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="7"> Edited, with an English translation, by M. Haug (2 vols., Bombay, 1863).

They differ, however, considerably as regards both the arrangement of this matter and their stylistic handling of it, with the exception of the numerous legends common to both, in which the discrepancy is comparatively slight. There is also a certain amount of material peculiar to each of them. The Kaushïtaka is, upon the whole, far more concise in its style and more systematic in its arrangement—features which would lead one to infer that it is probably the more modern work of the two. It consists of thirty chapters (<hi rend="italic">adhyāya</hi>); while the Aitareya has forty, divided into eight books (or pentads, <hi rend="italic">panchakā</hi>), of five chapters each. The last ten adhyäyas of the latter work are, however, clearly a later addition—though they must have already formed part of it at the time of Pāṇini (c. 400 B.c. ?), if, as seems probable, one of his grammatical sūtras, regulating the formation of the names of Brāhmaṇas, consisting of thirty and forty adhyāyas, refers to these two works. In this last portion occurs the well-known legend (also found in the Sãnkhãyana-sütra, but not in the Kaushītaki-brāhmaṇa) of Śunaḥśepa, whom his father Ajīgarta sells and offers to slay, the recital of which formed part of the inauguration of kings. While the Aitareya deals almost exclusively with the Soma sacrifice, the Kaushïtaka, in its first six chapters, treats of the several kinds oí <hi rend="italic">haviryajña,</hi> or offerings of rice, milk, ghee, &amp;amp;c., whereupon follows the Soma sacrifice in this way, that chapters 7-10 contain the practical ceremonial and 11-30 the recitations (<hi rend="italic">śastra</hi>) of the hotar. Sāyaṇa, in the introduction to his commentary on the work, ascribes the Aitareya to the sage Mahidãsa Aitareya (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> son of Itarā), also mentioned elsewhere as a philosopher; and it seems likely enough that this person arranged the Brāhmaṇa and founded the school of the Aitareyins. Regarding the authorship of the sister work we have no information, except that the opinion of the sage Kaushîtaki is frequently referred to in it as authoritative, and generally in opposition to the Paingya—the Brāhmaṇa, it would seem, of a rival school, the Paingins. Probably, therefore, it is just what one of the manuscripts calls it—the Brāhmaṇa of Sānkhāyana (composed) in accordance with the views of Kaushītaki.</p><p>Each of these two Brāhmaṇas is supplemented by a “ forest-book,” or Āraṇyaka.

Śaunaka himself is said to have been the author of a árauta-sutra (which was, however, more of the nature of a Brãhmana) and to have destroyed it on seeing his pupil’s work. A Gṛihya-sutra is still quoted under his name by later writers.

The Sãnkhãyana árauta-sutra consists of eighteen adhyãyas. The last two chapters of the work are, however, a later addition,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="15"> See A.

In our remarks on the Vedāngas, the Prātiśkhyas have already been referred to as the chief repositories of sikshã or Vedic phonetics. Among these works the <hi rend="italic">Ṛik-prātiśākhya</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="18"> Edited, with a French translation, by A. Regnier, in the <hi rend="italic">Journal Asiatique</hi> (1856-1858); also, with a German translation, by M. Müller (1869). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>occupies the first place. The original composition of this important work is ascribed to the same <hi rend="italic">Sãkalya</hi> from whom the vulgate recension of the (Śākala) Saiphitã takes its name. He is also said to be the author of the existing <hi rend="italic">Padapāṭha</hi> (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the text-form in which each word is given unconnected with those that precede and follow it), which report may well be credited, since the pada-text was doubtless prepared with a view to an examination, such as is presented in the Prãtisâkhya, of the phonetic modifications undergone by words in their syntactic combination. In the Prātiśākhya itself, Śākalya’s father (or Sãkalya the elder) is also several times referred to as an authority on phonetics, though the younger Sãkalya is evidently regarded as having improved on his father’s theories. Thus both father and son probably had a share in the formulation of the rules of</p><p>pronunciation and modification of Vedic sounds. The completion or final arrangement of the Rik-prãtisãkhya, in its present form, is ascribed to Śaunaka, the reputed teacher of Ãsvalãyana. Śaunaka, however, is merely a family name (“ descendant of Śunaka which is given even to the ṛishi Gṛitsamada, to whom nearly the whole of the second maṇḍala of the Ṛik is attributed. How long after Śākalya this particular Śaunaka lived we do not know ; but some generations at all events would seem to lie between them, considering that in the meantime the Śākalas, owing doubtless to minor differences on phonetic points in the Saṃhitā text, had split into several branches, to one of which, the Saisira (or Saisirïya) school, Śaunaka belonged. While Sãkalya is referred to both by Yãska and Pāṇini, neither of these writers mentions Śaunaka. It seems, nevertheless, likely, for several reasons, that Pāṇini was acquainted with Śaunaka’s work, though the point has by no means been definitely settled. The Rik-prãtisãkhya is composed in mixed ślokas, or couplets of various metres, a form of composition for which Śaunaka seems to have had a special predilection. Besides the Prãtisâkhya, and the Gphya-sötra mentioned above, eight other works are ascribed to Saunaka, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Bṛihaddevatā,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="19"> Edited, with translation, by A. A. Macdonell (2 vols.), in the Harvard Or. series ( 1904). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>an account, in epic ślokas, of the deities of the hymns, which supplies much valuable mythological information ; <hi rend="italic">the Ṛig-vidhāna,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="20"> Edited R.

It is, however, doubtful whether the existing version of the Bphaddevatã is the original one; and the Rigvidhãna would seem to be much more modern than Śaunaka’s time. As regards the Anukramaṇīs, they seem all to have been composed in mixed ślokas; but, with the exception of the Anuvãkãnukramanï, they are only known from quotations, having been superseded by the <hi rend="italic">Sarvānukramaṇī,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="21"> Edited, with commentary, by A.

The set chants (stotra) of the Soma sacrifice are as a rule performed in triplets, either actually consisting of three different verses, or of two verses which, by the repetition of certain parts, are made, as it were, to form three.</p><p>The three verses are usually chanted to the same tune ; but in certain cases two verses sung to the same tune had a different sãman enclosed between them. One and the same sãman or tune may thus be sung to many different verses; but, as in teaching and practising the tunes the same verse was invariably used for a certain tune, the term “ sãman,” as well as the special technical names of sāmans, are not infrequently applied to the verses themselves with which they were ordinarily connected, just as one would quote the beginning of the text of an English hymn, when the tune usually sung to that hymn is meant. For a specimen of the way in which sãmans are sung, see Burnell, <hi rend="italic">Ārsheyabrāhmaṇa,</hi> p. xlv. seq.</p><p>The Indian chant somewhat resembles the Gregorian or Plain Chant.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="22"> Burnell, <hi rend="italic">Ārsheyabrāhmaṇa,</hi> p. xli. </note> Each sãman is divided into five parts or phrases (<hi rend="italic">prastāva,</hi> or prelude, &amp;amp;c.), the first four of which are distributed between the several chanters, while the finale (<hi rend="italic">nidhana</hi>) is sung in unison by all of them.</p><p>In accordance with the distinction between <hi rend="italic">ṛich</hi> or text and <hi rend="italic">sãman</hi> or tune, the sāman-hymnal consists of two parts, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Sāmaveda-saṃhitā,</hi> or collection of texts (rich) used for making up sāman-hymns, and the <hi rend="italic">Gāna,</hi> or tune-books, song-books. The textual matter of the Saiphitã consists of somewhat under 1600 different verses, selected from the Rik-saṃhitā, with the exception of some seventy-five verses, some of which have been taken from Khila hymns, whilst others which also occur in the Atharvan or Yajurveda, as well as such not otherwise found, may perhaps have formed part of some other recension of the Ṛik. The <hi rend="italic">Samaυeda-saṃhitā</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="23"> Edited and translated by J. Stevenson (1843); a critical edition, with German translation and glossary, was publishedby Th. Benfey (1848); also an edition, with the Gānas and Sāyaṇa’s commentary, by Satyavrata Sāmāśramī, in the <hi rend="italic">Bibl. Ind.</hi> in 5 vols. ; and Eng. trans. by R. H. T. Griffith (Benares, 1893). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>is divided into two chief parts, the <hi rend="italic">purυa-</hi> (first) and the <hi rend="italic">uttara-</hi> (second) <hi rend="italic">ãrchika.</hi> The second part contains the texts of the sãman-hymns, arranged in the order in which they are actually required for the stotras or chants of the various Soma sacrifices. The first part, on the other hand, contains the body of tune-verses, or verses used for practising the several sãmans or tunes upon—the tunes themselves being given in the <hi rend="italic">Grãma-geya-gāna (i.e.</hi> songs to be sung in the village), the tune-book specially belonging to the Pürvãrchika. Hence the latter includes all the first verses of those triplets of the second part which had special tunes peculiar to them, besides the texts of detached sãmans occasionally used outside the regular ceremonial, as well as such as were perhaps</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0164" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0181.jp2"/><p>no longer required but had been so used at one time or other. The verses of the Pūrvārchika are arranged on much the same plan as the family-books of the Ṛik-saṃhitā, viz. in three sections containing the verses addressed to Agni, Indra and Soma (<hi rend="italic">pavamāna</hi>)respectively—each section (consisting of one, three, and one adhyãyas respectively) being again arranged according to the metres. Hence this part is also called <hi rend="italic">Chhandas-</hi> (metre) <hi rend="italic">ärchika.</hi> Over and above this natural arrangement of the two ārchikas, there is a purely formal division of the texts into six and nine prapāṭhakas respectively, each of which, in the first part, consists of ten decades (daśat) of verses. We have two recensions of the Saiphitã, belonging to the Rāṇāyanīya and Kauthuma schools, the latter of which is but imperfectly known, but seems to have differed but slightly from the other. Besides the six prapāṭhakas (or five adhyāyas) of the Pürvãrchika, some schools have an additional “ forest ’’ chapter, called the <hi rend="italic">Āraṇyaka-saṃhitā,</hi> the tunes of which—along with others apparently intended for being chanted by anchorites—are partly contained in the <hi rend="italic">Aranya-gãna.</hi> Besides the two tune-books belonging to the Pūrvārchika, there are two others, the <hi rend="italic">Ūha-gāna</hi> (“ modification-songs ”) and <hi rend="italic">Uhya-gāna,</hi> which follow the order of the Uttarãrchika, giving the several sāman-hymns chanted at the Soma sacrifice, with the modifications the tunes undergo when applied to texts other than those for which they were originally composed. The Sãman hymnal, as it has come down to us, has evidently passed through a long course of development. The practice of chanting probably goes back to very early times; but the question whether any of the tunes, as given in the Gānas, and which of them, can lay claim to an exceptionally high antiquity will perhaps never receive a satisfactory answer.</p><p>The title of <hi rend="italic">Brährnana</hi> is bestowed by the Chhandogas, or followers of the Sāmaveda, on a considerable number of treatises. In accordance with the statements of some later writers, their number was usually fixed at eight; but within the last few years one new Brāhmaṇa has been recovered, while at least two others which are found quoted may yet be brought to light in India. The majority of the Sāmaveda-brāhmaṇas present, however, none of the characteristic features of other works of that class; but they are rather of the nature of sūtras and kindred treatises, with which they probably belong to the same period of literature. Moreover, the contents of these works—as might indeed be expected from the nature of the duties of the priests for whom they were intended—are of an extremely arid and technical character, though they all are doubtless of some importance, either for the textual criticism of the Saṃhitā or on account of the legendary and other information they supply.

Tradition ascribes the foundation of the Yajurveda to the sage Vaisampãyana. Of his disciples three are specially named, viz. Kaṭha, Kalāpin and Yãska Paingi, the last of whom again is stated to have communicated the sacrificial science to Tittiri.

The Kaṭhas and Kãlãpas are often referred to under the collective name of Charakas, which apparently means “wayfarers” or itinerant scholars; but according to a later writer (Hemachandra) Charaka is no other than Vaiśampāyana himself, after whom his followers would have been thus called. From the Kaṭhas proper two or three schools seem early to have branched off, the Prāchya- (eastern) Kaṭhas and the Kapishṭhala-Kaṭhas, the text-recension of the latter of whom has recently been discovered in the <hi rend="italic">Kapishthala-katha-saṃhitā,</hi> and probably also the Chārāyaṇīya-Kaṭhas The Kālāpas also soon became sub-divided into numerous different schools. Thus from one of Kalāpin’s immediate disciples, Haridru, the Hãridravïyas took their origin, whose text-recension, the <hi rend="italic">Häridravika,</hi> is quoted together with the Kāṭhaka. as early as in Yāska’s Nirukta; but we do not know whether it differed much from the original Kãlãpa texts. As regards the Taittirīya-saṃhitā, that collection, too, in course of time gave rise to a number of different schools, the text handed down being that of the Ãpastambas; while the contents of another recension, that of the Ātreyas, are known from their Anukramaṇi, which has been preserved.</p><p>The four collections of old Yajus texts, so far known to us, while differing more or less considerably in arrangement and verbal points, have the main mass of their textual matter in common. This common matter consists of both sacrificial prayers (yajus) in verse and prose, and exegetic or illustrative prose portions (brãh-maṇa). A prominent feature of the old Yajus texts, as compared with the other Vedas, is the constant intermixture of textual and exegetic portions. The Charakas and Taittirīyas thus do not recognize the distinction between Saṃhitā and Brāhmaṇa in the sense of two separate collections of texts, but they have only a Saṃhitā, or collection, which includes likewise the exegetic or Brāhmaṇa portions. The Taittirîyas seem at last to have been impressed with their want of a separate Brāhmaṇa and to have set about supplying the deficiency in rather an awkward fashion: instead of separating from each other the textual and exegetic por-tions of their Saṃhitā, they merely added to the latter a supplement (in three books), which shows the same mixed condition, and applied to it the title of <hi rend="italic">Taittirīya-brāhmaṇa.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="39"> Edited, with Sāyaṇa’s commentary, by Rājendralāla Mitra, <hi rend="italic">Bibl.

The reputed originator of this school and its text-recension is Yājña-valkya Vājasaneya (son of Vājasani). The result of the rearrangement of the texts was a collection of sacrificial mantras, the <hi rend="italic">Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā,</hi> and a Brāhmaṇa, the Ś <hi rend="italic">atapatha.</hi> On account of the greater lucidity of this arrangement, the Vãjasaneyins called their texts the White (or clear) Yajurveda—the name of Black (or obscure) Yajus being for opposite reasons applied to the Charaka texts. Both the Sarphitã and Brāhmaṇa of the Vājasaneyins have come down to us in two different recensions, viz. those of the <hi rend="italic">Mãdhyandina</hi> and <hi rend="italic">K</hi> <hi rend="italic">āṇva</hi> schools; and we find besides a considerable number of quotations from a Vājasaneyaka, from which we cannot doubt that there must have been at least one other recension of the Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa. The difference between the two extant recensions is, on the whole, but slight as regards the subject-matter; but in point of diction it is quite sufficient to make a comparison especially interesting from a philological point of view. Which of the two versions may be the more original cannot as yet be determined; but the phonetic and grammatical differences will probably have to be accounted for by a geographical separation of the two schools rather than by a difference of age. In several points of difference the Kāṇva recension agrees with the practice of the Ṛik-saṃhitā, and there probably was some connexion between the Yajus school of Kānvas and the famous family of ṛishis of that</p><p>name to which the eighth maṇḍala of the Ṛik is attributed.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Vājasaneyi-saṃhitā</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="44"> Edited in the Mãdhyandina recension, with the commentary of Mahïdhara, and the <hi rend="italic">vv. ll.</hi> of the Kāṇva text, by A.

The last fifteen adhyāyas are doubtless a later addition—as may also be the case as regards the preceding seven chapters.

The sacrificial texts of the Adhvaryus consist, in about equal parts, of verses (rich) and prose formulas (yajus). The majority of the former occur likewise in the Rik-saṃhitā, from which they were doubtless extracted. Not infrequently, however, they show considerable discrepancies of reading, which may be explained partly from a difference of recension and partly as the result of the adaptation of these verses to their special sacrificial purpose. As regards the prose formulas, though only a few of them are actually referred to in the Rik, it is quite possible that many of them may be of high antiquity. *</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Śatapatha-brāhmaṇa,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="46"> Edited by A. Weber, who also translated the first chapter into German. English translation (5 vols.) by J. Eggeling, in <hi rend="italic">S. B.

The first nine books of the former, corresponding to the first eleven of the Kāṇvas, and consisting of sixty adhyãyas, form a kind of running commentary on the first eighteen books of the Vāj.-Saṃhitā; and it has been plausibly suggested by Professor Weber that this portion of the Brāhmaṇa may be referred to in the Mahābhāshya on Pāṇ. iv. 2, 60, where a Śatapatha and</p><p>a Shashṭi-patha (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> “ consisting of 60 paths ”) are mentioned together as objects of study, and that consequently it may at one time have formed an independent work. This view is also supported by the circumstance that of the remaining five books (10-14) of the Mādhyandinas the third is called the middle one (madhyama); while the Kāṇvas apply the same epithet to the middlemost of the five books (12-16) preceding their last one. This last book would thus seem to be treated by them as a second supplement, and not without reason, as it is of the Upanishad order, and bears the special title of <hi rend="italic">Bzihad-</hi> (great) <hi rend="italic">äranyaka</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="47"> The text, with Sankara’s commentary, and an English translation, published by E.

Except in books 6-10 (M.), which treat of the construction of fire-altars, and recognize the sage Sãnçlilya as their chief authority, Yājñavalkya’s opinion is frequently referred to in the Śatapatha as authoritative. This is especially the case in the later books, part of the Bphad-āraṇyaka being even called Yājñavalkīya-kāṇḍa. As regards the age of the Śatapatha, the probability is that the main body of the work is considerably older than the time of Pāṇini, but that some of its latter parts were considered by Pāṇini’s critic Kātyāvana to be of about the same age as, or not much older than, Pāṇini. Even those portions had probably been long in existence before they obtained recognition as part of the canon of the White Yajus.</p><p>The contemptuous manner in which the doctrines of the Charaka-adhvaryus are repeatedly animadverted upon in the Śatapatha betrays not a little of the <hi rend="italic">odium theologicum</hi> on the part of the divines of the Vãjasaneyins towards their brethren of the older schools. Nor was their animosity confined to mere literary warfare, but they seem to have striven by every means to gain ascendancy over their rivals. The consolidation of the Brāhmanical hierarchy and the institution of a common system of ritual worship, which called forth the liturgical Vedic collections, were doubtless consummated in the so-called Madhya-deśa, or “ midland,” lying between the Sarasvatī and the confluence of the Yamunā and Gangā; and more especially in its western part, the Kuru-kshetra, or land of the Kurus, with the adjoining territory of the Panchālas, between the Yamunã and Gangã. From thence the original schools of Vaidik ritualism gradually extended their sphere over the adjacent parts. The Charakas seem for a long time to have held sway in the western and north-western regions; while the Taittirīyas in course of time spread over the whole of the peninsula south of the Narmadā (Nerbudda), where their ritual has remained pre-eminently the object of study till comparatively recent times. The Vãjasaneyins, on the other hand, having first gained a footing in the lands on the lower Ganges, chiefly, it would seem, through the patronage of King Janaka of Videha, thence gradually worked their way westwards, and eventually succeeded in superseding the older schools north of the Vindhya, with the exception of some isolated places where even now families of Brahmans are met with which profess to follow the old Sarphitãs.</p><p>In <hi rend="italic">Kalpa-sūtras</hi> the Black Yajurveda is particularly rich ; but, owing to the circumstances jus indicated, they are almost entirely confined to the Taittirīya school.

As regards the former work, it is still doubtful whether (with Weber) we have to consider it as older than Pāṇini, or whether (with Gold-stücker and M.

That it is also the youngest Veda is proved by its language, which both from a lexical and a grammatical point of view, marks an intermediate stage between the main body of the Ṛik and the Brāhmaṇa period. In regard also to the nature of its contents, and the spirit which pervades them, this Vedic collection occupies a position apart from the others. Whilst the older Vedas seem clearly to reflect the recognized religious notions and practices of the upper, and so to speak, respectable classes of the Aryan tribes, as jealously watched over by a priesthood deeply interested in the undiminished, maintenance of the traditional observances, the fourth Veda, on the other hand, deals mainly with all manner of superstitious practices such as have at all times found a fertile soil in the lower strata of primitive and less advanced peoples, and are even apt, below the surface, to maintain their tenacious hold on the popular mind in comparatively civilized communities. Though the constant intermingling with the aboriginal tribes may well be believed to have exercised a deteriorating influence on the Vedic people in this respect, it can scarcely be doubted that superstitious practices of the kind revealed by the Atharvan and the tenth book of the Ṛik must at all times have obtained amongst the Aryan people, and that they only came to the surface when they received the stamp of recognized forms of popular belief by the admission of these collections of spells and incantations into</p><p>the sacred canon. If in this phase of superstitious belief the old gods still find a place, their character has visibly changed so as to be more in accordance with those mystic rites and magic performances and the part they are called upon to play in them, as the promoters of the votary’s cabalistic practices and the averters of the malicious designs of mortal enemies and the demoniac influences to which he would ascribe his fears and failures as well as his bodily ailments. The fourth Veda may thus be said to supplement in a remarkable manner the picture of the domestic life of the Vedic Āryan as presented in the Gṛihya-sūtras or house rules; for whilst these deal only with the orderly aspects of the daily duties and periodic observances in the life of the respectable householder, the Atharvaveda allows us a deep insight into “ the obscurer relations and emotions of human life"; and, it may with truth be said that “ the literary diligence of the Hindus has in this instance preserved a document of priceless value for the institutional history of early India as well as for the ethnological history of the human race ” (M. Bloomfield), It is worthy of note that the Atharvaveda is practically unknown in the south of India.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="63"> A. Burnell, <hi rend="italic">Classif. Index of Tanjore Sansk.

The two families or classes of priests are by tradition connected with the service of the sacred fire; but whilst the Atharvans seem to have devoted themselves to the auspicious aspects of the fire-cult and the per-formance of propitiatory rites, the Angiras, on the other hand, are represented as having been mainly engaged in the uncanny practices of sorcery and exorcism. Instead of the Atharvans, another mythic family, the Bhṛigus, are similarly connected with the Angiras (Bhṛigvangirasas) as the depositaries of this mystic science. In course of time the lore of the Atharvans came also to have applied to it the title of <hi rend="italic">Brahmaveda;</hi> a designation which was apparently meant to be understood both in the sense of the Veda of the Brahman priest or superintendent of the sacrifice, and in that of the lore of the Brahma or sacred (magic) word, and the supreme deity it is supposed to embody.

The whole mass is divided into twenty books. The principle of distribution is for the most part a merely formal one, in books i.-xiii. pieces of the same or about the same number of verses being placed together in the same book. The next five books, xiv.-xviii., have each its own special subject: xiv. treats of marriage and sexual union ; xv., in prose, of the Vrãtya, or religious vagrant; xvi. consists chiefly of prose formulas of conjuration; xvii. of a lengthy mystic hymn; and xviii. contains all that relates to death and funeral rites. Of the last two books no account is taken in the Atharva-prātiśākhya, and they indeed stand clearly in the relation of supplements to the original collection. The nineteenth book evidently was the result of a subsequent gleaning of pieces similar to those of the earlier books, which had probably escaped the collectors’ attention; while the last book, consisting almost entirely of hymns to Indra, taken from the Ṛik-saṃhitā, is nothing more than a liturgical manual of recitations and chants required at the Soma sacrifice; its only original portion being the ten so-called <hi rend="italic">kuntāpa</hi> hymns (127-136), consisting partly of laudatory recitals of generous patrons of sacrificial priests and partly of riddles and didactic subjects.</p><p>The Atharvan has come down to us in a much less satisfactory state of preservation than any of the other Saṃhitās, and its inter-pretation, which offers considerable difficulties on account of numerous popular and out-of-the-way expressions, has so far received comparatively little aid from native sources. Less help, in this respect, than might have been expected, is afforded by a recently published commentary professing to have been composed by Sāyaṇa Āchārya; serious doubts have indeed been thrown on the authenticity of its ascription to the famous Vedic exegetic. Of very considerable importance, on the other hand, was the discovery in Kashmir of a second recension of the Atharva-saiphitã, contained in a single birch-bark MS., written in the Śāradā character, and lately made available by an excellent chromo-photographic reproduction. This new recension,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="65"> The first account of a copy of it was given by Professor R. v.

The twentieth book is wanting, with the exception of a few of the verses not taken from the Ṛik. As a set-off to these shortcomings the new version offers, however, a good deal of fresh matter, amounting to about one-sixth of the whole. From the Mahābhāshya and other works quoting as the beginning of the Atharva-saṃhitā a verse that coincides with the first verse of the sixth hymn of the current text, it has long been known that at least one other recension must have existed; but the first leaf of the Kashmir MS. having been lost, it cannot be determined whether the new recension (as seems all but certain) corresponds to the one referred to in those works.</p><p>The only Brāhmaṇa of the Atharvan, the <hi rend="italic">Gopatha-brāhmaṇa,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="66"> Edited in the <hi rend="italic">Bibl.

Although Saunaka can hardly be credited with being the actual author of the work, considering that his opinion is rejected in the only rule where his name appears, there is no reason to doubt that it chiefly em-bodies the phonetic theories of that teacher, which were afterwards perfected by members of his school. Whether this Saunaka is identical with the writer of that name to whom the final redaction of the Sãkalaprãtisãkhya of the Rík is ascribed is not known; but it is worthy of note that on at least two points where Sãkalya is quoted by Pāṇini, the Chaturãdhyäyikã seems to be referred to rather than the Rik-prãtisãkhya. Saunaka is quoted once in the Vājasaneyi-prātiśākhya; and it is possible that Kãtyãyana had the Chaturãdhyãyikã in view, though hís reference does not quite tally</p><p>with the respective rule of that work.</p><p>Another class of writings already alluded to as traditionally connected with the Atharvaveda are the numerous <hi rend="italic">Upanishads</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="71"> For a full list of existing translations of and essays on the Upanishads, see lntrod. to Max Müller’s “ Upanishads,” <hi rend="italic">S.B.E.</hi> i.

The Ātharvaṇa-upanishads, mostly composed in ślokas, may be roughly divided into two classes, viz. those of a purely speculative or general pantheistic character, treating chiefly of the nature of the supreme spirit, and the means of attaining to union therewith, and those of a sectarian tendency. Of the former category, a limited number—such as the Praśna, Muṇḍaka, and Māṇḍūkya-upanishads —have probably to be assigned to the later period of Vedic literature ; whilst the others presuppose more or less distinctly the existence of some fully developed system of philosophy, especially the Vedãnta or the Yoga. The sectarian Upanishads, on the other hand— identifying the supreme spirit either with one of the forms of Vishṇu (such as the Nārāyaṇa, Nṛisiṃha-tāpanīya, Rāma-tāpanīya, Gopāla-tāpanīya Upanishads), or with Siva (<hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the Rudropanishad), or with</p><p>some other deity—belong to post-Vedic times.</p><p>2. The Classical Period</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Classical Literature of India</hi> is almost entirely a product of artificial growth, in the sense that its vehicle was not the language of the general body of the people, but of a small and educated class. It would scarcely be possible, even approximately, to fix the time when the literary idiom ceased to be understood by the common people. We only know that in the 3rd century b.c. there existed several dialects in different parts of northern India which differed considerably from the Sanskrit; and Buddhist tradition states that Gautama Śākyamuni himself, in the 6th century b.c., used the local dialect of Magadha (Behar) for preaching his new doctrine. Not unlikely, indeed, popular dialects, differing perhaps but slightly from one another, may have existed as early as the time of the Vedic hymns, when the Indo-Aryans, divided into clans and tribes, occupied the Land of the Seven Rivers; but such dialects must have sprung up after the extension of the Aryan sway and language over the whole breadth of northern India. But there is no reason why, even with the existence of local dialects, the literary language should not have kept in touch with the people in India, as elsewhere, save for the fact that from a certain time that language remained altogether stationary, allowing the vernacular dialects more and more to diverge from it. Although linguistic research had been successfully carried on in India for centuries, the actual grammatical fixation of Sanskrit seems to have taken place about contemporaneously with the first spread of Buddhism; and</p><p>indeed that popular religious movement undoubtedly exercised a powerful influence on the linguistic development of India.</p><p>A. <hi rend="italic">Poetical Literature.</hi></p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Epic Poems.—</hi> The Hindus, like the Greeks, possess two great national epics, the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">R</hi> <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> <hi rend="italic">m</hi> <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> <hi rend="italic">ya</hi> <hi rend="italic">ṇ</hi> <hi rend="italic">α.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="72"> Three complete Indian editions, the handiest in 4 vols., including the Harivaṃsa (Calcutta, 1834-1839); a Bombay edition, with Nīlakaṇṭha’s commentary (1863); and a third, in Telugu characters, containing the Southern recension (Madras, 1855-1860).

The authorship of this work is aptly attributed to Vyāsa, “ the arranger,” the personification of Indian diaskeuasis. Only the bare outline of the leading story can here be given.</p><p>In the royal line of Hastināpura (the ancient Delhi)—claiming descent from the moon, and hence called the Lunar race (soma-vaṃśa), and counting among its ancestors King Bharata, after whom India is called Bhārata-varsha (land of the Bhãratas)—the succession lay between two brothers, when Dhṛitarāshṭra, the elder, being blind, had to make way for his brother Pāṇḍu. After a time the latter retired to the forest to pass the remainder of his life in hunting; and Dhṛitarāshṭra assumed the government, assisted by his uncle Bhīshma, the Nestor of the poem. After some years Paṇḍu died, leaving five sons, viz. Yudhishṭhira, Bhīma and Arjuna by his chief wife Kuntī, and the twins Nakula and Sahadeva by Mādrī. The latter having burnt herself along with her dead husband, Kuntī returned with the five princes to Hastinãpura, and was well received by the king, who offered to have his nephews brought up together with his own sons, of whom he had a hundred, Duryodhana being the eldest. From their great-grandfather Kuru both families are called <hi rend="italic">Kauravas</hi>; but for distinction that name is more usually applied to the sons of Dhṛitarāshṭra, while their cousins, as the younger line, are named, after their father, <hi rend="italic">Pāṇḍavas.</hi> The rivalry and varying fortunes of these two houses form the main plot of the great epopee. The Pāṇḍu princes soon proved themselves greatly superior to their cousins; and Yudhishthira, the eldest of them all, was to be appointed heir-apparent. But, by his son’s advice, the king, good-natured but weak, induced his nephews for a time to retire from court and reside at a house where the unscrupulous Duryodhana meant to destroy them. They escaped, however, and passed some time in the forest with their mother. Here Draupadï, daughter of King Drupada of Panchãla, won by Arjuna in open contest, became the wife of the five brothers. On that occasion they also met their cousin, Kuntī’s nephew, the famous Yādava prince Kṛishṇa of Dvārakā, who ever afterwards remained their faithful friend and confidential adviser. Dhṛita-rāshṭra now resolved to divide the kingdom between the two houses ; whereupon the Pāṇḍavas built for themselves the city of Indraprastha (on the site of the modern Delhi). After a time of great prosperity, Yudhishṭhira, in a game of dice, lost everything to Duryodhana, when it was settled that the Pāṇḍavas should retire to the forest for twelve years, but should afterwards be restored to their kingdom if they succeeded in passing an additional year in disguise, without being recognized by any one. During their forest-life they met with many adventures, among which may be mentioned their encounter with King Jayadratha of Chedi, who had carried off Draupadî from their hermitage. After the twelfth year had expired they leave the forest, and, assuming various disguises, take service at the court of King Viräta of Matsya. Here all goes well for a time till the queen’s brother Kïchaka, a great warrior and commander of the royal forces, falls in love with Draupadï, and is slain by Bhïma. The Kauravas, profiting by Kīchaka’s death, now invade the Matsyan kingdom, when the Pāṇḍavas side with King Viräta, and there ensues, on the field of Kurukshetra, during eighteen days, a series of fierce battles, ending in the annihilation of the Kauravas. Yudhishṭhira now at last becomes vuva-rãja, and eventually king— Dhṛitarāshtra having resigned and retired with his wife and Kuntī to the forest, where they soon after perish in a conflagration. Learning also the death of Krishna, Yudhishṭhira himself at last becomes tired of life and resigns his crown; and the five princes, with their faithful wife, and a dog that joins them, set out for Mount Meru, to seek admission to Indra’s heaven. On the way one by one drops off, till Yudhishṭhira alone, with the dog, reaches the gate of heaven; but, the dog being refused admittance, the king declines entering</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0168" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0185.jp2"/><p>without it, when the dog turns out to be no other than the god of Justice himself, having assumed that form to test Yudhishṭhira’s constancy. But, finding neither his wife nor his brothers in heaven, and being told that they are in the nether world to expiate their sins, the king insists on sharing their fate, when this, too, proves a trial, and they are all reunited to enjoy perpetual bliss.</p><p>The complete work consists of upwards of 100,000 couplets— its contents thus being nearly eight times the bulk of the <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Odyssey</hi> combined. It is divided into eighteen books, and a supplement, entitled Harivaṃśa, or genealogy of the god Hari (Kṛishṇa-Vishṇu). In the introduction, Vyāsa, being about to dictate the poem, is made to say (i. 81) that so far he and some of his disciples knew 8800 couplets; and farther on (i. 101) he is said to have composed the collection relating to the Bhāratas (<hi rend="italic">bhārata-saṃhitā</hi>), and called the <hi rend="italic">Bhãratam,</hi> which, hot including the episodes, consisted of 24,ooo slokas. Now, as a matter of fact, the portion relating to the feud of the rival houses constitutes somewhere between a fourth and a fifth of the work; and it is by no means improbable that this portion once formed a separate poem, called the <hi rend="italic">Bhärata.</hi> But, whether the former statement is to be understood as implying the existence, at a still earlier time, of a yet shorter version of about one-third of the present extent of the leading narrative, cannot now be determined. While some of the episodes are so loosely connected with the story as to be readily severed from it, others are so closely interwoven with it that their removal would seriously injure the very texture of the work. This, however, only shows that the original poem must have undergone some kind of revision, or perhaps repeated revisions. That such has indeed taken place, at the hand of Brahmans, for sectarian and caste purposes, cannot be doubted. According to Lassen’s opinion,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="73"> Lassen, <hi rend="italic">Indische Altertumskunde,</hi> i. 733 sqq. </note> which has been very generally accepted by scholars, the main story of the poem would be based on historical events, viz. on a destructive war waged between the two neighbouring peoples of the Kurus and Pan-chälas, who occupied the western and eastern parts of the Madhyadeśa (or “ middle land ” between the Ganges and Jumna) respectively, and ending in the overthrow of the Kuru dynasty. On the original accounts of these events—perhaps handed down in the form of lays or sagas—the Pāṇḍava element would subsequently have been grafted as calculated to promote the class interests of the Brāhmanical revisers. It is certainly a strange coincidence that the five Pāṇḍava princes should have taken to wife the daughter of the king of the Panchãlas, and thus have linked their fortunes to a people which is represented, in accordance with its name, to have consisted of five (pancha) tribes.</p><p>The earliest direct information regarding the existence of epic poetry in India is contained in a passage of Dion Chrysostom (c. A.D. 80), according to which “ even among the Indians, they say, Homer’s poetry is sung, having been translated by them into their own dialect and tongue ”; and “ the Indians are well acquainted with the sufferings of Priam, the lamentations and wails of Andromache and Hecuba, and the prowess of Achilles and Hector.” Now, although these allusions would suit either poem, they seem to correspond best to certain incidents in the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata,</hi> especially as no direct mention is made of a warlike expedition to a remote island for the rescue of an abducted woman, the resemblance of which to the Trojan expedition would naturally have struck a Greek becoming acquainted with the general outline of the <hi rend="italic">Rāmāyaṇa.</hi> Whence Dion derived his information is not known; but as many leading names of the Mahābhãrata and even the name of the poem itself<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="74"> Viz. as an adj., apparently with “ war ” or “ poem ” understood. </note> are mentioned in Pāṇini’s grammatical rules, not only must the Bhārata legend have been current in his time (? <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 400 B.C.), but most probably it existed already in poetical form, as undoubtedly it did at the time of Patanjali, the author of the “ great commentary ” on Pāṇini (<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 150 b.c.). The great epic is also mentioned, both as <hi rend="italic">Bhärata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Mahābhārata,</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Gṛihya-sūtra</hi> of Āśvalāyana, whom Lassen supposes to have lived about 350 b.c. Nevertheless it must remain uncertain whether the poem was then already in the form in which we</p><p>now have it, at least as far as the leading story and perhaps some of the episodes are concerned, a large portion of the episodical matter being clearly of later origin. It cannot, however, be doubted that long before that time heroic song had been diligently cultivated in India at the courts of princes and among Kshatriyas, the knightly order, generally. In the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> itself the transmission of epic legend is in some way connected with the Sūtas, a social class which, in the caste-system, is defined as resulting from the union of Kshatriya men with Brāhmaṇa women, and which supplied the office of charioteers and heralds, as well as (along with the Mãgadhas) that of professional minstrels. Be this as it may, there is reason to believe that, as Hellas had her <hi rend="italic">άοιδοί</hi> who sang the <hi rend="italic">κλέα άνδρων,</hi> and Iceland her skalds who recited favourite sagas, so India had from olden times her professional bards, who delighted to sing the praises of kings and inspire the knights with warlike feelings. If in this way a stock of heroic poetry had gradually accumulated which reflected an earlier state of society and manners, we can well understand why, after the Brãhmanical order of things had been definitely established, the priests should have deemed it desirable to subject these traditional memorials of Kshatriya chivalry and prestige to their own censorship, and adapt them to their own canons of religious and civil law. Such a revision would doubtless require considerable skill and tact; and if in the present version of the work much remains that seems contrary to the Brāhmanical code and pretensions— <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the polyandric union of Draupadī and the Pāṇḍu princes—the reason probably is that such features were too firmly rooted in the popular tradition to be readily eliminated; and all the revisers could do was to explain them away as best they could. Thus Draupadī’s abnormal position is actually accounted for in five different ways, one of these representing it as an act of duty and filial obedience on the part of Arjuna who, on bringing home his fair prize and announcing it to his mother, is told by her, before seeing what it is, to share it with his brothers. Nay, it has even been seriously argued that the Brãhmanical editors have completely changed the traditional relations of the leading characters of the story. For, although the Pāṇḍavas and their cousin Kṛishṇa are constantly extolled as models of virtue and goodness, while the Kauravas and their friend Karṇa—a son of the sun-god, borne by Kuntï before her marriage with Pāṇḍu, and brought up secretly as the son of a Sūta—are decried as monsters of depravity, these estimates of the heroes’ characters are not unfrequently belied by their actions—especially the honest Karṇa and the brave Duryodhana (<hi rend="italic">i.e. “</hi> the bad fighter,” but formerly called Suyo-dhana, “ the good fighter ’’) contrasting not unfavourably with the wily Kṛishṇa and the cautious and somewhat effeminate Yudhishṭhira. These considerations, coupled with certain peculiarities on the part of the Kauravas, apparently suggestive of an original connexion of the latter with Buddhist institutions, have led Dr Holtzmann to devise an ingenious theory, viz. that the traditional stock of legends was first worked up into a connected narrative by some Buddhist poet—most likely at the time of the emperor Aśoka (c. 250 B.c.), whom the Kaurava hero Suyodhana might even seem to have been intended to represent—and that this poem, showing a decided predilection for the Kuru party as the representatives of Buddhist principles, was afterwards revised in a contrary sense, at the time of the Brãhmanical reaction, by votaries of Vishṇu, when the Buddhist features were generally modified into Śaivite tendencies, and prominence was given to the divine nature of Kṛishṇa, as an incarnation of Vishṇu. As this theory would, however, seem to involve the Brãhmanical revision of the poem having taken place subsequent to the decline of Buddhist predominance, it would shift the completion of the work to a considerably later date than would be consistent with other evidence. From inscriptions we know that by the end of the 5th century a.d. the Mahãbhãrata was appealed to as an authority on matters of law, and that its extent was practically what it now is, including its supplement, the Harivaṃśa. Indeed, everything seems to point to the probability of the work having been complete by about A.D. 200. But, whilst Bhãrata and Kuru heroic lays may, and probably</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0169" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0186.jp2"/><p>do, go back to a much earlier age, it seems hardly possible to assume that the Pāṇḍava epic in its present form can have been composed before the Greek invasion of India, or about 300 b.c. Moreover, it is by no means impossible that the epic narrative was originally composed—as some other portions of the works are—in prose, either continuous or mixed with snatches of verse. Nay, in the opinion of some scholars, this poem (as well as the Rãmãyana) may even have been originally composed in some popular dialect, which would certainly best account for the irregular and apparently prākritic or dialectic forms in which these works abound. The leading position occupied in the exist-ing epic by Kṛishṇa (whence it is actually called <hi rend="italic">k</hi> <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> <hi rend="italic">rsh</hi> <hi rend="italic">ṇ</hi> <hi rend="italic">a veda,</hi> or the veda of Kṛishṇa), and the Vaishṇava spirit pervading it, make it very probable that it assumed its final form under the influence of the Bhāgavata sect with whom Vāsudeva (Kṛishṇa), originally apparently a venerated local hero, came to he regarded as a veritable god, and incarnation of Vishṇu. Its culminating point this sectarian feature attains in the <hi rend="italic">Bhagavad-g</hi> <hi rend="italic">ītā</hi> <hi rend="italic"/>(<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the upanishad), “ sung by the holy one ”—the famous theosophic episode, in which Krishna, in lofty and highly poetic language, expounds the doctrine of faith (bhakti) and claims adoration as the incarnation of the supreme spirit. Of the purely legendary matter incorporated with the leading story of the poem, not a little, doubtless, is at least as old as the latter itself. Some of these episodes—especially the well-known story of Nala and Damayantï, and the touching legend of Sāvitrī—form themselves little epic gems of considerable poetic value.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Rämäyana, i.e.</hi> poem “ relating to Rāma,” is ascribed to the poet Vālmīki; and, allowance being made for some later additions, the poem indeed presents the appearance of being the work of an individual genius. In its present form it consists of some 24,000 ślokas, or 48,000 lines of sixteen syllables, divided into seven books.</p><p>(I.) King Daśaratha of Kośala, reigning at Ayodhyā (Oudh), has four sons borne him by three wives, viz. Rãma, Bharata and the twins Lakshmaṇa and Śatrughna. Rãma, by being able to bend an enormous bow, formerly the dreaded weapon of the god Rudra, wins for a wife Sītā, daughter of Janaka, king of Videha (Tirhut). (IL) On his return to Ayodhyã he is to be appointed heir-apparent (yuva-rãja, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> juvenis rex); but Bharata’s mother persuades the king to banish his eldest son for fourteen years to the wilderness, and appoint her son instead. Separation from his favourite son soon breaks the king’s heart; whereupon the ministers call on Bharata to assume the reins of government. He refuses, however, and, betaking himself to Rama’s retreat on the Chitraküta mountain (in Bundelkhund), implores him to return; but, unable to shake Rama’s resolve to complete his term of exile, he consents to take charge of the kingdom in the meantime. (III.) After a ten years’ residence in the forest, Rãma attracts the attention of a female demon (rākshasī); and, infuriated by the rejection of her advances, and by the wounds inflicted on her by Lakshmaṇa, who keeps Rãma company, she inspires her brother Rāvaṇa, demon-king of Ceylon, with love for Sïtã, in consequence of which the latter is carried off by him to his capital Lankā. While she resolutely rejects the Rãkshasa’s addresses, Rãma sets out with his brother to her rescue. (IV.) After numerous adventures they enter into an alliance with Sugrîva, king of the monkeys; and, with the assistance of the monkey-general Hanumān, and Rāvaṇa’s own brother Vibhīshaṇa, they prepare to assault Lankā. (V.) The monkeys, tearing up rocks and trees, construct a passage across the straits— the so-called Adam’s Bridge, still designated Rãma’s Bridge in India. (VI.) Having crossed over with his allies, Rãma, after many hot encounters and miraculous deeds, slays the demon and captures the stronghold; whereupon he places Vibhīshaṇa on the throne of Lankā. To allay Rāma’s misgivings as to any taint she might have incurred through contact with the demon, Sïtã now successfully undergoes an ordeal by fire; after which they return to Ayodhyã, where, after a triumphal entry, Rãma is installed. (VII.) Rāma, how-ever, seeing that the people are not yet satisfied of Sîtã’s purity, resolves to put her away; whereupon, in the forest, she falls in with Vālmīki himself, and at his hermitage gives birth to two sons. While growing up there, they are taught by the sage the use of the bow, as well as the Vedas, and the Rãmãyana as far as the capture of Lankã and the royal entry into Ayodhyã. Ultimately Rãma discovers and recognizes them by their wonderful deeds and their likeness to himself, and takes his wife and sons back with him.</p><p>The last book, as will be noticed from this bare outline, presents a somewhat strange appearance. There can be little doubt that it is a later addition to the work; and the same is apparently the case as regards the first book, with the exception of certain portions which would seem to have formed the beginning of the original poem. In these two books the character of Rãma appears changed: he has become deified and identified with the god Vishṇu, whilst in the body of the poem his character is simply that of a perfect man and model hero. As regards the general idea underlying the leading story, whilst the first part of the narrative can hardly he said to differ materially from other historical and knightly romances, the second part—the expedition to Lankã—on the other hand has called forth different theories, without, however, any general agreement having so far been arrived at. Whilst Lassen and Weber would see in this warlike expedition a poetical representation of the spread of Aryan rule and civilization over southern India, Talboys Wheeler took the demons of Lankã, against whom Rāma’s campaign is directed, to be intended for the Buddhists of Ceylon. More recently, again, Professor Jacobi<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="75"> <hi rend="italic">Das Rāmāyaṇa</hi> (Bonn, 1893). </note> of Bonn has endeavoured to prove that the poem has neither an allegorical nor a religious tendency, but that its background is a purely mythological one— Rāma representing the god Indra, and Sïtã—in accordance with the meaning of the name—the personified “ Furrow,” as which she is already invoked in the Rigveda, and hence is a tutelary spirit of the tilled earth, wedded to Indra, the Jupiter Pluvius. Moreover, from a comparison of the narrative of the poem with a popular version of it, contained in one of the Pali “ birth-stories,” the Dasaratha-jātaka, which lacks the second part of the story, Professor Weber tried to show that the expedition of Lankã cannot have formed part of the original epic, but was probably based on some general acquaintance with the Troy legend of Greek poetry.</p><p>A remarkable feature of this poem is the great variation of its textual condition in different parts of the country, amounting in fact to at least three different recensions. The text most widely prevalent both in the north and south has been printed repeatedly, with commentary, at Bombay, and was taken by Mr R. T. H. Griffith as the basis for his beautiful poetical transla-tion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="76"> London, 1870-1874; there is also an English prose translation by M. N. Dutt (Calcutta, 1894) ; and a condensed version in English verse by Romesh Dutt (London, 1899). </note> The so-called Gauḍa or Bengal recension, on the other hand, which differs most of all, has been edited, with an Italian prose translation, by G. Gorresio;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="77"> Turin, 1843-1867. </note> whilst the third recension, recognized chiefly in Kashmir and western India, is so far known only from manuscripts. The mutual relation of these versions will appear from the fact that about one-third of the matter of each recension is not found in the other two; whilst in the common portions, too, there are great variations both in regard to the order of verses and to textual readings. To account for this extraordinary textual diversity, it has been suggested that the poem was most likely originally composed in a popular dialect, and was thence turned into Sanskrit by different hands trying to improve on one another; whilst Professor Jacobi would rather ascribe the difference to the fact that the poem was for a long time handed down orally in Sanskrit by rhap-sodists, or professional minstrels, when such variations might naturally arise in different parts of the country. Yet another version of the same story, with, however, many important variations of details, forms an episode of the <hi rend="italic">Mah</hi> <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> <hi rend="italic">bh</hi> <hi rend="italic">ā</hi> <hi rend="italic">rata,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Rämopäkhyäna,</hi> the relation of which to Vālmīki’s work is still a matter of uncertainty. In respect of both versification and diction the Rāmāyaṇa is of a distinctly more refined character than the larger poem; and, indeed, Vãlmïki is seen already to cultivate some of that artistic style of poetry which was carried to excess in the later artificial Kāvyas, whence the title of ā <hi rend="italic">di-kavi</hi>, or first poet, is commonly applied to him. Though the political conditions reflected in the older parts of the Rāmāyaṇa seem to correspond best to those of pre-Buddhistic times, this might after all only apply to the poetic material handed down orally and eventually cast into its present form. To characterize the Indian epics in a single word: though often disfigured by grotesque fancies and wild exaggerations, they are yet noble works, abounding in passages of remarkable descriptive power,</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0170" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0187.jp2"/><p>intense pathos, and high poetic grace and beauty; and while, as works of art, they are far inferior to the Greek epics, in some respects they appeal far more strongly to the romantic mind of Europe, namely, by their loving appreciation of natural beauty, their exquisite delineation of womanly love and devotion, and their tender sentiment of mercy and forgiveness.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Pur</hi> <hi rend="italic">āṇ</hi> <hi rend="italic">as and Tantras.—</hi> The <hi rend="italic">Pur</hi> <hi rend="italic">āṇ</hi> <hi rend="italic">as</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="78"> <hi rend="italic"/>@@@ <hi rend="italic">Cf.</hi> H.

They are sometimes styled a fifth Veda, and may indeed in a certain sense be looked upon as the scriptures of Brãhmanical India. The term <hi rend="italic">pur</hi> <hi rend="italic">āṇ</hi> <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> signifying “ old,” applied originally to prehistoric, especially cosmogonic, legends, and then to collections of ancient traditions generally. The existing works of this class, though recognizing the Brāhmanical doctrine of the Trimürti, or triple manifestation of the deity (in its creative, preservative and destructive activity), are all of a sectarian tendency, being intended to establish, on quasi-historic grounds, the claims of some special god, or holy place, on the devotion of the people. For this purpose the compilers have pressed into their service a mass of extraneous didactic matter on all manner of subjects, whereby these works had become a kind of popular encyclopaedias of useful knowledge. It is evident, however, from a comparatively early definition given of the typical Purāṇa, as well as from numerous coincidences of the existing works, that they are based on, or enlarged from, older works of this kind, more limited in their scope and probably of a more decidedly tritheistic tendency of belief. Thus none of the Purāṇas, as now extant, is probably much above a thousand years old, though a considerable proportion of their materials is doubtless much older, and may perhaps</p><p>in part go back to several centuries before the Christian era.</p><p>In legendary matter the Purāṇas have a good deal in common with the epics, especially the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata—</hi> the compilers or revisers of both classes of works having evidently drawn their materials from the same fluctuating mass of popular traditions. They are almost entirely composed in the epic couplet, and indeed in much the same easy flowing style as the epic poems, to which they are, however, as a rule greatly inferior in poetic value.</p><p>According to the traditional classification of these works, there are said to be eighteen (<hi rend="italic">Mahā</hi>-, or great) <hi rend="italic">Purāṇas,</hi> and as many <hi rend="italic">Upa-purāṇas,</hi> or subordinate Purāṇas. The former are by some authorities divided into three groups of six, according as one or other of the three primary qualities of external existence—goodness, darkness (ignorance), and passion—is supposed to prevail in them, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Vishṇu, Nāradīya, Bhāgavata, Garuḍa, Padma, Varāha— Matsya, Kūrma, Linga, Siva, Skanda, Agni—Brahmāṇḍa, Brahmavaivarta, Mārkaṇḍeya, Bhavishya, Vāmana</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Brahma-Purāṇas.</hi> In accordance with the nature of the several forms of the Trimürti, the first two groups chiefly devote themselves to the commendation of Vishṇu Siva respectively, whilst the third group, which would properly belong to Brahman, has been largely appropriated for the promotion of the claims of other deities, viz. Vishṇu in his sensuous form of Krishṇa, Devī, Gaṇeśa, and Sūrya. As Professor Banerjea has shown in his preface to the <hi rend="italic">Mārkaṇḍeya,</hi> this seems to have been chiefly effected by later additions and interpolations. The insufficiency of the above classification, however, appears even from the fact that it omits the <hi rend="italic">Vāyu-purāṇa,</hi> probably one of the oldest of all, though some MSS. substitute it for one or other name of the second group.

MSS.</hi> ii. 47. </note> that what he wrote was a synopsis of the Purāṇa, and that the latter is already quoted in a work by Ballãla Sena of Bengal, in the 11th century. It is certainly held in the highest estimation, and, especially through the vernacular</p><p>versions of its tenth book, treating of the story of Krishṇa, has powerfully influenced the religious belief of India.</p><p>From the little we know regarding the Upa-purāṇas, their char-acter does not seem to differ very much from that of the principal sectarian Purãnas. Besides these two classes of works there is a large number of so-called <hi rend="italic">Sthala-purāṇas,</hi> or chronicles recounting the history and merits of some holy “ place ” or shrine, where their recitation usually forms an important part of the daily service. Of much the same nature are the numerous <hi rend="italic">Mähãtmyas</hi> (literally “ relating to the great spirit ”), which usually profess to be sections of one or other Purāṇa. Thus the <hi rend="italic">Devī-māhātmya,</hi> which celebrates the victories of the great “goddess ” over the Asuras, and is daily read at the temples of that deity, forms a section, though doubtless an interpolated one, of the Mārkaṇḍeya-purāṇa.

These works are looked upon as their sacred writings by the numerousŚā <hi rend="italic">ktas,</hi> or worshippers of the female energy (ś <hi rend="italic">αkti)</hi> of some god, especially the wife of Siva, in one of her many forms (Pārvatī, Devī, Kālī, Bhavānī, Durgā, &amp;amp;c.). This worship of a female representation of the divine power appears already in some of the Purāṇas; but in the Tantras it assumes quite a peculiar character, being largely intermixed with magic performances and mystic rites, partly, indeed, of a grossly immoral nature (see Hinduism). Of this class of writings no specimen would appear to have as yet been in existence at the time of Amarasimha (6th century), though they are mentioned in some of the Purāṇas. They are usually in the form of a dialogue between Siva and his wife. The number of original Tantras is fixed at sixty-four, but they still await a critical examination at the hands of scholars.

The great national epics, composed though they were in a language different from the ordinary vernaculars, had at least been drawn from the living stream of popular tradition, and were doubtless readily understood and enjoyed by at least the educated classes of the people. The later productions, on the other hand, are of a decidedly artificial character, and must necessarily have been beyond the reach of any but the highly cultivated. They are, on the whole, singularly deficient in incident and invention, their subject matter being almost entirely derived from the old epics. Nevertheless, these works are by no means devoid of merit and interest; and a number of them display considerable descriptive power and a wealth of genuine poetic sentiment, though unfortunately often clothed in language that deprives it of half its value. The simple heroic couplet has mostly been discarded for various more or less elaborate metres; and in accordance with this change of form the diction becomes gradually more complicated—a growing taste for unwieldy compounds, a jingling kind of alliteration, or rather agnomination, and an abuse of similes marking the increasing artificiality of these productions.</p><p>The generic appellation of such works is <hi rend="italic">kāvya,</hi> which, meaning “poem, or the work of an individual poet (<hi rend="italic">kαvi</hi>), is, as we have seen, already applied to the <hi rend="italic">Rāmāyana.</hi> Six poems of this kind are singled out by native rhetoricians as standard works, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Mahãkävya,</hi> or great poems. Two of these are ascribed to the famous dramatist Kâlidãsa, the most prominent figure of this period of Indian literature and truly a master of the poetic art. In a comparatively modern couplet he is represented as having been one of nine literary “ gems ” at the court of a king Vikramäditya, who was supposed to have originated the so-called Vikrama era, dating from 56-57 B.C. Recent research has, however, shown that this name was only applied to the era from about A.D. 800, and that the latter was already used in inscriptions of the 5th century under the name of the Mälava era. Hence also Fergusson's theory that it was founded by King Vikramäditya Harsha of Ujjayinī (Ujjain or</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0171" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0188.jp2"/><p>Oujein) in A.D. 544 and ante-dated by 600 years, falls to the ground; and with it Max Müller’s theory<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="82"> Propounded in Note G of his <hi rend="italic">India, What can it Teach Us ?</hi> </note> of an Indian Renaissance in-augurated during the reign of that king. Though Kãlidãsa’s date thus remains still uncertain, the probability is that he flourished at Ujjayini about 440-448A.D. Of the principal poets of this class, whose works have come down to us, he appears to be one of the earliest; but there can be little doubt that he was preceded in this as in other departments of poetic composition by many lesser lights, eclipsed by the sun of his fame, and forgotten. Thus the recently discovered <hi rend="italic">Buddhacharita,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="83"> Ed. by E. B.

(4) The</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sisupala-badha,</hi> or slaying of Sisupãla, who, being a prince of Chedi, reviled Krishna, who had carried off his intended wife, and was killed by him at the inauguration sacrifice of Yudhishthira, is a poem consisting of twenty cantos, attributed to Mägha,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="90"> Mägha probably livedin the 9th century, though Bháo Dáji, in his paper on Kãlidãsa, would make him “a contemporary of the Bhoja of the 11th century.” </note> whence it is also called <hi rend="italic">Mαghαkαvyα.</hi> (5) The <hi rend="italic">Rαvαnαbαdhα,</hi> or “slaying of Rãvana,” more commonly called <hi rend="italic">Βhαttikαυyα,</hi> to distinguish it from other poems (especially one by Pravarasena), likewise bearing the former title, was composed for the practical purpose oí illustrating the less common grammatical forms and the figures of rhetoric and poetry. In its closing couplet it professes to have been written at Vallabhï, under Sridharasena, but, several princes of that name being mentioned in inscriptions as having ruled there in the 6th and 7th centuries, its exact date is still uncertain. Bhatti, apparently the author’s name, is usually identified with the well-known grammarian Bhartrihari, whose death Professor M. Müller, from a Chinese statement, fixes at a.d. 650, while others make him Bhartrihari’s son. (6) The <hi rend="italic">Naishadhïya,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Nαishαdhα-chαritα,</hi> the life of Nala, king of Nishadha, is ascribed to Srï-Harsha (son oí Hira), who is supposed to have lived in the latter part of the 12th century. A small portion of the simple and noble episode of the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> is here retold in highly elaborate and polished stanzas, and with a degree of lasciviousness which (unless it be chiefly due to the poet’s exuberance of fancy) gives a truly appalling picture oí social corruption. Another highly esteemed poem, the <hi rend="italic">Räghava-päwIawya,</hi> composed by Kaviräja ("king of poets ”)—whose date is uncertain,</p><p>some scholars placing him about A.D. 800, others later than the 10th century—is characteristic of the trifling uses to which the poet’s art was put.

Wilson, <hi rend="italic">Select Specimens of the Theatre of the Hindus</hi> (3rd ed., 2 vols., 1871) ; Sylvain Lévi, <hi rend="italic">Le Théâtre indien</hi> (Paris, 1890). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>—The early history of the Indian drama is enveloped in obscurity. The Hindus themselves ascribe the origin of dramatic representation to the sage Bharata, who is fabled to have lived in remote antiquity, and to have received this science directly from the god Brahman, by whom it was extracted from the Veda. The term <hi rend="italic">bharata—(?) i.e.</hi> one who is kept, or one who sustains( a part)—also signifies “ an actor ”; but it is doubtful which of the two is the earlier—</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0172" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0189.jp2"/><p>the appellative use of the word, or the notion of an old teacher of the dramatic art bearing that name. There still exists an extensive work, in epic verse, on rhetoric and dramaturgy, entitled <hi rend="italic">Nä ya-éästra,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="100"> Ed., in <hi rend="italic">Kãvyamãlâ</hi> (Bombay, 1894); by Grosset (Lyons, 1897). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>and ascribed to Bharata. Though this is probably the oldest theoretic work on the subject that has come down to us, it can hardly be referred to an earlier period than several centuries after the Christian era. Not improbably, however, this work, which presupposes a fully developed scenic art, had an origin similar to that of some of the metrical law-books, which are generally supposed to be popular and improved editions of older sütra-works. We know that such treatises existed at the time of Panini, as he mentions two authors of <hi rend="italic">Nata-sütras,</hi> or “ rules for actors, ” viz. Silãlin and Krisasva. Now, the words <hi rend="italic">nata</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nälya</hi> —as well as n <hi rend="italic">ataka,</hi> the common term for “ drama ” —being derived (like the modern vernacular “ Nautch"= <hi rend="italic">nritya</hi>) from the root <hi rend="italic">nat</hi> (<hi rend="italic">nrt</hi>) “ to dance, ” seem to point to a pantomimic or choral origin of the dramatic art. It might appear doubtful, therefore, in the absence of any clearer definition in Päpini’s grammar, whether the “ actors’ rules ” he mentions did not refer to mere pantomimic performances. Fortunately, however, Patanjali,. in his “ great commentary,” speaks of the actor as singing, and of people going “ to hear the actor.” Nay, he even mentions two subjects, taken from the cycle of Vishnu legends—viz. the slaying of Kamsa (by Krishna) and the binding of Bali (by Vishnu)—which were represented on the stage both by mimic action and declamation. Judging from these allusions, theatrical entertainments in those days seem to have been very much on a level with the old religious spectacles or mysteries of Europe, though there may already have been some simple kinds of secular plays which Patanjali had no occasion to mention. It is not, however, till some five or six centuries later that we meet with the first real dramas, which mark at the same time the very culminating point of Indian dramatic composition. In this, as in other departments of literature, the earlier works have had to make way for later and more perfect productions; and no trace now remains of the intermediate phases of development. Thus we know of at least five predecessors of Kãlidãsa from whom nothing but a few quotations have been preserved.</p><p>Here, however, the problem presents itself as to whether the existing dramatic literature has naturally grown out of such popular religious performances as are alluded to by Patanjali, or whether some foreign influence has intervened at some time or other and given a different direction to dramatic composition. The question has been argued both for and against the probability of Greek influence; but it must still be considered as <hi rend="italic">subjudice;</hi> the latest investigator, M. Sylvain Lévi, having given a decided opinion against outside influence. There are doubtless some curious points of resemblance between the Indian drama and the Modern Attic (and Roman) comedy, viz. the prologue, the occasional occurrence of a token of recognition, and a certain correspondence of characteristic stage figures—especially the Vidüshaka, or jocose companion of the hero, presenting a certain analogy to the servus of the Roman stage, as does the Vita, the hero’s dissolute, though accomplished, boon-companion, of some plays, to the Roman parasite—for which the assumption of some acquaintance with the Greek comedy on the part of the earlier Hindu writers would afford a ready explanation. On the other hand, the differences between the Indian and Greek plays are perhaps even greater than their coincidences, which, moreover, are scarcely close enough to warrant our calling in question the originality of the Hindus in this respect. Certain, however, it is that, if the Indian poets were indebted to Greek playwrights for the first impulse in dramatic composition, in the higher sense, they have known admirably how to adapt the Hellenic muse to the national genius, and have produced a dramatic literature worthy to be ranked side by side with both the classical and our own romantic drama. It is to the latter especially that the general character of the Indian play presents a striking resemblance, much more so than to the classical drama. The Hindu dramatist has little regard for the “ unities ” of the</p><p>classical stage, though he is hardly ever guilty of extravagance in his disregard of them. Unlike the Greek dramatic theory, it is an invariable rule of Indian dramaturgy, that every play, however much of the tragic element it may contain, must have a happy ending. The dialogue is invariably carried on in prose, plentifully interspersed with those neatly turned lyrical stanzas in which the Indian poet delights to depict some natural scene, or some temporary physical or mental condition. The most striking feature of the Hindu play, however, is the mixed nature of its language. While the hero and leading male characters speak Sanskrit, women and inferior male characters use various Prakrit dialects. As regards these dialectic varieties, it can hardly be doubted that at the time when they were first employed in this way they were local vernacular dialects; but in the course of the development of the scenic art they became permanently fixed for special dramatic purposes, just as the Sanskrit had, long before that time, become fixed for general literary purposes. Thus it would happen that these Prakrit dialects, having once become stationary, soon diverged from the spoken vernaculars, until the difference between them was as great as between the Sanskrit and the Prakrits. As regards the general character of the dramatic Prakrits, they are somewhat more removed from the Sanskrit type than the Päli, the language of the Buddhist canon, which again is in a rather more advanced state than the language of the Asoka inscriptions (c. 250 b.c.). And, as the Buddhist sacred books were committed to writing about 80 b.c., the state of their language is attested for that period at latest; while the grammatical fixation of the scenic Präkrits has probably to be referred to the early centuries of the Christian era.</p><p>The existing dramatic literature is not very extensive. The number of plays of all kinds of any literary value will scarcely amount to fifty. The reason for this paucity of dramatic productions doubtless is that they appealed to the tastes of only a limited class of highly cultivated persons, and were in consequence but seldom acted. As regards the theatrical entertainments of the common people, their standard seems never to have risen much above the level of the religious spectacles mentioned by Patanjali. Such at least is evidently the case as regards the modern Bengali <hi rend="italic">jãträs</hi> (Skt. yãtrãs)—described by Wilson as exhibitions of some incidents in the youthful life of Krishna, maintained in extempore dialogue, interspersed with popular songs—as well as the similar <hi rend="italic">rasas</hi> of the western provinces, and the rough and ready performances of the <hi rend="italic">bhanrs,</hi> or professional buffoons. Of the religious drama Sanskrit literature offers but one example, viz. the famous <hi rend="italic">Gita-goυindai</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="101"> <hi rend="sub">i</hi> @@@Edited, with a Latin translation, by C. Lassen ; English translation by E. Arnold. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>composed by Jayadeva in the 12th century. It is rather a mytho-lyrical poem, which, however, in the opinion of Lassen, may be considered as a modern and refined specimen of the early form of dramatic composition. The subject of the poem is as follows: Krishna, while leading a cowherd’s life in Vrindavana, is in love with Rãdhfi, the milkmaid, but has been faithless to her for a while. Presently, however, he returns to her “ whose image has all the while lingered in his breast,” and after much earnest entreaty obtains her forgiveness. The emotions appropriate to these situations are expressed by the two lovers and a friend of Rãdhã in melodious and passionate, if voluptuous, stanzas of great poetic beauty. Like the Song of Solomon, the Gïtagovinda, more-over, is supposed by the Hindu commentators to admit of a mystic interpretation; for, “ as Krishna, faithless for a time, discovers the vanity of all other loves, and returns with sorrow and longing to his own darling Rãdhä, so the human soul, after a brief and frantic attachment to objects of sense, burns to return to the God from whence it came ” (Griffith).</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Mrichchhakatikä,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="102"> Edited by F.

Indeed, the fact that neither Kãlidãsa, who mentions three predecessors of his, or Bãna, in reviewing his literary precursors, makes any allusion to the author of this play, as well as other points, seem rather to tell against the latter’s priority. But seeing that Vãmana quotes from the Mrichchhakatikã, this play must at any rate have been in existence in the latter part of the 8th century. According to several stanzas in the prologue, the play was com posed by a king Südraka, who is there stated to have, through Siva’s</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0173" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0190.jp2"/><p>favour, recovered his eyesight, and, after seeing his son as king, to have died at the ripe age of a hundred years and ten days. Accord-ing to the same stanzas, the piece was enacted after the king’s death ; but it is probable that they were added for a subsequent performance. In Bana’s novel <hi rend="italic">Kãdamban</hi> (c. A.D. 630), a king Südraka is represented as having resided at Bidisã (Bhilsa)— some 130 m. east of Ujjayinï (Ujjain), where the scene of the play is laid. Chãrudatta, a Brahman merchant, reduced to poverty, and</p><p>Vasantasenã, an accomplished courtezan, meet and fall in love with each other. This forms the main plot, which is interwoven with a political underplot, resulting in a change of dynasty. The connexion between the two plots is effected by means of the king’s rascally brother-in-law, who pursues Vasantasenã with his addresses, as well as by the part of the rebellious cowherd Aryaka, who, having escaped from prison, finds shelter in the hero’s house. The wicked prince, on being rejected, strangles Vasantasenã, and accuses Chãrudatta of having murdered her; but, just as the latter is about to be executed, his lady love appears again on the scene. Meanwhile Äryaka has succeeded in deposing the king, and, having himself mounted the throne of Ujjain, he raises Vasantasena to the position of an honest woman, to enable her to become the wife of Chãrudatta. The play is one of the longest, consisting of not less than ten acts, some of which, however, are very short. The interest of the action is, on the whole, well sustained; and, altogether, the piece presents a vivid picture of the social manners of the time, whilst the author shows himself imbued with a keen sense of humour, and a master in the delineation of character.</p><p>In Kãlidãsa the dramatic art attained its highest point of perfection. From this accomplished poet we have three well-constructed plays, abounding in stanzas of exquisite tenderness and fine descriptive passages, viz. the two well-known mytho-pastoral dramas, <hi rend="italic">Sakuntalä</hi> in seven and <hi rend="italic">Vikramorvasï</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="103"> Both these plays are known in different recensions in different </note> <hi rend="italic"/>in five acts, and a piece of court intrigue, distinctly inferior to the other two, entitled <hi rend="italic">Malaυikagnimitra</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="104"> Edited critically by S.

King Agnimitra, who has two wives, falls in love with Mãlavikã, maid to the first queen. His wives endeavour to frustrate their affection for each other, but in the end Mãlavikã turns out to be a princess by birth, and is</p><p>accepted by the queens as their sister.</p><p>êrï-Harshadeva—identical with the king (Sflãditya) Harshaνar-</p><p>dhana of Kãnyakubja (Kanauj) mentioned above, who ruled in the first half of the 7th century—has three plays attributed to him ; though possibly only dedicated to him by poets patronized by him. This at least commentators state to have been the case as regards the <hi rend="italic">Ratnävali,</hi> the authorship of which they assign to</p><p>Bãna. lndeed, had they been the king’s own productions, one might have expected the Chinese pilgrims (especially I-tsing, who saw one of the plays performed) to mention the fact.

Wilson. </note> <hi rend="italic"/><hi rend="italic">“</hi> the pearl necklace,” is a graceful comedy of genteel domestic manners, in four acts, of no great originality of invention ; the author having been largely indebted to Kälidãsa’s plays. A decided merit of the poet’s art is the simplicity and clearness of his style. Ratnãvalï, a Ceylon princess, is sent by her father to the court of King Udayana of Vatsa to become his second wife. She suffers shipwreck, but is rescued and received into Udayana’s palace under the name of Sãgarikã, as one of Queen Vãsavadattã’s attendants. The king falls in love with her, and the queen tries to keep them apart from each other: but, on learning the maiden’s origin, she becomes reconciled, and recognizes her as a “ sister.” According to H. H. Wilson, “ the manners depictured are not influenced by lofty principle or profound reflection, but they are mild, affectionate and elegant. It may be doubted whether the harems of other eastern nations, either in ancient or modern times, would afford materials for as favourable a delineation.” Very similar in construction, but distinctly inferior, is the <hi rend="italic">Priyadarsikä,</hi> in four acts, having for its plot another amour of the same king. The scene of the third play, the <hi rend="italic">Naganandaf</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="106"> Edited by Mãdhava Chandra Ghosha and translated by P. Boyd, with a preface by E. B. Cowell. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>or “ joy of the serpents ” (in five acts), on the other hand, is laid in semi-divine regions. Jîmütavähana, a prince of the Vidyãdharas, imbued with Buddhist principles, weds Malayavatï, daughter of the king of the Siddhas, a votary of Gaurî (Siva’s wife). But, learning that Garuda the mythic bird, is in the habit of consuming one snake daily, he resolves to offer himself to the bird as a victim, and finally succeeds in converting Garuda to the principle of ahiípsã, or abstention from doing injury to living beings; but he himself is about</p><p>to succumb from the wounds he has received, when, through the timely intervention of the goddess Gauri, he is restored to his former condition. The piece seems to have been intended as a compromise between Brãhmanical (Saiva) and Buddhist doctrines, being thus in keeping with the religious views of king Harsha, who, as we know from Hiuen Thsang, favoured Buddhism, but was very tolerant to Brãhmans. It begins with a benedictory stanza to Buddha, and concludes with one to Gaurî. The author is generally believed to have been a Buddhist, but it is more likely that he was a Saiva Brahman, possibly Bana himself. Nay, one might almost feel inclined to take the hero’s self-sacrifice in favour of a Nãga as a travesty of Buddhist principles. In spite of its shortcomings of construction the Nãgãnanda is a play of considerable merit, the characters being drawn with a sure hand, and the humorous element introduced into it of a very respectable order.</p><p>Bhavabhuti, surnamed Sri-kaçtha, “he in whose throat there is beauty (eloquence),”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="107"> This is the commentator’s explanation of the name, whilst M. Lévi would render it by “ the divine throat.” </note> was a native of Padmapura in the Vidarbha country (the Berars), being the son of the Brãhman Nïlakantha and his wife Jãtukarni. He passed his literary life chiefly at the court of Yasovarman of Kanauj, who must have reigned in the latter part of the 7th century, seeing that, after a successful reign, he suffered defeat at the hands of Lalãditya of Kashmir, who had mounted his throne inA.D. 695.

The action of the play is full of life, and abounds in stirring, though sometimes improbable, incidents. The poet is considered by native critics to be not only not inferior to Kãlidãsa, but even to have surpassed him in his <hi rend="italic">Uttararämacharita,</hi> which certainly contains many fine poetic passages instinct with pathos and genuine feeling. But, though he ranks deservedly high as a lyric poet, he is far inferior to Kãlidãsa as a dramatic artist. Whilst the latter delights in depicting the gentler feelings and tender emotions of the human heart and the peaceful scenes of rural life, the younger poet finds a peculiar attraction in the sterner and more imposing aspects of nature and the human character. Bhavabhñti’s language, though polished and felicitous, is elaborate and artificial compared with that of Kãlidãsa, and his genius is sorely shackled by a slavish adherence to the arbitrary rules of dramatic theorists.</p><p>Bhatta Nãrãyana, surnamed Mpgarãja or Simha, “ the lion,” the author of the <hi rend="italic">Venisamhαrα</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="111"> Edited by J.

Tradition makes him one of the five Kanauj Brãhmans whom king Ädisura of Bengal, desirous of establishing the pure Vaishnava doctrine, invited to his court, and from whom the modern Bengali Brãhmans are supposed to be descended. But be this as it may, a copperplate grant was issued to our poet in a.d. 840; and, besides, he is quoted in Anandavardhana’s <hi rend="italic">Dhυanyaloka,</hi> written in the latter part of the 9th century. The play, consisting of six acts, takes its title from an incident in the story of the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata</hi> when.Draupadï, having been lost at dice by Yudhishthira, has her braid of hair unloosened, and is dragged by the hair before the assembly by one of the Kauravas; this insult being subsequently avenged by Bhïma. slaying the offender, whereupon Draupadï’s braid is tied up again, as beseems a married woman. The piece is composed in a style similar to that of Bhavabhûti’s plays, but is inferior to them in dramatic construction and poetic merit, though valued by critics for its strict adherence to the rules of the dramatic theory.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Hαnuman-nataka</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="112"> Printed with Mohanadãsa’s commentary (Bombay, 1861). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>is a dramatized version of the storyof Rãma, interspersed with numerous purely descriptive poetic passages. It consists of fourteen acts, and on account of its length is also called the <hi rend="italic">Mahä-nätaka,</hi> or great drama. Contrary to the general practice, it has no prologue, and Sanskrit alone is employed in it. Tradition relates that it was composed by Hanumãn, the monkey general, and inscribed on rocks; but, Vãlmïki, the author of the <hi rend="italic">Rämäyana,</hi></p><p>parts of India. The Bengali recension of the <hi rend="italic">Sakuntalä</hi> was trans-ated by Sir W. Jones, and into French, with the text, by Chézy, and again edited by R.

Thence fragments were ultimately picked up by a merchant, and brought to King Bhoja, who directed the poet Dâmodara Misra to put them together and fill up the lacunae; whence the present composition originated. Whatever particle of truth there may be in this story, the “ great drama ” seems certainly to be the production of different hands. “ The language,” as Wilson remarks, “ is in general very harmonious, but the work is after all a most disjointed and non-descript composition, and the patchwork is very glaringly and clumsily put together.” It is nevertheless a work of some interest, as compositions of mixed dramatic and declamatory passages of this kind may have been common in the early stages of the dramatic art. The connexion of the poet with King Bhoja, also confirmed by the <hi rend="italic">Bhoja-prabandha,</hi> would bring the composition, or final redaction, down to about the 10th or 11th century. A <hi rend="italic">Mahãnãtaka</hi> is, however, already referred to by Änandavardhana (9th century) ; and, besides, there are two different recensions of the work, a shorter one commented upon by Mohanadãsa, and a longer one arranged by Madhusudana.

The profane lyrical poetry consists chiefly of such little poetic pictures, which form a prominent feature of dramatic compositions. Numerous poets and poetesses are only known to us through such detached stanzas, preserved in native anthologies or manuals of rhetoric, and enshrining a vast amount of descriptive and contemplative poetry.

These verses are either of a purely descriptive or of an erotic character; or they have a didactic tendency, being intended to convey, in an attractive and easily remembered form, some moral truth or useful counsel.

Of independent productions of this kind only a few of the more important can be mentioned here. Sankara Âchãrya, the great Vedãntist, who seems to have flourished about A. D. 800, is credited with several devotional poems, especially the <hi rend="italic">Ananda-laharï,</hi> or “ wave of joy,” a hymn of 103 stanzas, in praise of the goddess Pãrvatï. The <hi rend="italic">Sürya-sataka,</hi> or century of stanzas in praise of Sürya, the sun, is ascribed to Mayüra, the contemporary (and, according to a tradition, the father-in-law) of Bãna (in the early part of the 7th century).

The <hi rend="italic">Khandaprasasti,</hi> a poem celebrating the ten avatäras of Vishnu, is ascribed to no other than Hanumãn, the monkey general, himself. Jayadeva’s beautiful poem <hi rend="italic">Gitago-vinda,</hi> which, like most productions concerning Kχishζta, is of a very sensuous character, has already been referred to.</p><p>The particular branch of didactic poetry in which India is especially rich is that of moral maxims, expressed in single stanzas or couplets, and forming the chief vehicle of the <hi rend="italic">Nïti-éastra</hi> or ethic science. Excellent collections of such aphorisms have been published—in Sanskrit and German by O. v. Böhtlingk, and in English by John Muir.

That the number of those actually extant is comparatively small is, however, chiefly due to the fact that this class of works was supplanted by another of a more popular kind, which covered the same ground. The Dharmasötras consist chiefly of strings of terse rules, containing the essentials of the science, and intended to be committed to memory, and to be expounded orally by the teacher—thus forming, as it were, epitomes of class lectures. These rules are interspersed</p><p>with stanzas or “ gãthas,” in various metres, cither composed by the author himself or quoted from elsewhere, which generally give the substance of the preceding rules. One can well understand why such couplets should gradually have become more popular, and should ultimately have led to the appearance of works entirely composed in verse. Such metrical law-books did spring up in large numbers, not all at once, but over a long period of time, extending probably from about the beginning of our era, or even earlier, down to well-nigh the Mahommedan conquest; and, as at the time of their first appearance the epic impulse was particularly strong, other metres were entirely discarded for the epic sloka. These works are the metrical <hi rend="italic">Dharma-éãstras,</hi> or, as they are usually called, the <hi rend="italic">Smriti,</hi> “ recollection, tradition,”—a term which, as we have seen, belonged to the whole body of Sutras (as opposed to the <hi rend="italic">Sruti,</hi> or revelation), but which has become the almost exclusive title of the versified institutes of law (and the few Dharmasötras still extant). Of metrical Smritis about forty are hitherto known to exist, but their total number probably amounted to at least double that figure, though some of these, it is true, are but short and insignificant tracts, while others are only different recensions of one and the same work.</p><p>With the exception of a few of these works—such as the <hi rend="italic">Agni·, Yama-</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vishnu-Smrftis—</hi> which are ascribed to the respective gods, the authorship of the Smritis is attributed to old rishis, such as Atri, Kanva, Vyãsa, Sandilya, Bharadvãja. It is, however, extremely doubtful whether in most cases this attribution is not altogether fanciful, or whether, as a rule, there really existed a traditional connexion between these works and their alleged authors or schools named after them. The idea, which early suggested itself to Sanskrit scholars, that Smritis which passed by the names of old Vedic teachers and their schools might simply be metrical recasts of the Dharma- (or Gphya-) sutras of these schools, was a very natural one, and, indeed, is still a very probable one, though the loss of the original Sutras, and the modifications and additions which the Smritis doubtless underwent in course of time, make it very difficult to prove this point. One could, how-evcr, scarcely account for the disappearance of the Dharmasötras of some of the most important schools except on the ground that they were given up in favour of other works; and it is not very likely that this should have been done, unless there was some guarantee that the new works, upon the whole, embodied the doctrines of the old authorities of the respective schools. Thus, as regards the most important of the Smritis, the <hi rend="italic">Mänava-Dharmasästra,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="136"> The standard edition is by G. C. Haughton, with Sir W. Jones’s translation (1825); the latest translations by A. Burnell and G. Bühler. There is also a critical essay on the work by F. Johantgen On the relation between the Dharmasûtras and Smritis see especially West and Bühler, <hi rend="italic">Digest of Hindu Law</hi> (3rd ed.), 1. p. 37 seq. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>there exist both a Srauta- and a Grihya-sutra of the Mãnava school of the Black Yajus, but no such Dharmasûtra has hitherto been discovered, though the former existence of such a work has been made all but certain by Professor Buhler's discovery of quotations from a Mãnavam, consisting partly of prose rules, and partly of couplets, some of which occur literally in the Manusmriti, whilst others have been slightly altered there to suit later doctrines, or have been changed from the original trishtubh into the epic metre. The idea of an old law-giver Manu Svãyambhuva—“ sprung from the self-existent (svayam-bhü) ” god Brahman (m.).—reaches far back into Vedic antiquity : he is mentioned as such in early texts; and in Yaska’s <hi rend="italic">Nirukta</hi> a sloka occurs giving his opinion on a point of inheritance. But whether or not the Mãnava-Dnarmasütra embodied what were supposed to be the authoritative precepts of this sage on questions of sacred law we do not know; nor can it as yet be shown that the Manusmriti, which seems itself to have undergone considerable modifications, is the lineal descendant of that Dharmasûtra. It is, however, worthy of note that a very close connexion exists between the Manusmriti and the Vishijusastra; and, as the latter is most likely a modern, only partially remodelled, edition of the Sutras of the Black Yajus school of the Kathas, the dose relation between the two works would be easily understood, if it could be shown that the Manusmriti is a modern development of the Sutras of another school of the Charaka division of the Black Yajurveda.</p><p>The Mãnava Dharmasãstra consists of twelve books, the first and last of which, treating of creation, transmigration and final beatitude, are, however, generally regarded as later additions. In them the legendary sage Bhrigu, here called a Mãnava, is introduced as Manu’s disciple, through whom the great teacher has his work promulgated. Why this intermediate agent should have been con-sidered necessary is by no means clear. Except in these two books the work shows no special relation to Manu, for, though he is occasionally referred to in it, the same is done in other Smritis. The question as to the probable date of the final redaction of the work cannot as yet be answered. Dr Burnell has tried to show that it was probably composed under the Chãlukya king Pulakesi, about A.D. 500, but his argumentation is anything but convincing. From several slokas quoted from Manu by Varãhamihira, in the 6th cen-tury, it would appear that the text which the great astronomer had before him differed very considerably from our Manusmriti. It is, however, possible that he referred either to the <hi rend="italic">Brfihat-Manu</hi> (Great</p><p>1892); chapters 1-8 edited and translated by Sylvain Lévi, <hi rend="italic">Journ.</hi> (1886); cf. F.

The oldest existing commentary on the <hi rend="italic">Manava-Dharmasastra</hi> is by Medhãtlthi, who is first quoted in 1200, and is usually supposed to have lived in the 9th or 10th century. He had, however, several predecessors to whom he refers as <hi rend="italic">pürve,</hi> “ the former ones.” The most esteemed of the commentaries is that of Kulluka Bhatta, composed at Benares in the 15th century.</p><p>Next in importance among Smritis ranks the <hi rend="italic">Yõfnavalkya Dharma-sastra.</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="137"> Edited, with a German translation, by F. Stenzler. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>Its origin and date are not less uncertain—except that, in the opinion of Professor Stenzler, which has never been questioned, it is based on the Manusmriti, and represents a more advanced stage of legal theory and definition than that work. Yãjñavalkya, as we have seen, is looked upon as the founder of the Vãjasaneyins or White Yajus, and the author of the Satapatha-brahmana. In the latter work he is represented as having passed some time at the court of King Janaka of Videha (Tirhut) ; and in accordance therewith he is stated, in the introductory couplets of the Dharmasãstra, to have propounded his legal doctrines to the sages, while staying at Mithilã (the capital of Videha). Hence, if the connexion between the metrical Smritis and the old Vedic schools be a real one and not one of name merely, we should expect to find in the Yãjñavalkya-smriti special coincidences of doctrine with the Kãtïya-sûtra, the principal Sutra of the Vãjasaneyins. Now, some sufficiently striking coincidences between this Smriti and Pãraskara's <hi rend="italic">Katïya-Grihyasütra</hi> have indeed been pointed out; and if there ever existed a Dharmasutra belonging to the same school, of which no trace has hitherto been found, the points of agreement between this and the Dharmaéãstra might be expected to be even more numerous. A connexion between this Smriti and the Mãnava-gphyasütra seems, however, likewise evident. As in the case of Manu, slokas are quoted in various works from a <hi rend="italic">Brihat-</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">Vriddha-Yãfñavalkya.</hi> The Yãjñavalkya-smriti consists of three books, corresponding to the three great divisions of the Indian theory of law: <hi rend="italic">achära,</hi> rule of conduct (social and caste duties); <hi rend="italic">vyavahãra,</hi> civil and criminal law; and <hi rend="italic">prayaéchitta,</hi> penance or expiation.

It does not concern itself with religious and moral precepts, but is strictly confined to law. Of this work again there are at least two different recensions.</p><p>Besides the text translated by Dr Jolly, a portion of a larger recension has come to light in India. This version has been commented upon by Asahãya, “the peerless ”—a very esteemed writer on law who is supposed to have lived before Meahãtithi (? 9th century)—and it may therefore be considered as the older recension of the two. But, as it has been found to contain the word <hi rend="italic">dïnara,</hi> an adaptation of the Roman <hi rend="italic">denarius,</hi> it cannot, at any rate, be older than the 2nd century; indeed, its date is probably several centuries later.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">Paräsara-smziti</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="140"> Edited in Bombay Sansk.

The deficiency was, however, supplied by the famous exegete Mâdhava (in the latter half of the 14th century), who made use of Parâáara’s text for the compilation of a large digest of religious law, usually called <hi rend="italic">Paräsara-mädhavïyam,</hi> to which he added a third chapter on vyavahãra, or law proper. Besides the ordinary text of the Parasara-smriti, consisting of rather less than 600 couplets, there is also extant a <hi rend="italic">Brihat-Paräéarasmzüi,</hi> probably an amplification of the former, containing not less than 2980 (accord</p><p>ing to others even 3300) álokas.</p><p>Whether any of the Dharmaáâstras were ever used in India as actual “ codes of law ” for the practical administration of justice is very doubtful; indeed, so far as the most prominent works of this class are concerned, it is highly improbable<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="141"> See West and Bühler, <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi> i. p. 55.

Hence, the moment the actual work of codification begins in the 11th century, we find the jurists engaged in practically showing how the Smritis confirm and supplement each other, and in reconciling seeming contradictions between them.

Garbe, <hi rend="italic">Philosophy of Ancient India</hi> (Chicago, 1897). </note>-The contemplative Indian mind shows at all times a strong disposition for metaphysical speculation. In the old religious lyrics this may be detected from the very first. Not to speak of the abstract nature of some even of the oldest Vedic deities, this propensity betrays itself in a certain mystic symbolism, tending to refine and spiritualize the original purely physical character and activity of some of the more prominent gods, and to impart a deep and subtle import to the rites of the sacrifice. The primitive worship of more or less isolated elemental forces and phenomena had evidently ceased to satisfy the religious wants of the more thoughtful minds. Various syncretist tendencies show the drift of religious thought towards some kind of unity of the divine powers, be it in the direction of the pantheistic idea, or in that of au organized polytheism, or even towards monotheism. In the latter age of the hymns the pantheistic idea is rapidly gaining ground, and finds vent in various cosmogonic speculations; and in the Brãhmana period we see it fully developed. The fundamental conception of this doctrine finds its expression in the two synonymous terms <hi rend="italic">brahman</hi> (neutr.), probably originally “ mystic effusion, devotional utterance,”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="145"> The etymological connexion of <hi rend="italic">brahman</hi> (from root <hi rend="italic">varh, vardh)</hi> with Latin <hi rend="italic">verbum,</hi> English <hi rend="italic">word</hi> (corresponding to a Sanskrit <hi rend="italic">vardha),</hi> assumed by some scholars, though doubtful, is not impossible. The development of its meaning would be somewhat like that of λ0γos. </note> then “ holy impulse,” and a <hi rend="italic">tman</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="146"> The derivation of <hi rend="italic">atman</hi> (Ger. <hi rend="italic">Atem)</hi> from root <hi rend="italic">an</hi>, to breathe (or perhaps <hi rend="italic">av,</hi> to blow) seems still the most likely. A recent attempt to connect it with <hi rend="italic">αIπfa</hi> can scarcely commend itself. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>(masc.), “ breath, self, soul.”</p><p>The recognition of the essential sameness of the individual souls, emanating all alike (whether really or imaginarily) from the ultimate spiritual essence <hi rend="italic">(parama-brahman)</hi> "as sparks issue from the fire,” and destined to return thither, involved some important problems. Considering the infinite diversity of individual souls of the animal and vegetable world, exhibiting various degrees of perfection, is it conceivable that each of them is the immediate efflux of the Supreme Being, the All-perfect, and that each, from the lowest to the highest, could re-unite therewith directly at the close of its mundane existence? The difficulty implied in the latter question was at first met by the assumption of an intermediate state of expiation and</p><p>purification, a kind of purgatory; but the whole problem found at ast a more comprehensive solution in the doctrine of transmigration <hi rend="italic">(samsara).</hi> Some scholars have suggested<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="147"> See, <hi rend="italic">e,g, A.</hi> E. Gough, <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of the Upanishads,</hi> p. 24; A. A. Macdonell, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of Sanskrit Lit.</hi> p. 387. </note> that metempsychosis may have been the prevalent belief among the aboriginal tribes of India, and may have been taken over from them by the Indo-Aryaps. This, no doubt, is possible; but in the absence of any positive proof it would be idle to speculate on its probability; the more so as the pantheistic notion of a universal spiritual essence would probably of itself sufficiently account for the spontaneous growth of such a belief. In any case, however, we can only assume that speculative minds seized upon it as offering the most satisfactory (if not the only possible) explanation of the great problem of phenomenal existence with its unequal distribution of weal and woe. It is certainly a significant fact that, once established in Indian thought, the doctrine of metempsychosis is never again called in question— that, like the fundamental idea on which it rests, viz. the essential sameness of the immaterial element of all sentient beings, the notion of <hi rend="italic">samsara</hi> has become an axiom, a universally conceded principle of Indian philosophy. Thus the latter has never quite risen to the heights of pure thought ; its object is indeed <hi rend="italic">jijñäsä,</hi> the search for knowledge; but it is an inquiry <hi rend="italic">(mïmämsä)</hi> into the nature of things undertaken not solely for the attainment of the truth, but with a view to a specific object—the discontinuance of samsãra, the cessation of mundane existence after the present life. Every sentient being, through ignorance, being liable to sin, and destined after each existence to be born again in some new form, dependent on the actions committed during the immediately preceding life, all mundane existence thus is the source of ever-renewed suffering; and the task of the philosopher is to discover the means of attaining <hi rend="italic">moksha,</hi> “ release ” from the bondage of material existence, and union with the Supreme Self—in fact, salvation. It is with a view to this,</p><p>The chapter on inheritance (dãya-vibhãga) translated by A. C. Burnell (1868).</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0177" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0194.jp2"/><p>and to this only, that the Indian metaphysician takes up the great problems of life—the origin of man and the universe, and the relation between mind and matter.</p><p>It is not likely that these speculations were viewed with much favour by the great body of Brãhmans engaged in ritualistic practices. Not that the metaphysicians actually discountenanced the ceremonial worship of the old mythological gods as vain and nugatory. On the contrary, they expressly admitted the propriety of sacrifices, and commended them as the most meritorious of human acts, by which man could raise himself to the highest degrees of mundane existence, to the worlds of the Fathers and Devas. But, on the other hand, metaphysical speculation itself had gradually succeeded in profoundly modifying the original character of the sacrificial ritual : an allegorical meaning had come to be attached to every item of the ceremonial, in accordance with the strange monotheistic-pantheistic theory of the Brähmanas which makes the performance of the sacrifice represent the building up of Prajã-pati, the Purusha or “world man," and thus the creation of reproduction of the universe. In the <hi rend="italic">Satap. Br.</hi> (vii. 3, 4, 41) he is said to be the whole Brahman (n.), and (vii. 1, 2, 7; xi. I, 6, 17) he is represented as the breath or vital air (prãrta), and the air being his self (ãtman). It needed but the identification of the Ãtman, or individual self, with the Brahman or Paramätman (supreme self), to show that the final goal lay far beyond the worlds hitherto striven after through sacrifice, a goal unattainable through aught but a perfect knowledge of the soul’s nature and its identity with the Divine Spirit. “ Know ye that one Self,” exhorts one of those old idealists,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="148"> Mundaka-upanishad,∙ii. 2, 5. </note> “ and have done with other words; for that (knowledge) is the bridge to immortality!” Intense self-contemplation being, moreover, the only way of attaining the all-important knowledge, this doctrine left little or no room for those mediatorial offices of the priest, so indispensable in ceremonial worship; and indeed we actually read of Brãhman sages resorting to Kshatriya princes<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="149"> From such allusions, or statements, in the Upanishads, some scholars have actually gone the length of claiming the origin of this cardinal doctrine of Vedãnta philosophy for the Kshatriyas. It seems to us, however, very much more likely that these anecdotes were introduced by the Brahmanical sages of set purpose to win over their worldly patrons from their materialistic tendencies to their own idealistic views. Kapila, the author of the materialistic Sänkhya, is supposed to have been a Kshatriya, and so, we know, was the Sãkya Muni. </note> to hear them expound the true doctrine of salvation. But, in spite of their anti-hierarchical tendency, these speculations continued to gain ground; and in the end the body of treatises propounding the pantheistic doctrine, the Upanishads, were admitted into the sacred canon, as appendages to the ceremonial writings, the Brähmanas. The Upanishads<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="150"> Cf. P. Deussen, <hi rend="italic">The Philosophy of the Upanishads</hi> (Edinburgh, 1906). </note> thus form literally “the end of the Veda,” the <hi rend="italic">Vedanta</hi>; but their adherents claim this title for their doctrines in a metaphorical rather than in a material sense, as “ the ultimate aim and consummation of the Veda.” In later times the radical distinction between these speculative appendages and the bulk of the Vedic writings was strongly accentuated in a new classification of the sacred scriptures. According to this scheme they were supposed to consist of two great divisions—the <hi rend="italic">Karma-kända, i.e.</hi> “ the work-section,” or practical ceremonial (exoteric) part, consisting of the Sarphitãs and Brahmanas (including the ritual portions of the Aranyakas), and the <hi rend="italic">Jnänakanda,</hi> “ the knowledge-section,” or speculative (esoteric) part. These two divisions are also called respectively the <hi rend="italic">Pürva-</hi> (“ former ”) and <hi rend="italic">Uttara-</hi> (“ latter,” or higher<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="151"> Cf. Mundaka-upanishad, i. 4, 5, where these two divisions are called “ the lower <hi rend="italic">(apara)</hi> and the higher <hi rend="italic">(para)</hi> knowledge.” </note>) <hi rend="italic">kända</hi>; and when the speculative tenets of the Upanishads came to be formulated into a regular system it was deemed desirable that there should also be a special system corresponding to the older and larger portion of the Vedic writings. Thus arose the two systems— the <hi rend="italic">Pürva- (or Karma-) mlmämsä,</hi> or “prior (practical) speculation,” and the <hi rend="italic">Uttara-</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Brahma-) mlmämsä,</hi> or higher inquiry (into the nature of the godhead), usually called the Vedanta philosophy.</p><p>It is not yet possible to determine, even approximately, the time when the so-called <hi rend="italic">Daréanas</hi> (literally “ demonstrations ”), or systems of philosophy which subsequently arose, were first formulated. And, though they have certainly developed from the tenets enunciated in the Upanishads, there is some doubt as to the exact order in which these systems succeeded each other. Of all the systems the Vedanta has indeed remained most closely in touch with the speculations of the Upanishads, which it has further developed and systematized. The authoritative <hi rend="italic">exposes</hi> of the systems have, however, apparently passed through several redactions; and, in their present form, these sutra-works<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="152"> These works have all been printed with commentaries in India; and they have been partly translated by J. Ballantyne and by K. M. Banerjea. The best general view of the systems is to be obtained from H. C. Colebrooke’s account, <hi rend="italic">Misc. Essays,</hi> i.

The <hi rend="italic">(Pürva-) Mlmämsä</hi> is not a system of philosophy in the proper sense of the word, but rather a system of dogmatic criticism and scriptural interpretation. It main tains the eternal existence of the Veda, the different parts of which are minutely classified. Its principal object, however, is to ascertain the religious (chiefly ceremonial) duties enjoined in the Veda, and to show how these duties must be performed, and what are the special merits and rewards attaching to them. Hence arises the necessity of determining the principles for rightly inter-preting the Vedic texts as also of what forms its only claim to being classed among speculative systems, viz. a philosophical examination of the means of, and the proper method for, arriving at accurate knowledge. The foundation of this school, as well as the composition of the Sutras or aphorisms, the <hi rend="italic">Mimämsã-daréana,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="154"> Text and Commentary, <hi rend="italic">Bibl.

This distinguished writer, who has already been mentioned several times, was formerly supposed, from frequent statements in MSS., to have been the brother of Säyana, the well-known interpreter of the Vedas. The late Dr Burnell<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="156"> <hi rend="italic">Vamsa-brähmana,</hi> Introd. </note> has, however, made it very probable that these two are one and the same person, Säyana being his Telugu and Mãdhavä-chärya his Brãhmanical name.

The <hi rend="italic">Vedãnta</hi> philosophy, in the comparatively primitive form in which it presents itself in most of the older Upanishads, constitutes the earliest phase of sustained metaphysical speculation. In its essential features it remains to this day the prevalent belief of Indian thinkers, and enters largely into the religious life and convictions of the people. It is an idealistic monism, which derives the universe from an ultimate conscious spiritual principle, the one and only existent from eternity—the <hi rend="italic">Atman,</hi> the Self, or the <hi rend="italic">Purusha,</hi> the Person, the <hi rend="italic">Brahman.</hi> It is this primordial essence or Self that pervades all things, and gives life and light to them, “ without being sullied by the visible outward im-purities or the miseries of the world, being itself apart”—and into which all things will, through knowledge, ultimately resolve them selves. “ The wise who perceive him as being within their oνn Self, to them belongs eternal peace, not to others.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="157"> Katha-upanishad, ii. 5, 12. </note> But, while the commentators never hesitate to interpret the Upanishads as being in perfect agreement with the Vedãntic system, as elaborated in later times, there is often considerable difficulty in accepting their ex-planations. In these treatises only the leading features of the pantheistic theory find utterance, generally in vague and mystic, though often in singularly powerful and poetical language, from which it is not always possible to extract the author’s real idea on fundamental points, such as the relation between the Supreme Spirit and the phenomenal world—whether the latter was actually evolved from the former by a power inherent in him, or whether the process is altogether a fiction, an illusion of the individual self. Thus the Katha-upanishad<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="158"> Katha-up., i. 3, 10; ii. 6, 7. </note> offers the following summary: “ Beyond the senses [there are the objects; beyond the objects] there is the mind (manas) ; beyond the mind there is the intellect (buddhi); beyond the intellect there is the Great Self. Beyond the Great One there is the Highest Undeveloped (avyaktam) ; beyond</p><p>given in Goldstücker’s <hi rend="italic">Literary Remains,</hi> vol. i.

Whatsoever knows him is liberated, and attains immortality.” Here the Vedãntist commentator assures us that the Great Undeveloped, which the Sãnkhyas would claim as their own primary material principle (pradhãna, prakriti). is in reality <hi rend="italic">Mäyä,</hi> illusion (otherwise called Avidyã, ignorance, or Sakti, power), the fictitious energy which in conjunction with the Highest Self (Ãtman, Purusha) produces or constitutes the Isvara, the Lord, or Cosmic Soul, the first emanation of the Atman, and himself the (fictitious) cause of all that seems to exist. It must remain doubtful, however, whether the author of the Upanishad really meant this, or whether he regarded the Great Undeveloped as an actual material principle or substratum evolved from out of the Purusha, though not, as the Sãnkhyas hold, coexisting with him from eternity. Besides passages such as these which seem to indicate realistic or materialistic tendencies of thought, which may well have developed into the dualistic Sãnkhya and kindred systems, there are others which indicate the existence even of nihilist theories, such as the Bauddhas— the <hi rend="italic">sunya-vadins,</hi> or affirmers of a void or primordial nothingness— profess. Thus we read in the Chhãndogya-upanishad:<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="159"> vi. 2. I. </note> “The existent alone, my son, was here in the beginning, one only, without a second.

How could the existent be born from the non-existent? No, my son, only the existent was here in the beginning, one only, without a second.”</p><p>The foundation of the Yedãnta system, as “ the completion of the Veda,” is naturally ascribed to Vyasa, the mythic arranger of the Vedas, who is said to be identical with Bãdarãyana the reputed author of the <hi rend="italic">Brahma-</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">Säñraka-) sütra,</hi> the authoritative, though highly obscure, summary of the system. The most distinguished interpreter of these aphorisms is the famous Malabar theologian Sankara Ãchãrya,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="160"> <hi rend="italic">Die Sutras des Vedanta,</hi> text and commentary translated by P.

His controversial triumphs (doubtless largely mythical) are related in a number of treatises current in South India, the two most important of which are the <hi rend="italic">Sankara-dig-vijaya</hi> (“ Sankara’s world-conquest ”), ascribed to his own disciple Anandagiri, and the <hi rend="italic">Sankαra-vijaya,</hi> by Mãdhavãchãrya.

In accordance with this distinction, a higher <hi rend="italic">(para)</hi> and a lower <hi rend="italic">(aparä)</hi> form of knowledge is recognized; the former being concerned with the Brahman (n.), whilst the latter deals with the personal Brahma, the Isvara, or lord and creator, who, however, is a mere illusory form of the divine spirit, resulting from ignorance of the human soul. To the question why the Supreme Self (or rather hïs fictitious development, the Highest Lord) should have sent forth this phantasmagory this great thinker (with the author of the Sutras<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="162"> <hi rend="italic">Brahmasutra,</hi> iii. I. 32-34. </note>) can return no better answer than that it must have been done for sport(ZïZã), without any special motive—since to ascribe such a motive to the Supreme Lord would be limiting his self-sufficiency—and that the process of creation has been going on from all eternity.

Ind.</hi> </note> <hi rend="italic"/>is the most esteemed. Of numerous other commentaries on the Brahma-sütras, the <hi rend="italic">Srï-bhäshya,</hi> by Rãmãnuja, the founder of the Sri-Vaishnava sect, is the most note-worthy. This religious teacher, who flourished in the first half of the 12th century, caused a schism in the Vedänta school. Instead of adhering to Sankara’s orthodox <hi rend="italic">advaita,</hi> or non-duality, doctrine, he interpreted the obscure Sutras in accordance with his theory of <hi rend="italic">viéishtädvaita, i.e.</hi> non-duality of the (two) distinct (principles), or, as it is more commonly explained, non-duality of that which is qualified (by attributes). According to this theory the Brahman is neither devoid of form and quality, nor is it all things; but it is endowed with all good qualities, and matter is distinct from it; whilst bodies consist of souls <hi rend="italic">(chit)</hi> and matter <hi rend="italic">(achit)</hi>; and God is the soul. On the religious side, Rãmãnuja adopts the tenets of the ancient Vishnuite Pãncharãtra sect, and, identifying the Brahman with Vishnu, combines with his theory the ordinary Vaishnava doctrine of periodical descents <hi rend="italic">(avatära) of</hi> the deity, in various</p><p>forms, for the benefit of creatures; and allowing considerable play to the doctrine that faith <hi rend="italic">(bhakti),</hi> not knowledge <hi rend="italic">(vidyα),</hi> is the means of final emancipation. This phase of Indian religious belief, which has attached itself to the Vedãnta theory more closely than to any other, makes its appearance very prominently in the <hi rend="italic">Bha-gαvαdgita,</hi> the episode of the <hi rend="italic">Mahabharata,</hi> already referred to— where, however, it attaches itself to Sãnkhya-yoga rather than to Vedanta tenets—and is even more fully developed in some of the Puranas, especially the Bhagavata. Some scholars would attribute this doctrine of fervid devotion to Christian influence, but it is already alluded to by Päçiini and in the <hi rend="italic">Mahabhäshya.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Sändilya- (Bhakti-) sütra</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="166"> Text, with Svapnesvara’s commentary, edited by J. R. Ballantyne; translated by E. B. Cowell. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>8 the author and date of which are unknown, the doctrine is systematically propounded in one hundred aphorisms. According to this doctrine mundane existence is due to want of faith, not to ignorance; and the final liberation of the individual soul can only be effected by faith. Knowledge only contributes to this end by removing the mind’s foulness, unbelief. Its highest phase of development this doctrine probably reached in the Vaishnava sect founded, towards the end of the 15th century, by Chaitanya, whose followers subsequently grafted the Vedãnta speculations on his doctrine. In opposition both to Sankara’s theory of absolute unity, and to Rãmãnuja’s doctrine of qualified unity—though leaning more towards the latter—Madhva Åchãrya, or Pûrçaprajna (a. ft. 1118-1198), started his <hi rend="italic">dvaita,</hi> or duality doctrine, according to which there is a difference between God and the human soul <hi rend="italic">(jiυa),</hi> as well as between God and nature; whilst the individual souls, which are innumerable, eternal, and indestructible, are likewise different from one another; but, though distinct, are yet united with God, like tree and sap, in an indissoluble union. This doctrine also identifies the Brahman with Vishnu, by the side of whom, likewise infinite, is the goddess Lakshmî, as Prakriti (nature), from whom inert matter <hi rend="italic">(jada)</hi> derives its energy. Here also <hi rend="italic">bhakti,</hi> devotion to God, is the saving element. A popular summary of the Vedãnta doctrine is the <hi rend="italic">Vedänta-sära</hi> by Sadananda, which has been frequently printed and translated.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="167"> Last by G.

In opposition to the Vedãnta school, which maintains the eternal coexistence of a spiritual principle of reality and an unspiritual principle of unreality, the Sãnkhya assumes the eternal coexistence of a material first cause, which it calls either <hi rend="italic">müla-Prakriti</hi> (fem.),“prime Originant” (Nature), or <hi rend="italic">Pradhäna,</hi> “ the principal ” cause, and a plurality of spiritual elements or Selves, <hi rend="italic">Purusha.</hi> The system recognizes no intelligent creator (such as the <hi rend="italic">Isvara,</hi> or demiurgus, of the Vedãnta)—whence it is called <hi rend="italic">niñévara,</hi> godless; but it conceives the Material First Cause, itself unintelligent, to have become developed, by a gradual process of evolution, into all the actual forms of the phenomenal universe, excepting the souls. Its first emanation is <hi rend="italic">buddhi,</hi> intelligence; whence springs <hi rend="italic">ahamkära,</hi> consciousness (or “ conscious mind-matter,” Davies) ; thence the subtle elements of material forms, viz. five elementary particles <hi rend="italic">(tanmätra)</hi> and eleven organs of sense; and finally, from the elementary particles, five elements. The souls have from all eternity been connected with Nature,—having in the first place become invested with a subtle frame <hi rend="italic">(linga-,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sükshma-, éañra),</hi> consisting of seventeen principles, viz. intelligence, consciousness, elementary particles, and organs of sense and action, including mind. To account for the spontaneous development of matter, the system assumes the latter to consist of three constituents (<hi rend="italic">guna</hi>) which are possessed of different qualities, viz. <hi rend="italic">sattva,</hi> of pleasing qualities, such as “ goodness,” lightness, luminosity; <hi rend="italic">rajas,</hi> of pain-giving qualities, such as “gloom,” passion, activity; and <hi rend="italic">tamas,</hi> of deadening qualities, such as “ darkness,” rigidity, dullness, and which, if not in a state of equipoise, cause unrest and development. Through all this course of development, the soul itself remains perfectly indifferent, its sole properties being those of purity and intelligence, and the functions usually regarded as “ psychic ” being due to the mechanical processes of the internal organs themselves evolved out of inanimate matter. Invested with its subtle frame, which accompanies it through the cycle of transmigration, the soul, for the sake of fruition, connects itself ever anew with Nature, thus, as it were, creating for itself ever new forms of material existence; and it is only on his attaining perfect knowledge, whereby the ever-changing modes of intelligence cease to be reflected on him, that the Purusha is liberated from the miseries of Saipsãra, and continues to exist in a state of absolute unconsciousness and detachment from matter. The existence of God, on the other hand, is denied by this theory, or rather considered as incapable of proof; the existence of evil and misery, for one thing, being thought incompatible with the notion of a divine origin of the world.</p><p>The reputed originator of this school is the sage Kapila, to whom tradition ascribes the composition of the fundamental text-book,</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0179" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0196.jp2"/><p>the (<hi rend="italic">Sãnkhya-sütra,</hi> or) <hi rend="italic">Sankhya-praυachana,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="169"> Translated by J.

But, though the founder would seem to have promulgated his system, in some form or other, at a very early period, these works, in their present form, have been shown to be quite modern productions, going probably not farther back than the 14th century of our era.

The <hi rend="italic">Yoga</hi> system is merely a schismatic branch of the preceding school, holding the same opinions on most points treated in common</p><p>in their Sütras, with the exception of one important point, the existence of God. To the twenty-five principles</p><p><hi rend="italic">(tattva)</hi> of the Nirïsvara Sãnkhya, the last of which was the <hi rend="italic">Purusha,</hi> the Yoga adds, as the twenty-sixth, the <hi rend="italic">Nirguna Purusha,</hi> or Self devoid of qualities, the Supreme God of the system. Hence the Yoga is called the <hi rend="italic">Sesvara</hi> (theistícal) <hi rend="italic">Sãnkhya.</hi> But over and above the purely speculative part of its doctrine, which it has adopted from the sister school, the theistic Sãnkhya has developed a complete system of mortification of the senses—by means of prolonged apathy and abstraction, protracted rigidity of posture, and similar practices,—many of which are already alluded to in the Upanishads, —with the view of attaining to complete concentration (yoga) on, and an ecstatic vision of, the Deity, and the acquisition of miraculous powers. It is from this portion of the system that the school derives the name by which it is more generally known. The authoritative Sutras of the Yoga, bearing the same title as those of the sister school, viz. <hi rend="italic">Sãnkhya-pravachana,</hi> but more commonly called <hi rend="italic">Yoga-sastra,</hi> are ascribed to Patañjalî, who is perhaps identical with the author of the “ great commentary ” on Panini. The oldest commentary on the Sutras, the <hi rend="italic">Pätañjala-bhashya,</hi> is attributed to no other than Vyãsa, the mythic arranger of the Veda and founder of the Vedanta. Both works have again been commented upon by Vãchaspati-misra, Vijñãna-bhikshu, and other writers.</p><p>5, 6. The <hi rend="italic">Nyãya</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="176"> Besides Colebrooke’s <hi rend="italic">Essay,</hi> with Cowell’s notes, see Ballantyne’s translation of the <hi rend="italic">Tarka-sangraha</hi> and the introduction to Röer’s translation of the <hi rend="italic">Bhashapaηchheda,</hi> and his article, <hi rend="italic">Z.D.M.G.</hi> xxi. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>and <hi rend="italic">Vaiéeshika</hi> are but separate branches of one and the same school, which supplement each other and the</p><p>doctrines of which have virtually become amalgamated into a single system of philosophy. The special part taken by each of the two branches in the elaboration of the system may be briefly stated in Dr Röer’s words :— “ To the Nyãya belong the logical doctrines of the forms of syllogisms, terms and propositions ; to the Vaiseshikas the systematical explanation of the categories (the simplest metaphysical ideas) of the metaphysical, physical and psychical notions— which notions are hardly touched upon in the Nyãya-sütras. They differ in their statement of the several modes of proof—the Nyãya asserting four modes of proof (from perception, inference, analogy and verbal communication), the Vaêieshikas admitting only the two first ones.” The term Nyãya <hi rend="italic">(ni-ãya,</hi> “ in-going,” entering), though properly meaning “ analytical investigation,” as applied to philo-sophical inquiry generally, has come to be taken more commonly in the narrower sense of “ logic,” because this school has entered more thoroughly than any other into the laws and processes of thought, and has worked out a formal system of</p><p>reasoning which forms the Hindu standard of logic.</p><p>The followers of these schools generally recognize seven categories</p><p><hi rend="italic">(padartha)</hi>: substance <hi rend="italic">(draυya),</hi> quality <hi rend="italic">(guna)</hi> action <hi rend="italic">(karma),</hi> generality <hi rend="italic">(sämänya),</hi> particularity <hi rend="italic">(υisesha),</hi> intimate relation <hi rend="italic">(samaυaya)</hi> and non-existence or negation <hi rend="italic">(abhaυa).</hi> Substances, forming the substrata of qualities and actions, are of two kinds; eternal (without a cause), viz. space, time, ether, soul and the atoms of mind, earth, water, fire and air; and non-eternal, comprising all compounds, or the things we perceive, and which must have a cause of their existence. Causality is of three kinds: that of intimate relation (material cause) ; that of non-intimate relation (between parts of a compound) ; and instrumental causality (effect -</p><p>ing the union of component parts). Material things are thus composed of atoms <hi rend="italic">(anu), i.e.</hi> ultimate simple substances, or units of space, eternal, unchangeable and without dimension, characterized only by “ particularity <hi rend="italic">(υisesha)."</hi> It is from this predication of ultimate “ particulars ” that the Vaiseshikas, the originators of the atomistic doctrine, derive their name. The Nyãya draws a clear line between matter and spirit, and has worked out a careful and ingenious system of psychology. It distinguishes between individual or living souls <hi rend="italic">(jïvätman),</hi> which are numerous, infinite and eternal, and the Supreme Soul <hi rend="italic">(Pararnãtrnan),</hi> which is one only, the seat of eternal knowledge, and the maker and ruler <hi rend="italic">(isυara)</hi> of all things. It is by his will and agency that the unconscious living souls (soul-atoms, in fact) enter into union with the (material) atoms of mind, &amp;amp;c., and thus partake of the pleasures and sufferings of mundane existence. On the Hindu syllogism compare Professor Cowell’s notes to Colebrooke’s <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> 2nd ed., i. p. 314.</p><p>The original collection of <hi rend="italic">Nyäya-sütras</hi> is ascribed to Gotama, and that of the <hi rend="italic">Vaiseshika-sütras</hi> to Kanãda. The etymological meaning of the latter name seems to be “ little-eater, particle-eater,” whence in works of hostile critics the synonymous terms <hi rend="italic">Kana-bhuj</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Kana-bhaksha</hi> are sometimes derisively applied to him, doubtless in allusion to his theory of atoms. He is also occasionally referred to under the name of Kãáyapa. Both sutra-works have been interpreted and supplemented by a number of writers, the commentary of Visvanãtha on the Nyãya and that of Sankara-misra on the Vaiseshika-sutras being most generally used. There are, moreover, a vast number of separate works on the doctrines of these schools, especially on logic. Of favourite elementary treatises on the subject may be mentioned Kesava-misra’s <hi rend="italic">Tarka-bhäshä,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">Tarka-sangraha</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="177"> Edited and translated by J.

Böhtlingk (1839-1840); and again with a German translation (1887). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>so called from its “ consisting of eight lectures <hi rend="italic">(adhyaya),"</hi> of four <hi rend="italic">pãdas</hi> each. For a comprehensive grasp of linguistic facts, and a penetrating insight into the structure of the vernacular language , this work stands probably unrivalled in the literature of any nation—though few other languages, it is true, afford such facilities as the Sanskrit for a scientific analysis. Panini’s system of arrangement differs entirely from that usually adopted in our grammars, viz. according to the so-called parts of speech. As the work is composed in aphorisms intended to be learnt by heart, economy of memory-matter was the author’s paramount consideration. His object was chiefly «attained by the grouping together of all cases exhibiting the same phonetic or formative feature, no matter whether or not they belonged to the same part of speech. For this purpose he also makes use of a highly artificial and ingenious system of algebraic symbols, consisting of technical letters <hi rend="italic">(anubandha),</hi> used chiefly with suffixes, and indicative of the changes which the roots or stems have to</p><p>undergo in word-formation.</p><p>It is self-evident that so complicated and complete a system of linguistic analysis and nomenclature could not have sprung up all at once and in the infancy of grammatical science, but that many generations of scholars must have helped to bring it to that degree of perfection which it exhibits in Panini’s work. Accordingly we find Panini himself making reference in various places to ten different grammarians, besides two schools, which he calls the “ eastern <hi rend="italic">(pranchas)"</hi> and “ northern <hi rend="italic">(udañchas)”</hi> grammarians. Perhaps the most important of his predecessors was Sãkatãyana,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="184"> <hi rend="italic">Le.</hi> son of Sakata, whence he is also called Sakatangaja. </note> also mentioned by Yãska—the author of the Nirukta, who is likewise supposed to have preceded Pãnini—as the only grammarian <hi rend="italic">(vaiyä-karana)</hi> who held with the etymologists <hi rend="italic">(nairukta)</hi> that all nouns are derived from verbal roots. Unfortunately there is little hope of the recovery of his grammar, which would probably have enabled us to determine somewhat more exactly to what extent Pãnini was indebted to the labours of his predecessors. There exists indeed a grammar in South Indian MSS., entitled <hi rend="italic">Sabdanuéãsana,</hi> which is ascribed to one Sãkatãyana;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="185"> Compare G. Bünler’s paper, <hi rend="italic">Orient und Occident,</hi> p. 691 seq. </note> but this has been proved<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="186"> A. Burnell, <hi rend="italic">On the Aiñdra School of Sanskrit Grammarians.</hi> </note> to be the production of a modern Jaina writer, which, however, seems to be partly based on the original work, and partly on Pãnini and others. Panini is also called Dakshiputra., after his mother Dãkshï. As his birthplace the village Sãlãtura is mentioned, which was situated some few miles north-west of the îndus, in the country of the Gan-dhãras, whence later writers also call him áãlãturïya, the formation of which name he himself explains in his grammar. Another name sometimes applied to him is Sãlanki. In the <hi rend="italic">Kathã-saritsagara,</hi> a modern collection of popular tales mentioned above, Pãnini is said to have been the pupil of Varsha, a teacher at Pataliputra, under the reign of Ñanda, the father (?) of Chandragupta (315-291 B.c.). The real date of t he great grammarian is, however, still a matter of uncertainty. While Goldstücker<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="187"> <hi rend="italic">Pãnini, his Place in Sanskrit Literature</hi> (1861). </note> attempted to put his date back to ante-Buddhist times (about the 7th century b.c.), Professor Weber held that Panini's grammar cannot have been composed till some time after the invasion of Alexander the Great. This opinion is chiefly based on the occurrence in one of the Sutras of the word <hi rend="italic">yavanani,</hi> in the sense of “ the writing of the Yavanas (Ionians),” thus implying, it would seem, such an acquaintance with the Greek alphabet as it would be impossible to assume for any period prior to Alexander's Indian campaign (326 B.c.). But, as it is by no means certain<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="188"> See Lassen, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Alt,</hi> i. p. 723; M. Müller, <hi rend="italic">Hist, of A,S, Lit.</hi> p. 521; A. Weber, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Stud.</hi> v. p. 2 seq. </note> that this term really applies to the Greek alphabet, it is scarcely expedient to make the word the corner-stone of the argument regarding Papim’s age. If Patañjali’s “great commentary” was written, as seems most likely, about the middle of the 2nd century b.c., it is hardly possible to assign to Panini a later date than about 400 B.c. Though this grammarian registers numerous words and formations as peculiar to the Vedic hymns, his chief concern is with the ordinary speech <hi rend="italic">(bhasha)</hi> of his period and its literature ; and it is noteworthy, in this respect, that the rules he lays down on some important points of syntax (as pointed out by Professors Bhandarkar and Kielhorn) are in accord with the practice of the Brãhmanas rather than with that of the later classical literature.</p><p>Pãnini’s Sutras continued for ages after to form the centre of grammatical activity. But, as his own work had superseded those of his predecessors, so many of the scholars who devoted themselves</p><p>to the task of perfecting his system have sunk into oblivion. The earliest of his successors whose work has come down to us (though perhaps not in a separate form) is Kãtyãyana, the author of a large collection of concise critical notes, called <hi rend="italic">Värttika,</hi> intended to supplement and correct the Sutras, or give them greater precision. The exact date of this writer is likewise unknown; but there can be little doubt that he lived at least a century after Panini. During the interval a new body of literature seems to have sprung up<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="189"> F. Kielhorn, <hi rend="italic">Kãtyãyana und Patañjali</hi> (1876). The <hi rend="italic">Sangraha</hi> a huge metrical work on grammar, by Vyadi, which is frequently referred to, doubtless belonged to this period. </note> —accompanied with considerable changes of language—and the geographical knowledge of India extended over large tracts towards the south. Whether this is the same Kãtyãyana to whom the Vãjasaneyi-prãtisãkhya (as well as the Sarvãnukrama) is attributed, is still doubted by some scholars.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="190"> <hi rend="italic">E.g.</hi> A. Weber. Goldstückerand M. Müller take the opposite view. </note> Kãtyãyana being properly a family or tribal name, meaning “ the descendant of Katya,’’ later works usually assign a second name Vararuchi to the writers (for there are at least two) who bear it. The Kathãsaritsãgara makes the author of the Vãrttikas a fellow-student of Pãnini, and afterwards the minister of King Nanda; but, though this date might have fitted Kãtyãyana well enough, it is impossible to place any reliance on the statements derived from such a source. Kãtyãyana was succeeded again, doubtless after a considerable interval, by Patañjali, the author of the <hi rend="italic">(Výäkarana-) Maha~bhashya,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="191"> Part of this work was first printed by Ballantyne ; followed by a lithographed edition, by two Benares pandits (1871) ; and a photolithographic edition of the text and commentaries, published by the India Office, under Goldstücker’s supervision (1874); finally, a critical edition by F. Kielhorn. For a review of the literary and antiquarian data supplied by the work, see A. Weber, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Stud.</hi> xiii. 293 seq. The author’s date has been frequently discussed, most thoroughly and successfully, by R. G. Bhandarkar in several papers. See also A. Weber, <hi rend="italic">Hist. of I.L.</hi> p. 223. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>or Great Commentary.</p><p>For the great variety of information it incidentally supplies regarding the literature and manners of the period, this is, from an historical and antiquarian point of view, one of the most important works of the classical Sanskrit literature. Fortunately the author’s date has been fairly settled by synchronisms implied in two passages of his work. In one of them the use of the imperfect—as the tense referring to an event, known to people generally, not witnessed by the speaker, and yet capable of being witnessed by him—is illustrated by the statement, “ The Yavana besieged Sãketa,” which there is reason to believe can only refer to the Indo-Bactrian king Menander (144- <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 124 B.c.), who, according to Strabo, extended his rule as far as the Yamuna.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="192"> Lassen, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Alt,</hi> ii. 341, 362. </note> In the other passage the use of the present is illustrated by the sentence, “ We are sacrificing for Pushpamitra ”—this prince (178- <hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 142 b.c.), the founder of the âunga dynasty, being known to have fought against the Greeks.We thus get the years 144-142 B.c. as the probable time when the work, or part of it, was composed. Although ratañjali probably gives not a few traditional grammatical examples mechanically repeated from his predecessors, those here mentioned are fortunately such as, from the very nature of the case, must have been made by himself. The Mahãbhãshya is not a continuous commentary on Panini’s grammar, but deals only with those Sutras (some 1720 out of a total of nearly 4000) on which Kãtyãyana had proposed any Vãrttikas, the critical discussionof which, in connexion with the respective Sutras, and with the views of other grammarians expressed thereon, is the sole object of Patañjali’s commentatorial remarks. Though doubts have been raised as to the textual condition of the work, Professor Kielhorn has clearly shown that it has probably been handed down in as good a state of preservation as any other classical Sanskrit work. Patañjali is also called Gonardïya—which name Professor Bhandarkar takes to mean “ a native of Gonarda,” a place, according to the same scholar, probably identical with Gonda, a town some 20 m. north-west of Oudh—and Gonikäputra, or son of Gonikã. Whether there is any connexion between this writer and the reputed author of the Yoga-sãstra is doubtful. The Mahãbhãshya has been commented upon by Kaiyata, in his <hi rend="italic">Bhãshyapradïpa,</hi> and the latter again by Nãgojî-bhatta, a distinguished grammarian of the earlier part of the 18th century, in his <hi rend="italic">Bhãshya-pradìpoddyota.</hi></p><p>Of running commentaries on Päçtini’s Sutras, the oldest extant and most important is the <hi rend="italic">KäHkä Vzitti,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="193"> Edited by Pandit Bala Sãstrî (Benares, 1876-1878). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>or “ comment of Kasi (Benares),” the joint production of two Jaina writers of probably the first half of the 7th century, viz.

Lexicography.—Sanskrit dictionaries <hi rend="italic">(kosha),</hi> invariably composed in verse, are either homonymous or synonymous; or partly the one and partly the other. Of those hitherto published, Sãsvata’s <hi rend="italic">Anekartha-samuchchaya</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="206"> Edited by Th. Zachariae. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>or “ collection of homonyms,” is probably the oldest. While in the later homonymic vocabularies the words are usually arranged according to the alphabetical order of the final (or sometimes the initial) letter, and then according to the number of syllables, Sãsvata’s principle</p><p>of arrangement—viz. the number of meanings assignable to a word— seems to be the more primitive. The work probably next in time is the famous <hi rend="italic">Amara-kosha</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="207"> Edited by H. T. Colebrooke (1808), and by L. Deslongchamps (1839-1845). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>(“immortal treasury”) by Amara-simha, one of “ the nine gems,” who probably lived early in the 6th century. This dictionary consists of a synonymous and a short homonymous part; whilst in the former the words are distributed in sections according to subjects, as heaven and the gods, time and seasons, &amp;amp;c., in the latter they are arranged according to their final letter, without regard to the number of syllables. This Kosha has found many commentators, the oldest of those known being Kshìra-svãmin.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="208"> A grammarian of this name is mentioned as the tutor of King Jayãpida of Kashmir (a.d. 755-786); but Kshïra, the commentator on Amara, is placed by Professor Aufrecht between the 11th and 12th centuries, because he quotes the Sabdãnuéãsana ascribed to Bhojarãja. </note> Among the works quoted by commentators as Amara's sources are the <hi rend="italic">Trikända</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Utpalinï-koshas,</hi> and the glossaries of Rabhasa, Vyãdî, Kãtyãyana, and Vararuchi. A Kosha ascribed to Vararuchi—whom tradition makes likewise one of the nine literary “ gems ”—consisting of ninety short sections, has been printed at Benares (1865) in a collection of twelve Koshas. The <hi rend="italic">Abhidhäna-ratnamälä,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="209"> Edited by Th. Aufrecht (1861). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>by Halayudha ; the <hi rend="italic">Visvaprakaéa,</hi> by Mahesvara (1111) ; and the <hi rend="italic">AbhMhana-chintärnam</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="210"> Edited by O. Böhtlingk and C. Rieu (1847). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>(or <hi rend="italic">Haima-kosha)</hi>, by the Jaina Hemachandra, seem all three to belong to the 12th century. Some-what earlier than these probably is Ajaya Pãla, the author of the (homonymous) <hi rend="italic">Nänärtha-sangraha,</hi> being quoted by Vardhamãna (a.d. 1140). Of more uncertain date is Purushottama Deva, who wrote the <hi rend="italic">Trikända-sesha,</hi> a supplement to the Amarkosha, besides the <hi rend="italic">Härävali,</hi> a collection of uncommon words, and two other short glossaries. Of numerous other works of this class the most important is the <hi rend="italic">Medini,</hi> a dictionary of homonyms, arranged in the first place according to the finals and the syllabic length, and then alphabetically. Two important dictionaries, compiled by native scholars of the last century, are the <hi rend="italic">Sabdakalpadruma</hi> by Rãdhãkãnta Deνa, and the <hi rend="italic">Vächaspatya,</hi> by Täranãtha Tarka-vãchaspati. A full account of Sanskrit dictionaries is contained in the preface to the first edition of H. H. Wilson’s <hi rend="italic">Dictionary,</hi> reprinted in his <hi rend="italic">Essays on Sanskrit Literature,</hi> vol. iii.</p><p>V. Prosody <hi rend="italic">(Chhandas).—</hi> The oldest treatises on prosody have already been referred to in the account of the technical branches of the later Vedic literature. Among more modern treatises the most important are the <hi rend="italic">Mrita-sanjivani,</hi> a commentary on Pingala’s Sutra, by Halãyudha (perhaps identical with the author of the glossary above referred to); the <hi rend="italic">Vritta-ratnäkara,</hi> or “ jewel-mine of metres,” in six chapters, composed before the 13th century by Kedära Bhatta, with several commentaries; and the <hi rend="italic">Chhando-manjarï,</hi> likewise in six chapters, by Gangädäsa. The <hi rend="italic">Srutabodha,</hi> ascribed, probably wrongly, to the great Kãlidãsa, is a comparatively insignificant treatise which deals only with the more common metres, in such a way that each stanza forms a specimen of the metre it describes. The <hi rend="italic">Vritta-darpαna</hi> treats chiefly of Prãkrit metres. Sanskrit prosody, which is probably not surpassed by any other either in variety of metre or in har-moniousness of rhythm, recognizes two classes of metres, viz. such as consist of a certain number of syllables of fixed quantity, and such as are regulated by groups of breves or metrical instants, this latter class being again of two kinds, according as it is or is not bound by a fixed order of feet. A pleasant account of Sanskrit poetics is given in Colebrooke’s <hi rend="italic">Essays,</hi> vol. ii. ; a more complete and systematic one by Professor Weber, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Stud,</hi> vol. viii.</p><p>VI. Music (Sαngi∕α).—The musical art has been practised in India from early times. The theoretic treatises on profane music now extant are, however, quite modern productions.</p><p>The two most highly esteemed works are the <hi rend="italic">Sangïta-ratnäkara ("</hi> jewel-mine of music ”), by Sãrngadeva, and the <hi rend="italic">Sangιta-darpana</hi> (“ mirror of music ”), by Dãmodara. Each of these works consists of seven chapters, treating respectively of—(1) sound and musical notes (svara); (2) melodies <hi rend="italic">(raga);</hi> (3) music in connexion with the human voice (<hi rend="italic">prakirnaka)</hi>; (4) musical compositions <hi rend="italic">(prabandha)</hi>; (5) time and measure (tala); (6) musical instruments and instrumental music <hi rend="italic">(υadya);</hi> (7) dancing and acting (nritta or <hi rend="italic">nritya).</hi> The Indian octave consists like our own of seven chief notes (<hi rend="italic">sυara);</hi> but, while with us it is subdivided into twelve semi-tones, the Hindu theory distinguishes twenty-two intervals (<hi rend="italic">sruti,</hi> audible sound). There is, however, some doubt as to whether these <hi rend="italic">srutis</hi> are quite equal to one another—in which case the intervals between the chief notes would be unequal, since they consist of either two or three or four <hi rend="italic">srutis,</hi> —or whether, if the intervals between the chief notes be equal, the <hi rend="italic">srutis</hi> themselves vary in duration between quarter-, third-, and semi-tones. There are three scales <hi rend="italic">(grama),</hi> differing from each other in the nature of the chief intervals (either as regards actual duration, or the number of srutis or sub-tones). Indian music consists almost entirely in melody, instrumental accompaniment being performed in unison, and any attempt at harmony being confined to the continuation of the key-note. A</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0182" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0199.jp2"/><p>number of papers, by various writers, nave been reprinted with additional remarks on the subject, in Sourindro Mohun Tagore’s <hi rend="italic">Hindu Music</hi> (Calcutta, 1875). Compare also Bh. A. Pingle, <hi rend="italic">Indian Music,</hi> 2nd ed. (Bombay 1898 <hi rend="italic">)._</hi></p><p>VII. Rhetoric <hi rend="italic">(Alankära-sästra).—</hi> Treatises on the theory of literary composition are very numerous. Indeed, a subject of this description—involving such nice distinctions as regards the various kinds of poetic composition, the particular subjects and characters adapted for them, and the different scntiments or mental conditions capable of being both depictured and called forth by them—could not but be congenial to the Indian mind. H. H. Wilson, in his <hi rend="italic">Theatre of the Hindus,</hi> has given a detailed account of these theoretic distinctions with special reference to the drama, which, as the most perfect and varied kind of poetic production, usually takes an important place in the theory of literary composition. The <hi rend="italic">Bharata-éãstra</hi> has already been alluded to as probably the oldest extant work in this department of literature. Another comparatively ancient treatise is the <hi rend="italic">Kãvyãdarsa</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="211"> Edited, with commentary, by Premachandra Tarkabagisa, <hi rend="italic">Bibl. Ind.</hi>; with German translation by O. v. Böhtlingk (1890). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>or "mirror of poetry,” in three chapters, by Dandin, the author of the novel <hi rend="italic">Dasakumäracharita,</hi> who probably flourished towards the end of the 6th century. The work consists of three chapters, treating— (I) of two different local styles <hi rend="italic">(riti)</hi> of poetry, the Gaudi or eastern and the Vaîdarbhï or southern (to which later critics add four others, the Pãñchãlï, Mãgadhï, Lãtï, and Ãvantikã) ; (2) of the graces and ornaments of style, as tropes, figures, similes; (3) of alliteration, literary puzzles and twelve kinds of faults to be avoided in composing poems. Another treatise on rhetoric, in Sutras, with a commentary entitled <hi rend="italic">Kavyalαnkarα-υrJtti,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="212"> Edited by Capeller (1875). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>is ascribed to Vãmana of probably the 8th century.

The Dasarupa was early commented upon by Dhanika, possibly the author’s own brother, their father’s name being the same (Vishnu).

The <hi rend="italic">Sarasvati-kanthäbharana,</hi> “ the neck-ornament of Sarasvatï (the goddess of eloquence),” a treatise, in five chapters, on poetics generally, remarkable for its wealth oof quotations, is ascribed to King Bhoja himself (11th century), probably as a compliment by some writer patronized by him.

Medicine <hi rend="italic">(Äyur·veda, Vaidyα-sastrα).—</hi> Though the early cultivation of the healing art is amply attested by frequent allusions in the Vedic writings, it was doubtless not till a much later period that the medical practice advanced beyond a certain degree of empirical skill and pharmaceutic routine. From the simultaneous mention of the three humours (wind, bile, phlegm) in a vãrttika to Panini (v. 1, 38), some kind of humoral pathology would, however, seem to have been prevalent among Indian physicians several centuries before our era. The oldest existing work is supposed to be the <hi rend="italic">Charaka-samhitä</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="217"> Edited by Jibananda Vîdyasagara (Calcutta, 1877). Cf. A. F. R. Hoernle, "Studies in Anc. Indian Medicine ” (7. <hi rend="italic">Roy. As. 5.</hi> 1906-9). </note> a bulky cyclopaedia in slokas, mixed with prose sections, which consists of eight chapters, and was probably composed for the most part in the early centuries of our era. Whether the Chinese tradition which makes Charaka the court physician of King Kanishka (c. a.d. 100) rests on fact is very doubtful. Of equal authority, but doubtless somewhat more modern, is the <hi rend="italic">Susruta (-samhitä),</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="218"> Edited by Madhusudana Gupta (1835-1837), and by Jibananda Vidyasagara (1873). </note> <hi rend="italic"/>which Susruta is said to have received from Dhanvantari, the Indian Aesculapius, whose name, however, appears also among the “ nine gems.” It consists</p><p>of six chapters, and is likewise composed in mixed verse and prose— the greater simplicity of arrangement, as well as some slight attention paid in it to surgery, betokening an advance upon Charaka. Both works are, however, characterized by great prolixity, and contain much matter which has little connexion with medicine. The late Professor E. Haas, in two very suggestive papers,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="219"> <hi rend="italic">Z.D.M.G.</hi> (1876), p. 617 seq.; (1877), p. 647 seq. </note> tried to show that the work of Susruta (identified by him with Socrates, so often confounded in the middle ages with Hippocrates) was probably not composed till after the Mohammedan conquest, and that, so far from the Arabs (as they themselves declare) having derived some of their knowledge of medical science from Indian authorities, the Indian Vaidyasastra was nothing but a poor copy of Greek medicine, as transmitted by the Arabs. But even though Greek influence may be traced in this as in other branches of Indian science, there can be no doubt,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="220"> See Professor Aug. Müller’s paper, <hi rend="italic">Z.D.M.G.</hi> (1880), p. 465. </note> at any rate, that both Charaka and Susruta were known to the Arab Rãzï <hi rend="italic">(c.</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d. 932), and to the author of the Fihrist (completed</hi> A.D. 987), and that their works must therefore have existed, in some form or other, at least as early as the 9th century. Among the numerous later medical works published and greatly esteemed in lndia, the most important general compendiums are Vãgbhata’s <hi rend="italic">Ashtanga-hridayα, "</hi> the heart of the eight-limbed (body of medical science),” supposed to have been written in the 9th century, or still earlier; and Bhãva Misra's <hi rend="italic">Bhaυa-prakdiα,</hi> probably of the early part of the 16th century; while of special treatises may be mentioned Mãdhava’s system of pathology, the <hi rend="italic">Rugvinischaya,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Mädhava-Nidãna,</hi> of the 8th or 9th century; and Sarngadhara’s compendium of therapeutics, the <hi rend="italic">Sãrngadhara-samhitä,</hi> composed before 1300, having been commented upon by Vopadeva. Materia medica, with which India is so lavishly en-dowed by nature, is a favourite subject with Hindu medical writers, the oldest treatise being apparently the <hi rend="italic">Dhanvantari-nighantu,</hi> of uncertain, but not very high, age; besides which may be mentioned Madanapãla’s <hi rend="italic">Madanaυinοda,</hi> written A.D. 1374; the more modern <hi rend="italic">Raja-nighantu,</hi> by the Kashmirian Narahari; besides other, still more recent esteemed works of this class, to which may be added the valuable medical dictionary <hi rend="italic">Vaidyakasabdasindhu</hi> by Umesa-chandra Gupta. A useful general view of this branch of Indian science is contained in T. A. Wise’s <hi rend="italic">Commentary on Hindu Medicine</hi> (1845), and in his <hi rend="italic">History of Medicine,</hi> vol. i. (1867); but the subject has since then been treated in a much fuller and more critical way in Professor J. Jolly’s “ Medicin ” in Bühler’s <hi rend="italic">Grundriss der indο-arischen Philologie,</hi></p><p>IX. Astronomy and Mathematics.—Hindu astronomy may be broadly divided into a pre-scientific and a scientific period. While the latter clearly presupposes a knowledge of the researches of Hipparchus and other Greek astronomers, it is still doubtful whether the earlier astronomical and astrological theories of Indian writers were entirely of home growth or partly derived from foreign sources.</p><p>From very ancient (probably Indo-European) times chronological calculations were based on the synodical revolutions of the moon—the difference between twelve such revolutions (making together 354 days) and the solar year being adjusted by the insertion, at the time of the winter solstice, of twelve additional days. Besides this primitive mode the Rigveda also alludes to the method prevalent in post-Vedic times, according to which the year is divided into twelve <hi rend="italic">(sãvana</hi> or solar) months of thirty days, with a thirteenth month intercalated every fifth year. This quinquennial cycle (<hi rend="italic">yuga</hi>), is explained in the <hi rend="italic">Jyοtisha,</hi> regarded as the oldest astronomical treatise. An institution which occupies an important part in those early speculations is the theory of the so-called lunar zodiac, or system of lunar mansions, by which the planetary path, in accordance with the duration of the moon’s rotation, is divided into twenty-seven or twenty-eight different stations, named after certain constellations <hi rend="italic">(nαkshatra)</hi> which are found alongside of the ecliptic, and with which the moon (masc.) was supposed to dwell successively during his circuit. The same institution is found in China and Arabia; but it is still doubtful<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="221"> See especially Professor Whitney’s essay on the Lunar Zodiac, in his <hi rend="italic">Oriental and Linguistic Studies.</hi> </note> whether the Hindus, as some scholars hold, or the Chaldaeans, as Professor Weber thinks, are to be credited with the invention of this theory. Professor G. Thibaut,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="222"> G. Thibaut, “Astronomie, Astrologie und Mathematik,”in Bühler’s <hi rend="italic">Grundriss.</hi> </note> who has again thoroughly investigated the problem, comes to the conclusion that it is improbable that the nakshatra-theory arose independently in India, but that it is still doubtful whence the Hindus derived it. The principal works of this period are hitherto known from quotations only, viz. the Gargi <hi rend="italic">Samhitä,</hi> which Professor Kern would fix at <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 50 B.c., the <hi rend="italic">Näradi Samhitä</hi> and others.</p><p>The new era, which the same scholar dates from <hi rend="italic">c.</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d. 250, is marked by the appearance of the five original Siddhãntas (partly extant in revised redactions and</hi> in quotations), the very names of two of which suggest Western influence, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Paitämaha-, Suryα-,</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="223"> The <hi rend="italic">Surya-siddhänta,</hi> translated by (W.

In the works of several of these writers, from Aryabhata onwards, special attention is paid to mathematical (especially arithmetical and algebraic) computations; and the respective chapters of Bhaskara’s compendium, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Lïlãvatï</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vïja-ganita</hi>,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="226"> A translation of both treatises, as well as of the respective chapters of Brahma-gupta's work, was published (1817) by H. T. Colebrooke, with an important “ Dissertation on the Algebra of the Hindus,” reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Misc.

The question whether Aryabhata was acquainted with the researches of the Greek algebraist Diophantus (c. <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d. 360) remains still unsettled, but, even if this was the case, algebraic science seems to have been carried by him beyond the point attained by the Greeks.</hi></p><p>On Sanskrit literature generally may be consulted Max Müller, <hi rend="italic">History of Ancient Sanskrit Literature·,</hi> A Weber, <hi rend="italic">History of Indian Literature·,</hi> A.
