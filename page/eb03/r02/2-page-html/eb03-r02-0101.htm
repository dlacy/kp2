<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">peaτed </span><span class="font0">in London in 1735, in 8vo. They conſiſt of odes in blank verſe, elegies, ſongs, and other things,&nbsp;after the manner of Catullus. There is likewiſe, by&nbsp;him, a Collection of Epigrams, printed at Florence in&nbsp;1776, in 8vo, and preceded with his life by the abbé&nbsp;Fondini. What Martial ſaid of his own Collection&nbsp;may be ſaid of this, “ That there are few good, but&nbsp;many indifferent or bad, pieces in it.” Rolli, however,&nbsp;bore the character of one of the beſt Italian poets of&nbsp;his age. During his ſtay in London, he procured editions of ſeveral authors, of his own country. The&nbsp;principal of theſe were, the Satires of Arioſto, the&nbsp;Burleſque Works of Berni, Varchi, 8tc. 2 vols, in 8vo,&nbsp;which poſſeſs conſiderable merit. The Decameron of&nbsp;Boccace, 1727, in 4t0 and folio; in which he has&nbsp;faithfully copied the celebrated and valuable edition&nbsp;publiſhed by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſſantes</span><span class="font0"> in ι Ç27 : and, laſtly, of the elegant Lucretia of Marchetti, which, after the manuſcript was reviſed, was printed at London in 1 717, in&nbsp;Svo, through the influence and attention of Rolli.&nbsp;This edition is beautiful ; but the work is thought of&nbsp;pernicious tendency. There are likewiſe, by him,&nbsp;tranſlations into Italian verſe of the Paradiſe Loſt of&nbsp;Milton, printed at London in folio in 1735’ ; and of the&nbsp;Odes of Anacreon, London 1739, in 8vo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROLLIN (Charles), a juſtly celebrated French writer, was the ſon of a cutler at Paris, and was born&nbsp;there on the 30th of January 1661. He ſtudied at&nbsp;the college Du Pleſſis, in which he obtained a burſary&nbsp;through the intereſt of a Benedictine monk of the&nbsp;White Mantle, whom he had ſerved at table, and who&nbsp;diſcovered in him ſome marks of genius. Here he acquired the regard of M. Gobinet, principal of that college, who had a particular eſteem for him. After having ſtudied humanity and philoſophy at the college of&nbsp;Du Pleſſis, he applied to divinity three years at the&nbsp;Sorbonne ; but he did not proſecute this ſtudy, and&nbsp;never roſe in the church higher than to the rank of a&nbsp;tonſured prieſt. He afterwards became profeſſor of&nbsp;rhetoric in the ſame college ; and, in 1688, ſucceeded Horſan, his maſter, as profeſſor of eloquence, in the&nbsp;royal college. No man. ever exerciſed the functions of&nbsp;it with greater eclat : he often made Latin orations,&nbsp;to celebrate the memorable events of the times ; and&nbsp;frequently accompanied them with poems, which were&nbsp;read and eſteemed by every body. In ‘69 4, he was&nbsp;choſen rector of the univerſity ; and continued in that&nbsp;office two years, which was then a great mark of diſtinction. By virtue of his office, he ſpoke the annual&nbsp;panegyric upon Louis XIV. He made many very&nbsp;&quot;uſeful regulations in the univerſity ; and particularly&nbsp;revived the ſtudy of the Greek language, which was&nbsp;then much neglected. He ſubſtituted academical exerciſes in the place of tragedies ; and introduced the&nbsp;practice which had been formerly obſerved, of cauſing&nbsp;the ſtudents to get by heart paſſages of Scripture.&nbsp;He was a man of indefatigable attention ; and trained&nbsp;innumerable perſons, who did honour to the church, the&nbsp;ſtate, and the army. The firſt preſident Portail was&nbsp;phaſed one day to reproach Rollin in a jocular ſtrain,&nbsp;as if he exceeded even himſelf in doing buſineſs : to&nbsp;whom Rollin replied, with that plainneſs and ſincerity&nbsp;which was natural to him, “ It becomes you well, Sir,&nbsp;to reproach me with this ; it is this habit of labour&nbsp;in me which has diſtinguiſhed you in the place of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">advocate-general, which has raiſed you to that of firſt preſident : you owe the greatneſs of your fortune to&nbsp;me.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon the expiration of the rectorſliip, cardinal No-ailles engaged him to ſuperintend the ſtudies of his nephews, who were in the college of Laon ; and in this&nbsp;office he was agreeably employed, when, in 1699, he&nbsp;was with great reluctance made coadjutor to the principal of the college of Beauvais. This college was then&nbsp;a kind of deſert, inhabited by very few ſtudents, and&nbsp;without any manner of diſcipline : but Rollin’« great&nbsp;reputation and induſtry ſoon re-peopled it, and made&nbsp;it that flouriſhing ſociety it has ever ſince continued.&nbsp;In this ſituation he continued till 1712 ; when the war&nbsp;between the Jeſuits and the Janſeniſts drawing towards&nbsp;a criſis, he ſell a ſacriſice to the prevalence of the former. Father le Tellſer, the king’s conſeſſor, a furious agent of the Jeſuits, infuſed into his maſter prejudices againſt Rollin, whoſe connections with cardinal&nbsp;de Noailles would alone have ſufficed to have made him&nbsp;a Janſeniſt ; and on this account he loſt his ſhare in the&nbsp;principality of Beauvais. No man, however, could&nbsp;have loſt leſs in this than Rollin, who had every thine»·&nbsp;left him that was neceſſary to make him happy ; retirement, books, and enough to live on. He now began to be employed upon Quinctilian ; an author he&nbsp;juſtly valued, and ſaw neglected not without uueaſt-neſs. He retrenched in him whatever he thought rather curious than uſeful for the inſtruction of youth ;&nbsp;he placed ſummaries or contents at the head of each&nbsp;chapter ; and he accompanied the text with ſhort ſelect notes. His edition appeared in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1</span><span class="font0">7 ∙ 5, in 2 vols&nbsp;12 mo, with an elegant preface, ſetting forth his method and views.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1710, the univerſity of Paris, willing to have a head ſuitable to the importance of their intereſts in the&nbsp;then critical conjuncture of affairs, choſe Rollin again&nbsp;rector : but he was diſplaced in about two months by&nbsp;a lettre de cachet. The univerſity had preſented to the&nbsp;parliament a petition, in which it proteſted againſt taking any part in the adjuſtment of the late diſputes;&nbsp;and their being congratulated in a public oration by&nbsp;Rollin on this ſtep, occaſioned the letter which ordered&nbsp;them to chooſe a rector of more moderation. Whatever the univerſity might ſuffer by the removal of Rollin, the public was probably a gainer ; for he now applied himſelf to compoſe his treatiſe upon the Manner&nbsp;of Studying and Teaching the Belles Lettres, which&nbsp;was publiſhed, two volumes in 1726, and two more&nbsp;in 1728, 8vo∙</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This work has been juſtly eſteemed for the ſentiments of religion which animate its author, whoſe zeal for the&nbsp;public good prompted him to ſelect the choiceſt paſſages of Greek and Latin authors. The ſtyle is ſufficiently elegant, but the language on ſome occaſions is&nbsp;not remarkable ſor delicacy; and in the book altogether&nbsp;there is neither much order nor depth. The author&nbsp;has indeed ſpoken of common things agreeably, and has&nbsp;ſpoken as an orator on ſubjects which demanded the inveſtigation of the philoſopher. One can ſcarcely reduce any thing in him to principles.—For example, the&nbsp;three ſpecies of eloquence ; the ſimple, the temperate, and the ſublime, can ſcarcely be underſtood from&nbsp;him when we read that the one reſembles a frugal table;&nbsp;the ſecond abeautiful ruin, with green wood growing</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
