With the death, in 1716, of Christina Malatesta, the wife of Niccolo Boldu, the Rimini branch of the family became extinct. The descendants of Giovanni, brother of Malatesta da Verrucchio, who married one of the Sogliano, were known as the Sogliano-Malatesta. The representatives of this branch settled in Rome.</p><p>The history of Rimini practically ends with its independence. It fell into obscurity under the rule of the popes, and was not again mentioned in history until, in 1831 and 1845, it took a prominent part in the revolutionary movements against papal despotism and in favour of Italian independence. Although Rimini, like many other cities of Romagna, is now harassed by republican and socialistic sects, it is a thriving town and enjoys increasing prosperity. It had in 1881 a population of 37,248 souls, being the centre of a district containing 88,110 inhabitants, and is part of the province of Forli, which, divided into the three districts of Cesena, Forli, and Rimini, has a total population of 252,883 souls. Many small manufactures are carried on at Rimini, but agriculture is its principal resource, and its produce in corn and wine is considerably in excess of the local consumption. Its seabathing establishment attracts many visitors during the summer months, and conduces to the prosperity of the town. Rimini also boasts a good public library of 28,000 volumes, inclusive of 850 MSS.; and it has a record office containing several thousand ancient MSS.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Authorities.—</hi>Moroni, <hi rend="italic">Diziouario di erudizione stoηco-eeelesi-astiea</hi>  (vol. lvii., <hi rend="italic">s.v.</hi>  “Rimini”); Ch.

The enlarged part of a ring on which the device is engraved is called the “ bezel,” the rest of it being the “ hoop.”</p><p>The earliest existing rings are naturally those found in the tombs of ancient Egypt. The finest examples date from about the 18th to the 20th dynasty ; they are of pure gold, simple in design, very heavy and massive, and have usually the name and titles of the owner deeply sunk in hieroglyphic characters on an oblong gold bezel. Rings worn in Egypt by the poorer classes were made of less costly materials, such as silver, bronze, glass, or pottery covered with a siliceous glaze and coloured brilliant blue or green with various copper oxides. Some of these had hieroglyphic inscriptions impressed while the clay was moist. Other examples have been found made of ivory, amber, and hard stones, such as carnelian. Another form of ring used under the later dynasties of Egypt had a scarab in place of the bezel, and was mounted on a gold hoop which passed through the hole in the scarab and allowed it to revolve.</p><p>In ancient Babylonia and Assyria finger ring3 do not appear to have been used. In those countries the signet took a different form, namely, that of a cylinder cut in crystal or other hard stone, and perforated from end to end. A cord was passed through it, and it was worn on the wrist like a bracelet. This way of wearing the signet is more than once alluded to in the Old Testament (Gen. xxxviii. 18, Revised Version, and Cant, viii. 6).</p><p>The Etruscans used very largely the gold swivel ring mounted with a scarab, a form of signet probably introduced from Egypt. Some found in Etruscan tombs have real Egyptian scarabs with legible hieroglyphs ; others, probably the work of Phoenician or native engravers, have rude copies of hieroglyphs, either quite or partially illegible. A third and more numerous class of Etruscan signet rings have scarabs, cut usually in sard or carnelian, which are a link between the art of Egypt and that of Greece, the design cut on the flat side being Hellenic in style, while the back is shaped like the ordinary Egyptian scarabæus beetle.</p><p>Among the Greeks signet rings were very largely worn, and were usually set with engraved gems. In Sparta a sumptuary law was passed at an early time to forbid any substance more valuable than iron to be used for signet rings ; but in other parts of the Hellenic world there appears to have been no restriction of this sort. In some of the numerous tombs of Etruria and Kertch (Panti-capæum) in the Cimmerian Bosphorus gold rings of great magnificence have been discovered, apparently of the finest Greek workmanship. One from Etruria, now in the British Museum, is formed by two minutely modelled lions whose bodies form the hoop, while their paws hold the bezel, a scarab engraved with a lion of heraldic character. Many other examples of this design have been found, some of which are among the finest existing specimens of Hellenic or Græco-Etruscan jewellery. Another remarkable specimen from an Etruscan tomb is of Etrusco-Latin work. The hoop of the ring is formed by two minute gold figures of Hercules and Juno Sospita, the stone being set between their heads. Many of the Greek rings are of thin repoussé gold, so as to make the most show for the least cost ; one fine example, early in date, has its hoop formed of two dolphins, holding a plain white stone.</p><p>The Romans appear to have imitated the simplicity of Lacedæmonia. Throughout the republic none but iron rings were worn by the bulk of the citizens. Ambassadors were the first who were privileged to wear gold rings, and then only while performing some public duty. Next senators, consuls, équités, and all the chief officers of state received the <hi rend="italic">pis annuli aurei.</hi>  One early Roman ring of the highest historical interest still exists ; it belonged to Cornelius Scipio Barbatus, consul in 298 B.c., in whose sarcophagus, now in the Vatican, it was found in 1780.@@<hi rend="sup">2 </hi>It is of plain rudely hammered gold, and is set with an intaglio on sard of a figure of Victory, purely Roman in style, dating before 300 b.c. In the Augustan age many valuable collections of antique rings were made, and were frequently offered as gifts in the temples of Rome. One of the largest and most valuable of the<hi rend="italic">dactyliothecæ</hi>  was dedicated in the temple of Apollo Palatinus by Augustus’s nephew Marcellus, who had formed the collection (Pliny, <hi rend="italic">H.</hi><hi rend="italic">N</hi>., xxxvii. 5). The temple of Concord in the Forum contained another ; among this latter collection was the celebrated ring of Polycrates, king of Samos, the story of which is told by Herodotus (see vol. xix. p. 417); Pliny, however, doubts the authenticity of this relic (77. JV., xxxvii. 2).</p><p>Different laws as to the wearing of rings existed during the empire : Tiberius made a large property qualification necessary for the wearing of gold rings ; Severus conceded the right to all Roman soldiers ; and later still all free citizens possessed theyws <hi rend="italic">annuli aurei,</hi>  silver rings being</p><lb/><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Compare Gems, vol. x. p. 136.</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> This ring afterwards passed into the Beverley collection.</p></body></text></TEI>
