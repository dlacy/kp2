<p><span class="font0">Upon the departure of theſe troops, ſome of the Epirots, imagining that the camp was taken, began to loſe courage, and retire ; thoſe who were next to them followed their example, and in a ſhort time the whole army gave way. Pyrrhus having attempted ſeveral times&nbsp;in vain to rally his forces, returned to the charge with&nbsp;a ſmall number of his friends and the moſt courageous&nbsp;of his officers. With theſe he ſuſtained the fury of the&nbsp;victorious legions, and covered the retreat of his own&nbsp;men. But being, after a moſt gallant behaviour, dan-gerouſly wounded, he retired at laſt with his ſmall band&nbsp;in good order, leaving the Romans maſters of the field.&nbsp;As the ſun was near ſetting, the Romans, being extremely fatigued, and a great number of them wounded, the conſul Sulpicius, not thinking it adviſable to&nbsp;purſue the enemy, founded a retreat, repaſſed the ſtream,&nbsp;and brought his troops back to the camp. Sulpicius&nbsp;appeared in the field of battle the next day, with a deſign to bring the Epirots to a ſecond engagement ; but&nbsp;finding they had withdrawn in the night to Tarentum,&nbsp;he likewiſe retired, and put his troops into winter-quarters in Apulia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Both armies continued quiet in their quarters during winter ; but early in the ſpring took the field anew.—&nbsp;The Romans were commanded this year by two men&nbsp;of great ſame, whom they had raiſed to the conſulate&nbsp;the ſecond time : theſe were the celebrated C. Fabri-cius and Æmilius Pappus ; who no ſooner arrived&nbsp;in Apulia, than they led their troops into the territory&nbsp;of Tarentum. Pyrrhus, who had received conſiderable&nbsp;reinforcements from Epirus, met them near the frontiers, and encamped at a ſmall diſtance from the Roman army. While the conſuls were waiting here for a&nbsp;favourable opportunity to give battle, a meſſenger from&nbsp;Nicias, the king’s phyſician, delivered a letter to Fabri-cius ; wherein the traitor offered to take off his maſter&nbsp;by poifon, provided the conſul would promiſe him a&nbsp;reward proportionable to the greatneſs of the ſervice.&nbsp;The virtuous Roman, being filled with horror at the&nbsp;bare propoſal of ſuch a crime, immediately communicated the affair to his colleague ; who readily joined with&nbsp;him in writing a letter to Pyrrhus, wherein they warned him, without diſcovering the criminal, to take care&nbsp;of himſelf, and be upon his guard againſt the treacherous deſigns of thoſe about him. Pyrrhus, out of a&nbsp;deep ſenſe of gratitude for ſo great a benefit, releaſed&nbsp;immediately, without ranſom, all the priſoners he had&nbsp;taken. But the Romans, diſdaining to accept either&nbsp;a ſavour from an enemy, or a recompenſe for not committing the blackeſt treachery, declared, that they&nbsp;would not receive their priſoners but by way of exchange ; and accordingly ſent to Pyrrhus an equal number of Samnite and Tarentine priſoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the king of Epirus grew every day more weary oſa war which he feared would end </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">his diſgrace, he&nbsp;ſent Cyneas a ſecond time to Rome, to try whether he&nbsp;could, with his artful harangues, prevail upon the con-ſeript fathers to hearken to an accommodation, upon&nbsp;ſuch terras as were conſiſtent with his honour.. But&nbsp;the ambaſſador ſound the ſenators ſteady </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font0">their former reſolution, and determined not to enter into- a treaty with his maſter till he had left Italy, and withdrawn&nbsp;from thence all his forces. This gave the king great&nbsp;uneaſineſs ; for he· had already loſt moſt of his veteran&nbsp;troops and. beſt officers, and was ſenſible that he ſhould&nbsp;loſe the reſt if he ventured another engagement. While&nbsp;he was revolving theſe melancholy thoughts in his&nbsp;mind, ambaſſadors arrivçd at his camp from the Syra-cuſians, Agrigentines, and I√eontines, imploring the aſſiſtance of his arms to drive out the Carthaginians, and&nbsp;put an end to the troubles which threatened their respective ſtates with utter deſtruction. Pyrrhus, who&nbsp;wanted only ſome honourable pretence to leave Italy,&nbsp;laid hold of this ; and appointing Milo governor of Tarentum, with a ſtrong garriſon to keep the inhabitants in&nbsp;awe during his abſence, he ſet ſail ſor Sicily with 30,000&nbsp;foot and 2500 horſe, on board a fleet of 200 ſhips.&nbsp;Here he was at firſt attended with great ſucceſs ; but&nbsp;the Sicilians, diſguſted at the reſolution he had taken&nbsp;of paſſing over into Africa, and much more at the enormous exactions and extortions of his miniſters and courtiers, had ſubmitted partly to the Carthaginians and&nbsp;partly to the Mamertines. When Carthage heard of&nbsp;this change, new troops were raiſed all over Africa, and&nbsp;a numerous army ſent into Sicily to recover the cities&nbsp;which Pyrrhus had taken. As the Sicilians daily deſerted from him in crowds, he was no way in a condition, with his Epirots alone, to withſtand ſo powerful&nbsp;an enemy ; and therefore, when deputies came to him&nbsp;from the Tarentines, Samnites, Bruttians, and Lucanians, repreſenting to him the loſſes they had ſuſtained&nbsp;ſince his departure, and remonſtrating, that, without&nbsp;his aſſiſtance, they muſt fall a ſacriſice to the Romans,&nbsp;he laid hold of that opportunity to abandon the iſland,&nbsp;and return to Italy. His fleet was attacked by that of&nbsp;Carthage ; and his army, after their landing, by the&nbsp;Mamertines. But Pyrrhus having, by his heroic bravery, eſeaped all danger, marched along the ſea-ſhore,&nbsp;in order to reach Tarentum that way. As he paſſed&nbsp;through the country of the Locrians, who had not&nbsp;long before maſſacred the troops he had left there, he&nbsp;not only exerciſed all ſorts of cruelty on the inhabitants, but plundered the temple of Proſerpine to ſupply&nbsp;the wants of his army. The immenſe riches which he&nbsp;found there, were, by his order, ſent to Tarentum by&nbsp;ſea ; but the ſhips that carried them being daſhed againſt the rocks by a tempeſt, and the mariners all loſt,&nbsp;this proud prince was convinced, ſays Livy, that the gods&nbsp;were not imaginary beings, and cauſed all the treaſure,&nbsp;which the ſea had thrown upon the ſhore, to be carefully gathered up, and replaced in the temple : nay, to&nbsp;appeaſe the wrath of the angry goddeſs, he put all&nbsp;thoſe to death who had adviſed him to plunder her temple. However, ſuperſtition made the ancients aſeribe&nbsp;to this act of impiety all the misfortunes, which , after»&nbsp;wards befel that unhappy prince.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pyrrhus at length arrived at Tarentum ; but of the army he had carried into Sicily, he brought back into&nbsp;Italy only 2000 horſe and not· quite 20,000 foot. He&nbsp;therefore reinforced them w<sup>,</sup>ith the beſt troops he could&nbsp;raiſe in the countries of'the Samnites, Lucanians, and&nbsp;Bruttians ; and hearing that the two new conſuls, Cu-rius Dentatus and Cornelius. Lentulus, had divided&nbsp;their forces, the one invading Lucania and the other&nbsp;Samnium, he likewiſe divided his army into two bodies,&nbsp;marching, with the choice of his Epirots againſt Dentatus, in hopes of ſurpriſing him in his camp near Be-neventum. But the conſul having notice, of his approach, went out of his intrenchments with a ſtrong&nbsp;detachment of legionaries to meet him ; repulſed his</span></p>
