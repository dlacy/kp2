. The history of the house of Savoy shows in a striking manner how the destinies of a nation may depend on the fortunes of a princely family. During eight centuries, and through all changes of fortune, the princes of Savoy have kept one end steadily in view, and, in the words of Charles Emmanuel III., have “treated Italy as an artichoke to be eaten leaf by leaf.” The ambitions of princes and the interests of the people have fortunately tended in the same direction, and their work is now perfected in the glory of their house and the freedom of the state.</p><p>The descent of <hi rend="smallcaps">Humbert</hi> the Whitehanded, the founder of the family, is uncertain, but he was most probably a son of Amadeus, the great-grandson of that Boso of Provence (879) who was father of the emperor Louis the Blind. In reward for services rendered to Rudolph III. of Arles, Humbert obtained from him in 1027 the counties of Savoy and Maurienne, and from the emperor Conrad the Salic Chablais and the Lower Valais. His territories, therefore, all lay on the north-western slopes of the Alps. On his death in 1048 he was succeeded perhaps by his eldest son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> I., but eventually by his fourth son <hi rend="smallcaps">Otho</hi>, "who, by his marriage with Adelaide, sole heiress of the marquis of Susa, obtained the counties of Turin and the Val d’Aosta, and so acquired a footing in the valley of the Po. His wife’s rank, too, as marchioness made the family guardians of the frontier by authority of the king of Italy, as they had been before by possession of territory, and was the foundation of their subsequent power as “warders” of the Alps. Otho was succeeded in 1060 by his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> II., who maintained a judicious neutrality between his brother-in-law the emperor Henry IV. and the pope. In reward for his mediation between them he obtained from the former after Canossa the province of Bugey. The accession of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">HumberT</hi> II. in 1080 brought fresh increase of territory in the valley of the Tarantaise, and in 1091 this prince succeeded to the dignities of his grandmother Adelaide, when he assumed the title of prince of Piedmont. <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> III. came to the throne in 1103, and in 1111 his states were created counties of the empire by Henry V. On his way home from the crusades in 1149 Amadeus died at Nicosia, and was succeeded by his son <hi rend="smallcaps">HumberT</hi> III. This prince did not follow the example of Amadeus II., but took the part of the pope against Barbarossa, who accordingly ravaged his territories until Humbert’s death in 1188. The guardians of his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas</hi> acted more discreetly, and reconciled their ward and the emperor. He remained Ghibelline all his life, and received from Henry VI. accessions of territory in Vaud, Bugey, and Valais, with the title of imperial vicar in Piedmont and Lombardy. He was followed in 1233 by <hi rend="smallcaps">Amadeus</hi> IV., whose wife was the beautiful Cecilia of Beaux, surnamed Passe Rose. A campaign against the inhabitants of Valais ended in the annexation of their district, and his support of Frederick II. against the pope caused the erection of Chablais and Aosta into a duchy. In 1253 his son <hi rend="smallcaps">Boniface</hi> succeeded to his states at the age of nine, but, after giving proofs of his valour by defeating the troops of Charles of Anjou before Turin, he was taken prisoner and died of grief (1263).</p><p>The Salic law now came into operation for the first time, and <hi rend="smallcaps">Peter,</hi> the uncle of Boniface, was called to the throne. This prince, on the marriage of his nieces Eleanor and Sancha of Provence with Henry III. of England and Richard, earl of Cornwall, had visited England, where he had been created earl of Richmond, and built a palace in London afterwards called Savoy House. His brothers Boniface and William were also appointed, the former to the see of Canterbury, and the latter to the presidency of the council. In return he recognized the claims of Richard to the impe-<pb facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0360.jp2" xml:id="eb09-21-s01-0340"/>

slopes of the Sahyádris contain large numbers of wild animals, including the tiger, panther, leopard, bear, hyaena, &amp;c. Snakes and other reptiles also abound. The state possesses no railway ; but there is an excellent trunk road through the territory.</p><p>The census of 1881 returned the population of Sáwantwári at 174,433 (males 86,061, females 88,372) ; Hindus numbered 166,080, Mohammedans 3970, and Christians 4213. Agriculture supports the greater part of the population. The staple product is rice, but excepting rice none but the coarsest grains and pulses are raised, both soil, which is stony, and climate being against the cultivation of wheat and other superior grains ; oil seeds, hemp, and pepper are also grown. The gross revenue of the state in 1883-84 amounted to about £34,000. Before the establishment of Portuguese power (1510) Sáwantwári was the highway of a great traffic ; but during the 16th and 17th centuries trade suffered much from the rivalry of the Portuguese, and in the disturbances of the 18th century it almost entirely disappeared. Since the establishment of order under the British (1819), trade has considerably developed. The present chief being a minor, the administration has been in the hands of the British since 1869.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
