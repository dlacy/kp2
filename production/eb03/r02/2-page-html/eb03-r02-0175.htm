<p><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">preſerve her perſon as </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">an </span><span class="font0">ornament to grace his tri* umph. Cleopatra, however, was upon her guard, and&nbsp;wouid not confer with Proculus, except through the&nbsp;gate, which was well ſecured. In the mean time, while&nbsp;he deſignedly drew out the conference to ſome length,&nbsp;and had given Gallus,one of his fellow-ſoldiers, directions&nbsp;to carry on the converſation in his abſence, he entered&nbsp;with two more by the window at which Antony had been&nbsp;drawn up. As ſoon as he was entered, he ran down&nbsp;to the gate ; and one of the women crying out, that&nbsp;they were taken alive, Cleopatra, perceiving what had&nbsp;happened, drew a poniard, and attempted to ftab herſelf ; but Proculus prevented the blow, and gently remonſtrated that ſhe was cruel in refuſing ſo good a prince&nbsp;as his maſter was the pleaſure of diſplaying his clemency. He then forced the poniard out of her hand,&nbsp;and examined her clothes to be certain ſhe had no poiſon&nbsp;about her. Thus leaving every thing ſecured, he went&nbsp;to acquaint his maſter with his proceedings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Octavianus was extremely pleaſed at finding her in his power : he ſent Epaphroditus to bring her to his&nbsp;palace, and to watch her with the utmoſt circumſpec-tion. He was likewiſe ordered to uſe her, in every reſpect, with that deference and ſubmiſſion which were&nbsp;due to her rank, and to do every thing in his power to&nbsp;render her captivity agreeable. She was permitted to&nbsp;have the honour of granting Antony the rites of burial, and furniſhed with every thing ſhe deſired, that&nbsp;was becoming his dignity to receive, or her love to offer. Yet ſtill ſhe languiſhed under her new confinement. Her exceſſive ſorrow, her many loſſes, and the&nbsp;blows ſhe had given her boſom, produced a fever&nbsp;which ſhe ſeemed willing to increaſe. She reſolved to&nbsp;abſtain from taking any nouriſhment, under the pretence&nbsp;of a regimen neceſſary for her diſorder ; but Octavianus being made acquainted with the real motive by&nbsp;her phyſician, began to threaten her with regard to her&nbsp;children, in caſe ſhe perſiſted. This was the only puniſhment that could now affect her ; ſhe allowed herſelf&nbsp;to be treated as they thought proper, and received whatever was preſcribed for her recovery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time Octavianus made his entry into Alexandria ; taking care to mitigate the fears of the&nbsp;inhabitants, by converſing familiarly as he went along&nbsp;with Areus, a philoſopher, and a native of the place.&nbsp;The citizens, however, trembled at his approach ; and&nbsp;when he placed himſelf upon the tribunal, they pro-ſtrated themſelves, with they· faces to the ground, before him, like criminals who waited the ſentence of their&nbsp;execution. Octavianus preſently ordered them to riſe;&nbsp;telling them, that three motives induced him to pardon&nbsp;them : His reſpect for Alexander, who was the founder&nbsp;of their city ; his admiration of its beauty ; and his&nbsp;friendſhip for Areus, their fellow-citizen. Two only of&nbsp;particular note were put to death upon this occaſion ;&nbsp;Antony’s eldeſt ſon Antyllus, and Cæſario, the ſon of&nbsp;Julius Cæſar ; both betrayed into his hands by their respective tutors, who themſelves ſuffered for their perfidy&nbsp;ſhortly after. As for the reſt of Cleopatra’s children,&nbsp;he treated them with great gentleneſs, leaving them to&nbsp;the care of thoſe who were entruſted with their education, who had orders to provide them with every thing&nbsp;ſuitable to their birth. When ſhe was recovered from&nbsp;her late indiſpoſition, he came to viſit her in perſon.—&nbsp;Cleopatra had been preparing for this interview, and</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">made uſe of every method ſhe could think, of to propi-' tiate the conqueror, and to gain his affection ; but in vain. However, at his departure, Octavianus imagined&nbsp;that he had reconciled her to life, and to the indignity&nbsp;of being ſhown in the intended triumph, which he was&nbsp;preparing for on his return to Rome: but in this he was&nbsp;deceived, Cleopatra, all this time, had kept a correſpondence with Dolabella, a young Roman of high&nbsp;birth, in the camp of Octavianus ; who, perhaps, from&nbsp;compaſſion, or ſtronger motives, was intereſted in the&nbsp;misfortunes of that princeſs. From him ſhe learnt the&nbsp;intentions of Octavianus, and that he was determined to&nbsp;ſend her off in three days, together with her children,&nbsp;to Rome. She now therefore determined upon dying;&nbsp;but previouſly intreated permiſſion to pay her oblations&nbsp;at Antony’s tomb. This requeſt being granted her,&nbsp;ſhe was carried with her two female attendants to the&nbsp;ſtately monument where he was laid. There ſhe threw&nbsp;herſelf upon his coffin, bewailed her captivity, and renewed her proteſtations not to ſurvive him. She then&nbsp;crowned the tomb with garlands of flowers ; and having&nbsp;kiſſed the coffin a thouſand times, ſhe returned home to&nbsp;execute her fatal reſolution. Having bathed, and ordered a ſumptuous banquet, ſhe attired herſelf in the&nbsp;moſt ſplendid manner. She then feaſted as uſual ; and&nbsp;ſoon after ordered all but her two attendants, Charmi-on and Iras, to leave the room. Then, having previouſly ordered an aſp to be ſecretly conveyed to her in a&nbsp;bafl&lt;et of fruit, ſhe ſent a letter to Octavianus, informing&nbsp;him of her fatal purpoſe, and deſiring to be buried in&nbsp;the ſame tomb with Antony. Octavianus, upon receiving this letter, inſtantly diſpatched meſſengers to prevent her, but they arrived too late. Upon entering the&nbsp;chamber, they beheld Cleopatra lying dead upon a&nbsp;gilded couch, arrayed in her royal robes. Near her,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Iras, one of her faithful attendants, was ſtretched liſeleſs at the ſeet of her miſtreſs : and Charmion herſelf, almoſt expiring, was ſettling the diadem upon Cleopatra’s&nbsp;head. She died at the age of thirty-nine, after having-reigned twenty-two years. Her death put an end to&nbsp;the monarchy in Egypt, which had flouriſhed there from&nbsp;time immemorial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Octavianus ſeemed much troubled at Cleopatra’s death, as it deprived him of a principal ornament in&nbsp;his intended triumph. However, the manner of it a&nbsp;good deal exalted her character among the Romans,&nbsp;with whom ſuicide was conſidered as a virtue. Her&nbsp;dying requeſt was complied with, her body being laid&nbsp;by Antony’s, and a magnificent funeral prepared for&nbsp;her and her two faithful attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After having ſettled the affairs of Egypt, he leſt Alexandria in the beginning of September, in the&nbsp;year of Rome 720, with a deſign to return through&nbsp;Syria, Aſia Minor, and Greece, to Italy. On his arrival at Antioch, he found there Tiridates, who had&nbsp;been raiſed to the throne of Parthia in oppoſition to&nbsp;Phrahates, and likewiſe ambaſſadors from Phrahates,&nbsp;who were all come on the ſame errand ; to wit, to ſolicit the aſſiſtance of the Romans againſt each other.&nbsp;Octavianus gave a friendly anſwer both to Tiridates and&nbsp;the ambaſſadors of Phrahates, without intending to help&nbsp;either ; but rather with a deſign to animate the one&nbsp;againſt the other, and by that means to weaken both,&nbsp;ſo far as to render the Parthian name no longer formidable to Rome. After this, having appointed Meſſala</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
