a province of Turkey in Europe, bounded on the north by the rivers Danube and Save, which ſeparate it from Hungary ; on the eaſt, by Bulgaria ; on the west, by Boſnia ; and on the ſouth, by Albania and Macedonia. It is about 190 miles in length from eaſt to west ; 95 in breadth from north to ſouth ; and is divided into four ſangiacates. Two of theſe were ceded to the Chriſtians in 1718, who united them into one. This continued till 1739, when the Turks were victorious ; and then they were abandoned to the Turks by the treaty of Belgrade. Belgrade is the capital town.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
