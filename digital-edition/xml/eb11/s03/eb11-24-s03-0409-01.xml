Either from a custom of keeping each series of twenty numbers or notches on a separate tally, or of marking the twentieth number by a longer or deeper mark, the word was early used to denote the number twenty; it is still used as a measure of weight, equivalent to 20 lb, computing the weight of animals sold for slaughtering for food. In music, a score is the written or printed copy of a composition on two or more staves, barred and braced together. For instrumental and vocal music a “ full score ” has the parts for each class of voice and instrument on a separate staff.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
