<p><span class="font0">past of which they had known but little, described in poetical and ornate phraseology, a new impulse was given&nbsp;to the collection of all the remains of popular literature.&nbsp;In 1804 appeared a volume based upon those which had&nbsp;been gathered together by Cyril or Kirsha Daniloff, a Cossack, at the beginning of the 18th century. They were&nbsp;received with much enthusiasm, and a second edition was&nbsp;published in 1818. In the following year there appeared&nbsp;at Leipsic a translation of many of these pieces into German, in consequence of which they became known much&nbsp;more widely. This little book of 160 pages is important in&nbsp;many ways, and not the least so because the originals of&nbsp;some of the bilini translated in it are now lost. Since&nbsp;that time large collections of these poems have been&nbsp;published, edited by Ribnikoff, Hilferding, Sreznevski,&nbsp;Avenarius, and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These curious productions have all the characteristics of popular poetry in the endless repetitions of certain conventional phrases—the “ green wine,” “ the bright sun ”&nbsp;(applied to a hero), “ the damp earth,” and others. The&nbsp;heroes of the first cycle are monstrous beings, and seem to&nbsp;be merely impersonifications of the powers of nature ;&nbsp;such are Volga Vseslavich, Mikula Selianinovich, and Svia-togor. They are called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bogatîri starshie.</span><span class="font0"> Sometimes&nbsp;we have the giants of the mountain, as Sviatogor, and&nbsp;the serpent Gorinich, the root of part of both names being&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gora</span><span class="font0"> (mountain). The serpent Gorinich lives in caves,&nbsp;and has the care of the precious metals. Sometimes animal&nbsp;natures are mixed up with them, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zmei-bogαtkr,</span><span class="font0"> who&nbsp;unites the qualities of the serpent and the giant, and bears&nbsp;the name of Tugarin Zmievich. There is the Pagan Idol&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Idolistche Poganskoe),</span><span class="font0"> a great glutton, and Nightingale&nbsp;the Robber </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Solovei RazboiniU),</span><span class="font0"> who terrifies travellers and&nbsp;lives in a nest built upon six oaks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the second cycle the legends group themselves round the celebrated prince Vladimir of Kieff, in whose time the&nbsp;Christian religion was introduced into Russia, as previously&nbsp;mentioned. The chief hero is Ilya Murometz, who&nbsp;performs prodigies of valour, and is of gigantic stature and&nbsp;superhuman strength. The cycle of Novgorod deals with&nbsp;the stories of Vasilii Buslaevich and Sadko, the rich&nbsp;merchant. The great commercial prosperity of Novgorod&nbsp;has been already described. The fourth cycle deals with&nbsp;the autocracy ; already Moscow has become the capital of&nbsp;the future empire. AVe are told of the taking of Kazan,&nbsp;of the conquest of Siberia by Yermak, of Ivan the Terrible&nbsp;and his confidant Maliuta Skuvlatovich. It is observable&nbsp;that in the popular tradition Ivan, in spite of his cruelties,&nbsp;is not spoken of with any hatred. As early as 1619 some of&nbsp;these bilini were committed to writing by Richard James,&nbsp;an Oxford graduate who was in Russia about that time as&nbsp;chaplain of the embassy. The most pathetic of these is&nbsp;that relating to the unfortunate Xenia, the daughter of&nbsp;Boris Godunoff. Yermak, the conqueror of Siberia, forms&nbsp;the subject of a very spirited lay, and there is another on&nbsp;the death of Ivan the Terrible. Considering the relation&nbsp;in which she stood to the Russians, we cannot wonder that&nbsp;Marina, the wife of the false Demetrius, appears as a&nbsp;magician. Many spirited poems are consecrated to the&nbsp;achievements of Stenka Razia, the bold robber of the&nbsp;Volga, who was a long time a popular hero. The cycle of&nbsp;Peter the Great is a very interesting one. AVe have songs&nbsp;in abundance on the various achievements of the wonderful&nbsp;czar, as the taking of Azoff in 1696. There is also a poem&nbsp;on the execution of the streltzi, and another on the death of&nbsp;Peter. In the more modern period there are many songs&nbsp;on Napoleon. The Cossack songs, written in the Little&nbsp;Russian language, dwell upon the glories of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sech,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;sufferings of the people from the invasions of the Turks&nbsp;and Mongols, the exploits of the Haidamaks and lastly the&nbsp;fall of the Cossack republic. Besides these, the Russians&nbsp;can boast of large collections of religious poems, many of&nbsp;them containing very curious legends. In them we have&nbsp;a complete store of the beliefs of the Middle Ages. A rich&nbsp;field may be found here for the study of comparative&nbsp;mythology and folk-lore. Many of them are of considerable&nbsp;antiquity, and some seem to have been derived from the&nbsp;Midrash. Some of the more important of these have been&nbsp;collected by Beszonoff. Besides the bilini or legendary&nbsp;poems, the Russians have large collections of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">skazki</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;folk-tales, which have been gathered together by Sakharoff,&nbsp;Afanasieff, and others. They also are full of valuable&nbsp;materials for the study of comparative mythology.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Leaving the popular and oral literature, we come to what has been committed to writing. The earliest&nbsp;specimen of Russian, properly so-called, must be considered&nbsp;the Ostromir Codex, written by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">diak</span><span class="font0"> Gregory at&nbsp;the order of Ostromir, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">posadnik</span><span class="font0"> or governor of&nbsp;Novgorod. This is a Russian recension of the Slavonic&nbsp;Gospels, of the date 1056-57. Of the year 1073 we have&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Izbomik</span><span class="font0"> or “ Miscellany ” of Sviatoslaff. It was&nbsp;written by John the diak or deacon for that prince, and is&nbsp;a kind of Russian encyclopædia, drawn from Greek sources.&nbsp;The date is 1076. The style is praised by Buslaeff as&nbsp;clear and simple. The next monument of the language is&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Discourse concerning the Old and New Testament</span><span class="font0"> by&nbsp;Ilarion, metropolitan of Kieff. In this work there is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">panegyric on Prince Vladimir of Kieff, the hero of so much&nbsp;of the Russian popular poetry. Other writers are Theodosius, a monk of the Pestcherski cloister, who wrote on the&nbsp;Latin faith and some </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pouchenia</span><span class="font0"> or “ Instructions,” and&nbsp;Luke Zhidiata, bishop of Novgorod, who has left us a&nbsp;curious </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Discourse to the Brethren.</span><span class="font0"> From the writings of&nbsp;Theodosius we see that many pagan habits were still in&nbsp;vogue among the people. He finds fault with them for&nbsp;allowing these to continue, and also for their drunkenness ;&nbsp;nor do the monks escape his censures. Zhidiata writes in&nbsp;a more vernacular style than many of his contemporaries ;&nbsp;he eschews the declamatory tone of the Byzantine authors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">AVith the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font0"> of Nestor </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> begins the long series of the Russian annalists. There is a regular&nbsp;catena of these chronicles, extending with only two breaks&nbsp;to the time of Alexis Mikhailovich, the father of Peter the&nbsp;Great. Besides the work attributed to Nestor, we have&nbsp;chronicles of Novgorod, Kieff, Volhynia, and many others.&nbsp;Every town of any importance could boast of its annalists,&nbsp;Pskoff and Suzdal among others. In some respects these&nbsp;compilations, the productions of monks in their cloisters,&nbsp;remind us of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,</span><span class="font0"> dry details&nbsp;alternating with here and there a picturesque incident ;&nbsp;but the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anglo-Saxon Chronicle</span><span class="font0"> has nothing of the saga&nbsp;about it, and many of these annals abound with the&nbsp;quaintest stories. There are also works of early travellers,&nbsp;as the igumen Daniel, who visited the Holy Land at the&nbsp;end of the 11th and beginning of the 12th century. A&nbsp;later traveller was Athanasius Nikitin, a merchant of Tver,&nbsp;who visited India in 1470. He has left a record of his&nbsp;adventures, which has been translated into English and&nbsp;published for the Hakluyt Society. Later also is the&nbsp;account written by the two merchants, Korobeinikoff and&nbsp;Grekoff. They were sent with a sum of money to the&nbsp;Holy Sepulchre to entreat the monks to pray without&nbsp;ceasing for the soul of the son of Ivan the Terrible, whom&nbsp;his father had killed. A curious monument of old Slavonic&nbsp;times is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pouchenie</span><span class="font0"> (“Instruction”) written by VIadimir&nbsp;Monomakh for the benefit of his sons. This composition&nbsp;is generally found inserted in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle</span><span class="font0"> of Nestor ; it&nbsp;gives a quaint picture of the daily life of a Slavonic prince.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the 12th century we have the sermons of Cyril, the bishop of Turoff, which are attempts to imitate in Russian</span></p>
