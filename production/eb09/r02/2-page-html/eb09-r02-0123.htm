<p><span class="font1">The so-called papal rings, of which many exist dating from the 15th to the 17th centuries, appear to have&nbsp;been given by the popes to new-made cardinals. They&nbsp;are very large thumb rings, usually of gilt bronze coarsely&nbsp;worked, and set with a foiled piece of glass or crystal.&nbsp;On the hoop is usually engraved the name and arms of&nbsp;the reigning pope, the bezel being without a device.&nbsp;They are of little intrinsic value, but magnificent in&nbsp;appearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another very large and elaborate form of ring is that used during the Jewish marriage service. Fine examples&nbsp;of the 16 th and 17 th centuries exist. In the place of the&nbsp;bezel is a model, minutely worked in gold or base metal,&nbsp;of a building with high gabled roofs, and frequently&nbsp;movable weathercocks on the apex. This is a conventional representation of the temple at Jerusalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps the most magnificent rings from the beauty of the workmanship of the hoop are those of which Benvenuto&nbsp;Cellini produced the finest examples. They are of gold,&nbsp;richly chased and modelled with caryatides or grotesque&nbsp;figures, and are decorated with coloured enamels in a very&nbsp;skilful and elaborate way. Very fine jewels are sometimes&nbsp;set in these magnificent pieces of 16th-century jewellery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thumb rings were commonly worn from the 14th to the 17th century. Falstaff boasts that in his youth he was&nbsp;slender enough to “ creep into any alderman’s thumb&nbsp;ring” (Shakes., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hen. IV., Pi. I.,</span><span class="font1"> act ii. sc. 4).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The finest collections of rings formed in Britain have been those of Lord Londesborough, Edmund Waterton&nbsp;(now in the South Kensington Museum), and those still in&nbsp;the possession of Mr A. W. Franks and Mr Drury&nbsp;Fortnum.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RIOBAMBA, or Royabamba, a town in the South-American republic of Ecuador, situated on the road from Guayaquil to Quito in “a sand valley or plain of the&nbsp;great central highland of the Andes—Chimborazo, Car-guairazo, Tunguragua, and Altar all being visible from its&nbsp;plaza.” The town has occupied its present site only since&nbsp;the close of the 18th century; in 1797 the old town, which&nbsp;lay about 12 miles to the west at Cajabamba, was completely destroyed by a vast landslip (still recognizable)&nbsp;from Mount Cicalfa in one of the most terrific convulsions&nbsp;recorded even in that region of volcanic activity. Ruins&nbsp;still remain to show that Riobamba was a much larger&nbsp;and finer place then than at the present day. Though&nbsp;said to have 16,000 inhabitants, and to manufacture&nbsp;woollen gloves, sacking, and coverlets, the town is poorly&nbsp;built and comparatively lifeless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIO DE JANEIRO (in full form SÀo Sebastiäo do Rio de Janeiro, and colloquially shortened to Rio), the&nbsp;capital of Brazil, and one of the principal seaports of&nbsp;South America, is situated on the western side of one of&nbsp;the finest natural harbours in the world in 25° 54' 23&quot;&nbsp;S. lat. and 43° 8' 34'' W. long, (the position of the&nbsp;observatory). Along with its environs it is separated&nbsp;from the province of Rio de Janeiro (whose chief town is&nbsp;Nitherohi) and constitutes an independent municipality&nbsp;(municipio neutro), with an area of about 540 square&nbsp;miles, divided into nineteen (formerly sixteen) parishes or&nbsp;frequezias. Most of the streets are narrow and meanlooking ; even the fashionable Rua do Ouvidor, which is&nbsp;lined on both sides with handsome shops, is a mere alley.&nbsp;The Rua Direita, or, as it is now called officially, Rua&nbsp;Primeiro de Março, is the principal business street, and is&nbsp;wide and pleasant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It runs from the gate of the royal&nbsp;palace (a building&nbsp;of small pretensions) to the convent of Sào Bento,&nbsp;and contains the&nbsp;exchange, the post&nbsp;office, and the&nbsp;custom-house, as&nbsp;well as the imperial chapel (1761)&nbsp;and several other&nbsp;churches. The&nbsp;churches and monastic buildings of&nbsp;Rio de Janeiro&nbsp;number upwards of&nbsp;fifty, mostly built&nbsp;in the “Jesuit”&nbsp;style, but striking from their size and the barbaric magnificence of their decorations, as well as on account of&nbsp;their well-chosen sites. La Candellaria (17th century) is&nbsp;conspicuous from the height of its towers, and La Gloria&nbsp;crowns a beautiful eminence on the bay. The monastery&nbsp;of Sào Bento is reputed to be the wealthiest in the empire,&nbsp;with large possessions in land and mines ; and its chapel&nbsp;is not unworthy of that reputation. Besides the famous&nbsp;hospital of Dorn Pedro IL, better known as La Miseri-cordia, because built (1841) on ground belonging to the&nbsp;fraternity of that name, there are several smaller institutions of the same class in the city ; and a large and handsome lunatic asylum, founded in 1841 with funds obtained&nbsp;by selling titles of nobility at a fixed tariff, occupies a good&nbsp;position in the Botafogo suburb. The military hospital is&nbsp;also an extensive establishment. Among the literary and&nbsp;scientific institutions of the city, the College Dorn Pedro</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
