The terrible massacre perpetrated by the Egyptians was in revenge for the treacherous assassination by the native chiefs at Shendy of Ismail Pasha and his suite, who were first drugged and then burned to ashes with their huts. Shendy was the capital of a considerable district, and lies only 20 miles south of the ruins of Meroe.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
