<p><span class="font1">time. The real officers of the legion were the 60 centurions, men who (at least in the early Empire) generally served up from the&nbsp;ranks, and who knew their work. The senior centurion, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primus pilus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was an especially important officer, and on retirement frequently&nbsp;became </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praefectus castrorum,</span><span class="font1"> “camp adjutant,” or obtained other&nbsp;promotion. Below the centurions were under-officers, standard-bearers, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Optiones,</span><span class="font1"> clerks and the like. The men themselves were&nbsp;recruited from the body of Roman citizens (though we may believe&nbsp;that birth-certificates were not always demanded). During the&nbsp;ist century Italy, and particularly north Italy, provided the bulk&nbsp;of the recruits. After a.d. 70, recruiting in Italy for the legions&nbsp;practically ceased and men were drawn from the Romanized towns&nbsp;of the provinces. After Hadrian, each province seems to have&nbsp;supplied most </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">the men for the legion (if any) stationed in it, and&nbsp;so many sons of soldiers born during service </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(castrenses)</span><span class="font1"> flocked to the&nbsp;army that a military caste almost grew up. The term of service was,&nbsp;in full, twenty years, at least in theory, but recruiting was voluntary&nbsp;and when men were short discharges were often withheld. On&nbsp;discharge the ex-legionary received a bounty or land: many&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coloniae</span><span class="font1"> (municipalities) were established in the provinces by certain&nbsp;emperors for the special purpose </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">taking discharged veterans—&nbsp;according to a custom of which the first instances occur in the latest&nbsp;Republican age.. On the whole, the legionary was still the typical&nbsp;“ Roman ” soldier. If he was no longer Italian, he was generally&nbsp;of citizen, birth and always of citizen rank, and his connexion with&nbsp;the Empire and the government was real. Each legion bore a&nbsp;title and a number </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> II. Augusta, III. Galliea). The custom of&nbsp;using such titles and numbers can be detected sporadically in the&nbsp;latest Republic, and many titles and numbers then borne by legions&nbsp;passed on into the Empire with the legions themselves. As Augustus&nbsp;gradually became master of the world, he found himself with three&nbsp;armies, his own and those of Lepidus and Antony; from the three&nbsp;he chose certain legions to form his new standing army., and he left&nbsp;these with the titles and numbers which they had previously borne,&nbsp;although that concession resulted in three legions numbered III.&nbsp;and two numbered IV., V., VI. and X. respectively. Sinjilar titles&nbsp;and numbers were given to legions raised afterwards either to&nbsp;fill up gaps caused by disaster or to increase the army. Here, as&nbsp;elsewhere in the Roman and above all in the Augustan system,&nbsp;precedent defied logic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(B) Besides the legions Augustus developed a new order of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auxilia.</span><span class="font1"> Auxiliaries (as is said above) had served occasionally in&nbsp;the Republican armies since about 250 b.c., and in the latest Republic large bodies of them had been enlisted in the armies of contending generals. Thus Caesar in Gaul enrolled a division of native&nbsp;Gauls, free men but not citizens of Rome, which ranked from the&nbsp;first in all but legal status as a legion, the “Alaudae,” and in due&nbsp;course was formally admitted to the legionary list (legio V.). But this&nbsp;use of non-citizens had been limited in extent and confined in normal&nbsp;circumstances to special troops such as slingers or bowmen. This&nbsp;casual practice Augustus reduced, or rather extended, to system,&nbsp;following in many details the scheme of the Republican </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">socii</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;veiling the novelty under old titles. Henceforward, regiments of&nbsp;infantry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cohortes)</span><span class="font1"> or cavalry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(alae),</span><span class="font1"> 500 or 1000 strong, were regularly&nbsp;raised (apparently, by voluntary recruiting) from the non-citizen&nbsp;populations of the provinces and formed </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">force almost equal in&nbsp;numbers (and perhaps ultimately much more than equal) to the&nbsp;legions. The men who served in these units were less well paid and&nbsp;-served longer than the legionaries; on their discharge they received&nbsp;a bounty and the Roman franchise for themselves and wife and&nbsp;children. They were commanded by Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praefecti</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tribuni,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and were no doubt required to understand Roman orders; they&nbsp;must have generally become Romanized and fit for the citizenship,&nbsp;but they were occasionally (at least in the 1 st century a.d.) permitted&nbsp;to retain tribal weapons and methods of fighting and to serve under&nbsp;the command of tribal leaders, who were at once their chiefs and&nbsp;Roman officers. These auxiliaries provided both the whole of the&nbsp;archers, &amp;e., and nearly the whole of the cavalry of the army;&nbsp;they also included many foot regiments. A peculiar arrangement&nbsp;(to which no exact parallel seems to occur in any other army) was&nbsp;that a cohort of 500 men might include 380 foot and 120 horse and&nbsp;a cohort of 1000 men or 760 foot and 240 horse </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cohors equitata),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ala</span><span class="font1"> might similarly include a proportion of foot </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ala peditata).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Each regiment bore a number and a title, the latter often derived&nbsp;from the officer who had raised the corps </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(ala Indiana,</span><span class="font1"> raised by one&nbsp;Julius Indus) or, still more often, from the tribe which supplied&nbsp;the first recruits </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cohors VII. Gallorum, cohors II. Hispanorum</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the like). To what extent recruiting remained territorial is uncertain :&nbsp;after the ist century, probably, the territorial names meant in most&nbsp;cases very little. The total number of the auxiliary regiments&nbsp;probably varied from time to time and can at present hardly be&nbsp;guessed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Composition of Armies and Distribution of Troops in the Third Stage.—</span><span class="font1">If the system of legions and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auxilia</span><span class="font1"> in the early Empire&nbsp;was novel, the use made of them was no less so. The latest&nbsp;Republic offers to the student the spectacle of large field armies,&nbsp;and though it also reveals a counter tendency to assign special&nbsp;legions to special provinces, that tendency is very feeble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Augustus ended the era of large field armies: he could, indeed, leave no such weapons for future pretenders to the throne. By&nbsp;keeping the Empire within set frontiers, he developed the counter&nbsp;tendency. That policy exactly suited the military position in his&nbsp;time. The early Roman Empire had not to face—as Britain or&nbsp;France or Germany might have to face to-day—the danger of a war&nbsp;with an equal enemy, needing the mobilization of all its national&nbsp;forces. From Augustus till A.D.250 Rome had no conterminous&nbsp;foe from whom to fear invasion. Parthia, her one and dangerous&nbsp;equal, was far away in the East and little able to strike home.&nbsp;Elsewhere, her frontiers bordered more or less wild barbarians,&nbsp;who might often harass, but could not do serious harm. To&nbsp;meet this there was need, not of a strong army concentrated in&nbsp;one or two cantonments, but of many small garrisons scattered&nbsp;along each frontier, with a few stronger fortresses to act as&nbsp;military centres adjacent to these garrisons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Accordingly, a system grew up under Augustus and his immediate successors whereby the whole army was distributed along the frontiers or in specially disorderly districts (such as&nbsp;N .W. Spain) in permanent garrisons. On the actual frontiers&nbsp;and on the chief roads leading to them were numerous cohorts&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">alae</span><span class="font1"> of auxiliaries, garrisoning each its own </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Castellum</span><span class="font1"> of 3-7&nbsp;acres in extent. Close behind the frontiers, or even on them,&nbsp;were the twenty-five legions, each (with a few exceptions of early&nbsp;date) holding its own fortress </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(castra stativa</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hiberna)</span><span class="font1"> of 50-60&nbsp;acres. Details varied at different times. Sometimes, where no&nbsp;RhineorDanubehelpedjandwhcrc outside enemies were many,&nbsp;the frontier was further fortified by a continuous wall of wooden&nbsp;palisades (as in part of Germany, see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Limes)</span><span class="font1"> or of earth or stone&nbsp;(as in Britain, see article </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Britain, Roman),</span><span class="font1"> or the boundary&nbsp;might be guarded by a road patrolled from forts planted along it&nbsp;(as in part of Roman Africa). The result was a long frontier&nbsp;guard covering Britain, and Europe from the German Ocean&nbsp;to the Black Sea, and the upper Euphrates valley, and the edge&nbsp;of the Sahara south of Tunis and Algeria and Morocco, while&nbsp;the wide Empire behind it was little troubled by the presence&nbsp;of soldiers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The following table shows the disposition of the legions about </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 120 and for many decades subsequently. It would be impossible, even if space allowed, to add the auxiliaries, since the&nbsp;details of their distribution are too little known. But it may&nbsp;be in general assumed that the total number of auxiliaries in&nbsp;any province was little less, and probably rather greater, than&nbsp;the number of legionaries, and the sizes of the various provincial&nbsp;armies can thus be calculated roughly. Thus Britain tvas held&nbsp;probably by 35,000-40,000 men. ^Each provincial army was&nbsp;commanded either by the governor of the province or (in a&nbsp;few exceptional cases) by the senior </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legatus</span><span class="font1"> of the legions&nbsp;stationed there:—<sub>Λ</sub></span></p>
