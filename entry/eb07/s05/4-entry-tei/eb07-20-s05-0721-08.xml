an epithet by which genuine English money is distinguished. It is unnecessary to mention the various conjectures of antiquaries about the origin and meaning of this appellation. The most probable opinion seems to be this, that some artists from Germany, who were called <hi rend="italic">Esterlings,</hi> from the situation of their country, had been employed in fabricating our money, which consisted chiefly of silver pennies ; and that from them the penny was called an <hi rend="italic">esterling,</hi> and our money <hi rend="italic">esterling</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sterling</hi> money.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stern</hi>, the posterior part of a ship. The stern is terminated above by the taffarel, and below by the counters ; it is limited on the sides by the quarter-pieces, and the intermediate space comprehends the galleries and windows of the different cabins.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Stern-East,</hi> a rope used to confine the stern of a ship or boat to any wharf or jetty head, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Stern</hi> <hi rend="italic">-Most,</hi> in sea language, usually denotes that part of a fleet of ships which is in the rear, or farthest a-stern, as opposed to headmost.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Stern-</hi> <hi rend="italic">Post,</hi> a long straight piece of timber erected on the extremity of the keel, to sustain the rudder and terminate the ship behind.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Stern-</hi> <hi rend="italic">Sheets,</hi> that part of a boat which is contained between the stern and the aftmost or hindmost seat of the rowers.
