<p><span class="font0">present article attention will be specially confined to the case of the higher vertebrates, and in particular to man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Air is brought into the lungs by the movements of breathing (see above, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Movements of Respiration).</span><span class="font0"> Oxygen from this&nbsp;air passes through the delicate lining membrane of the air-celIs&nbsp;of the lungs into the blood, where it enters into loose chemical&nbsp;combination with the haemoglobin of the red corpuscles (see&nbsp;Blood). In this form it is conveyed onwards to the heart, and&nbsp;thence through the arteries to the capillaries, where it again&nbsp;parts from the haemoglobin, and passes through the capillary&nbsp;walls to the tissues, where it is consumed. Carbon dioxide&nbsp;passes out from the tissues into the blood in a corresponding&nbsp;manner, enters into loose combination as bicarbonate, and&nbsp;possibly in other ways, in the blood, and is conveyed by the&nbsp;veins to the lungs, whence it passes out in the expired air.&nbsp;Pure atmospheric air contains 20-93% of oxygen, -03% of&nbsp;carbon dioxide and 79-04% of nitrogen (with which is mixed&nbsp;about 0.9% of argon). The dried expired air in man contains&nbsp;about 3-5% of carbon dioxide and 17% of oxygen, so that&nbsp;roughly speaking the carbon dioxide is increased by about&nbsp;3-5% and the oxygen diminished by 4%. Expired air as it&nbsp;leaves the body contains about 6% of moisture, compared with&nbsp;usually about 1 % in the inspired air. The added moisture and&nbsp;higher temperature of expired air make it decidedly lighter than&nbsp;pure air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Owing to the unpleasant effects often produced in badly ventilated rooms it was for Iong supposed that some poisonous&nbsp;volatile “ organic matter ” is also given off in the breath. Careful&nbsp;investigation has shown that this is not the case. The unpleasant effects are partly due to heat and moisture, and partly&nbsp;to odours which are usually not of respiratory origin. The&nbsp;carbon dioxide present in the air of even very badly ventilated&nbsp;rooms is present in far too small proportions to have any&nbsp;sensible effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The average volume of air inspired per minute by healthy adult men during rest is about 7 litres or *25 cub. ft. In&nbsp;different individuals the frequency of breathing varies considerably—from about 7 to 25 per minute, the depth of each&nbsp;breath varying about inversely as the frequency. During muscular work the volume of air breathed may be six or eight times&nbsp;as much as during rest. The volume of carbon dioxide given&nbsp;off varies from about half a cubic foot per hour during complete&nbsp;rest to 5 cub. ft. during severe exertion, but averages about&nbsp;0*9 cub. ft. per hour, and will reach or exceed 1 cub. ft. per&nbsp;hour during even very light exertion. The voIume of oxygen&nbsp;consumed is about a seventh greater than that of the carbon&nbsp;dioxide given off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The breathing is regulated from a nervous centre situated in the medulla oblongata, which is the lowest part of the brain.&nbsp;If this centre is destroyed or injured the breathing stops and&nbsp;death rapidly results. From the respiratory centre rhythmic&nbsp;efferent impulses proceed down the motor nerves supplying&nbsp;the diaphragm, intercostals and other respiratory muscles.&nbsp;Afferent impulses through various nerves may temporarily&nbsp;affect the rhythm of the respiratory centre. Of these afferent&nbsp;impulses by far the most important are those which proceed up&nbsp;the vagus nerve from the lungs themselves. On distention of&nbsp;the lungs with air the inspiratory impulses from the respiratory&nbsp;centre are suddenly arrested or “ inhibited ”; on the Otherhand,&nbsp;collapse of the lung strongly excites to inspiratory effort. On&nbsp;section of the vagus nerve these effects disappear, and the&nbsp;breathing becomes less frequent and much more laboured.&nbsp;The vagus nerve is thus the carrier of both inhibitory and&nbsp;exciting stimuli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the physiological function of breathing is to bring oxygen to and remove carbon dioxide from the blood, it would naturally&nbsp;be expected that breathing would be regulated in accordance&nbsp;with the amount of oxygen required and of carbon dioxide&nbsp;formed; but until quite recently the actual mode of regulation&nbsp;was by no means clear. It was commonly .supposed that&nbsp;afferent nervous impulses in some way regulated the otherwise&nbsp;automatic action of the centre, want of oxygen or excess of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">CO<sub>2</sub> in the blood being only an occasional and relatively unimportant factor in the regulations. The phenomenon of “apnoea” or complete cessation of natural breathing which occurs after&nbsp;forced breathing, was attributed mainIy to the already&nbsp;mentioned distension effect through the vagus nerves. To go&nbsp;further back still, it was even supposed that the rate and depth of&nbsp;breathing, and the percentage of oxygen in the inspired air,&nbsp;determine the consumption of oxygen and formation of carbon&nbsp;dioxide in the body, just as the air-supply to a fire determines&nbsp;the rate of its combustion. This oId belief is still often met&nbsp;with—for instance, in the reasons given for recommending&nbsp;“ breathing exercises ” as a part of physical training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is evident that if the breathing did not increase correspondingly with the greatly increased consumption of oxygen and formation of CO<sub>2</sub> which occurs, for instance during muscular&nbsp;work, the percentage of oxygen in the air contained in the lung&nbsp;cells or alveoli (alveolar air) would rapidIy fall, and the percentage of carbon dioxide increase. The inevitable result&nbsp;would be a very imperfect aeration of the blood. Investigation&nbsp;of the alevolar air has furnished the key to the actual regulation&nbsp;of breathing. Samples of this air can be obtained by making&nbsp;a sudden and deep expiration through a piece of long tube, and&nbsp;at once collecting some of the air contained in the part of this&nbsp;tube nearest the mouth. By this means it has been found that&nbsp;dining normal breathing at ordinary atmospheric pressure the&nbsp;percentage of carbon dioxide (about 5-6% on an average for&nbsp;men) is constant for each individual, though different persons&nbsp;vary slightly as regards their normal percentage. The breathing&nbsp;is thus so regulated as to keep the percentage of carbon dioxide&nbsp;constant; and under normal conditions this regulation is&nbsp;surprisingly exact. The ordinary expired air is a mixture of&nbsp;aIveolar air and air from the “ dead space ” in the air passages.&nbsp;The deeper the breathing happens to bc, the more alveoIar air&nbsp;there will be in the expired air, and the higher, therefore, the&nbsp;percentage of carbon dioxide in it, so that the expired air is&nbsp;not constant in composition, though the alveolar air is. If air&nbsp;containing 2 or 3 % of carbon dioxide is breathed, the breathing&nbsp;at once becomes deeper, in such a way as to prevent anything&nbsp;but a very slight rise in the alveolar carbon dioxide percentage.&nbsp;The difference is scarcely appreciable subjectively, except during&nbsp;muscular exertion. The effect of 1% of carbon dioxide in the&nbsp;inspired air is so slight as to be negligible, and there is no foundation for the popular belief that even very small percentages of&nbsp;carbon dioxide are injurious. With 4 or 5 % or more of carbon&nbsp;dioxide, however, much panting is produced, and the alveolar&nbsp;carbon dioxide percentage begins to rise appreciably, since&nbsp;compensation is no longer possible. As a consequence, headache&nbsp;and other symptoms are produced. If, on the other hand, the&nbsp;percentage of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air is abnormally&nbsp;reduced by forced breathing, the condition of apnoea is produced&nbsp;and lasts until the percentage again rises to normal, but no longer.&nbsp;Forced breathing with air containing more than about 4% of&nbsp;carbon dioxide causes no apnoea, as the alveolar carbon dioxide&nbsp;does not fall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If oxygen is breathed instead of air there is no appreciable change in the percentage of carbon dioxide in the alveolar air,&nbsp;and no tendency towards apnoea. Want of oxygen is thus&nbsp;not a factor in the regulation of normal breathing. During&nbsp;muscular work the depth and frequency of breathing increase in&nbsp;such a way as to prevent the alveolar carbon dioxide from rising&nbsp;more than very slightly. It is still the carbon dioxide stimulus&nbsp;that regulates the breathing, although with excessive muscular&nbsp;work other accessory factors may come in to some extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under increased barometric pressure the percentage 'of carbon dioxide in <sub>x</sub>the aIveolar air no longer remains constant;&nbsp;it diminishes in proportion to the increase of pressure. For&nbsp;instance, at a ‘pressure of 2 atmospheres it is reduced to&nbsp;half, and at 6 atmospheres to a sixth; while at less than&nbsp;normal atmospheric pressure it rises correspondingly unless&nbsp;symptoms of want of oxygen begin to interfere with this rise.&nbsp;These results show that it is not the mere percentage, but&nbsp;the pressure (or “ partiaI pressure ”) of carbon dioxide in the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
