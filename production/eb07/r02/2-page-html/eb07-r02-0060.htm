On the 19th of May 1759&nbsp;he was promoted to the rank of rear-admiral, and was immediately appointed to the command of a small squadron&nbsp;destined to bombard Havre de Grace. This service he&nbsp;performed in a very effectual manner ; and having continued to keep the sea till the close of the ensuing year, he returned to Britain. In 1761 he was elected member of&nbsp;parliament for Penryn. On the 6th of October he hoisted&nbsp;his flag on board the Marlborough, having been appointed&nbsp;commander-in-chief at Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands,&nbsp;and to conduct the naval operations of the armament destined for the attack of Martinique. This island, together&nbsp;with St Lucia, was speedily reduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The admiral returned home on the 12th of August 1763. On the 21st of the preceding October he had been made&nbsp;vice-admiral of the blue. In 1764 he was created a baronet, and during the following year was appointed governor of Greenwich Hospital. In 1768 he was returned to&nbsp;parliament for Northampton. On the 18th of October&nbsp;1770 he became vice-admiral of the white, and on the 24th&nbsp;of October 1771 vice-admiral of the red. During the latter year, on the 23d of January, he had been appointed&nbsp;commander-in-chief at Jamaica, and with this command&nbsp;was not permitted to retain the office of governor. Having&nbsp;returned to Britain, he struck his flag at Portsmouth on the&nbsp;4th of September 1774.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Being inattentive, as many seamen are, to the rules of economy, his circumstances became so embarrassed that he&nbsp;was obliged to fly from his country, with very slight hopes&nbsp;of ever being able to return. He was in France when the&nbsp;ill-advised policy of that court prompted them to take a&nbsp;decided part with America against Great Britain ; and it is&nbsp;said that some men in power, no strangers to the desperate&nbsp;state of Sir George’s affairs, offered him a high command&nbsp;in the French navy, if he would carry arms against his own&nbsp;country. This offer he rejected with becoming indignation. Soon after this gallant behaviour, the duke de Chartres, afterwards the infamous Orleans, told Sir George that&nbsp;he was himself to have a command in the fleet to be opposed to that under the command of his countryman Kep-pel ; and witll an insulting air asked him what he thought&nbsp;would be the consequence of their meeting. “ That my&nbsp;countryman will carry your highness with him to learn&nbsp;English,” was the high-spirited reply. These statements&nbsp;do not perhaps rest on sufficient authority ; but we learn&nbsp;from his own correspondence, that Maréchal Biron expressed his willingness to advance whatever sum he might require, even to the amount of two thousand pounds. Having accepted a loan of a thousand louis, he w-as in 1778 enabled to pay his bills in Paris, and to revisit his own country. He was speedily enabled to discharge this debt, and&nbsp;to make a satisfactory arrangement with his creditors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the 1st of October 1779, Rodney was appointed commander-in-chief of Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His first exploit after this appointment was on the 8th of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">January ensuing, when he took sixteen Spanish transports, together with seven ships and vessels of war, which had&nbsp;left St Sebastian’s a week before. On the 16th of the&nbsp;same month he fell in with the Spanish fleet, consisting of&nbsp;eleven sail of the line, under the command of Don Juan de&nbsp;Langara ; of which one was blown up during the engagement, five were taken and carried into Gibraltar, among&nbsp;which was the admiral’s ship, and the rest were much shattered. In April the same year, he fell in with the French&nbsp;fleet under the command of Admiral Guichen, at Martinique, whom he compelled to fight, and whom he com</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">pletely beat ; though, from the shattered state of his own fleet, and the unwillingness of the enemy to risk another&nbsp;action, he took none of their ships. The successful efforts&nbsp;of the gallant admiral during the year 1780 were generally&nbsp;applauded through the nation. He received the thanks of&nbsp;both houses of parliament, and addresses of thanks from&nbsp;various parts of Great Britain, and the islands to which his&nbsp;victories were more particularly serviceable. In December&nbsp;the same year, he made an unsuccessful attempt, together&nbsp;with General Vaughan, on St Vincent’s. In 1781, he continued his exertions, with much success, in defending the&nbsp;West India Islands; and, along with the above-named general, he conquered St Eustatius, on which occasion his&nbsp;conduct to the inhabitants has been much, though perhaps&nbsp;unjustly, censured. The island was certainly a nest of contraband traders. On the 12th of April 1782, he came to a&nbsp;close action with the French fleet under Count de Grasse ;&nbsp;during which he sunk one ship and took five, of which the&nbsp;admiral’s ship, the Ville de Paris, was one. On the 22d of&nbsp;May, the thanks of both houses of parliament were voted&nbsp;to the admiral, his officers, and seamen, for this brilliant&nbsp;and decisive victory. He was appointed vice-admiral of&nbsp;Great Britain, and was raised to tbe peerage by the title of&nbsp;Baron Rodney of Stoke in Somersetshire. The House&nbsp;of Commons voted him an annual pension of L.2000. In&nbsp;the year 1793 this pension was permanently settled on the&nbsp;title ; and in 1806 a pension of L.1000 Irish was granted to&nbsp;his grandson for life. Having been superseded, very ungraciously, in his command, Lord Rodney once more steered&nbsp;a homeward course. He landed at Bristol on the 15th of&nbsp;September 1782, and next day proceeded to join his family&nbsp;at Purbrook near Portsmouth. He survived for ten years,&nbsp;having died on the 24th of May 1792, after he had completed the seventy-fourth year of his age.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lord Rodney had been twice married ; first to the sister of the earl of Northampton, and next to the daughter of&nbsp;John dies, Esq. With her he did not reside for several&nbsp;years before his death. He was succeeded in his title and&nbsp;estates by his son George, who married, in 1781, Martha,&nbsp;daughter of the Right Hon. Alderman Harley, by whom&nbsp;he had issue.</span></p>

His father was a manufacturer of Sheffield goods, and by his ability and industry acquired a considerable fortune. He intended John to follow his own&nbsp;lucrative employment ; but he was powerfully attached to&nbsp;other pursuits, and his father did not discourage his rising&nbsp;genius, but gave him a liberal education. After an elementary training, he was placed under the tuition of Dr&nbsp;Doddridge, by whose instructions he was rapidly improved&nbsp;in many branches of useful knowledge.
