The Life of Leo, with the omission of the documents contained in the appendix, was speedily reprinted at Philadelphia ; but the sale was not there so rapid as that of his former work. A German translation, by Professor Glaser, was published at Leipzig in three volumes octavo, which successively appeared in 1806, 1807, and 1808. A preface, notes, and disquisitions, were contributed by Henke. In 1808 a French translation, by P. F. Henry, was published at Paris, and a corrected edition appeared in 1813. An Italian version was subsequently undertaken by Count Luigi Bossi, who began by translating from the French. This work extended to twelve volumes octavo, published at Milan in 1816 and 1817. He added a variety of notes and documents illustrative of the text, together with numerous engravings of portraits and medals. The sovereign pontiff, Leo XII., inserted this translation in the catalogue of prohibited books, but in spite of his denunciation, 2800 copies of it have been dispersed in Italy, where the name of the elegant author continues to be held in no common estimation.</p><p>Soon after the appearance of his great work, he was suddenly induced to place himself in a new sphere of action. “ Although from a very early period of life Mr Roscoe had taken a deep interest in public affairs, and had manifested, not only by his writings, but also by the part he had taken in promoting public meetings in Liverpool, the strong desire he felt to render himself useful to the country, he had yet never entertained the idea that he should be called upon to fill the responsible situation of a representative of the people. It was therefore with the greatest surprise that, on the eve of the general election in 1806, he received a requisition from a number of the most respectable burgesses of Liverpool, requesting him to come forward as a candidate for the representation of his native town.” This requisition he received on the 30th of October ; he issued his address to the electors on the following day, and the election commenced on tlιe first of November. His two opponents were General Gascoigne and General Tarleton ; of whom the former had represented the borough for ten, and the latter for sixteen years. They were both Tories, but with this difference, that Tarleton was a deserter from the Whigs. They were both supported by the corporation ; but after a very strenuous contest of seven days, the election terminated in favour of Roscoe, who had nearly two hundred votes over Tarleton, and thirteen over Gascoigne. During the progress of the election, he had uniformly been the popular candidate ; his success was hailed with the most enthusiastic rejoicings; and he was chaired through a greater concourse of people than the town had probably ever beheld on any former occasion.</p><p>Of the House of Commons he was not a silent member. He took a respectable share in various debates ; and he had the high satisfaction of raising his voice in favour of the abolition of the slave-trade. He likewise made a judicious speech in support of Romilly’s bill for subjecting real estates to debts of simple contract. The unhappy and inveterate prejudices of the king led to the dissolution of the ministry in the spring of 1807. On the 15th of April, Mr Littleton moved a resolution, expressing the regret of the house at the recent change in his majesty’s councils ; and Mr Roscoe then spoke with manly indignation against the conduct of Canning, who, in a previous debate, had thought proper to threaten the house, that if its members did not vote according to the will of the ministry, his majesty would be advised to appeal to the people, or, in other words, to dissolve his parliament. The parliament was dissolved, and the senseless cry of “ No Popery,” and “ the Church in danger,” resounded from one end of the island to the other. It was the peculiar infelicity and infatuation of the old</p><lb/><p>king’s administration, that he was uniformly averse from employing men who supported the principles which had placed his family on the British throne.</p><p>Mr Roscoe returned to Liverpool in the month of May, and, on approaching the town, was received by a numerous procession of friends, partly on horseback, and partly on foot. Their progress was speedily obstructed by large bodies of men, chiefly consisting of the crews of vessels recently engaged in the slave-trade, armed with bludgeons and other weapons, and disposed along the range of streets. The procession moved with difficulty, and not without danger. Many personal injuries were sustained on both sides ; and if great forbearance had not been displayed towards the ruffianly assailants, the most fatal consequences might have ensued. When he reached the bank, and attempted to address the crowd, the clamour was so loud and unceasing that he found it impossible to obtain a hearing. He had honourably given a vote against the traffic in human flesh, and by that craft most of the disorderly multitude had their living. Disgusted at such a display of popular violence, he speedily declared his resolution of declining to offer himself as a candidate at the ensuing election ; but he was nominated without his own consent, and the contest was protracted till the seventh day, when it terminated by the return of the two generals.</p><p>Although he thus ceased to be a member of parliament, he did not cease to take an interest in public affairs. In 1808 he published “ Considerations on the Causes, Objects, and Consequences of the present War, and on the Expediency or the Danger of Peace with France.” This was an able as well as a seasonable publication ; but we cannot add, that it produced any extensive or speedy effects. The war, which had been carried on at such an enormous expense of blood and treasure, was profitable to an immense multitude of individuals : it served to extend the patronage and influence of the ministry ; loans, contracts, and other contingencies, enriched one class of their adherents ; an immense field of employment and promotion was opened in the army and navy ; while another class of men, who were specially bound to act as messengers of peace, were too generally disposed to keep in the onward path of preferment by preaching in favour of “ this just and necessary war.” The real object of the war was a matter so extremely doubtful, that it. was not unusual to hear a variety of objects specified by different individuals all equally fervent in the same cause. By one great personage, the hopeful project of restoring the Bourbons was doubtless contemplated as the great and paramount object. Roscoe's tract was published in January, and a fourth edition was sent to press before the end of that month. It was speedily followed by “ Remarks on the Proposals made to Great Britain for opening Négociations for Peace, in the year 1807.” The several tracts which he had published on such topics, were in 1810 collected into a volume bearing the title of “ Occasional Tracts relative to the War.” This collection, which includes several tracts that have not been enumerated, remains a monument of his wisdom, in the midst of the general phrensy which then prevailed. In 1812 he published “ A Review of the Speeches of the Right Hon. George Canning on the late Election for Liverpool, so far as they relate to the Questions of Peace and Reform.” Roscoe was an able and enlightened advocate of parliamentary reform, as of all other attempts to improve the general welfare. During this general election, some of the inhabitants entertained a plan of returning him free of expense. He was likewise solicited to allow his friends to put him in nomination at Westminster ; but he had no inclination to resume his seat in the House of Commons. Some of the electors of Leicester, where any opposition to the prevalent corruption was nearly hopeless, nominated him as a candidate without his previous knowledge ; and, under</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
