But it can&nbsp;only be repeated that the variations are innumerable.

<p><span class="font1">The development of the rigging of ships is a very obscure subject. It was the work of centuries, and of practical men&nbsp;who wrote no treatises. It has never been universal. A&nbsp;comparison of the four - masted junk given above with</span></p>

In some cases&nbsp;at least a sprit topgallant sail was used. The mizzenmast still&nbsp;carries a lateen sail, but topsails have been added, and the whole&nbsp;rigging has multiplied and developed. Between the “ Sovereign&nbsp;of the Seas ” and the fully developed ship given in fig. 1 the most&nbsp;apparent differences are in the rigging of the bowsprit and the&nbsp;mizzenmast. The sprit topmast has disappeared, and is replaced</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
