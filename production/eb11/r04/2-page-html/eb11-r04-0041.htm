<p><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">liberi</span><span class="font1"> the right to petition for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font1"> opened to the nearest collateral agnates of the intestate, under their old name&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legitimi heredes.</span><span class="font1"> (3) Under the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font1"> on failure of&nbsp;agnates (and of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> where there was one), the succession was vacant and fell to the fisc, unless perchance it was&nbsp;usucapted by a stranger possessing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pro herede.</span><span class="font1"> The frequency of such vacancies was much diminished by the&nbsp;recognition by the praetors of the right of cognates to claim&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio</span><span class="font1"> in the third place. Who they had primarily in view under the name of “ cognates ” it is impossible to say.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The epithet is most frequently applied by modern writers to kinsmen related through females; but in its widest sense it included all kinsmen without exception, and in a more limited sense all kinsmen&nbsp;not entitled to claim as agnates. There were included amongst&nbsp;them therefore—although it is very probable that the list was not&nbsp;made up at once, but from time to time by the action of a series&nbsp;of praetors—not merely kinsmen related through females (who&nbsp;were not agnates), but also agnates of a remoter degree who were&nbsp;excluded as such because the nearest agnates in existence had&nbsp;declined, persons w<sup>r</sup>ho had been agnates but by reason of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis&nbsp;minutio</span><span class="font1"> had lost that character, female agnates more distantly&nbsp;related than sisters, and children of the intestate who at the&nbsp;time of his death were in an adoptive family. All these took&nbsp;according to proximity, but not beyond the sixth degree and the&nbsp;children of a second cousin in the seventh. (4) Finally, the claim&nbsp;passed to the survivor of husband and wife, assuming always that&nbsp;their marriage had not involved </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus.</span><span class="font1"> This list constituted&nbsp;the praetorian order of succession on intestacy among freeborn&nbsp;citizens. The praetorian order of succession to freedmen and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emancipate</span><span class="font1"> was necessarily different, the patron or quasi-patron&nbsp;taking the place of agnates; but it is too detailed and complex&nbsp;to be gone into here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessions</span><span class="font1"> had to be formally petitioned for. In that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab intestato</span><span class="font1"> descendants were allowed a year for doing so,&nbsp;while other persons were limited to 100 days, the period for those&nbsp;entitled in the second place beginning when that of those entitled&nbsp;in the first had expired, and so on. The grant was always made&nbsp;at the risk of the petitioner; nothing was assured him by it; it&nbsp;might turn out real and substantial </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(cum re)</span><span class="font1"> or merely nominal&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(sine re),</span><span class="font1"> according as the grantee could or could not maintain it&nbsp;against the heir of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile.</span><span class="font1"> For the latter was entitled to&nbsp;stand on his statutory or testamentary right, without applying to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio,</span><span class="font1"> although in fact he often did so for the sake of&nbsp;the summary procedure it supplied him for ingathering the effects&nbsp;of the deceased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Law of Procedure.</span><span class="font1">—The use of the formular system of procedure as alternative to that by the “ actions of the law ” commenced long before the end of the period now under consideration; and we have had occasion more than&nbsp;once to observe how greatly it facilitated the development of the institutions of property and. contractual&nbsp;obligation. But as the change was only completed in the early&nbsp;Empire it will be more convenient to defer explanation </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">qI</span><span class="font1"> the nature</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of the new procedure in the meantime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">IV. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Jus Naturale and Maturity of Roman Jurisprudence</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(The Empire until the time of Diocletian.) i. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Characteristics and Formative Agencies of the Law during</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the Period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Characteristics generally and Recognition of a Jus Naturale in particular.—</span><span class="font1">The first three centuries of the Empire witnessed&nbsp;the perfection of Roman jurisprudence and the commencement of its decline. During that time the history of the law&nbsp;presents no such great landmarks as the enactment of the&nbsp;XII. Tables, the commencement of a praetor’s edict, the&nbsp;recognition of simple consent as creative of a contractual&nbsp;bond, or the introduction of a new system of' judicial procedure; the establishment of a class of patented jurists&nbsp;speaking as in a sense the mouthpieces of the prince, and the&nbsp;admission of all the free subjects of the Empire to the privileges&nbsp;of citizenship, are about the only isolated events to which one&nbsp;can point as productive of great and lasting results. There&nbsp;were, indeed, some radical changes in particular institutions,&nbsp;such as the caduciary legislation of Augustus, intended to&nbsp;raise the tone of domestic morality and increase fruitful&nbsp;marriages, and the legislation of the same emperor and his&nbsp;immediate successor for regulation of the status of enfranchised&nbsp;slaves; but these, although of vast importance in themselves,&nbsp;and the first of them influencing the current of the law for&nbsp;centuries, yet left upon it no permanent impression. It was&nbsp;by much less imposing efforts that it attained the perfection&nbsp;to which it reached under the sovereigns of the Scvcran house&nbsp;—a steady advance on the lines already marked out in the&nbsp;latter years of the Republic. The sphere of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus Quiritium&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">became more and more circumscribed, and one after another&nbsp;of the formalities of the strict </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> was abandoned. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font1"> of the husband practically disappeared; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria&nbsp;potestas</span><span class="font1"> of the father lost much of its significance by the&nbsp;recognition, notwithstanding it, of the possibility of a separate&nbsp;and independent estate in the child </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(pcculium castrense);&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">slaves might be enfranchised to a certain extent by informal&nbsp;manumission; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font1"> constantly passed by simple&nbsp;tradition, the right of the transferee being secured by the&nbsp;Publician action; servitudes and other real rights informally&nbsp;constituted ’were maintained as effectual </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">¿rite praetor is;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">an heir’s acceptance of a succession could be accomplished by&nbsp;any indication of his intention, without observance of the&nbsp;formal </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cretio</span><span class="font1"> of the earlier law; and many of the incidental&nbsp;bargains incident to consensual contract, but varying their&nbsp;natural import, that used to be embodied in words of stipulation, came to be enforceable on the strength of formless contemporaneous agreements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The preference accorded by the magistrates and jurists and judges to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">qvzt</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> is insufficient to&nbsp;account for these and many other changes in the&nbsp;same direction, as well as for the ever-increasing&nbsp;tendency evinced to subordinate word and deed&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">voluntas</span><span class="font1"> from which they arose. They are rather&nbsp;to be attributed to the striving on the pgrt of many after&nbsp;a higher ideal, to which has been given the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;naturale.<sup>@@1</sup> </span><span class="font1">It is sometimes said that the notion of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;naturale</span><span class="font1"> as distinct from the/us </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentium</span><span class="font1"> was peculiar to Ulpian,&nbsp;and that it found no acceptance with the Roman jurists&nbsp;generally. But this is inaccurate. Justinian, indeed, has&nbsp;excerpted in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digest</span><span class="font1"> and put in the forefront of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a passage from an elementary work of Ulpian’s, in which he&nbsp;speaks of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale</span><span class="font1"> that is common to man and the lower&nbsp;animals, and which is substantially instinct. This is a law&nbsp;of nature of which it is quite true that we find no other jurist&nbsp;taking account, and it may be attributed to a habit, specially&nbsp;noticeable in Ulpian’s writings, of making tripartite classifications. But though the classical jurists are undoubtedly&nbsp;indistinct in their conceptions about the matter, many of&nbsp;them refer again and again to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale</span><span class="font1"> in the sense of law&nbsp;based on natural reason; and Gaius is the only one (Justinian&nbsp;following him) who definitely, though not consistently, makes&nbsp;it synonymous with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium.</span><span class="font1"> There can be no question&nbsp;that the latter was much more largely imbued with precepts&nbsp;of natural law than was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font1"> but it seems incorrect&nbsp;to say that natural law and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span class="font1"> were identical; it is&nbsp;enough to cite but one illustration, pointed out again and&nbsp;again in the texts: while the one admitted the legality of&nbsp;slavery, the other denied it. While the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font1"> studied the&nbsp;interests only of citizens, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span class="font1"> those of freemen&nbsp;irrespective of nationality, the law of nature had theoretically&nbsp;a wider range and took all mankind within its purview. The&nbsp;doctrine of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span class="font1"> agreed in this respect with that&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jits civile</span><span class="font1">—that a slave was nothing but a chattel; yet&nbsp;we find the latter, when tinctured with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">recognizing many rights as competent to a slave, and even&nbsp;conceding that he might be debtor or creditor in a contract,&nbsp;although his obligation or claim could be given effect to only&nbsp;indirectly, since he could neither sue nor be sued.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Voigt thus summarizes the characteristics of this speculative Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus naturale'.—</span><span class="font1">(1) its potential universal applicability to&nbsp;all men, (2) among all peoples, (3) at all times, and (4) its&nbsp;correspondence with the innate conviction of right </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(innere&nbsp;Rechtsuberzeugung).*</span><span class="font1"> Its propositions, as gathered from&nbsp;the pages of the jurists of the period, he formulates thus:—</span></p>
