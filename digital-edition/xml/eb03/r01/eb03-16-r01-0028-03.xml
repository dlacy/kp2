(from the Fr. <hi rend="italic">lonter,</hi> i. e. <hi rend="italic">repellere,</hi> to put back or bar), is the anſwer of defendant to plain-tiff’s <hi rend="italic">ſurrejoinder ;</hi> and plaintiff’s anſwer to the rebutter is called a <hi rend="italic">ſurrebutler :</hi> but it is very rare the parties go ſo far in pleading.</p><p>Rebutter is alfo where a man by deed or fine grants ⅜o warranty any land or hereditament to another ; and the perſon making the warranty, or his heir, ſues him to whom the warranty is made, or his heir or aſſignee, for the ſame thing ; if he who is ſo ſued plead the deed or fine with warranty, and pray judgment, if the plain-tiff ihall be received to demand the thing which he ought to warrant to the party againſt the warranty in the deed, &amp;c. this is called a <hi rend="italic">rebutter^</hi> And if I grant to a tenant to hold without impeachment of waſte, and after-wards implead him for waſte done, he may debar me of this action by ſhewing my grant, which is a rebutter,,</p>
