Built on a slope, with a southern exposure, the town is crowned by the collegiate church of St Quentin, one of the finest Gothic buildings of the north of France, w’hich was erected between 1114 and 1477, and has, like some English cathedrals, the somewhat rare peculiarity of double transepts. The length of the church is 436 feet and the height of the nave 131. The magnificent clerestory windows are supported by a very elegant triforium. The baptismal chapel contains a fine stone retable. The choir has a great resemblance to that of Rheims, and, like the chapels of the apse, has been decorated with polychromic paintings. Under the choir is a crypt occupying the site of an older crypt constructed in the 9th century, of which only the three vaults with the tombs of St Quentin and his fellow-martyrs remain. The town-house of St Quentin is a splendid building of the 15th and 16th centuries, with a flamboyant façade, adorned with curious sculptures. Behind the central gable rises a bell-tower with chimes. The council-room is a fine hall with a double wooden ceiling and a huge chimneypiece half Gothic half Renaissance. The old buildings of the Bernardines of Fervaques now provide accommodation for the courts, the learned societies, the school of design, the museum, and the library, and contain a large hall for public meetings. St Quentin is the centre of an industrial district which employs 130,000 workmen in 800 factories, and manufactures the fortieth part of the cotton imported into France, producing goods to the value of about £3,500,000, mainly calicoes, percales (glazed cottons), cretonnes, jaconas, twills, piqués, muslins, cambrics, gauzes, wool-muslins, Scotch cashmeres, and merinos.

In the 3d century it was the scene of the martyrdom of Caius Quintinus, who had come as a preacher of Christianity, and in the reign of Dagobert the martyr’s tomb became under the influence of St Éloi a place of pilgrimage. After it had been thrice ravaged by the Normans the town was surrounded by walls in 883. It became under Pippin, grandson of Charlemagne, one of the principal domains of the county of Vermandois, and in 1103 was constituted a commune. In 1195 it was incorporated with the royal domain and about the same time received an increase of its privileges. From 1420 to 1471 St Quentin was occupied by the Burgundians. Its capture by the Spaniards on the day of St Lawrence, 1557, was the success which Pliilip II. of Spain commemorated by building the Escorial. Two years later the town was restored to the French, and in 1560 it was assigned as the dowry of Alary Stuart. The fortifications erected under Louis XIV. were demolished between 1810 and 1820. During the Franco-Prussian War St Quentin repulsed the German attacks of 8th October 1870 ; and on 19th January 1871 it was the centre of the great battle fought by General Faidherbe, one of the last episodes of the campaign.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
