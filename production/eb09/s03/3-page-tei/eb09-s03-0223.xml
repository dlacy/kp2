The alphabet is a combination of Taylor’s and Coulon’s. By decree of 21st November 1802 a public professorship of shorthand was founded in Madrid, Marti being the first professor. Founded on Marti’s system are those of Serra y Ginesta (1816) and Xamarillo (1811). Of the thirty-two Spanish systems enumerated by Zeibig many are merely imitations or reproductions of Marti’s, and adaptations of Gabelsberger’s, Stolze’s, and Pitman’s systems. That of Garriga y Marii (1863) has attained some popularity in Spain.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Portuguese.—</hi>Marti’s son carried his father’s system to Portugal, where shorthand is still entirely unknown except in the parliament and the courts. Of the twenty reporters in the senate and chamber at Buenos Ayres ten use Pitman’s phonography, six Marti’s, and the rest Garriga’s. A shorthand society was organized in Buenos Ayres in 1880. The systems used in the Brazilian chambers are those of Silva Velho (1852) and Garriga. The reporters in the assembly of Venezuela use Marti’s method.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Italian.—</hi>Italian translations and adaptations of Taylor’s system succeeded one another in considerable numbers from Amanti (1809) to Bianchini (1871). Delpino’s (1819) is the best. The Gabelsberger- Noe system (1863) is the only other which has gained many followers. Since 1885 the debates of the senate have been partly reported by the Michela stenographic machine with fair results.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Dutch.—</hi>J. Reijncr’s Dutch method (1673) was an adaptation of Shelton’s and Bussuijt’s (1814) of Conen’s system. Sommerhausen and Bossaert (1829) received prizes from the Government for their productions. The twelve stenographers employed in the parliament use the system of Cornells Steger (1867), president of the bureau, who translated Taylor’s work and has written a history of shorthand. Gabelsberger’s system was transferred to Dutch by Rietstap (1869) and Stolze’s by Reinbold (1881).</p><p>Adaptations of Gabelsberger’s method have come into use in the remaining countries of Europe, superseding all others.</p><p>Numerous mechanical reporting machines have been invented. The best is by Michela mentioned above. For a description of such machines see <hi rend="italic">Phonetic Journal</hi> for 1881, p. 274 ; 1884, pp. 12, 34, 35 ; 1885, pp. 52, 268, 278, 291, 447 ; 1886, p. 22. They take as long to learn as a shorthand system, cannot easily be carried about, are liable to get out of order, and make a noise.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sources of Information.—</hi>J<hi rend="italic">.</hi> W. Zeibig’s <hi rend="italic">Geschichte u. Literatur der Geschwindschreibkunst</hi> (Dresden, 1878) contains an historical sketch of the use of shorthand in ancient and modern times (especially in Germany), a full bibliography of shorthand literature in all languages, a number of lithographed specimens, and a useful index. <hi rend="italic">Circulars of Information of the Bureau of Éducation, No. 2, </hi>1884 (Washington, 1885), by J. E. Rockwell, contains a very complete and accurate bibliography of English and American shorthand publications, a chronological list of 483 English and American shorthand authors, notices on shorthand in the United States, on the employment of stenographers in the American courts, on American shorthand societies and magazines, and a beautifully engraved sheet of 112 shorthand alphabets. The <hi rend="italic">Phonetic Journal, </hi>especially the recent volumes, contains a mass of information on shorthand subjects. Isaac Pitman’s <hi rend="italic">History of Shorthand</hi> (reprinted in the <hi rend="italic">Phonetic Journal</hi> of 1884) reviews the principal English systems previous to phonography, and a few foreign ones. The author draws largely on J. H. Lewis’s <hi rend="italic">Historical Account of the Rise and Progress of Stenography</hi> (London, 1816). Other histories of shorthand are by F. X. Gabelsberger (prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Anleitung zur deutschen Redezeichenkunst,</hi> Munich, 1834), A. Fossé (prefixed to his <hi rend="italic">Cours théorique et pratique de Sténographie,</hi> Paris, 1849), Scott de Martinville (Paris, 1849), M. Levy (London, 1862), and T. Anderson (London, 1882).

Walford’s <hi rend="italic">Statistical Review of the Literature of Shorthand</hi> (London, 1885) contains valuable information on the circulation of shorthand books and on shorthand libraries. The largest stenographic library in the world is that of the Royal Stenographic Institute at Dresden.	(I. G. N. K.-F.)</p><p>SHORTSIGHT. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Ophthalmology.</hi></p><p>SHOSHONG, a town in the British protectorate of</p><p>Bechuanaland, the chief settlement of the Eastern Bamang- watos, is situated in a glen at the foot of a range of Primary rocks on the Shoshon, a periodically flowing brook which flows eastwards into the Limpopo or Uri river. It lies about 400 miles north of Kimberley, with which it was connected by road and telegraph under Sir Charles Warren’s administration. For white men— traders, hunters, and explorers—it is and must always be a place of primary importance, as three great routes, from Griqualand West, the Orange Free State, and the Transvaal, meet at this point and again branch off north to the Zambesi, north-east to the Matabele and Mashona countries, and north-west to the Western Bamangwato</p><p>and Damaraland. Shoshong is thus a main gateway between Southern and Central Africa. The site was originally chosen as easily defensible against the Matabele. Water is scarce, and the present king, Khama, has taken over a well dug by one of the traders, the use of which he permits on the payment of a water-rate of £1 per month per family. Altogether there are 7000 to 8000 native huts in Shoshong, and the population is estimated at from 15,000 to 30,000. The white inhabitants—mostly English traders—number about 20. A flourishing mission station of the London Missionary Society, preceded for many years by a station of Hermannsburg Lutheran Missionary Society was founded in 1862, and has exercised a great influence on the history of the town and tribe. There is a brick-built church, erected in 1867.</p><p>See Mackenzie, <hi rend="italic">Ten Years North of the Orange River,</hi> 1871 ; Holub, <hi rend="italic">Seven Years in South Africa,</hi> 1881 ; <hi rend="italic">Further Government Correspondence respecting the affairs of the Transvaal,</hi> 1886.</p><p>SHOVEL, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sir Cloudesley (c.</hi> 1650-1707), English admiral, was according to some accounts a native of Yorkshire, but the most commonly accepted statement is that he was born of poor parents about 1650 in Clay, a fishing- village of Norfolk, where he was apprenticed to a shoemaker. Having run away to sea, he became cabin-boy on board a ship commanded by Sir Christopher Mynns. He set himself to study navigation, and, owing to his able seamanship and brave and open-hearted disposition, became a general favourite and obtained quick promotion. In 1674 he served as lieutenant under Sir John Narborough in the Mediterranean, where he burned four men-of-war under the castles and walls of Tripoli, belonging to the pirates of that place. He was present as captain of the “ Edgar ” at the first fight at Bantry Bay, and shortly afterwards was knighted. In 1690 he convoyed William III. across St George’s Channel to Ireland; the same year he was made rear-admiral of the blue, and was present at the battle of Beachy Head on 10th July. In 1692 he was appointed rear-admiral of the red, and joined Admiral Russell, under whom he greatly distinguished himself at La Hogue, having a principal share in burning twenty of the enemy’s men-of- war. Not long after, when Admiral Russell was dismissed from the service, Shovel was put in joint command of the fleet with Admiral Killigrew and Sir Ralph Delaval. In 1702 he was sent to bring home the spoils of the French and Spanish fleets from Vigo, after their capture by Sir George Rooke, and in 1704 he served under Sir George Rooke in the Mediterranean. In January 1705 he was named rear-admiral of England, and shortly afterwards com- mander-in-chief of the British fleets. He co-operated in the capture of Barcelona along with the earl of Peterborough in 1705, and made an unsuccessful attempt on Toulon in October 1707. When returning with the fleet to England his ship, the “Association,” at eight o’clock at night on the 22d October, struck on the rocks near Scilly, and was seen by those on board the “ St George ” to go down in three or four minutes’ time, not a soul being saved of 800 men that were on board. The body of Sir Cloudesley Shovel was cast ashore next day, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Life and Glorious Actions of Sir Cloudesley Shovel,</hi> 1707 ; Burnet’s <hi rend="italic">Own Times</hi> ; and various discussions in <hi rend="italic">Notes and Queries, </hi>5th series, vols. x. and xi.</p><p>SHOVELER, formerly spelt <hi rend="smallcaps">Shovelar,</hi> and more anciently <hi rend="smallcaps">Shovelard,</hi> a word by which used to be meant the bird now almost invariably called <hi rend="smallcaps">Spoonbill </hi><hi rend="italic">(q.v.), </hi>but in the latter half of the 16th century transferred to one hitherto generally, and in these days locally, known as the Spoon-billed Duck—the <hi rend="italic">Anas clypeata</hi> of Linnæus and <hi rend="italic">Spatula</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Rhynchaspis clypeata</hi> of modern writers.
