It watches over the interests of the established church, but its decrees are issued in the name of the emperor.</p><p>The ministries of state, whose members officiate in their several departments independently of each other, but sit in the council of the empire and the senate, and to the latter annually render an account of their stewardship, are distributed into three sections. The first section consists of the minister of foreign affairs, whose ministry comprises a vice-chancellor, vice-president of the imperial cabinet, director of the Asiatic department for the study of the oriental languages, and a superintendent of the archives of the empire; the minister of war, who takes cognizance of the departments of artillery, engineering, inspection, auditory, commissariat, provision, and medicine; the minister of marine ; the minister of the interior, under whom are the departments of the administration of the public revenue, police, and medicine, the minister of spiritual matters, of public instruction ; and, lastly, the minister of finance, who has supreme direction over the revenues, and yearly lays before the emperor a balance-sheet of the income and expenditure. He is also the highest authority in matters relative to the departments of trade, manufactures, the customs, mines, and the demesnes of the empire. The second section forms the treasury of the empire, into which all the revenues flow, and from which all payments are made according to the direct orders of the emperor. And to the third section belong the business of state accounts, the general direction of land and water communication, and the ministry of justice. There are likewise ministers of control, the post-office, and of the imperial household. There is, besides, a special minister of state, or secretary, for Poland, and a secretary of state for Finland.</p><p>To all the various ministers the necessary information is weekly sent from the different governments ; the whole intelligence being annually laid before the monarch in a definite form. The governors and other authorities in the provinces hold their command through the ministers. Each government has a head director or civil governor, who usually has conjoined with him a military governor. Of course, there is under these the usual train of functionaries, who assist in administering justiec, and protecting the peace of the country and the rights of the subject. How justice is administered it is difficult to say with certainty, for corruption prevails to a great extent. Alexander did much to put an end to it, and his successor has imitated his example with the most laudable zeal, but equivocal success. @@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> Conjointly with the judges are apjxjinted assessors, who must be of the same rank as the person tried, which is a plan somewhat similar to that of our jury. In the cities, two burgomasters and four councillors, and in the country, one justice and two plebeian proprietors, form tribunals of the first instance. From these, appeals may be made to higher courts established in the several provinces; and from them again to the supreme tribunals at St Petersburg and Moscow. A kind of court of conscience exists in most places, which hears verbal complaints, acts as arbiter in differences about smaller matters, and exercises power in behalf of minors and imbeciles. Great deviations from the general system exist in some of the less civilized provinces, that of the Cossacks, for instance, which has a sort of military administration. Siberia is also under a different system, as we shall see when we come to describe that country.</p><p>The civil and criminal codes of Russia are very imperfect, notwithstanding the efforts which several successive sovereigns have made to introduce order and certainty. The institutions and pandects of the Russian law were published in 1819-1823, by order of the emperor, in twenty-two volumes. The Russian government has also made public a collection of all the ukases, rules, ordinances, &amp;c. in vigour in Russia, which amounted in 1830 to forty-five volumes, systematically arranged, with copious indexes, and forming a single body of laws, divided into several codes. This measure, according to the imperial manifesto of the 31st of January 1833, guarantees the execution of the law’s for the present, at the same time that it establishes a solid basis for their progressive improvement. This body of laws became the standard code of the empire in the beginning of the year 1835. Amongst the particular laws, the ukase of 1822, abolishing the practice of branding after the administration of the knout, deserves particular mention. With regard to the punishment of crime, capital punishment was nominally abolished by the licentious Empress Elizabeth; but in reality it was often inflicted. That horrible instrument the knout may be so administered as to produce death, which often happened. However, it is no longer allowed to extend so far as to take away life. Banishment to Siberia is the other extreme punishment to which the Russian is liable for such crimes as murder and robbery. The police of Russia is a political body, and all travellers complain of its regulations, as being formal and minute beyond any thing known in other European countries. A very recent traveller thus speaks of it. “ The Russian police, whose business it is to perform the various essential duties of the civil government, are not, I think, more numerous than in other kingdoms on the Continent, where the system of form and routine is kept up; while the officials with whom you are brought in contact, as far as my experience goes, although grossly venal, and taking bribes without the smallest attempt at concealment, are always disposed to treat a stranger with the utmost courtesy. But, in addition to these acknowledged servants of the state, there is a body of secret police, who are everywhere, and most certainly spy out all the ways of the stranger.” @@<hi rend="sup">2</hi> Not only arc passports necessary to any one who wishes to enter the country, but every person resident there, whether a native or a foreigner, must have one, which is regularly renewed at stated intervals at the police-office for the district in which the party resides. A fine is the consequence of neglect of this periodical renewal. Every servant applying for a place must produce a regular passport; and there are other annoying minutiae connected with this branch of the civil service. The police of Russia is strong in numbers, and distinguished for its searching system of espionage.</p><p>The revenues of the Russian government arise chiefly from a capitation tax of two roubles on each peasant, and five on each burgher; a tax on merchants’ capital, of about 11 per cent.; the leases of the crown-lands, and <hi rend="italic">obrok</hi>  or rent of the crown-peasants, the customs, stamps, patents, various leases, &amp;c.; the monopoly of spirituous liquors and salt; the mines ; the purchase of exemption from military service; fines on smugglers and other delinquents; the crown-fisheries, mills, manufactories, baths, &amp;c.; the profits of the coinage and the post-office; and the <hi rend="italic">iassac</hi>  or tribute</p><lb/><p>@@@ Mr Bremner, whilst he does justice to Nicholas for his strenuous efforts to reform the bribing system, says, “ In spite of all his efforts, however, bribery in public offices still prevails to a degree unheard of in other countries. Even in Austria, where they understand such things very well, they are mere tyros in the science, compared with the Russians. It grinds the poor and impoverishes the rich ; it is practised in every branch of the administration, from the lowest clerk to the highest minister ; it paralyses industry, enterprise, and merit, in every corner of the empire.”</p><p>@@@ Hand-Book for Travellers in Denmark, Norway, Sweden, and Russia.
