<p><span class="font0">Rut we cannot give an equally favourable account of its influence on the ſei¢nces. There was little </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font0">that&nbsp;ſyſtem that could contribute to call forth reaſon. AVe&nbsp;may grant indeed, that if reaſon can be ſo ſhocked with&nbsp;abſurdity as to be rouled to a more vigorous exertion&nbsp;of her powers, and a more determined affertion of her&nbsp;rights in conlequence of furveying it ; in that caſe this&nbsp;ſyſtem of mythology might be favourable to the exer-¢iſe and improvement of reaſon ; not otherwiſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The connection of paganiſm with morality was too imperfect for it to produce any very important effects&nbsp;on the morals of its votaries. Sacrifices and prayers,&nbsp;and temples and feſtivals, not purity of heart and integrity of life, were the means preſcribed for propitia-ting tlie favour of the deities adored by the Pagans.&nbsp;There were other means, too, befides true heroiſm and&nbsp;patriotiſm, of gaining admiſljon into the Elyfian fields,&nbsp;or obtaining a feat in tbe council of the gods. Xenophon, in one of the moſt beautiful parts of his Memoirs&nbsp;of Socrates, repreſeuts Hercules wooed by virtue and&nbsp;Pleaſure in two fair female forms, and deliberating&nbsp;with much anxiety which of the two he ſhould prefer.&nbsp;But this is the fiction of a philoſopher délirons to improve the fables of antiquity in ſuch a way as to render&nbsp;them truly uſeful. Hercules does not appear, from tho&nbsp;tales which are told us of his adventures, to have been&nbsp;at any ſuch pains in choofing his way of life. He was&nbsp;received into the palace of Jove, without having occaſion to plead that he had through life been the faithful&nbsp;follower of that σoddefs to whom the philoſopher makes&nbsp;him give the preference ; his being the ſon of Jove, and&nbsp;his wild adventures, were ſuſſicient without any other&nbsp;merits to gain him that honour. The ſame may be ſaid&nbsp;concerning many of the other demi-gods and heroes&nbsp;who were advanced to heaven, or conveyed to the bleſs-.ful fields of Elyſium. And whatever might be the&nbsp;good effects of the religion of Greece and Rome in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">general</span><span class="font0"> upon the civil and political eſtabliſhments, and&nbsp;in ſome few inſtances on the manners of the people,&nbsp;yet ſtill it muſt be acknowledged to have been but ill&nbsp;calculated to impreſs the heart with ſuch principles as&nbsp;might in all circumftanceε direct to a firm, uniform, tenor of virtuous conduct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But after what has been ſaid on the character of this religion elſewhere (ſee </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Polytheism),</span><span class="font0"> and in the&nbsp;ſecond part of this article, we cannot without repetition enlarge farther on it here, of the Jewiſh religion, however, we have as yet ſaid little, having on&nbsp;purpoſe reſerved to this place whatever we mean to in-troduce under the article, concerning its influence on&nbsp;ſociety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3d, when we take a general view of the circumſtances in which the Jewilh religion was eſtabliſhed, the effects which it produced on the character and fortune&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">the nation, the rites and ceremonies which it enjoined, and the ſingular political inſtitutions to which it&nbsp;gave a fonction, it may perhaps appear hard to deter-mine, whether it were upon the whole more or leſs beneficial to ſociety than the pυlytheifm of the Egyp.&nbsp;tians, Greeks, and Romans. But if ſuch be the judgement which preconceived prejudices, or an haſty and&nbsp;careleſs view, have induced fome to form of this celebrated ſyſtem ; there are others who, with equal keenneſs,&nbsp;and founder reaſoning, maintain, that </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font0">was happily&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">calculated, not only to accompliſh the great deſign of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">preparing </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the w⅞y for the promulgation ⅛f the Gyfpel, </span><span class="font0">but likewiſe to render tbe Jews a more refined and virtuous people, and a better regulated community, than&nbsp;a∏y neighbouring nation. ' In the ſirſt place, the attributes of the Deity were very clearly exhibited to the&nbsp;Jews in the eſtabliſhment of their religion. The miracles by which he delivered them from ſcrvſtude, and&nbsp;conducted them out of Egypt, were ſtriking demonſtrations of his power ; that condeſcenſion with which&nbsp;he forgave their repeated acta of perverſeneſs and rebel-lion, was a moſt convincing proof of his benevolence ;&nbsp;and the impartiality with which the obſervance and thc&nbsp;violation of his laws were rewarded and puniſhed, even&nbsp;in the preſent life, might well convince them of his&nbsp;juſtice. A part of the laws which he dictated to Moſes are of eternal and univerfol obligation ; others of&nbsp;them were local and particular, ſuited to the character&nbsp;ot the Jews, and their circumſtances in the land of Canaan. The Jewiſh code, taken altogether, is not to be&nbsp;conſidered as a complete ſyſtem of religion, or laws calculated for all countries and all ages of fociety. When&nbsp;we conſider the expediency of this ſyſtem, we muſt take&nbsp;care not to overlook the deſign for which the Jews are&nbsp;foid to have been ſeparated from other nations, the circumſtances in which they had lived in Egypt, the cu∙&nbsp;ſtoms and manners which they had contracted by their&nbsp;intercourfe with the natives of that country, the manner in which they were to acquire to themfelves feulements by extirpating the nations of Canaan, the rank&nbsp;which they were to hold among the nations of Syria&nbsp;and the adjacent countries, together with the difficulty&nbsp;of reſtraining a people ſo little civilized and enlightened from the idolatrous worſhip which prevailed among&nbsp;their neighbours : All thcſe circumſtances were certainly to be taken into account j and had the legiſlator&nbsp;of the Jews not attended to them, his inſtitutions muſt&nbsp;have remained in force only for a ſhort period ; nor&nbsp;could they have produced auy laſtſhg effects on the&nbsp;character of the nation, with a due attention to theſe&nbsp;circumſtances, let us deſcend to an examination oſ particulars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although in every religion or ſuperſtition that has prevailed through the world, we ſind one part of its in-ſtitutions to conſiſt in the enjoining of certain feſtivals&nbsp;to be celebrated by relaxation from labour, and the per·&nbsp;ſormance of certain ceremonies in honour of the gods ;&nbsp;yet in none, or almoſt none beſides the Jewiſh, do we&nbsp;ſind every ſeventh day ordained to be regularly kept&nbsp;holy. One great end which the legiſlator of the Jews&nbsp;had in view in the inſtitution of the Sabbath was, to impreſs them with a belief that God was the maker of the&nbsp;univerſe. In the early ages of the world a great part&nbsp;of mankind imagined the ſtars, the ſun, the moon, and&nbsp;the other planets, to be eternal, and consequently objects highly worthy of adoration. To convince the Iſraelites of the abſurdity of this belief, and prevent them&nbsp;from adopting that idolatry, Moſes taught them, that&nbsp;thoſe confpicuδus objects which the Gentile nations regarded as eternal, and endowed with divine power and&nbsp;intelligence, were created by the hand of Gβd } who,&nbsp;after bringing all things out of nothing, and giving&nbsp;them form, order, and harmony, in the ſpace of </span><span class="font1">fix&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">days, reſted on the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">ſeventh </span><span class="font0">ſrom all </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">his </span><span class="font0">works.
