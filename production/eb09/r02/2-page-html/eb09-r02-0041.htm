<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Laughing</span><span class="font0"> is caused by a series of short expiratory blasts which provoke a clear sound from the vocal chords kept tense for the&nbsp;purpose, and at the same time other inarticulate but very characteristic sounds from the vibrating structures of the larynx and pharynx.&nbsp;The face has a characteristic expression. This act is essentially&nbsp;involuntary, and often is beyond control ; it can only be imitated&nbsp;very imperfectly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Yawning</span><span class="font0"> is a long deep inspiration followed by a shorter expiration, the mouth, fauces, and glottis being kept open in a&nbsp;characteristic fashion. It is involuntary, but may be imitated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hiccough</span><span class="font0"> is really an inspiration suddenly checked by closure of the glottis ; the inspiration is due to a spasmodic contraction of&nbsp;the diaphragm. The closure of the glottis generally leads to a&nbsp;characteristic so(ind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Innervation of the Respiratory Movements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The respiratory actions are seen from the above description to be very complicated : their regular performance depends upon the&nbsp;coordination of a great number of factors ; and, inasmuch as the&nbsp;respiratory movements do not happen invariably after one stereotyped pattern, but admit of various modifications, such as sighing,&nbsp;hiccoughing, &amp;c., we must infer that the coordination is such as&nbsp;to admit of corresponding variations. The coordination of the&nbsp;inspiratory and expiratory movements is brought about through&nbsp;the nervous system, the connexion of which with the organs of&nbsp;respiration already described must now be stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Speaking very generally, there is a nervous centre in the cerebro-spinal axis from which certain nerve fibres proceed to the&nbsp;muscles of respiration ; these are called the efferent or centrifugal&nbsp;fibres. There are other fibres which run from the peripheral parts&nbsp;of the body towards the same centre and exert a control over it ;&nbsp;these are called afferent or centripetal. The impulses to movement&nbsp;start from the centre and travel down the efferent fibres to the&nbsp;muscles, while impressions arising in the periphery of the body are&nbsp;carried along the afferent fibres to the centre and modify its action.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Respiratory Centre.—</span><span class="font0">There is a portion of the medulla oblongata destruction of which causes immediate and permanent&nbsp;cessation of all respiratory movements. This spot has been found&nbsp;to lie in the grey substance near the tip or nib of the calamus&nbsp;scriptorius ; it extends on both sides of the middle line, and has received the name of “ le nœud vital ” (Flourens). If the spinal cord&nbsp;be severed immediately below the spot, all respiratory movements&nbsp;in the parts of the body below the level of section cease at once,&nbsp;while movements of respiration in parts situated above the level </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{e.g.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in the face) continue momentarily. If the severance be made&nbsp;above the vital knot, the facial movements of respiration cease,&nbsp;while those of the trunk continue. The nervous centre is bilateral,&nbsp;each half serving its proper side of the body ; if the medulla&nbsp;oblongata be split longitudinally in the middle line, through the&nbsp;nœud vital, respiration goes on unchecked ; but if one lateral half&nbsp;of the vital area be destroyed, respiration at once ceases on the&nbsp;same side of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While the above hypothesis of a respiratory centre in the medulla presiding over the movements of respiration is in all probability&nbsp;substantially correct, it must be stated that, in certain circumstances of experiment </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> when the animal is young and has been&nbsp;poisoned with strychnia, or is kept in a warm chamber), respiratory movements do occur even when the medulla oblongata with&nbsp;the nœud vital has been removed. That is to say, there are centres&nbsp;in the cord of a lower order than the medullary respiratory centre&nbsp;which are under ordinary circumstances dependent on the main&nbsp;centre but which may act independently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The respiratory centre must be regarded as the seat of origin of the impulses which cause the muscular movements of inspiration&nbsp;and expiration. During the whole of intra-uterine life the centre&nbsp;is inactive, but almost immediately after the child is born, or the&nbsp;placental circulation is interrupted by compression of the umbilical&nbsp;blood-vessels, the centre becomes quickened, and fails not to yield&nbsp;the appropriate stimulus at short intervals during the whole afterperiod of life. It is impossible to resist the conclusion that the&nbsp;immediate cause of the activity of the respiratory centre is the&nbsp;impure and impoverished state of the blood, which it is the&nbsp;function of respiration to remedy. So long as the placenta performs&nbsp;the function of purifying the blood of the fœtus and supplying&nbsp;it with oxygen the respiratory centre is quiescent ; the moment&nbsp;the placenta becomes incapable of purifying the fœtal blood, as,&nbsp;for example, when the mother is suffocated or asphyxiated, the&nbsp;respiratory centre prepares to act and respiratory movements follow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If it is true that the presence of impure or venous blood in the respiratory centre is the cause of the first respiratory act of an&nbsp;animal, it is also true that the presence of highly arterialized&nbsp;blood is sufficient to render the centre absolutely inactive again.&nbsp;If air or oxygen gas be driven through the lungs of an animal and&nbsp;allowed to escape through holes made in the chest walls, the&nbsp;blood becomes so rapidly and perfectly purified that the whole&nbsp;vascular system is filled with the pure blood which is commonly&nbsp;found in the arteries only. In this case the movements of respiration cease until such time as the blood has again lost its purity,&nbsp;when respiration begins, as one might say, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">da capo.</span><span class="font0"> There is no&nbsp;doubt that the essential cause of the inactivity of the respiratory&nbsp;centre in this experiment is the presence in excess of oxygen gas,&nbsp;an∣l that the absence of a certain proportion of oxygen in the blood&nbsp;circulating in the body endows the blood with a power of stimulating directly or indirectly the respiratory centre. To this subject&nbsp;we shall return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Efferent Fibres.—</span><span class="font0">The fibres proceeding from the respiratory centre run down the spinal chord and emerge for the most part&nbsp;in the cervical and dorsal region. Some fibres are collected into a&nbsp;nerve trunk which takes its rise in the third, fourth, and fifth&nbsp;cervical nerves ; this is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">phrenic nerve,</span><span class="font0"> which supplies that&nbsp;half of the diaphragm lying on the corresponding side of the body.&nbsp;Section of one phrenic nerve causes paralysis of the corresponding&nbsp;half of the diaphragm. Other fibres run in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">intercostal nerves&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">for the supply of the intercostal muscles, levatores costarum, &amp;c.;&nbsp;others again run in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cervical nerves</span><span class="font0"> for the supply of the sterno-mastoid, scaleni, &amp;c. Section of these nerves leads to paralysis of&nbsp;the muscles supplied by them. The facial muscles of respiration&nbsp;are supplied by efferent fibres from the seventh cranial nerve, and&nbsp;the laryngeal muscles by the laryngeal branches of the vagus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the nerves which supply the respiratory muscles, there are efferent fibres which run in the course of the vagus to&nbsp;the muscles supplying the larynx and the bronchial tubes. The&nbsp;vagi (also called the pneumogastric nerves) are two important&nbsp;trunks which arise from the medulla oblongata, and, after receiving&nbsp;communications for neighbouring nerves, run down by the side of&nbsp;the windpipe to reach the thorax and abdomen. By means of&nbsp;appropriate apparatus, of which several varieties have been devised,&nbsp;contraction of the small bronchial tubes may be readily made&nbsp;sensible and even graphically recorded. A study of the experimental results obtained after electrical stimulation of the pneumogastric nerves leaves no doubt that these nerves contain motor&nbsp;fibres for the bronchial tubes. The exact distribution of the&nbsp;superior and inferior laryngeal branches of the vagus to the muscles&nbsp;of the larynx is described under Anatomy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Afferent Fibres.—</span><span class="font0">Many nerve fibres have been ascertained by physiological experiment to have communication with the respiratory centre. For example, the nerves of the skin of the chest,<sub>t</sub>when&nbsp;stimulated by the application of cold water, cause a gasping&nbsp;inspiration ; the nerves of the skin of the sides of the body and&nbsp;of the soles of the feet, when stimulated by tickling, cause that&nbsp;peculiar series of spasms of the diaphragm which constitute laughing ; and so on. But the vagus nerve is that which contains the&nbsp;afferent fibres of chief importance to the respiratory movements.&nbsp;The vagus fibres proceeding from larynx, trachea, lung, and&nbsp;stomach certainly, and possibly also those proceeding from other&nbsp;organs of the abdomen, are all capable of influencing the activity&nbsp;of the main respiratory centre. If the trunk of the vagus nerve on&nbsp;each side of the neck be laid bare and divided in an animal such&nbsp;as a rabbit, the respiratory movements become much less frequent&nbsp;but at the same time deeper. If the end of the nerve above the&nbsp;point of section be carefully stimulated by a weak electric current,&nbsp;respiration again becomes quicker and proportionately shallow until&nbsp;in fact the natural type is restored. If the strength of stimulus be&nbsp;still further increased, the rapidity and the shallowness of breathing become still more remarkable, until a degree of stimulation is&nbsp;reached when there is no longer any rhythmical character in&nbsp;respiration, which is reduced to a feeble inspiratory spasm. These&nbsp;facts are conveniently grouped and explained by the following&nbsp;hypothetical statement. The vagus nerve contains fibres running&nbsp;up to the respiratory centre which have the function of modifying&nbsp;the native tendencies of the centre in such a manner as to accelerate&nbsp;its explosions of activity and at the same time render them less&nbsp;formidable. These fibres are constantly in action during healthy&nbsp;life ; hence, on dividing the vagus trunk including these fibres,&nbsp;the respiratory centre reverts to its natural type of slow and deep&nbsp;action. On stimulating these fibres artificially they may be brought&nbsp;to spur on the centre once more, or even carry the accelerating&nbsp;process to the point of producing continuous inspiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Experiment has, however, shown that the influence of the vagus nerve is not so simple as is here supposed. There are other fibres&nbsp;in the vagus which seem to arise in the larynx and run in the&nbsp;trunk of the two laryngeal (but chiefly in the superior laryngeal)&nbsp;branches of the nerve ; these have powers exactly opposed to those&nbsp;ascribed to the main-trunk fibres. If the superior laryngeal nerve&nbsp;be divided and the higher end at the point of division be stimulated, respiration becomes less frequent and more powerful.&nbsp;These fibres of opposite tendencies run side by side in the vagus&nbsp;trunk, and must be alike excited when an electrical stimulus is&nbsp;thrown into the nerve. The fact that the total result of stimulation&nbsp;is in favour of the first-described accelerating nerves may be&nbsp;hypothetically explained by supposing the accelerating fibres to&nbsp;be more numerous, or more potent with the given stimulus, than&nbsp;the slowing fibres.</span></p>
