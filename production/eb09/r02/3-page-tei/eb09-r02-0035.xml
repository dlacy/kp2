See Rasht.</p><p>RESINA, a town of Italy, 6 miles south-east of Naples and practically a southern continuation of Portici, is well known as the usual starting place for tourists on their way up Vesuvius, and as the nearest town to the buried city of Herculaneum. It had 13,626 inhabitants in 1881 (commune 15,593).</p><p>RESINS. A resin is a secretion formed in special resin canals or passages of plants, from many of which, such as, for example, coniferous trees, it exudes in soft tears hardening into solid masses in the air. Otherwise it may be obtained by making incisions in the bark or wood of the secreting plant. Resin can also be extracted from almost all plants by treatment of the tissue with alcohol, and it is formed by the oxidation of essential oils, many authorities being of opinion that all true resins, which are in chemical composition oxidized hydrocarbons, result primarily from the action of oxygen on essential oils. Resinous substances are further produced by the dry distillation of numerous organic compounds and by the drying of fatty drying oils. Certain resins are obtained in a fossilized condition, amber being the most notable instance of this class, and African copal and the kaurie gum of New Zealand are also procured in a semi-fossil condition. The resins which are obtained as natural exudations are in general compound bodies containing more than one simple resin and varying proportions of essential oil. These compounds when soft are known as oleo-resins, and when imperfectly fluid they are called balsams. Other resinous products are in their natural condition mixed with gum or mucilaginous substances and known as gum-resins. Varying in constitution as these bodies do, they also difler widely in physical properties ; but the general conception of a resin is a noncrystalline body, insoluble in water, mostly soluble in alcohol, essential oils, ether, and hot fatty oils, combining -with alkalies to form resin soap, softening and melting under the influence of heat, not capable of sublimation, and burning with a bright but smoky flame. A typical resin is a transparent or translucent mass, with a vitreous fracture and a faintly yellow or brown colour, inodorous or having only a slight turpentine odour and taste. Many compound resins, however, from their admixture with essential oils, are possessed of distinct and characteristic odours. A series of gradations among resins may be traced from the hard glassy transparent copals through soft elemis and oleo-resins, semi-fluid balsams and fluid wood oils, to the most limpid essential oils. The hard transparent resins are principally used for varnishes and cement, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins and gum-resins coutaining essential oils are more largely used for pharmaceutical purposes and incense. No systematic classification of resins lias yet been attempted, and there is much uncertainty as to the botanical source of some well-known commercial varieties, while the chemical constitution and relations of many still require elucidation. The following list embraces the principal resins of commerce, and particulars regarding the more important of these will be found under their respective headings.

The substances in question pass from the medium into the organism in a certain chemical form ; they pass from the organism into the surrounding medium with their chemical form modified. Regarding merely the initial and final stages of this reconstitution of chemical form, we may speak of it as being of the nature of an oxidation. This view does not profess to be comprehensive ; nevertheless, it is true that the metabolic and anabolic processes of cells, taken as a whole, resemble combustion at least to this extent that oxygen and oxidizable carbon take part in them, and that carbon dioxide results from them. Partly as a matter of tradition, and partly as a matter of convenience, physiologists have described the introduction of oxygen into the organism and the emission of carbon dioxide from it as the comρlemental portions of one process of <hi rend="italic">respiration. </hi>Although such a combined consideration is not strictly philosophical, inasmuch as it leaves out of view the introduction of the carbon into the organism, yet it is extremely convenient because the two processes referred to do, in all classes of the animal kingdom from the highest to the lowest, involve the same organs and tissues in their performance. Respiration may therefore be defined as the aggregate of those processes which are concerned in the introduction of oxygen into the system and the escape of carbon dioxide from it.</p><p>Respiration in such an organism as an amœba is extremely simple. The medium surrounding it contains a practically unlimited supply of oxygen, and is so vast that the carbon dioxide put out into the medium is quickly removed from the neighbourhood of the organism.
