<p><span class="font1">found the learned atnuſed with Dr Berkeley’s work, intitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Analyfi,</span><span class="font1"> in which an a<sup>t</sup>ttempt was made to&nbsp;explode the method of fluxions. Mr Robins was therefore adviſed to clear up this affair by giving a diſtinct&nbsp;account of Sir Iſaac Newton’s doctrines, in ſuch a manner as to obviate all the objections that had been made&nbsp;without naming them. Accordingly he publiſhed, in&nbsp;l 735, A Diſcourſe concerning the Nature and Certainty of Sir Iſaac Newton’s Method of Fluxions : and&nbsp;ſome exceptions being made to his manner of defending Sir Iſaac Newton, he afterwards wrote two or three&nbsp;additional diſcourſes. In 1738 he defended the ſame&nbsp;great philoſopher againſt an objection contained in a&nbsp;note at the end of a Latin piece, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mαthn, five&nbsp;Coſmothsoria puerilis ;</span><span class="font1"> and the following year printed&nbsp;Remarks on M. Euler’s Treatiſe of Motion, on Dr&nbsp;Smith’s Syſtem of Optics, and on Dr Jurin’s Diſcourſe&nbsp;of diſtinct and indiſtinct λ<sup>z</sup>ifion annexed to Dr Smith’s&nbsp;work. In the meanwhile, Mr Robins did not ſolely&nbsp;confine himſelf to mathematical ſubjects: for iιi 1739&nbsp;he publiſhed three pamphlets on political affairs, without his name ; when two or them, relating to the convention and négociations with Spain, were ſo univer-ſally eſteemed, as to occaſion his being employed in a&nbsp;very honourable poll ; for on a committee being appointed to examine into the paſt conduct of Sir Robert&nbsp;Walpole, he was choſen their ſecretary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1742, Mr Robins publiſhed a ſmall treatiſe, in-titled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New Principles of Gunnery·,</span><span class="font1"> containing the reſult of many experiments ; when a Diſcourſe being publiſhed in the Philoſophical Tranſactions, in order to invalidate ſome of his opinions, he thought proper, in an&nbsp;account he gave of his book in the fame Tranſactions,&nbsp;to take notice of thoſe experiments ; in conſequence of&nbsp;which, ſeveral of his Diſſertations on the Reſiſtance of&nbsp;the Air were read, and the .experiments exhibited before the Royal Society, for which he was preſented by&nbsp;that honourable body with a gold medal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1748 appeared Lord Anſon’s Voyage round the World, which, though Mr Walter’s name is in the&nbsp;title, has been generally thought to be the work of&nbsp;Mr Robins. Mr Walter, chaplain on board the Centurion, had brought it down to his departure from&nbsp;Macao for England, when he propoſed to print the&nbsp;work by ſubſcription. It was, hpvyever, it is ſaid,&nbsp;thought proper, that an able judge ſhould review and&nbsp;correct it, and Mr Robins was appointed ; when, upon&nbsp;examination, it was reſolved that the whole ſhould be&nbsp;written by Mr Robins, and that what Mr Walter had&nbsp;done ſhould only ſerve as materials. Hence the introduction entire, and many diſſertations in the body of the&nbsp;work, it is ſaid, were compoſed by him, without receiving&nbsp;rhe leaſt aſſiſtance ſrom Mr AValter’s manuſcript,which&nbsp;chiefly 1 elated to the wind and the weather, the currents, courſes, bearings, diſtances, the qualities of the&nbsp;ground on which they anchored, and ſuch particulars&nbsp;as, generally fill up a ſailor’s account. No production&nbsp;of this kind ever met with a more ſavourable reception ;&nbsp;four large impreſſions were ſold within a twelvemonth ;&nbsp;and it has been tranſlated into moſt of the languages of&nbsp;Europe. The fifth edition, printed at London in 1 749,&nbsp;vyas reviſed and corrected by Mr Robins himſelf. It&nbsp;appears, however, from the corrigenda and addenda to&nbsp;the iſt volume of the Biographia Britannica, printed in&nbsp;the beginning of the fourth volume of that work, that</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Robins was only conſulted with reſpect to the diſ-poſition of the drawings, and that he had left England before the book was printed. Whether this be the&nbsp;fact, as it is aſſerted to be by the widow of Mr Walter,&nbsp;it is not for us to determine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is certain, however, that Mr Robins acquired the fame, and he was ſoon after deſired to compoſe an apology for the unfortunate affair at Preſtonpans in Scotland, which was prefixed as a preface to The Report&nbsp;of the Proceedings of the Board of General Officers on&nbsp;their Examination into the Conduct of Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope ; and this preface was eſteemed&nbsp;a maſterpiece in its kind. He afterwards, through the&nbsp;intereſt of Lord Anion, contributed to the improvements made in the Royal Obſervatory at Greenwich.&nbsp;Having thus eſtabliſhed his reputation, he was offered&nbsp;the choice of two conſiderable employments ; either to-go to Paris as one of the commiſſarie? for adjnſting the&nbsp;limits of Arcadia, or to be engineer-general to the Eaſt&nbsp;India company. He choſe the latter, and arrived in&nbsp;the Eaſt Indies in 1750; but the climate not agreeing with his conſtitution, he died there the year following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROBINSON (the moſt Rev. Sir Richard), archbiſhop of Armagh and Lord Rokeby, was immediately deſeended from the Robinſons of Rokeby in the North&nbsp;Riding of the county of York, and was born in 1709.&nbsp;He was educated at Weſtminſter ſchool, from whence&nbsp;he was elected to Chriſt-Church, Oxford, in 1726.&nbsp;After continuing his ſtudies there the uſual time, Doctor Blackburne, archbiſhop of York, appointed him his.&nbsp;chaplain, and collated him firſt to the rectory of Elton,&nbsp;in the Eaſt Riding of Yorkſhire, and next to the prebend of Grindal, in the cathedral of York. In 1751&nbsp;he attended the Duke of Dorſet, lord-lieutenant of Ireland, to that kingdom, as his firſt chaplain, and the&nbsp;ſame year was promoted to the biſhopric of Killala. A.&nbsp;family connection with the Earl of Holderneffe, who&nbsp;was ſecretary of ſtate that year, with the Earl of Sandwich and other noblemen related to him, opened the&nbsp;faireſt proſpects of attaining to the firſt dignity in the&nbsp;Iriſh church. Accordingly in 1759 he was tranſlated&nbsp;to the united fees of Leighlin and Ferns, and in&nbsp;1761 to Kildare. The Duke of Northumberland being appointed to the lieutenancy of Ireland in 1765,&nbsp;he was advanced to the primacy of Armagh, made lord-almoner, and vice-chancellor of the univerlity of Dublin. When Lord Harcourt was lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1777, the king was phaſed by privy-ſeal at St&nbsp;James’s, February 6th, and by patent at Dublin the&nbsp;26th of the ſame month, to create him Baron Rokeby&nbsp;of Armagh, with remainder to Matthew Robinſon of&nbsp;Weil Layton, Eſq; and in j 783 he was appointed prelate to the moſt illuſtrious order of St Patrick. On&nbsp;the death of the Duke of Rutland lord-lieutenant of&nbsp;Ireland in 1787, he was nominated one of the lords-juſtices of that kingdom. Sir William Robinſon, his&nbsp;brother, dying in 1785, the primate ſucceeded to the&nbsp;title of baronet, and is the ſurvivor in the direct male,&nbsp;line of the Robinſons of Rokeby, being the 8th in de-ſeent from William of Kendal. His grace died at&nbsp;Clifton near Briſtol in the end of October 1794.</span></p>
