<p><span class="font2">absent, and clavicles and interclavicles forming the epi-and endo-plastral elements of the plastron, the shoulder-girdle is&nbsp;nowhere in contact with the skeleton except at its dorsal end.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Fore Limbs.—</span><span class="font2">The humerus has near its upper end a median process, and at a variable distance a lateral process, near which&nbsp;is the biceps-fossa. Above the radial or outer condyle exists&nbsp;a foramen for the passage of the radial nerve in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span><span class="font2"> in&nbsp;the Lacertilia, andln many Chelonians, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Cholone</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">such an ectepicondylar foramen is absent in crocodiles. Above&nbsp;the ulnar condyle exists, but only in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span><span class="font2"> the entepi-condylar foramen, for the passage of the nervus medianus and&nbsp;brachial vessels. Thus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font2"> alone possesses both foramina,&nbsp;the crocodiles neither.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ulna and radius always remain distinct; the former is generally the stouter although not always the larger bone. The&nbsp;carpus may contain as many as 12 separate elements:&nbsp;ulnare, intermedium, radiale, 2 centraba, a pisiform on the&nbsp;ulnar and a small nodule in a corresponding · position on the&nbsp;medial side, and 5 distal carpals. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font2"> the centralia&nbsp;are sometimes fused into one, and the radial nodule is absent ;&nbsp;the numbers of phalanges are, 2, 3, 4, 4 and 3 proceeding from&nbsp;the first to the fifth finger. The carpus of the Chelonia is likewise primitive, with various unimportant reductions; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chelydra&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">possesses one or two centralia, whilst pisiform and extra radial&nbsp;are absent; both these bones are present in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Emys,</span><span class="font2"> but the&nbsp;centrale fuses with the radial carpal, and the fourth and fifth&nbsp;distal carpal are fused together. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo</span><span class="font2"> the pisiform is small;&nbsp;intermedium, centrale and radiale are represented by one bone&nbsp;only, and the first, second and third distal carpals are fused,&nbsp;whilst the two remaining are free. In the marine turtles the&nbsp;fore limbs are transformed into paddles; thc ulna is considerably&nbsp;shorter than the radius; all the normaI nine carpal elements&nbsp;remain distinct; the pisiform is much enlarged, helping to&nbsp;increase the paddling surface, and it has moved from the ulnar&nbsp;carpal to the side of the fifth distal carpal. The three middle&nbsp;fingers and toes have mostly 3 phalanges; the pollex and hallux&nbsp;have always 2 ; the number of phalanges of the fifth finger&nbsp;varies from 3 to 1, of the fifth toe from 2 to 0. The greatest&nbsp;reduction occurs in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo</span><span class="font2"> and its allied genera of typicaI&nbsp;land-tortoises, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Homopiis, Pyxis</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cinixys,</span><span class="font2"> the formula for the&nbsp;fingers being 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 or 1, and 2, 2, 2, 2, 0 for the toes. In&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">PHomedusa</span><span class="font2"> all the fingers possess 2 free phalanges only, owing to&nbsp;fusion of the first and second phalanges with each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Considerable advance is marked by the Crocodiles. The intermedium and centrale are lost, the pisiform is small, ulnar&nbsp;and radiale are considerably elongated and enlarged. Of the&nbsp;distal carpals the two last are fused into one bone, and the&nbsp;three first, together with the central, are transformed into a&nbsp;pad-like cartilaginous and ligamentous piece between the large&nbsp;radial and the first and second finger, to which the pad is firmly&nbsp;attached. The other fingers articulate with the “ huma turn.”&nbsp;The result of the whole arrangement is the formation of two&nbsp;main joints, one between fore arm and carpus, the other inter-carpal. The number of phalanges is 2, 3, 4, 4, 3.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The conditions prevailing in Lacertilia are connected with those of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon.</span><span class="font2"> The intermedium is lost, the other normal&nbsp;carpalia are present, also the pisiform; the first distal carpal&nbsp;is much reduced and the correspondingly enlarged radial carpal&nbsp;comes into articulating contact with the first metacarpal. The&nbsp;numbers of phalanges are 2, 3, 4, 4, and 2 or<sub>t</sub>3 for the fifth finger.&nbsp;The hand of the chameleons is most modified; the first three&nbsp;fingers form an inner bundle opposed to the outer or fourth and&nbsp;fifth fingers; in correlation herewith the third and fourth distaI&nbsp;carpals are fused into one rather Iargê mass; the other elements&nbsp;remain free, and A. Stecker has found a smalI intermedium&nbsp;present in the young, in a position which indicates that its&nbsp;subsequent absence is due to loss, not fusion with neighbouring&nbsp;elements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Pelvic Girdle.—</span><span class="font2">The ilium is attached to the vertebral column by* means of the two Sacraljribs.@@<sup>1</sup> The ischia and the&nbsp;pubic bones join the ilium at the acetabulum, which is not&nbsp;perforated, except in crocodiles. The ischia and pubes invariably&nbsp;form symphyses at their ventral ends, except the so-called pubes&nbsp;of the crocodiles, and these two symphyses are further continuous with each other, dividing the pubo-ischiadic space into&nbsp;a right and left foramen obturatum of very variable size. They&nbsp;are small and round in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo,</span><span class="font2"> divided by a broad, bony bridge,&nbsp;larger in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone,</span><span class="font2"> separated by a chiefly ligamentous, partly&nbsp;cartilaginous string; largest they are in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font2"> and in the&nbsp;Lacertilia. Frequently the symphysial portion at the anterior&nbsp;end of the pubic symphysis remains cartilaginous, unpaired,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> in most Chelonians and Lacertilians, comparable with the&nbsp;epipubis of Urodela. A corresponding cartilage, the os cloacae&nbsp;or hypoischium, is continued backwards, from the ischiadic&nbsp;symphysis towards the vent, serving for the attachment of&nbsp;sphincter muscles; it occurs in many lizards and tortoises.&nbsp;In the Chelonians the pubic bones are generally much stronger&nbsp;than the ischia, and they send out each a strong lateral pubic&nbsp;process, directed forwards and outwards; the obturator nerve&nbsp;passes through the wide obturator foramen. In the pleuro-dirous tortoises the ends of the ilia and those of the lateral&nbsp;processes of the pubes are much broadened and firmly anchy-losed with the posterior costal plates and with the Xiphiplastron&nbsp;respectively. The whole pelvis, like the shoulder-girdle, Iies&nbsp;inside the body. The pelvis of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font2"> is essentially like&nbsp;that of the Lacertilia. The pubes are slender ; they send out a&nbsp;pair of lateral processes, near the base of which the obturator&nbsp;nerve pierces the shaft of its pubis. This lateral process is the&nbsp;homologue of the long, slender pubis of birds. The chameleons’&nbsp;pelvis is peculiar. Ibe pubes are devoid of lateral processes,&nbsp;but from their anterior end arises a pair of small cartilages, in&nbsp;a transverse direction; their ends are connected by ligament&nbsp;with the median anterior portion of the ischiadic symphysis.&nbsp;The crocodilian pelvis is very aberrant. The ilium is broad&nbsp;and sends two processes to the acetabulum, which retains a&nbsp;foramen;* the posterior process articulates movably with the&nbsp;ischium; the preacetabular process fuses in very young specimens with a separate, ossifying, cartilaginous piece, which then&nbsp;forms a rough joint with the anterior portion or process of the&nbsp;ischium, which closes the acetabulum on its ventral side. To this&nbsp;anterior ischiadic process is attached the freely-movable, club-shaped bone, generally called pubis. The homologies of these&nbsp;cIub-shaped bones and of the small bone mentioned above are&nbsp;not clear. The club-shaped bones remain asunder; the ischia&nbsp;form a long and firm symphysis. The obturator nerve passes&nbsp;out of the pelvis between the ischium and the cIub-shaped bone,&nbsp;close to the posterior margin of the latter.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> In all reptiles, except a few fossil groups, the ilio-sacral connexion is post-acetabular, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> it lies in a transverse plane tailwards from</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">posterior limbs</span><span class="font2"> show<sup>7</sup> essentially the same composition as the fore limbs, but the modifications in the various reptilian&nbsp;orders are much greater. The femur has generaUy a well-marked neck. Fibula and tibia remain distinct; the former&nbsp;usually shows a reduction in thickness. In the tarsus we&nbsp;observe never more than two proximal tarsal elements, a reduction due either to the suppression of the intermedium or to&nbsp;its enlargement and concomitant loss of the tibial element.&nbsp;The least-modified foot-skeleton is that of the Chelydridae, the&nbsp;lowest Chelonians. The proximal row is composed of a fibulare,&nbsp;and a much larger piece articulates with both tibia and fibula,&nbsp;the “ astragalus” ; the centrale is present; the first threo distal&nbsp;tarsaIs remain separate, each carrying a toe. The fused fourth&nbsp;and fifth tarsals carry the fourth toe, and, laterally attached,&nbsp;the hook-shaped fifth metatarsal. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chelone</span><span class="font2"> shows the same&nbsp;arrangement, except that the centrale is fused with the astragalus; in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tesludo, Ernys,</span><span class="font2"> the fibulare, astragalus and centrale&nbsp;are fused into one broad mass, with the result of forming a cruro-tarsal and an intertarsal joint. The same arrangement reached&nbsp;by the Testudinidae is universal in the Lacertae, with the further&nbsp;modification that the three first distal tarsaIs fuse on to the&nbsp;proximal ends of their respective metatarsals. Most aberrant&nbsp;is the tarsus of ChameIeons, in which the first and second toe</span></p>
