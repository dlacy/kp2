            <p>SISTRUM, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Cistrum,</hi> a kind of ancient muſical inſtrument
                uſed by the prieſts of Iſis and Oſiris. It is deſcribed by Spon as of an oval form,
                in manner of a racket, with three ſticks traverſing it breadthwiſe ; which playing
                freely by the agitation of the whole infiniment, yielded a kind of found which to
                them ſeemed melodious. Mr Malcolm takes the ſiſtrum to be no better than a kind of
                rattle. Oiſelius obſerves, that the ſiſtrum is found repreſented on ſeveral medals,
                and on taliſmans.</p>
            <p>SISYMBRIUM, <hi rend="smallcaps">water-cresses,</hi> in botany : A genus of plants
                belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">tetradynamia, </hi>and to the order of
                    <hi rend="italic">ſiliquoſa ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem ranged under the
                39th order, <hi rend="italic">Siliquoſa.</hi> The ſiliqua, or pod, opens with valves
                ſomewhat ſtraight. The calyx and corolla are expanded. There are 29 species, of
                which eight are natives of Britain ; the naſturtium, or common water-creſs ;
                ſylveſtre, water-rocket ; amphibium, water-radiſh ; terreſtre, annual water-radiſh ;
                monenſe ; ſophia, flixweed ; irio, broad-leaved hedge- muſtard.</p>
            <p>1 .The naſturtium grows on the brinks of rivulets and water ditches. The leaves have
                from 6 to 8 pair of ſmooth ſucculent and ſeſſile pinnæ ; the flowers are ſmall and
                white, and grow in ſhort spikes or tufts. The leaves of water-creſſes have a
                moderately pungent taſte, emit a quick penetrating ſmell, like that of muſtard ſeed,
                but much weaker. Their pungent matter is taken up both by watery and ſpirituous
                menſtrua, and accompanies the aqueous juice, which iſſues copiouſly upon expreſſion.@@
                It is very volatile, ſo as to ariſe in great part in diſtillation with rectified
                ſpirit, as well as with water, and almoſt totally to exhale in drying the leaves, or
                in- ſpiſſating by the gentleſt heat to the conſiſtence of an extract, either the
                expreſſed juice, or the watery or ſpirituous tinctures. Both the inſpiſſated juice,
                and the watery extract, diſcover to the taſte a ſaline impregnation, and in keeping
                throw up cryſtalline effloreſcences to the ſurface. On diſtilling conſiderable
                quantities of the herb with water, a ſmall proportion of a ſubtile volatile very
                pungent oil is obtained.</p>
            <p>Water-creſſes obtain a place in the Materia Medica for their antiſcorbutic qualities,
                which have been long very generally acknowledged by physicians.@@ They are alſo
                ſuppoſed to purify the blood and humours, and to open viſceral obſtructions. They
                are nearly allied to ſcurvy-graſs, but are more mild and pleaſant, and for this
                reason are frequently eaten as ſalad. In the pharmacopoeias the juice of this plant
                is directed with that of ſcurvy-graſs and Seville oranges : and Dr Cullen has
                remarked, that the addition of acids renders the juices of</p>
            <p>the plantæ siliquoſae more certainly effectual, by determining them more powerfully
                to an aceſcent fermentation.</p>
            <p>2. Silveſtre, or water-rocket.@@ The ſtem is weak, branched, and above a foot high.
                The leaves are pinnated ; the pinnæ lance-ſhaped, and ſerrated ; the flowers ſmall,
                and yellow ; and grow frequently in ſhallow water.</p>
            <p>3. Amphibium, or water-radiſh. The ſtem is firm, erect, and two or three feet high ;
                the leaves are pinnatiſtd, and ſerrated ; the flowers are yellow, and in ſpikes ;
                the pods are ſomewhat oval, and ſhort. It grows in water.</p>
            <p>4. Terreſtre, or land-rocket. The leaves are pinnatiſid ; the pods are filled with
                ſeed ; the root is annual, and white ; the ſtem is angular, red-green, and
                ſmooth.</p>
            <p>5. Murale, or wall-rocket. The ſtems are rough, and about eight inches high ; the
                leaves grow on foot-ſtalks, lance-ſhaped, ſmooth, ſinuated, and ſerrated; the
                flowers are yellow ; the pods a little compreſſed, and slightly carinated. It grows
                on ſandy ground in the North, Angleſea, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>6. Monenſe, or yellow rocket. The ſtem is ſmooth, and about 6 or 8 inches high ; the
                leaves are pinnatifid; the pinnæ remote, generally 7 pair ; the flower is yellow ;
                the petals entire ; the calyx is cloſed. It grows in the Iſle of Man.</p>
            <p>7. Irio, broad leaved rocket, or hedge muſtard ; the ſtem is ſmooth, and about two
                feet high ; the leaves are broad, naked, pinnated, and halberd ſhaped at the end ;
                the flowers are yellow, and the pods erect. It grows on waſte ground.</p>
            <p>8. Sophia, flixweed. The ſtem is firm, branched, and two or three feet high ; the
                leaves are multifid ; the ſegments are narrow ; the flowers are yellow ; the petals
                much leſs than the calyx ; the pods are long, ſtiff, curved, without ſtyle, and
                erect ; the ſeeds are minute, and yellow. It grows on walls, waſte ground,
                &amp;c.</p>
            <p>SISYPHUS, in fabulous hiſtory, one of the deſcendents of Eolus, married Merope, one
                of the Pleiades, who bore him Glaucus. He reſided at Epyra in Peloponneſus, and was
                a very crafty man. Others ſay, that he was a Trojan ſecretary, who was puniſhed for
                diſcovering ſecrets of ſtace ; and others again, that he was a notorious robber,
                killed by Theſeus. However, all the poets agree that he was puniſhed in Tartarus for
                his crimes, by rolling a great ſtone to the top of a hill, which conſtantly
                recoiled, and, rolling down inceſſantly, renewed his labour.</p>
