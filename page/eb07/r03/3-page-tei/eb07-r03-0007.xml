A good edition of his Select Pieces appeared at Paris in 1741, in a small 12mo volume.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rousseau, </hi><hi rend="italic">John-James,</hi>  one of the most renowned writers of modem times, was born at Geneva on the 28th of June 1712. His father was by profession a clock and watch maker. At his birth, which, he says, was the first of his misfortunes, he endangered the life of his mother ; and he himself was for a long time afterwards in a very weak and languishing state of health. But as his bodily strength increased, his mental powers gradually opened, and afforded the happiest presages of future greatness. His father, a citizen of Geneva, was a well-informed tradesman ; and in the place where he wrought he kept a Plutarch and a Tacitus, authors which of course soon became familiar to his son. A rash juvenile step, however, occasioned his leaving his father’s house. “ Finding himself a fugitive in a strange country, and without money or friends, he changed his religion, in order to procure a subsistence.” Bornex, bishop of Anneci, from whom he sought an asylum, committed the care of his education to Madame de Warrens, a lady, who in 1726 had left part of her wealth, and the Protestant religion, in order to throw herself into the bosom of the Catholic church. This generous lady served in the triple capacity of a mother, a friend, and a lover, to the new proselyte, whom, in fact, she regarded as her son. The necessity of procuring for himself some settlement, however, or perhaps his unsettled disposition, obliged Rousseau often to take leave of this tender mother.</p><p>He possessed more than ordinary talents for music ; and the Abbé Blanchard flattered his hopes of a place in the royal chapel, which he, however, failed in obtaining for him. He was therefore under the necessity of teaching music at Chamberi. He remained in this place till 1741, in which year he went to Paris, where he was long in very destitute circumstances. Writing to a friend in 1743, he thus expresses himself : “ Every thing is dear here, especially bread.” But he at length began to emerge from that obscurity in which he had hitherto been buried ; and his friends placed him with M. de Montaigne, ambassador from France to Venice. According to his own confession, a proud misanthropy, and a peculiar contempt of the riches and pleasures of this world, constituted the chief traits in his character ; and a misunderstanding soon took place between him and the ambassador. The place of depute, under M. Dupin, farmer-general, a man of considerable parts, gave him some temporary relief, and enabled him to be of some benefit to Madame de Warrens, his former benefactress. But the year 1750 proved the commencement of his literary career. The academy of Dijon had proposed the following question : “ Whether the revival of the arts and sciences has contributed to the refinement of manners ?” Rousseau at first inclined to support the affirmative. “ Take the negative side of the question,” said a philosopher, who was at that time his friend, “ and I’ll promise you the greatest success.”</p><p>His discourse against the sciences having been found to be the best written, and replete with brilliant reasoning, was publicly crowned with the approbation of that learned body. Never was a paradox supported with greater eloquence. It was not however a new one ; but he enriched it with all the advantages which either knowledge or genius could confer upon it. Immediately after its appearance, he met with several opponents of his tenets, which he defended ; and, from one dispute to another, he found himself involved in a formidable train of correspondence, without having ever almost dreamed of such opposition. From that period he decreased in happiness as he increased in celebrity. His Discourse on the Causes of Inequality amongst Mankind, and on the Origin of Social Compacts, was written with a view to prove that mankind are equal ; that they were bom to live apart from each other ; and that they have perverted the order of nature in forming societies. He bestows the highest praise on the State of Nature, and deprecates the idea of every social compact. By presenting this performance to the magistrates of Geneva, he was received again into his native country, and reinstated in all the privileges and rights of a citizen, after having with much difficulty prevailed on himself to abjure the Catholic religion. He soon returned to France, however, and lived for some time in Paris. He afterwards gave himself up to retirement, partly to escape the shafts of criticism, and partly to follow the regimen which the strangury, with which he was afflicted, necessarily required. This is an important epoch in the history of his life, as it was owing to this circumstance, perhaps, that we have the most elegant works that have proceeded from his pen. His Letter to M. d’Alembert on the design of erecting a theatre at Geneva, written in his retirement, and published in the year 1757, contains, along with some paradoxes, some very important and well-handled truths. This letter first drew down upon him the envy of Voltaire, and was the cause of those indignities with which that author never ceased to load him. Although so great an enemy to theatrical representations, he caused a comedy to be printed ; and in 1752 he gave to the theatre a pastoral, called the Village Conjuror, of which he composed the poetry and the music, both of them abounding with sentiment and elegance, and full of innocent rural simplicity. His Dictionary of Music affords several excellent articles; some of them, however, are extremely inaccurate. “ This work,” says M. la Borde, in his Essay on Music, “ has need to be written over again, to save much trouble to those who wish to study it, and prevent them from falling into errors, which it is difficult to avoid, from the engaging manner in which Rousseau drags along his readers.” Soon after the rapid success of his Village Conjuror, he published a Letter on French Music, or rather against French Music, written with equal freedom and liveliness. The exasperated partisans of French comedy treated him with as much fury as if he had conspired against the state; and a crowd of enthusiasts spent their strength and outcries against him. He was insulted, menaced, and lampooned.</p><p>That interesting and tender style which is so conspicuous throughout the Village Conjuror, animates several letters in the <hi rend="italic">Nouvelle Heloise,</hi>  which was published in 1761 in 12mo. This epistolary romance, of which the plot is ill managed, and the arrangement bad, like most other works of genius, has its beauties as well as its faults. Some of the letters are indeed admirable, from the force and warmth of expression, from an effervescence of sentiment, and from the irregularity of ideas which always characterize a passion carried to its height. In the Heloise, Rousseau’s unlucky talent of rendering every thing problematical appears very conspicuous. This is the case in his arguments in favour of and against duelling, which afford an apology for suicide, and a just condemnation of it; his facility in palliating the crime of adultery, and his strong reasons to make it abhorred ; his declamations against social happiness, and transports in favour of humanity; his violent rhapsodies against philosophers, and his rage for adopting their opinions ; the existence of God attacked by sophistry, and atheists confuted by the most irrefragable arguments; the Christian religion combated by the most specious objections, and celebrated by the most sublime eulogies.</p><p>His Emilius afterwards made more noise than the New Heloise. This moral romance, which was published in the year 1762, in four volumes 12mo, treats chiefly of education. Rousseau washed to follow nature in every thing; and though his system in several places differs from received ideas, it deserves in many respects to be put in practice, and with some necessary modifications it has been so. His precepts are expressed with the force and dignity of a mind frill of the leading truths of morality. If he has not always</p></body></text></TEI>
