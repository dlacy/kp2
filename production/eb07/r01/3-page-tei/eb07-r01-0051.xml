But this is not a fair comparison, as speed must be taken into account as well as price; and we have no hesitation in saying that upon well managed and economically-conducted railroads, goods of every kind can be carried, with proper precautions, quite as cheap as by any canal, and with three times the speed at least. A great deal remains yet to be done in this department of locomotive transit, and the question cannot be decided on any railway with certainty, till it has been some time in operation, and the mode of working and maintaining it, and of economising the locomotive power expenses, are reduced to a well regulated system.</p><p>Many doubts were entertained, at an early period of the railway system, as to the performance of engines when snow lay on the rails to a depth which on the common roads interrupted the ordinary communications of the country ; they have however completely triumphed over this difficulty ; a striking proof of which took place on the Newcastle and Carlisle Railway; where the possibility of working the engines, under the above unfavourable circumstances, was put to the test on December 20,1836, in the deep cutting through the Cowran hills, where the snow had accumulated to the depth of four or five feet, when the Hercules engine came down on the morning of the above day. Numbers of the country people assembled to see how it would act in such an emergency, and to render any assistance which might be necessary. On arriving at the spot, however, the engine dashed right into the drift, clearing its way through, apparently without any difficulty ; the snow at the same time flying over the top of the engine chimney, like foam from the broken waves of a violent sea; and notwithstanding this and other similar obstructions, the train came down from Greenhead, twenty miles, in one hour and a quarter, and their times of arrival were properly kept up, whilst all the communications by the ordinary roads were more or less seriously obstructed, if not entirely cut off.</p><p>Hence any of the so often proposed plans for sweeping or scraping the rails will rarely be found necessary, much less the plan seriously proposed and patented so late as 1831, of making the rails hollow and filling them with hot water in winter. In the extreme case of rain succeeded by frost, thus forming a coat of ice upon the rails, it will generally be found sufficient to place a waggon, or any other empty light vehicle in front of the engine, which will break up the ice sufficiently to allow of the necessary adhesion. The effect of severe frosts on the road itself will be found of infinitely more consequence, and is an additional reason why drainage should be scrupulously attended to in countries where much cold is experienced. The manner in which frosts acts on common roads, is sufficient evidence of what may be expected on a railroad, if the water is not most carefully carried off from the ballasting.</p><p>In America, for instance, where railways were first laid down on blocks, similar to the way they are constructed in England, it was found that their severe winters completely disorganised them ; splitting the blocks, throwing the rails out of guage, and even twisting them so as to render them unfit for the passage of the engines, and obliging the trains to travel at a reduced speed. From these causes, and as it was found necessary to relay the road after each winter, blocks have in a great measure been abandoned, longitudinal and cross sleepers being generally substituted, and laid on broken stones filled into trenches ; but the evil is yet only partially remedied. It may, however, in all cases, be set down as a general rule, that where timber can be obtained cheap, it should be used in preference to blocks.</p><p>The difference, however, is necessarily so great between Iherailroadsin that country and this, as very much to preclude comparison. Some of theirs are constructed of plate rails 2½ inches wide, by half an inch thick, and weighing from IOto 17lbs. per yard; their curves and inclinations are</p><p>such, from the nature of the country, as to render cross ties more frequently required than they are in English railroads. ' Continuous stone bearings have also been tried in America ; also piles at three feet distance, as supports to the rails, which are spiked down to them without the intervention of any chairs.</p><p>Several of their railroads are carried across valleys by means of wooden trestles, well braced together, and assisted by piles; the lower ends of which in soft ground are often left square instead of being pointed, as a means of affording additional stability. These sort of roads are in several cases carried over valleys of such a depth, as to occasion no small surprise to those only acquainted with the substantial embankments of England and most other parts of Europe. It must be confessed, however, that the Americans, in the expense of their railways, beat the old country hollow ; and there are many things which we should be glad to see copied from them ; we may instance their guards in the front of the engine to remove obstacles from the road, and their long and high carriages.</p><p>Some of their lines are worked by horses at the rate of 15 miles per hour ; and on the locomotive lines, where the curves are bad, the driving wheels are placed next the fire box, and the front part of the engine is supported on a four-wheeled truck, to which it is attached by a vertical pivot, while the weight rests on friction rollers ; this management admits of a motion by which the wheels areinagreatmeasure assisted in their passage round the curves, which in some cases have not more than 300 feet radius, whilst in others they have gradients of 1 in 110, and inclined planes rising 1 in 10.</p><p>Another striking departure from the method of constructing these w'orks commonly adopted in England, has been introduced by Mr. J. K. Brunel on the Great Western Railway, with a view to an increase in speed, and also to obtain a more solid road, on embankments particularly. Instead ofresting the supports of the rails, that is to say, the stone or wood bearings, whether longitudinal or transverse, on the ballasting, where the repairs to the railroad consist in continually packing more ballast under the bearings, as they subside through the weights passing over them, or from the various other causes which affect them, Mr. Brunel has fixed his bearings at certain points, so that they cannot rise up nor go down, whereas in the usual mode of construction, it has only been attempted to prevent them from going down.</p><p>The guage of the Great Western Railway is 7 feet 2½ inches from centre to centre of the rails, and the width be-1 tween the two lines is 6 feet. The mode of construction' is as follows. (See Plate CCCCXX.) At every 15 feet in<hi rend="sup">1 </hi>length along the railway, beech piles are driven into the ground, at 15 feet distance apart, transversely ; they are driven from 8 to 10 feet in cuttings, and in embankments, they are in general sufficiently long to go about the same depth into the original ground on which the embankment stands. These piles are formed to the proper length, and driven in, without any being cut off their heads, which are nearly level with the top of the ballasting, and when this cannot be effected, they are drawn and redriven. They do not stand in the middle of each line of rails, as will be seen by referring to the above measures and the plate, but are nearer each outside rail of the tw o lines.</p><p>Tothesepilesdoubleand single transverse ties, or sleepers, sometimes called transoms, are attached as follows : A square shoulder is cut, 1½ inches into the pile, on one side for the single ties, and on both sides for the double ones ; the single ties are 6 inches broad, and 9 inches deep ; the double ties are 6 inches broad, and 7 inches deep. They are made of American pine, and when let into the shoulders of the piles, they are securely bolted to them ; the double ties are 13 inches, and the single ones 9 inches below the line of rails. On these are laid longitudinal timbers, 15 inches broad, and</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
