, <hi rend="italic">Sardonian Laughter,</hi> a convulsive involuntary laughter, so named from the <hi rend="italic">herba sardonia,</hi> which is a species of ranunculus, and is said to produce such convulsive motions in the cheeks as resemble those motions which are observed in the face during a fit of laughter. This complaint is sometimes speedily fatal. If the ranunculus happens to be the cause, the cure must be attempted by means of a vomit, and frequent draughts of hydromel with milk.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
