<p><span class="font1">Becoming dissatisfied with conditions at Portsmouth, Codd-ington and Clarke removed a few miles farther south on the 29th of April 1639, and established a settlement, at Newport. In a similar manner Warwick was founded in January</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1643 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by seceders from Providence under the lead of Samuel&nbsp;Gorton. The union of Portsmouth and Newport, March 12,&nbsp;1640, was followed by the consolidation of all four settlements,&nbsp;May 19, 1647, under a patent of March 14, 1644, issued by&nbsp;the parliamentary board of commissioners for plantations.&nbsp;The particularistic sentiment was still very strong, however,&nbsp;and in 1651 the union split into two confederations, one including the mainland towns, Providence and Warwick; the&nbsp;other, the island towns, Portsmouth and Newport. A reunion was effected in 1654 through the influence of Roger&nbsp;Williams, and a charter was secured from Charles II. on the&nbsp;8th of July 1663. In the patent of 1644 the entire colony&nbsp;was called Providence Plantations. On the 13th of March</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1644 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Portsmouth-Newport General Court changed the&nbsp;name of the island from Aquidneck to the Isle of Rhodes or&nbsp;Rhode Island. The official designation for the province as&nbsp;a whole in the charter of 1663, therefore, was Rhode Island&nbsp;and Providence Plantations. The charter was suspended&nbsp;at the beginning of the Andros regime in 1686, but was restored again after the Revolution of 1689. The closing years&nbsp;of the 17th century were characterized by a gradual transition&nbsp;from the agricultural to the commercial stage of civilization.&nbsp;Newport became the centre of an extensive business in piracy,&nbsp;privateering, smuggling, and legitimate trade. Cargoes of&nbsp;rum, manufactured from West Indian sugar and molasses,&nbsp;were exported to Africa and exchanged for slaves to be sold&nbsp;in the southern colonies and the West Indies. The passage&nbsp;of the Sugar Act of April 5, 1764, and the steps taken by the&nbsp;British government to enforce the Navigation Acts seriously&nbsp;affected this trade. The people of Rhode Island played a&nbsp;prominent part in the struggle for independence. On the&nbsp;9th of June 1772 the “ Gaspee,” a British vessel which had&nbsp;been sent over to enforce the acts of trade and navigation,&nbsp;ran aground in Narragansett Bay and was burned to the&nbsp;water’s edge by a party of men from Providence. Nathanael&nbsp;Greene, a native of Rhode Island, was made commander of&nbsp;the Rhode Island militia in May 1775, and a major-general&nbsp;in the Continental army in August 1776, and in the latter&nbsp;capacity he served with ability until the close of the war.&nbsp;In the year 1776, General Howe sent a detachment of his&nbsp;army under General Henry Clinton to seize Newport as a&nbsp;base of operations for reducing New England, and the city&nbsp;was occupied by the British on the 8th of December 1776.&nbsp;To capture this British garrison, later increased to 6000 men,&nbsp;the co-operation of about 10,000 men (mostly New England&nbsp;militia) under Major-General John Sullivan, and a French&nbsp;fleet carrying 4000 French regulars under Count D’Estaing,&nbsp;was planned in the summer of 1778. On the 9th of August&nbsp;Sullivan crossed to the north end of the island of Rhode Island,&nbsp;but as the Frenchmen were disembarking on Conanicut Island,&nbsp;Lord Howe arrived with the British fleet. Count D<sup>i</sup>Estaing&nbsp;hastily re-embarked his troops and sailed out to meet Howe.&nbsp;For two days the hostile fleets manoeuvred for positions,&nbsp;and then they were dispersed by a severe storm. On the&nbsp;20th, D’Estaing returned to the port with his fleet badly&nbsp;crippled, and only to announce that he should sail to Boston&nbsp;to refit. The American officers protested but in vain, and&nbsp;on the 28th they decided to retreat to the north end of the&nbsp;island. The British pursued, and the next day there was&nbsp;a severe engagement in which the Americans were driven&nbsp;from Turkey and Quaker Hills. On the 30th the Americans,&nbsp;learning of the approach of Lord Howe’s fleet with 5000&nbsp;troops under Clinton, decided to abandon the island. The&nbsp;British evacuated Newport the 25th cf October 1779, and the&nbsp;French fleet was stationed here from Ju </span><span class="font0">v </span><span class="font1">1780 to 1781.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The influence of Roger Williams’s ideas and the peculiar conditions under which the first settlemcnts v-z's established&nbsp;have tended to differentiate the history of Rhod ; Island from&nbsp;that of the other New England states. In 1640 the General&nbsp;Court of Massachusetts declared that the representatives of&nbsp;Aquidneck were “ not to be capitulated withal either for themselves or the people of the isle where they inhabit,” and in&nbsp;1644 and again in 1648 the application of the Narragansett&nbsp;settlers for admission to the New England Confederacy was&nbsp;refused except on condition that they should pass under the&nbsp;jurisdiction of either Massachusetts or Plymouth. Rhode&nbsp;Island was one of the first communities in the world to advocate religious freedom and political individualism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The individualistic principle was shown in the jealousy of the towns toward the central government, and in the establishment of legislative supremacy over the executive and the&nbsp;judiciary. The legislature migrated from county to county up&nbsp;to 1854, and there continued to be two centres of government until 1900. The dependence of the judiciary upon the&nbsp;legislature was maintained until &lt;1860, and the governor is still&nbsp;shorn of certain powers which are customary in other states&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Administration}.</span><span class="font1"> In the main the rural towns have&nbsp;adhered most strongly to the old individualistic sentiment,&nbsp;whereas the cities have kept more in touch with the modern&nbsp;nationalistic trend of thought. This was shown, for example,&nbsp;in the struggle for the ratification of the Federal constitution.&nbsp;Under the Articles of Confederation it was principally Rhode&nbsp;Island that defeated the proposal to authorize Congress to&nbsp;levy an impost duty of 5% mainly as a means of meeting&nbsp;the debts of the Central government. When the constitutional convention met in Philadelphia in 1787 to frame a constitution for a stronger Federal government, the agriculturists&nbsp;of Rhode Island were afraid that the movement would result&nbsp;in an interference with their local privileges, and especially&nbsp;with their favourite device of issuing paper money, and the&nbsp;state refused to send delegates, and not until the Senate had&nbsp;passed a bill for severing commercial relations between the&nbsp;United States and Rhode Island, did the latter, </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">May 1790,&nbsp;ratify the Federal constitution, and then only by a majority&nbsp;of two votes. Rhode Island, like the rest of New England,&nbsp;was opposed to the War of 1812 and the Mexican War.&nbsp;During the Civil War it sent 23,457 men into the service&nbsp;of the Union.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The economic transition of the later 17th century from the agricultural to the commercial régime was followed by a further&nbsp;transition to the manufacturing regime during the closing years&nbsp;of the 18th and the early years of the 19th centuries. Commercial interests have been almost entirely destroyed, partly&nbsp;because of the abolition of the slave trade and partly because&nbsp;of the embargo and the war of 1812, but mainly because the&nbsp;cities of the state are unfavourably situated to be the termini of&nbsp;interstate railway systems. Providence, owing to its superior&nbsp;water-power facilities, has therefore become one of the leading&nbsp;manufacturing centres of New England, whereas Newport is&nbsp;now’ known only as a fashionable summer resort. . The movement as a whole was of exactly the same character as the&nbsp;industrial revolution in England, and it led to the same result,&nbsp;a struggle for electoral reform. The system of apportionment&nbsp;and the franchise qualifications were worked out to meet the&nbsp;needs of a group of agricultural communities. The charter of&nbsp;1663 and the franchise law of 1724 established substantial&nbsp;Cfjuality of representation among the towns, and restricted the&nbsp;suffrage to freeholders. In thecourse of time, therefore, the&nbsp;small towns came to be better represented, proportionally than&nbsp;the large cities, and the growing class of artisans was entirely&nbsp;disfranchised. The city of Providence issued a call for a&nbsp;constitutional convention in 1796, and similar efforts were made&nbsp;in 1799, 1817, 1821, 1822 and 1824, but nothing was accomplished. About 1840 Thomas W. Dorr (1805-1854), a young&nbsp;lawyer of Providence, 'Began a systematic campaign for an&nbsp;extension of the suffrage, a reapportionment of representation&nbsp;and the establishment of an independent judiciary. The&nbsp;struggle, which lasted for several years, and in fact is not yet&nbsp;entirely over, was one between the cities and the country,&nbsp;between the manufacturers and the agriculturists.
