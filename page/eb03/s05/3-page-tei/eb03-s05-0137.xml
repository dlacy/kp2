They are either uſed to ſuſpend any heavy body, or to retain a cable, ſhroud, &amp;c. in a fixed poſition. Thus, the anchors, when firſt hoiſted up from the ground, are hung to the cat-head by a ſtopper attached to the latter, which paſſing through the anchor-ring, is afterwards faſtened to the timber-head ; and the ſame rope ſerves to faſten, it on the bow at ſea ; or to ſuſpend it by the ring which is to be sunk from the ſhip to the bottom. The stoppers of the cable have a large knot and a laniard at one end, and are faſtened to a ring-bolt in the deck by the other. They are attached to the cable by the laniard, which is fastened ſecurely round both by ſeveral turns passed behind the knot, or about the neck of the ſtopper ; by which means the cable is reſtrained from running out of the ſhip when ſhe rides at anchor.</p><p>The ſtoppers of the ſhroud have a knot and a laniard at each end. They are only uſed when the ſhrouds are cut aſunder in battle, or diſabled by tempeſtuous weather ; at which time they are laſhed, in the same manner as thoſe of the cables, to the ſeparated parts of the ſhroud, which are thereby reunited, ſo as to be fit for immediate ſervice. This, however, is only a temporary expedient.</p><p>STOPS. See PUNCTUATION; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Scripture,</hi> n⁰ 136.</p><p>STORAX.

At preſent, when about to describe a method oſ warming intrinsically different, we muſt pay ſome more attention to the diſtinguiſhing circumſtance. Without pretending to explain the physical connection of heat and light, it may ſuffice to obſerve, that heat, as well as light, is communicated to diſtant bodies in an inſtant by radiation. A perſon paſſing haſtily by the door of a glaſs-houſe feels the glow of heat in the very moment he ſees the dazzling light of the furnace mouth, and it is interrupted by merely ſcreening his face with his hand. In this way is an apartment partly warmed by an open fire ; and we avoid the oppreſſive heat by fitting where the fire is not ſeen, or by interposing a ſcreen. We are apt to connect this ſo ſtrongly in the imagination with the light emitted by the fire, that we attribute the heat to the immediate action of the light. But this opinion is ſhown to be gratuitous by a curious experiment made before the Royal Society by Dr Hooke, and afterwards, with more care and accurate examination, by Mr Scheele.  They found, that by bringing a plate of the most tranſparent glaſs briſkly between the fire and one’s face, the heat is immediately intercepted without any ſenfible diminution of the light. Scheele, by a very pretty inveſtigation, diſcovered that the glaſs made the ſeparation, and did it both in refraction and reflection ; for he found, that when the light of the ſame fire was collected into a focus by means of a poliſhed metal concave ſpeculum, a thermometer placed there was <hi rend="italic">instantly</hi> affected. But if we employ a glaſs ſpeculum foiled in the uſual manner with quickſilver, of the ſame diameter and focal diſtance, and of equally brilliant reflection, there is hardly any ſensible heat produced in the focus, and the thermometer muſt remain there for a very long while before it is ſenſibly affected. When we repeated this curious experiment, we found, that after the glaſs has remained a long while in this position, whether tranſmitting or reflecting the light, it loses in a great meaſure its power of intercepting the heat. By varying this obſervation in many of its circumſtances, we think ourſelves entitled to conclude, that the glaſs abſorbs the heat which it intercepts, and is very quickly heated by the abſorption. While it riſes in its own temperature, it intercepts the heat powerfully ; but when it is, as it were, ſaturated, attracting no more than what it immediately imparts to the air in corporeal contact with it, the heat paſſes freely through along with the light. If the glaſs be held ſo near the fire that the ſurrounding air is very much heated, no ſensible interruption of heat is perceived after the glaſs is thus ſaturated. We found the cheek more quickly ſensible than the thermometer of this inſtantaneous radiation of the heat which accompanies the light, or is ſeparated from it in this experiment. It is a very inſtructive experiment in the physiology of heat.</p><p>We cannot lay how far this radiation of heat may extend, nor whether the accompanyment of light is abſolutely neceſſary. The mathematician proceeds on the ſuppoſition that it extends as far as the radiation of light, and that, being alſo rectilineal, the denſity of the heat is proportional to that of the light. But theſe notions arc ſomewhat gratuitous ; and there are</p></body></text></TEI>
