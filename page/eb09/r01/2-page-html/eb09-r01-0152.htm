<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in the king power to appoint a regent under the sign manual, such regent to be one of certain named members&nbsp;of the royal family. The remaining provisions closely&nbsp;followed those of the Act of George II. In 1788 the&nbsp;insanity of the king led to the introduction of a Regency&nbsp;Bill. In the course of the debate in the House of Lords&nbsp;the duke of York disclaimed on behalf of the prince of&nbsp;Wales any right to assume the regency without the consent&nbsp;of parliament. The necessity for the authority of parliament in the particular circumstances was much discussed,&nbsp;as a reference to the parliamentary history of the time will&nbsp;show. Owing to the king’s recovery the bill ultimately&nbsp;dropped. On a return of the malady in 1810 the Act of&nbsp;51 Geo. III. c. 1 was passed, appointing the prince of&nbsp;Wales regent during the king’s incapacity. The royal&nbsp;assent was given by commission authorized by resolution&nbsp;of both Houses. By this Act no council of regency was&nbsp;appointed. There was no restriction on the regent’s&nbsp;authority over treaties, peace and war, or parliament, as in&nbsp;the previous Acts, but his power of granting peerages,&nbsp;offices, and pensions was limited. At the accession of&nbsp;William IY. the duchess of Kent was, by 1 Will. IY. c. 2,&nbsp;appointed regent, if necessary, until the Princess Victoria&nbsp;should attain the age of eighteen. No council of regency&nbsp;was appointed. By 1 Yict. c. 72 lords justices were nominated as a kind of regency council without a regent in case&nbsp;the successor to the crown should be out of the realm at&nbsp;the queen’s death. They were restricted from granting&nbsp;peerages, and from dissolving parliament without directions&nbsp;from the successor. The last Regency Act was passed&nbsp;after the marriage of the queen. By 3 &amp; 4 Yict. c. 52&nbsp;Prince Albert was appointed regent in case any of the&nbsp;queen’s children should succeed to the crown under the&nbsp;age of eighteen. The only restraint on his authority was&nbsp;the usual prohibition to assent to any bill repealing the&nbsp;Act of Settlement, &amp;c. By 10 Geo. IV. c. 7 the office of&nbsp;regent of the United Kingdom cannot be held by a Roman&nbsp;Catholic. A similar disability is imposed in most, if not&nbsp;all, Regency Acts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REGGIO DI CALABRIA, a city of Italy, in the province of its own name, formerly Calabria Ulteriore Priina, is admirably situated on the Strait of Messina some miles&nbsp;farther south than the city of Messina on the other side.&nbsp;It is the terminus of the railway round the south-east&nbsp;coast from Bari; a scheme for a line along the west coast&nbsp;to Naples received legislative sanction in 1879. The&nbsp;luxuriant gardens and orchards of Reggio have been celebrated for centuries, and the climate is so warm that even&nbsp;the date-palm occasionally ripens its fruit. The old city&nbsp;was in great part destroyed by the earthquake of 1783, and&nbsp;it is now built on a regular plan, with broad streets running north and south and cross streets climbing the hill&nbsp;from the seaside. Besides the cathedral (rebuilt since the&nbsp;earthquake), the principal edifices are the chamber of commerce, the new comizio agrario, the castle on the height,&nbsp;the Renaissance Palazzo Musitano Guerrera, and the&nbsp;Gothic Villa Leo. Local manufactures are essences,&nbsp;scented waters, silks, and byssus gloves, caps, and shoes.&nbsp;Extensive improvements have since 1870 been made on&nbsp;the port of Reggio both by the municipality and the&nbsp;Government; in 1883 787 vessels (209,717 tons) entered&nbsp;and 713 (207,179) cleared. Oil, lemons, and similar fruits,&nbsp;essences, silk, and grain are the staple exports. The&nbsp;population of Reggio was, in 1881, 23,853 in the city, or&nbsp;including the various suburban villages—Sbarre (3622),&nbsp;Santa Catarina (1147), &amp;c.—35,437, and in the commune&nbsp;39,296.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A colony, mainly of Chalciilians, partly of Messenians from the Peloponnesus, settled at Rhegium (Regium) in the 8th century B.c.&nbsp;About 494 b.c. Anaxilas, a member of the Messenian party, made</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">himself master both of Regium and Zanele (Messina). In </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">427 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it joined the Athenians against Syracuse, but in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">415 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it remained&nbsp;neutral. An attack which it made on Dionysius of Syracuse&nbsp;in 399 was the beginning of a great struggle which in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">387 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">resulted in its complete destruction and the dispersion of its inhabitants as slaves. Restored by the younger Dionysius under&nbsp;the name of Phcebias, the colony soon recovered its prosperity&nbsp;and resumed its original designation. In 280, when Pyrrhus invaded Italy, the Regines admitted within their walls a Roman&nbsp;garrison of Campanian troops; these mercenaries revolted,&nbsp;massacred the male citizens, and held possession of the city till&nbsp;in 270 they were besieged and destroyed by the Roman consul&nbsp;Genucius. Though one of the cities promised by the triumvirs&nbsp;to the veterans, Regium escaped through the favour of Octavius&nbsp;(hence Regium Julium). Alaric (410 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Totila (549), and&nbsp;Robert Guiscard (1060) all occupied the city. It was at Reggio&nbsp;that Joseph Bonaparte received the title of king of the Two Sicilies.&nbsp;In 1860 the Bourbon garrison surrendered to the Garibaldians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REGGIO NELL’ EMILIA, a city and episcopal see of Italy, in the province of Reggio nell’ Emilia (up till&nbsp;1859 part of the duchy of Modena), is situated on the&nbsp;line of the old Via ./Emilia, 17 miles by rail south-east of&nbsp;Parma. It is a large, well-built, and flourishing place&nbsp;with a population in 1881 of 18,634 (commune 56,031)&nbsp;within the circuit of its walls. Among the points of&nbsp;principal interest are the Piazza Maggiore, with the statue&nbsp;of the river Crostolo; the cathedral, which was founded in&nbsp;857 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">a.d. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">but dates mainly from the 15th century; the cocathedral basilica of San Prospero, with its six old Lombard lions in front; the public library, which contains the&nbsp;published and unpublished works of Spallanzani; the&nbsp;museum, in which are preserved the same naturalist’s&nbsp;collections; the large municipal theatre, famous for its&nbsp;operas throughout Italy; and the municipal “ palace,” with&nbsp;the statue of Csecilius Metellus. In the neighbourhood&nbsp;of the city there is an extensive model lunatic asylum as&nbsp;well as a large poorhouse. The house in which Ariosto&nbsp;was born in the Corso della Ghiara is now municipal&nbsp;property. Horse-races are held at Reggio every year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Regium Lepidi or Regiuni Lepidium was probably founded by zEmilius Lepidus at the time of the construction of the zEmilian&nbsp;Way. It was during the Roman period a flourishing municipium,&nbsp;but never became a colony ; and, though the name is frequently&nbsp;mentioned in the course of the civil war, it is associated with no&nbsp;event more interesting than the assassination of M. Brutus, the&nbsp;father of Caesar’s friend and foe. The bishopric dates from 450 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A.D.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Under the Lombards the town was the scat of dukes and counts ; in&nbsp;the 12th and 13th centuries it formed a flourishing republic, busied&nbsp;in surrounding itself with walls (1209), controlling the Crostolo&nbsp;and constructing navigable canals to the Po, coining money of its&nbsp;own, and establishing prosperous schools. About 1290 it first passed&nbsp;into the hands of Obizzo d’Este, and the authority of the same&nbsp;family was after many vicissitudes more formally recognized in&nbsp;1409. In the contest for liberty which began in 1796 and closed&nbsp;with annexation to Piedmont in 1859 Reggio took vigorous part.&nbsp;Besides Ariosto, the city has given birth to Secchi the astronomer&nbsp;and Prospero Clementi the sculptor; and the poet Boiardo was&nbsp;governor of Reggio for many years before his death in 1494.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REGIOMONTANUS (1436-1476). The real name of this astronomer was </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Johann Müller, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">but from his birthplace, Königsberg, a small town in Franconia, he called&nbsp;himself </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Joh. de Monteregio. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The name Regiomontanus&nbsp;occur for the first time on the title !)age of his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Scripta,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> published in 1544, but he has since become best known by it.&nbsp;He was born in June 1436 and became the pupil of Pur bach&nbsp;at the university of Vienna, and jointly with him endeavoured, with such imperfect instruments as they could&nbsp;construct, to test the accuracy of the Alphonsine tables&nbsp;of the motions of the planets. After Purbach’s death&nbsp;Regiomontanus finished and published his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Epitome in&nbsp;Ptolemsei Almagestum,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> but, having in the meantime become&nbsp;acquainted with Cardinal Bessarion, who was anxious to&nbsp;spread the knowledge of the Greek literature among the&nbsp;Western nations, he proceeded with him to Italy in 1462,&nbsp;and for the following eight years devoted a great deal of&nbsp;time to the study of the Greek language and to collecting</span></p>
