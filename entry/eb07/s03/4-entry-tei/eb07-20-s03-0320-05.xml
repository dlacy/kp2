Hence Shrove-Tuesday signifies Con- fession-Tuesday, on which day all the people in every parish throughout England, during the Catholic times, were obliged to confess their sins, one by one, to their own parish priest, in their own parish-churches ; and, that this might be done the more regularly, the great bell in every parish was rung at ten oâ€™clock, or perhaps sooner, that it might be heard by all, and that they might attend, according to the custom then in use.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
