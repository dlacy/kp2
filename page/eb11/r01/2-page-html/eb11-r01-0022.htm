<p><span class="font0">at independently by Balfour Stewart and Kirchhoff about the year 1858, that the constitution (§ 6) of the radiation which&nbsp;pervades an enclosure, surrounded by bodies in a steady&nbsp;thermal state, must be a function of the temperature of those&nbsp;bodies, and of nothing else. It was subsequently pointed out&nbsp;by Stewart </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Brit. Assoc. Report,</span><span class="font0"> 1871) that if the enclosure&nbsp;contains a radiating and absorbing body which is put in&nbsp;motion, all being at the same temperature, the constituents of&nbsp;the radiation in front of it and behind it will differ in period&nbsp;on account of the Doppler-Fizeau effect, so that there will&nbsp;be an opportunity of gaining mechanical work in its settling&nbsp;down to an equilibrium; there must thus be some kind of&nbsp;thermodynamic compensation, which might arise either from&nbsp;aethereal friction, or from work required to produce the motion&nbsp;of the body against pressure exerted on it by the surrounding&nbsp;radiation. The hypothesis of friction is now excluded in&nbsp;ultimate molecular physics, while the thermodynamic bearing&nbsp;of a pressure exerted by radiation, such as is demanded by&nbsp;Maxwell’s electric theory, has been more recently developed&nbsp;on other lines by Bartoli and Boltzmann (1884), and combined&nbsp;with that of the Doppler effect by W. Wien (1893) in development of the ideas above expressed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The original reasoning of Stewart and Kirchhoff rests on the dynamical principle, that by no process of ordinary reflexion&nbsp;or transmission can the period, and therefore the wave-length,&nbsp;of any harmonic constituent of the radiation be changed;&nbsp;each constituent remains of the same wave-length from the&nbsp;time it is emitted until the time it is again absorbed. If we&nbsp;imagine a field of radiation to be enclosed within perfectly&nbsp;reflecting walls, then, provided there is no material substance&nbsp;in the field which can radiate and absorb, the constitution of&nbsp;the radiation in it may be any whatever, and it will remain&nbsp;permanent. It is only the presence of material bodies that&nbsp;by their continued emission and absorption can transform&nbsp;the surrounding radiation towards the unique constitution&nbsp;which corresponds to their temperature. We can define the&nbsp;temperature of an isolated field of radiation, of this definite&nbsp;ultimate constitution, to be the same as that of the material&nbsp;bodies with which it would thus be in equilibrium. Further,&nbsp;the mutual independence of the various constituents of any&nbsp;field of radiation enclosed by perfect reflectors allows us to&nbsp;assign a temperature to each constituent, such as the part&nbsp;involving wave-lengths lying between λ and λ+δλ; that&nbsp;will be the temperature of a material system with which this&nbsp;constituent by itself is in equilibrium of emission and absorption.&nbsp;But to reason about the temperature of radiation in this way&nbsp;we must be sure that it completely pervades the space, and&nbsp;has no special direction; this is ensured by the continual&nbsp;reflexions from the walls of the enclosure. The question of&nbsp;the temperature of a directed wave-train travelling through&nbsp;space, such as a beam of light, will come up later. The temperature of each constituent in a region of undirected radiation&nbsp;is thus a function of its wave-length and its intensity alone.&nbsp;It is the fundamental principle of thermodynamics, that&nbsp;temperatures tend to become uniform. In the present case&nbsp;of a field of radiation, this equalization cannot take place&nbsp;directly between the various constituents of the radiation that&nbsp;occupy the same space, but only through the intervention of&nbsp;the emission and absorption of material bodies; the constituent&nbsp;radiations are virtually partitioned off adiabatically from&nbsp;direct interchange. Thus in discussing the transformations&nbsp;of temperatures of the constituent elements of radiation, we&nbsp;are really reasoning about the activity of material bodies that&nbsp;are in thermal equilibrium with those constituents; and the&nbsp;theoretical basis of the idea of temperature, as depending on&nbsp;the fortuitous residue of the energy of molecular motions, is&nbsp;preserved.</span></p>

The disturbance does not&nbsp;travel into the reflector, and must therefore be annulled at its&nbsp;surface; thus when x=</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">υt</span><span class="font0"> we must have ξ+ξ'=0 identically.&nbsp;This gives </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a'</span><span class="font0">= </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-a,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m'(c-υ)</span><span class="font0"> = </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0">(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c+υ</span><span class="font0">). The amplitude of&nbsp;the reflected disturbance is therefore equal to that of the incident one; while the wave-length is altered on the ratio&nbsp;which is approximately 1-2^, where </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">υ/c</span><span class="font0"> is small, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is thus in agreement with the usual statement of the Doppler effect.

<p><span class="font0">The argument may be illustrated by the transverse vibrations of a tense cord, the reflector being then a lamina through a&nbsp;small aperture in which the cord passes; the lamina can thus&nbsp;slide along the cord and sweep the vibratory motion in front of&nbsp;it. In this case the force acting on the lamina is the resultant&nbsp;of the tensions T of the cord on the two sides of the aperture,&nbsp;giving a lengthwise force ½T</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0">(ξ+ξ')<sup>2</sup>∕</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dx</span><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> when, as usual,&nbsp;powers higher than the second of the ratio of amplitude to&nbsp;wave-length are neglected; this, when </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">υ/c</span><span class="font0"> is small, is an oscil-latory force of amount 2ρ(</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dξ</span><span class="font0">∕</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dt</span><span class="font0">)<sup>2</sup>, whose time-average agrees&nbsp;with the value above obtained. If we consider a finite train of&nbsp;waves thus sent back from a moving reflector, the time integral&nbsp;of the pressure must represent force transmitted along the cord,&nbsp;or a gain of longitudinal momentum in the reflected waves, or&nbsp;both together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When it is a case of transverse waves in an elastic medium, reflected by an advancing obstacle, the origin of. the working&nbsp;pressure is not so obvious, because we cannot easily formulate&nbsp;a mechanism for the advancing reflector like that of the lamina&nbsp;above employed. In the case of light-waves we can, however, imagine an ideal material body, constituted of very small molecules,&nbsp;that would sweep them in front of it with the same perfection&nbsp;as a metallic mirror actually reflects the longer Hertzian waves.&nbsp;The pressure will then be identified physically, as in the case of&nbsp;the latter waves, with the mechanical forces acting on the&nbsp;screening oscillatory electric current-sheet which is induced on&nbsp;the surface of the reflector. The displacement represented&nbsp;above by ξ, which is annulled at the reflector, may then be&nbsp;taken to be either the tangential electric force or the normal&nbsp;component of the vector whose velocity is the magnetic force.&nbsp;The latter interpretation is theoretically interesting, because&nbsp;that vector, which is the dynamical displacement in electron-theory, usually occurs only through its velocity. The general&nbsp;case of oblique incidence can be treated on similar lines; each&nbsp;filament of radiation (ray) in fact exerts its own longitudinal&nbsp;push equal to its energy per unit length, and it is only a matter&nbsp;of summation.</span></p>
