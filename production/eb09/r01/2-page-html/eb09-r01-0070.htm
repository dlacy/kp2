<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">above the sea, and all attempts to cultivate sultanas in other raisin-growing localities have failed, the grapes&nbsp;quickly reverting to a seed-bearing character. The dried&nbsp;fruit has a fine golden-yellow colour, with a thin, delicate,&nbsp;translucent skin and a sweet aromatic flavour. A very&nbsp;fine seedless oblong raisin of the sultana type with a&nbsp;brownish skin is cultivated in the neighbourhood of&nbsp;Damascus, but it is rarely seen in the Western markets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Raisins are chiefly valuable on account of the large proportion of grape sugar and cream of tartar which they contain. In old&nbsp;dry raisins these substances are found in hard nodular masses.&nbsp;The seeds contain from 15 to 18 per cent, of a bland fixed oil and&nbsp;about 5 per cent, of tannin. The imports into the United Kingdom&nbsp;average in value about £1,000,000 yearly, the quantity imported&nbsp;in 1883 having been 588,309 cwt., valued at £1,057,934.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAJA (English form </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Rajah), </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Sanskrit nom. sing, of the stem </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rdjan</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (in modern Indian vernaculars </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raja, rajah, raja,&nbsp;rajan, rdzu, irdsen,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> also the forms </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">red, rdo, rdna</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> are traceable to the same stem) = king, prince, chief, from the root&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raj,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> to be resplendent. In the oldest times the headman&nbsp;of any petty tribe was called rhjh from the fact of his&nbsp;being conspicuous for the number of golden ornaments&nbsp;with which he was decked out. Then raja became the common designation for a king, whether of a small tribe or of&nbsp;a large state. The constitution of all states was monarchical, mostly hereditary, occasionally also electoral, but in&nbsp;no case absolute, for the people had a voice in the government. On the other hand, the king was greatly hampered&nbsp;in his action by his duties towards the priestly caste.&nbsp;Even in that later stage of Indian civilization which we&nbsp;find portrayed in the code of Manu the king appears as&nbsp;subordinate to the priest, though his prerogative is in&nbsp;all other respects paramount, especially in the matter of&nbsp;revenue. Theoretically this system has been continued&nbsp;ever since; but practically the rdj d’s powers have been&nbsp;gradually extended, some of them being distributed by&nbsp;him at his pleasure among various officials, who were&nbsp;rewarded, not by regular salaries, but by grants and the&nbsp;profits of oppression.@@<sup>1</sup> It thus appears that the title is,&nbsp;strictly speaking, only applicable to Hindu potentates, but&nbsp;in practice it is not unfrequently used to indicate a ruling&nbsp;chief irrespective of his nationality or creed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The rights and privileges assigned to rfijfis by treaty and usage are manifold and varied. But all rAjfis are&nbsp;precluded from waging war against an external foe save&nbsp;with the permission of the British Government, and so&nbsp;none can be said to be independent in the fullest sense&nbsp;of the word. At the same time there are several princes&nbsp;in India who titularly hold that status, in so far, that is,&nbsp;as they possess the right to administer their kingdom&nbsp;according to their own notions of justice and equity; but&nbsp;even in these instances, and they are few, British residents&nbsp;are attached to the various courts, charged to advise in&nbsp;the interests of good government and righteous dealing.&nbsp;Such officers seldom fail to secure a powerful influence,&nbsp;and it is not often that their counsel is disregarded or&nbsp;their representations pass unheeded. More than this,&nbsp;when flagrant injustice occurs the British Government is&nbsp;occasionally compelled to interfere, and instances are not&nbsp;wanting when a raja has been deposed, notwithstanding&nbsp;a clause in his treaty forbidding the intervention of the&nbsp;British Government in the affairs of his state. Such cases,&nbsp;which are not frequent, are justified by political necessity.&nbsp;In many instances native chiefs are allowed by treaty to&nbsp;maintain a military force, but at the present time the&nbsp;troops principally serve to gratify the cravings of Eastern&nbsp;potentates for the outward and visible signs of power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Rdj4s of lesser note retain a semblance of power so far</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">as concerns questions of minor importance, but in grave cases involving issues of life and death the officer attached&nbsp;to the court reviews and, should it be necessary, modifies&nbsp;or reverses the decrees which may be passed. Chieftains&nbsp;in this category do not even enjoy the appearance of independence, though in many instances they are allowed to&nbsp;keep a body of military retainers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Other r&amp;jds are merely large and wealthy landholders with no sovereign rights or privileges, resembling in many&nbsp;respects the territorial magnates of Great Britain; while in&nbsp;some instances the term is simply a title of distinction&nbsp;unconnected with the possession of land or power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Scarcely less complex and varied are the conditions which regulate succession to the rAj ships of India : in&nbsp;some instances adoption is admitted, in other cases collateral succession is accepted, while again there are occasions when the customs of the family are a potent factor&nbsp;in the choice of an heir. It might have been supposed&nbsp;perhaps that the salute could be fairly taken as indicative&nbsp;of the status of the chief to whom it is assigned; but in&nbsp;reality such an assumption would be most misleading, for&nbsp;not unfrequently the number of guns was fixed in bygone&nbsp;years, and the lapse of time has made numerous and&nbsp;essential changes in the status of the various chieftains.&nbsp;So much is this the case that it has never been settled&nbsp;authoritatively what chiefs are entitled to claim the&nbsp;Western prefix of “highness.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAJAMAHENDRI (Rajamahendravaram, Rajahmun-dry), a town of India, in the Godavari district, Madras presidency, situated on high ground on the left bank of&nbsp;the Godavari river in 17° N. lat. and 81° 49' E. long.,&nbsp;and 365 miles north-east of Madras. Its population in&nbsp;1881 numbered 24,555 (males 12,290, females 12,265).&nbsp;Rajamaliendri, was formerly the headquarters of a separate&nbsp;district of the same name, but is now incorporated with&nbsp;Godavari.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Tradition divides the merit of founding this city between the Orissa and Chalukya princes. There appears little doubt that the&nbsp;city of the Vengi kings was identical with the site of the present&nbsp;town, and that this also was the seat of the Orissa power in the&nbsp;south. In 1471 Rajamahendri was wrested from Orissa by the&nbsp;Mohammedans, but early in the 16th century it was retaken by&nbsp;Krishna Raja and restored to Orissa. It continued under Hindu&nbsp;rule till 1572, when it yielded to the Moslems of the Deccan under&nbsp;Rafat Khan. For the next century and a half it was the scene of&nbsp;perpetual fighting, and at last fell to Golconda, and became one of&nbsp;the four nawabships of that government. Rajamahendri passed&nbsp;into the possession of the French in 1753, but they were driven out&nbsp;by the British under Colonel Forde in 1758. The French, however,&nbsp;recaptured it, but, finding that the treasure had been removed,&nbsp;they evacuated </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">it</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> almost immediately.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAJPUTANA, an immense tract of country in India, consisting of twenty states, having each its own autonomy&nbsp;and separate chief, besides the small British division of&nbsp;Ajmere, which is situated almost in the centre 'of the&nbsp;province. These territories lie between 23° and 30° N.&nbsp;lat. and between 69 30' and 78° 15' E. long., and their&nbsp;combined area is approximately estimated at 130,000&nbsp;square miles. Rfijputdna extends from the province of&nbsp;Sind on the west to the North-Western Provinces on the&nbsp;east, skirting the Bombay presidency on the south, and&nbsp;stretching to the Punjab on the north. It is traversed&nbsp;from south-west to north-east by the Rajputdna State&nbsp;Railway, and from the south to that railway at Ajmere&nbsp;by the Malwa Railway from Ivhandwa on the Great Indian&nbsp;Peninsula line through Indore. The country is divided&nbsp;by the Aravalli Mountains into two unequal parts (of&nbsp;which the north-western is much the &quot;larger), and consists&nbsp;to a great extent of sandy, arid, and unproductive wastes,&nbsp;but it improves gradually to comparatively habitable and&nbsp;fertile tracts towards the north-east. This division includes&nbsp;the Thur or great sandy desert of northern India, covered&nbsp;everywhere by long parallel dunes, varying from 50 to 100</span></p>
