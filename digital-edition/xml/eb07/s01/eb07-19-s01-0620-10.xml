a seaport town of Dalmatia, situated on a bay of the Gulf of Venice. It was formerly a very considerable place, and its ruins show that it was twelve miles in circumference. In a valuable manuscript relation of Dalmatia, written by the senator Giambattista Giustiniani, about the middle of the sixteenth century, there is a sketch of what existed at the time. “ The nobility, grandeur, and magnificence of the city of Salona, may be imagined from the vaults and arches of the wonderful theatre, which are seen at this day ; from the vast stones of the finest marble, which lie scattered on and buried in the fields ; from the beautiful column of three pieces of marble, which is still standing in the place where they say the arsenal was, towards the sea-shore ; and from the many arches of surprising beauty, supported by very high marble columns. The height of the arches is a stone-throw, and above them there was an aqueduct, which reached from Salona to Spalatro. There are to be seen many ruins and vestiges of large palaces, and many ancient epitaphs may be read on fine marble stones ; but the earth, which is increased, has buried the most ancient stones and the most valuable things.” Long. 17. 29. E. Lat. 24. 10. N.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
