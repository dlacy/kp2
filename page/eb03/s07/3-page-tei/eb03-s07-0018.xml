Spaſmodic ſtrictures of the urethra ſometimes ariſe from ſtone in the bladder. Sometimes in gonorrhoea there is ſuch a degree of contraction that neither ſtaff nor bougie can enter. This variety of obſtruction is known by its coming on ſuddenly, and going off ſometimes almoſt completely in the ſpace of a few hours. Of the permanent ſtricture, or ſtricture properly ſo called, Mr Hunter obſerves, that in moſt of the caſes of this kind which he has ſeen the diſeaſe extends no farther in breadth than if the part had been ſurrounded with a piece of packthread. He has however ſeen the urethra irregularly contracted for above an inch in length, owing to its coats or internal membrane being irregularly thickened and forming a winding canal. He farther obſerves, that a ſtricture does not ariſe, in all caſes, from an equal contraction of the urethra all round ; but in ſome, from a contraction of one side, which throws the paſſage to the oppoſite side, and often makes it difficult to paſs the bougie. In ſome few caſes, he ſays, there are more ſtrictures than one ; he has ſeen half a dozen in one urethra, and finds that the bulbous part is much more ſubject to ſtrictures than the whole of the urethra beſides ; that they are ſometimes on this side of the bulb, but very ſeldom beyond it ; and that they are often slow in forming, it being frequently years from the time they are perceived before they become very troubleſome. Contrary to the opinion of others, Mr Hunter doubts very much if the ſtricture commonly, or even ever, ariſes from the effects of the venereal diſeaſe, or the method of cure ; for ſtrictures are common to other paſſages, and ſometimes happen in the urethra where no venereal complaint had ever been.</p><p>When obſtructions are occasioned by caruncles in the urethra, bougies (fig. 96.) ſhould be introduced rubbed over with bland oil until a reſiſtance is met with. When a bougie cannot be introduced far enough, one with a ſmaller point is to be uſed, but not till the day following, left the part be too much irritated. They ought not to be allowed to remain long at first, particularly when they occaſion a confiderable degree of pain.</p><p>When ſuppreſſion of urine ariſes from ſwellings in or about the urethra, in conſequence of inflammation, an attempt ſhould be made to diſcuſs theſe immediately, or bring them into a ſtate of ſuppuration, and diſcharge the pus as ſoon as it is formed. But when the nature of the tumor is ſuch as not to terminate in either of theſe ways, extirpation of the diſeaſed parts, when this is found practicable, is the only probable means of relief. Bougies ſhould at the ſame time be uſed to aſſiſt in the cure.</p><p>When ſpaſmodic affections are preſent in the urethra, the remedies to be employed are, warm emollients, as rubbing the part with warm oil ; anodynes, as opium given by the mouth, but more eſpecially by the anus ; blood-letting in plethoric habits, and this to be generally and locally applied ; bliſters put to the penis or perinæum; electricity, after plethora has been removed. Some caſes may be treated with bougies ; but where the diſeaſe is purely ſpaſmodical, they are generally found to be hurtful ; though in other caſes, when the violence of the diſeaſe is ſo far removed, if they can be introduced, they are of ſervice, by relieving any obſtructions which may remain after the remedies above-mentioned have been exhibited. Coſtiveneſs ought likewiſe to be guarded againſt. The permanent ſtricture is to be cured by bougies.</p><p>Bougies act ſolely by preſſure, and by ſupporting the part ; hence they ſhould be ſo large as to fill the paſſage, and sufficiently flexible to be eaſily introduced. They are formed of various materials, as a compoſition of diachylon plaſter, oil, and wax melted and put upon linen, which is afterwards properly rolled up ; or they are formed of leather catgut, &amp;c. properly prepared : but the beſt of any are thoſe which are formed of elaſtic gum. Bougies, when properly made, can ſometimes be kept in for six or eight hours together; but the length of time proper for their retention muſt depend much upon the feelings of the patient. At all times when they give much pain they ought to be removed, and not introduced again till the part is in a ſtate fit for receiving them. They ſhould be gradually increaſed in their ſize, till the paſſage returns to its natural dimensions. They ought to be continued for ſome time after, till it appear that there is no danger of a return of the complaint.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Of Phymosis and Paraphymosis. </hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> phymosis the prepuce is thickened, and contracted before the glans, ſo that it cannot be readily drawn behind it. In ſome people there is a conſtitutional phymoſis from the natural ſtraitneſs of the prepuce. Sometimes it ariſes from the matter ſecreted by the odoriferous glands at the root of the glands being confined and becoming acrid ; ſometimes from an anaſarcous ſwelling of the ſcrotum and penis ; but moſt frequently from venereal virus.</p><p>The cure muſt depend upon the nature of the cauſe producing the diſeaſe. If the ſymptoms be inflammatory and of no long continuance, fomenting the parts frequently with warm emollient decoctions, or bathing them in warm milk, and then applying emollient poultices, or keeping the diſeaſed parts conſtantly moiſt with a cold aſtringent ſolution, and turning the penis upwards and ſupporting it againſt the belly, commonly give relief. If the inflammation has ariſen from a venereal cauſe, part of the fluid ought frequently to be injected, by means of a ſyringe, between the prepuce and glans, ſo as to waſh off any matter which may there be concealed ; but if the inflammation ſtill continues to increaſe, blood-letting is neceſſary, both general and local. The veins of the penis are ſometimes adviſed to be opened with a lancet ; but this is unſafe on account of the nerves. Leeches may be applied ; but care muſt be taken, in venereal caſes, left the bites of theſe animals, by abſorbing venereal matter, turn into chancres. Along with the remedies already adviſed, gentle lexatives, low diet, and abſtinence, ought to be preſcribed. But if, after a due perſeverance in theſe means, it is found that they have had little effect in removing the diſorder, or perhaps that the ſymptoms are conſtantly increaſing, and that chancres are confined under the prepuce ; in that caſe it is neceſſary to slit open the prepuce, which is beſt done by a ſharp-pointed biſtoury, concealed in a grooved directory, fig. 98. This is to be introduced between the prepuce and glands, till the director is found by the finger to have reached the upper or back part of the prepuce. The operator is now to keep the director firm with one hand, while with the other he puſhes forward the knife, till its point paſſes through the prepuce ; then drawing the inſtrument towards him, he cuts the prepuce through its whole length.</p><p>The operation being performed, the parts are to be wasted and cleaned with warm water, and the sore dressed with a little ſoft lint, and a compreſs of linen laid over it. The whole may be retained by a ſmall bag properly adapted, and ſecured by two ſtraps to a bandage put round the body. This bag may be left open at the under end, to allow the patient to make water, without removing the dreſſings ; but if this be found impracticable, the dreſſings may be removed with little inconvenience.
