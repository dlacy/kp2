N. of Manila. Pop. (1903) 14,919. In 1903, after the census had been taken, San IIdefonso (pop. 5326) was annexed to San Miguel. It has a cool and very healthy climate, and commands a beautiful view of the surrounding country. The soil is very fertile, and many of the inhabitants have acquired much wealth from the cultivation of rice. Sugar-cane, Indian corn and cotton are also produced in abundance, and cattle arc raised. Near the town are iron mines and quarries of limestone, and on the neighbouring mountains are forests containing valuable hardwood timber. About 8 m. N.E. are the medicinal springs of Sibul, to which large numbers of patients from the neighbouring provinces come. The San Miguel river, which flows near, affords a means of transportation, and the town has considerable commerce. Some beautiful furniture is made out of the hardwood from the mountains, and cotton fabrics are woven in considerable quantities by the women. The principal language is Tagalog. The chief buildings were destroyed in 1901 in a fire started by a band of thieves.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
