<p><span class="font0">within, and reſted on a ſtrong projection on the ιnfide. Small ſhot was gradually poured in upon the floors, ſo as&nbsp;to ſpread uniformly over them. The plain joiſted floor&nbsp;broke down with 487 pounds, and the carcaſe floor&nbsp;with 327. The firſt broke without giving any warning ; the other gave a violent crack when 294 pounds&nbsp;had been poured in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A trial had been made before, and the loads were 341 and 482. But the modelshaving been made by a&nbsp;leſs accurate hand, it was not thought a fair ſpecimen&nbsp;of the ſtrength which might be given to a carcaſe&nbsp;floor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The only argument of weight which we can recollect in favour of the compound conſtruction of roofs is, that the plain method would prodigiouſly increaſe the&nbsp;quantity of work, would admit nothing but long timber, which would greatly add to the expence, and&nbsp;would make the garrets a mere thicket of planks. We&nbsp;admit this in its full force ; but we continue to be of&nbsp;the opinion that plain roofs are greatly ſuperior in point&nbsp;of ſtrength, and therefore ſhould be adopted in caſes&nbsp;where the great difficulty is to inſure this neceſſary circumſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It would appear very neglectful to omit an account of the roofs put on round buildings, ſuch as domes, cupolas, and the like. They appear to be the moſt&nbsp;difficult taſks in the carpenter art. But the difficulty&nbsp;lies entirely in the mode of framing, or what the French&nbsp;call the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">trait de charpenterie.</span><span class="font0"> The view whiςh we&nbsp;are taking of the ſubject, as a part of mechanical ſei-ence, has little connection with this. It is plain, that&nbsp;whatever form of a truſs is excellent tn a ſquare building muſt be equally ſo as one of the frames of a round&nbsp;one; and the only difficulty is how to manage their mutual interſections at the top. Some ot them muſt be&nbsp;diſcontinued before they reach that length, and common&nbsp;ſenſe will teach us to cut them ſhort alternately, and always leave as many, that they may ſtand equally thick&nbsp;as at their firſt ſpringing from the bale of the dome.&nbsp;Thus the length of the purlins which reach from truſs&nbsp;to truſs will never be too great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The truth is, that a round building which gathers in at top, like a glaſs-houſe, a potter’s kiln, or a ſpire&nbsp;ſteeple, inſtead of being the moſt difficult to erect with&nbsp;liability, is of all others the eaſieſt. Nothing can ſhow&nbsp;this more forcibly than daily practice, where they are&nbsp;run up without centres and without ſcaffoldings ; and it&nbsp;requires groſs blunders indeed in the choice of their outline to put them is much danger of falling from a want&nbsp;of equilibrium. In like manner, a dome of carpentry&nbsp;can hardly fall, give it what ſhape or what conſtruction&nbsp;you will. It </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cannot</span><span class="font0"> fall unlèfs ſome part of it flies out&nbsp;at the bottom : an iron hoop round it, or ſtraps at the&nbsp;joinings of the truffes and purlins, which make an equivalent to a hoop, will effectually ſecure it. And as&nbsp;beauty requires that a dome ſhall ſpring almoſt perpendicularly from the wall, it is evident that there is hardly any thruſt to force out the walls. The only part&nbsp;where this is to be guarded againſt is, where the tangent is inclined about 40 or 50 degrees to the horizon.&nbsp;Here it will be proper to make a courſe of firm horizontal joinings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We doubt not but that domes βf carpentry will now be raiſed of great extent. The Halle du Bles at Paris, of 200 .feet in diameter, was.the invention of an intelligent </span><span class="font1">carpenter, </span><span class="font0">the Sieur Moulιneau. He was not&nbsp;by any means a man of ſcience, but had much more mechanical knowledge than artiſans uſually have, and was&nbsp;convinced that a very thin ſhell of timber might not only&nbsp;be ſo ſhaped as to be nearly in equilibrio, but that if hooped or firmly connected horizontally, it would have all&nbsp;the ſtiffneſs that was neceſſary ; and he preſented his&nbsp;project to the magiſtracy of Paris. The grandeur of it&nbsp;pleaſed them, but they doubted of its poffibility. Being a great public work, they prevailed on the Academy of Sciences to conſider it. The members, who&nbsp;were competent judges, were inſtantly ſtruck with the&nbsp;juſtneſs of Mr Moulineau’s principles, and aſtoniſhed&nbsp;that a thing ſo plain had not been long familiar to every houſe-carpenter. It quickly became an univerſal topic of converſation, diipute, and cabal, in the polite&nbsp;circles of Paris. But the Academy having given </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">very favourable report of their opinion, the project was&nbsp;immediately carried into execution, and ſoon completed, and now ſtands as one of the great exhibitions of&nbsp;Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The conſtruction of this dome is the ſimpleſt thing that can be imagined. The circular ribs which com-poſe it conſiſt of planks nine feet long, 13 inches broad,&nbsp;and three inches thick ; and each rib conſiſts of three of&nbsp;theſe planks bolted together in ſuch a manner that two-joints meet. A rib is begun, for inſtance, with a plank&nbsp;of three feet long ſtanding between one of fix feet and'&nbsp;another of nine, and this is continued to the head of it.&nbsp;No machinery was neceſſary for carrying up ſuch ſmall.&nbsp;pieces, and the whole went up like a piece of bricklayer’s work. At various diſtances theſe ribs were con-nected horizontally by purlins and iron ſtraps, which&nbsp;made ſo many hoops to the whole. When the works&nbsp;had reached ſuch a height, that the diſtance of the ribs&nbsp;was two-thirds of the original diſtance, every third rib&nbsp;was diſcontinued, and the ſpace was left open and glazed. When carried ſe&gt; much higher that the diſtance&nbsp;of the ribs is one-third, of the original diſtance, every&nbsp;ſecond rib (now conliſting of tw<sup>r</sup>o ribs very near each&nbsp;other) is in like manner diſcontinued, and the void is&nbsp;glazed. A little above this the heads of the ribs are&nbsp;framed into a circular ring of timber, which forms a&nbsp;wide opening in the middle ; over which is a glazed canopy or umbrella, with an opening between it and the&nbsp;dome for allowing the heated air to get out. All who&nbsp;have ſeen this dome ſay, that it is the moſt beautiful and&nbsp;magnificent object they have ever beheld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The only difficulty which occurs in the conſtruction of wooden domes is, when they are unequally loaded,&nbsp;by caιτying a heavy lanthern or cupola in the.middle.&nbsp;In ſuch a caſe, if the dome were a mere ſhell, it would&nbsp;be cruſhed in at the trop, or the action of the wind on&nbsp;the lanthern might tear it out of its place. Such a&nbsp;dome mult therefore conſiſt of trailed frames. Mr&nbsp;Price has given a very good one in his plate OP, tho’&nbsp;much ſtronger in the truffes than there was any oc-cafion for. This cauſes a great loſs of room, and&nbsp;throw's the lights of the lanthern too far up. It is evidently copied from Sir Chriſtopher Wren’s dome of&nbsp;St Paul’s church in London ; a model of propriety in&nbsp;its particular ſituation, but by no means a general model of a wooden dome. It reſts on the. brick cone&nbsp;within it ; and Sir Chriſtopher has very ingeniouſly&nbsp;made uſe of it for ſtifſening this cone, as any intelligent</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
