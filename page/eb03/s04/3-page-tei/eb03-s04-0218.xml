            <p>It is to be remarked, that the condenſation is greateſt when 16<hi rend="superscript"
                    >1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> ounces of alcohol have been added to 20 of
                water, and the condenſation is 2633/91835, or nearly <hi rend="superscript"
                    >1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">30</hi>th of the computed denſity. Since the
                ſpecific gravity of alcohol is 0,825, it is evident that 16<hi rend="superscript"
                    >1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> ounces of alcohol and 20 ounces of water
                have equal bulks. So that the condenſation is greateſt when the ſubſtances are mixed
                in equal volumes ; and 18 gallons of alcohol mixed with 18 gallons of water will
                produce not 36 gallons of ſpirits, but 35 only.</p>
            <p>We may alſo obſerve, that this is the mixture to which our revenue-laws refer,
                declaring it to be <hi rend="italic">one to six</hi> or <hi rend="italic">one in
                    ſeven</hi> under proof, and to weigh 7 pounds 13 ounce per gallon. This
                proportion was probably ſelected as the moſt eaſily compoſed, viz. by mixing equal
                meaſures of water and of the ſtrongeſt ſpirit which the known proceſſes of
                diſtillation could produce. Its ſpecific gravity is 0,939 very nearly.</p>
            <p>We muſt conſider this elaborate examination oſ the mixture of water and alcohol as a
                ſtandard ſeries of experiments, to which appeal may always be made, whether for the
                purpoſes of ſcience or of trade. The regularity of the progreſſion is ſo great, that
                in the column which we have examined, viz. that for temperature 60⁰, the greateſt
                anomaly does not amount to one part in six thouſand. The form of the ſeries is alſo
                very judiciouſly choſen for the purpoſes of ſcience. It would perhaps have been more
                directly ſtereometrical had the proportions of the ingredients been ſtated in bulks,
                which are more immediately connected with denſity. But the author has aſſigned a
                very cogent reaſon for his choice, viz. that the proportion of bulks varies by a
                change of temperature, becauſe the water and ſpirits follow different laws in their
                expanſion by heat.</p>
            <p>This is a proper opportunity for taking notice of a miſtake which is very generally
                made in the conduirons drawn from experiments of this kind. Equal additions of the
                ſpirit or water produce a ſeries of ſpecific gravities, which decreaſe or increaſe
                by differences continually diminiſhing. Hence it is inferred that there is a
                contraction of bulk. Even Dr Lewis, one of our</p>
            <p>moſt accompliſhed naturaliſts, advances this poſition, in a diſſertation on the
                pot-aſh of America ; and it considerably affects his method for eſtimating the
                ſtrength of the pot-aſh leys. Rut that it is a miſtake, appears plainly from this,
                that although we add for ever equal quantities of the ſpirits, we ſhall never
                produce a mix<hi rend="italic">ture</hi> which has as ſmall a ſpecific gravity as
                alcohol. Therefore the ſeries of ſucceſſive gravities muſt approximate to this
                without end, like the ordinates of a hyperbolic curve referred to its
                aſſymptote.</p>
            <p>That this may appear in the moſt general terms, let <hi rend="italic">w</hi>
                repreſent the weight of the confiant quantity of water in the mixture, and let <hi
                    rend="italic">a</hi> be the weight of the ſmall addition oſ ſpirits. Alſo let
                    <hi rend="italic">w</hi> repreſent the bulk of this quantity of water, and <hi
                    rend="italic">b</hi> the bulk of the ſmall addition of alcohol. The weight of
                the mixture is <hi rend="italic">w +a, </hi>and its bulk is <hi rend="italic">w +
                    b,</hi> and its ſpecific gravity is w + a/ w +b</p>
            <p>If we now add a ſecond equal quantity of ſpirits, the weight will be w<hi
                    rend="smallcaps"> + 2a, a</hi>nd if the ſpirit retains its denſity unchanged,
                the bulk will be w+2b, and the ſpecific</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic"> w+2a</hi></p>
            <p> gravity is w + 2b and after any number <hi rend="italic">m</hi> of ſuch</p>
            <p>equal additions of ſpirits, the ſpecific gravity will be w + ma</p>
            <p>Divide the numerator of this fraction by its</p>
            <p>denominator, and the quotient or ſpecific gravity will <hi rend="italic">m×
                a—b</hi></p>
            <p>be 1 + w + mb. This conſiſts of the conſtant part 1,</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">m (a — b)</hi></p>
            <p>and the variable part. We need attend only</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">w + mb. </hi></p>
            <p>to this part. If its denominator were conſtant, it is plain that the ſucceſſive
                ſpecific gravities would have</p>
            <p>equal differences, each being = becauſe <hi rend="italic">m</hi>
            </p>
            <p>w + mb,</p>
            <p>increaſes by the continual addition of an unit, and <hi rend="italic">a — b </hi>is a
                conſtant quantity. But the denominator <hi rend="italic">w + mb </hi>continually
                increaſes, and therefore the value of the </p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">a—b</hi></p>
            <p>fraction continually diminiſhes.</p>
            <p>Therefore the gradual diminution of the increments or decrements of ſpecific gravity,
                by equal additions of one ingredient to a conſtant meaſure of the other, is not of
                itſelf an indication of a change of denſity of either of the ingredients ; nor
                proves that in very diluted mixtines a greater proportion of one ingredient is
                abſorbed or lodged in the interſtices of the other, as is generally imagined. This
                muſt be aſcertained by comparing each ſpecific gravity with the gravity expreſſed by
                1 + w+ <hi rend="italic">m (a—b)</hi></p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">w + mb</hi></p>
