It is the centre of the great coal-mining district in the country and the seat of a large number of iron and steel works, rolling-mills, blastfurnaces, &amp;amp;c., and extensive factories for the production of</p><pb xml:id="eb09-21-s02-0552" facs="encyclopediabrit21newyrich_raw_0578.jp2"/><p>rails, locomotives, mining machinery, steam-boilers, stoves, carriages, edge-tools, &amp;amp;c. A public library, a theatre, an academy of music, a hospital, a public hall, a driving park, a Roman Catholic cathedral, a home for the friendless, and a museum of Indian stone relics are among the more prominent features of the place. The population was 9223 in 1860, 35,092 in 1870, and 45,850 in 1880.</p><p>Slocum Farm, as the site was called subsequent to 1798, saw its first blast-furnace erected in 1840 by George and Selden Scranton, who soon added a rolling-mill and the manufacture of rails. The opening of the railway in 1856 gave a great stimulus to the new town (1854), which obtained a city charter in 1866. It is divided into twenty-one wards, of which the 4th, 5th, 6th, 14th, 15th, and 18th are known as Hyde Fark, the 1st, 2d, and 3d as Providence.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
