a parish, seaport, and chief town in the island of Lewis, Scotland. The town is situated on a point of land at the head of Loch Stornoway, and was originally placed there by James VI. and erected by him into a borough of barony, in order to act as a means of civilization for the Western Islands. The harbour is capacious and of good depth, and the shipping belonging to the port is much more extensive than could be supposed for a place so remote and uninviting. The town consists of several streets of well- built slated houses, having numerous shops. Its public buildings are a neat and commodious custom-house, a town-house, a parish church, an assembly-room, and two school-houses. The town is a fishing station, and a large proportion of the inhabitants are therefore employed in the white and herring fisheries. The resident feuars and burgesses elect the town council and magistrates, consisting of two bailies and six councillors. The revenue of the borough is very small. The gross custom-house receipts collected here in 1838 amounted to L.519.2s. 4d. The population of the parish in 1821 amounted to 4119, and in 1831 to 5422. The increase of the population is ascribed to the gradual improvement of the parish, but more particularly to the erection of new stations or villages for the purpose of improving the soil and prosecuting the fisheries.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
