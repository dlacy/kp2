<p><span class="font1">period, of the existence of such a portrait.” While in England, Rubens very narrowly escaped drowning while&nbsp;going to Greenwich in a boat. The fact is reported by&nbsp;Lord Dorchester in a letter to Sir Isaac Wake (Sainsbury,&nbsp;cxvi.). At the beginning of March the painter’s mission&nbsp;came to a close.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rubens was now fifty-three years of age ; he had been four years a widower, and before the end of the year&nbsp;(December 1630) he entered into a second marriage with&nbsp;the beautiful girl of sixteen, named Helena Fourment,&nbsp;with whom his pictures have made the world so well acquainted. More than twenty portraits of her are described&nbsp;by Smith, and she also figures in perhaps twice as many&nbsp;of the master’s creations. Whether Rubens was more&nbsp;powerfully led in the choice of his second wife by her personal beauty or by the strength of a certain resemblance&nbsp;to his feminine ideal is questionable. Anyhow, she was&nbsp;an admirable model, and none of her husband’s works may&nbsp;be more justly termed masterpieces than those in which&nbsp;she is represented (Munich, St Petersburg, Blenheim,&nbsp;Liechtenstein, the Louvre, &amp;c.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although the long months of absence could not be termed blanks in Rubens’s artistic career, his return was&nbsp;followed by an almost incredible activity. Inspired more&nbsp;than ever by the glorious works of Titian, he now produced some of his best creations. Brightness in colouring,&nbsp;breadth of touch and pictorial conception, are specially&nbsp;striking in those works we know to have been painted in&nbsp;the latter part of his lifetime. Could anything give a&nbsp;higher degree of Rubens’s genius than, for example, the&nbsp;Feast of Venus, the portrait of Helena Fourment ready to&nbsp;enter the bath, or the St Ildefonso. This last picture—&nbsp;now, as well as the two others just alluded to, in the Vienna&nbsp;Gallery—was painted for the church of the convent of St&nbsp;Jacques, in Brussels. On the wings are represented the&nbsp;archdukes in royal attire, under the protection of their&nbsp;patron saints. The presence of these figures has led to&nbsp;some mistake regarding the date of the production, but it&nbsp;has been proved beyond doubt, through a document published by Mr Castan (1884), that the St Ildefonso belongs&nbsp;to the series of works executed after the journeys to&nbsp;Spain and England. Archduke Albert had been dead ten&nbsp;years. The picture was engraved by Witdoeck in 1638.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Isabella died in 1633, and we know that to the end Rubens remained in high favour with her, alike as an&nbsp;artist and as a political agent. The painter was even one&nbsp;of the gentlemen she deputed to meet Mary de’ Medici at&nbsp;the frontier in 1631, after her escape from France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Spain and the Netherlands went to war again, the king never ceasing to look upon the Dutch as rebels. The subject need not be dwelt upon ; suffice it to say that much&nbsp;useless trouble and suspicion came upon the great artist.&nbsp;As to the real nature of his communings with Frederick&nbsp;Henry of Orange, whom he is known to have interviewed,&nbsp;nothing as yet has been discovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ferdinand of Austria, the cardinal-infant of Spain, was called to the government of the Netherlands on the death&nbsp;of his aunt. He was the king’s younger brother, and&nbsp;arrived at Antwerp in May 1635. The streets had been&nbsp;decorated with triumphal arches and “ spectacula,” arranged&nbsp;by Rubens, and certainly never equalled by any other&nbsp;works of the kind.@@<sup>1</sup> Several of the paintings detached&nbsp;from the arches were offered as presents to the new&nbsp;governor-general, a scarcely known fact, which accounts&nbsp;for the presence of many of these works in public galleries&nbsp;(Vienna, Dresden, Brussels, &amp;c.). Rubens was at the time&nbsp;laid up with gout, but Prince Ferdinand was desirous of&nbsp;expressing his satisfaction, and called upon the painter,&nbsp;remaining a long time at his house. Rubens and Ferdinand&nbsp;had met at Madrid, and only a short time elapsed before&nbsp;the painter was confirmed in his official standing,—a matter&nbsp;of small importance, if we consider that the last years of&nbsp;his life were almost exclusively employed in working&nbsp;much more for the king than for his brother. About a&nbsp;hundred and twenty paintings of considerable size left&nbsp;Antwerp for Madrid in 1637, 1638, and 1639; they were&nbsp;intended to decorate the pavilion erected at the Pardo,&nbsp;and known under the name of Torre de la Parada.&nbsp;Another series had been begun, when Ferdinand wrote to&nbsp;Madrid that the painter was no more, and Jordaens would&nbsp;finish the work. Rubens breathed his last on the 30th of&nbsp;May 1640.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">More fortunate than many artists, Rubens left the world in the midst of his glory. Not the remotest trace of approaching old&nbsp;age, not the slighest failing of mind or skill, can be detected even&nbsp;in his latest works, such as the Martyrdom of St Peter at Cologne,&nbsp;the Martyrdom of St Thomas at Prague, or the Judgment of Paris&nbsp;at Madrid, where his young wife appears for the last time. “She&nbsp;is the handsomest person in Antwerp,” writes Ferdinand to his&nbsp;brother, in announcing the completion of what he terms ‘ ‘ the&nbsp;best painting Rubens has done. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If Rubens was something of a diplomatist, it cannot be denied that alike in body as in mind he is portrayed in his own works with&nbsp;the utmost straightforwardness. His productions are what they&nbsp;are, as if they could not have been otherwise, and the fact is that,&nbsp;in reply to any observations he may happen to receive, we constantly find him asserting the necessities of his subjects, thus&nbsp;confirming a remark made by Sir Joshua Reynolds that his subjects&nbsp;always seem to suit his style.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens is so well known that it hardly seems necessary to dwell upon his outward appearance. From his own letters and those&nbsp;in which he is referred to we become acquainted w<sup>τ</sup>ith a man of&nbsp;vast erudition, great good sense, dignity, and kindness, none more&nbsp;worthy of being called a gentleman ; and Sir Dudley Carleton, we&nbsp;know, termed him not only the prince of painters but of gentlemen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Those with whom he dealt in questions of learning proclaim his artistic excellence to be second only to his other qualifications,&nbsp;and even such critics as Winckelmann, who are least likely to&nbsp;sympathize with his style, do homage to his superior genius.&nbsp;“ Rubens,” he writes to Count Cobenzl, “is the glory of art, of his&nbsp;school, of his country, and of all coming centuries ; the fertility of&nbsp;his imagination cannot be overrated ; he is correct in his design,&nbsp;magnificent in his drapery ; and he must be looked upon as the&nbsp;great model for chiaroscuro, although in this branch he may be&nbsp;termed fanciful, but he has not sacrificed to the goddesses of&nbsp;beauty (TToræ) and the Graces.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens, indeed, although his type of feminine beauty is generally most pleasing, has little of the Italian grace and refinement, but&nbsp;then he was a Fleming throughout, notwithstanding his frequent&nbsp;recollections of those Italian masters whom he most admired, and&nbsp;who themselves have little, if anything, in common with Raphael.&nbsp;But it must be borne in mind how completely his predecessors were&nbsp;frozen into stiffness through Italianization, and how necessary it was&nbsp;to bring back the Flemish school to life and nature. Critics have&nbsp;spoken of Rubens’s historical improprieties. Of course nobody could&nbsp;suppose that his classical learning did not go far enough to know&nbsp;that the heroines of the Old Testament or of Roman history were&nbsp;not dressed out as ladies of his time ; but in this respect he only&nbsp;follows the example of Titian, PaulVeronese, and many others. In&nbsp;no other school do we find these animated hunts of lions, tigers, and&nbsp;even the hippopotamus and the crocodile, which may be reckoned&nbsp;among the finest specimens of art, and here again are life and&nbsp;nature displayed with the utmost power. “His horses are perfect&nbsp;in their kind,” says Reynolds ; his dogs are of the strong Flemish&nbsp;breed, and his landscapes the most charming pictures of Braban-tine scenery, in the midst of which lay his seat of Steen. As a&nbsp;portrait painter, although less refined than Van Dyck, he show<sup>r</sup>s&nbsp;that eminent master the way, and his pure fancy subjects, as the&nbsp;Garden of Love (Madrid and Dresden) and the Village Feast&nbsp;(Louvre), have never been equalled. As Mrs Jameson so justly</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">_ remarks, “ Rubens is the most popular because the most intelligible</span></p>
