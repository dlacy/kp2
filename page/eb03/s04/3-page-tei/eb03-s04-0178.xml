He diſinherited his sister, and eſtabliſhed the rights of his daughter. A furious civil war deſolated the kingdom. The names of Joan and Iſabella reſounded from every quarter, and were everywhere the ſummons to arms. But peace was at length brought about. Henry was reconciled to his ſiſter and Ferdinand ; though it does not appear that he ever renewed Iſabella’s right to the ſucceſſion : for he affirmed in his laſt moments, that he believed Joan to be his own daughter. The queen ſwore to the ſame effect ; and Henry left a teſtamentary deed, tranſmitting the crown to this princeſs, who was proclaimed queen of Caſtile at Placentia. But the ſuperior fortune and ſuperior arms of Ferdinand and Iſabella prevailed : the king of Portugal was obliged to abandon his niece and intended bride, after many ineffectual ſtruggles, and ſeveral years of war. Joan retired into a convent ; and the death of Ferdinand’s father, which happened about this time, added the kingdoms of Arragon and Sicily to thoſe of Leon and Caſtile.</p><p>Ferdinand and Iſabella were perſons of great prudence, and, as Sovereigns, highly worthy of imitation: but they do not ſeem to have merited all the praiſes beſtowed upon them by the Spaniſh hiſtorians. They did not live like man and wife, having all things in common under the direction of the husband ; but like two princes in cloſe alliance ; they neither loved nor hated each other ; were ſeldom in company together ; had each a ſeparate council; and were frequently jealous of one another in the adminiſtration. But they were inſeparably united in their common intereſts ; always acting upon the same principles, and forwarding the ſame ends. Their firſt object was the regulation of their government, which the civil wars had thrown into the greateſt diſorder. Rapine, outrage, and murder, were become ſo common, as not only to interrupt commerce, but in a great meaſure to ſuſpend all intercourſe between one place and another. Theſe evils the joint ſovereigns ſuppreſſed by their wiſe policy, at the ſame time that they extended the royal prerogative.</p><p>About the middle of the 13th century, the cities in the kingdom of Arragon, and after their example thoſe in Caſtile, had formed themſelves into an association, diſtinguiſhed by the name of the <hi rend="italic">Holy Brotherhood. </hi>They exacted a certain contribution from each of the aſſociated towns ; they levied a conſiderable body of troops, in order to protect travellers and purſue criminals ; and they appointed judges, who opened courts in various parts of the kingdom. Whoever was guilty of murder, robbery, or any act that violated the public peace, and was ſeized by the troops of the Brotherhood, was carried before their judges ; who, without paying any regard to the exclusive juriſdiction which the lord of the place might claim, who was generally the author or abettor of the injuſtice, tried and condemned the criminals. The nobles often murmured againſt this ſalutary institution ; they complained of it as an encroachment on one of their moſt valuable privileges, and endeavoured to get it aboliſhed. But Ferdinand and Iſabella, ſenſible of the beneficial effects of the Brotherhood, not only in regard to the police of their kingdom, but in its tendency to abridge, and by de</p><p>grees annihilate, the territorial juriſdiction oſ the nobility, countenanccd the inſtitution upon every occaſion, and ſupported it with the whole force of royal authority ; by which means the prompt and impartial adminiſtration of juſtice was reſtored, and with it tranquillity and order returned.</p><p>But at the ſame time that their Catholic majeſties (for ſuch was the title they now bore) were giving vigour to their civil government, and ſecuring their ſubjects ſrom violence and oppression, an intemperate zeal led them to eſtabliſh an eccleſiaſtical tribunal, equally contrary to the natural rights of humanity and the mild ſpirit of the goſpel. This was the court of inquiſition; which decides upon the honour, fortune, and even the line, of the unhappy wretch who happens to fall under the ſuſpicion of hereſy, or a contempt of any thing preſcribed by the church, without his knowing, being confronted with his accusers, or permitted either defence or appeal. Six thouſand perſons were burnt by order of this ſanguinary tribunal within four years after the appointment of Torquemada, the firſt inquiſitor-general ; and upwards of 100,000 felt its fury. The ſame furious and blinded zeal which led to the depopulation of Spain, led also to its aggrandizement.</p><p>The kingdom of Granada now alone remained of all the Mahometan poſſeſſions in Spain. Princes equally zealous and ambitious were naturally diſpoſed to turn their eyes to that fertile territory, and to think of increaſing their hereditary dominions, by expelling the enemies of Chriſtianity, and extending its doctrines. Everything conſpired to favour their project : the Mooriſh kingdom was a prey to civil wars ; when Ferdinand, having obtained the bull of Sixtus IV. authorizing a cruſade, put himſelf at the head of his troops, and entered Granada. He continued the war with rapid ſucceſs: Isabella attended him in ſeveral expeditions ; and they were both in great danger at the ſiege of Malaga ; an important city, which was defended with great courage, and taken in 1487. Baza was reduced in 1489, alter the loss of 20,000 men. Guadix and Almeria were delivered up to them by the Mooriſh king Alzagel, who had firſt dethroned his brother Alboacen, and afterwards been chafed from his capital by his nephew Abdali. That prince engaged in the ſervice of Ferdinand and Iſabella ; who, after reducing every other place of eminence, undertook the ſiege of Granada. Abdali made a gallant defence ; but all communication with the country being cut off, and all hopes of relief at an end, he capitulated, after a ſiege of eight months, on condition that he ſhould enjoy the revenue of certain places in the fertile mountains of Alpujarros; that the inhabitants ſhould retain the undisturbed poſſeſſion of their houſes, goods, and inheritances; the uſe of their laws, and the free exerciſe of their religion. Thus ended the empire of the Arabs in Spain, after it had continued about 800 years. They introduced the arts and ſciences into Europe at a time when it was loſt in darkneſs ; they poſſeſſed many of the luxuries of life, when' they were not even known among the neighbouring nations ; and they ſeem to have given birth to that romantic gallantry which ſo eminently prevailed in the ages of chivalry, and which, blending itſelf with the veneration of the northern nations for the ſofter sex, ſtill particularly diſtinguiſhes ancient from modern man-</p></body></text></TEI>
