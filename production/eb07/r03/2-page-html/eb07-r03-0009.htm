<p><span class="font0">and by no means worthy of his pen. There were found in his portfolio his Confessions, in twelve books; the first&nbsp;six of which were published. “ His Confessions,” says Sen-nebier, in his Literary History of Geneva, “ appear to&nbsp;me to be a very dangerous book, and paint Rousseau in&nbsp;such colours as we would never have ventured to apply&nbsp;to him. The excellent analyses which we meet with of&nbsp;some sentiments, and the delicate anatomy which he makes&nbsp;of some actions, are not sufficient to counterbalance the&nbsp;detestable matter which is found in them, and the unceasing obloquies everywhere to be met with.” Amongst his&nbsp;other posthumous pieces are the following. 1. The Reveries of a Solitary Wanderer, being a journal of the latter&nbsp;part of his life.@@<sup>1</sup> 2. Considerations upon the Government&nbsp;of Poland. 3. The Adventures of Lord Edward, a novel,&nbsp;being a kind of supplement to the new Heloisa. 4. Various Memoirs and Fugitive Pieces, with a great number&nbsp;of letters, containing some eloquent passages and deep&nbsp;thoughts. 5. Emilia and Sophia. 6. The Levite of Ephraim,&nbsp;a poem in prose, in four cantos, written in a style of ancient simplicity. 7. Letters to Sara. 8. An Opera and a&nbsp;Comedy. 9. Translations of the first book of Tacitus’s&nbsp;History, of the Episode of Olinda and Sophronia, from&nbsp;Tasso, &amp;c. Like all the other writings of Rousseau, we&nbsp;find in these posthumous pieces many admirable and some&nbsp;useful things; but they also abound with contradictions,&nbsp;paradoxes, and ideas very unfavourable to religion. In his&nbsp;letters, especially, we see a man chagrined at misfortunes&nbsp;which he never attributes to himself; suspicious of every&nbsp;body about him, calling and believing himself a lamb in the&nbsp;midst of wolves. Viewing him solely as a writer, his character is perhaps described with truth and accuracy in the&nbsp;following words of Mr Hume. “ Though I see some tincture of extravagance in all his writings, I also think I see&nbsp;so much eloquence and force of imagination, such an energy of expression, and such a boldness of conception, as entitle him to a place amongst the first writers of his age.”&nbsp;His works, in the best edition, published in 1788 and the&nbsp;following years, extend to thirty-seven volumes octavo.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROWE, Nicholas, was descended of an ancient family in Devonshire, and born in 1673. He acquired a complete&nbsp;taste for the classical authors under Dr Busby in Westminster school; but poetry was his early and darling study.&nbsp;His father, who was a lawyer, entered him a student in the&nbsp;Middle Temple, and he made remarkable advances in the&nbsp;study of the law ; but the love of the belles lettres, and of&nbsp;poetry, stopped him in his career. His first tragedy, the&nbsp;Ambitious Stepmother, meeting with universal applause, he&nbsp;laid aside all thoughts of rising by the law, and afterwards&nbsp;composed several tragedies; but that which he valued himself most upon was his Tamerlane. The others were, the&nbsp;Fair Penitent, Ulysses, the Royal Convert, Jane Shore, and&nbsp;Lady Jane Grey. He also wrote a poem called the Biter,&nbsp;and several poems upon different subjects, which have been&nbsp;published under the title of Miscellaneous Works, in one&nbsp;volume, as his dramatic works have been in two. Rowe is&nbsp;chiefly to be considered in the light of a tragic writer and&nbsp;a translator. In his attempt at comedy, he failed so igno-miniously that his Biter is not inserted in his works ; and&nbsp;his occasional poems and short compositions are rarely worthy either of praise or censure, for they seem to be the&nbsp;casual sports of a mind seeking rather to amuse its leisure&nbsp;than to exercise its powers. In the construction of his&nbsp;dramas there is not much art; and he is not a nice observer&nbsp;of the unities. I know not, says Dr Johnson, that there&nbsp;can be found in his plays any deep search into nature, any&nbsp;accurate discrimination of kindred qualities, or nice display&nbsp;of passion in its progress. All is general and undefined.&nbsp;Nor does he much interest or affect the auditor, except in&nbsp;Jane Shore, who is always seen and heard with pity. Alicia&nbsp;is a character of empty noise, with no resemblance to real&nbsp;sorrow or to natural madness. Whence then has Rowe acquired his reputation? From the reasonableness and propriety of some of his scenes, from the elegance of his diction, and from the suavity of his verse. He seldom moves&nbsp;either pity or terror, but he often elevates the sentiment;&nbsp;he seldom pierces the breast, but he always delights the&nbsp;ear, and often improves the understanding. Being a great&nbsp;admirer of Shakspeare, he gave the public an edition of his&nbsp;plays, to which he prefixed an account of his life. But the&nbsp;most considerable of Mr Rowe’s performances was a translation of Lucan’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pharsalia,</span><span class="font0"> which he just lived to finish,&nbsp;but not to publish; for it did not appear in print till 1728,&nbsp;ten years after his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the meanwhile, the love of poetry and books did not make him unfit for business; for nobody applied closer to it&nbsp;when occasion required. The Duke of Queensberry, when&nbsp;secretary of state, made him secretary for public affairs. But&nbsp;after the duke’s death, all avenues to his preferment were&nbsp;stopped; and during the remainder of Queen Anne’s reign&nbsp;he passed his time with the Muses and his books. On the&nbsp;accession of George I., however, he was made poet-laureat,&nbsp;and one of the land-surveyors of the customs in the port&nbsp;of London. The Prince of Wales conferred on him the&nbsp;clerkship of his council; and the Lord Chancellor Parker&nbsp;made him his secretary for the presentations. But he did&nbsp;not enjoy these promotions long ; for he died on the 6th of&nbsp;December 1718, being then in his forty-fifth year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Rowe, who was twice married, had a son by his first wife, and a daughter by his second. He was a very hand-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> In this he confesses that he liked better to send his children into hospitals destined for orphans, than to take upon himself the charge of their maintenance and education, and endeavours to palliate this offence, which nothing can exculpate.</span></p>
