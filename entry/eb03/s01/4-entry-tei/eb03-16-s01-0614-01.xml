(Claudius), a French writer of uncommon abilities and immenſe erudition, descended from an ancient and noble family, and born at or near Semur in 1596. His mother, who was a Proteſtant, infused her notions of religion into him, and he at length converted his father: he ſettled at Leyden; and in 1650 paid a viſit to Chriſtina queen of Sweden, who is reported to have ſhown him extraordinary marks of regard. Upon the violent death of Charles I. of England, he was prevailed on by the royal family, then in exile, to write a defence of that king; which was anſwered by our famous Milton in 1651, in a work intitled <hi rend="italic">Deſenfio pro Populo Anglicano contra Claudii Salmafii Defenſionem Regiam.</hi> This book was read over all Europe; and conveyed ſuch a proof of the writer’s abilities, that he was reſpected even by thoſe who hated his principles. Salmaſius died in 1653; and ſome did not ſcruple to ſay, that Milton killed him by the acuteneſs of his reply. His works are numerous, and of various kinds; but the greateſt monuments of his learning are, his <hi rend="italic">Notre in Hiſtoriae Auguſtae Scriptores,</hi> and his <hi rend="italic">Exercitationes Plinianae in Solinum.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
