        <p><span class="font3">From the Curia a flight&nbsp;of steps led&nbsp;down to the Co-mitium
                (Liv.,&nbsp;i. 36), the level&nbsp;of which appears from the existing steps and
                pavement near the arch of&nbsp;Severus (see Plate VII.) to have been about 2 feet
                below that of&nbsp;the Forum, and not above it, as Bunsen and others have
                asserted.&nbsp;On the Comitium stood the ancient rostra till they were
                rebuilt&nbsp;on a new site by Julius Cæsar in 44 B.c. The ancient rostra
                were&nbsp;so called in 338 b.c., when Camillus and Mcenius defeated the&nbsp;Latin
                fleet at Antium, and the beaks (rostra) of the captured&nbsp;ships were fixed to an
                existing platform on the Comitium for&nbsp;orators. It was also called a “templum”
                because the structure&nbsp;was consecrated by the augurs (Cic., </span><span
                class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">De Orat.,</span><span class="font3"> iii.
                3). Other&nbsp;rostra, named for distinction Rostra Julia, were so called
                from&nbsp;the beaks of ships taken at Actium and affixed by Augustus to
                the&nbsp;podium of the temple built by him in honour of the deified
                Julius.&nbsp;Both are mentioned by Suetonius </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">(Aug.,</span><span class="font3"> 100). There were
                several&nbsp;other platforms or tribunals for orators in and about the
                Forum,&nbsp;but they were not called rostra. From the original rostra
                Cicero&nbsp;delivered his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Second</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">Third Catiline Orations,</span><span class="font3"> and
                they were the&nbsp;scene of some of the most important political struggles of
                Rome,&nbsp;such as the enunciation of their laws by the Gracchi. Beside
                the&nbsp;Comitium another monument was erected, also adorned with beaks&nbsp;of
                ships, to commemorate the same victory at Antium. This was&nbsp;the Columna Mœnia,
                so called in honour of Mcenius (Plin., </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">H.N.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">xxxiv. 11, vii.
                60). The Columna Duilia was a similar monument,&nbsp;erected in honour of the
                victory of C. Duilius over the Punic fleet&nbsp;in 260 B. c. ; a fragment of it with
                inscription (restored in imperial&nbsp;times) is preserved in the Capitoline
                    Museum.<sup>l</sup> Columns such as&nbsp;these were called “columnæ
                rostratæ.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">Near the Comitium, on the side towards the Capitol, was the
                Græcostasis, a platform where foreign ambassadors stood to hear&nbsp;the speeches
                (see Varro, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">loc.
                    eit.<sup>y</sup>).</span><span class="font3"> It appears probable that,
                like&nbsp;the rostra, the Græcostasis was moved in the 1st century b.c. ;&nbsp;and
                this name has been given with some probability to the curved&nbsp;marble-faced
                platform behind the existing rostra.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">The Senaculum appears to have been a place of preliminary meeting for
                the Senate before entering the Curia (Liv., xli. 27 ;&nbsp;Val. Max., ii. 2, 6) ; it
                adjoined the temple of Concord, and when&nbsp;this was rebuilt on an enlarged scale
                in the reign of Augustus it&nbsp;appears probable that its large projecting portico
                became the&nbsp;Senaculum (Dionys., i. 34, vi. 1). It may possibly have once
                been&nbsp;identical with the Area Concordhe mentioned by Livy (xl. 19)
                in&nbsp;connexion with the Area Vulcani (comp, xxxix. 46).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">A great part of the north-east side of the Foram was occupied by a.
                two basilicæ, which were more than once rebuilt under different&nbsp;names. The
                first of these appears to have been adjacent to the&nbsp;Curia, on its south side ;
                it was called the Basilica Porcia, and was&nbsp;founded by the elder Cato in 184
                b.c. (see Liv., xxxix. 44, and&nbsp;Plut., </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">Cato Major,</span><span class="font3"> 19); it was burnt
                with the Curia at Clodius’s&nbsp;funeral. Adjoining it another basilica, called
                Æmilia et Fulvia&nbsp;(A arro, vi. 4), was built in 176 b.c. by the censors M.
                Fulvius&nbsp;and M. Æmilius Lepidus;@@<sup>2</sup> it stood, according to Livy (xl.
                51),</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">“post argentarias novas,” the line of silversmiths’ shops along the
                north-east side of the Forum. In 50 b.c. it was rebuilt by L.&nbsp;Æmilius Paulus
                (Plut., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cæs.,</span><span
                class="font3"> 29; Appian, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Bell. Civ.,</span><span class="font3"> ii. 26), and&nbsp;was more than once
                restored within the few subsequent years by&nbsp;members of the same family. Its
                later name was the Basilica&nbsp;Pauli, and it was remarkable for its magnificent
                columns of&nbsp;Phrygian marble (Plin., </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">H.N.,</span><span class="font3"> xxxvi. 24) or
                pavonazetto.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">Near the middle of the north-east side of the Forum stood also Ί the
                small bronze temple of Janus,@@<sup>3</sup> the doors of which were shut c&nbsp;on
                those rare occasions when Rome was at peace.@@<sup>4</sup> A first brass
                of&nbsp;Nero shows it as a small cella, with richly ornamented frieze
                and&nbsp;cornice. Another ædicula near that of Janus was the shrine of&nbsp;Venus
                Cloacina (or the Purifier), probably on the line of the great&nbsp;cloaca (Liv.,
                iii. 48; Plin., </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"
                >H.N.,</span><span class="font3"> xv. 36). Two or more other&nbsp;shrines of Janus
                stood on this side, behind the shops of the money-lending argentarii ; and the word
                “Janus” was used to imply the&nbsp;place ofusurers (Hor., </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">Sat.,</span><span class="font3"> ii. 3, 18).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">So far the buildings mentioned have been mostly those whose sites are
                still buried under the line of modern houses on the northeast of the Forum, the only
                part which has not yet been excavated.&nbsp;Turning to those of which existing
                remains are visible, at the&nbsp;north-west end the rostra of Julius Cæsar mark the
                limit of the&nbsp;Forum in this direction, as the arch of Fabius beside the
                temple&nbsp;of Faustina did in the other.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">Plate VII. shows the plan of the rostra, with the curved Græcostasis
                1 behind it. It is an oblong platform about 78 feet long and 11 feet ι&nbsp;high
                above the level of the Forum ; its ground floor, paved with&nbsp;herring-bone
                bricks, is 2 feet 6 inches below the Forum paving.&nbsp;Its end and side walls are
                of tufa blocks, 2 feet thick and 2 feet&nbsp;wide, each carefully clamped to the
                next with wooden dovetail&nbsp;dowels. Its floor was supported by a series of
                travertine piers,&nbsp;carrying travertine lintels, on which the floor slabs rested
                (see&nbsp;fig. 13). Outside it was completely lined with Greek marble and&nbsp;had a
                richly moulded plinth and cornice ; none of the latter is </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;situ,</span><span class="font3"> but
            many</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">pieces lie scattered around. A groove cut in&nbsp;the top of
                the&nbsp;cornice shows&nbsp;the place where&nbsp;marble cancelli&nbsp;were fixed ;
                one&nbsp;of the cornice&nbsp;blocks is partly&nbsp;without this&nbsp;groove,
                showing&nbsp;that the screen&nbsp;did not extend&nbsp;along the whole&nbsp;front of
                the rostra. This agrees&nbsp;with a relief on&nbsp;the arch of Constantine,
                representing the emperor making an&nbsp;oration from the&nbsp;rostra, with
                other&nbsp;buildings at this&nbsp;end of the Forum&nbsp;shown behind.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">In this relief the screen is shown</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">with a break in the middle, so that the orator, standing in tho
                centre, was visible from head to foot. Two tiers of large holes to&nbsp;hold the
                bronze rostra are drilled right through the tufa wall, and&nbsp;even through the
                travertine pilasters where one happens to come&nbsp;in the way ; these holes show
                that there were nineteen rostra in&nbsp;the lower tier, and twenty above set over
                the intermediate spaces&nbsp;of the lower row. The back -wall of the rostra is of
                concrete faced&nbsp;with brick, which, being probably the work of Julius Cæsar in
                44&nbsp;b.c., is the earliest dated example of brickwork in Rome. The&nbsp;inside
                space, under the main floor of the rostra, is coated thickly&nbsp;with stucco,—the
                brick wall being studded in the usual way with&nbsp;iron nails to form a key for the
                plaster.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">In spite of the assertions of Bunsen, Jordan, and others that the
                    <sup>ι </sup>curved platform behind (conjecturally called the Græcostasis) is
                a&nbsp;work of late date, it is evident from various constructional
                points,&nbsp;visible at the junction of the two structures, that it existed
                before&nbsp;the rostra, which when built completely hid its rich lining and
                the&nbsp;pilasters of porta santa marble which decorated its front,—very
                strong&nbsp;evidence as to the curved platform being earlier in date. The
