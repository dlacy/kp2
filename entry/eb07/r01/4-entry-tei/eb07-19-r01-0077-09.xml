a celebrated lake in the mountains of Thibet, on the north of the great Himalayah range. It is the source of the river Sutulege, and is connected with the lake Mansarowar. The lake is long and narrow, and is divided by an island. It derives its supplies from several small rivers that flow from the mountains, and also from the melting of the snows. The situation is about the thirty-first degree of north latitude, and near it may be seen Mount Cailas, a well-known scene of Hindu fable, covered with perpetual snow.</p>
