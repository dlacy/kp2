<p><span class="font0">La Cortona with a small following, and began to raise the so-called “ army of the faith ” in association with Fra Diavolo and other brigand leaders. Ruffo had no difficulty in upsetting&nbsp;the republican government established by the French, and&nbsp;by June had advanced to Naples (see Naples and Nelson).&nbsp;The campaign has given rise to much controversy. Ruffo&nbsp;appears to have lost favour with the king by showing a tendency&nbsp;to spare the republicans. He resigned his vicar-generalship&nbsp;to the prince of Cassero, and during the second French conquest&nbsp;and the reigns of Joseph Bonaparte and Murat he lived quietly&nbsp;in Naples. Some notice was taken of him by Napoleon, but&nbsp;he never held an important post. After the restoration of&nbsp;the Bourbons he was received into favour. During the revolutionary troubles of 1822 he was consulted by the king, and was&nbsp;even in office for a very short time as a “ loyalist ” minister.&nbsp;He died on the 13th of December 1827.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The account of Ruffo given in Colletta’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Naples</span><span class="font0"> (English translation, Edinburgh, i860) must be taken with caution. Colletta&nbsp;was a violent liberal partisan, who wrote in exile, and largely from&nbsp;memory. He has been corrected by the Duca de Lauria, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Intorno&nbsp;alia storia del Reame di Napoli di Pietro Colletta</span><span class="font0"> (Naples, 1877).&nbsp;Ruffo’s own side of the question is stated in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memorie Storiche sulla&nbsp;vita del Cardinale Fabrizto Ruffo,</span><span class="font0"> by Domenico Sacchinelli (Naples,&nbsp;1836).

<p><span class="font0">RUFIJI, a large river of German East Africa, entering the sea by a considerable delta, between 7<sup>0</sup> 45' and 8° 13' S. Its&nbsp;upper basin, which extends from N. to S. through over 300 m.,&nbsp;is drained by three main branches, which unite to form the&nbsp;lower Rufiji. Of the three upper branches, the two southern,&nbsp;the Luvegu and the Ulanga, though shorter than the northernmost (the Ruaha), carry a greater volume of water, as they&nbsp;come from a more rainy region, and by their junction in 8° 35'&nbsp;S., 37° 25' E., the Rufiji proper may be said to be formed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Luvegu rises io° 50' S., 35° 50' E., and flows N.E. in a wooded valley, generally narrow, and bordered by a broken country in&nbsp;great part uninhabited and covered with thin forest. In its lower&nbsp;course it is a large stream—100 to 150 yds. wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Ulanga is formed by a number of streams descending from the outer escarpment of the high plateau which runs N.E. from the&nbsp;head of Lake Nyasa and in Uhehe becomes broken up in ranges&nbsp;of mountains. The most important head-stream, the Ruhudye,&nbsp;rises in about 9<sup>0</sup> 30' S., 34° 40' E. As a whole, the Ulanga valley&nbsp;is broad, level and swampy, the river running in a very winding&nbsp;course and sending off many diverging arms. It is, navigable&nbsp;throughout the greater part of its course, having even in the dry&nbsp;season a general depth of 3 to 12 ft., with a width of 40 to 120 yds.&nbsp;In April and May nearly all the streams overflow their banks and&nbsp;cover a great part of the plain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Just below the junction of the Luvegu and Ulanga, the Rufiji flows through a narrow pass by the Snuguli falls, and continues</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">N.E. in a fairly straight course to the junction of the Ruaha, in 7° 55' S., 37° 52' E. The. most remote branches of the Ruaha rise&nbsp;N. of Lake Nyasa in the Livingstone mountains. The united stream&nbsp;makes a wide sweep to the N. of the Uhehe mountains, from which&nbsp;it receives various tributaries, finally flowing S.E. and E. to the&nbsp;Rufiji. . A little below the junction the Rufiji is broken by the&nbsp;Pangani falls, but is thence navigable by small steamers to its&nbsp;delta. In this part of its course the river receives no large tributaries&nbsp;but sends out divergent channels. The country on either side is a&nbsp;generally level plain, inundated, on the south, in the rains, and the&nbsp;river varies in width from 100 to 400 yds., with an average current&nbsp;of 3 m. an hour. The main mouth of the river is that known as&nbsp;Simba Uranga, the bar of which can be crossed by ocean vessels&nbsp;at high water, but all the branches are very shallow as the apex&nbsp;of the delta is approached. Much of the delta is suited for ricegrowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUFINUS, TYRANNIUS, presbyter and theologian, was bom at or near Aquileia at the head of the Adriatic, probably between 340 an 345. In early manhood he entered the cloister&nbsp;as a catechumen, receiving baptism about 370. About the&nbsp;same time a visit of Jerome to Aquileia led to a close friendship&nbsp;between the two, and shortly after Jerome’s departure for&nbsp;the East Rufinus also was drawn thither (in 372 or 373) by his&nbsp;interest in its theology and monasticism. He first settled in&nbsp;Egypt, hearing the lectures of Didymus, the Origenistic head&nbsp;of the catechetical school at Alexandria, and also cultivating&nbsp;friendly relations with Macarius the elder and other ascetics&nbsp;in the desert. In Egypt, if not even before leaving Italy, he&nbsp;had become intimately acquainted with Melania, a wealthy and&nbsp;devout Roman widow; and when she removed to Palestine,&nbsp;taking with her a number of clergy and monks on whom the&nbsp;persecutions of the Arian Valens had borne heavily, Rufinus&nbsp;(about 378) followed her. While his patroness lived in a convent of her own in Jerusalem, Rufinus, at her expense, gathered&nbsp;together a number of monks in a monastery on the Mount of&nbsp;Olives, devoting himself at the same time to the study of Greek&nbsp;theology. This combination of the contemplative life and&nbsp;the life of learning had already developed in the Egyptian&nbsp;monasteries. When Jerome came to Bethlehem in 386,&nbsp;the friendship formed at Aquileia was renewed. Another&nbsp;of the intimates of Rufinus* was John, bishop of Jerusalem,&nbsp;and formerly a Nitrian monk, by whom he was ordained to&nbsp;the priesthood in 390. In 394, in consequence of the attack&nbsp;upon the doctrines of Origen made by Epiphanius of Salamis&nbsp;during a visit to Jerusalem, a fierce quarrel broke out, which&nbsp;found Rufinus and Jerome on different sides; and, though three&nbsp;years afterwards a formal reconciliation was brought about&nbsp;between Jerome and John, the breach between Jerome and&nbsp;Rufinus remained unhealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the autumn of 397 Rufinus embarked for Rome, where, finding that the theological controversies of the East were&nbsp;exciting much interest and curiosity, he published a Latin&nbsp;translation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apology</span><span class="font0"> of Pamphilus for Origen, and also&nbsp;(398-99) a somewhat free rendering of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">7repl apx&amp;v</span><span class="font0"> (or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Principiis)</span><span class="font0"> of that author himself. In the preface to the&nbsp;latter work he referred to Jerome as an admirer of Origen,&nbsp;and as having already translated some of his works with&nbsp;modifications of ambiguous doctrinal expressions. This allusion annoyed Jerome, who was exceedingly sensitive as to his&nbsp;reputation for orthodoxy, and the consequence was a bitter&nbsp;pamphlet war, very wonderful to the modern onlooker, who&nbsp;finds it difficult to see anything discreditable in the accusation&nbsp;against a biblical scholar that he had once thought well of&nbsp;Origen, or in the countercharge against a translator that he&nbsp;had avowedly exercised editorial functions as well. At the&nbsp;instigation of Theophilus of Alexandria, Anastasius (pope 398-402) summoned Rufinus from Aquileia to Rome to vindicate&nbsp;his orthodoxy; but he excused himself from a personal attendance in a written </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apologia pro fide sua.</span><span class="font0"> The pope in his reply&nbsp;expressly condemned Origen, but left the question of Rufinus’s&nbsp;orthodoxy to his own conscience. He was, however, regarded&nbsp;with suspicion in orthodox circles (cf. the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Decrttum Gelassii,</span><span class="font0"> § 20)&nbsp;in spite of his services to Christian literature. In 408 we find&nbsp;Rufinus at the monastery of Pinetum (in the Campagna?);&nbsp;thence he was driven by the arrival of Alaric to Sicily, being&nbsp;accompanied by Melania in his flight. In Sicily he was engaged&nbsp;in translating the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Homilies</span><span class="font0"> of Origen when he died in 410.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The original works of Rufinus are—(1) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Adulteratione Librorum Origenis</span><span class="font0">—an appendix to his translation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apology</span><span class="font0"> of Pamphilus,&nbsp;and intended to show that many of the features in Origen’s teaching&nbsp;which were then held to be objectionable arise from interpolations&nbsp;and falsifications of the genuine text; (2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Benedictiombus XII&nbsp;Patriarcharum Libri II</span><span class="font0">—an exposition of Gen. xlix.; (3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apologia&nbsp;s.

The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Historiae Ecclesiasticae Libri XI</span><span class="font0"> of Rufinus&nbsp;consist partly of a free translation of Eusebius (10 books in 9) and&nbsp;partly of a continuation (bks. x. and xi.) down to the death of Theodosius the Great. The other translations of Rufinus are—(1) the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Instituta Monachorum</span><span class="font0"> and some of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Homilies of</span><span class="font0"> Basil; (2) the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apology</span><span class="font0"> of Pamphilus, referred to above; (3) Origen's </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Principia;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(4) </span><span class="font0">Origen*s</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Homilies</span><span class="font0"> (Gen.-Kings,also Cant, and Rom.) ;($) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Opuscula&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Gregory of Nazianzus; (6) tne </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sententiae</span><span class="font0"> of Sixtus, an unknown&nbsp;Greek philosopher; (7) the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sententiae</span><span class="font0"> of Evagrius; (8) the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Clementine&nbsp;Recognitions</span><span class="font0"> (the only form in which that work is now extant);&nbsp;(9) tne </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Canon Paschatis</span><span class="font0"> of Anatolius Alexandrinus.
