It abounds alſo with the camphire trees, which conſtitute the common timber in uſe ; and in theſe trees the camphire is found native, in a concrete form. It is remarkable, that in this ſtate it is ſold to the Chineſe at the price of 250l. or 300 l, <hi rend="italic">per</hi> cwt. but theſe dexterous artiſts contrive to furniſh the Europeans with it at about a quarter of that price. In 1783, Mr Marſden, who had been ſecretary to the preſident and council of Fort Marlborough, publiſhed a Hiſtory of Sumatra, with very copious particulars of the iſland. He repreſents it as ſurpaſſed by few in the beautiful indulgences of nature. A chain of high mountains runs through its whole extent ; the ranges in many parts being double and treble ; their altitude, though great, is not ſufficient to occaſion their being covered with ſnow during any part of the year. Between theſe ridges are extenſive plains, conſiderably elevated above the ſurface of the maritime lands. In theſe the air is cool ; and from this advantage they are eſteemed the moſt eligible portion of the country, are the best inhabited, and the moſt cleared from woods, which elſewhere, in general, throughout Sumatra, cover both hills and valleys with an eternal ſhade. Here too are found many large and beautiful lakes, that facilitate much the communication between the different parts. The heat of the ait is far from being ſo intenſe as might be expected from a country occupying the middle of the Torrid Zone ; and it is more temperate than many regions within the Tropics; the thermometer at the most ſultry hour, about two in the afternoon, generally fluctuating between 82 and 85 degrees. Mr Marſden divides the inhabitants into Malays, Acheneſe, Battas, Lampoons, and Rejangs ; and he takes the latter as his standard of deſcription, with reſpect to the perſons, manners, and customs, of the inhabitants. They are rather below the middle stature ; their bulk in proportion ; their limbs for the moil part flight, but well ſhaped, and particularly ſmall at the wrists and ancles ; and, upon the whole, they are gracefully formed. Their hair is ſtrong, and of a ſhining black. The men are beard- lefs, great pains being taken to render them ſo when boys, by rubbing their chins with a kind of quicklime. Their complexion is properly yellow, wanting the red tinge that conſtitutes a copper or tawny colour. They are in general lighter than the Mestees, or half-breed, of the reft of India; thoſe of the ſuperior claſs, who are not expoſed to the rays of the ſun, and particularly their women of rank, approaching to a degree of fairneſs. If beauty consisted in this one quality, ſome of them would ſurpass our brunettes in Europe. The major part of the females are ugly, many of them even to diſgust ; yet among them are ſome whoſe appearance is ſtrikingly beautiful, whatever composition of perſon, features, and complexion, that ſentiment may be the reſult of. Some of the inhabitants of the hilly parts are obſerved to have the ſwelled neck or goitre ; but they attempt no remedy for it, as theſe wens are conſistent with the higheſt health. The rites of marriage among the Sumatrans consist simply in joining the hands of the parties, and pronouncing them man and wife without much ceremony, excepting the entertainment which is given upon the occaſion by the father of the girl. The cuſtoms of the Sumatrans permit their having as many wives as they can pur- chaſe, or afford to maintain ; but it is extremely rare that an mſtance occurs of their having more than one, and that only among a tew of the chiefs. This continence they owe, in ſome meaſure, to their poverty. The dictates of frugality arc more powerful with them than the irregular calls of appetite, and make them decline an indulgence from which their law does not reſtrain them. Mothers carry their children, not on the arm as our nurſes do, but straddling on the hip, and uſually ſupported by a cloth which ties in a knot on the oppoſite ſhoulder. The children are nurſed but little ; are not confined by any ſwathing or bandages ; and being suffered to roll ab ut the floor, ſoon learn to walk and shift for themſelves. When cradles are uſed, they ſwing ſuſpended from the ceilings of the rooms.</p><p>The Sumatrans are ſo fond of cock-fighting, that a father on his death bed has been known to deſire his ion to take the firſt opportunity of matching a cock for a ſum equal to his whole property, under a blind conviction of its being invulnerable. When a cock is killed, or runs, the other must have ſufficient ſpirit and vigour left to peck at him three times on his being held up to him for that purpoſe, or it becomes a drawn battle ; and ſometimes an experienced cocker will place the head of his vanquished bird in ſuch an uncouth ſituation as to terrify the other, and. render him unable to give this proof of victory.</p><p>The wild beaſts of Sumatra are tgers, elephants, rhinoceroſes, bears, and monkeys. The tigers prove to the inhabitants both in their journeys and even their domeſtic occupations most deſtructive enemies. The number of people annually slain by theſe rapacious tyrants of the woods is al- moſt incredible. Whole villages have been depopulated by them ; yet from a ſuperſtitious prejudice, it is with difficulty they are prevailed upon, by a large reward which the India Company offers, to uſe methods of deſtroying them, till they have ſuſtained ſome particular injury in their own family or kindred. The ſize and strength of the ſpecies which prevails on this iſland is prodigious. They are ſaid to break with a ſtroke of their fore paw the leg of a horſe or a buffalo ; and the largeſt prey they kill is without difficulty dragged by them into the woods. This they uſually perform on the second night, being ſuppoſed on the firſt to gratify themſelves with fucking the blood only. Time is by this delay afforded to prepare for their deſtruc- tion, either by ſhooting them, or placing a veſſel of water ſtrongly impregnated with arſenic near the carcaſe, which is faſtened to a tree to prevent its being carried off. The tiger having ſatiated himſelf with the fleſh, is prompted to aſſuage his thirſt with the tempting liquor at hand, and pe- riſhes in the indulgence. Their chief ſubſiſtence is moſt probably the unfortunate monkeys with which the woods abound. They are described as alluring them to their fate by a faſcinating power, ſimilar to what has been ſuppoſed of the ſnake ; and, ſays Mr Marſden, “ I am not incredulous enough to treat the idea with contempt, having myſelf obſerved, that when an alligator or a crocodile, in a river, comes under an overhanging branch of a tree, the monkeys, in a ſtate of alarm and diffraction, crowd to the extremity, and, chattering and trembling, approach nearer and nearer to the amphibious monſter that waits to devour them as they drop, which their fright and number render almoſt unavoidable.” Theſe alligators likewise occaſion the loſs of many inhabitants, frequently deſtroying the people as they bathe in the river, according to their regular cuſtom, and which the perpetual evidence of the riſk attending it cannot deter them from. A ſuperſtitious idea of their ſanctity alſo preſerves them from moleſtation, although, with a hook of ſufficient strength, they may be taken without much difficulty. The other animals of Sumatra are buffaloes, a ſmall kind of horſes, goats, hogs, deer, bullocks, and hog-deer. This laſt is an animal ſomewhat larger than a rabbit, the head reſembling that of a hog, and its ſhanks and feet like thoſe of the deer. The bezoar ſtone found on this animal has been valued at 10 times its weight in gold ; it is of a dark brown colour, ſmooth on the outſide ; and the coat being taken off, it appears ſtill darker, with ſtrings running underneath the coat ; it will ſwim on the top of the water.
