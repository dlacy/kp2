<p><span class="font2">characterized by florid antithesis, expressed </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">short jerky sentences. But he has no definite place in the development of&nbsp;rhetoric as a system. It is doubtful whether he left a written&nbsp;“art”; and his mode of teaching was based on learning&nbsp;prepared passages by heart,—diction (Xefts), not invention or&nbsp;arrangement, being his great object.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The first extant Greek author who combined the theory with the practice of rhetoric is the Athenian Antiphon </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> the&nbsp;first of the Attic orators, and the earliest representative&nbsp;at Athens of a new profession created by the new&nbsp;art of rhetoric—that of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">\oyoypà&lt;j&gt;os,</span><span class="font2"> the writer of&nbsp;forensic speeches for other men to speak in court. His speeches&nbsp;show the art of rhetoric in its transition from the technical to&nbsp;the practical stage, from the school to the law court and the&nbsp;assembly. The organic lines of the rhetorical pleader’s thought&nbsp;stand out in bold relief, and we are enabled to form a clear&nbsp;notion of the logographer’s method. We find a striking illustration of the fact that the topic of “ probability ” is the staple&nbsp;of this early forensic rhetoric. View<sup>r</sup>Cd generally, the works of&nbsp;Antiphon arc of great interest for the history of Attic prose, as&nbsp;marking how far it had then been influenced by a theory of&nbsp;style. The movement of Antiphon’s prose has a certain grave&nbsp;dignity, “ impressing by its weight and grandeur,” as a Greek&nbsp;critic in the Augustan age says, “ not charming by its life and&nbsp;flow.” Verbal antithesis is used, not in a diffuse or florid&nbsp;way, but with a certain sledge-hammer force, as sometimes in&nbsp;the speeches of Thucydides. The imagery, too, though bold,&nbsp;is not florid. The structure of the periods is still crude; and&nbsp;the general effect of the whole, though often powerful and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">impressive, is somewhat rigid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Antiphon represents what was afterwards named the “ austere ” or “ rugged ” style </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(αυστηρά αρμονία),</span><span class="font2"> Lysias was the model&nbsp;of an artistic and versatile simplicity. But while Antiphon&nbsp;has a place in the history of rhetoric as an art, Lysias, with his&nbsp;more attractive gifts, belongs only to the history of oratory.&nbsp;Ancient writers quote an “ art ” of rhetoric by Isocrates, but&nbsp;its authenticity was questioned. It is certain, however, that&nbsp;Isocrates taught the art as such. He is said to have&nbsp;defined rhetoric “ as the science of persuasion ” (Sext.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Empir. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Adv. MathemSi.</span><span class="font2"> § 62, p. 301 seq.). Manyof his particular precepts, both on arrangement and on diction, are cited, but&nbsp;they do not give a complete view of his method. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">φιλοσοφία&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(“ theory of culture ”) which Isocrates expounds in his discourses&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Against the Sophists</span><span class="font2"> and on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Antidosis,</span><span class="font2"> was in fact rhetoric&nbsp;applied to politics. First came technical expositions : the&nbsp;pupil was introduced to all the artificial resources which prose&nbsp;composition employs (ràs fôéas </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">απασα$</span><span class="font2"> aîs‘ 6 Xoyos </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">τυγχάνει&nbsp;χρώμενος, Antid.</span><span class="font2"> § 183). The same term </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ίδεαι)</span><span class="font2"> is also used by&nbsp;Isocrates in a narrower sense, with reference to the “ figures ” of&nbsp;rhetoric, properly called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">σχήματα (Panath.</span><span class="font2"> § 2) ; sometimes, again,&nbsp;in a sense still more general, to the several branches or styles of&nbsp;literary composition </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Antid.</span><span class="font2"> § 11). When the technical elements&nbsp;of the subject had been learned, the pupil was required to apply&nbsp;abstract rules in actual composition, and his essay was revised&nbsp;by the master. Isocrates was unquestionably successful in&nbsp;forming speakers and writers. His school was famous during&nbsp;a period of some fifty years (390 to 340 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.).</span><span class="font2"> Among the&nbsp;statesmen whom it trained were Timotheus, Leodamas of&nbsp;Acharnae, Lycurgus and Hyperides; among the philosophers or&nbsp;rhetoricians were Speusippus, Plato’s successor in the Academy,&nbsp;and Isaeus; among the historians, Ephorus and Theopompus.&nbsp;Cicero and through him all subsequent oratory owed much to&nbsp;the ample prose of the Isocratean school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the person of Isocratcs the art of rhetoric is thus thoroughly established, not merely as a technical method, but also as a&nbsp;practical discipline of life. If Plato’s mildly ironical reference&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ezithydemus</span><span class="font2"> to a critic “on the borderland between&nbsp;philosophy and statesmanship ” was meant, as is probable, for&nbsp;Isocrates, at least there was a wide difference between the measure&nbsp;of acceptance accorded to the earlier Sophists, such as Protagoras,&nbsp;and the influence which the school of Isocrates exerted through&nbsp;the men whom it had trained. Rhetoric had won its place in&nbsp;education. It kept that place through varying fortunes to the&nbsp;fall of the Roman empire, and resumed it, for a while, at the&nbsp;revival of learning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Plato in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gorgias</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phaedrus</span><span class="font2"> satirized the ordinary textbooks of rhetoric, and himself gave directions for a higher&nbsp;standard of work; but the detailed study of the art&nbsp;begins with Aristotle. Aristotle’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font2"> belongs to&nbsp;the generation after Isocrates, having been composed&nbsp;(but see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aristotle)</span><span class="font2"> between 330 and 322 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c. As&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">controversial allusions sometimes hint it holds Isocrates for&nbsp;one of the foremost exponents of the subject. From a purely&nbsp;literary point of view Aristotle’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font2"> (with the partial&nbsp;exception of book iii.) is one of the driest works in the world.&nbsp;From the historical or scientific point of view it is one of the&nbsp;most interesting. If we would seize the true significance of the&nbsp;treatise it is better to compare rhetoric with grammar than&nbsp;with its obvious analogue, logic. A method of grammar was&nbsp;the conception of the Alexandrian age, which had lying before&nbsp;it the standard masterpieces of Greek literature, and deduced&nbsp;the “ rules ” of grammar from the actual practice of the best&nbsp;writers. Aristotle in the latter years of the 4th century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">held the same position relatively to the monuments of Greek&nbsp;oratory which the Alexandrian methodizers of grammar held&nbsp;relatively to Greek literature at large. Abundant material lay&nbsp;before him, illustrating how speakers </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">had</span><span class="font2"> been able to persuade&nbsp;the reason or to move the feelings. He therefore sought thence&nbsp;to deduce rules and so construct a true art. Aristotle’s practical&nbsp;purpose was undoubtedly real. If we are to make persuasive&nbsp;speakers, he believed, this is the only sound way to set about it.&nbsp;But the enduring interest of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font2"> is mainly retrospective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It attracts us as a feat in analysis by an acute mind—-a feat highly characteristic of that mind itself, and at the same time&nbsp;strikingly illustrative of the field over which the materials have&nbsp;been gathered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetoric</span><span class="font1"> is divided into three books. It deals in great detail with the minutiae of the rhetorical craft. Book i. discusses the&nbsp;nature and object of rhetoric. The means of persuasion ( Turrets)&nbsp;are classified into “ inartificial ” (ατ«χροι), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the facts of the case&nbsp;external to the art, documents, laws, depositions,—and “ artificial ” (2rr«xpot), the latter subdivided into logical (the popular&nbsp;syllogism or “ enthymeme,” the “ example,” &amp;c.), ethical, and&nbsp;.emotional. Aristotle next deals with the “ topics ” (τότοι), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the commonplaces of rhetoric, general or particular arguments&nbsp;which the rhetorician must have ready for immediate use. Rhetoric&nbsp;is then broadly divided into :—(1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">deliberative · (συμβουλευτική),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">concerned with exhortation or dissuasion, and with future time,&nbsp;its end (τίλο$) being the advantage or detriment of the persons&nbsp;addressed; (2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">forensic</span><span class="font1"> (δικανική), concerned with accusation and&nbsp;defence, and with time past, its standard being justice; (3) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">epi-Jeictic<sub>r</sub></span><span class="font1">  the ornamental rhetoric of display, concerned with praise&nbsp;and blame, usually with the present time, its standard being honour&nbsp;and shame. Each of these kinds is discussed, and the book ends&nbsp;with a brief analysis of the “ inartificial proofs.” In book ii.&nbsp;Aristotle returns to the “ artificial ” proofs—those which rhetoric&nbsp;itself provides. The “ logical ” proof having been discussed in&nbsp;book i.,.he turns to the “ethical.” He shows how the speaker&nbsp;may so indicate his own character and the goodness of his motive&nbsp;as to prepossess the audience in his favour, and proceeds to furnish&nbsp;materials to this end. The “ emotional ” proof is then discussed,&nbsp;and an analysis is given of the emotions on which the speaker may&nbsp;play. A consideration follows of the “ universal commonplaces ’’ .&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(κοινοί</span><span class="font1"> τόΐτοι) which are suitable to all subjects. The book ends&nbsp;with an appendix dealing with the “example” (παράδίίγρα), the&nbsp;general moral sentiments (γρώμαι) and the enthymeme. In book iii.&nbsp;Aristotle considers expression (λίξ«), including the art of delivery&nbsp;(ÙTTÔKptats), and arrangement (τάξ«). Composition, the use of&nbsp;prose rhythm, the periodic style (the “ periodic ” style, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">κατεστραμμένη,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">being contrasted with the “running” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(είρομενη))</span><span class="font1"> are all analysed,&nbsp;and the types of style literary (γραφική) and oral (άγωιαστική) are&nbsp;differentiated. Under “ arrangement ” he concludes with the&nbsp;parts of a speech, proem, narrative, proofs and epilogue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is necessary briefly to consider Aristotles general view of rhetoric as set forth in book i. Rhetoric is properly an art. This&nbsp;is the proposition from which Aristotle sets out. It is so because&nbsp;when a speaker persuades, it is possible </span><span class="font2">to </span><span class="font1">find out why he succeeds&nbsp;in doing so. Rhetoric is, in fact, the popular branch of logic.&nbsp;Hitherto, Aristotle says,, the essence of rhetoric has been neglected&nbsp;for the accidents. Writers on rhetoric have hitherto concerned&nbsp;themselves mainly with “ the exciting of prejudice, of pity, of&nbsp;anger, and such-like emotions of the soul.” All this is very well,&nbsp;but “ it has nothing to do with the matter in hand; it has regard</span></p>
