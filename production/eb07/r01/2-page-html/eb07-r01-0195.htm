<p><span class="font0">state of revolt ; when they overturn the government, and form a new one for themselves, they effect a revolution.&nbsp;That which is termed the revolution in Britain is the change&nbsp;which, in 1688, took place in consequence of the forced&nbsp;abdication of James H. when the Protestant succession&nbsp;was established, and the constitution restored to its primitive purity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Revolution, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geometry,</span><span class="font0"> the motion of rotation of a line about a fixed point or centre, or of any figure about a&nbsp;fixed axis, or upon any line or surface. Thus, the revolution of a given line about a fixed centre generates a circle ;&nbsp;and that of a right-angled triangle about one side, as an&nbsp;axis, generates a cone ; and that of a semicircle about its&nbsp;diameter generates a sphere or globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Revolution, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Astronomy,</span><span class="font0"> is the period of a star, planet, or comet, or its course from any point of its orbit,&nbsp;till it return to the same again.</span></p>

The suburbs are large.&nbsp;Under the fort runs the Bichanaddy, which has its source&nbsp;twenty miles to the east. It contains a good citadel, built&nbsp;of stone, and the country in the vicinity is well cultivated.&nbsp;Long. 81. 25. E. Lat 24. 27. N.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REYNEAU, Charles Rene, commonly known by the name of Father Reyneau, a celebrated mathematician of&nbsp;France, was born in the year 1656, at Brissac, in the province of Anjou. When twenty years of age, he connected himself with the Oratorians, a sort of religious order,&nbsp;the members of which lived in community without binding&nbsp;themselves to the observance of any vows, and turned their&nbsp;chief attention to the instruction of youth. He afterwards&nbsp;taught philosophy at Pezenos, and next at Toulon, which&nbsp;requiring some degree of geometrical knowledge, he became extremely fond of that science, and cultivated and&nbsp;improved it to a great extent. He was, in consequence of&nbsp;his knowledge, invited to fill the mathematical chair at&nbsp;Angers in 1683, and he was also elected a member of the&nbsp;academy in 1694.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He undertook to reduce into a body, for the benefit of his pupils, the chief theories which were scattered throughout the works of Newton, Descartes, Leibnitz, Bernoulli,&nbsp;the Leipsic Acts, the Memoirs of the Academy of Paris,&nbsp;and several other works, to which he gave the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Analyse Démontrée,</span><span class="font0"> or Analysis Demonstrated, and which&nbsp;was published in 1708, in two vols, quarto.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He gave to this work the name of Analysis Demonstrated, because he therein demonstrates various methods which had not been demonstrated by their authors, or, at least,&nbsp;not with sufficient accuracy and perspicuity. This work&nbsp;of Reyneau was very much applauded, and it became a&nbsp;general maxim in France, that to follow him was the best,&nbsp;if not the only way, to make any extraordinary progress in&nbsp;the study of mathematics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such was his ambition to be useful, that in 1714 he published his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Science du Calcul des Grandeurs,</span><span class="font0"> intended for the benefit of such as were wholly unacquainted with the&nbsp;science of geometry. Of this work a very able judge was&nbsp;pleased to observe, that “ though several books had already&nbsp;appeared upon the same subject, such a treatise as that before him was still wanting, as in it everything was handled&nbsp;in a manner sufficiently extensive, and at the same time&nbsp;with all possible exactness and perspicuity.” Although&nbsp;many branches of the mathematics had been well discussed&nbsp;prior to his time, no good elements were to be met with,&nbsp;even of practical geometry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris gave admission to other learned and eminent men, Father Rey-neau was received into the number. The works already mentioned are all he ever published, or perhaps ever composed, with the exception of a little piece upon logic ; and&nbsp;materials for a second volume of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Science du Calcul</span><span class="font0"> were&nbsp;left behind him in manuscript. Towards the close of life&nbsp;he was too much afflicted with sickness to give much application to study ; and he died in 1728, at seventy-two&nbsp;years of age. His many virtues and extensive erudition&nbsp;made this event much regretted by all who had the pleasure of being acquainted with him. It was regarded as&nbsp;an honour and a happiness by the first men in France to&nbsp;number him amongst their friends, such as the chancellor&nbsp;of the kingdom, and Malebranche, of the latter of whom&nbsp;Reyneau was a faithful and zealous disciple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REYNOLDS, Sir Joshua, the celebrated painter, was born at Plympton, a small town in Devonshire, on the&nbsp;16th July 1723. His father was minister of the parish, and&nbsp;also master of the grammar school ; and being a man of&nbsp;learning and philanthropy, he was beloved and respected&nbsp;by all to whom he was known. Such a man, it will naturally be supposed, was assiduous in the cultivation of the&nbsp;minds of his children, amongst whom his son Joshua shone&nbsp;conspicuous, by displaying at a very early period a superiority of genius and the rudiments of a correct taste.&nbsp;Unlike other boys, who generally content themselves with&nbsp;giving a literal explanation of their author, regardless of&nbsp;his beauties or his faults, young Reynolds attended to both&nbsp;these, displaying a happy knowledge of what he read, and&nbsp;entering with ardour into the spirit of his author. He discovered likewise talents for composition, and a natural propensity for drawing, in which his friends and intimates&nbsp;thought him qualified to excel. Emulation was a distinguishing feature in his mind, which his father perceived&nbsp;with the delight natural to a parent; and designing him&nbsp;for the church, in which he hoped that his talents might&nbsp;raise him to eminence, he sent him to one of the universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Soon after this period he grew passionately fond of painting; and, by the perusal of Richardson’s theory of that art was determined to make it his profession through'life.&nbsp;At his own earnest request therefore, he was removed to&nbsp;London ; and about the year 1742 became a pupil to Mr&nbsp;Hudson, who, though not himself an eminent painter, was&nbsp;preceptor to several who afterwards excelled in the art.&nbsp;One of the first advices which he gave to Mr Reynolds&nbsp;was to copy carefully Guercino’s drawings. This was done&nbsp;with such skill, that many of the copies are said to be now&nbsp;preserved in the cabinets of the curious as the originals of&nbsp;that very great master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About the year 1749, Mr Reynolds went to Italy under the auspices and in the company of Lord, then Commodore, Keppel, who was appointed to the command of the&nbsp;British squadron in the Mediterranean. In this garden of&nbsp;the world, this magical seat of the arts, he failed not to visit&nbsp;the schools of the great masters, to study the productions&nbsp;of different ages, and to contemplate with unwearied attention the various beauties which are characteristic of each.&nbsp;His labour here, as has been observed of another painter,&nbsp;was “ the labour of love, not the task of the hireling ;” and&nbsp;how much he profited by it is known to all Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having remained about two years in Italy, and studied the language as well as the arts of the country with great&nbsp;success, he returned to England, improved by travel and&nbsp;refined by education. On the road to London from the port&nbsp;where he landed, he accidentally found in the inn where he&nbsp;lodged Johnson’s life of Savage ; and was so taken with the&nbsp;charms of composition and the masterly delineation of character displayed in that performance, that having begun to&nbsp;read it whilst leaning with his arm on the chimney-piece,&nbsp;he continued in that attitude insensible of pain till he was&nbsp;hardly able to raise his hand to his head. The admiration</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
