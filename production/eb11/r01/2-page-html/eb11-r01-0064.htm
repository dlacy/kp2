<p><span class="font1">schedule of the hours during which the man or men are em-ployed as will bring those hours within limits which appear to the department reasonable. In the event of the company&nbsp;failing to comply with the demands of the department, the&nbsp;latter is empowered to refer the case to the Railway and Canal&nbsp;Commissioners, who form a special Court constituted by the&nbsp;Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1888, for deciding, among&nbsp;other things, questions relating to rates and charges, for protecting traders from undue charges and undue preference,&nbsp;for regulating questions of traffic, and for deciding certain&nbsp;disputes between railway companies and the public. The Commissioners are then empowered to deal with the matter, and if&nbsp;“ a railway company fail to comply with any order made by the&nbsp;Railway and Canal Commissioners, or to enforce the provisions&nbsp;of any schedule ” approved by them, it is liable to a fine of a&nbsp;hundred pounds for every day during which the default continues. This act has been the means of effecting a considerable&nbsp;reduction in the hours worked by railway men on certain railways, and no case has yet arisen in which a reference to the&nbsp;Commissioners has been necessary. Such modifications of the&nbsp;hours of work have not only been beneficial to the men, but&nbsp;have improved the discipline of the staff and the punctuality&nbsp;and regularity of the train service, particularly in respect of the&nbsp;goods trains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Notice of Accidents Act of 1884, which obliges employers of labour to report to the Board of Trade, when “there occurs in&nbsp;any employment ” as defined by the schedule of the act, “any&nbsp;accident which causes to any person employed therein, either loss&nbsp;of life or such bodily injury as to prevent him on any one of&nbsp;the three working days next after the occurrence of the accident&nbsp;from being employed for five hours on his ordinary work, ” affects&nbsp;railways in course of construction, but not, as a rule, otherwise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although the administration of the above-mentioned acts of parliament has had a beneficial effect upon the safety of the&nbsp;public, and has enabled an enormous volume of traffic&nbsp;to be handled with celerity, punctuality and absence&nbsp;of risk, it has during recent years come to notice that&nbsp;the number of casualties among railway servants is still unduly&nbsp;great, and in 1899 a Royal Commission was appointed to in-vestigate the causes of the numerous accidents, fatal and non-fatal, to railway men. As a consequence of the report of this&nbsp;Commission the Railway Employment (Prevention of Accidents)&nbsp;Act of 1900 was passed, putting upon the Board of Trade the&nbsp;duty of making “ such rules as they think fit with respect to any&nbsp;of the subjects mentioned in the schedule to this act, with the&nbsp;object of reducing or removing the dangers and risks incidental&nbsp;to railway service. ’’ Rules may also be made in respect to other&nbsp;matters besides those mentioned in the schedule, and companies&nbsp;may be called upon to adopt or reject, as the case may be, any&nbsp;appliance, the use or disuse of which may be considered desirable&nbsp;in the interest of the men. Before, however, the rules so made&nbsp;become binding upon the companies, the latter have the right&nbsp;of appealing against them to the Railway Commissioners.&nbsp;Failure to comply with any of the rules renders a company&nbsp;“ liable for each offence, on conviction under the Summary&nbsp;Jurisdiction Acts, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, or in the&nbsp;case of a continuing offence to a fine not exceeding ten pounds&nbsp;for every day during which the offence continues after con-viction. ” Rules drafted by the Board of Trade under this act&nbsp;came into force on the 8th of August 1902, the subjects referred&nbsp;to being (1) labelling of wagons; (2) movements of wagons by&nbsp;propping and tow-roping; (3) power-brakes on engines;&nbsp;(4) lighting of stations and sidings; (5) protection of points,&nbsp;rods, &amp;c.; (6) construction and protection of gauge-glasses;&nbsp;(7) arrangement of tool-boxes, &amp;c., on engines; (8) provision&nbsp;of brake-vans for trains upon running lines beyond the limits of&nbsp;stations; (9) protection to permanent-way men when relaying&nbsp;or repairing permanent way. The final settlement of a rule&nbsp;requiring brake-levers to be fitted on both sides of goods-wagons&nbsp;was, however, deferred, owing to objections raised by certain of</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Other acts which are of importance in connexion with accidents are the Accidents Compensation Act of 1846, the&nbsp;Employers’ Liability Act of 1880, and the Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1897.</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font0">The public acts of parliament referring to British railways are collected in Bigg’s General Railway Acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">American Railway Legislation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Before 1870. </span><span class="font1">—The earliest legislation is contained in charters granted by special act, for the construction of railways. These&nbsp;special acts gradually gave way to general statutes under&nbsp;which railway corporations could be created without application&nbsp;to the legislature. In the east, where, as a rule, charters had&nbsp;been uniform and consistent, the change to general incorporation law was due to a desire to render incorporations speedier&nbsp;and less expensive. In the west, general laws came rather as&nbsp;a result of the abuses of special legislation. By 1850, general&nbsp;incorporation laws were found in nearly all the eastern states,&nbsp;and by 1870 in those of the west.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Early legislation was confined almost entirely to matters of construction. In cases where statutes did touch the question&nbsp;of regulation, they had to do with the operation of trains and&nbsp;with the provision of facilities for shippers and passengers,&nbsp;rather than with questions of rates. It was natural that&nbsp;this should be so, for the new transportation agency was so&nbsp;much more efficient than anything previously available that&nbsp;the people were eager to take advantage of its superior service.&nbsp;As a rule, the making of rates was left to the corporations.&nbsp;If the maximum rates were prescribed, as they sometimes&nbsp;were, the limit was placed so high as to be of no practical value&nbsp;for control. Such crude attempts as were made to prevent&nbsp;rates from being excessive concerned themselves with profits,&nbsp;and were designed to confiscate for the state treasury any&nbsp;earnings beyond a certain prescribed dividend. Publicity of&nbsp;rates was not generally required, and provisions against discrimination were rare. In the period before 1850 there was&nbsp;but little realization of the public nature of the railway industry&nbsp;and of the possibilities of injury to the public if railway corporations were left uncontrolled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In regions where capital was lacking eagerness for railway facilities led the people to demand the direct co-operation of&nbsp;the state, and many projects, most of which ended in disaster,&nbsp;were undertaken either by the state itself or through the aid&nbsp;of the state’s credit. For example, Michigan, in 1837, in the&nbsp;first session of its state legislature, made plans for the construction of 557 miles of railway under the direct control of the&nbsp;state, and the governor was authorized to issue bonds for the&nbsp;purpose. The unfortunate results of this policy led many of the&nbsp;states, from about 1850, to put constitutional limitations upon&nbsp;the power of their legislatures to lend the state’s credit or to involve the state as stockholder in the affairs of any corporation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As railway building increased in response to traffic needs, and as the consolidation of short lines into continuous systems&nbsp;proceeded, legislation applicable to railways became somewhat&nbsp;broader in scope and more intelligent. About 1850 there&nbsp;began to appear on the statute books laws requiring publicity&nbsp;of rates and the submission of annual reports to the legislature,&nbsp;prescribing limits to corporate indebtedness, and also making&nbsp;provision for safety in operation and for the character and&nbsp;quality of railway service. Consolidation and leasing were&nbsp;commonly permitted in the case of continuous lines, but were&nbsp;regularly prohibited in the case of parallel and competing lines.&nbsp;The practice of pooling seems not to have attracted the attention&nbsp;of the legislature. In general it may be asserted that legis-lation of this period was ill-considered, haphazard, and on a&nbsp;petty scale. Moreover, it was of little practical importance&nbsp;even within its narrow range, for it does not appear to have&nbsp;been generally enforced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1870-1900. —</span><span class="font1">Railway legislation first assumed importance in connection with the “ Granger Movement ” in the middle&nbsp;west. There the policy of subsidies for railway building&nbsp;had been carried to a reckless extreme. Roads had been&nbsp;constructed in advance of settlement, and land-seekers had been</span></p>
