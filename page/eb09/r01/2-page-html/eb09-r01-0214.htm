<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">Such power must have been given him by the instrument creating the rent charge. The Statute of Uses, 27 Hen.&nbsp;VIII. c. 10, gave a power of distress for a rent charge&nbsp;created under the statute. The Conveyancing Act, 1881,&nbsp;44 &amp; 45 Viet. c. 41, § 44, now gives a power of distress&nbsp;for a sum due on any rent charge which is twenty-one&nbsp;days in arrear. By § 45 a power of redemption of certain&nbsp;perpetual rents in the nature of rent charges is given to&nbsp;the owner of the land out of which the rent issues. Rent&nbsp;charges granted since April 26, 1855, otherwise than by&nbsp;marriage settlement or will for a life or lives or for any&nbsp;estate determinable on a life or lives must, in order to&nbsp;bind lands against purchasers, mortgagees, or creditors,&nbsp;be registered in the central office of the Supreme Court&nbsp;(18 </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> 19 Viet. c. 15). In certain other cases it is also&nbsp;necessary to register rent charges, for instance, under the&nbsp;Improvement of Land Act, 1864, and the Land Transfer&nbsp;Act, 1875. Forms of rent charge of special interest are&nbsp;tithe rent charge (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Tithes), </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">ground rents, and the&nbsp;rent charges for the purpose of conferring votes usually&nbsp;called “ faggot votes.” Ground rents are rent charges in&nbsp;fee simple issuing out of land sold for building purposes.&nbsp;The lessee erects buildings according to the terms of the&nbsp;lease, making his profit by subletting either at a rack rent&nbsp;or on the terms of a fine on entrance into possession,&nbsp;with an annual rent slightly larger than the ground rent.&nbsp;In the latter case the rent is called an improved ground&nbsp;rent. Ground rents are regarded as particularly eligible&nbsp;investments owing to the extent of the security afforded.&nbsp;Rent charges of the annual value of 40s. for the purpose&nbsp;of creating votes are now rendered ineffective by the&nbsp;Representation of the People Act, 1884, 48 Viet. c. 3,&nbsp;§ 4, which enacts (subject to a saving for existing rights&nbsp;and an exception in favour of owners of tithe rent charge)&nbsp;that a man shall not be entitled to be registered as a voter&nbsp;in respect of the ownership of any rent charge. A rent&nbsp;seek </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">(redditus siccus)</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> is a rent charge reserved without&nbsp;power of distress. But, as power of distress for rent seek&nbsp;was given by 4 Geo. II. c. 28, the legal effect of such rent&nbsp;has been since the Act the same as that of a rent charge.&nbsp;There are varieties of these main divisions of rent to which&nbsp;special names are given. Rents of assize or quit rents&nbsp;are a relic of the old customary rents. They are presumed to have been established by usage, and cannot be&nbsp;increased or diminished. They are found only in manors.&nbsp;Those paid by the freeholders are also called chief rents.&nbsp;Fee farm rents are rents reserved on grants in fee. According to some authorities they must be at least one-fourth of&nbsp;the value of the lands. They, like quit rents, now occur&nbsp;only in manors, unless existing before the Statute of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Quia&nbsp;Emptores</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"> or created by the crown (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Real Estate).&nbsp;</span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">A rent which is equivalent or nearly equivalent in amount&nbsp;to the full annual value of the land is a rack rent. A&nbsp;dead rent is a fixed annual sum paid by a person working&nbsp;a mine or quarry, in addition to royalties varying according to the amount of minerals taken. Rents in kind still&nbsp;exist to a limited extent; thus the corporation of London&nbsp;is tenant of some lands in Shropshire by payment to the&nbsp;crown of an annual rent of a faggot. All pepper-corn or&nbsp;nominal rents seem to fall under this head. Services&nbsp;rendered in lieu of payment by tenants in grand and petit&nbsp;serjeanty may also be regarded as examples of rents in&nbsp;kind. Labour rents are represented by those cases, not&nbsp;unfrequent in agricultural leases, where the tenant is&nbsp;bound to render the landlord a certain amount of team&nbsp;work or other labour as a part of his rent. It was held&nbsp;in the Queen’s Bench in 1845 that tenants who occupied&nbsp;houses on the terms of sweeping the parish church and of&nbsp;ringing the church bell paid rent within the meaning of&nbsp;the Limitation Act of 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV., c. 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Apportionment.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—In regard to estate a rent service is apportion -able at common law, as well as under certain Acts of Parliament, such as the Land Clauses Act. A rent charge was formerly not&nbsp;apportionable, for it issued out of every part of the land and was&nbsp;at the same time in contemplation of law against common right as&nbsp;not being incident to tenure. The legal effect of this ■was that&nbsp;(with some exceptions) a release of part of the land out of which a&nbsp;rent charge issued was a release of the whole. It was provided by&nbsp;22 </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">k</span><span class="font4"> </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">23 Viet. c. 35, § 10, that the release from a rent charge of&nbsp;part of the hereditaments charged does not extinguish the whole&nbsp;rent charge, but operates only to bar the right to recover any part&nbsp;of the rent charge out of the hereditaments released. In regard to&nbsp;time, at common law no kind of rent was apportionable. The effect&nbsp;of this was that if the person entitled to the rent died between rent&nbsp;days no rent was due to the succeeding reversioner for the intermediate period. This was remedied by 11 Geo. II. c. 19, and other&nbsp;Acts, which are now practically superseded by the Apportionment&nbsp;Act, 1870, 33 &amp; 34 Viet. c. 35. By this Act all rents are, in the&nbsp;absence of stipulation to the contrary, to be considered as accruing&nbsp;from day to day, and apportionable in respect of time accordingly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Remedies.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—Rent is due in the morning of the day appointed for payment, but is not in arrear until after midnight. It should be&nbsp;demanded just before sunset. The landlord has besides distress his&nbsp;ordinary remedy by action. In addition special statutory remedies&nbsp;are given in the case of tenants holding over after the expiration&nbsp;of their tenancy. By 11 Geo. II. c. 19 any tenant giving notice&nbsp;to quit and holding over is liable to pay double rent for such time&nbsp;as he continues in possession. By 1 &amp; 2 Viet. c. 74 a tenant at a&nbsp;rent not exceeding £20 per annum who fails to deliver up possession&nbsp;after his interest has ended may be ejected by summary proceedings before justices. By 19 &amp; 20 Viet. c. 108 a similar&nbsp;remedy is given in the county court where the rent does not exceed&nbsp;£50 per annum. Analogous provisions are contained in Acts&nbsp;dealing with the metropolitan district. It should be noticed&nbsp;that, since the writing of the article </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Distress, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the landlord’s&nbsp;power of distress has been considerably limited in the case of&nbsp;agricultural tenancies falling within the Agricultural Holdings Act,&nbsp;1883, 46 &amp; 47 Viet. c. 61. § 44 confines the right of distress to one&nbsp;year’s arrears of rent instead of six years’ arrears, ■which could be&nbsp;distrained for before the Act. An extension of time is allowed in&nbsp;cases where in the ordinary course of dealing between landlord and&nbsp;tenant the payment of rent has been allowed to be deferred for a&nbsp;quarter or half year after the rent became legally due. By § 45&nbsp;live stock belonging to another person and taken in by a tenant to&nbsp;be fed has a qualified privilege from distress ; that is, it is not&nbsp;distrainable where there is other sufficient distress to be found. If&nbsp;so distrained for want of other sufficient distress, it may be redeemed by the owner on payment of any sum due for the feeding.&nbsp;Agricultural or other machinery on the premises of the tenant for&nbsp;hire or use and live stock on the premises solely for breeding purposes are absolutely privileged from distress. The Act further&nbsp;makes appraisement before sale unnecessary, and enacts that bailiffs&nbsp;to levy distress are to be appointed by county court judges. For&nbsp;other provisions of the Act dealing with procedure, see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Replevin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ireland.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—The main differences between Irish and English law have been caused by legislation (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Landlord and Tenant). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">One&nbsp;of the most noticeable is the power of ejectment for non-payment&nbsp;of rent given by 23 &amp; 24 Viet. c. 154. In England such a power&nbsp;can only be conferred by express agreement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—Rent is properly the payment made by tenant to landlord for the use of lands held under lease. The rent paid by&nbsp;vassal to superior is called feu-duty (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Fed). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Its nearest English&nbsp;equivalent is the fee farm rent. Rents are recovered by an action&nbsp;of maills and duties in the Sheriff Court or the.Court of Session,&nbsp;and in non-agricultural tenancies by hypothec. The right of&nbsp;hypothec over land exceeding 2 acres in ext! nt let for agriculture&nbsp;or pasture has been abolished as from November 11, 1881 (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hypo</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">thec). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1883, 46 &amp; 47&nbsp;Viet, c. 62, provides by § 27 that when six months’ rent of the holding is due and unpaid the landlord may raise an action of removing&nbsp;before the sheriff against the tenant, concluding for his removal&nbsp;at the term of Whitsunday or Martinmas next ensuing ; and, unless&nbsp;the arrears are paid or caution is found, the sheriff may decern the&nbsp;tenant to remove. The tenant so removed has the rights of an&nbsp;outgoing tenant. Labour or service rents were at one time very&nbsp;frequent in Scotland. The events of 1715 and 1745 showed the&nbsp;vast influence over the tenantry that the great proprietors acquired by such means. Accordingly the Acts of 1 Geo. I., sess.&nbsp;2, c. 54, and 20 Geo. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">II. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">c. 50, provided for the commutation of&nbsp;services into money rents. Such services may still be created by&nbsp;agreement, subject to the summary power of commutation by the&nbsp;sheriff given by the Conveyancing Act, 1874, 37 &amp; 38 Viet. c. 94,&nbsp;§§ 20, 21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> In the more remote parts of Scotland </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">is understood</span></p>
