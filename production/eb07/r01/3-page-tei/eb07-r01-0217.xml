Upon these we must enter more minutely, the latter being by far the most admirable of Demosthenes’s works.</p><p>While the Athenians were engaged in their struggle against Philip, Ctesiphon had moved and carried in the assembly of the people a decree for honouring Demosthenes with a civic crown, as a benefactor of his country. After the battle of Chæronæa had made Greece truly a province of Macedon, Philip and his son, by a very sound policy, allowed the Greek citizens to fight out their old political quarrels ; and Athens continued to be torn in pieces by her two factions, as incessantly as when the one, headed by Demosthenes, had opposed Philip to the death, and the other, actuated by very various motives, and led by Æschines in alliance with the virtuous Phocion and others of the aristocratic party, had urged early submission to the conqueror. The latter faction eagerly seized Ctesiphon’s decree as a means of crushing Demosthenes. It was grossly and undeniably illegal in two respects ; having been issued before Demosthenes had given in his accounts for certain public offices which he then held, and having directed the proclamation of the honour to be made in the theatre, not in one of the national assemblies ; both of which acts were forbidden by subsisting laws. If, then, the sole end had been to procure a conviction against Ctesiphon, and if the court appointed to try him had been well informed and impartial, the issue could not have been for a moment doubtful. The court, however, possessed neither of these qualifications ; and, moreover, although Ctesiphon was nominally the person impeached, yet the sentence against him was avowedly intended to be used as a vote of censure on the whole political conduct of Demosthenes, and the proceedings would not, to the slightest extent, have answered the purpose of their promoters unless this should be their understood result. On this ground both parties prepared to fight the battle ; and the contest, prompted by party spirit and personal animosity, involving in its decision no great</p><p>political question, and debased in its progress by number-less instances of calumny and malevolence on both sides, has nevertheless given us two such specimens of eloquence as neither judicial nor political oratory has equalled before or since.</p><p>Those who recollect that this was the real state of the question, will admire the skill and judgment exhibited by Æschines in conducting his argument in support of the accusation; in which, if we are to believe that the parties understood Ctesiphon to be the real and only defendant, he cannot be absolved from the charge of having made a most injudicious, and indeed partially irrelevant choice of topics, and of having by his line of remark wilfully drawn upon himself the triumphant reply of his adversary.</p><p>The exordium is simple, but very fine : it contains a complaint of factious and unlawful exertions made by the opposite party, and of an inveterate disuse of certain old regulations, which disuse had enabled demagogues to carry laws destructive of the constitution: it declares the right of impeaching the proposers of such measures to be the only remaining safeguard of the state : and it concludes with an animated address, calling on the judges to deal fearlessly with the cause, as the sworn administrators of justice and as citizens intrusted with the protection of the laws and of freedom, like soldiers placed in the front of the battle.</p><p>The speaker instantly passes to the strong part of his case,—a clear exposition of thc several laws which Ctesiphon’s decree was alleged to have transgressed, a proof from the public records that the decree had in fact violated those enactments, and a statement and refutation of every sophism by which the adversary could be conceived likely to support the plea that the laws did not apply to the notorious facts. His argument, in all its parts, is completely unanswerable ; but it occupies barely a sixth part of the oration ; and the words of the decree, assigning as reasons for the honour conferred on Demosthenes, his virtue, his courage, and his constant pursuit of the true weal of the state, give the cue for the commencement of the attack upon him, the real object of the prosecution. The nominal defendant is dropped as an incumbrance, and the orator girds himself manfully for the serious part of the onset. We cannot follow him through the details of his enemy’s political conduct, private life, doubtful pedigree, and faulty oratory, all of which are described with a plausible minuteness, and with the keenest sarcasm. Political folly is the slightest of the charges : Demosthenes is accused, at every step, of political dishonesty,—of peculation and corruption,—of favour to the Persian king, and co-operation with his views, a charge which was quite true and quite creditable to the accused, but was as skilfully chosen for rousing Athenian prejudices as a charge of combination with France would have been for exciting an English mob in 1793,—and (which sounds rather oddly) he is roundly taxed with a secret attachment to the Macedonian interest, and with the secret acceptance of bribes from Philip. There were two points in which Æschines had a strong hold on his antagonist, and with which he therefore taunts him incessantly : the unhappy issue of the war with Philip, which, it is again and again asserted, had been wholly caused by the policy of Demosthenes ; and that orator’s unfortunate deficiency in personal courage, which had prompted him to a disgraceful flight at the battle of Chæronæa. There are many fine passages in the earlier parts of this long review ; but the orator does not begin to rise steadily till, in closing the main section of his argument under this head, he recalls the glory of the Persian times, and contrasts the simple honours which rewarded the patriotism of Miltiades, Aristides, and the soldiers who conquered in the battle of the Strymon, with the profuse decorations now every day lavished on the chiefs of petty factions.</p><p>He then reminds the judges that, after all, from the terms of those articles of impeachment which they sat there to try, even his failure in convincing them that Demosthenes was a bad man and a bad citizen would not entitle Ctesi-phon to an acquittal, since his decree, as proved in the first part of the argument, was at any rate manifestly illegal : he urges them to insist on Ctesiphon or his advocate keeping closely to the point ; and he exhorts them yet more strenuously to compel his adherence to the division of the argument which Æschines had laid down, and still more parti-cularly to the order of the topics adopted in that division. He now proceeds with increased rapidity and vehemence. He anticipates Demosthenes’s passionate style of address, cautions the judges against its effects, and endeavours to render it ridiculous by mimicry. He answers by anticipation, and with much manliness and candour, though with severe recrimination, the personal abuse which he professed to be certain that Demosthenes would heap upon him.</p><p>He then, entering on his peroration, passes to a summary of the whole argument, amounting to this, that the decree was illegal, and that, although it had been perfectly regular, Demosthenes was utterly unworthy of the honours which it conferred. He thence rises into one of the noblest and most effective exhortations which the records of oratory have to exhibit ; opening with skilfully chosen instances of the severity with which the existing laws had recently punished citizens who deserted their country, as Demosthenes had deserted his place in battle and his duty as an adviser of the state ; reminding the judges of those feelings of shame with which the Athenians would appear in the presence of Greece at the approaching national convocation, if they should have failed to brand with infamy the destroyer of their country ; and closing with what is perhaps the very grandest extant example of solemn imaginative eloquence.</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
