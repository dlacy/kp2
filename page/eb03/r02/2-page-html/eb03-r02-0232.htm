<p><span class="font1">Solving to ruin the </span><span class="font0">inhabitants, and </span><span class="font1">to de</span><span class="font0">ſtr</span><span class="font1">oy </span><span class="font0">the. whole ſenate. His ſoldiers, however, upon approaching the&nbsp;capital began to waver in their reſolutions : wherefore&nbsp;he was obliged to have recourſe to intreaties, imploring&nbsp;them not to abandon him ; and, retiring by the ſame&nbsp;route by which he had advanced, made Licinius, who&nbsp;was originally the ſon of a poor labourer in Dacia, Cæſar, in the room of Severus who was ſlain. This ſeemed to be the laſt act of his power ; for ſhortly after he&nbsp;was ſeized with a very extraordinary diſorder in his&nbsp;privities, which baffled all the ſkill of his phyſicians,&nbsp;and carried him off, after he had languiſhed in torments&nbsp;for near the ſpace of a year. His cruelty to the Chri-ſtians was one of the many crimes alleged againſt him ;&nbsp;and their hiſtorians have not failed to aggravate the circumſtances of his death as a judgment from Heaven&nbsp;for his former impiety. However this be, he abated&nbsp;much of his ſeverities againſt them on his deathbed ;&nbsp;and revoked thoſe edicts which he had formerly publiſhed, tending to their perſecution, a little before his&nbsp;death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Conſtantine being thus delivered from his greateſt opponent, might now be conſidered as poſſeſſing more&nbsp;power than any of his rivals who were yet remaining.&nbsp;The empire was at that time divided between him and&nbsp;three others : Maxentius, who governed in Rome, a&nbsp;perſon of a cruel diſpoſition, and a ſtedfaſt ſupporter of&nbsp;paganiſm ; Licinius, who was adopted by Galerius, and&nbsp;commanded in the eaſt ; and likewiſe Maximin, who&nbsp;had formerly been declared Cæſar with Severus, and&nbsp;who alſo governed ſome of the eaſtern provinces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For ſome time all things ſeemed to wear a peaceful appearance ; till at length, either ambition, or the tyrannical conduct of Maxentius, induced Conſtantine to&nbsp;engage in an expedition to expel that commander from&nbsp;Rome, and to make the proper preparations for marching into Italy. It was upon this occaſion that he formed a reſolution which produced a mighty change in the&nbsp;politics as well as the morals of mankind, and gave a&nbsp;new turn to the councils of the wife, and the purſuſts&nbsp;ambition. One evening, as we are told by Euſebius,&nbsp;the army being upon its march toward Rome, Conſtantine was taken up with various conſiderations upon&nbsp;the fate of ſublunary things, and the dangers of his approaching expedition : ſenſible of his own incapacity&nbsp;to ſucceed without divine aſſiſtance, he employed his&nbsp;meditations upon the opinions that then were chiefly&nbsp;agitated among mankind, and ſent up his ejaculations&nbsp;to Heaven to inſpire him with wiſdom to chooſe the&nbsp;path he ought to purſue. It was then, as the ſun was&nbsp;declining, that there ſuddenly appeared a pillar of light&nbsp;in the heavens, in the faſhion of a croſs, with this inſcription, τoττn νίκη “ In this overcome.” So extraordinary an appearance did not fail to create aſtoniſhment both in the emperor and his whole army, who&nbsp;conſidered it as their dilpoſitions led them to believe.&nbsp;Thoſe who were attached to paganiſm, prompted by&nbsp;their auſpices, pronounced it a moſt inauſpicious omen,&nbsp;portending the moſt unfortunate events. But it made&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">different impreſſion on the emperor’s mind ; who, as&nbsp;the account goes, was farther encouraged by viſions the&nbsp;ſime night. He therefore, the day following, cauſed a&nbsp;royal ſtandard to be made, like that which he had ſeen&nbsp;in the heavens ; and commanded it to be carried before&nbsp;him in his wars, as an enſign </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">victory and celeſtial&nbsp;protection. After this, </span><span class="font1">he conſulted with ſeveral of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the principal teachers of Chriſtianity, and made a public avowal of that ſacred perſuafion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Conſtantine having thus attached his ſoldiers to his intereſt, who were moſtly of the Chriſtian perſuafion,&nbsp;loſt no time in entering Italy with 90,000 foot and&nbsp;8000 horſe ; and ſoon advanced to the very gates of&nbsp;Rome. The unfortunate Maxentius, who had long given himſelf up to eaſe and debauchery, now began to<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>make preparations when it was too late. He ſirlh put&nbsp;in practice all the ſupeiſtitious rites which paganiſm_&nbsp;taught to be neceſſary; and then conſulted the Sibylline books ; from whence he was informed, that on that&nbsp;great day the enemy of Rome ſhould periſh. This prediction, which was equivocal, he applied to Conſtantine ; -wherefore, leaving all things in the beſt poſture,&nbsp;he advanced from the city with an army of 100,000&nbsp;foot and 18,000 horſe. The engagement was for ſome&nbsp;time fierce and bloody, till his cavalry being routed,&nbsp;victory declared upon the ſide of his opponent, and be&nbsp;himſelf was drowned in his flight by the breaking down&nbsp;of a bridge as he attempted to croſs the river Tiber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Conſtantine, in conſequence of this victory, entering the city, diſclaimed all praiſes which the ſenate and&nbsp;people were ready to offer ; alcribiug his ſucceſs to a&nbsp;ſuperior power. He even cauſed the croſs, which he&nbsp;was ſaid to have ſeen in the heavens, to be placed at&nbsp;the right of all his ſtatues, with this inſcription : “That&nbsp;under the influence of that victorious croſs, Conſtantine&nbsp;had delivered the city from the yoke of tyrannical&nbsp;power, and had reſtored the ſenate and people of Rome&nbsp;to their ancient authority.” He afterwards ordained,&nbsp;that no criminal ſhould for the future ſuffer death by&nbsp;the croſs ; which had formerly been the moſt uſual way&nbsp;of puniſhing ſlaves convicted of capital offences. Edicts&nbsp;were ſoon after iſſued, declaring that the Chriſtians&nbsp;ſhould be eaſed from all their grievances, and received&nbsp;into places of truſt and authority. Thus the new religion was ſeen at once to prevail over the whole Roman&nbsp;empire; and as that enormous fabric had been built and&nbsp;guided upon pagan principles, it loſt a great deal of it»&nbsp;ſtrength and coherence when thoſe principles were thus&nbsp;at once ſubverted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Things continued in this ſtate for ſome time, Conſtantine all the while contributing what was in his power to the intereſt of religion, and the revival of learning,&nbsp;which had long been upon the decline, and was almoſt&nbsp;wholly extinct in the empire. But in the midſt of theſe&nbsp;aſſiduities, the peace of the empire was again diſturbed&nbsp;by the preparations of Maximin, who governed in the&nbsp;eaſt, and who, deſirous of a full participation of power,,&nbsp;marched againſt Licinius with a very numerous army.&nbsp;In conſequence of this ſtep, after many conflicts, a general engagement enſued, in which Maximin ſuffered a&nbsp;total deteat ; many of his troops were cut to pieces,&nbsp;and thoſe that ſurvived ſubmitted to the conqueror.&nbsp;Maximin, however, having eſcaped the general carnage,&nbsp;once more put himſelſ at the head of another army, reſolving to try the fortune of the field ; but death prevented his deſign. As he died by-a very extraordinary&nbsp;kind of madneſs, the Chriſtians, of whom he was the&nbsp;declared enemy, did not fail to aſeribe his end to a&nbsp;judgment from heaven ; but this was the age in which&nbsp;falſe judgments and falſe miracles made up the bulk of&nbsp;their uninſtructive hiſtory'.</span></p>
