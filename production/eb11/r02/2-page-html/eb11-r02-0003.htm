<p><span class="font5">so many have been issued privately or by individuals that reference should be made to the lists in Marshall's </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Genealogist's&nbsp;Guide</span><span class="font5"> (1893) and Dr Cox’s </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Parish Registers</span><span class="font5"> (1910), and even&nbsp;this last is not perfect. The Huguenot Society has printed&nbsp;several registers of the Protestant Refugees, and Mr Moens&nbsp;that of the London Dutch church. There are also several&nbsp;registers of marriages alone now in print, such as that of St&nbsp;Dunstan’s, Stepney, in 3 vols. Colonel Chester’s extensive&nbsp;MS. collection of extracts from parish registers is now in the&nbsp;College of Arms, London, and the parishes are indexed in&nbsp;Dr Marshall’s book. MS. extracts in the British Museum are&nbsp;dealt with in Sims’ </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Manual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Scotland registers of baptisms and marriages were instituted by the clergy in 1551, and burials were added by order of the Privy Council in 1616; but these were very imperfectly&nbsp;kept, especially in rural parishes. Yet it was not till 1854&nbsp;that civil registration was introduced, by act of parliament,&nbsp;in their stead. Some 900 parish registers, beginning about&nbsp;1563, have been deposited in the Register House, Edinburgh,&nbsp;under acts of parliament which apply to all those prior to 1819.&nbsp;Mr Hallen has printed the register of baptisms of Muthill&nbsp;Episcopal Church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In Ireland, parish registers were confined to the now disestablished church, which was that of a small minority, and were, as in Scotland, badly kept. Although great inconvenience&nbsp;was caused by this system, civil registration of marriages,&nbsp;when introduced in 1844, was only extended to Protestants,&nbsp;nor was it till 1864 that universal civil registration was introduced, great difficulty under the Old Age Pensions Act being&nbsp;now the result. No provision was made, as in Scotland, for&nbsp;central custody of the registers, which, both Anglican and&nbsp;Nonconformist, remain in their former repositories. Roman&nbsp;Catholic registers in Ireland only began, apparently, to be&nbsp;kept in the 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">In France registers, but only of baptism, were first instituted in 1539. The Council of Trent, however, made registers both&nbsp;of baptisms and of marriages a law of the Catholic Church in&nbsp;1563, and Louis XIV. imposed a tax on registered baptislks and&nbsp;marriages in 1707.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5">REGISTRATION. In all systems of law the registration of certain legal facts has been regarded as necessary, chiefly&nbsp;for the purpose of ensuring publicity and simplifying evidence.&nbsp;Registers, when made in performance of a public duty, are as&nbsp;a general rule admissible in evidence merely on the production&nbsp;from the proper custody of the registers themselves or (in most&nbsp;cases) of examined or certified copies. The extent to which&nbsp;registration is carried varies very much in different countries.&nbsp;For obvious reasons, judicial decisions are registered in all&nbsp;countries alike. In other matters no general rule can be laid&nbsp;down, except perhaps that on the whole registration is not as&nbsp;fully enforced in the United Kingdom and the United States&nbsp;as in continental states. The most important uses of registration occur in the case of judicial proceedings, land, ships, bills&nbsp;of sale, births, marriages and deaths, companies, friendly and&nbsp;other societies, newspapers, copyrights, patents, designs, trade&nbsp;marks and professions and occupations. In England registrars&nbsp;are attached to the privy council, the Supreme Court and the&nbsp;county courts. In the king’s bench division (except in its&nbsp;bankruptcy jurisdiction) the duty of registrars is performed by&nbsp;the masters. Besides exercising limited judicial authority,&nbsp;registrars are responsible for the drawing up and recording of&nbsp;various stages of the proceedings from the petition, writ or&nbsp;plaint to the final decision.@@<sup>1</sup> With them are filed affidavits,&nbsp;depositions, pleadings, &amp;c., when such filing is necessary. The&nbsp;difference between filing and registration is that the documents&nbsp;filed are filed without alteration, while only an epitome is&nbsp;usually registered. The Judicature Act 1873 created district&nbsp;registries in the chief towns, the district registrar having an&nbsp;authority similar to that of a registrar of the Supreme Court.&nbsp;In the admiralty division cases of account are usually referred&nbsp;to the registrar and merchants. The registration in the central&nbsp;office of the supreme court of judgments affecting lands, writ3&nbsp;of execution, recognizances and </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">liles pendentes</span><span class="font5"> in England, and&nbsp;the registration in Scotland of abbreviates of adjudications&nbsp;and of inhibitions, are governed by special legislation. All&nbsp;these are among the incumbrances for which search is made on&nbsp;investigating a title. Decisions of criminal courts are said to&nbsp;be recorded, not registered, except in the case of courts of&nbsp;summary jurisdiction, in which, by the Summary Jurisdiction&nbsp;Act 1879, a register of convictions is kept. Probates of wills&nbsp;and letters of administration, which arc really judicial decisions,&nbsp;are registered in the principal or district registries of the probate&nbsp;division. In Scotland registration is used for giving a summary&nbsp;remedy on obligations without action by means of the fiction of&nbsp;a judicial decision having been given establishing the obligation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Registration of Voters,—</span><span class="font5">Prior to 1832 the right of parliamentary electors in England was determined at the moment of the tender of the vote at the election, or, in the event of a&nbsp;petition against the return, by a scrutiny, a committee of the&nbsp;House of Commons striking off those whose qualification was&nbsp;held to be insufficient, and, on the other hand, adding those&nbsp;who, having tendered their votes at the poll, with a good title&nbsp;to do so, were rejected at the time. A conspicuous feature of&nbsp;the Reform Act of that year was the introduction of a new&nbsp;mode of ascertaining the rights of electors by means of an&nbsp;entirely new system of published lists, subject to claims and&nbsp;objections, and after due inquiry and revision forming a register&nbsp;of voters. Registration was not altogether unknown in Great&nbsp;Britain in connexion with the parliamentary franchise before&nbsp;the Reform Acts of 1832. Thus in the Scottish counties the&nbsp;right to vote depended on the voter’s name being upon the&nbsp;roll of freeholders established by an act of Charles II.; a&nbsp;similar register existed in Ireland of freeholders whose freeholds were under £20 annual value; and in the universities&nbsp;of Oxford and Cambridge the rolls of members of Convocation&nbsp;and of the Senate were, as they still arc, the registers of parliamentary voters. But except in such cases as the above,&nbsp;the right of a voter had to be determined by the returning&nbsp;officer upon the evidence produced before him when the vote&nbsp;was tendered at a poll. This necessarily took time, and the&nbsp;result was that a contested election in a large constituency&nbsp;might last for weeks. The celebrated Westminster election of&nbsp;1784, in which the poll began on the ist of April and ended on&nbsp;the 17th of May, may be mentioned as an illustration. Moreover, the decision of the returning officer was not conclusive;&nbsp;the title of every one who claimed to vote was liable to be&nbsp;reconsidered on an election petition, or, in the case of a rejected&nbsp;vote, in an action for damages by the voter against the returning&nbsp;officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The inconvenience of such a state of things would have been greatly aggravated had the old practice continued after the&nbsp;enlargement of the franchise in 1832. The establishment of a&nbsp;general system of registration was therefore a necessary and&nbsp;important part of the reform then effected. It has enabled an&nbsp;election in the most populous constituency to be completed in&nbsp;a single day. It has also been instrumental in the extinction</span></p>
