<p><span class="font2">south-east, the Riesengebirge proper run south-east and north-west between the sources of the Zacken and the&nbsp;Bober, for a distance of 23 miles, with a breadth of 14&nbsp;miles. They cover an area of about 425 square miles, three-fourths of which is in Austrian and the remainder in&nbsp;Prussian territory. The boundary line follows the crest&nbsp;of the principal chain or ridge (Riesenkamm), with the&nbsp;highest summits, which stretches along the northern&nbsp;side of the group, with an average height of over 4000&nbsp;feet. Its principal peaks are the Reifträger (4430 feet),&nbsp;the Hohe Rad (4968 feet), the Great Sturmhaube (4862&nbsp;feet), the Little Sturmhaube (4646 feet), and, near the east&nbsp;extremity, the Schneekoppe or Riesenkoppe (5266 feet),&nbsp;the loftiest mountain in northern or central Germany.&nbsp;Roughly parallel to this northern ridge, and separated&nbsp;from it by a long narrow valley known as the Siebengründe, there extends on the south a second and lower&nbsp;chain, of broad massive “saddles,” with comparatively&nbsp;few peaks. The chief heights here are the Kesselkoppe&nbsp;(4708 feet), the Krkonose (4849 feet), the Ziegenrücken,&nbsp;and the Brunnenberg (5072 feet). From both ridges&nbsp;spurs of greater or less length are sent off at various&nbsp;angles,—those from the Bohemian ridge being longer,&nbsp;broader, and less abrupt than those from the Riesenkamm.&nbsp;On its northern side this mountain group rises ruggedly&nbsp;and precipitously from the Hirschberg valley ; but on its&nbsp;southern side its slope towards Bohemia is very much&nbsp;more gradual. The scenery is in general bold and wild,—&nbsp;the projecting crags and deep rocky gorges and precipices&nbsp;often presenting striking, sometimes even sublime, landscapes. The Bohemian ridge is cleft about the middle&nbsp;by a deep gorge through which pour the headwaters of&nbsp;the river Elbe, which finds its source in the Siebengründe.&nbsp;The Iser, Bober, Aupa, Zacken, Queiss, and a great number&nbsp;of smaller streams also rise among these mountains or on&nbsp;their skirts ; and small lakes and tarns are not unfrequent&nbsp;in the valleys. The Great and Little Schneegruben,—two&nbsp;deep rocky gorge-like valleys in which snow remains all the&nbsp;year round—lie to the north of the Hohe Rad. Nearly the&nbsp;whole of the Riesenkamm and the western portion of the&nbsp;southern chain are granite ; the eastern extremity of the&nbsp;main ridge and several mountains to the south-east are&nbsp;formed of a species of gneiss ; and the greater part of the&nbsp;Bohemian chain, especially its summits, consists of&nbsp;mica-slate. Blocks of these minerals lie scattered on the&nbsp;sides and ridges of the mountains and in the beds of the&nbsp;streams ; and extensive turf moors occupy many of the&nbsp;mountain slopes and valleys. The lower parts of the&nbsp;Riesengebirge are clad with forests of oak, beech, pine, and&nbsp;fir; above 1600 feet only the last two kinds of trees are&nbsp;found, and beyond about 3950 feet only the dwarf pine&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Pinus Pumilio).</span><span class="font2"> Various alpine plants are found on the&nbsp;Riesengebirge,—some having been artificially introduced&nbsp;on the Schneekoppe. &quot;Wheat is grown at an elevation of&nbsp;1800 feet above the sea-level, and oats as high as 2700&nbsp;feet. The inhabitants of this mountain region, who&nbsp;are tolerably numerous, especially on the Bohemian side,&nbsp;live for the most part, not in villages, but in scattered&nbsp;huts called “Bauden.” They support themselves by the&nbsp;rearing of cattle, tillage, glass-making, and linen-weaving.&nbsp;Mining is carried on only to a small extent for arsenic,&nbsp;although there are traces of former more extensive workings&nbsp;for other metals. Several spots in the Riesengebirge are a&nbsp;good deal frequented as summer resorts ; and the Schneekoppe and other summits are annually visited by a considerable number of travellers, who find shelter in the&nbsp;Bauden. The Riesengebirge is the legendary home of&nbsp;Number Nip (Rübezahl), a half-mischievous half-friendly&nbsp;goblin of German folklore ; and various localities in the&nbsp;group are more or less directly associated with his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RIETI, a city of Italy, in the province of Perugia, 18∣ miles south-east of Terni, which is 69 miles by rail from&nbsp;Rome. It occupies a fine position 1396 feet above the sea&nbsp;on the right bank of the Velino (a torrent sub-tributary to&nbsp;the Tiber), which at this point issues from the limestone&nbsp;plateau ; the old town occupies the declivity and the new&nbsp;town spreads out on the level. &quot;While with its quaint red-roofed houses, its old town walls (restored about 1250), its&nbsp;castle, its cathedral (13th and 15th centuries), its episcopal&nbsp;palace (1283, Andrea Pisano), and its various churches and&nbsp;convents Rieti has no small amount of mediæval pictur-esqueness, it also displays a good deal of modern activity&nbsp;in wine-growing, cattle-breeding, and sugar-boiling. The&nbsp;fertility of the neighbourhood is celebrated both by Virgil&nbsp;and by Cicero. A Roman bridge over the Velino,&nbsp;Thorwaldsen’s monument to Isabella Alfani, and a statue&nbsp;of St Barbara by Berdini, both in the cathedral, and the&nbsp;Palazzo Vincentini by Vignola deserve to be mentioned.&nbsp;The population was 7875 in 1871, and 9618 (with suburbs,&nbsp;13,679; in the commune, 16,822) in 1881.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">According to Terentius Varro (himself perhaps of Reatino birth) and others who have followed him, the people who founded&nbsp;Cures, and afterwards settled on the Palatine at Rome, were natives&nbsp;of the Reatine territory ; but this is of somewhat the same&nbsp;questionable character as the other story about the companion of&nbsp;Hercules who was buried at this point near the Via Salaria. About&nbsp;the Via Salaria itself, there is no doubt it led from the sea to&nbsp;Reate and onwards towards Ancona, and was from a very early date&nbsp;the great route for the conveyance of salt to the Sabine country.&nbsp;While hardly mentioned in connexion with the Punic or Civil&nbsp;Wars, Reate is described by Strabo as exhausted by those long&nbsp;contests. Its inhabitants received the Roman franchise at the&nbsp;same time with the rest of the Sabines (290 b.c.), but it appears&nbsp;as a præfectura and not as a municipium down to the beginning&nbsp;of the empire. It was never made a colonia, though veterans of&nbsp;the Prætorian and of the legions Octava and Décima Augusta&nbsp;were settled there by Vespasian, who belonged to a Reatine family&nbsp;and was born in the neighbourhood. For the contests of the&nbsp;Reatines with the people of Interamna see Terni. About the&nbsp;middle of the 12th century the town was besieged and captured by&nbsp;Roger I. of Sicily. In the struggle between church and empire it&nbsp;always held with the former ; and it defied the forces of Frederick&nbsp;II. and Otho IV. Pope Nicholas IV. long resided at Rcati, and&nbsp;it was there he crowned Charles II. of Anjou king of the Two&nbsp;Sicilies. In the 14th century Robert, and afterwards Joanna,&nbsp;of Naples managed to keep possession of Reati for many years,&nbsp;but it returned to the States of the Church under Gregory IX.&nbsp;About the year 1500 tho liberties of the town, long defended&nbsp;against the encroachments of the popes, were entirely abolished.&nbsp;An earthquake in 1785 was in 1799 followed by the much more&nbsp;disastrous pillage of Reati by the papal troops for a space of&nbsp;fourteen days.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RIETSCHEL, Ernst Friedrich August (1804-1861), one of the most distinguished of modern German sculptors. Born at Pulsnitz in Saxony in 1804, at an early age&nbsp;he became an art student at Dresden, and subsequently&nbsp;a pupil of Rauch in Berlin. He there gained an art&nbsp;studentship, and studied in Rome in 1827-28. After&nbsp;returning to Saxony he soon brought himself into notice&nbsp;by a colossal statue of Frederick Augustus, king of&nbsp;Saxony, was elected a member of the academy of Dresden, and thenceforth became one of the chief sculptors of&nbsp;his country. In 1832 he was elected to the Dresden&nbsp;professorship of sculpture, and had many foreign orders&nbsp;of merit conferred on him by the Governments of&nbsp;different countries. His death occurred at Dresden in&nbsp;1861.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RietscheΓs style was very varied ; he produced works imbued with much religious feeling, and to some extent occupied the same&nbsp;place as a sculptor that Overbeck did in painting. Other important works by Rietschel were purely classical in style. He was&nbsp;specially famed for his portrait figures of eminent men, treated&nbsp;with much idealism and dramatic vigour ; among the latter class&nbsp;his chief works were colossal statues of Goethe and Schiller for the&nbsp;town of Weimar, of Weber for Dresden, and of Lessing for Bruns</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
