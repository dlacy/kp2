(Francis), a Jeſuit, was born in Granada on the 5th of January 1548. He was a professor of theology at Alcala, Salamanca, Rome, and Coimbra in Portugal. He died at Liſhon in 1617 with the greateſt reſignation ; “ I never thought (said he) that it was ſo eaſy to die.” His memory was aſtoniſhing, he could repeat the whole of his voluminous works by heart. His writings fill 23 folio volumes, and are moſtly on theological and moral ſubjects. His Treatiſe of Laws has been reprinted in this country. His Defence of the Catholic Faith againſt the Errors of England was written at the requeſt of pope Paul V. This book was publicly burnt at London by order of James I. When Suares heard it, he is ſaid to have exclaimed, “ O that I too could ſeal with my blood the truths which I have defended with my pen !”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
