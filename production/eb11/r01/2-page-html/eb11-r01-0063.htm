<p><span class="font0">approval of parliament, the bill is passed and, after securing the Royal Assent, becomes an act of parliament. The company&nbsp;is then free to proceed with the work of construction, and&nbsp;at once becomes subject to various general acts, such as the&nbsp;Companies Clauses Act, which affects all joint-stock companies&nbsp;incorporated by any special act; the Land Clauses Act, which&nbsp;has reference to all companies having powers to acquire land&nbsp;compulsorily; the Railway Clauses Act, which imposes certain&nbsp;conditions on all railways alike (except light railways); the&nbsp;various Regulation of Railways Acts; the Carriers Protection&nbsp;Act; acts for the conveyance of mails, parcels, troops; acts&nbsp;relating to telegraphs, to the conveyance of workmen and to&nbsp;the housing of the labouring classes; and several others which&nbsp;it is unnecessary to specify. From the early days of railways&nbsp;parliament has also been careful to provide for the safety of the&nbsp;public by inserting in the general or special acts definite con-ditions, and by laying upon the Board of Trade the duty of&nbsp;protecting the public using a railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first act which has reference to the safety of passengers is the Regulation of Railways Act of 1842, which obliges every&nbsp;railway company to give notice to the Board of Trade&nbsp;of its intention to open the railway for passenger&nbsp;traffic, and places upon that public department the&nbsp;duty of inspecting the line before the opening of it takes place.&nbsp;If the officer appointed by the Board of Trade should, after&nbsp;inspection of the railway, report to the department that in his&nbsp;opinion “the opening of the same would be attended with&nbsp;danger to the public using the same, by reason of the incompleteness of the works or permanent way, or the insufficiency of the&nbsp;establishment for working such railway, ” it is lawful for the&nbsp;department to direct the company to postpone the opening of&nbsp;the line for any period not exceeding one month at a time, the&nbsp;process being repeated from month to month as often as may be&nbsp;necessary. The company is liable to a fine of twenty pounds a&nbsp;day if it should open the line in contravention of such order or&nbsp;direction. The inspections made by the officers of the Board&nbsp;of Trade under this act are very complete: the permanent&nbsp;way, bridges, viaducts, tunnels and other works are carefully&nbsp;examined; all iron or steel girders are tested; stations, including&nbsp;platforms, stairways, waiting-rooms, &amp;c., are inspected; and&nbsp;the signalling and “ interlocking ” are thoroughly overhauled.&nbsp;A code of requirements in regard to the opening of new railways&nbsp;has been drawn up by the department for the guidance of railway&nbsp;companies, and as the special circumstances of each line are&nbsp;considered on their merits, it rarely happens that the department finds it necessary to prohibit the opening of a new railway.&nbsp;The Regulation of Railways Act of 1871 extends the provisions&nbsp;of the above act to the opening of “ any additional line of&nbsp;railway, deviation line, station, junction or crossing on the&nbsp;level ’’ which forms a portion of or is connected with a passenger&nbsp;railway, and which has been constructed subsequently to the&nbsp;inspection of it. This act further defines the duties and powers&nbsp;of the inspectors of the Board of Trade, and also authorizes the&nbsp;Board to dispense with the notice which the previous act</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">requires to be given prior to the opening of a railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It may be remarked that neither of these acts confers on the Board of Trade any power to inspect a railway after it has once&nbsp;been opened, unless and until some addition or alteration, such&nbsp;as is defined in the last-named act, has been made. When a line&nbsp;has once been inspected and passed, it lies with the company to&nbsp;maintain it in accordance with the standard of efficiency it&nbsp;originally possessed, but no express statutory obligation to do&nbsp;so is imposed upon the company, and whether it does so or not,&nbsp;the Board of Trade cannot interfere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The act of 1871 further renders it obligatory upon every railway company to send notice to the Board of Trade in the&nbsp;case of (1) any accident attended with loss of life or&nbsp;personal injury to any person whatsoever; (2) any&nbsp;collision where one of the trains is a passenger train;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any passenger train or part of such train leaving the rails;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any other accident likely to have caused loss of life or&nbsp;personal injury, and specified on that ground by any order&nbsp;made from time to time by the Board of Trade. The department is authorized, on receipt of such report, to direct an inquiry&nbsp;to be made into the cause of any accident so reported, and the&nbsp;inspector appointed to make the inquiry is given power to enter&nbsp;any railway premises for the purposes of his inquiry, and to&nbsp;summon any person engaged upon the railway to attend the&nbsp;inquiry as a witness, and to require the production of all books,&nbsp;papers and documents which he considers important for the&nbsp;purpose. The inspector, after making his investigation, is re-quirçd to make a report to the Board of Trade as to the causes&nbsp;of the accident and the circumstances attending the same, with&nbsp;any observations on the subject which he deems right, and the&nbsp;Board “ shall cause every such report to be made public in such&nbsp;manner as they think expedient. ” The usual mode of publishing such reports is to forward them to railway companies con-cerned, as well as to the press, and on application to any one&nbsp;else who is interested. The reports are subsequently included&nbsp;in a Blue-book and presented to parliament. It should be noted&nbsp;that although the inspecting officer may in his report make any&nbsp;recommendations that he may think fit with a view to guarding&nbsp;against any similar accident occurring in the future, no power&nbsp;is given to the Board of Trade, or to any other authority, to&nbsp;compel any railway company to adopt such recommendations.&nbsp;This omission is sometimes held to be an error, but as a fact it is&nbsp;an advantage. The moral effect of the report, with the criticisms&nbsp;of the company’s methods and recommendations appended&nbsp;thereto, is great, and it rarely happens that a company refuses to&nbsp;adopt, or at any rate to test, the recommendations so made. If,&nbsp;on the other hand, the company is of opinion that the suggestions&nbsp;of the inspecting officer are not likely to prove beneficial, or are&nbsp;for any reason unadvisable, it is at liberty to reject them, the&nbsp;responsibility of doing so resting entirely upon itself. The&nbsp;effect of this latitude is to give the company ample discretion&nbsp;in the matter, and to enable the act to be administered and&nbsp;the object of it to be attained without undue interference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1889 a very important act was passed placing upon the Board of Trade the obligation to call upon railway companies&nbsp;throughout the United Kingdom (1) to adopt upon&nbsp;all passenger lines the “ block ” system of working;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) to “ interlock ” their points and signals; (3) to fit all trains carrying passengers with some form of automatic continuous&nbsp;brake. Prior to this some companies had, to a certain extent,&nbsp;done these things, but few, if any, were completely equipped in&nbsp;these respects. A reasonable period was afforded them, according to circumstances, to comply with these requirements, and&nbsp;at the present time the work is practically complete. In this&nbsp;respect the lines of the United Kingdom are far ahead of those&nbsp;of any other country, and a diminution of accidents, particularly&nbsp;of collisions, has resulted therefrom. America is now following&nbsp;the lead thus set, and all the most important lines in the United&nbsp;States have adopted block working and interlocking, but a great&nbsp;deal still remains to be done. In certain respects, on the other&nbsp;hand, America has gone further than the United Kingdom,&nbsp;especially in the matter of automatic signalling, and in the&nbsp;operating of points and signals by electrical power or air-pressure&nbsp;instead of manual labour. In America, also, freight trains are&nbsp;fitted with an automatic continuous brake, whereas in the&nbsp;United Kingdom this appliance is required by law only in the&nbsp;case of passenger trains, and in fact is not fitted to goods and&nbsp;mineral trains except in a few isolated instances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The above-named acts enable the Board of Trade to take all the necessary steps to ensure that the safety of passenger trains&nbsp;is sufficiently guarded. More recently legislation has&nbsp;been passed to safeguard the lives and interests of&nbsp;railway servants. In 1893 an act was passed by&nbsp;parliament giving the Board power to interfere if or when&nbsp;representations are made to them by or on behalf of any servant&nbsp;or class of servants of a railway company that the hours of&nbsp;work are unduly long, or do not provide sufficient intervals&nbsp;of uninterrupted rest between the periods of duty, or sufficient&nbsp;relief in respect of Sunday duty. In such cases the company&nbsp;concerned may, after inquiry, be called upon to submit such a</span></p>
