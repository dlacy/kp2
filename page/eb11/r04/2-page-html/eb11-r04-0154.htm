<p><span class="font0">of eighteen married to the Byzantine princess Theophano. Thereupon the Romans, who had supported the election of&nbsp;another pope, and were in no awe of the new emperor, rose to&nbsp;arms under the command of Crescenzio, a rich and powerful noble. They not only seized Benedict VI. by force, but&nbsp;strangled him in the castle of St Angelo. The national and&nbsp;imperial parties then elected several popes who were either&nbsp;exiled or persecuted, and one of them was said to be murdered.&nbsp;In 985 John XV. was elected (985-96). During this turmoil,&nbsp;the national party, composed of nobles and people,&nbsp;led by Giovanni Crescenzio, son of the other Crescenzio&nbsp;mentioned above, had taken complete possession-of the government. This Crescenzio assumed the title of&nbsp;patrician, and sought to imitate Alberic, although far his&nbsp;inferior in capacity. Fortunately for him, the reigning pope&nbsp;was a detested tyrant, and the emperor a child entirely guided&nbsp;by his mother. But the new emperor Otto III. was backed&nbsp;by a powerful party, and on coming to Rome in 996 was able,&nbsp;although only aged fifteen, to quell the rebellion, oust Crescenzio&nbsp;from public life, and elect as successor to John XV. his own&nbsp;cousin, Pope Gregory V. (996-99). But this first German&nbsp;pope surrounded himself with compatriots, and by raising them&nbsp;to lofty posts even in the tribunals excited a revolt that drove&nbsp;him from the throne (29th September 999). Crescenzio, being&nbsp;master of the castle of St Angelo, resumed the title of patrician&nbsp;or consul of the Romans, expelled the German judges, reconstituted the government, prepared his troops for defence, and&nbsp;created a new pope. But the following year Otto III. came&nbsp;to Rome, and his party opened the gates to him. Although&nbsp;deserted by nearly all his adherents, Crescenzio held the castle&nbsp;valiantly against its besiegers. At last, on the 29th of April</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">998, he was forced to make terms, and the imperialists, violating their pledges, first put him to torture and then hurled him&nbsp;from the battlements. Gregory V. dying shortly after these&nbsp;events, Sylvester II., another native of southern France, who&nbsp;had been tutor to the emperor Otto III., was raised to the&nbsp;papacy (999-1003).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus Otto III. was enabled to establish his mastery of Rome. But, as the son of a Greek mother, trained amid Greek influences, his fantastic and contradictory nature seemed&nbsp;only to grasp the void. He wished to reconstitute&nbsp;a Romano-Byzantine empire with Rome for his capital. His&nbsp;discourse always turned on the ancient republic, on consuls&nbsp;and senate, on the might and grandeur of the Roman people;&nbsp;and his edicts were addressed to the senate and the people.&nbsp;The senate is now constantly mentioned, and its heads bear&nbsp;the title of consuls. The emperor also gave renewed honour&nbsp;to the title of patrician, surrounded himself with officials bearing&nbsp;Greek and Roman designations, and raised the prestige of the&nbsp;prefect, who, having now almost the functions of an imperial&nbsp;vicar, bore the eagle and the sword as his insignia. Nevertheless Otto III. was thoroughly German, and during his reign&nbsp;all Germanic institutions made progress in Rome. This was&nbsp;particularly the case with feudalism, and Sylvester II. was&nbsp;the first pope to treat it with favour. Many families of real&nbsp;feudal barons now arose. The Crescenzii held sway in the&nbsp;Sabine hills, and Praeneste and Tusculum were great centres&nbsp;of feudalism in the nth century. The system of feudal benefices was recognized by the church, which made grants of lands,&nbsp;cities and provinces in the feudal manner. The bishops, like&nbsp;feudal barons, became actual counts. And, in consequence of&nbsp;these changes, when the emperor, as head of the feudal system,&nbsp;seeks to impose his will upon the church (which has also become&nbsp;feudal) and control the papal elections, he is met by the great&nbsp;question of the investitures, a question destined to disturb&nbsp;the whole world. Meanwhile the Roman barons were growing&nbsp;more and more powerful, and were neither submissive nor&nbsp;faithful to the emperor. On the contrary, they resented his&nbsp;attitude as a master of Rome, and, when he subjected Tivoli&nbsp;to the Holy See, attacked both him and the pope with so much&nbsp;vigour as to put both to flight (16th February 1001). Thereupon Rome again became a republic, headed by Gregory of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tusculum, a man of a powerful family claiming descent from Alberic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the emperor’s death in January 1002 the race of the Ottos became extinct, the papacy began to decline, as at the&nbsp;end of the Carolingian period, and the nobles, divided into&nbsp;an imperial and a national party, were again predominant.&nbsp;They reserved to themselves the office of patrician, and, electing&nbsp;popes from their own ranks, obtained enlarged privileges and&nbsp;power. At the time when Ardoin, marquis of Ivrea, profiting&nbsp;by the extinction of the Ottos and the anarchy of Germany,&nbsp;was stirring Italy in the vain hope of constituting a national&nbsp;kingdom, the Roman Republic was being consohdated&nbsp;under another Giovanni Crescenzio, of the national&nbsp;faction. He was now elected patrician; one of&nbsp;his kinsmen was invested with the office of prefect,&nbsp;and the new pope John XVIII. (1003-9) <sup>was&nbsp;</sup>one of his creatures. Although the power of Henry oi&nbsp;Bavaria was then gaining ascendancy in Germany, and giving&nbsp;strength to the imperialist nobles, Crescenzio still remained&nbsp;supreme ruler of the city and the Campagna. Surrounded by&nbsp;his j’udges, the senators and his kinsman the prefect, he&nbsp;continued to dispense j’ustice in his own palace until his death&nbsp;in 1012, after ten years’ rule. And, Pope Sergius IV. having&nbsp;died the same year, the counts of Tusculum compassed the&nbsp;election of Benedict VIII. (1012-24), one of their own kin.&nbsp;This pope expelled the Crescenzii, changed the prefect and&nbsp;reserved the title of patrician for Henry II., whom he consecrated emperor .on the 14th February 1014. A second&nbsp;Alberic, bearing the title of “ eminentissimus consul et dux,”&nbsp;was now at the head of the repubEc and dispensed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">placita</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;the palace of his great ancestor, from whom the counts of&nbsp;Tusculum were also descended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The new emperor endeavoured to re-estabEsh order in Rome, and strengthen his own authority together with that of the&nbsp;pope. But the nobles had in all things the upper&nbsp;hand. They were regularly organized under leaders,&nbsp;held meetings, asserted their right to nominate both pope&nbsp;and emperor, and in fact often succeeded in so doing. Even&nbsp;Henry II. himseE was obliged to secure their votes before his&nbsp;coronation. The terms senate and senator now recur still&nbsp;more frequently in history. Nevertheless, Benedict VIII.&nbsp;succeeded in placing his own brother, Romano, at the head&nbsp;of the repubEc with the title of “ consul, dux and senator,”&nbsp;thus making him leader of the nobles, who met at his bidding,&nbsp;and chief of the militia and the tribunals. The prefect still&nbsp;retained his authority, and the emperor was by right supreme&nbsp;j’udge. But, a violent revolt breaking out, the emperor only&nbsp;stayed to suppress it and then went to Germany in disgust.&nbsp;The pope, aided by his brother, conducted the government&nbsp;with energy; he awed the party of Crescenzio, and waged&nbsp;war against the Saracens in the south. But he died in 1024,&nbsp;and in the same year Henry II. was succeeded by Conrad II.&nbsp;There was now beheld a repetition of the same strange event&nbsp;that had foUowed the death of Alberic, and with no less fatal&nbsp;consequences. Benedict’s brother Romano, head of the&nbsp;republic, and stiU retaining office, was, although a layman,&nbsp;elected pope. He took the name of John XIX. (1024-33),&nbsp;and in 1027 conferred the imperial crown on Conrad the Salic,&nbsp;who, aboEshing the Lothairian edict of 824, decreed that&nbsp;throughout Rome and its territory j’ustice should be henceforth&nbsp;administered solely by the Justinian code. Thus, notwithstanding the spread of feudaEsm and Germanic procedure,&nbsp;the Roman law triumphed through the irresistible force of the&nbsp;national character, which was already manifested in .many&nbsp;other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile John XIX. was succeeded by his nephew, Benedict IX. (1033-4sX a lad of twelve, who placed his own&nbsp;brother at the head of the repubEc. Thus church and state&nbsp;assumed the aspect of hereditary possessions in the powerful&nbsp;house of the counts of Tusculum. But the vices and excesses&nbsp;of Benedict were so monstrous that the papacy sank to the&nbsp;lowest depth of corruption; there foUowed a series of tumults</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
