<p><span class="font0">injunction was issued similar to that of 1597, with the important addition of a clause, appointing that the ancient registers, so far as they could be procured, but especially since the beginning of the reign of Elizabeth, should be copied&nbsp;into a parchment-book, to be provided by every parish ;&nbsp;after which, nothing more appears to have emanated, either&nbsp;from the ecclesiastical or civil authorities, on this subject,&nbsp;till the time of the Long Parliament, when the following&nbsp;entry in the Journal of the House of Commons gives evidence of attention to the importance of registration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Anno 1644, Dec. 6. Ordered, that it be referred to the committee for bringing in the ordinance for the establishing the directory, to bring in a clause in that ordinance, for registering the time of baptizing of children, and&nbsp;their parents’ names, and for registering of burials.” In&nbsp;the same year an ordinance was made, directing, that in&nbsp;every parish or chapelry in England and Wales, the minister and other church-officers should keep a register of&nbsp;birth and baptism, of marriage, and of burial ; and that all&nbsp;persons reasonably desiring it might search therein and obtain copies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In August 1653, in pursuance of the recommendations of a law-reform committee appointed in the preceding year,&nbsp;and including many eminent persons, an act was passed,&nbsp;which directed that in every parish a register-book shall be&nbsp;provided for registering all marriages, births, and burials&nbsp;in the parish ; and that the custody of such book, and the&nbsp;duty of registration, shall be given to a person, to be called&nbsp;the parish registrar, appointed by the parishioners chargeable to the poor, and approved by a justice of the peace.&nbsp;It was also enacted, that extra-parochial places, or small parishes, might be united, for the purposes of registration, to&nbsp;other parishes, by the justices at their sessions ; and that all&nbsp;existing register-books should be kept by the registering&nbsp;officers appointed under that act.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This act was not confirmed at the Restoration, and the business of registration reverted to the clergy of the established church. During the reigns of Charles II. and James&nbsp;II. nothing was done with respect to registers, except that,&nbsp;by a clause in the act of 30 Car. II. c. 3, entitled “ an&nbsp;act for burying in woollen,” it was enacted that all clergymen “ do, within their respective parishes, precincts, and&nbsp;places, take an exact account, and keep a register, of all and&nbsp;every person or persons buried in his or their respective&nbsp;parishes or precincts, or in such common burial-places as&nbsp;their respective parishioners are usually buried.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the reign of William III. registration was rendered a source of revenue. The act of 6 and 7 William III. c. 6,&nbsp;granted duties on births, marriages, and burials, and compelled the clergy, under a penalty of L.100, to keep an exact register of all persons born, christened, married, or&nbsp;buried in their respective parishes, to which register the collector of the tax, and all persons concerned, might have free&nbsp;access without fee. It thus imposed on the clergyman the&nbsp;onerous duty of acting gratuitously as a civil functionary,&nbsp;and collecting information of all births within his parish,&nbsp;without distinction of sect, and irrespective of baptism, a&nbsp;duty the difficulty of which was rendered greater by the&nbsp;attempts of the parents to conceal the birth, in order to&nbsp;elude the payment of the tax. With a view to obviate this&nbsp;objection, an act was passed in the following year (7 and 8&nbsp;William III. c. 35), which provided that parents should,&nbsp;within five days after birth, give notice of the day of the&nbsp;birth to the clergyman, under a penalty of forty shillings,&nbsp;and that the clergyman should, under a like penalty, register such birth, for which the parents were to pay sixpence ;&nbsp;and by the 4th of Anne, c. 12, the clergy were relieved&nbsp;from the ruinous penalties incurred under the act of 6 and&nbsp;7 William III. c. 6, in all cases where the duties ha&lt;¼ been&nbsp;really paid.</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">The 26th Geo. II. c. 33, an act “ to prevent clandestine</span></h1><div>
<p><span class="font0">marriages,” directed the church-wardens of every parish to provide books of vellum, or good and durable paper, for the&nbsp;registration of marriages. By the 23d of Geo. III. c. 67, a&nbsp;stamp-duty of threepence was imposed upon every registered entry of burial, marriage, birth, or christening, to be demanded by the clergyman from the undertaker, or from the&nbsp;parties married, or from the parents of the child whose&nbsp;birth or christening had been registered. By 25 Geo. III.&nbsp;c. 75, the provisions of that act were extended to dissenting&nbsp;ministers. These measures excited much objection, and&nbsp;were repealed in 1794.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next legislative measure affecting registers was the 52d Geo. III. c. 146, entitled “ an act for the better regulating and preserving parish and other registers of births,&nbsp;baptisms, marriages, and burials, in England.” After reciting that “ the amending the manner and form of keeping&nbsp;and of preserving registers of baptisms, marriages, and&nbsp;burials of his majesty’s subjects in the several parishes and&nbsp;places in England, will greatly facilitate the proof of pedigrees of persons claiming to be entitled to real or personal&nbsp;estates, and be otherwise of great public benefit and advantage,” it enacts, that, after the 31st of December 1812, registers of baptisms, marriages, and burials, according to the rites&nbsp;of the established church, shall be made and kept by the&nbsp;officiating minister of every parish and chapelry, in books&nbsp;to be provided by the king’s printer, at the expense of&nbsp;the respective parishes, according to the forms contained&nbsp;in schedules annexed to that act. These schedules contain&nbsp;the following particulars : In case of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">baptism,—</span><span class="font0">when baptized ; child’s Christian name ; parents’ Christian names and&nbsp;surnames ; abode ; quality, trade, or profession ; by whom&nbsp;the ceremony was performed. In case of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">marriage,—</span><span class="font0">the&nbsp;name and parish of the man ; the same of the woman ; when&nbsp;married ; whether by banns or license ; whether by consent&nbsp;of parents or guardians ; when ; by whom ; signature of&nbsp;officiating minister of the parties married, and of two witnesses. In case of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">burial,—</span><span class="font0">the name ; abode; when buried;&nbsp;age ; by whom the ceremony was performed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The registers of baptism, marriage, and burial were to be kept in separate books, and signed within seven days after&nbsp;each ceremony had been performed. Annual copies were&nbsp;to be made, verified, and signed by the officiating minister,&nbsp;and attested by the church-wardens, and transmitted by&nbsp;them yearly to the registrar of the diocese ; which registrar&nbsp;must report thereon to his bishop ; must deposit such copies&nbsp;in a safe receptacle, arranged for reference; and cause&nbsp;alphabetical lists of persons and places to be made, kept,&nbsp;and opened for search.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is to be observed that this act, which referred in its title to registers of births, made no provision for recording the&nbsp;date of birth. Neither did it provide a record of the date&nbsp;of death. It only provided records of the performance of&nbsp;the religious ceremonies of baptism, marriage, and burial,&nbsp;according to the rites of the Established Church. It therefore afforded an insufficient register, even for members of&nbsp;the Established Church, whilst for those who dissented from&nbsp;the Established Church, and therefore did not avail themselves of its ordinances for baptism or burial, it provided no&nbsp;register at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The inadequacy of this system, even if </span><span class="font1">frllly </span><span class="font0">carried into effect, and the insufficient manner in which it was complied&nbsp;with, called loudly for investigation and remedy, and became the subject of inquiry before a select committee of&nbsp;the House of Commons, appointed in March 1833, who,&nbsp;having, as they state, received evidence on registration&nbsp;“ from clergymen of the established church, and from parish-clerks; from gentlemen of the legal profession ; from authors&nbsp;devoted to antiquarian research ; from persons of different&nbsp;religious denominations, including Catholics, Dissenters,&nbsp;Jews, and Quakers ; from gentlemen eminently scientific,&nbsp;and attached to statistical inquiries ; from medical audio-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
