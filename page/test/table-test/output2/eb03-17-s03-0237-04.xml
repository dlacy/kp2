in geometry, is a part of a circle comprehended between two radii and the arch; or it is a mixed triangle, formed by two radii and the arch of a circle.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sector,</hi> is alſo a mathematical inſtrument, of great uſe in finding the proportion between quantities of the ſame kind: as between lines and lines, ſurfaces and ſurfaces, &amp; c. whence the French call it the <hi rend="italic">compaſs of proportion.</hi> The great advantage of the ſector above the common ſcales, &amp; c. is, that it is made ſo as to fit all radii and all ſcales. By the lines of chords, ſines, &amp; c. on the ſector, we have lines of chords, ſines, &amp; c. to any radius betwixt the length and breadth of the lector when open.</p><p>The real inventor of this valuable inſtrument is unknown; yet of ſo much merit has the invention appeared, that it was claimed by Galileo, and diſputed by nations.</p><p>The ſector is founded on the fourth propoſition of the ſixth book of Euclid; where it is demonſtrated, that ſimilar triangles have their homologous ſides proportional. An idea of the theory of its conſtruction may be conceived thus. Let the lines AB, AC (Plate CCCCXLVIII. fig. 5.) repreſent the legs of the ſector; and AD, AE, two equal lections from the centre: if, now the points CB and DE be connected, the lines CB and DE will be parallel; therefore the triangles ADE, ACB will be ſimilar; and conſequently the ſides AD, DE, AB, and BC, proportional; that is, as AD: DE: AB: BC: whence, if AD be the half, third, or fourth part of AB; DE will be a half, third, or fourth part of CB: and the ſame holds of all the reſt. If, therefore, AD be the chord, ſine, or tangent, of any number of degrees to the radius AB; DE will be the ſame to the radius BC.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Deſcription of the Sector.</hi> The inſtrument conſiſts of two rulers or legs, of braſs or ivory, or any other matter, repreſenting the radii, moveable round an axis or joint, the middle of which expreſſes the centre; whence are drawn on the faces of the rulers ſeveral ſcales, which may be diſtinguiſhed into ſingle and double.</p><p>The double ſcales, or lines graduated upon the faces of the inſtrument, and which are to be uſed as ſectoral lines, proceed from the centre; and are, 1. Two ſcales of equal parts, one on each leg, marked <hi rend="smallcaps">lin.</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">l.</hi> each of theſe ſeales, from the great extenſiveneſs of its uſe, is called the <hi rend="italic">line oſ lines. 2.</hi> Two lines of chords marked c <hi rend="smallcaps">ho.</hi> or c. 3. Two lines of ſecants marked <hi rend="smallcaps">sec.</hi> or s. A line of polygons marked <hi rend="smallcaps">pol.</hi> Upon the other face the ſectoral lines are, 1. Two lines of lines marked <hi rend="smallcaps">sin.</hi> or s. 2. Two lines of tangents marked <hi rend="smallcaps">tan.</hi> or T. 3. Between the line of tangents and ſines there is another line of tangents to a leſſer radius, to ſupply the defect of the former, and extending from 45⁰to 75⁰, marked t.</p><p>Each pair of theſe lines (except the line of polygons) is ſo adjuſted as to make equal angles at the centre; and conſequently at whatever diſtance the ſector be opened, the angles will be always reſpectively equal. That is, the diſtance between 10 and 10 on the line of lines, will be equal to 60 and 60 on the line of chords, 90 and 90 on the line of ſines, and 45 and 45 on the line of tangents.</p><p>Beſides the ſectoral ſcales, there are others on each face, placed parallel to the outward edges, and uſed as thoſe oſ the common plane ſcale. I. Theſe are a line of inches. 2. A line of latitudes. 3. A line of hours. 4. A line of inclination of meridians. 5. A line of chords. Three logarithmic ſcales, namely, one oſ numbers, one of ſines, and one of tangents; theſe are uſed when the ſector is fully opened, the legs forming one line<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> The lines are placed in different orders on different lectors, but they may eaſily be found by theſe general directions.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p><p>The value of the diviſions on moſt of the lines are determined by the figures adjacent to them; theſe proceed by tens, which conſtitute the diviſions of the firſt order, and are numbered accordingly; but the value of the diviſions on the line of lines, that are diſtinguiſhed by figures, is entirely arbitrary, and may repreſent any value that is given to them; hence the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp; c. may denote either 10, 20, 30, 40, or 100, 200, 300, 400, and ſo on.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The line oſ lines</hi> is divided into ten equal parts, numbered 1, 2, 3, to 10; theſe may be called d <hi rend="italic">ivisions of the first order;</hi> each of theſe are again ſubdivided into 10 other equal parts, which may be called <hi rend="italic">diviſions oſ the second order;</hi> each of theſe is divided into two equal parts, forming <hi rend="italic">diviſions oſ the third order.</hi> The diviſions on all the ſcales are contained between four parallel lines;<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0244.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0238"/>
thoſe of the third order extend to the moſt diſtant; thoſe of the third to the leaſt; thoſe of the ſecond to the intermediate parallel.</p><p>When the whole line of lines repreſents 100, the diviſions of the firſt order, or thoſe to which the figures are annexed, repreſent tens; thoſe of the ſecond order units; thoſe of the third order the halves of theſe units. If the whole line repreſent ten, then the diviſions of the firſt order are units; thoſe of the ſecond tenths; the thirds twentieths.</p><p>In the line of tangents, the diviſions to which the numbers are affixed, are the degrees expreſſed by thoſe numbers. Every fifth degree is denoted by a line ſomewhat longer than the reſt; between every number and each fifth degree, there are four diviſions, longer than the intermediate adjacent ones, theſe are whole degrees; the ſhorter ones, or thoſe of the third order, are 30 minutes.</p><p>From the centre, to 60 degrees, the line of ſines is divided like the line of tangents, from 60 to 70; it is divided only to every degree, from 70 to 80, to every two degrees, from 80 to 90; the diviſion muſt be eſtimated by the eye.</p><p>The diviſions on the line of chords are to be eſtimated in the ſame manner as the tangents.</p><p>The leſſer line of tangents is graduated every two degrees, from 45 to 50; but from 50 to 60 to every degree; from 60 to the end, to half degrees.</p><p>The line of ſecants from 0 to 10 is to be eſtimated by the eye; from 20 to 50, it is divided to every two degrees; from 50 to 60, to every degree; from 60 to the end, to every half degree.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Use of the Line of Equal Parts on the</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sector.</hi> 1. To divide a given line into any number of equal parts, ſuppoſe ſeven. Take the given line in your compaſſes; and ſetting one foot in a diviſion of equal parts, that may be divided by ſeven, for example 70, whoſe ſeventh part is 10, open the ſector till the other point fall exactly on 70, in the ſame line on the other leg. In this diſpoſition, applying one point of the compaſſes to 10 in the ſame line; ſhut them till the other fall in 10 in the ſame line on the other leg, and this opening will be the ſeventh part of the given line. Note, if the line to be divided be too long to be applied to the legs of the ſector, divide only one half or one fourth by ſeven, and the double or quadruple thereof will be the ſeventh part of the whole.</p><p>2. To meaſure the lines of the perimeter of a polygon, one of which contains a given number of equal parts. Take the given line in your compaſſes, and ſet it parallel, upon the line of equal parts, to the number on each leg expreſſing its length. The ſector remaining thus, ſet off the length of each of the other lines parallel to the former, and the number each of them falls on will expreſs its length.</p><p>3. A right line being given, and the number of parts it contains, ſuppoſe 120, to take from it a ſhorter line, containing any number of the ſame parts, ſuppoſe 25. Take the given line in your compaſſes, open the ſector till the two feet fall on 120 on each leg; then will the diſtance between 25 on one leg, and the ſame number on the other, give the line required.</p><p>4. Tο multiply by the line of equal parts on the lector. Take the lateral diſtance from the centre of the line to the given multiplicator: open the ſector till you fit that lateral diſtance to the parallel of 1 and 1, or 10 and 10, and keep the ſector in that diſpoſition; then take in the compaſſes the parallel diſtance of the multiplicand, which diſtance, meaſured laterally on the ſame line, will give the product required. Thus, ſuppoſe it were required to find the product of 8 multiplied by 4: take the lateral diſtance from the centre of the line to 4 in your compaſſes, i. <hi rend="italic">e.</hi> place one foot of the compaſſes in the beginning of the diviſions, and extend the other along the line to 4. Open the ſector till you fit this lateral diſtance to the parallel of 1 and I, or 10 and 10. Then take the parallel diſtance of 8, the multiplicand; <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> extend the compaſſes from 8, in this line, on one leg, to 8 in the ſame line on the other; and that extent, meaſured laterally, will give the product required.</p><p>5. To divide by the line of equal parts on the ſector. Extend the compaſſes laterally from the beginning of the line to 1, and open the ſector till you fit that extent to the parallel of the diviſor; then take the parallel diſtance of the dividend, which extent, meaſured in a lateral direction, will give the quotient required. Thus, ſuppoſe it was required to divide 36 by 4; extend the compaſſes laterally, the beginning of the line to r, and fit to that extent the parallel of 4, the diviſor; then extend the compaſſes parallel, from 36 on one leg to 36 on the other, and that extent, meaſured laterally, will give 9, the quotient required.</p><p>6. Proportion by the line of equal parts. Make the lateral diſtance of the ſecond term the parallel diſtance of the firſt term, the parallel diſtance of the third term is the fourth proportional. <hi rend="italic">Example.</hi> To find a fourth proportional to 8, 4, and 6, take the lateral diſtance of 4, and make it the parallel diſtance of 8; then the parallel diſtance of 6, extended from the centre, ſhall reach to the fourth proportional 3.</p><p>In the ſame manner, a third proportional is found to two numbers. Thus, to find a third proportional to 8 and 4, the ſector remaining as in the former example, the parallel diſtance of 4, extended from the centre, ſhall reach to the third proportional 2. In all theſe caſes, if the number to be made a parallel diſtance be too great for the ſector, ſome aliquot part of it is to be taken, and the anſwer is to be multiplied by the number by which the firſt number was divided.</p><p>Use <hi rend="italic">of the Line oſ Chords on the</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sector.</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">1.</hi> To open the ſector ſo as the two lines of chords may make an angle or number of degrees, ſuppoſe 40. Take the diſtance from the joint to 40, the number of the degrees propoſed, on the line of chords; open the ſector till the diſtance from 60 to 60, on each leg, be equal to the given diſtance of 40; then will the two lines on the ſector form an angle of 40 degrees, as was required.</p><p>2. The ſector being opened, to find the degrees of its aperture. Take the extent from 60 to 60, and lay it off on the line of chords from the centre; the number whereon it terminates will ſhow the degrees, &amp; c. required.</p><p>3. To lay off any number of degrees upon the circumference of a circle. Open the ſector till the diſtance between 60 and 60 be equal to the radius of the given circle; then take the parallel extent of the chord of the number of degrees on each leg of the ſector, and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0245.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0239"/>
lay it off on the circumference of the given circle.— Hence any regular polygon may be eaſily inſcribed in a given circle,</p><p>Use of th <hi rend="italic">e Line of Polygons on the</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sector.</hi> 1. To inſcribe a regular polygon in a given circle. Take the ſemidiameter of the given circle in the compaſſes, and adjuſt it to the number 6, on the line of polygons, on each leg of the ſector: then, the ſector remaining thus opened, take the diſtance of the two equal numbers, expreſſing the number of ſides the polygon is to have; <hi rend="italic">e. gr.</hi> the diſtance from 5 to 5 for a pentagon, from 7 to 7 for a heptagon, &amp; c. Theſe diſtances carried about the circumference of the circle, will divide it into ſo many equal parts.</p><p>2. To deſcribe a regular polygon, <hi rend="italic">e. gr.</hi> a pentagon, on a given right line. Take the length of the line in the compaſſes, and apply it to the extent of the number 5, 5, on the lines of polygons. The ſector thus opened, upon the ſame lines take the extent from 6 to 6; this will be the ſemidiameter of the circle the polygon is to be inſcribed in. If then, with this diſtance, from the ends of the given line, you deicribe two arches of a circle, their interſection will be the centre of the circle.</p><p>3. On a right line, to deſcribe an iſoceles triangle, having the angles at the baſe double that at the vertex. Open the ſector, till the ends of the given line fall on 10 and 10 on each leg; then take the diſtance from 6 to 6. This will be the length of the two equal ſides of the triangle.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Uſe of the Lines of Sines, Tangents, and Secants, on the</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sector.</hi> By the ſeveral lines diſpoſed on the ſector, we have ſcales to ſeveral radii; ſo that having a length or radius given, not exceeding the length of the ſector when opened, we find the chord, fine, &amp; c. thereto: <hi rend="italic">e. gr.</hi> Suppoſe the chord, fine, or tangent, of 10 degrees, to a radius of 3 inches required; make 3 inches the aperture, between 60 and 60, on the lines of chords of the two legs; then will the ſame extent reach from 45 to 45 on the line of tangents, and from 90 to 90 on the line of the ſines on the other ſide; ſo that to whatever radius the line of chords is ſet, to the ſame are all the others ſet. In this diſpoſition, therefore, if the aperture between 10 and 10, on the lines oſ chords, be taken with the compaſſes, it will give the chord of 10 degrees. If the aperture of 10 and 10 be in like manner taken on the lines of ſines, it will be the ſine of 10 degrees. Laſtly, if the aperture of 10 and 10 be in like manner taken on the lines of tangents, it gives the tangent of 10 degrees.</p><p>If the chord, or tangent, of 70 degrees were required; for the chord, the aperture of half the arch, viz. 35, muff be taken, as before; which diſtance, repeated twice, gives the chord of 70 degrees. To find the tangent of 70 degrees to the ſame radius, the ſmall line of tangents muſt be uſed, the other only reaching to 45: making, therefore, 3 inches the aperture between 45 and 45 on the ſmall line; the extent between 70 and 70 degrees on the ſame, will be the tangent of 70 degrees to 3 inches radius.</p><p>To find the ſecant of an arch, make the given radius the aperture between 0 and 0 on the lines of ſecants: then will the aperture of 10 and 10, or 70 and 70, on ſaid lines, give the tangent of 10⁰ or 70⁰.</p><p>If the converſe of any of theſe things were required, that is, if the radius be required, to which a given line is the ſine, tangent, or ſecant, it is but making the given line, if a chord, the aperture on the line of chords, between 10 and 10, and then the ſector will ſtand at the radius required; that is, the aperture between 60 and 60 on the ſaid line is the radius. If the given line were a line, tangent, or ſecant, it is but making it the aperture of the given number of degrees; then will the diſtance of 90 and 90 on the ſines, of 45 and 45 on the tangents, of 0 and 0 on the ſecants, be the radius.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Astronomical</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sector.</hi> See <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Astronomical</hi> <hi rend="italic">Sector.
