a ſolid ſweet subſtance obtained from the juice of the ſugar-cane ; or, according to chemiſts, an essential salt, capable of cryſtallization, of a ſweet and agreeable flavour, and contained in a greater or leſs quantity in almoſt every ſpecies of vegetables, but moſt abundant in the ſugar-cane.</p><p>As the ſugar-cane is the principal production of the West Indies, and the great ſource of their riches ; as it is ſo important in a commercial view, from the employment which it gives to ſeamen, and the wealth which it opens for merchants; and beſides is now become a neceſſary of life—it may juſtly be eſteemed one of the moſt valuable plants in the world. The quantity conſumed in Europe is eſtimated at nine millions Sterling, and the demand would probably be greater it it could be ſold at a reduced price. Since ſugar then is reckoned ſo precious a commodity, it must be an object of deſire to all perſons of curioſity and reſearch, to obtain ſome general knowledge of the hiſtory and nature of the plant by which it is produced, as well as to underſtand the proceſs by which the juice is extracted and refined. We will therefore firſt inquire in what countries it originally flouriſhed, and when it was brought into general uſe, and became an article of commerce.</p><p>From the few remains of the Grecian and Roman authors which have ſurvived the ravages of time, we can find no proofs that the juice of the ſugar-cane was known at a very early period.

concealed. It is not improbable that it was known to the ancient Jews ; for there is ſome reaſon to ſuppoſe, that the Hebrew word קנה, which occurs frequently in the Old Teſtament, and is by our tranſlators rendered ſometimes <hi rend="italic">calamus</hi> and ſometimes <hi rend="italic">ſweet-cane,</hi> does in fact mean the sugar-cane. The firſt paſſage in which we have obſerved it mentioned is Exod. xxx. 23. where Moſes is commanded to make an ointment with myrrh, cinnamon, kené, and caſſia. Now the kené does not appear to have been a native of Egypt nor of Judea; for in Jeremiah vi. 20. it is mentioned as coming from a fat country. “ To what purpoſe cometh there to me incenſe from Sheba and the ſweet-cane from a far country ?” This is not true of the calamus aromaticus, which grows ſpontaneouſly in the Levant, as well as in many parts of Europe. If the cinnamon mentioned in the paſſage of Exodus quoted above was true cinnamon, it muſt have come from the Eaſt Indies, the only country in the world from which cinnamon is obtained. There is no difficulty therefore in ſuppoſing, that the ſugar-cane was exported from the ſame country. If any credit be due to etymology, it confirms the opinion that kené denotes the ſugar-cane ; for the Latin word <hi rend="italic">canna</hi> and the Engliſh word <hi rend="italic">cane</hi> are evidently derived from it. It is also a curious fact, that sachar or <hi rend="italic">ſkeker</hi><note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*שבד</p></note> *, in Hebrew, ſignifies <hi rend="italic">inebriation,</hi> from which the Greek word σαϰχαρ “ ſugar ’ is undoubtedly to be traced.</p><p>The ſugar cane was firſt made known to the weſtern parts of the world by the conqueſts of Alexander the Great.

Oſbeck alſo found it in China in 1751. It may indeed have been tranſplanted from ſome other country ; but as it does not appear ſrom hiſtory that the inhabitants of Japan or China ever carried on any commerce with remote nations, it could only be conveyed from ſome neighbouring country. Marco Polo, a noble Venetian, who travelled into the Eaſt about the year 1250, found ſugar in abundance in Bengal. Vaſco de Gama, who doubled the Cape of Good Hope in 1497, relates, that a conſiderable trade in ſugar was then carried on in the kingdom of Calicut. On the authority of Dioſcorides and Pliny, too, we ſhould be diſpoſed to admit, that it is a native of Arabia, did we not find, on conſulting Niebuhr’s Travels, that that botaniſt has omitted it when enumerating the moſt valuable plants of that country. If it be a ſpontaneous production of Arabia, it muſt ſtill flouriſh in its native soil. Mr Bruce found it in Upper Egypt. If we may believe the relation of Giovan Lioni, a conſiderable trade was carried on in ſugar in Nubia in 1500 : it abounded alſo at Thebes, on the Nile, and in the northern parts of Africa, about the ſame period.</p><p>There is reaſon to believe that the ſugar-cane was introduced into Europe during the crusades ; expeditions which however romantic in their plan, and unſucceſsful in their execution, were certainly productive of many advantages to the nations of Europe. Albertus Aquenſis, a monkiſh writer, obſerves, that the Chriſtian ſoldiers in the Holy Land frequently derived refreſhment and ſupport during a ſcarcity of proviſions by ſucking the canes. This plant flouriſhed alſo in the Morea, and in the iſlands of Rhodes and Malta ; from which it was tranſported into Sicily. The date of this tranſaction it is not eaſy to aſcertain ; but we are ſure that ſugar was cultivated in that iſland previous to the year 1166 ; for Lafitau the Jeſuit, who wrote a hiſtory of the Portugueſe diſcoveries, mentions a donation made that year to the monaſtery of St Bennet, by William the ſecond king of Sicily, of a mill for grinding ſugar-canes, with all its rights, members, and appurtenances.</p><p>From Sicily, where the ſugar-cane ſtill flouriſhes on the ſides of mount Hybla, it was conveyed to Spain, Madeira, the Canary and Cape de Verd iſlands, ſoon after they were diſcovered in the 15th century<note anchored="true" n="9" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Tom. iii. c. xv.</p></note>.</p><p>An opinion has prevailed, that the ſugar-cane is not a native of the weſtern continent, or its adjacent iſlands the West Indies, but was conveyed thither by the Spaniards or Portugueſe ſoon after the diſcovery of America by Columbus. From the teſtimony of Peter Martyr, in the third book of his firſt decade, compoſed during Columbus’s ſecond voyage, which commenced in 1493 and ended in 1497, it appears, that the ſugar-cane was known at that time in Hiſpaniola. It may be ſaid, that it was brought thither bv Columbus ; but for this aſſertion we have found no direct evidence; and though we had direct evidence, this would not prove that ths ſugar-cane was not an indigenous plant of the West Indies. There are authors of learning who, after inveſtigating this ſubject with attention, do not hesitate to maintain, that it is a native both of the iſlands and of the continentof America.</p><p>P. Labat has ſupported this opinion with much appearance of truth<note anchored="true" n="10" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> For a more minute account of the hiſtory of ſugar in the early and middle ages, a paper of the Mancheſter Transactions, in Volume IV., by Dr Falconer, may be consulted.</p></note> *; and, in particular, he appeals to the teſtimony of Thomas Gage, an Engliſhman, who viſited New Spain in 1625. Gage enumerates sugar-canes among the proviſions with which the Charaibes of Guadaloupe ſupplied his ſhip. “ Now (ſays Labat) it is a fact that the Spaniards had never cultivated an inch of ground in the Smaller Antilles. Their ſhips commonly touched at thoſe iſlands indeed ſor wood and water ; and they left swine in the view of ſupplying with freſh proviſions such of their countrymen as might call there in future ; but it would be abſurd in the<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0062.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0056"/>
higheſt degree to ſuppose, that they would plant ſugar- canes, and at the ſame time put hogs aſhore to deſtroy them.</p><p>‘‘ Neither had the Spaniards any motive for beſtowing this plant on iſlands which they conſidered as of no kind of importance, except for the purpoſe that has been mentioned ; and to ſuppoſe that the Charaibes might have cultivated, after their departure, a production of which they knew nothing, betrays a total ignorance of the Indian diſpoſition and character.</p><p>" But (continues Rabat) we have ſurer teſtimony, and ſuch as proves, beyond all contradiction, that the ſugar-cane is the natural production of America. For, beſides the evidence of Francis Ximines, who, in a Treatiſe on American Plants, printed at Mexico, asserts, that the ſugar-cane grows without cultivation, and to an extraordinary ſize, on the banks of the river Plate, we are aſſured by Jean de Lery, a Proteſtant miniſter, who was chaplain in 1556 to the Dutch garriſon in the fort of Coligny, on the river Janeiro, that he himſelf found ſugar-canes in great abundance in many places on the banks of that river, and in ſituations never viſited by the Portugueſe. Father Hennepen and other voyagers bear teſtimony in like manner to the growth of the cane near the mouth of the Miſſiſſippi ; and Jean de Laet to its ſpontaneous production in the iſland of St Vincent. It is not for the plant itſelf, therefore, but for the ſecret of making ſugar from it, that the West Indies are indebted to the Spaniards and Portugueſe ; and theſe to the nations of the eaſt.”</p><p>Such is the reaſoning of Labat, which the learned Lasitau has pronounced incontrovertible ; and it is greatly strengthened by recent discoveries, the ſugar-cane having been found in many of the iſlands of the Pacific Ocean by our late illuſtrious navigator Captain Cook.</p><p>The ſugar-cane, or ſaccharum officinarum of botaniſts, is a jointed reed, commonly measuring(the flag part not included) from three feet and a half to ſeven feet in height, but ſometimes rising to 12 feet. When ripe it is of a fine ſtraw colour inclining to yellow, producing leaves or blades, the edges of which are finely and ſharply ſerrated, and terminating in an arrow decorated with a panicle. The joints in one ſtalk are from 40 to 60 in number, and the ſtalks riling from one root are ſometimes very numerous. The young ſhoot aſcends from the earth like the point of an arrow ; the ſhaſt of which ſoon breaks, and the two firſt leaves, which had been incloſed within a quadruple (heath of seminal leaves, rise to a conſiderable height<note anchored="false" n="11" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Edward's History of the West Indies, vol. ii.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(b).</hi> See Plate CCCCLXXXVI. M is the arrow and N the lower part with the root.</p><p>As the cane is a rank ſucculent plant, it muſt require a strong deep ſoil to bring it to perfection, perhaps indeed no soil can be too rich for this purpoſe. The ſoil which experience has found to be moſt favourable to the cultivation of it in the West Indies is the dark grey loam of St Chriſtopher’s, which is ſo light and porous as to be penetrable by the ſlighteſt application of the hoe. The under ſtratum is gravel from 8 to 12 inches deep. Canes planted in particular ſpots in this iſland have been known to yield 8000 pounds of Muſcovado ſugar from a ſingle acre. The average produce of the iſland for a ſeries of years has been 16,000 hogsheads of 16 cwt, which is one-half only of the whole cane-land, or 8500 acres. When annually cut, it gives nearly two hogsheads of 16 cwt. per acre for the whole of the land in ripe canes.</p><p>Next to the ashy loam of St Chriſtopher’s is the ſoil which in Jamaica is called <hi rend="italic">brick-mold;</hi> not as reſembling a brick in colour, but as containing ſuch a due mixture of clay and sand as is suppoſed to render it well adapted for the uſe of the kiln. It is a deep, warm, and mellow, hazel earth, eaſily worked; and though its ſurface ſoon grows dry after rain, the under ſtratum retains a conſiderable degree of rnoiſture in the drieſt weather ; with this advantage too, that even in the wetteſt ſeaſon it ſeldom requires trenching. Plant caries, by which is meant canes of the firſt growth, have been known in very fine ſeaſons to yield two tons and a half oſ ſugar per acre. After this may be reckoned the black mold of ſeveral varieties.<note anchored="true" n="12" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi> “A field of canes, when standing, in the month of November, when it is in arrow or full bloſſom (ſays Mr Beckford in his deſcriptive Account of the Iſland of Jamaica), is one of the moſt beautiful productions that the pen or pencil can poſſibly deſcribe. It in common riſes from three to eight feet or more in height ; a difference of growth that very strongly marks the difference of ſoil or the varieties of culture. It is when ripe of a bright and golden yellow ; and where obvious to the ſun, is in many parts very beautifully ſtreaked with red : the top is of a darkish green ; but the more dry it becomes, from either an excess of ripeneſs or a continuance oſ drought, of a ruſſet yellow, with long and narrow leaves depending ; from the centre of which ſhoots up an arrow like a ſilver wand from two to six feet in height; and from the ſummits of which grows out a plume of white feathers, which are delicately fringed with a lilac dye ; and indeed is, in its appearance, not much unlike the tuft that adorns this particular and elegant tree.”</p></note> The beſt is the deep black earth of Barbadoes, Antigua, and ſome other of the windward iſlands ; but there is a ſpecies of this mold in Jamaica that is but little, if any thing inferior to it, which abounds with limeſtone and flint on a ſubſtratum of ſoapy marle. Black mold on clay is more common ; bnt as the mold is generally ſhallow, and the clay ſtiff and retentive of water, this laſt sort of land requires great labour, both in ploughing and trenching, to render it profitable. When manured and properly pulverized, it becomes very productive. It is unneceſſary to attempt a minute deſcription of all the other ſoils which are found in theſe iſlands. There is, howcver, a peculiar sort of land on the north side of Jamaica, chiefly in the pariſh of Trelawney, that cannot be paſſed over unnoticed, not only on account of its ſcarcity but its value ; few ſoils producing finer ſugars, or ſuch <hi rend="italic">as anſwer ſo well in the pan ;</hi> an expreſſion ſignifying a greater return of refined ſugar than common. The land alluded to is generally of a red colour; the ſhades of which, however, vary conſiderably from a deep chocolate to a rich scarlet; in ſome places it approaches to a bright yellow, but it is everywhere remarkable, when firſt turned up, for a gloſſy or ſhining ſurface, and if wetted ſtains the fingers like paint.</p><p>As in every climate there is a ſeaſon more favourable for vegetation than others, it is of great importance that plants for ſeed be committed to the ground at the commencement of this ſeaſon. As the cane requires a great deal of moiſture to bring it to maturity, the propereſt ſeaſon for planting it is in the months of September and October, when the autumnal rains commence, that it may be ſufficiently luxuriant to ſhade the ground before the dry weather ſets in. Thus the root is kept moiſt, and the crop is ripe for the mill in the beginning of the enſuing year. Canes planted in the month of November, or later in the ſeaſon, lose the advantage of the autumnal rains ; and it often happens that dry weather in the beginning of the enſuing year retards their vegetation until the vernal or May rains ſet in, when they ſprout both at the roots and the joints ; ſo that<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0063.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0057"/>
by the time they arc cut the field is loaded with unripe suckers inſtead of sugar-canes. A January plant, however, commonly turns out well ; but canes planted very late in the ſpring, though they have the benefit of the May rains, ſeldom anſwer expectation ; for they generally come in unſeaſonably, and throw the enſuing crops out of regular rotation. They are therefore frequently cut before they are ripe ; or if the autumnal ſeaſons ſet in early, are cut in wet weather, which has probably occaſioned them to ſpring a- freſh ; in either case the effect is the ſame : The juice is unconcocted, and all the sap being in motion, the root is deprived of its natural nouriſhment, to the great injury of the ratoon. The chief objection to a fall plant is this, that the canes become rank and top heavy, at a period when violent rains and high winds are expected, and are therefore frequently lodged before they are fit to be cut.</p><p>The ſugar-cane is propagated by the top-ſhoots, which are cut from the tops of the old canes. The uſual method of planting in the West Indies is this : The quantity of land intended to be planted, being cleared of weeds and other incumbrances, is firſt divided into ſeveral plats of certain dimenſions, commonly from 15 to 20 acres each ; the ſpaces between each plat or diviſion are left wide enough for roads, for the conveniency of carting, and are called <hi rend="italic">intervals.</hi> Each plat is then ſubdivided, by means of a line and wooden pegs, into ſmall ſquares of about three feet and a half. Sometimes indeed the ſquares are a foot larger ; but this circumſtance makes but little difference. The negroes are then placed in a row in the firſt line, one to a ſquare, and directed to dig out with their hoes the ſeveral ſquares, commonly to the depth of five or six inches. The mold which is dug up being formed into a bank at the lower side, the excavation or cane-hole ſeldom exceeds 15 inches in width at the bottom, and two feet and a half at the top. The negroes then fall back to the next line, and proceed as before. Thus the ſeveral ſquares between each line are formed into a trench of much the ſame dimenſions with that which is made by the plough. An able negro will dig from 100 to 120 of theſe holes for his day’s work of ten hours ; but if the land has been previouſly ploughed and lain fallow, the ſame negro will dig nearly double the number in the ſame time<note anchored="false" n="13" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Edward's History of the West Indies, vol. ii.</p></note> (c).</p><p>The cane-holes or trench being now completed, whether by the plough or by the hoe, and the cuttings ſelected for planting, which are commonly the tops of the canes that have been ground for ſugar (each cutting containing five or six gems), two of them are ſufficient for a cane hole of the dimenſions deſcribed. Theſe, being placed longitudinally in the bottom of the hole, are covered with mold about two inches deep ; the rest of the bank being intended for future uſe. In 12 or 14 days the young ſprouts begin to appear ; and as ſoon as they rise a few inches above the ground, they are, or ought to be, carefully cleared of weeds, and furniſhed with an addition of mold from the banks. This is uſually performed by the hand. At the end of four or five months the banks are wholly levelled, and the ſpaces between the rows carefully hoe-ploughed. Frequent cleanings, while the canes are young, are indeed ſo eſſentially neceſſary, that no other merit in an overſeer can compenſate for the want of attention in this particular. A careful manager will remove at the ſame time all the lateral shoots or suckers that ſpring up after the canes begin to joint, as they ſeldom come to maturity, and draw nourishment from the original plants.</p><p>“ In the cultivation of other lands, in Jamaica eſpecially (says Mr Edwards, the elegant hiſtorian of the West Indies, whole ſuperior excellence has induced us frequently to refer to him in the course of this article), the plough has been introduced of late years, and in ſome few cales to great advantage ; but it is not every soil or ſituation that will admit the uſe of the plough ; ſome lands being much too ſtony, and others too ſteep ; and I am sorry I have occasion to remark, that a practice commonly prevails in Jamaica, on properties where this auxiliary is uſed, which would exhaust the fineſt lands in the world. It is that of ploughing, then croſs-ploughing, round-ridging, and harrowing the ſame lands from year to year, or at leaſt every other year, without affording manure : accordingly it is found that this method is utterly deſtructive of the ratoon or second growth, and altogether ruinous. It is indeed aſtoniſhing that any planter of common reading or obſervation ſhould be paſſive under ſo pernicious a syſtem. Some gentlemen, however, of late manage better : their practice is to break up ſtiff and clayey land, by one or two ploughings, early in the ſpring, and give it a ſummer’s fallow. In the autumn following, being then mellow and more eaſily worked, it is holed and planted by manual labour after the old method, which has been already deſcribed.<note anchored="true" n="14" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(C) As the negroes work at this business very unequally, according to their different degrees of bodily strength, it is sometimes the practice to put two negroes to a single square; but if the land has not had the previous assistance of the plough, it commonly requires the labour of 50 able negroes for 13 days to hole 20 acres. In Jamaica, some gentlemen, to ease their own slaves, have this laborious part of the planting-business performed by job-work. The usual price for holing and planting is L. 6 currency per acre (equal to L. 4, 7s. Sterling). The cost of falling and clearing heavy wood-land is commonly as much more.</p></note> But in truth, the only advantageous fyſtem of ploughing in the West Indies is to confine it to the ſimple operation of holing, which may certainly be performed with much greater facility and diſpatch by the plough than by the hoe ; and the relief which, in the caſe of ſtiff and dry soils, is thus given to the negroes, exceeds all eſtimation, in the mind of a humane and provident owner. On this ſubject I ſpeak from practical knowledge. At a plantation of my own, the greateſt part of the land which is annually planted is neatly and ſufficiently laid into caneholes, by the labour of one able man, three boys, and eight oxen, with the common ſingle-wheeled plough. The plough- ſhare indeed is ſomewhat wider than uſual ; but this is the only difference, and the method of ploughing is the ſimpleſt poſſible. By returning the plough back along the furrow, the turf is alternately thrown to the right and to the left, forming a trench ſeven inches deep, about two feet and a half wide at the top, and one foot wide at the bottom. A ſpace of 18 or 20 inches is left between each trench, on which the mold being thrown by the ſhare, the banks are properly formed, and the holing is complete. Thus the land is not exhauſted by being too much expoſed to the ſun ; and in this manner a field of 20 acres is holed with one plough, and with great eaſe, in 13 days. The plants are afterwards placed in the trench as in the common method, where manual labour alone is employed.</p><p>In moſt parts of the West Indies it is uſual to hole and plant a certain proportion of the cane-land, commonly one- third in annual rotation.

It is in vain to ſet traps for theſe creatures, however baited ; and the only way to protect the plantation, and deſtroy them, is to ſet a numerous watch, well armed with fowling-pieces, and furniſhed with dogs. The negroes will perform this service cheerfully, for they are very fond of monkeys as food.<note anchored="true" n="15" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(D)The account given in the text concerning the time when the ſugar-canes are collected, we have taken from the Abbé Raynal’s Hiſtory of the Trade and Settlements of the Eaſt and West Indies ; but Mr Cazaud obſerves, that in February, March, and April, all the canes, whatever be their age, are as ripe as the nature of the ſoil ever allows them to be. He says farther, that the dryneſs of the weather, and not the age of the canes, which increaſes from January to April, is the cauſe that in January 400 gallons of juice commonly yield 48 gallons of ſugar and molasses, one with another ; in February from 56 to 64 ; in March from 64 to 72 ; in April ſometimes 80 ; after which period the ſugar ferments, and even burns, when the refiner is not very expert at his business</p></note> The celebrated Father Labat ſays, they are very delicious, but the white inhabitants of St Kitt’s never eat them.</p><p>The low-land plantations ſuffer as much by rats as thoſe on the mountains do from monkeys ; but the rats, no more than the monkeys, are natives of the place ; they came with the ſhipping from Europe, and breed in the ground under looſe rocks and buſhes : the field negroes eat them greedily, and they are ſaid to be publicly sold in the markets at Jamaica. To free the plantations ſrom theſe vermin, the breed of wild cats ſhould be encouraged, and ſnakes ſuffered to multiply unmoleſted ; they may alſo be poiſoned with arſenic, and the raſped root of the caſſava made into pellets, and plentifully ſcattered over the grounds. This practice, however, is dangerous ; for as the rats when thus poiſoned become exceeding thirſty, they run in droves to the neighbouring ſtreams, which they poiſon as they drink, and the cattle grazing on the banks of theſe polluted waters have frequently periſhed by drinking after them : It is ſafer therefore to make the pellets of flour, kneaded with the juice of the night-ſhade, the ſcent of which will drive them away though they will not eat it. There is an Eaſt Indian animal called <hi rend="italic">mungoes,</hi> which bears a natural antipathy to rats; if this animal was introduced into qur ſugar iſlands, it would probably extirpate the whole race of theſe noxious vermin.

When this happens, the fine, broad, green blades become ſickly, dry, and withered ; ſoon after they appear ſtained in ſpots ; and if theſe ſpots are carefully examined, they will be found to contain innumerable eggs of an infect like a bug, which are ſoon quickened, and cover the plants with the vermin : the juice of the canes thus affected becomes sour, and no future ſhoot issues from the joints. Ants alſo concur with the bugs to spoil the plantation, and againſt theſe evils it is hard to find a remedy.</p><p>The crops of ſugar-canes do not ripen preciſely at the ſame period in all the colonies. In the Danish, Spaniſh, and Dutch ſettlements, they begin in January, and continue till October. This method doth not imply any fixed ſeaſon for the maturity of the ſugar-cane. The plant, however, like others, muſt have its progreſs ; and it hath been juſtly obſerved to be in flower in the months of November and December.<note anchored="false" n="16" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Grainger's History of the Sugar-Cane.</p></note> It muſt necessarily follow, from the cuſtom theſe nations have adopted of continuing to gather their crops for 10 months without intermiſſion, that they cut ſome canes which are not ripe enough, and others that are too ripe, and then the fruit hath not the requiſite qualities. The time of gathering them ſhould be at a fixed ſeaſon, and probably the months of March and April are the fitteſt for it ; becauſe all the ſweet fruits are ripe at that time, while the ſour ones do not arrive to a ſtate of maturity till the months of July and Auguſt.</p><p>The Engliſh cut their canes in March and April ; but they are not induced to do this on account of their ripeneſs. The drought that prevails in their iſlands renders the rains which fall in September neceſſary to their planting ; and as the canes are 18 months <hi rend="italic">in</hi> growing, this period always brings them to the preciſe point of maturity<note anchored="false" n="17" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Raynal's History of the East and West Indies, vol. iv.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(d).</hi></p><p>“ The time of crop in the ſugar iſlands (ſays Mr Edwards) is the ſeaſon of gladneſs and feſtivity to man and beaſt. So palatable, ſalutary, and nouriſhing, is the juice of the cane, that every individual of the animal creation, drinking freely of it, derives health and vigour from its uſe. The meagre and ſickly among the negroes exhibit a ſurpriſing alteration in a few weeks after the mill is ſet in action. The labouring horſes, oxen, and mules, though almoſt conſtantly at work during this ſeaſon, yet, being indulged with plenty of the green tops of this noble plant, and some of the ſcum- ιnings from the boiling-houſe, improve more than at any other period of the year. Even the pigs and poultry fatten on the refuſe. In ſhort, on a well-regulated plantation, under a humane and benevolent director, there is such an appearance during crop-time of plenty and buſy cheerfulneſs, as to ſoften, in a great meaſure, the hardſhips of ſlavery, and induce a ſpectator to hope, when the miſeries of life are repreſented as inſupportable, that they are sometimes exaggerated through the medium of fancy.”</p><p>The plants being cut, the branches at the top are given to the cattle for food; the top-ſhoot, which is full of eyes,<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0065.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0059"/>
is preſerved for planting. The canes are cut into pieces about a yard long, tied up in bundles, and carried in carts to the mill, where they are bruiſed, and the juice is extracted from them. The mill conſiſts principally of three upright iron-plated rollers or cylinders, from 30 to 40 inches in length, and from 20 to 25 inches in diameter ; and the middle one, to which the moving power is applied, turns the other two by means of cogs. Between theſe rollers, the canes (being previouſly cut ſhort, and tied into bundles) are twice compreiſed ; for having paſſed through the firſt and second rollers, they are turned round the middle one by a circular piece oſ frame-work or ſcreen, called in Jamaica the <hi rend="italic">Dumb- returner,</hi> and forced back through the ſecond and third ; an operation which ſqueezes them completely dry, and ſometimes even reduces them to powder. The cane juice is received in a leaden bed, and thence conveyed into a veſſel called the <hi rend="italic">receiver.</hi> The refuſe, or macerated rind of the cane (which is called <hi rend="italic">cane-trash,</hi> in contradiſtinction to <hi rend="italic">field-trash),</hi> ſerves for fuel to boil the liquor.</p><p>The juice as it flows from the mill, taken at a medium, contains eight parts of pure water, one part of sugar, and one part conſiſting of coarſe oil and mucilagious gum, with a portion of eſſential oil,</p><p>As this juice has a ſtrong diſpoſition to fermentation, it muſt be boiled as ſoon as poſſible. There are ſome watermills that will grind with great eaſe canes ſufficient for 30 hogſheads of ſugar in a week. It is neceſſary to have boiling veſſels, or clarifiers, that will correſpond in dimenſions to the quantity of juice flowing from the receiver. Theſe clarifiers are commonly three in number, and are ſometimes capable of containing 1000 gallons each ; but it is more uſual to ſee them of 300 or 400 gallons each. Besides the clarifiers which are uſed for the firſt boiling, there are generally four coppers or boilers. The clarifiers are placed in the middle or at one end of the boiling-houſe. If at one end, the boiler called the <hi rend="italic">teache</hi> is placed at the other, and ſeveral boilers (generally three) are ranged between them. The teache is ordinarily from 70 to 100 gallons, and the Boilers between the clarifiers and teache diminish in size from the firſt to the laſt. Where the clarifiers are in the middle, there is uſually a ſet of three boilers of each side, which constitute in effect a double boiling-houſe. On very large eſtates this arrangement is found uſeful and neceſſary. The objection to ſo great a number is the expence of fuel ; to obviate which, in ſome degree, the three boilers on each side of the clarifiers are commonly hung to one fire.</p><p>The juice runs from the receiver along a wooden gutter lined with lead into the boiling-houſe, where it is received into one of the clarifiers. When the clarifier is filled, a fire is lighted, and a quantity of Briſtol quicklime in powder, which is called <hi rend="italic">temper,</hi> is poured into the veſſel. The uſe of the lime is to unite with the ſuperabundant acid, which, for the ſucceſs of the proceſs, it is necessary to get rid of. The quantity ſufficient to ſeparate the acid muſt vary according to the ſtrength of the quicklime and the quality of the liquor. Some planters allow a pint of lime to every 100 gallons of liquor ; but Mr Edwards thinks that little more than half the quantity is a better medium proportion, and even then, that it ought to be diſſolved in boiling water, that as little of it as poſſible may be precipitated. The heat is ſuffered gradually to increaſe till it approaches within a few degrees of the heat of boiling water, that the impurities may be thoroughly separated. But if the liquor were suffered to boil with violence, the impurities would again incorporate with it. It is known to be ſufficiently heated when the ſcum begins to riſe in bliſters, which break into white froth, and appear generally in about 40 minutes. The fire is then ſuddenly extinguiſhed by means of a damper, which excludes the external air, and the liquor is allowed to remain about an hour undisturbed, during which period the impurities are collected in ſcum on the ſurface. The juice is then drained off either by a ſyphon or a cock ; the ſcum being of a tenacious gummy nature, does not flow out with the liquor, but remains behind in the clarifier. The liquid juice is conveyed from the clarifier by a gutter into the evaporating boiler, commonly termed the <hi rend="italic">grand copper ;</hi> and if it has been obtained from good canes it generally appears tranſparent.</p><p>In the evaporating boiler, which ſhould be large enough to receive the contents of the clarifier, the liquor is allowed to boil ; and as the ſcum riſes it is taken off. The ſcumming and evaporation are continued till the liquor becomes finer and thicker, and ſo far diminiſhed in bulk that it may be eaſily contained in the ſecond copper. When put into the ſecond copper, it is nearly of the colour of Madeira wine ; the boiling and ſcumming are continued, and if the impurities be conſiderable, a quantity of lime-water is added. This proceſs is carried on till the liquor be ſufficiently diminiſhed in quantity to be contained in the third copper.. After being purified a third time, it is put into the fourth copper, which is called the <hi rend="italic">teache,</hi> where it is boiled and evaporated till it is judged ſufficiently pure to be removed from the fire. In judging of the purity of the liquor, many of the negroes (ſays Mr Edwards) gueſs ſolely by the eye (which by long habit they do with great accuracy), judging by the appearance of the grain on the back of the ladle : but the practice moſt in uſe is to judge by what is called the <hi rend="italic">touch ; i.</hi> e. taking up with the thumb a ſmall portion of the hot liquor from the ladle ; and, as the heat diminiſhes, drawing with the fore-finger the liquid into a thread. This thread will ſuddenly break, and ſhrink from the thumb to the ſuſpended finger, in different lengths, according as the liquor is more or leſs boiled. The proper boiling height for ſtrong muſcovado ſugar is generally determined by a thread of a quarter of an inch long. It is evident, that certainty in this experiment can be attained only by long habit, and that no verbal precepts will furniſh any degree of ſkill in a matter depending wholly on constant practice.</p><p>The juice being thus purified by paſſing through the clarifier and four coppers, it is poured into coolers, which are uſually six in number. The removal from the teache to the cooler is called st <hi rend="italic">riking.</hi> The cooler is a ſhallow wooden veſſel 7 feet long, from 5 to 6 wide, about 11 inches deep, and capable of containing a hogſhead of ſugar. As the liquor cools, the ſugar grains, that is, collects into an irregular maſs of imperfect cryſtals, ſeparating itſelf from the melaſſes. It is then removed from the cooler, and conveyed to the curing houſe, where the melaſſes drain from it. For receiving them there is a large ciſtern, the doping sides of which are lined with boards. Directly above the ciſtern a frame of joiſt-work without boarding is placed, on which empty hogſheads without heads are ranged. The bottoms of theſe hogſheads are pierced with 8 or 10 holes, in each of which the ſtalk of a plantain leaf is fixed ſo as to project 6 or 8 inches below the joiſts, and riſe a little above the top of the hogſhead. The hogſheads being filled with the contents of the cooler, conſiſting of ſugar and melasses, the melaſſes being liquid, drain through the ſpungy ſtalk, and drop into the ciſtern. After the melaſſes are drained off, the ſugar becomes pretty dry and fair, and is then called <hi rend="italic">muſcovado</hi> or <hi rend="italic">raw ſugar.</hi></p><p>We have deſcribed the proceſs for extracting ſugar, which is generally adopted in the Britiſh West India iſlands, according to the lateſt improvements ; and have been anxious to preſent it to our readers in the ſimpleſt and moſt perſpicuous form, that it might be intelligible to every person ; and<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0066.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0060"/>
have therefore avoided to mention the obſervations and ρropoſed amendments of thoſe who have written on this ſubject. Had we done ſo, we ſhould have ſwelled the preſent article to too great a ſize, without accompliſhing the purpoſe which we have in view ; for our intention is not to inſtruct the planters, but to give a diſtinct account of the moſt approved methods which the planters have generally adopted. But though we judge it uſeless to trouble our readers with all the little varieties in the proceſs which different persons employ, we flatter ourſelves it will not be diſagreeable to learn by what methods the French make their ſugar purer and whiter than ours. A quantity of ſugar from the cooler is put into conical pans or earthen pots, called by the French <hi rend="italic">formes,</hi> having a ſmall perforation at the apex, which is kept cloſed. Each cone, reverſed on its apex, is ſupported in another earthen veſſel. The syrup is ſtirred together, and then left to cryſtallize. At the end of 15 or 16 hours, the hole in the point of each cone is opened, that the impure ſyrup may run out.<note anchored="false" n="18" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Chaptal's Chemistry, vol. iii.</p></note> The baſe of theſe ſugar loaves is then taken out, and white pulverized ſugar ſubſtituted in its ſtead ; which being well pressed down, the whole is covered with clay moiſtened with water. This water filters through the maſs, carrying the ſyrup with it which was mixed with the ſugar, but which by this management flows into a pot ſubſtituted in the place of the firſt. This ſecond fluid is called <hi rend="italic">fine ſyrup.</hi> Care is taken to moiſten and keep the clay to a proper degree of ſoftneſs as it becomes dry. The ſugar loaves are afterwards taken out, and dried in a ſtove for eight or ten days ; after which they are pulverized, packed, and exported to Europe, where they are still farther purified. The reaſon assigned why this proceſs is not univerſally adopted in the Britiſh ſugar iſlands is this, that the water which dilutes and carries away the molaſſes diſſolves and carries with it ſo much of the ſugar, that the difference in quality does not pay for the difference in quantity. The French planters probably think otherwiſe, upwards of 400 of the plantations of St Domingo having the neceſſary apparatus for claying and actually carrying on the ſyſtem.</p><p>The art of refining ſugar was firſt made known to the Europeans by a Venetian, who is ſaid to have received 100,000 crowns for the invention. This diſcovery was made before the new world was explored ; but whether it was an invention of the perſon who firſt communicated it, or whether it was conveyed from China, where it had been known for a conſiderable time before, cannot now perhaps be accurately aſcertained.<note anchored="false" n="19" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Anderson's Origin of Commerce.</p></note> We find no mention made of the refining of ſugar in Britain till the year 1659, though it probably was practiſed ſeveral years before. For in the Portugueſe iſland of St Thomas in 1624 there were 74 ſugar ingenios, each having upwards of 200 ſlaves. The quantity of raw ſugar imported into England in 1778 amounted to 1,403,995 cwts. ; the quantity imported into Scotland in the ſame year was 117,285 cwts. ; the whole quantity imported into Great Britain in 1787 was 1,026,741 cwts.</p><p>The ſugar which undergoes the operation of refining in Europe is either raw ſugar, ſometimes called <hi rend="italic">muscovado</hi> or saf <hi rend="italic">fonado,</hi> which is raw ſugar in a purer ſtate. The raw ſugar generally contains a certain quantity of melasses as well as earthy and seculent ſubſtances. The cassonado, by the operation of earthing, is freed from its melasses. As the intention of refining theſe ſugars is to give them a higher degree of whiteneſs and ſolidity, it is neceſſary for them to undergo other processes The firſt of theſe is called <hi rend="italic">clarification.</hi> It consiſts in diſſolving the ſugar in a certain proportion of lime-water, adding a proper quantity of bullock’s blood, and expoſing it to heat in order to remove the impurities which ſtill remain. The heat is increaſed very gradually till it approach that of boiling water.By the aſſiſtance of the heat, the animal matter which was thrown in coagulates, at the ſame time that it attracts all the ſolid feculent and earthy matter, and raiſes it to the ſurface in the appearance of a thick foam of a browniſh colour. As the seculencies are never entirely removed by a firſt proceſs, a ſecond is neceſſary. The ſolution is therefore cooled to a certain degree by adding ſome water ; then a freſh quantity of blood, but leſs conſiderable than at firſt, is poured in. The fire is renewed, and care is taken to in- creaſe the heat gently as before. The animal ſubſtance ſeizes on the impurities which remain, collects them on the ſurface, and they are then skimmed off The ſame operation is repeated a third and even a fourth time, but no addition is made to the liquor except water. If the different proceſſes have been properly conducted, the ſolution will be freed from every impurity, and appear tranſparent. It is then conveyed by a gutter into an oblong baſket about 16 inches deep, lined with a woollen cloth ; and after filtering through this cloth, it is received in a ciſtern or copper which is placed below.</p><p>The ſolution being thus clarified, it undergoes a ſecond general operation called <hi rend="italic">evaporation.</hi> Fire is applied to the copper into which the ſolution was received, and the liquid is boiled till it has acquired the proper degree of conſiſtency. A judgment is formed of this by taking up a ſmall portion of the liquid and drawing it into a thread. When, after this trial, it is found ſufficiently viſcous, the fire is extinguiſhed, and the liquid is poured into coolers. It is then ſtirred violently by an inſtrument called an <hi rend="italic">oar,</hi> from the reſemblance it bears to the oar of a boat. This is done in order to diminiſh the viſcoſity, and promote what is called the <hi rend="italic">granulation,</hi> that is, the forming of it into grains or imperfect cryſtals. When the liquid is properly mixed and cooled, it is then poured into moulds of the form of a ſugar loaf. Theſe moulds are ranged in rows. The ſmall ends, which are loweſt, are placed in pots ; and they have each of them apertures flopped up with linen for filtering the ſyrup, which runs from the moulds into the pots. The liquor is then taken out ſlowly in ladlefuls from the coolers, and poured into the moulds. When the moulds are filled, and the contents ſtill in a fluid ſtate, it is neceſſary to ſtir them; that no part may adhere to the moulds, and that the ſmall cryſtals which are juſt formed may be equally diffuſed thro’ the whole maſs. When the ſugar is completely cryſtallized; the linen is taken away from the apertures in the moulds’ and the ſyrup, or that part which did not cryſtallize, deſcends into the pots in which the moulds are placed. After this purgation the moulds are removed and fixed in other pots, and a ſtratum of fine white clay diluted with water is laid on the upper part of the loaf. The water deſcending thro’ the ſugar by its own weight, mixes with the ſyrup which ſtill remains in the body of the loaf, and waſhes it away. When the clay dries, it is taken off, and another covering cf moist clay put in its place ; and it it be not then sufficiently waſhed, a third covering of clay is applied. After the loaves have stood ſome days in the moulds, and have acquired a conſiderable degree of firmneſs and ſolidity, they are taken out, and carried to a ſtove, where they are gradually heated to the 50⁰ of Reaumur (64⁰ of Fahrenheit), <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> in order to diſſipate any moisture which may be ſtill confined in them. After remaining in the ſtove eight days, they are taken out ; and after cutting off all diſcolouring ſpecks, and the head it ſtill wet, they are wrapped in blue paper, and are ready for ſale. The several ſyrups collected’ during the different parts of the proceſs, treated in the same manner which we have juft deſcribed, afford ſugars of inferior quality ; and the laſt portion, which no longer affords, any ſugar, is sold by the name of melasse <hi rend="italic">s.</hi><pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0067.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0061"/>
The beauty of refined ſugar, when formed into loaves, conſiſts in whiteneſs, joined to a ſmallneſs of grain ; in being dry, hard, and ſomewhat tranſparent. The proceſs which we have deſcribed above refers to ſugar once refined ; but ſome more labour is neceſſary to produce double refined ſugar. The principal difference in the operation is this, the latter is clarified by white of eggs instead of blood, and freſh water in place of lime-water.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Sugar-candy</hi> is the true eſſence of the cane formed into large cryſtals by a flow proceſs. When the ſyrup is well clarified, it is boiled a little, but not ſo much as is done for the proof mentioned in the proceſs for making common ſugar. It is then placed in old moulds, having their lower ends stopped with linen, and crossed at little diſtances with ſmall twigs to retain the ſugar as it crystallizes. The moulds are then laid in a cool place. In proportion as the ſyrup cools cryſtals are formed. In about nine or ten days the moulds are carried to the stove, and placed in a pot ; but the linen is not removed entirely, ſo that the ſyrup falls down slowly in drops. When the ſyrup has dropped away, and the cryſtals of the ſugar-candy are become dry, the moulds are taken from the stove and broken in pieces, to diſengage the ſugar, which adheres strongly to the ſides of the moulds. If the ſyrup has been coloured with cochineal, the cryſtals take a slight taint of red ; if indigo has been mixed, they affirme a bluiſh colour. If it be deſired to have the candy perfumed, the eſſence of flowers or amber may be dropped into the moulds along with the ſyrup.</p><p>Having now given ſome account of the method uſually employed for refining ſugar, it will not be improper to ſay a few things concerning its nature and its uſes.</p><p>Sugar is ſoluble in water, and in a ſmall degree in alcohol. When united with a ſmall portion of water, it becomes fusible ; from which quality the art of preſerving is indebted for many of its preparations. It is phoſphoric and combustible ; when expoſed to fire emitting a blue flame if the combuſtion be flow, and a white flame if the combustion be rapid. By diſtillation it produces a quantity of phlegm, acid, oil, gas, and charcoal. Bergman, in treating ſugar with the nitrous acid, obtained a new acid now known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">oxalic add :</hi> but he has omitted to mention the principles of which ſugar is compoſed. Lavoiſier, however, has supplied this omission; and after many experiments has aſſigned three principles in ſugar, hydrogene, oxygene, and carbone. If the juice expreſſed from the ſugar-cane be left to itſelf, it passes into the acetous fermentation ; and during the decomposition of the ſugar, which is continued for three or four months, a great quantity of glutinous matter is ſeparated. This matter when diſtilled gives a portion of ammoniac. If the juice be expoſed to the ſpirituous fermentation, a wine is obtained analogous to cyder. If this wine, after being kept in bottles a year, be diſtilled, we obtain a portion of eau <hi rend="italic">de vie.</hi></p><p>The uſes to which ſugar are applied are indeed numerous and important : It can be made ſo ſolid as in the art of preſerving to receive the moſt agreeable colours and the greateſt variety of forms. It can be made ſo fluid as to mix with any ſoluble ſubſtance.— It preſerves the juice and ſubstance of fruits in all countries and in all ſeaſons. It affords a delicious seaſoning to many kinds of food. It is uſeful in pharmacy, for it unites with medicines, and removes their diſagreeable flavour : it is the baſis of all ſyrups. M. Macquer has ſhown in a very ſatisfactory manner how uſeful ſugar would be if employed in fermenting wines. Sugar has alſo been found a remedy for the ſcurvy, and a valuable article of food in cases of neceſſity. M. Imbert der Lennes, first surgeon to the late Duke of Orleans, publiſh the following story in the <hi rend="italic">Gazette de Sante,</hi> which confirms this affection. A veſſel laden with ſugar bound from the Weft Indies was becalmed in its paſſage for several days, during which the stock of proviſions was exhauſted. Some of the crew were dying of the ſcurvy, and the rest were threatened with a still more terrible death. In this emergency recourſe was had to the ſugar. The conſequence was, the ſymptoms of the ſcurvy went off, the crew found it a wholeſome and ſubſtantial aliment, and returned in good health to France.</p><p>“ Sugar (ſays Dr Ruſh) affords the greateſt quantity of nourishment in a given quantity of matter of any ſubſtance in nature; of courſe it may be preſerved in leſs room in our houſes, and may be conſumed in leſs time, than more bulky and leſs nouriſhing aliment. It has this peculiar advantage over moſt kinds of aliment, that it is not liable to have its nutritious qualities affected by time or the weather ; hence it is preferred by the Indians in their excursions from home<note anchored="false" n="20" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, vol. iii.</p></note>. They mix a certain quantity of maple ſugar, with an equal quantity of Indian corn, dried and powdered, in its milky ſtate. This mixture is packed in little baſkets, which are frequently wetted in travelling, without injuring the ſugar. A few ſpoonfuls of it mixed with half a pint of ſpring water afford them a pleaſant and strengthening meal. From the degrees of strength and nourishment which are conveyed into animal bodies by a ſmall bulk of ſugar, it might probably be given to horſes with great advantage, when they are uſed in places or under circumstances which make it difficult or expenſive to ſupport them with more bulky or weighty aliment. A pound of ſugar with graſs or hay has ſupported the strength and ſpirits of an horse during a whole day’s labour in one of the West India Islands. A larger quantity given alone has fattened horſes and cattle, during the war before last in Hiſpaniola, for a period of ſeveral months, in which the exportation of ſugar, and the importation of grain, were prevented by the want of ſhips.</p><p>“ The plentiful uſe of ſugar in diet is one of the best preventives that has ever been diſcovered of the diſeaſes which are produced by worms. Nature seems to have implanted a love for this aliment in all children, as if it were on purpoſe to defend them from thoſe diſeaſes. Dr Ruſh knew a gentleman in Philadelphia, who early adopted this opinion, and who, by indulging a large family of children in the uſe of ſugar, has preſerved them all from the diſeaſes uſually occaſioned by worms.</p><p>“ Sir John Pringle has remarked, that tire plague has never been known in any country where ſugar composes a material part of the diet of the inhabitants. Dr Ruſh thinks it probable that the frequency of malignant fevers of all kinds has been leſſened by this diet, and that its more general uſe would defend that claſs of people who are moſt subject to malignant fevers from being ſo often affected by them,</p><p>“ In the numerous and frequent disorders of the breaft, which occur in all countries where the body is expoſed to a variable temperature of weather, ſugar affords the baſis of many agreeable remedies. It is uſeful in weaknctſes; and acrid defluxions upon other parts of the body. Many facts might be adduced in favour of this aſſertion. Dr Ruſh mentions only one, which, from the venerable name of the perſon whoſe caſe furniſhed it, cannot fail of commanding attention and credit. Upon my inquiring of Dr Franklin, at the requeſt of a friend (says our reſpectable author), about a year before he died, whether he had found any relief from the pain of the stone from the blackberry jam, of which he took large quantities, he told me that he had, but that he believed the medicinal part of the jam reſided wholly in the ſugar ; and as a reaſon for thinking ſo, he added, that he often found the ſame relief by taking about half a pint of a<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0068.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0062"/>
syrup, prepared by boiling a little brown ſugar in water, juſt before he went to bed, that he did from a doſe of opium. It has been ſuppoſed by ſome of the early phyſicians of our country, that the ſugar obtained from the maple-tree is more medicinal than that obtained from the West India ſugar- cane ; but this opinion I believe is without foundation. It is preferable in its qualities to the Weſt India ſugar only from its superior cleanliness.</p><p>" Cases may occur in which ſugar may be required in medicine, or in diet, by perſons who refuse to be benefited, even indirectly by the labour of ſlaves. In such cases the innocent maple ſugar will always be preferred. It has been ſaid, that ſugar injures the teeth ; but this opinion now has ſo few advocates, that it does not deserve a ſerious refutation.”</p><p>In the account which we have given above of the method of cultivating and manufacturing ſugar, we have had in our eye the plantations in the West Indies, where ſlaves alone are employed ; but we feel a peculiar pleaſure in having it in our power to add a ſhort deſcription of the method uſed in the Eaſt Indies, becauſe there ſugar is manufactured by free men, on a plan which is much more economical than what is followed in the West-Indies. The account which we mean to give is an extract from the report of the committee of Privy-council for trade on the ſubject of the African ſlave- trade, drawn up by Mr Botham. We ſhall give it in the author’s own words.</p><p>“ Having been for two years in the Engliſh and French Weſt-Indian iſlands, and ſince conducted ſugar eſtates in the East-Ιndies ; before the abolition of the ſlave-trade was agitated in parliament, it may be deſirable to know that ſugar of a superior quality and inferior price to that in our iſlands is produced in the Eaſt-Indies; that the culture of the cane, the manufacture of the ſugar and arrack, is, with theſe material advantages, carried on by free people. China, Bengal, the coaſt of Malabar, all produce quantities of ſugar and ſpirits ; but as the moſt conſiderable growth of the cane is carried on near Batavia, I ſhall explain the improved manner in which ſugar eſtates are there conducted. The proprietor of the eſtate is generally a wealthy Dutchman, who has erected on it ſubſtantial mills, boiling and curing houſes. He rents this eſtate to a Chineſe, who reſides on it as a ſuperintendant ; and this renter (ſuppoſing the eſtate to conſiſt of 3c0 or more acres) relets it to freemen in parcels of 50 or 60 on theſe conditions : “ That they ſhall plant it in canes, and receive ſo much <hi rend="italic">per</hi> pecul of 133 ½ pounds for every pecul of ſugar that the canes ſhall produce.”</p><p>When crop time comes on, the ſuperintendant collects a sufficient number of perſons from the adjacent towns or villages, and takes off his crop as follows. To any ſet of tradeſmen who bring their carts and buffaloes he agrees to give ſuch a price <hi rend="italic">per</hi> pecul to cut all his crop of canes, carry them to the mill and grind them. A second to boil them <hi rend="italic">per</hi> pecul. A third to clay them and baſket them for market <hi rend="italic">per</hi> pecul. So that by this method of conducting a ſugar eſtate the renter knows to a certainty what the produce of it will coſt him <hi rend="italic">per</hi> pecul. He has not any permanent or unnecessary expence ; for when the crop is taken off, the taſkmen return to their ſeveral purſuits in the towns and villages they came from ; and there only remains the cane planters who are preparing the next year’s crop. This like all other complex arts, by being divided into ſeveral branches, renders the labour cheaper and the work more perfectly done.</p><p>Only clayed ſugars are made at Batavia; theſe are in quality equal to the beſt sort from the West Indies, and are sold ſo low from the ſugar eſtates as eighteen ſhillings ſterling <hi rend="italic">per pe</hi> cul of 133 ½ lbs. This is not the selling price to the trader at. Batavia, as the government there is arbitrary, and ſugar subject to duties impeded at will. The Shabander exacts a dollar <hi rend="italic">per</hi> pecul on all ſugar exported. The price of common labour is from 9d to 10d <hi rend="italic">per</hi> day. By the method of carrying on the ſugar eſtates, the taſkmen gain conſiderably more than this not only from working extraordinary hours, but from being conſidered artiſts in their ſeveral branches. They do not make ſpirits on the ſugar eſtates. The melasses is font for ſale to Batavia, where one diſtillery may purchaſe the produce of an hundred eſtates. Here is a vaſt ſaving and reduction of the price of ſpirits ; not as in the West Indies, a diſtillery, for each eſtate ; many centre in one, and arrack is sold at Batavia from 21 to 25 rix- dollars per leaguer of 160 gallons ; say 8d <hi rend="italic">per</hi> gallon.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sugar Maple,</hi> (the <hi rend="italic">acer ſaccharinum</hi> of Linnæus), as well as the ſugar-cane, produces a great quantity of ſugar. This tree grows in great numbers in the weſtern counties of all the middle ſtates of the American union. Thoſe which grow in New York and Pennſylvania yield the ſugar in a greater quantity than thoſe which grow on the waters of Ohio—Theſe trees are generally found mixed with the beech, hemlock, white and water aſh, the cucumber-tree, linden, aſpen, butter nut, and wild cherry trees. They ſometimes appear in groves covering live or six acres in a body, but they are more commonly interſperſed with ſome or all of the foreſt trees which have been mentioned.<note anchored="false" n="21" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Transactions of the American Philosophical Society, vol iii.</p></note> From 30 to 50 trees are generally found upon an acre of ground. They grow only in the richeſt ſoils, and frequently in ſtony ground. Springs of the purest water abound in their neighbourhood. They are, when fully grown, as tall as the white and black oaks, and from two to three feet in diameter. They put forth a beautiful white bloſſom in the ſpring before they ſhow a ſingle leaf. The colour of the blossom diſtinguiſhes them from the acer rubrum, or the common maple, which affords a blossom of a red colour. The wood of the ſugar maple-tree is extremely inflammable, and is preferred upon that account by hunters and ſurveyors for firewood. Its ſmall branches are ſo much impregnated with ſugar as to afford ſupport to the cattle, horſes, and ſheep of the firſt ſettlers, during the winter, before they are able to cultivate forage for that purpoſe. Its aſhes afford a great quantity of potaſh, exceeded by few, or perhaps by none, of the trees that grow in the woods of the United States. The tree is ſuppoſed to arrive at its full growth in the woods in twenty years.</p><p>It is not injured by tapping ; on the contrary, the oftener it is tapped, the more syrup is obtained from it. In this respect it follows a law of animal ſecretion. A ſingle tree had not only ſurvived, but flouriſhed after forty-two tappings in the same number of years. The effects of a yearly discharge of lap from the tree, in improving and increaſing the ſap, are demonſtrated from the ſuperior excellence of thoſe trees which have been perforated in an hundred places, by a ſmall wood-pecker which feeds upon the ſap. The trees, after having been wounded in this way, diſtil the remains of their juice on the ground, and afterwards acquire a black colour. The ſap of theſe trees is much ſweeter to the taſte than that which is obtained from trees which have not been previouſly wounded, and it affords more ſugar.</p><p>From twenty-three gallons and one quart of ſap, procured in twenty-four hours from only two of theſe dark coloured trees, Arthur Noble, Eſq; of the ſtate of New York, obtained four pounds and thirteen ounces of good grained ſugar.</p><p>A tree of an ordinary ſize yields in a good ſeaſon from twenty to thirty gallons of ſap, from which are made from five to six pounds of sugar. To this there are ſometimes remarkable exceptions. Samuel Lowe, Eſq; a juſtice of<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0069.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0063"/>
peace in Montgomery county, in the ſtate of New York, informed Arthur Noble, Eſq; that he had made twenty pounds and one ounce of ſugar between the 14th and 23d of April, in the year 1789, from a single tree that had been tapped for ſeveral ſucceſſive years before.</p><p>From the influence which culture has upon foreſt and other trees, it has been ſuppoſed, that by tranſplanting the ſugar maple-tree into a garden, or by deſtroying ſuch other trees as ſhelter it from the rays of the sun, the quantity of the sap might be increaſed, and its quality much improved. A farmer in Northampton county, in the ſtate of Pennſylvania, planted a number of theſe trees above twenty years ago in his meadow, from three gallons of the ſap of which he obtains every year a pound of ſugar. It was obſerved formerly, that it required five or six gallons of the ſap of the trees which grow in the woods to produce the ſame quantity of ſugar.</p><p>The ſap diſtils from the wood of the tree. Trees which have been cut down in the winter for the ſupport of the domeſtic animals of the new ſettlers, yield a considerable quantity of ſap as ſoon as their trunks and limbs feel the rays of the sun in the ſpring of the year. It is in conſequence of the ſap of theſe trees being equally diffuſed through every part of them, that they live three years after they are girdled, that is, after a circular inciſion is made through the bark into the ſubſtance of the tree for the purpoſe of deſtroying it. It is remarkable that graſs thrives better under this tree in a meadow, than in ſituations expoſed to the constant action of the ſun. The ſeaſon for tapping the trees is in February, March, and April, according to the weather which occurs in theſe months.</p><p>Warm days and froſty nights are moſt favourable to a plentiful diſcharge of ſap. The quantity obtained in a day from a tree is from five gallons to a pint, according to the greater or leſs heat of the air. Mr Lowe informed Arthur Noble, Eſq; that he obtained near three and twenty gallons of ſap in one day (April 14. 1789.) from the single tree which was before mentioned. Such inſtances of a profuſion of ſap in single trees are however not very common.</p><p>There is always a ſuſpenſion of the diſcharge of ſap in the night if a froſt ſucceed a warm day. The perforation in the tree is made with an axe or an auger. The latter is preferred from experience of its advantages. The auger is introduced about three quarters of an inch, and in an aſcending direction (that the ſap may not be frozen in a flow current in the mornings or evenings), and is afterwards deepened gradually to the extent of two inches. A ſpout is introduced about half an inch into the hole made by this auger, and projects from three to twelve inches from the tree. The ſpout is generally made of the ſumach or elder, which uſually grows in the neighbourhood of the ſugar trees. The tree is firſt tapped on the ſouth side ; when the diſcharge of its ſap begins to leſſen, an opening is made on the north ſide, from which an increaſed diſcharge takes place. The ſap flows from four to six weeks, according to the temperature of the weather. Troughs large enough to contain three or four gallons made of white pine, or white aſh, or of dried water aſh, aſpen, linden, poplar, or common maple, are placed under the ſpout to receive the ſap, which is carried every day to a large receiver, made of either of the trees before mentioned· From this receiver it is conveyed, after being ſtrained, to the boiler.</p><p>We underſtand that there are three modes of reducing the ſap to ſugar ; by evaporation, by freezing, and by boiling ; of which the latter is moſt general, as being the moſt expeditious. We are farther aſſured, that the profit of the maple tree is not confined to its ſugar. It affords moſt agreeable melaſſes, and an excellent vinegar. The ſap which is ſuitable for theſe purpoſes. is obtained after the ſap which affords the ſugar has ceaſed to flow, ſo that the manufactories of theſe different products of the maple-tree, by ſucceeding, do not interfere with each other. The melaſſes may be made to compoſe the basis of a pleaſant ſummer beer. The ſap of the maple is moreover capable of affording a ſpirit ; but we hope this precious juice will never be proſtituted to this ignoble purpoſe. Should the uſe of ſugar in diet become more general in this country (ſays Dr Ruſh), it may tend to leſſen the inclination or ſuppoſed neceſſity for ſpirits, for I have obſerved a reliſh for ſugar in diet to be ſeldom accompanied by a love for ſtrong drink.</p><p>There are ſeveral other vegetables raiſed in our own country which afford ſugar; as beet-roots, ſkirrets, parſneps, potatoes, celeri, red-cabbage ſtalks, the young ſhoots of Indian wheat. The ſugar is moſt readily obtained from theſe, by making a tincture of the ſubject in rectified ſpirit of wine ; which, when saturated by heat, will deposit the ſugar upon standing in the cold.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Sugar</hi> <hi rend="italic">of Milk.
