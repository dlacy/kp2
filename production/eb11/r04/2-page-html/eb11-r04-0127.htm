                    Caesar’s nominees, Antonius and Catiline, was mainly&nbsp;the work of the
                    Italian middle class, already&nbsp;rendered uneasy both by the rumours which
                    were&nbsp;rife of revolutionary schemes and of Caesar’s boundless&nbsp;ambition,
                    and by the numerous disquieting signs of disturbance noticeable in Italy. The
                    new consul vigorously&nbsp;set himself to discharge the trust placed in him. He
                    defeated the&nbsp;insidious proposals of Rullus for Caesar’s aggrandizement
                    and&nbsp;assisted in quashing the prosecution of Gaius Rabirius (q.v.).&nbsp;But
                    with the consular elections in the autumn of 63 a fresh&nbsp;danger arose from a
                    different quarter. The “ conspiracy of&nbsp;Catiline” (see </span><span
                    class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Catiline)</span><span
                    class="font1"> was not the work of the popular</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font1">party, and Still less was it an unselfish attempt at reform;
                    Catiline himself was a patrician, who had held high office, and&nbsp;possessed
                    considerable ability and courage; but he was bankrupt in character and in purse,
                    and two successive defeats in&nbsp;the consular elections had rendered him
                    desperate. To retrieve&nbsp;his broken fortunes by violence was a course which
                    was only&nbsp;too readily suggested by the history of the last forty
                    years,&nbsp;and materials for a conflagration abounded on all sides.
                    The&nbsp;danger to be feared from his intrigues lay in the state of
                    Italy,&nbsp;which made a revolt against society and the established government
                    only too likely if once a leader presented himself, and it&nbsp;was such a
                    revoIt that Catiline endeavoured to organize. Bankrupt nobles like himself,
                    Sullan veterans and the starving&nbsp;peasants whom they had dispossessed of
                    their holdings, outlaws of&nbsp;every description, the slave population of Rome,
                    and the wilder&nbsp;herdsmen-slaves of the Apulian pastures, were all enlisted
                    under&nbsp;his banner, and attempts were even made to excite
                    disaffection&nbsp;among the newly conquered people of southern Gaul and
                    the&nbsp;warIike tribes who still cherished the memory of Sertorius
                    in&nbsp;Spain. In Etruria, the seat and centre of agrarian distress ·&nbsp;and
                    discontent, a rising actually took place headed by a Sullan&nbsp;centurion, but
                    the spread of the revolt was checked by Cicero’s&nbsp;vigorous measures.
                    Catiline fled from Rome, and died fighting&nbsp;with desperate courage at the
                    head of his motley force of old&nbsp;soldiers, peasants and slaves. His
                    accomplices in Rome were&nbsp;arrested, and, after an unavailing protest from
                    Caesar, the senate&nbsp;authorized the consuls summarily to put them to
                    death.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The CatiHnarian outbreak had been a blow to Caesar, whose schemes
                    it interrupted, but to Cicero it brought not only popularity and honour, but, as
                    he beHeved, the realization of his&nbsp;political ideal. But Pompey was now on
                    his way home, @@<sup>12</sup> and&nbsp;again as in 70 the political future
                    seemed to depend&nbsp;on the attitude which the successful general
                    would&nbsp;assume; Pompey himself looked simply to the attainment by the help of
                    one political party or another of&nbsp;his immediate aims, which at present were
                    the ratification&nbsp;of his arrangements in Asia and a grant of land for his
                    troops.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">It was the impracticable jealousy of his personal rivals in the
                    senate, aided by the versatility of Caesar, who presented himself not as his
                    rival but as his ally, which drove Pompey once&nbsp;more, in spite of Cicero’s
                    efforts, into the camp of&nbsp;what was still nominally the popular party. In
                    60,&nbsp;on Caesar’s return from his propraetorship in Spain, the&nbsp;coalition
                    was formed which is known by the somewhat&nbsp;misleading title of the First
                    Triumvirate. @@<sup>13</sup> Pompey&nbsp;was ostensibly the head of this new
                    alliance, and in&nbsp;return for the satisfaction of his own demands he
                    undertook to support Caesar’s candidature for the consulship. The&nbsp;wealth
                    and influence of Crassus were enlisted in the same&nbsp;cause, and the
