(Sir Henry), an eminent Engliſh antiquarian, was deſcended from an ancient family, and born at Cengham, near Lynn in Norfolk, about the year 1561. He was knighted by king James I. who had a particular eſteem for him on account of his known capacity for buſineſs ; and he employed him ſeveral times in Ireland on public affairs. When he was about 50 years of age, he went to reſide in London ; where falling into a ſtudy to which his own genius had always inclined him, he collected all ſuch books and MSS. as concerned the ſubject of antiquities, either foreign or domeſtic. In 1626, he publiſhed the firſt part of his well-known Gloſſary, which he never carried beyond the letter L ; becauſe, as ſome have ſuggeſted, he had ſaid things under “ Magna charta,” and “ Maximum conſilium,” that could not then have appeared without giving offence. Upon his death all his papers came into the hands of his son Sir John Spelman, a gentleman who had abilities to have completed his father’s deſign, if death had not prevented him. The second part was afterwards publiſhed by Sir William Dugdale ; but with all the marks of a ſcanty unfiniſhed performance. The next work he entered upon was an edition of the Engliſh Councils, of which he publiſhed the firſt volume about two years before his death, leaving the second volume, as well of this as of his Gloſſary, to be publiſhed by Sir William Dugdale. Sir Henry wrote ſeveral other things, all relating to ancient laws and cuſtoms, and died in 1641. His Poſthumous Works were publiſhed in folio, 1698, under the inſpection of Mr Gibson, afterwards biſhop of London.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
