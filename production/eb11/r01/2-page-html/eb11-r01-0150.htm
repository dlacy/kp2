<p><span class="font1">by rail S.W. of Karlsruhe. Pop. (1905) 14,404. The old palace of the margraves of Baden, a large Renaissance edifice&nbsp;in red sandstone, is now partly used for military purposes and&nbsp;contains a collection of pictures, antiquities and trophies from&nbsp;the Turkish wars. The chief manufactures are stoves, beer&nbsp;and tobacco. Until the end of the 17th century Rastatt was&nbsp;unimportant, but after its destruction by the French in 1689&nbsp;it was rebuilt on a larger scale by Louis William, margrave of&nbsp;Baden, the imperial general in the Turkish wars. It was then&nbsp;the residence of the margraves until 1771. The Baden revolution of 1849 began with a mutiny of soldiers at Rastatt in May&nbsp;1849, and ended here a few weeks later with the capture of the&nbsp;town by the Prussians. For some years Rastatt was one of&nbsp;the strongest fortresses of the German empire, but its fortifications were dismantled in 1890.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">See Schuster, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rastatt, die ehemalige badische Residenz und Bundesfestung</span><span class="font0"> (Lahr, 1902); and Lederle, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rastatt und seine Umgebung </span><span class="font0">(Rastatt, 1905).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rastatt has been the scene of two congresses. At the first congress, which was opened in November 1713, negotiations&nbsp;were carried on between France and Austria for the purpose&nbsp;of ending the war of the Spanish succession. These culminated&nbsp;in the treaty of Rastatt signed on the 7th of March 1714. The&nbsp;second congress, which was opened in December 1797, was&nbsp;intended to rearrange the map of Germany by providing compensation for those princes whose lands on the left bank of the&nbsp;Rhine had been seized by France. It had no result, however,&nbsp;as it was ended by the outbreak of the European war, but it&nbsp;had a sequel of some interest. As the three French representatives were leaving the town in April 1799 they were&nbsp;waylaid, and two of them were assassinated by some Hungarian&nbsp;soldiers. The origin of this outrage remains shrouded in&nbsp;mystery, but the balance of evidence seems to show that the&nbsp;Austrian authorities had commanded their men to seize the&nbsp;papers of the French plenipotentiaries in order to avoid damaging disclosures about Austria’s designs on Bavaria, and that&nbsp;the soldiers had exceeded their instructions. On the other&nbsp;hand, some authorities think that the deed was the work of&nbsp;French emigrants, or of the party in France in favour of war.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RASTELL (or Rastall), JOHN (d. 1536), English printer and author, was born in London towards the end of the 15th&nbsp;century. He is vaguely reported by Anthony à Wood to have&nbsp;been “educated for a time in grammaticals and philosophicals ”&nbsp;at Oxford. He became a member of Lincoln’s Inn, and&nbsp;practised successfully as a barrister. He was also M.P. for&nbsp;Dunheved, Cornwall, from 1529 to the time of his death. He&nbsp;began his printing business some time before 1516, for in his&nbsp;preface to the undated </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Liber Assisarum</span><span class="font1"> he announced the&nbsp;forthcoming publication of Sir A. Fitzherbcrt’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abbreυiamenlum&nbsp;librorum legum Anglorum,</span><span class="font1"> dated 1516. Among the works&nbsp;issued from the “ sygne of the meremayd at Powlysgate,”&nbsp;where he lived and worked from 1520 onwards, are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Mery&nbsp;Gestys of the Wydow Edyth</span><span class="font1"> (1525), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Dyaloge of Syr Thomas&nbsp;More</span><span class="font1"> (1529). The last of his dated publications was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fabyl's&nbsp;Ghoste</span><span class="font1"> (1533), a poem. In 1530 he wrote, in defence of the&nbsp;Roman doctrine of Purgatory, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A New Boke of Purgatory</span><span class="font1"> (1530),&nbsp;dialogues on the subject between “ Comyngs and Almayn a&nbsp;Christen man, and one Gyngemyn a Turke.” This was&nbsp;answered by John Frith in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Disputacion of Purgatorie.</span><span class="font1"> Rastell replied with an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apology againsl John Fryth,</span><span class="font1"> also answered&nbsp;by the latter. Rastell had married Elizabeth, sister of Sir&nbsp;Thomas More, with whose Catholic theology and political views&nbsp;he was in sympathy. More had begun the controversy with&nbsp;John Frith, and Rastell joined him in attacking the Protestant&nbsp;writer, who, says Foxe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Actes and Monuments,</span><span class="font1"> ed. G. Townsend,&nbsp;vol. V. p. 9), did so “ overthrow and confound ” his adversaries&nbsp;that he converted Rastell to his side. Separated from his&nbsp;Catholic friends, Rastell does not seem to have been fully&nbsp;trusted by the opposite party, for in a letter to Cromwell, written probably in 1536, he says that he had spent his time in upholding the king’s cause and opposing the pope, with the result&nbsp;that he had lost both his printing business and his legal practice,&nbsp;and was reduced to poverty. He was imprisoned in 1536,&nbsp;perhaps because he had written against the payment of tithes.&nbsp;He probably died in prison, and his will, of which Henry VIII.&nbsp;had originally been appointed an executor, was proved on&nbsp;the 18th of July 1536. He left two sons: William, noticed&nbsp;below, and John. The Jesuit, John Rastell (1532-1577), who&nbsp;has been frequently confounded with him, was no relation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rastell's best-known work is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Pastyme of People, the Chronycles of dyvers Realmys and most specially of the Realme of England </span><span class="font0">(1529), a chronicle dealing with English history from the earliest&nbsp;times to the reign of Richard III., edited by T. F. Dibdin in 1811.&nbsp;His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Expositiones terminorum legum Angliae</span><span class="font0"> (in French, translated&nbsp;into English, 1527; reprinted 1629, 1636, 1641, &amp;c., as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Termes&nbsp;de la Ley),</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Abbreviation of Statutis</span><span class="font0"> (1519), of which fifteen&nbsp;editions appeared before 1625, are the best known of his legal works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rastell was also the author of a morality play, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A new Interlude and a Mery of the 1111 Elements,</span><span class="font0"> written about 1519, which is no&nbsp;doubt the “ large and ingenious comedy ” attributed to him by&nbsp;Wood. The unique copy in the British Museum is incomplete,&nbsp;and contains neither the date nor the name of the author, identified with John Rastell on the authority of Bale, who catalogues&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Natura Naturata</span><span class="font0"> among his works, adding a Latin version of the&nbsp;first line of the piece. This interlude was printed in W. C. Hazlitt’s&nbsp;edition of Dodsley’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Old English Plays,</span><span class="font0"> by J. O. Halliwell-Phillipps&nbsp;for the Percy Soc. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Early English Poetry,</span><span class="font0"> vol. 22, 1848), and by Julius&nbsp;Fischer (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marburger Studien zur englischen Philologie,</span><span class="font0"> vol. v., 1903).&nbsp;See also an article on “ John Rastell and his Contemporaries ”&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliographica,</span><span class="font0"> vol. ii, 437 seq., by Mr. IL R. Plomer, who&nbsp;unearthed in the Record Office an account of a law-suit (1534-35)&nbsp;in connexion with Rastell's premises at the “ Mermaid.” For the&nbsp;books issued from his press see a catalogue by R. Proctor, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hand-Lists of English Printers</span><span class="font0"> (Bibliographical Soc., 1896).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RASTELL, WILLIAM (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font1">. 1508-1565), English printer and judge, son of the preceding, was born in London about 1508.&nbsp;At the age of seventeen he went to the university of Oxford,&nbsp;but did not take a degree, being probably called home to super-intend his father’s business. The first work which bears his&nbsp;own imprint was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Dyaloge of Sir Thomas More</span><span class="font1"> (1531), a reprint&nbsp;of the edition published by his father in 1529. He also brought&nbsp;out a few law-books, some poetry, an edition of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fabyan's&nbsp;Cronycle</span><span class="font1"> (1533), and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Apologye</span><span class="font1"> (1533) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Supplycacyοn of Soulys</span><span class="font1"> of his uncle Sir Thomas More. His office was&nbsp;“ in Fletestrete in saynt Brydys chyrche yarde.” He became&nbsp;a student at Lincoln’s Inn on 12th September 1532, and gave&nbsp;up the printing business two years later. In 1547 he was&nbsp;appointed reader. On account of his Catholic convictions he&nbsp;left England for Louvain; but upon the accession of Mary&nbsp;he returned, and was made serjeant-at-law and treasurer of&nbsp;Lincoln’s Inn in 1555. His patent as judge of the Queen’s&nbsp;Bench was granted on the 27th of October 1558. Rastell&nbsp;continued on the bench until 1562, when he retired to Louvain&nbsp;without the queen’s licence. By virtue of a special commission&nbsp;issued by the barons of the Exchequer on the occasion an&nbsp;inventory of his goods and chattels was taken. It furnishes&nbsp;an excellent idea of the modest nature of the law library (consisting of twenty-four works) and of the chambers of an&nbsp;Elizabethan judge (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Law Magazine,</span><span class="font1"> February 1844). He&nbsp;died at Louvain on the 27th of August 1565.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is difficult to distinguish between the books written by him and those by his father. The following are believed to be his: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;Collection of all the Statutes</span><span class="font0"> (1550), </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Table collected of the Yeares&nbsp;of the Kynges of Englande</span><span class="font0"> (1561), both frequently reprinted with&nbsp;continuations, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Collection of Entrees, of Declarations, &amp;c.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1566), also frequently reprinted. The entries are not of Rastell's&nbsp;own drawing, but have been selected from printed and MS. collections; their “pointed brevity and precision ” are commended by&nbsp;Story. He supplied tables or indexes to several law-books, and&nbsp;edited </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La novel natura brevium de Monsieur Anton. Fitzherbert&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1534) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Workes of Sir T. More in the English Tonge</span><span class="font0"> (1557).&nbsp;He is also stated to have written a life of Sir T. More, but it has not&nbsp;come down to us.</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
