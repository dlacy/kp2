It says,</p><p>Chapman endeavoured to discover whether or not the areas of the several transverse sections in well-constructed ships followed any law ; and if so, to find that law. For this purpose he calculated the areas of the sections of several ships ; and in order to make the numbers more convenient, he divided these areas by the breadth of the midship section ; then, at their respective stations on the drawing, setting off from the water-line, distances equal to the quotients, he traced a curve representing the areas. This curve he called the curve of sections. He then endeavoured to find the equation to the curve, or rather that of another curve which would coincide with this for the greatest length ; and he found, that if the power and parameter of a parabola were so determined as to allow that curve to pass through three given points of the curve of sections, the two curves would nearly coincide. In the fore-body the three points were taken ; one forward, one at the midship section, and one midway between. In the after-body the points were similarly situated. In some ships the exponent to the curve was higher in the after-body than in the fore-body, in some it was the same for both. It was also found that there w ere ships in which the curve of sections almost exactly agreed with the parabola, and these ships invariably bore excellent characters. Chapman consequently concluded, that if the areas of the several sections of a ship were made to follow the law of the abscissas of a parabola, a vessel possessing good sailing qualities might be formed, and the process of construction much simplified.</p><p>This account shows that the method is applicable to all sorts of constructions, as it only requires that the relative areas of the sections shall decrease from the midship section towards the extremities in a certain relation, which can be varied to infinity ; it is therefore equally useful in constructing the sharpest man-of-war as the fullest merchant-man.</p><p>Suppose a ship is found to answer well at some given water-line, AC (fig. 21). Let the areas of the transverse vertical sections be divided by some constant quantity, as, for instance, the breadth ; and suppose the distances <hi rend="italic">ab, cd,</hi> &amp;c. cqual to the quotients, to be set off on the respective sections from the water line; then a curve drawn through the points <hi rend="italic">b, d,</hi> &amp;c. will be the curve of sections. It will be found to be convex to the water-line at the extremities.</p><p>The order of the parabola which coincides for the greatest distance with this line may easily be found.</p><p>Let the general equation to the parabola be expressed by <hi rend="italic">y</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">n</hi><hi rend="italic"> — ax ;</hi> then it is always possible to determine <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and α, so that the parabola shall pass through two points besides the vertex. Any two points between <hi rend="italic">b</hi> and C may be taken, but it is evident that the farther apart the three points are taken, the longer will the parabola coincide with the line of sections. Of course, neither point may be in the convex part of the line of sections. It will be found that the point <hi rend="italic">g</hi> at the foremost frame, and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> in the middle between <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> are the points which should be taken.</p><p>Draw a tangent to the curve at the point <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> which will be parallel to the water-line ; then <hi rend="italic">mb</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ng</hi> are abscissas, <hi rend="italic">bm</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bn</hi> ordinates to a parallel passing through <hi rend="italic">b, h,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">g ;</hi> put <hi rend="italic">mh — x', ng — xl', bm — g</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">,</hi><hi rend="italic">,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bn</hi> = y' ; then, substituting these values in the equation to the parabola, we have</p><p><hi rend="italic">y'</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">n</hi><hi rend="italic"> = ax',</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y'</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">h,</hi><hi rend="italic"> — ax", </hi>or <hi rend="italic">n</hi> log. <hi rend="italic">y' —</hi> log. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> + log. <hi rend="italic">xf</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">t</hi> and <hi rend="italic">n</hi>log. <hi rend="italic">y'' =</hi> log. <hi rend="italic">a</hi> + log. x" ; ,	log. <hi rend="italic">x' —</hi> log. x"</p><p>hence <hi rend="italic">n = </hi><hi rend="italic subscript">τ</hi><hi rend="italic">-≡—-.	</hi><hi rend="italic subscript">5</hi><hi rend="italic">-</hi><hi rend="italic superscript">s</hi><hi rend="italic">-&gt;</hi></p><p>log. y —log. y<hi rend="superscript">r </hi>_y <hi rend="superscript">α-</hi> «"</p><p>and log. <hi rend="italic">a =</hi></p><p><hi rend="superscript">o</hi>	h&gt;g∙ y — ι°g∙ y</p><p>We have now the values of <hi rend="italic">n</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x,</hi> and by calculating several other abscissas, we can trace the parabolic curve. The same operation applied to the after-body will give the exponent and parameter of the parabola, which is the most similar to the curve of sections in that body.</p><p>It generally happens that the exponents are nearly the same in both bodies, if the place of the midship section be determined in the manner to be shown in the sequel.</p><p>It will be found that the parabola and the line of sections very nearly coincide, the former being sometimes a little within the latter between <hi rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and without at the foreside of <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> and sometimes, but much more seldom, the contrary. The parabola always cuts the water-line at a short distance from the rabbets, this distance being rather greater forward than abaft.</p><p>Several American ships of war have been submitted to this method of investigation, which was found to answer very well with their bodies. Indeed there can be no great deviation, as the parabola varies according to its exponent and parameter ; if the ship is full, a large exponent adapts it to that shape ; and if the ship is lean, a small one. lf the body has a long straight of breadth, and sharpens quickly at the extremities, by deducting a part in midships from the comparison, the system may still be applied ; or if, as is the case generally with English merchant-ships, there is a very great draught of water in proportion to the breadth, by deducting a part from the water-line downwards, this method may be applied to the remainder.</p><p>From this reasoning, it appears that ships may be constructed to coincide exactly with the parabolic line, without deviating from the forms which experience has proved to be the most conducive to giving ships good qualities. Chapman stated that this would most probably be superior to the old system, and the result has confirmed his statement; for ships of the line, frigates, and merchant-men have been constructed after it, all of which have been very fine vessels.</p><p>From the manner in which the curve of sections is formed, it follows that its area multiplied by the breadth is equal to the displacement, and that the centre of gravity of the area is in the same transverse section as the centre of gravity of the body ; but the area of this curve, supposing it to be a parabola of a certain power, is a known part of the rectangle formed by the greatest ordinate and the abscissa ; hence, by making the areas of the sections decrease in the ratio of the abscissas in the parabola, we obtain certain equations between the quantities. To find these equations, suppose the parabolic line, now also representing the line of sections, to be ACB (fig. 22), cutting the water-</p></body></text></TEI>
