                <p><label>SAN JUAN (or Haro) ISLANDS</label>, an archipelago (San Juan, Orcas,
                    Shaw, Lopez, Blakely, Cypress, &amp;amp;c.) lying between Vancouver Island and
                    the mainland of North America. These islands were for many years the subject of
                    dispute between the British and the United States governments, and were finally
                    assigned to the latter country by the arbitration of the emperor of Germany (on
                    the 21st of October 1872). Geographically the cluster certainly belongs to the
                    mainland, from which it is separated by Rosario Strait, generally much under 50
                    fathoms in depth, while Haro Strait, separating it from Vancouver Island, has
                    depths ranging from 100 to 190 fathoms. In 1873 the islands, formerly considered
                    part of Whatcom county, Washington, were made the separate county of San Juan.
                    Of the total area of 200 sq. m., about 60 are in San Juan, 60 in Orcas and 30 in
                    Lopez.</p>
