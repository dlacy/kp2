<p><span class="font1">Orders of the Commission became effective within such time, not less than thirty days, as the Commission should prescribe, and&nbsp;penalties began to take effect from the date fixed by the Commission, unless the carrier secured an injunction from the Court&nbsp;suspending the order. Such injunction might not issue except&nbsp;after hearing, of which five days’ notice must be given. Decisions&nbsp;of the Commission were not reviewable by the Court unless the&nbsp;Commission had exceeded its authority, or had issued an uncon-stitutional order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A new and important act was signed by the President on the 18th of June 1910. It created a Commerce Court (composed of five judges nominated by the president of the&nbsp;United States from the Federal circuit judges), transferred to&nbsp;it jurisdiction in cases instituted to enforce or set aside orders&nbsp;of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, and made the United&nbsp;States instead of the Commission a party in all such actions.&nbsp;The law forbids a railway or any other common carrier to&nbsp;charge more for a short haul than for a long haul over the&nbsp;same line, unless, in special cases, it is authorized to do so by&nbsp;the Commission. It forbids a railway which has reduced its&nbsp;rates while in competition with a water route to raise them&nbsp;again when the competition has ceased, unless the Commission&nbsp;permits it to do so because of other changed conditions. It&nbsp;extends the initiative of the Commission from the investigation&nbsp;of complaints to the investigation of rates on its own motion;&nbsp;authorizes it to suspend rates in advance of their going into&nbsp;effect, pending an investigation which may be continued for ten&nbsp;months, and to establish through routes; and provides for a&nbsp;special commission, appointed by the President, to investigate&nbsp;questions pertaining to the issuance of railway securities.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Accident Statistics</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Statistics of railway accidents may be divided into three classes: casualties (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1">) to passengers, (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1">) to servants or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">employés&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and (r) to other persons; and again into (1) train accidents,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;accidents to persons doing work on or about trains and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">other accidents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Such statistics are studied mainly with the object of learning the lessons which they may afford as to preventive measures&nbsp;for the future; and from this point of view the most important&nbsp;element is the single item of passengers killed in train accidents&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> 1). The number injured is, indeed, a fact of interest, no less&nbsp;than the number killed, but comparisons under this head are&nbsp;unsatisfactory because it is impracticable or unprofitable to&nbsp;go into sufficient detail to determine the relative seriousness&nbsp;of the injuries. The statistics of the killed usually afford all&nbsp;necessary stimulus to improvement. Accidents to passengers&nbsp;other than those caused by collisions or derailments of trains&nbsp;are very largely due to causes which it is fair to class either&nbsp;as unavoidable or as due mainly to the fault or carelessness of&nbsp;the victim himself. That this is so is indicated by the fact&nbsp;that, although the railways—always made to suffer severely&nbsp;in pecuniary damages for injuries for which their officers or&nbsp;servants are held responsible by the courts—have for years&nbsp;taken almost every conceivable precaution, the number of&nbsp;accidents, in proportion to the number of persons travelling,&nbsp;diminishes but slowly—so slowly that, in view of the variety&nbsp;of conditions to be considered, it would hardly be safe to conclude that the diminution is due to any definite improvement&nbsp;in the safeguards provided. Collisions, on the other hand, are&nbsp;preventable, and derailments nearly so, and the records of&nbsp;deaths and injuries in this class in successive years are therefore&nbsp;justly taken as an index to the efficiency with which the railways&nbsp;are managed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The number of servants killed in train accidents is the next in importance. The safety of passengers is, indeed, the first&nbsp;care of the railway manager; but the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">employés,</span><span class="font1"> exposed to&nbsp;many risks from which the passengers are protected, must be&nbsp;looked after. On the British railways the men who run the&nbsp;trains are safeguarded very efficiently, and the collisions and&nbsp;derailments which are serious enough to do injury to the trainmen or the enginemen are really rare. The roadway, tracks&nbsp;and rolling stock are so well maintained that those causes which&nbsp;lead to the worst derailments have been eliminated almost&nbsp;completely, and the record of serious collisions has been reduced&nbsp;nearly to zero by the universal use of the block system and by&nbsp;systematic precautions at junctions. In America the record&nbsp;is far less satisfactory. The best railways of the United States&nbsp;and Canada have, indeed, been greatly improved, and their&nbsp;main lines approach the high standards of safety which prevail&nbsp;in Great Britain, both as regards maintenance and care of&nbsp;roadway and vehicles (as a preventive of derailments) and the&nbsp;use of the block system (as a preventive of collisions); but&nbsp;when the inquirer looks at America as a whole—the total&nbsp;length of lines in the United States being over 230,000 m.,&nbsp;ten times the total of the United Kingdom—he is considering&nbsp;a figure which includes an enormous mileage of railway lying&nbsp;in thinly settled regions where the high standards of safety&nbsp;maintained on the best railways have scarcely been thought&nbsp;of. The duty of a railway with deficient plant or facilities&nbsp;would seem to be to make up for their absence by moderating&nbsp;the speeds of its trains, but public sentiment in America appears&nbsp;so far to have' approved, at least tacitly, the combination of&nbsp;imperfect railways and high speeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Apart from collisions and derailments, a large proportion of all accidents is found to be due primarily to want of care on&nbsp;the part of the victims. Accidents to workmen in marshalling,&nbsp;shunting, distributing and running trains, engines and cars,&nbsp;may be taken as the most important class, after train accidents,&nbsp;because this work is necessary and important and yet involves&nbsp;considerable hazard. On British railways the duty of the&nbsp;companies to provide all practicable safeguards and to educate&nbsp;and caution the servants may be said to have been faithfully&nbsp;performed, and the accident totals must be taken as being&nbsp;somewhat near the “ irreducible minimum’’ —unless some of&nbsp;the infirmities of the human mind can be cured. In America&nbsp;the number of men killed and injured in handling freight trains&nbsp;has been very large. In the year ending June 30, 1909, exclusive&nbsp;of casualties due to collisions, derailments and other accidents&nbsp;to trains, the number killed was 811 and of injured 28,156&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Accident Bulletin,</span><span class="font1"> No. 32, p. 14). The number killed (811)&nbsp;is equal to about three in every thousand trainmen employed.&nbsp;From this and all other causes, the number of trainmen killed&nbsp;in the year ending June 30, 1909, was about 8 in 1000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The use of automatic couplers for freight cars throughout the United States, introduced in 1893-1900, greatly reduced the&nbsp;number of deaths and injuries in coupling, and the use of air&nbsp;brakes on freight cars, now universal, has reduced the risk to&nbsp;the men by making it less necessary for them to ride on the&nbsp;roofs of high box-cars, while at the same time it has made it&nbsp;possible to run long trains with fewer men; but except in&nbsp;these two features the freight service in America continues to&nbsp;be a dangerous occupation. The high and heavy cars, the&nbsp;high speeds, the severe weather in the northern states in winter,&nbsp;the fluctuating nature of the business, resulting often in the&nbsp;employment of poorly qualified men and in other irregularities,&nbsp;are among the causes of this state of things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Being struck or run over by a train while standing or walking on the track is the largest single cause of “ railway accidents. ”&nbsp;Workmen are killed and injured in this way, both while on&nbsp;duty and when going to and from their work; passengers, with&nbsp;or without right, go in front of trains at stations and at highway&nbsp;crossings at grade level; and trespassers are killed and injured&nbsp;in large numbers on railways everywhere, at and near stations,&nbsp;at crossings, and out on the open road, where they have no&nbsp;shadow of right. Of trespassers the number killed per mile of</span></p>
