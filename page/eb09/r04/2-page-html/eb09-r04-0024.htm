            <p><span class="font2">shown that no redistribution is made without urgent necessity.
                    Thus, to quote but one instance, in 4442 village communities of&nbsp;Moscow, the
                    average number of redistributions has been 2.1 in&nbsp;twenty years (1858-78),
                    and in more than two-thirds of these&nbsp;communities the redistribution took
                    place only once. On the&nbsp;other hand, a regular rotation of all households
                    over all lots, in&nbsp;order to equalize the remaining minor inequalities, is
                    very often&nbsp;practised in the black-earth region, where no manure is
                    needed.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Besides the arable mark, there is usually a </span><span
                    class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vygon</span><span class="font2"> (or “
                    common ”) for grazing, to which all householders send their cattle,
                    whatever&nbsp;the number they possess. The meadows are either divided on
                    the&nbsp;above principles, or mowed in common, and the hay
                    divided&nbsp;according to the number of lots. The forests, when consisting
                    of&nbsp;small wood in sufficient quantity, are laid under no regulations
                    ;&nbsp;when this is scarce, every trunk is counted, and valued according&nbsp;to
                    its age, number of branches, &amp;c., and the whole is divided according to the
                    number of lots.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">The houses and the orchards behind them belong also, in
                    principle, to the community ; but no peredyel is made, except after a fire or
                    when the necessity arises of building the houses at greater&nbsp;distances
                    apart. The orchards usually remain for years in the&nbsp;same hands, with but
                    slow equalizations of the lots in width.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">All decisions in the village community are given by the mir, that
                    is, by the general assembly of all householders,—women being&nbsp;admitted on an
                    equal footing with men, when widows, or when their&nbsp;male guardians are
                    absent. For the decisions unanimity is necessary ; and, though in some difficult
                    cases of a general peredyel the&nbsp;discussions may last for two or three days,
                    no decision is reached&nbsp;until the minority has declared its agreement with
                    the majority.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Each commune elects an elder </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-style:italic;">(starosta)</span><span class="font2"> ; he is the

                    to&nbsp;make him a functionary have failed.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Opinion as to the advantages and disadvantages of the village
                    community being much divided in Russia, it has been within the&nbsp;last twenty
                    years the subject of extensive inquiry, both private&nbsp;and official, and of
                    an ever-growing literature and polemic. The&nbsp;supporters of the mir are found
                    chiefly among those who have made&nbsp;more or less extensive inquiries into its
                    actual organization and consequences, while their opponents draw their arguments
                    principally&nbsp;from theoretical considerations of political economy. The
                    main&nbsp;reproach that it checks individual development and is a source
                    of&nbsp;immobility has been shaken of late by a better knowledge of
                    the&nbsp;institution, which has brought to light its remarkable plasticity
                    and&nbsp;power of adaptation to new circumstances. The free settlers
                    in&nbsp;Siberia have voluntarily introduced the same organization. In
                    north&nbsp;and north-east Russia, where arable land is scattered in small
                    patches&nbsp;among forests, communities of several villages, or “ volost ”
                    communities, have arisen ; and in the “ voisko ” of the Ural Cossacks
                    we&nbsp;find community of the whole territory as regards both land and fisheries
                    and work in common. Nay, the German colonists of southern&nbsp;Russia, who set
                    out with the principle of personal property, have subsequently introduced that
                    of the village community, adapted to their&nbsp;special needs (Clauss). In some
                    localities, where there was no great&nbsp;scarcity of land and the authorities
                    did not interfere, joint cultivation of a common area for filling the
                    storehouses has recently been&nbsp;developed (in Penza 974 communes have
                    introduced this system and&nbsp;cultivate an aggregate of 26,910 acres). The
                    renting of land in&nbsp;common, or even purchase of land by wealthy communes,
                    has become&nbsp;quite usual, as also the purchase in common of agricultural
                    implements.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Since the emancipation of the serfs, however, the mir has been
                    undergoing profound modifications. The differences of wealth&nbsp;which ensued,
                    —the impoverishment of the mass, the rapid increase&nbsp;of the rural
                    proletariat, and the enrichment of a few “kulaks”&nbsp;and “miroyedes” (“
                    mir-eaters ”),—are certainly operating unfavourably for the mir. The miroyedes
                    steadily strive to break up&nbsp;the organization of the commune as an obstacle
                    to the extension&nbsp;of their power over the moderately well-to-do peasants ;
                    while the&nbsp;proletariat cares little about the mir. Fears on the one side
                    and&nbsp;hopes on the other have been thus entertained as to the
                    likelihood&nbsp;of the mir resisting these disintegrating influences, favoured,
                    moreover, by those landowners and manufacturers who foresee in the&nbsp;creation
                    of a rural proletariat the certainty of cheap labour. But&nbsp;the village
                    community does not appear as yet to have lost the power&nbsp;of adaptation which
                    it has exhibited throughout its history. If,&nbsp;indeed, the impoverishment of
                    the peasants continues to go on, and&nbsp;legislation also interferes with the
                    mir, it must of course disappear, but not without a corresponding disturbance in
                    Russian life.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">The co-operative spirit of the Great Russians shows itself
                    further</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font2">iu another sphere in the </span><span class="font2"
                    style="font-style:italic;">artels,</span><span class="font2"> which have also
                    been a prominent feature of Russian life since the dawn of history. The artel
                    very&nbsp;much resembles the co-operative society of western Europe, with
                    this&nbsp;difference that it makes its appearance without any impulse
                    from&nbsp;theory, simply as a natural form of popular life. When
                    workmen&nbsp;from any province come, for instance, to St Petersburg to
                    engage&nbsp;in the textile industries, or to work as carpenters, masons,
                    &amp;c.,&nbsp;they immediately unite in groups of from ten to fifty
                    persons,&nbsp;settle in a house together, keep a common table, and pay each
                    his&nbsp;part of the expense to the elected elder of the artel. All Russia
                    is&nbsp;covered with such artels,—in the cities, in the forests, on the
                    banks&nbsp;of rivers, on journeys, and even in the prisons.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">The industrial artel is almost as frequent as the preceding, in
                    all those trades which admit of it A social history of the most fundamental
                    state of Russian society would be a history of their hunting,&nbsp;fishing,
                    shipping, trading, building, exploring artels. Artels of one&nbsp;or two hundred
                    carpenters, bricklayers, &amp;c., are common wherever&nbsp;new buildings have to
                    be erected, or railways or bridges made ; the&nbsp;contractors always prefer to
                    deal with an artel, rather than with&nbsp;separate workmen. The same principles
                    are often put into practice&nbsp;in the domestic trades. It is needless to add
                    that the wages divided&nbsp;by the artels are higher than those earned by
                    isolated workmen.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font2">Finally, a great pumber of artels on the stock exchange, in the
                    seaports, in the great cities (commissionaires), during the great&nbsp;fairs,
                    and on railways have grown up of late, and have acquired&nbsp;the confidence of
                    tradespeople to such an extent that considerable&nbsp;sums of money and
                    complicated banking operations are frequently&nbsp;handed over to an artelshik
                    (member of an artel) without any&nbsp;receipt, his number or his name being
                    accepted as sufficient&nbsp;guarantee. These artels are recruited only on
                    personal acquaintance with the candidates for membership, and security
                    reaching&nbsp;£80 to £100 is exacted in the exchange artels. These last have
                    a&nbsp;tendency to become mere joint-stock companies employing
                    salaried&nbsp;servants. Co-operative societies have lately been organized
                    by&nbsp;several zemstvos. They have achieved good results, but do
                    not&nbsp;exhibit, on the whole, the same unity of organization as those
                    which&nbsp;have arisen in a natural way among peasants and artisans.

                    Only in a few parts of Moscow, Vladimir, and Nijni has it been abandoned for

                    18,808,000.&nbsp;Those of 1884 (a very good year) reached an average of 18
                    per&nbsp;cent higher, except oats. The crops are, however, very
                    unequally&nbsp;distributed. In an average year there are 8 governments
                    which&nbsp;are some 6,930,000 quarters short of their requirements, 35
                    which&nbsp;have an excess of 33,770,000 quarters, and 17 which have
                    neither&nbsp;excess nor deficiency. The export of com from Russia is
                    steadily&nbsp;increasing, having risen from 6,560,000 quarters in 1856-60 to
                    an&nbsp;average of 23,700,000 quarters in 1876-83 and 26,623,700
                    quarters&nbsp;in 1884. This increase does not prove, however, an excess
                    of&nbsp;corn, for even when one-third of Russia was famine-stricken,
                    during&nbsp;the last years of scarcity, the export trade did not decline ;
                    even&nbsp;Samara exported during the last famine there, the peasants
                    being&nbsp;compelled to sell their com in autumn to pay their taxes.
