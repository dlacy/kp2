<p><span class="font0">on the Hungarian crown; hut material is lacking for a detailed description of the movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1330 the voivode John Bassaraha@@<sup>1</sup> or Bazar^tb the Great (1310-38) succeeded in inflicting a crushing defeat on his&nbsp;suzerain King Charles I. of Hungary, and for fourteen&nbsp;years Walachia enjoyed complete independence. Louis&nbsp;the Great (1342-82) succeeded for a while in restoring the Hungarian supremacy, but in 1367 the voivode</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Vlad or Vladislav inflicted another severe defeat on the Hungarians, and succeeded for a time in ousting the Magyar governor of Turnu Severin, and thus incorporating Oltland in his own&nbsp;dominions. Subsequently, in order to retain a hold on the&nbsp;loyalty of the Walachian voivode, the king of Hungary invested&nbsp;him with the title of duke of Fogaras and Omlas, Ruman districts in Transylvania.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under the voivode Mircea (1386-1418), whose prowess is still celebrated in the national folk-songs, Walachia played for a&nbsp;while a more ambitious part. This prince during the&nbsp;earlier part of his reign sought a counterpoise to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hungarian influence in close alliance with King Ladislaus V. of Poland. He added to his other titles that of “ count of Severin,&nbsp;despot of the Dobrudja, and lord of Silistria,” and both Vidin&nbsp;and Sistora appear in his possession. A Walachian contingent,&nbsp;apparently Mircea’s, aided the Servian tsar Lazar in his vain&nbsp;endeavour to resist the Turks at Kossovo (1389); later he&nbsp;allied himself with his former enemy Sigismund of Hungary&nbsp;against the Turkish sultan Bayezid I., who inflicted a&nbsp;crushing defeat on the allied armies at Nikopolis in 1396.&nbsp;Bayezid subsequently invaded and laid waste a large part of&nbsp;Walachia, but the voivode succeeded in inflicting considerable&nbsp;loss on the retiring Turks, and the capture of Bayezid by Timur&nbsp;in 1402 gave the country a reprieve. In the internecine struggle&nbsp;that followed amongst the sons of Bayezid, Mircea espoused the&nbsp;cause of Musa; but, though he thus obtained for a while considerable influence in the Turkish councils, this policy eventually&nbsp;drew on him the vengeance of the sultan Mahomet I., who&nbsp;succeeded in reducing him to a tributary position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the succeeding period the Walachian princes appear .alternately as the allies of Hungary or the creatures of the&nbsp;Turk. In the later battle of Kossovo of 1448, between&nbsp;the Hungarians, led by Hunyadi Janos and the sultan&nbsp;Murad II., the Walachian contingent treacherously&nbsp;surrendered to the Turks; but this did not hinder the&nbsp;victorious sultan from massacring the prisoners and&nbsp;adding to the tribute a yearly contribution of 3000 javelins and&nbsp;4000 shields. In 1453 Constantinople fell; in 1454 Hunyadi&nbsp;died; and a year later the sultan invaded Walachia to set up&nbsp;Vlad IV. (1455-62), the son of a former voivode. The father of&nbsp;this Vlad had himself been notorious for his ferocity, but his&nbsp;son, during his Turkish sojourn, had improved on his father’s&nbsp;example. He was known in Walachia as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dr acid,</span><span class="font0"> or the Devil,&nbsp;and has left a name in history as Vlad the Impaler. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">stories of his ferocious savagery exceed belief. He is said to have feasted amongst his impaled victims. When the sultan&nbsp;Mahomet, infuriated at the impalement of his envoy, the pasha&nbsp;of Vid in, who had been charged with Vlad’s deposition, invaded&nbsp;Walachia in person with an immense host, he is said to have&nbsp;found at one spot a forest of pales on which were the bodies&nbsp;of men, women and children. The voivode Radu (1462-75)&nbsp;was substituted for this monster by Turkish influence, and constrained to pay a tribute of 12,000 ducats; but Vlad returned&nbsp;to the throne in 1476-77.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The shifting policy of the Walachian princes at this time is well described in a letter of the Hungarian king Matthias&nbsp;Corvinus (1458-90) to Casimir of Poland. “The voivodes,”&nbsp;he writes, “ of Walachia and Moldavia fawn alternately upon&nbsp;the Turks, the Tatars, the Poles and the Hungarians, that among&nbsp;so many masters their perfidy may remain unpunished.” The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>A. Sturdza gives] a genealogical table, showing that Radu belonged to.the great native dynasty of Bassarab </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> or Bassaraba,&nbsp;which continued, though not in unbroken succession, to rule in&nbsp;Walachia until 1658, and in Moldavia until 1669.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">prevalent laxity of marriage, the frequency of divorce, and the fact that illegitimate children could succeed as well as those&nbsp;born in lawful wedlock, by multiplying the candidates for the&nbsp;voivodeship and preventing any regular system of succession,&nbsp;contributed much to the internal confusion of the country.&nbsp;The elections, though often controlled by the Turkish Divan,&nbsp;were still constitutionally in the hands of the boiars, who were&nbsp;split up into various factions, each with its own pretender to the&nbsp;throne. The princes followed one another in rapid succession,&nbsp;and usually met with violent ends. A large part of the population led a pastoral life, and at the time of Verantius’s visit to&nbsp;Walachia in the early part of the 16th century, the towns and&nbsp;villages were built of wood and wattle and daub. Tirgovishtea&nbsp;alone, at this time the capital of the country, was a considerable&nbsp;town, with two stone castles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A temporary improvement took place under Neagoe Bassaraba (1512-21). Neagoe was a great builder of monasteries; he&nbsp;founded the cathedrals of Curtea de Argesh </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.}</span><span class="font0"> and Tirgovishtea, and adorned Mount Athos with his pious works. He transferred the direct allegiance of the Walachian Church from the&nbsp;patriarchate of Ochrida in Macedonia to that of Constantinople.&nbsp;On his death, however, the brief period of comparative prosperity&nbsp;which his architectural works attest was tragically interrupted,&nbsp;and it seemed for a time that Walachia was doomed to&nbsp;sink into a Turkish pashalic. The Turkish commander,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mahmud Bey, became treacherously possessed of Nea-goe’s young son and successor, and, sending him a prisoner to Stambul, proceeded to nominate Turkish governors in the towns&nbsp;and villages of Walachia. The Walachians resisted desperately,&nbsp;elected Radu, a kinsman of Neagoe, voivode, and succeeded with&nbsp;Hungarian help in defeating Mahmud Bey at Grumatz in 1522.&nbsp;The conflict was prolonged with varying fortunes until in 1524&nbsp;the dogged opposition of the Walachians triumphed in the&nbsp;sultan’s recognition of Radu.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the battle of Mohacs in 1526 decided the long preponderance of Turkish control. The unfortunate province served as a transit route for Turkish expeditions against Hungary and&nbsp;Transylvania, and was exhausted by continual requisitions.&nbsp;Turkish settlers were gradually making good their footing on&nbsp;Walachian soil, and mosques were rising in the towns and villages.&nbsp;The voivode Alexander, who succeeded in 1591, and like his&nbsp;predecessors had bought his post of the Divan, carried the oppression still further by introducing a janissary guard and farming&nbsp;out his possessions to his Turkish supporters. Meanwhile the&nbsp;Turkish governors on the Bulgarian bank never ceased to&nbsp;ravage the country, and again it seemed as if Walachia must&nbsp;share the fate of the Balkan States and succumb to the direct&nbsp;government of the Ottoman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the depth of the national distress the choice of the people fell on Michael, the son of Petrushko, ban of Craiova, the&nbsp;first dignitary of the realm, who had fled to Transylvania to&nbsp;escape Alexander’s machinations. Supported at Constantinople&nbsp;by two influential personages, Sigismund Bathory, prince of&nbsp;Transylvania (1581-98 and 1601-2), and the English ambassador,&nbsp;Edward Barton, and aided by a loan of 200,000 florins, Michael&nbsp;succeeded in procuring from the Divan the deposition of his&nbsp;enemy and his own nomination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genius of Michael “the Brave” (1593-1601) secured Walachia for a time a place in universal history. The moment&nbsp;for action was favourable. The emperor Rudolph II. had&nbsp;gained some successes over the Turks, and Sigismund&nbsp;B&amp;thory had been driven by Turkish extortions to throw&nbsp;off the allegiance to the sultan. But the first obstacle to be dealt&nbsp;with was the presence of the enemy within the walls. By previous&nbsp;concert with the Moldavian voivode Aaron, on the 13th of&nbsp;November 1594, the Turkish guards and settlers in the two principalities were massacred at a given signal. Michael followed up&nbsp;these “ Walachian Vespers ” by an actual invasion of Turkish&nbsp;territory, and, aided by Sigismund Bathory, succeeded in carrying&nbsp;by assault Rustchuk, Silistria and other places on the right bank&nbsp;of the lower Danube. A simultaneous invasion of Walachia&nbsp;by a large Turkish and Tatar host was successfully defeated;</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
