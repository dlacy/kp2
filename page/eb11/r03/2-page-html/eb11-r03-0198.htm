<p><span class="font2">style in which the artist recounts the Dacian campaigns of Trajan as a creation of the Roman genius. We shall see that&nbsp;the term is not altogether a happy one; but there is good&nbsp;reason (as will be shown below) for the belief that the designer&nbsp;of the column, however profoundly influenced in his selection&nbsp;of motives and in his composition of individual scenes by&nbsp;Greek tradition, nevertheless worked out his main principles&nbsp;for himself. The realism of the Roman is shown in the minute&nbsp;rendering of details, which makes the reliefs a priceless source&nbsp;of information as to military antiquities. Historical art&nbsp;achieved no less a triumph in the great frieze from Trajan’s&nbsp;Forum (Plate II. fig. 16), and in the panels of the arch at&nbsp;Benevento. Imposing as these works are, they suffer from&nbsp;the defects incidental to an art which endeavours to express&nbsp;too much. Overcharged with detail, and packed with meanings&nbsp;which reveal themselves only to patient study, they lack the&nbsp;spacious and reposeful character of Greek art; while, if we&nbsp;regard only their decorative function, we must admit that the&nbsp;excess of ornamental surface mars the effect of the buildings&nbsp;which they adorn. Along the path thus marked out, Roman&nbsp;art continued to progress; it is true that under the influence&nbsp;of Hadrian there was a brief renaissance of classicism which&nbsp;gave birth to the idealized type of Antinous, and to certain&nbsp;eclectic works which belong to Greek rather than to Roman&nbsp;art; but the historical reliefs which survive from the Antonine&nbsp;period, and more especially the sarcophagi, which reproduce&nbsp;scenes of Greek mythology with a close adherence to the letter&nbsp;but a fresh artistic spirit, show that the new leaven was at work.&nbsp;The main fact underlying the changes of the time was the loss&nbsp;of the true principles of plastic art, which even in Hellenistic&nbsp;times had become obscured by the introduction of pictorial&nbsp;methods into relief-sculpture. Colour, rather than form, now&nbsp;took the highest place in the gamut of artistic values. Painting,&nbsp;indeed, so far as our scanty knowledge goes, was not practised&nbsp;with conspicuous success; but the art of mosaic was carried&nbsp;to an extraordinary degree of technical perfection; and in&nbsp;strictly plastic art the choice of material was often determined&nbsp;by qualities of colour and transparency. For example, porphyry, basalt and alabaster of various hues were used by the&nbsp;sculptor in preference to white marble; and new conventions,&nbsp;such as the plastic rendering of the iris and pupil of the eye,&nbsp;were dictated by the ever-growing need for contrasts of light&nbsp;and shadow. This great revolution in taste has been traced,&nbsp;and doubtless with justice, to the permeation of the Graeco-Roman world of the 2nd century by oriental ideas. The East&nbsp;has always preferred colour to form, and richness of ornament&nbsp;to significance of subject; and in art, as in religion, the West&nbsp;was now content to borrow. Roman official art, however,&nbsp;continued to produce the historical monuments which the&nbsp;achievements of the time demanded; but the principles of&nbsp;figure-composition were less fully grasped. The reliefs of the&nbsp;Aurelian Column form a less intelligible series than those of the&nbsp;Column of Trajan; and the panels of the Arch of Septimius&nbsp;Severus, with their bird’s-eye perspective, have not inaptly&nbsp;been compared to Flemish tapestries. The extravagance and&nbsp;pomp of the dynasty founded by Septimius Severus filled Rome&nbsp;with such works as the art of the time could produce; and&nbsp;the busts of Caracalla show that in portraiture Roman craftsmen retained their cunning. Even during the anarchy which&nbsp;followed masterpieces such as the portrait of Philip the Arabian&nbsp;were produced; and during the reign of Gallienus </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a d.</span><span class="font2"> 253-268),&nbsp;which saw the dismemberment of the Empire, there was a noteworthy outburst of artistic activity, whose products are seen&nbsp;in the naturalistic portraits of the emperor and the court.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>But by the close of the 3rd century a further transformation&nbsp;had taken place, which coincided with the political revolution&nbsp;by which the absolute monarchy of Diocletian succeeded to&nbsp;the principate of Augustus. The portraits of Constantine&nbsp;and his house can no longer be termed naturalistic: they are</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">monumental, both in scale and in conception, and, above all, their rigid “ frontality ” carries us back at a bound to the&nbsp;primitive art of the East. The classical standard set by the&nbsp;Greek genius had ceased to govern art, although the fund of&nbsp;types which Hellenism had created still furnished subjects to&nbsp;the artist, or was made the vehicle by which the new ideas&nbsp;derived from Christianity were expressed. The Roman spirit&nbsp;was still strong enough to maintain that interest in the human&nbsp;form and the representation of dramatic events which was&nbsp;lacking in the Oriental; but in the monuments of the Constan-tinian period, such as the narrow friezes of the Arch of Constantine, we can see nothing but the work of artists who had&nbsp;lost touch with true plastic principles, in spite of the ingenious&nbsp;arguments adduced </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font2">Riegl. If we are to seek for signs of&nbsp;progress, it must be rather in the domain of architecture, which&nbsp;had never ceased to make advances in dealing with the spatial&nbsp;and constructive problems presented by the great building&nbsp;works of the Empire; it was now called upon to face a fresh&nbsp;task in providing Christians with a fit place for public worship.&nbsp;In the solution of this problem the architects of the 4th century&nbsp;showed a wonderful fertility of resource; but to describe their&nbsp;achievements would be to pass the confines of Roman art in the&nbsp;proper sense of the word.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(3) </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Individual Arts, (a) Architecture.</span><span class="font2">—This branch of the subject may be studied in the article </span><span class="font0">ARCinTECTURE, </span><span class="font2">and illustrations will be found in other articles </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Capital; Column;&nbsp;Order; Triumphal Arch; &amp;c.).</span><span class="font2"> Architecture, regarded&nbsp;as a fine art, had been brought by the Greeks to the highest&nbsp;perfection of which it was capable under the limitations which&nbsp;they imposed upon themselves. The Greek temple appeals&nbsp;to the aesthetic sense by the simplicity and harmony of its&nbsp;proportions as well as by the rational correspondence between&nbsp;function and decoration in its several members. On these fines&nbsp;there was no room for progress. It is true that the Etruscans&nbsp;modified the type of the Greek temple and profoundly influenced&nbsp;Roman construction in this respect. The Etruscan temple&nbsp;was not approached on all sides by a low flight of steps, but&nbsp;raised on a high platform </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(podium)</span><span class="font2"> with a staircase in the front;&nbsp;it was broad in proportion to its depth, indeed, in many cases,&nbsp;square; and the temple itself </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(cella)</span><span class="font2"> was faced by a deep portico,&nbsp;which often occupied half the platform. Moreover, as the use&nbsp;of marble for building was unknown in early Italy, wood was&nbsp;employed in construction and terra-cotta in decoration, and&nbsp;this change of material led to a wider spacing of the columns&nbsp;than was possible in Greece. But these alterations in the&nbsp;system of proportions were disadvantageous to aesthetic effect;&nbsp;and the Romans—though they soon ceased (under the influence&nbsp;of the western Greeks) to build temples of purely “ Tuscan ”&nbsp;type—preserved certain of their features, such as the high&nbsp;platform and deep portico (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Architecture,</span><span class="font2"> fig. 26). Nor&nbsp;can we regard as felicitous the design of certain Roman temples,&nbsp;such as that of Concord overlooking the Forum, and the supposed temple of Augustus (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rome),</span><span class="font2"> which have a broad front&nbsp;(approached in the temple of Concord by a central portico)&nbsp;and narrow sides. The great temples of the Empire were (in&nbsp;general) inspired by Greek models, and need not therefore&nbsp;concern us; but we may notice Hadrian’s peculiar design for&nbsp;the double temple of Venus and Rome, with twin </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cellae</span><span class="font2"> placed&nbsp;back to back. To the orders (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order)</span><span class="font2"> of Greek architecture&nbsp;the Etruscans added the “ Tuscan,” a simplified Doric, of which&nbsp;an early example has been found at Pompeii, enclosed within&nbsp;the wall of the Casa del Fauno.@@<sup>2</sup> This column, which can&nbsp;scarcely be later than the 6th century </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> has a smooth shaft&nbsp;with pronounced entasis, a heavy capital with a scotia between&nbsp;abacus and echinus, and a plain circular base. To the Romans&nbsp;we owe the “ Composite ” order, so called because it contains&nbsp;features distinctive of the Corinthian and Ionic orders (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Order,</span><span class="font2"> fig. 14). It is really a variety of the Corinthian, with&nbsp;Ionic volutes inserted in the capital; the earliest known&nbsp;example of its use is seen in the Arch of Titus. The Romans,&nbsp;moreover, made frequent use of the figured capital, which, as</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
