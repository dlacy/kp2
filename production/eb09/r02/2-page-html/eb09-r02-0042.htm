<p><span class="font0">ing questions arise as to the exact mode of action of the respiratory centre. Is there an expiratory centre apart from the inspiratory ?&nbsp;In ordinary quiet breathing expiration is not a muscular act in the&nbsp;sense that inspiration is ; but in laboured breathing many muscles&nbsp;are coordinated to help in the act ; we may therefore assume that&nbsp;there is an expiratory coordinating mechanism as well as an inspiratory. Another inquiry touches the question of the stimulation of&nbsp;the respiratory centre. We have arrived at the conclusion that a&nbsp;certain impoverished or impure state of the blood is the cause of&nbsp;the activity of the respiratory centres. Is it by a direct action of&nbsp;the blood on the nerve centre, or is it by an action of the blood&nbsp;upon the end-organs of nerves in the peripheral parts of the body&nbsp;which indirectly induce the respkatory centre to act ? In other&nbsp;words, λvould the respiratory centre act under the stimulus of a&nbsp;certain degree of impurity of its blood if it were cut off absolutely&nbsp;from its afferent fibres ? This is not a question which admits of an&nbsp;absolutely decisive experimental answer ; but this may be said in&nbsp;reference to it, that, if the cerebrum be extirpated, the pneumo-gastric nerves divided, and the spinal chord severed at a point&nbsp;below that from which the main respiratory efferent nerves&nbsp;emerge, notwithstanding that the respiratory centre is thus&nbsp;separated from by far the greater number of the sensory nerves&nbsp;of the body, respiration still goes on. Further, if the spinal axis is&nbsp;divided at a level immediately above that of the respiratory centre,&nbsp;respiration goes on in the lower parts of the body but ceases in&nbsp;the upper—that is, the facial movements cease ; while, if the&nbsp;division be carried through a point immediately below the level&nbsp;of the respiratory centre, although chest movement ceases and&nbsp;respiration may in strictness be said to be permanently stopped,&nbsp;yet the facial movements, which are just as essential to the&nbsp;complete idea of respiration, and which are innervated from the&nbsp;common respiratory centre, continue to be performed so long as any&nbsp;life remains in the mutilated animal. There is therefore a very&nbsp;strong presumption that the respiratory centre is automatic, that&nbsp;is, that it has within itself the spring of its own activity, and that&nbsp;the impurity of the blood which sets the respiratory mechanism&nbsp;agoing does so by acting upon the respiratory nervous centre&nbsp;directly. However started, the inspiratory stimulus is discharged&nbsp;rhythmically down the efferent respiratory nerve during healthy&nbsp;life. The rhythm is capable of wide variation, both by the&nbsp;exercise of the will and by the operation of external conditions,&nbsp;such as heat and muscular exercise of the body, which accelerate&nbsp;respiration independently of the will. The question why the discharge is rhythmical is one of the deeper problems of physiology,&nbsp;and touches the essential nature of nervous actions in general.&nbsp;It is customary in physiological treatises to illustrate it by&nbsp;supposing a mechanism which offers a resistance to the discharges&nbsp;of its own energy ; when the energy reaches a certain degree of&nbsp;tension resistance is overcome and the discharge takes place, but&nbsp;a certain time must elapse before energy can again accumulate to&nbsp;the extent of overcoming resistance. It is further supposed that&nbsp;resistance is capable of being varied by external agencies ; when&nbsp;it is increased the discharges occur at longer intervals, because&nbsp;more energy must be accumulated before resistance can be overborne, but at the same time they are more violent ; when&nbsp;resistance is diminished, the discharges are more rapid but less&nbsp;powerful, until, when resistance becomes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nil,</span><span class="font0"> the discharge is&nbsp;continuous. Such illustrations are, however, of very doubtful&nbsp;value ; they impart a sense of clearness to our views of nervous&nbsp;action by turning attention from the problem we wish elucidated&nbsp;to another and altogether different problem. There is in fact no&nbsp;probability whatever, so far as facts yet go, that nervous rhythmical action is brought about in any such way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chemistry of Respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The mechanism which has just been described has for its object an interchange of substances between the body&nbsp;and the external medium. Certain substances pass out&nbsp;of the body at the lungs, and others are taken into the&nbsp;body. The discussion of this interchange pertains to&nbsp;what is called the Chemistry of Respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comparison of Inspired and Expired Air.—</span><span class="font1">No inconsiderable knowledge of this exchange of matters may be obtained at once by a simple comparison of inspired and&nbsp;expired air. The air we breathe varies somewhat according to the various circumstances of season, time of day,&nbsp;height above sea level, prevailing wind, &amp;c.; but all&nbsp;samples of pure atmospheric air have substantially the&nbsp;following composition :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. Gases :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Oxygen...........................20<sup>,</sup>84 to 20<sup>,</sup>92 vols. p.c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nitrogen..........................79 Ό0 to 79 Ό5</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Carbon dioxide............................. 0Ό4</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. Aqueous vapour.—The absolute amount of this ingredient&nbsp;varies very much, and must be distinguished carefully from the&nbsp;relative or sensible moisture, which depends more upon the&nbsp;temperature of the air than upon the absolute'quantity of watery&nbsp;vapour it contains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Air which is expired from the lungs has approximately the following composition :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gases :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Oxygen..............<sub>.</sub>......................16‘03 vols. p.c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nitrogen............:.....................79<sup>-</sup>02 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Carbon dioxide.....................3'3 to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">5 5 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;,,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Probably there is an exceedingly small excess of nitrogen in expired air as compared with inspired air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aqueous vapour.—The absolute amount is always such as&nbsp;to saturate the air at the temperature which it has on expiration,&nbsp;i.e., 36° ∙3 C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Organic matter of uncertain composition but hurtful when&nbsp;reinhaled.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On an average (subject, however, to considerable variations) it appears that the body takes up in respiration oxygen gas to the amount of 4<sup>-</sup>78 vols, per cent, of the&nbsp;air inhaled, and it gives off carbon dioxide to the average&nbsp;amount of 4<sup>,</sup>38 vols, per cent., besides traces of nitrogen,&nbsp;ammonia, hydrogen, and light carburetted hydrogen.&nbsp;Leaving out of calculation the minute traces of the latter&nbsp;bodies, it will be observed that the volume of oxygen&nbsp;taken into the body is larger than the volume of carbon&nbsp;dioxide given off ; and, since, under like conditions of&nbsp;pressure and temperature, equal volumes of oxygen gas&nbsp;and carbon dioxide gas contain the same quantity of&nbsp;oxygen, it is clear that more oxygen enters the body at&nbsp;the lungs than escapes from it; therefore the whole of the&nbsp;oxygen taken into the body does not leave it as carbonic&nbsp;acid or expired air. The ratio of CO., expired to O&nbsp;absorbed is called the “ respiratory quotient”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">∞<sub>2</sub> = i^<sub>0</sub>∙9<sub>16 </sub>O 4782</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Composition of Air in the Air Cells.—</span><span class="font1">The whole of the air of the lungs is not expelled at each breath, some remaining in the depths as residual air lodged in the alveoli or air&nbsp;cells. Hence we cannot assume, from an examination of&nbsp;expired air, that we know the constitution of the air in the&nbsp;recesses of the lungs where it comes most intimately into&nbsp;contact with the blood. To attain such knowledge it is&nbsp;necessary to examine the deeper air directly, and the air is&nbsp;obtained for such purposes by means of a lung catheter.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1&nbsp;</sup>In this way it has been ascertained that the alveolar&nbsp;air of a dog’s lung contained about 3<sup>-</sup>8 per cent, of CO.,&nbsp;at a time when the expired air contained about 2<sup>-</sup>8 per&nbsp;cent. As to the amount of O we may safely assume that&nbsp;the alveolar air never in ordinary circumstances contains&nbsp;less than 10 per cent, when the expired air contains 16&nbsp;per cent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Quantity of Substances Exchanged.—</span><span class="font1">During 24 hours an average person would take in about 10,000&nbsp;grains of oxygen in respiration, and give out about 12,000&nbsp;grains of carbon dioxide, corresponding to 3300 grains&nbsp;of carbon ; at the same time about 9 oz. of water would&nbsp;be exhaled. These quantities vary, however, within wide&nbsp;limits according to the conditions of age, sex, atmospheric&nbsp;pressure, and the like. Thus, for example, in young persons the O absorbed is relatively greater than the CO.<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>given off, and a child gives off twice as much CO<sub>2</sub> in&nbsp;relation to its body weight as an adult. Again, males</span></p>

The apparatus is passed (with the collar collapsed) through a hole in the trachea and guided into one of the finer&nbsp;bronchial tubes ; the collar is then inflated, and serves to fix the&nbsp;catheter hermetically in the bronchial tube and to place that tube&nbsp;with its tributary tubes and alveoli in direct communication with the&nbsp;outer air through the fine catheter. Breathing is unimpeded ; and&nbsp;air may be collected from the recesses of the lung for analysis.</span></p>
