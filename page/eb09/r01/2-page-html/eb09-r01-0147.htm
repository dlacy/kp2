<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">from that professed by a neighbouring potentate, the carrying out of such a law could scarcely fail to generate&nbsp;or intensify feelings of aversion and enmity between their&nbsp;respective subjects, while its complete failure as a means&nbsp;of bringing about unanimity is shown in the rise of those&nbsp;numerous controversies which afterwards enabled the adherents of Romanism to launch so effective a taunt against&nbsp;the principles of Protestantism. Among these controversies&nbsp;were those of the Majorists (1551-1562), whose founder,&nbsp;Georg Major of Wittenberg, maintained the doctrine of&nbsp;the necessity of good works to salvation; of the Synergists (1555-1567), who held that men could not be saved&nbsp;unless the operations of the divine grace were seconded&nbsp;by the spiritual efforts of the individual soul; of the followers of Osiander (1549-1567), who supported a modified&nbsp;theory of the doctrine of justification; of the Crypto-Calvinists (1552-1574), who, led by Peucerus, the son-in-law of Melanchthon, maintained against Flacius Illyricus&nbsp;a theory of predestination differing from the Lutheran&nbsp;doctrine. In this last instance the feelings of enmity&nbsp;engendered by the controversy rose to such a pitch that&nbsp;the elector of Saxony was induced to send the leading&nbsp;Philippists to prison, while Flacius and his party celebrated&nbsp;the victory which they held to be theirs by a solemn&nbsp;service of thanksgiving and a commemorative medal. In&nbsp;the year 1580 an endeavour was made to bring about a&nbsp;reconciliation of the various contending parties by drawing&nbsp;up the celebrated Formula of Concord, but the design was&nbsp;attended with but little success. In the midst of this&nbsp;theological ferment, however, the divines of the university&nbsp;of Helmstadt, in the earlier part of the 17th century, were&nbsp;honourably distinguished by their systematic endeavours&nbsp;to allay the strife; and the career of Georg Calixtus,&nbsp;while affording a remarkable illustration of a gloomy chapter in the history of Protestantism, may be cited as a proof&nbsp;that a faithful adherence to the principles of the Reformation was not incompatible with a regard for the right of&nbsp;private judgment and intellectual freedom,&nbsp;i- In the Scandinavian kingdoms the Reformation was&nbsp;materially assisted by political motives; the introduction&nbsp;of Lutheranism into Denmark by King Christian II. in&nbsp;1520 was to a great extent the result of his desire to&nbsp;raise the lower classes with a view to the corresponding&nbsp;depression of the nobility and the more powerful ecclesiastics of the realm. He sanctioned the marriage of the&nbsp;clergy and caused the New Testament to be translated&nbsp;into Danish. These measures, however, owing in no slight&nbsp;degree to the motives by which they were held to be&nbsp;inspired, involved him in a struggle with his subjects&nbsp;which eventually led to his deposition and to his passing&nbsp;the rest of his life in exile. But the new doctrines continued to be effectively preached by John Tausen, who&nbsp;had been among Luther’s pupils at Wittenberg; and the&nbsp;principles of the Reformation spread rapidly in Schleswig&nbsp;and Holstein. On the accession of Christian’s successor,&nbsp;Christian III. (his cousin), the movement acquired fresh&nbsp;strength. The new monarch had been a witness of Luther’s&nbsp;heroic conduct at Worms and had conceived the warmest&nbsp;admiration for the character of the great Reformer, and&nbsp;through his efforts the tenets of the Reformation were&nbsp;adopted in 1536, at a diet held at Copenhagen, as the&nbsp;religion of the state. In the following year the movement extended to Norway and shortly after that to Iceland. In Sweden the Reformation was established concurrently with the political revolution which placed Gustavus&nbsp;Vasa on the throne. It was, however, only too apparent&nbsp;that the patriot king was largely influenced by the expectation of replenishing his exhausted exchequer from the&nbsp;revenues of the church, and, as in Germany and in England, the assent of the nobility was gained by their</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">admission to a considerable share in the confiscated property. Among the powerful cities which represented the great Hanseatic confederacy, again, the acceptance of&nbsp;Lutheran doctrine turned largely on the keen commercial&nbsp;rivalry that then existed between that confederacy and&nbsp;Holland, and on the contests between the privileged and&nbsp;the unprivileged classes in the towns. In the prosecution of&nbsp;the former struggle the burghers of Lübeck appealed for&nbsp;assistance to Denmark, and, failing to gain the aid they&nbsp;sought, proceeded to organize an alliance with the object&nbsp;of restoring Christian II. to his throne; at the same time,&nbsp;with the view of outbidding their opponents in popularity,&nbsp;they unwisely proclaimed revolutionary principles scarcely&nbsp;less subversive than those of Münzer. In the civil war&nbsp;that ensued Christian III. ultimately triumphed over his&nbsp;enemies, and Wullenwever, the leader of the fanatical party,&nbsp;suffered death upon the scaffold. The Reformation was&nbsp;now firmly established, but in, conjunction with the monarchy reinforced by the power of the nobility, while the&nbsp;ecclesiastical constitution was remodelled ; and in the year&nbsp;1539, at the diet of Odense, the new faith was proclaimed&nbsp;as the religion of the land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Bohemia the Hussite movement (see Huss and] </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Hussites) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">must be held to have become almost absorbed&nbsp;in the broader current of Lutheranism, although the Calix-tines (or moderate Utraquists) and the Taborites (or extreme party) long continued to differ on questions of discipline. In the earlier part of the 17 th century, however,&nbsp;the trained activity and energy of the Jesuits led to the&nbsp;almost entire expulsion of both parties, and Protestantism&nbsp;as a professed creed nearly ceased to survive.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Poland Protestantism prevailed before the first quarter of the 16th century closed. In Dantzic, Elbing,&nbsp;and Thorn it was established by overwhelming majorities.&nbsp;By the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pax Dissidentium,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> however, with a view to averting&nbsp;contests such as those that disturbed the peace of other&nbsp;lands, the principle of universal toleration was enunciated;&nbsp;and the duke of Anjou (afterwards Henry III. of France),&nbsp;on being elected to the vacant throne of Poland in 1573,&nbsp;notwithstanding his own attachment to Catholicism, found&nbsp;himself compelled to swear that he would strictly protect&nbsp;the adherents of the opposed faith from persecution and&nbsp;aggression. But here again the influence of the Jesuits&nbsp;ultimately proved victorious. The nobles were gained over&nbsp;by their arts, and Catholicism reasserted its ascendency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Netherlands, where the free spirit of the great mercantile communities was in singular harmony with the&nbsp;movement, the progress was still more rapid. The details&nbsp;of the heroic struggle waged against Charles Y. and Philip&nbsp;II. must be regarded as belonging rather to secular than to&nbsp;theological history; but it is to be noted, alike to the honour&nbsp;of the people and of the house of Orange, that the enactment of the principle of religious toleration followed upon&nbsp;the fierce and intolerant persecution to which the country&nbsp;had so long been exposed. Although the majority of the&nbsp;inhabitants professed the tenets of Calvinism, the Arminian&nbsp;party succeeded in bringing about a union of church and&nbsp;state, which, however, left the other communions almost&nbsp;entirely unrestricted in their religious freedom. The followers of Gomarus, indeed, early in the 17th century,&nbsp;seemed at one time likely to place this freedom in danger,&nbsp;not only by their assertion of more rigid Calvinistic doctrine,&nbsp;but also by their demand that the church should be constituted independent of the state. But eventually (see&nbsp;Motley, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hist, of the United Netherlands</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, c. lii.) the party&nbsp;that favoured religious toleration triumphed; and the Dutch&nbsp;republic long continued to be an asylum for those whom&nbsp;the ascendency of the contrary principle in other lands&nbsp;drove into exile. The church organization was modelled&nbsp;on the political organization of the provinces, each province</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
