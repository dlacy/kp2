<p><span class="font0">power for thousands of floating watermills, which lie moored in the shallows. It is fed by many tributaries, which rise in the&nbsp;Carpathians as mountain torrents, growing broad and sluggish as&nbsp;they flow south-eastward through the central Rumanian plain. In&nbsp;Walachia, it is joined by the Jiu (or Schyl) opposite Rahova; by&nbsp;the Olt (ancient Aluta) at Turnu Magurele; by the united streams*&nbsp;of the Dimbovitza </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Dambovifa)</span><span class="font0"> and Argesh </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(A rge$)</span><span class="font0"> at Oltenitza;&nbsp;by the Jalomitza </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ialomtya)</span><span class="font0"> opposite Hirsova. The Olt pierces&nbsp;the Carpathians, by way of the Rothenthurm Pass, and forms the&nbsp;boundary of Little </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font0"> western) Walachia, or Oltland. The Sereth&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Siretu</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Serefa)</span><span class="font0"> flows for about 340 m. from its Transylvanian&nbsp;source through Moldavia, and meets the Danube near Galatz, after&nbsp;receiving the Moldova, Bistritza </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Bistrifa},</span><span class="font0"> Trotosh </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Troto$u),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Milcovu, Putna, R£mnicu and Buzeu on the west; and the Berlad&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Berladu)</span><span class="font0"> on the east. The Milcovu was the former boundary&nbsp;between Walachia and Moldavia. The Pruth rises on the northern&nbsp;limit of Moldavia, forms the eastern frontier for 330 m., and falls&nbsp;into the Danube 10 m. E. of Galatz. Its chief Rumanian tributaries&nbsp;are the Basheu </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ba$eu)</span><span class="font0"> and Jijia, rivers of the north. The Dobrudja&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> or Dobrogea covers about 2900 sq. m. between the Black&nbsp;Sea and the lower reaches of the Danube. Its high crystalline&nbsp;rocks, covered with sedimentary formations, descend abruptly&nbsp;towards the delta, but more gradually towards the south, where&nbsp;the Bulgarian steppes encroach upon Rumanian soil. The few&nbsp;small rivers which drain the hills generally flow seaward, but those&nbsp;of the delta and steppes belong to the Danubian system. The&nbsp;coast is a low-lying region of sandhills, meres and marshes with&nbsp;one lagoon, 42 m. long, connected by a short stream with the St&nbsp;George Mouth. Its outlet on the sea is named the Portidje Mouth&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Gura portifii)</span><span class="font0"> of the Danube. North of this, the lagoon is called&nbsp;Lake Razim; while its southern half, shut off by three long islands,&nbsp;is the Blue Lake </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Sinoe Osero,</span><span class="font0"> in Bulgarian).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Apart from the Dobrudja, the whole of Rumania is included in the northerfi basin of the lower Danube. It consists of a single&nbsp;inclined plane stretching upwards, with a north-westerly direction,&nbsp;from the left bank of the river to the summits of the Carpathians.&nbsp;It is divided into three zones—steppe, forest and alpine. The first&nbsp;begins beyond the mud-flats and reed-beds which line the water’s edge,&nbsp;and is a vast monotonous lowland, sloping so gently as to seem almost&nbsp;level. The surface is a yellow clay, with patches of brown or dark&nbsp;grey, outliers of the Russian <sup>M</sup> black earth. ” Cereals, chiefly maize,&nbsp;with green crops and fields of gourds, alternate with fallow land&nbsp;overgrown by coarse grasses, weeds and stunted shrubs. Among&nbsp;the scanty trees, willows and poplars are commonest. The second&nbsp;zone extends over the foothills and lower ridges of the Carpathians.&nbsp;This region, called by Rumans &quot; the district of vines, ” is the most&nbsp;fertile portion of the country. In it grow most fruits and flowers&nbsp;which thrive in a temperate climate. Oaks, elms, firs, ashes and&nbsp;beeches are the principal forest trees. The third zone covers the&nbsp;higher mountains on their southern and eastern sides, whose violently&nbsp;contorted strata leave many transverse valleys, though usually&nbsp;inclining laterally towards the south-east. The birch and larch&nbsp;woods of this zone give way to pine forests as the altitude increases;&nbsp;and the pines to mosses, lichens and alpine plants, just below the&nbsp;jagged iron-grey peaks, many of which attain altitudes of 6000 to&nbsp;8000 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geology.—</span><span class="font0">The axis of the Transylvanian Alps consists of sericite schists and other similar rocks; and these arc followed on the&nbsp;south by Jurassic, Cretaceous and Early Tertiary beds. The&nbsp;J urassic and Cretaceous beds are ordinary marine sediments, but&nbsp;from the Cenomanian to the Oligocene the deposits are of the&nbsp;peculiar facies known in the Alps and Carpathians as Flysch.&nbsp;Farther north, the Flysch forms practically the whole of the&nbsp;Rumanian flank of the Carpathians. Along the foot of the Carpathians lies a broad trough of Miocene salt-bearing beds, and in&nbsp;this trough the strata are sometimes horizontal and sometimes&nbsp;strongly folded. Outside the band of Miocene beds the Sarmatian,&nbsp;Pontian and Levantine series, often concealed by Quaternary&nbsp;deposits, cover the great part of the Danube plain. Even the&nbsp;Pontian beds are sometimes folded. In the Dobrudja crystalline&nbsp;rocks, presumably of ancient date, rise through the Tertiary and&nbsp;recent deposits and form the hills which lie between the Danube&nbsp;and the Black Sea.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Climate.—</span><span class="font0">The Rumanian climate alternates between extreme cold in winter, when the thermometer may fall to-20° Fahrenheit&nbsp;and extreme heat in summer, when it may rise to ioo° in the shade.&nbsp;Autumn is the mildest season; spring lasts only for a few weeks.&nbsp;Spring at Bucharest has a mean temperature of 53°; summer,</span></p>
