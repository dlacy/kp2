<p><span class="font0">RUBBLE, broken stone, of irregular size and shape. This word is closely connected in derivation with <sup>44</sup> rubbish,” which&nbsp;was formerly also applied to what we now call <sup>44</sup> rubble.” The&nbsp;earlier Middle English form was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">robeux</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">robows.</span><span class="font0"> It would&nbsp;appear that the original is an 0. Fr. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fobel, Roba</span><span class="font0"> (older form&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">robba)</span><span class="font0"> is found in Italian in the sense of refuse, trash. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Robba&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is explained by Florio as a gown, or mantle, robe, wealth, goods,&nbsp;trash. The original sense was <sup>44</sup> spoiL” Thus, <sup>44</sup> robe,” <sup>44</sup> rob,”&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> rubbish ” and <sup>44</sup> rubble ” are all cognate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Rubble-work ” is a name applied to several species of masonry (?.?.). One kind, where the stones are loosely thrown&nbsp;together in a wall between boards and grouted with mortar&nbsp;almost like concrete, is called in Italian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mwraglia di gctto</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;in French </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bocage.</span><span class="font0"> Work executed with large stones put together&nbsp;without any attempt at courses is also called rubble.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUBELLITE, a red variety of tourmaline (g.z&gt;.) used as a gem-stone. It generally occurs crystallized on the walls of&nbsp;cavities in coarse granitic rocks, where it is often associated&nbsp;with a pink lithia-mica (lepidolite). The most valued kinds are&nbsp;deep red; the colour being probably due to the presence of&nbsp;manganese. Some of the fines^ rubellite is found in Siberia,&nbsp;whence it is sometimes called siberite, or passes under the&nbsp;misleading name of “ Siberian ruby.” The mills at Ekaterinburg, where it is cut and polished, draw most of their supplies&nbsp;from the Ural Mountains—chiefly from Mursinka, Sarapulskaya&nbsp;and Shaitanka, near Ekaterinburg—but specimens are occasionally found at Nerchinsk in Transbaikalia. Burma is&nbsp;famous for rubellite, but little was known as to the conditions&nbsp;of its occurrence there until after the British annexation, when&nbsp;the old workings were visited and described by C. Barrington&nbsp;Brown and by F. Noetling. The pits which yield rubellite&nbsp;are dug in alluvial deposits in the Mong-long valley, some miles&nbsp;to the S.E. of Mogok, the centre of the ruby country. It was&nbsp;here that the Chinese obtained the rubellite so much valued in&nbsp;China for buttons of the caps of mandarins of certain rank. In&nbsp;the British Museum there is a remarkable specimen of crystallized rubellite of large size and fine form, but of poor colour, which&nbsp;was presented by the king of Ava to Colonel Michael Symes on&nbsp;the occasion of his mission in 1795. Very fine rubellite is found in&nbsp;the United States, notably at Mount Mica, near Paris, Oxford Co.,&nbsp;Maine, where the crystals are often red at one end and green at&nbsp;the other. Mount Rubellite, near Hebron, and Mount Apatite&nbsp;at Auburn, are other localities in the same state from which&nbsp;fine specimens are obtained. Chesterfield and Goshen, Mass.,&nbsp;also yield red tourmaline, frequently associated with green in&nbsp;the same crystal. Pink tourmaline also occurs, with lepidolite&nbsp;and kunzite, in San Diego Co., California. In Europe rubellite&nbsp;occurs sparingly at a few localities, as at San Piero in Elba and&nbsp;at Penig in Saxony; but the mineral is rarely if ever fit for the&nbsp;lapidary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(F.

<p><span class="font0">RUBENS, PETER PAUL (1577-1640), Flemish painter, was born at Siegen, in Westphalia, on the 29th of June 1577. His&nbsp;father, Johannes Rubens, a druggist, although of humble&nbsp;descent was a man of learning, and councillor and alderman in&nbsp;his native town (1562). A Roman Catholic by birth, he became&nbsp;a zealous upholder of the Reformation, and we find him spoken&nbsp;of as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">le plus docte Calviniste qui Just pour lors au Bas Pays.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">After the plundering of the Antwerp churches in 1566, the&nbsp;magistrates were called upon for a justification. While openly&nbsp;they declared themselves devoted sons of the church, a list&nbsp;of the followers of the Reformed creed, headed by the name of&nbsp;Anthony Van Stralen, the burgomaster, got into the hands of&nbsp;the duke of Alva. This was a sentence of death for the magistrates, and Johannes Rubens lost no time in quitting Spanish&nbsp;soil, ultimately settling at Cologne (October 1568) <sub>t</sub>with his&nbsp;wife and four children.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In his new residence he became legal adviser to Anne of Saxony, the second wife of the prince of Orange, William the&nbsp;Silent. Before long it was discovered that their relations were&nbsp;not purely of a business kind. Thrown into the dungeons of&nbsp;Dillenburg, Rubens lingered there for many months, his wife,&nbsp;Maria Pypelincx, never relaxing her endeavours to get the&nbsp;undutiful husband restored to freedom. Two years elapsed&nbsp;before the prisoner was released, and then only to be confined&nbsp;to the small town of Siegen. Here he lived with his family&nbsp;from 1573 to 1578, and here Maria Pypelincx gave birth to&nbsp;Philip, afterwards town-clerk of Antwerp, and Peter Paul. A&nbsp;year after (May 1578) the Antwerp lawyer got leave to return&nbsp;to Cologne, where he died on the 18th of March 1587, after&nbsp;having, it is said, returned to Roman Catholicism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens went to Antwerp with his mother when he was scarcely ten years of age. He was an excellent Latin scholar,&nbsp;and also proficient in French, Italian, Spanish, English, German&nbsp;and Dutch. Part of his boyhood he spent as a page in the&nbsp;household of the countess of Lalaing, in Brussels; but tradition&nbsp;adds that his mother allowed him to follow his proper vocation,&nbsp;choosing as his master Tobias Verhaecht. Not the slightest&nbsp;trace of this first master’s influence can be detected in Rubens’s&nbsp;works. Not so with Adam Van Noort, to whom the young&nbsp;man was next apprenticed. Van Noort, whose aspect of&nbsp;energy is well known through Van Dyck’s beautiful etching,&nbsp;was the highly esteemed master of numerous painters—among&nbsp;them Van Balen, Sebastian Vrancx, and Jordaens, later bis&nbsp;son-in-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens remained with Van Noort for the usual period of four years, thereafter studying under Otto Vaenius or Van&nbsp;Veen, a gentleman by birth, a most distinguished Latin scholar&nbsp;and a painter of very high repute. He was a native of Leiden,&nbsp;and only recently settled in Antwerp. Though Rubens never&nbsp;adopted his style of painting, the tastes of master and pupil&nbsp;had much in common, and some pictures by Otto Vaenius can&nbsp;be pointed out as having inspired Rubens at a more advanced&nbsp;period. For example, the “Magdalene anointing Christ’s Feet,”&nbsp;painted for the cathedral at Malaga, and now at the Hermitage&nbsp;in St Petersburg, closely resembles in composition the very&nbsp;important work of Otto Vaenius in the church at Bergues near&nbsp;Dunkirk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1598, Adam Van Noort acting as dean of the Antwerp gild of painters, Rubens was officially recognized as <sup>44</sup> master ”&nbsp;—that is, was allowed to work independently and receive pupils.&nbsp;His style at this early period may be judged from the by no&nbsp;means satisfactory <sup>44</sup> Holy Trinity ” at Antwerp Museum,&nbsp;which already shows his bold, vigorous handling, and the&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> Portrait of a Youth ” in the Munich Pinakothek.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From 1600 to the latter part of 1608 Rubens belonged to the household of Vincenzo Gonzaga, duke of Mantua. The duke,&nbsp;who spent some time at Venice in July 1600, had his attention&nbsp;drawn by one of his courtiers to Rubens’s genius, and immediately&nbsp;induced him to enter his service. The influence of the master’s&nbsp;stay at Mantua was of extreme importance, and cannot be too&nbsp;constantly kept in view in the study of his later works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sent to Rome in 1601, to take copies from Raphael for his master, he was also commissioned to paint several pictures for&nbsp;the church of Santa Croce, by the archduke Albrecht of Austria,&nbsp;sovereign of the Spanish Netherlands, and once, when he was&nbsp;a cardinal, the titular of that see. A copy of <sup>44</sup> Mercury and&nbsp;Psyche ” after Raphael is preserved in the museum at Pesth.&nbsp;The religious paintings— <sup>44</sup> The Invention of the Cross,” <sup>44</sup> The&nbsp;Crowning with Thorns ” and <sup>44</sup> The Crucifixion ”—are to be&nbsp;found in the hospital at Grasse in Provence (Alpes Maritimes).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the beginning of 1603, <sup>44</sup> The Fleming,” as he was termed at Mantua, was sent to Spain with a variety of presents for&nbsp;Philip III. and his minister the duke of Lerma, and thus had&nbsp;opportunity to spend a whole year at Madrid and become acquainted with some of Titian’s masterpieces. Of his own&nbsp;works, known to belong to the same period, in the Madrid&nbsp;Gallery, are <sup>44</sup> Heraclitus ” and “Democritus.” Of Rubens’s&nbsp;abilities so far ba^k as 1604 we get a more complete idea from&nbsp;an immense picture now in the Antwerp Gallery, the <sup>44</sup> Baptism&nbsp;of Our Lord,” originally painted for the Jesuits at Mantua.&nbsp;Here it may he seen to what degree Italian surroundings&nbsp;had influenced the household painter of Vincenzo Gonzaga.&nbsp;Vigorous to the extreme in design, he reminds us of Michelangelo&nbsp;as much as any of the degenerate masters of the Roman school,</span></p>
