<p><span class="font0">were published in their joint names ; the patriarch held a separate court, and always sat at the right hand of the sovereign. The patriarchate was suppressed in 1721 by Peter&nbsp;the Great, who had formed the idea of making himself head&nbsp;of tho church from what he saw in England and other&nbsp;Protestant countries. The reign of Michael was not very&nbsp;eventful ; he employed it wisely in ameliorating the condition of the country, which had recently suffered so much,&nbsp;and in improving the condition of his army. Foreigners&nbsp;began to visit the country in great numbers, and Russia&nbsp;was gradually opening itself to Western civilization.&nbsp;Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden induced the czar to sign a&nbsp;treaty offensive and defensive, and a Swedish ambassador&nbsp;appeared at the Russian court. The sufferings which had&nbsp;been inflicted upon them by the Poles made the Russians&nbsp;eager to join an alliance which was directed against the&nbsp;Roman Catholic religion. In 1629 a French ambassador&nbsp;appeared at Moscow. Dutch and German artisans were&nbsp;taken into the Russian service to assist in the iron-foundries, with special view to the manufacture of cannon.&nbsp;The country swarmed with English merchants who had&nbsp;obtained valuable privileges. Scottish adventurers were to&nbsp;be met with in the Russian army in great numbers.

In Russian documents&nbsp;we find the names of Carmichaels, Hamiltons (frequently&nbsp;in the corrupted Russified form of Khomutoff), Bruces,&nbsp;Gordons, and Dalziels. From Scottish settlers in Russia&nbsp;sprang the celebrated poet Lermontoff, the first two&nbsp;syllables of whose name fully show his Caledonian origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The following are the leading events of the reign of Alexis, who succeeded to the throne on the death of his&nbsp;father Michael in 1645.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) First comes his codification</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the Russian laws (called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ulozhxnie),</span><span class="font0"> which was based on the preceding codes of Ivans III. and IV. By the order of&nbsp;the czar, a commission of ecclesiastical and lay members&nbsp;was appointed to examine the existing laws, and make any&nbsp;necessary additions, or to adapt to present needs any which&nbsp;had become obsolete. The work was chiefly carried on by&nbsp;Princes Odoievski and Volkonski, with the assistance of two&nbsp;secretaries. They were engaged over it two months and&nbsp;a half, and the original code is still preserved in the&nbsp;Oruzhennaia Palata at Moscow. Ustrialoff boasts that,&nbsp;by recognizing the equality of all men in the eyes of the&nbsp;law, it anticipated a principle which was not generally&nbsp;acknowledged in western Europe till the 18th century.&nbsp;This doctrine, however, may be considered as only a&nbsp;natural consequence of autocracy. We are told that&nbsp;Alexis allowed access to all petitioners, and at his favourite&nbsp;village of Kolomenskoe, opposite his bed-room window,&nbsp;was placed a tin box ; as soon as the czar rose and appeared&nbsp;at the window the suppliants came forward with their&nbsp;complaints, and, making an obeisance, placed them in&nbsp;the box, which was afterwards taken to him. (2) The&nbsp;second great event of his reign was the incorporation of&nbsp;the Ukraine and country of the Cossacks with Russia.&nbsp;For a description of the causes of this war, see Poland.&nbsp;(3) By the treaty of Andruszowo the Russians gained&nbsp;Smolensk, Tchernigoff, and finally Kieff, the Dnieper&nbsp;being the new boundary, and thus the towns which had&nbsp;been taken by the Lithuanians and annexed to Poland&nbsp;by the treaty of Lublin (1569) became Russian again.&nbsp;The only other events of the reign of Alexis of any&nbsp;importance are the great riot at Moscow, on account of&nbsp;the depreciation of the coinage in 1648, and the rebellion&nbsp;of Stenka Razin, a Cossack. The riot is fully described&nbsp;in the interesting letter of an eyewitness which is preserved in the Ashmolean Collection at Oxford. Razin&nbsp;devastated the country round the Volga, and continued his&nbsp;depredations for three years. Alexis, however, captured&nbsp;him, and pardoned him on condition of his taking the oath&nbsp;of allegiance. He soon, however, broke out into rebellion&nbsp;again, and proclaimed himself the enemy of the nobles, and&nbsp;the restorer of the liberty of the people. By various artifices he succeeded in alluring two hundred thousand men&nbsp;to his standard. Astrakhan was surrendered to him, and&nbsp;he ruled from Nijni-Novgorod to Kazan. He was,&nbsp;however, like Pugatcheff in the reign of Catherine II., a&nbsp;vulgar robber and nothing more. His atrocities disgusted&nbsp;the more respectable of his adherents; his forces were&nbsp;gradually dispersed, and in 1671 he was taken to Moscow&nbsp;and executed. The czar Alexis died in 1676 in his forty-eighth year. One of the most eminent men of his reign&nbsp;was Ordin-Nastchokin, who negotiated the peace of&nbsp;Andruszowo. Alexis was a man of broad views, and made&nbsp;many efforts to raise Russia to the level of a European&nbsp;power, by sending competent men as ambassadors to&nbsp;foreign parts, and developing the trade of the country.&nbsp;In these respects he resembled Boris Godunoff. Altogether&nbsp;his reign was one of distiuct progress for Russia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was succeeded by his eldest son Feodor, by his first wife Maria Miloslavskaia. Feodor (1676-1682) was a&nbsp;prince of weak health, and his reign was uneventful. A&nbsp;notable occurrence was the destruction of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tozriadnie&nbsp;knigi,</span><span class="font0"> or books of pedigrees. According to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vιiestni-chestυο</span><span class="font0"> no man could take any office which was inferior to&nbsp;any which his ancestors had held, or could be subordinate&nbsp;to any man who reckoned fewer ancestors than himself.&nbsp;Feodor, however, finding to what interminable quarrels&nbsp;these pedigrees gave rise, both at court and in the camp,&nbsp;hit upon a bold plan, said to have been suggested by his&nbsp;minister Vasilii Golitzin. He caused all the families to&nbsp;deliver their pedigrees into court that they might be&nbsp;examined, under pretext of ridding them of any errors&nbsp;which might have crept in. The nobles were convoked ;&nbsp;and the czar, assisted by the clergy, caused their books to&nbsp;be burned before their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the death of Feodor, there seemed every probability that the empire would fall into a complete state of anarchy.&nbsp;The czar Alexis had been twice married : his first wife&nbsp;Maria Miloslavskaia bore him two sons, Feodor and Ivan,&nbsp;and several daughters ; his second, Natalia Narishkina,&nbsp;was the mother of Peter and a daughter Natalia. The&nbsp;court was rent by the rival factions of the Miloslavskis and&nbsp;the Narishkins. Ivan was even more infirm than Feodor&nbsp;and the Narishkins strove to bring it about that he should&nbsp;be set aside and Peter should be elected. Sophia, however,&nbsp;the daughter of Alexis by his first wife, was a woman of&nbsp;singular energy of character, the more remarkable on&nbsp;account of the little attention paid to the education of&nbsp;women in Russia and the cloistered and spiritless lives&nbsp;they were compelled to lead. According to some accounts&nbsp;she was a woman altogether wanting in personal attractions. Perry, however, the engineer employed by&nbsp;Peter the Great, speaks of her as good-looking. But the&nbsp;position of the women of the imperial family was even&nbsp;worse than that of the generality ; they were not allowed&nbsp;to marry subjects, and in consequence the majority of&nbsp;them led a life of enforced celibacy. Sophia was the&nbsp;favourite daughter of her father, and was assiduous in her&nbsp;attentions to him during his last illness. One of her&nbsp;brothers being an imbecile and the other a child, she hoped&nbsp;to wield the sceptre. She fomented a revolt of the streltzî,&nbsp;and, instigated by her harangues, they murdered some of&nbsp;the family and partisans of the Narishkins. Not content&nbsp;with slaying one of the czarina’s brothers at the beginning&nbsp;of the rebellion, they afterwards dragged another from his&nbsp;hiding-place and cut him to pieces.</span></p>
