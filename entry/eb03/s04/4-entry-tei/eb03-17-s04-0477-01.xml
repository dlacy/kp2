 in the materia medica, a fine aſtringent bole. It is very heavy, of a firm compact texture, and in colour of a browniſh yellow. It breaks eaſily between the fingers, and does not ſtain the hands ; is naturally of a ſmooth ſurface, is readily diffuſible in water, and melts freely into a butter-like ſubſtance in the mouth. It leaves no grittineſs between the teeth, and does not ferment with acid menſtrua. It is found in the perpendicular fissures of rocks near the goldmines at Strigonium in Hungary, and is ſuppoſed to be impregnated with the ſulphur of that metal. It is a good aſtringent, and better than moſt of the boles in uſe.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
