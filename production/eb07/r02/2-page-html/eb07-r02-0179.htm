<p><span class="font0">supported by two magnificent columns, and two pilasters of giallo antico, are truly beautiful ; but the niches in the intermediate spaces are wretchedly mean, and in&nbsp;bad taste. Behind the altars which crowd the principal&nbsp;recesses, are placed on shelves the busts of the most distinguished men of modern Italy. The pavement, which&nbsp;is supposed to be the work of Septimius Severus, is composed of porphyry and yellow marble, and of pavonazzetto,&nbsp;laid down in large slabs, alternately round and square. The&nbsp;splendid dome which rises over the whole is still uninjured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A large circular aperture at the top, surrounded with a girth of metal, admits a flood of light sufficient to illuminate&nbsp;the whole building. The remains of Raphael are interred&nbsp;in the Pantheon, together with many of those whose names&nbsp;reflected lustre on modern Italy in her proudest days. The&nbsp;situation of the Pantheon is extremely unfavourable. It&nbsp;is sunk in the dirtiest part of modem Rome. The congregated filth of the pavement, the incessant uproar, and&nbsp;the crowds of clamorous beggars, tend materially to lessen&nbsp;the enthusiasm with which the spectator gazes upon this&nbsp;monument of the taste and magnificence of antiquity. Yet&nbsp;in spite of all this, and of the dilapidations which it has suffered from the lapse of eighteen centuries, and the rapacity&nbsp;of barbarians, still, under every disadvantage, it is pre-eminently beautiful. “ The pure and perfect architecture, the&nbsp;greatness of design, the harmony, the simplicity, and the&nbsp;imposing majesty of the whole, command our never satiated&nbsp;admiration, our approbation, and our praise.” “ Though&nbsp;plundered of all its brass, except the ring which preserves&nbsp;the aperture above ; though it has been twice the prey of&nbsp;fire ; though it is always open to the rain, and is sometimes&nbsp;flooded by the river, yet no monument of equal antiquity is&nbsp;so well preserved as this rotondo.”@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Near the Tiber there is a beautiful little temple, popularly called the temple of Vesta, though no satisfactory reason can be given for the designation. Its form and elegance have been much admired ; and bronze models of the&nbsp;“ little temple of Vesta” are dispersed over most of Europe. It is entirely built of Parian marble, and its portico&nbsp;is composed of a circular colonnade of twenty fluted Corinthian columns. Of these only one is wanting ; but all the&nbsp;architrave is lost. The small circular cell within the colonnade is now converted into a chapel, dedicated to “ La Madonna dell’ Sole,” (the virgin of the sun.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Opposite to this beautiful building, stands the church of St. Maria in Cosmedin, built by Adrian I. on the ruins of&nbsp;an ancient temple, the name of which is unknown. It appears, like the Pantheon, to have eight columns, and fifteen at the sides. Six of the front columns of the most&nbsp;beautiful Parian marble may still be traced, built up into&nbsp;this hideous compound of deformity and bad taste. The&nbsp;church of S. Maria Egizziaca has been formed out of another ancient temple, which is usually called by the name&nbsp;of Fortuna Virilis. On that ruin-covered spot, which&nbsp;now bears the name of the Roman Forum, but without its&nbsp;ancient limits, stands the temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It is a fine specimen of ancient architecture. Its&nbsp;noble portico, which, though entire, has evidently suffered&nbsp;from fire, is composed of six Corinthian columns of Cippol-lino marble in front, and two on each side. The exquisite&nbsp;chiseling of the friese and cornice, tlle sculptured griffins,&nbsp;candelabros, vases, &amp;c. which form the ornaments, are&nbsp;scarcely equalled in any Roman monument of the kind in&nbsp;existence. A little farther on is the church of the saints&nbsp;Cosmo and Damiano, supposed to be the double temple of&nbsp;Romulus and Remus. Near the Coliseum are the remains</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">of Hadrian’s magnificent temple of Venus and Rome.@@<sup>2 </sup>Some striking ruins of the interior of the fabric still exist&nbsp;in the middle of the site. Pope Honorius I. covered the&nbsp;whole of St. Peter’s basilica with bronze tablets which he&nbsp;took from the roof of this temple.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many other ruins of the magnificent temples of ancient Rome are scattered throughout the city, but their remains&nbsp;are so scanty that it is impossible to obtain any information&nbsp;respecting their origin or extent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Various temporary theatres seem to have been erected at different times in Rome, but the first that was built of&nbsp;stable materials in this city was the theatre of Pompey. It&nbsp;was rebuilt by Tiberius, and again by Claudius, but there&nbsp;is not a single vestige of it now remaining. The theatre&nbsp;of Marcellus was built by Augustus, who named it after his&nbsp;nephew, whose death has been commemorated by Virgil in&nbsp;such pathetic strains.@@<sup>3</sup> Of this once magnificent edifice&nbsp;nothing now remains except a very small portion of the&nbsp;two lower arcades, which are considered models of architecture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ancient Rome possessed a number of noble porticos, but all that now remains of these is a fragment of the portico of Octavio. It originally consisted of a double line of&nbsp;marble columns covered width a roof, so as to afford shelter&nbsp;to those who walked within it. In the open square stood&nbsp;the temples of Jupiter and Juno, the first in Rome that&nbsp;were built of marble. Here were exhibited many splendid&nbsp;paintings and statues ; and this portico contained one of&nbsp;the three public libraries which Rome possessed in the Augustan age. The only remains of this magnificent building are four Corinthian columns, and three pilasters of beautiful marble, with a part of the ancient pediment. They&nbsp;stand in what a modem traveller has pronounced tlle “ filthiest spot upon the whole face of the globe—the pescheria&nbsp;or fishmarket, the crowded quarter where the Jews are condemned to reside.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It has been justly said that no monument of ancient architecture is calculated to inspire such an exalted idea of Roman magnificence, as the ruins of their thermæ, or baths.&nbsp;These magnificent structures were not, however, erected&nbsp;for bathing alone ; but in them there were rooms for almost every kind of athletic exercises ; walks shaded by&nbsp;rows of trees ; fountains adorned with statues and precious&nbsp;marbles ; libraries ; spacious halls and vestibules decorated&nbsp;with the finest objects of art, where poets recited, orators&nbsp;declaimed, and philosophers lectured. A splendid description has been given by Pliny of the sculptures and paintings, the magnificent seats of solid silver, the silver pipes&nbsp;and baths, the polished vases, the pavements of precious&nbsp;stones, and all the sumptuous decorations of these magnificent buildings dedicated to the luxury and idleness of the&nbsp;Romans.@@<sup>4</sup> The thermae of ancient Rome are known to&nbsp;have stood in all their original magnificence so late as the&nbsp;fourth century, and their destruction seems to have been&nbsp;almost entirely owing to the rapacity of the modern Romans. Of all the thermae that adorned imperial Rome,&nbsp;the ruins of those of Titus, Diocletian, and Caracalla, are&nbsp;all that now remain in any considerable degree of preservation. The thermae of Caracalla are situated at the base&nbsp;of Mount Aventine, on the Via Appia. They were left incomplete by Caracalla, and were finished by Heliogabalus,&nbsp;and by Alexander Severus.@@<sup>5</sup> These baths, together with&nbsp;the outworks, were one mile in circumference, and their&nbsp;ruins still cover a vast extent of ground ; but it is impossible to form from them any idea of the peculiar destination&nbsp;of the particular parts. They form a succession of immense</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
