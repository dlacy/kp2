<hi rend="italic">(ſcrud</hi> Sax.), a range of large ropes extending from the maſt-heads to the right and left side of the ſhip, to ſupport the masts, and enable them to carry sail, &amp; c.</p><p>The ſhrouds as well as the ſails are denominated from the masts to which they belong. Thus they are the main, fore, and mizen ſhrouds ; the main-top-maſt, fore-top-maſt, or mizen -top-maſt ſhrouds ; and the main-top-gallant, fore-top-gallant, or mizen-top-gallant ſhrouds. The number of ſhrouds by which a mast is ſuſtained, as well as the ſize of rope of which they are formed, is always in proportion to the ſize of the mast and the weight of the sail it is intended to carry.</p><p>Bowſprit ſhrouds are thoſe which ſupport the bow- ſprit. Bumkin ſhrouds are thoſe which ſupport the bumkins. Futtock ſhrouds are ſhrouds which connect the efforts of the topmaſt ſhrouds to the lower ſhrouds. Bentinck-ſhrouds are additional ſhrouds to ſupport the maſts in heavy gales. Preventer ſhrouds are ſimilar to bentinck-ſhrouds, and are uſed in bad weather to eaſe the lower rigging.
