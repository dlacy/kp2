She was accompanied by Mrs Dingley, a person in humble circumstances, and of feeble capacity, whose presence was designed to obviate calumny. Swift and Stella never met but in the presence of this or of some other third party : when he was absent, she and her friend lived in his parsonage, and shifted their quarters on his return. A rival in the affections of Stella appeared in Dr William Tisdale, <hi rend="italic">a</hi> clergyman, whose notions on the subject of love resembled those of ordinary mortals. But Swift could not endure to see in the arms of another, a woman who would gladly have thrown herself into his own ; and by his machinations this vulgar suitor was rejected. These tortuous ways, however, never conducted him to happiness ; and with all his caution, Swift was only laying up for himself a fund of obloquy.</p><p>Excepting a few poetical essays, which cannot be called the foundation of his literary fame, Swift had hitherto published nothing. In 1701, when he was in his thirty-fourth year, appeared the “ Dissensions in Athens and Rome.” This work, which excited much attention, was attributed to Burnet. Some critics, still more undiscerning, afterwards fathered upon Swift the Characteristics of Shaftesbury, whose general manner of writing is as verbose, ambitious, and declamatory, as that of Swift is concise, simple, and didactic ; whose pleasantry is languid and insipid, while the sarcasm of Swift is withering, and his irony irresistible.</p><p>In 1704 was published “ A Tale of a Tub.” There cannot be a doubt that Swift thought this performance calculated to serve the Church of England ; but he executed his task in a manner so likely to produce ludicrous impressions of religion in general, that Voltaire immediately extended to him the right hand of fellowship, and hailed him as “ le Rabelais d’Angleterre.” And the weapons with which he assails the Catholics and Presbyterians are not much more dignified than the flail and urinal with which he has equipped Bentley in the Battle of the Books. But whether this production is fitted to promote the interests of piety or retard them, it is scarcely hyperbolical to say, that to produce the same quantity of wit and humour in the same space, the exchequer of human knowledge would be ransacked in vain. His literary offspring, however, being more beautiful than exemplary, Swift had no wish to own it ; but a clerical namesake and relation of his, who was willing to acquire the reputation of a wit, at the expense of being considered a little profane, confessed that he had some share in the composition of the Tale of a Tub. But those who were willing to take his own word for his impiety, had strong doubts of his wit ; and his self-accusation may now be treated as modem judges treat the confessions of old women who acknowledge having dealings with the evil one.</p><p>The hint of the Battle of the Books was said to have been taken from Coutray’s “ Histoire Poétique de la Guerre nouvellement déclarée entre les Anciens et les Modernes.” Johnson has given ear to this assertion ; but the works of Coutray and Swift are more dissimilar from each other than Rasselas and Candide. The “ Dissertation on the Mechanical Operation of the Spirit,” is written in Swift’s happiest vein, and his blows are aimed with good will.</p><p><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note>Swift was employed by Archbishop King and the Irish prelacy, to solicit the remission of the first fruits and twentieth parts, in order to augment the incomes of the poorer clergy. But the experiment had been tried in England without converting the ecclesiastics from Toryism ; and Godolphin declined conferring a like expensive favour on the Irish divines, many of whom he suspected to be disaffected to the government as well as the ministry. Finding that this ne- gociation in behalf of his brethren was a hopeless undertaking, Swift endeavoured to promote his own interest in the best way he could. He had some prospect of being appointed secretary of an embassy to Vienna; but Lord Berkeley, whom he was to accompany, was detained in England by the infirmities of age. Interest was next exerted to procure his nomination as bishop of Virginia ; but that scheme also proved abortive. He was now convinced that the Whigs would do nothing for him. Disgusted with compliments that could not long cajole a man of his penetration and knowledge of the world, and tired of waiting for the fulfilment of promises made with all the alacrity, and performed with the usual punctuality of a court, Swift returned, in no enviable frame of mind, to his Irish parsonage. During his stay in London, however, he had written his “ Project for the Advancement of Religion which in some parts is more Utopian than might have been expected from his pen.Swift was not long buried in the solitude of Laracor ; for in 1710 he returned to England, being associated in the commission with the bishops of Ossory and Killaloe, who, in the impending change of ministry, were sent to renew the suit which he had formerly preferred without success. It was arranged that if the two bishops should leave London without bringing the matter to a satisfactory issue, Swift should remain to negociate with government to the best of his ability.On the 1st of September 1710, he left Ireland, and on the 9th of that month reached London, where he was speedily plunged in business. His Journal to Stella, one of the most singular records that have been submitted to public inspection, gives a minute account of this stirring period of his history. With the exception of Godolphin, whose calm indifference had probably accelerated his political apostasy, the Whigs treated him with marked respect. But the politeness of those who seemed resolved to starve him into hostility when they were in a condition to be of service to him, he estimated at its real value. Somers stooped to make explanations which Swift did not think satisfactory ; and Godolphin’s disdain he endeavoured to humble by means of a lampoon. He was soon afterwards introduced to Harley, refusing on the same day an invitation from Lord Halifax. Harley made him acquainted with St John, and both evinced the utmost eagerness to bind him to their interests. Swift asserted with great composure, that although a Whig in politics, he had always been a Tory in church affairs. A man that goes over to a victorious enemy, must say something to his new comrades, who, if his services are of any value, will readily admit his apologies : on his former associates his eloquence will in all likelihood be thrown away. From his Journal to Stella, it is manifest that Swift’s standard of political consistency was extremely low, and that he was ready to grasp the hand, whatever cause it maintained, that had any thing to give, or that could apply a balsam to the wounds of pride.To prop the interest of the new rulers, Swift was required to conduct the Examiner, which was the organ of the ministerial party. Addison for some time opposed that publication in a paper called the Whig Examiner, but withdrew from the contest when he heard that Swift was about to take the field, probably because his gentle spirit detested the thoughts of entering the fists with a friend. Swift conducted the Examiner from the 10th of November 1710,In 1708 appeared “ The Sentiments of a Church of England Man ;” that inimitable ridicule of astrology in general, and of one impostor, Partridge, in particular, “ Predictions for the year 1708, by Isaac Bickerstaff, Esq.,” a name afterwards adopted by Steele in the Tatler ; “ An Argument against abolishing Christianity,” one of his happiest efforts in the ironical style ; and the “ Letter on the Sacramental Test.” The publication of the last-mentioned tract was regarded as a signal of retreat from the standard of the Whigs ; and, with the exception of the dispassionate Addison, all his friends of that party became cold and estranged. Nor were their suspicions unfounded. During this year</p></body></text></TEI>
