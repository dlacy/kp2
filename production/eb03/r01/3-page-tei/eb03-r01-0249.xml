At the ſeme time, they detached a ſquadron of their beſt ſhips, under the command of Amyntas, who made over to the continent of Alia ; and there meeting with ſome privateers who were commiſſioned by Demetrius, took both the ſhips and the men, among whom were Timocles the chief of the pirates, and ſeveral other officers of diſtinction belonging to the fleet of Demetrius. On their return, they fell in with ſeveral veſſels laden with corn for the enemy’s camp, which they likewiſe took,, and brought into the port. Theſe were ſoon followed by a numerous fleet of ſmall veſſels loaded with corn and proviſions ſent them by Ptolemy, together with 1500 men, commanded by Antigonus a Macedonian of great experience in military affairs.— Demetrius, in the mean time, having repaired his machines, brought them up anew to the walls ; which he inceſſantly battered till he opened a great breach and threw down ſeveral towers. But when he came to the aſſault, the Rhodians, under the command of Aminias, defended themfelves with ſuch refolution and intrepidity, that he was in three ſucceſſive attacks repulſed with great laughter, and at laſt forced to retire. The Rhodians likewiſe, on this occaſion, loſt ſeveral officers ; and amongſt others, the brave Aminias their commander.</p><p>while the Rhodians were thus ſignalizing 'them-ſelves in the defence of their country, a ſecond embaſſy arrived at the camp of Demetrius from Athens and the other cities of Greece, ſoliciting Demetrius to compote matters, and ſtrike up a peace with the Rhodians. At the requeſt of the ambaſſadors, who were in all above 50, a ceſſation of arms was agreed upon; but the terms offered by Demetrius being anew rejected by the Rhodians, the ambaſſadors returned home without being able to bring the contending parties to an agreement. Hoſtilities were therefore renewed; and Demetrius, whoſe imagination was fertile in expedients for ſucceeding in his projects, formed a detachment of 1500 of his beſt troops, under the conduct of Alcimus and Mancius, two officers of great reſolution and <hi rend="italic">experience,</hi>  ordering them to enter the breach at mid-night, and, forcing the entrenchment behind it, to poſſeſs themſelves of the polls about the theatre, where it would be no difficult matter to maintain themſelves againſt any efforts of the townſmen. In order to facilitate the execution of fo important and dangerous an undertaking, and amuſe the enemy with falſe attacks, he at the ſame time, upon a ſignal given, ordered the reft of the army to ſet up a ſhout, and attack the city on all ſides both by ſea and land. By this means he hoped that, the beſieged being alarmed in all parts, his detachment might find an opportunity of forcing the entrenchments which covered the breach, and afterwards of ſeizing the advantageous poll about the theatre. This feint had all the ſucceſs the prince could expect ; for the troops having ſet up a ſhout from all quarters, as if they were advancing to a general nſſault, the detachment commanded by Alcimus and Mancius entered the breach, and fell upon thoſe who defended the ditch, and the wall that covered it, with ſuch vigour, that, having ſlain the moſt part of them and put the reſt in confuſion, they advanced to the theatre, and ſeized on the poſt adjoining to it. This occaſioneda general uproar in the city, as if it hadbeen already taken : but the commanding officers diſpatched orders to the ſoldiers on the ramparts not to quit their poſts, nor ſtir from their reſpective ſtations. Having thus ſecured the walls, they put themſelves at the head of a choſen body of their own troops, and of thoſe who were lately come from Egypt, and with theſe charged the enemy’s detachment. But the darkneſs of the night prevented them from diſlodging the enemy and regaining the advantageous poſts they had ſeized. Day, however, no ſooner appeared, than they renewed their attack with wonderful bravery. The Demetrians without the walls, with loud ſhouts endeavoured to animate thoſe who had entered the place, and inſpire them with resolution to maintain their ground till they were relieved with freſh troops. The Rhodians being ſenſible that their fortunes, liberties, and all that was dear to them in the world, lay at ſtake, fought like men in the utmoſt deſpair, the enemy defending their poſts for ſeveral hours without giving ground in the leaſt. At length the Rhodians, encouraging each other to exert themfelves in defence of their country, and animated by the example of their leaders, made a laſt effort, and, breaking into the very heart of the enemy’s battalion, there killed both their commanders. After their death the reſt were eaſily put in diforder, and all to a man either killed or taken prifoners. The Rhodians like-wile on this occaſion loſt many of their beſt commanders ; and among the reſt Damotetis, their chief magiſtrate, a man of extraordinary valour, who had ſignalized himſelf during the whole time of the ſiege.</p><p>Demetrius, not at all diſcouraged by this check, was making the neceſſary preparations for a new aſſault, when he received letters from his father Antigonus, enjoining him to conclude a peace with the Rhodians upon the beſt terms he could get, left he ſhould loſe his whole army in the ſiege of a lingle town. From this time Demetrius wanted only ſome plauſible pretence for breaking up the ſiege. The Rhodians likewiſe were now more inclined to come to an agreement than formerly ; Ptolemy having acquainted them that he intended to tend a great quantity of corn, and 3000 men to their aſſiſtance, but that he would firſt have them try whether they could make up matters with Demetrius upon reaſonable terms. At the fame time ambaſſadors arrived from the Ætolian republic, ſoliciting the contending parties to put an cnd to a war which might involve all the eaſt in endleſs calamities.</p><p>An accident which happened to Demetrius in this conjuncture, did not a little contribute towards the wiſhed-for pacification. This prince was preparing to advance his helepolis againſt the city, when a Rhodian engineer found means to render it quite uſeleſs. He undermined the tract of ground over which the helepolis was to paſs the next day in order to approach the walls. Demetrius, not ſuſpecting any ſtratagem of this nature, cauſed the engine to be moved forward, which coming to the place that was undermined, ſunk ſo deep into the ground that it was impoſſible to draw it out again. This misfortune, if we believe Vegetius and Vitruvius, determined Demetrius to hearken to the Ætolian ambaſſadors, and at laſt to ſtrike up a peace upon the following conditions: That the republic of Rhodes ſhould be maintained in the full enjoyment of their ancient rights, privileges, and liberties, without any foreign garriſon ; that they ſhould renew their ancient alliance</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
