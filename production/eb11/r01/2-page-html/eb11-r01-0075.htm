<p><span class="font1">purposes: they diminish the wear of the sleeper under the rail by providing a larger bearing surface, and they help to support&nbsp;the spikes and so to keep the gauge. On all the accepted forms&nbsp;there are two or more flanges at the bottom, running lengthwise&nbsp;of the plate and crosswise of the rail; these are requisite to give&nbsp;proper stiffness, and further, as they are forced into the tie by&nbsp;the weight of passing traffic, they help to fix the plate securely&nbsp;in place. The joints of flanged rails are similar to those employed&nbsp;with bull-headed rails. Various forms, mostly patented, have&nbsp;been tried in the United States, but the one most generally&nbsp;adopted consists of two symmetrical angle bars (fig. 13),&nbsp;varying in length (from 20 to&nbsp;48 in. ), in weight and in the&nbsp;number of bolts, which may be four</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The substitution of steel for iron as the material for rails which made possible the axle loads and&nbsp;the speeds of to-day, and, by&nbsp;reducing the cost of maintenance,&nbsp;contributed enormously to the&nbsp;economic efficiency of railways,&nbsp;was one of the most important&nbsp;events in the history of railways,&nbsp;and a scarcely less important element of progressive economy has&nbsp;been the continued improvement of the steel rail in stiffness of&nbsp;section and in toughness and hardness of material. Carbon is&nbsp;the important element in controlling hardness, and the amount&nbsp;present is in general higher in the United States than in Great&nbsp;Britain. The specifications for bull-headed rails issued by the&nbsp;British Engineering Standards Committee in 1904 provided for a&nbsp;carbon-content ranging from 0∙35 to 0∙50%, with a phosphorus&nbsp;maximum of 0∙075%. In the United States a committee of&nbsp;the American Society of Civil Engineers, appointed to consider&nbsp;the question of rail manufacture in consequence of an increase&nbsp;in the number of rail-failures, issued an interim report in 1907&nbsp;in which it suggested a range of carbon from 0∙55 to 0∙65%for&nbsp;the heaviest sections of Bessemer steel flange rails, with a&nbsp;phosphorus maximum of 0·085%; while the specifications of&nbsp;the American Society for Testing Materials, current at the same&nbsp;period, put the carbon limits at 0∙45 to 0∙55%, and the phosphorus limit at 0·10. For rails of basic open-hearth steel,&nbsp;which is rapidly ousting Bessemer steel, the Civil Engineers’&nbsp;specifications allowed from 0∙65 to 0∙75% of carbon with 0·05%&nbsp;of phosphorus, while the specifications of the American Railway&nbsp;Engineering and Maintenance of Way Association provided for&nbsp;a range of 0∙75 to 0∙85% of carbon, with a maximum of 0∙03%&nbsp;of phosphorus. The rail-failures mentioned above also drew&nbsp;renewed attention to the importance of the thermal treatment&nbsp;of the steel from the time of melting to the last passage through&nbsp;the rolling mill and to the necessity of the finishing temperature&nbsp;being sufficiently low if the product is to be fine grained, homogeneous and tough; and to permit of this requirement being met&nbsp;there was a tendency to increase the thickness of the metal in&nbsp;the web and flanges of the rails. The standard specification&nbsp;adopted by the Pennsylvania railway in 1908 provided that in&nbsp;rails weighing 100 ℔ to the yard 41 % of the metal should be&nbsp;in the head, 18∙6% in the web, and 40∙4% in the base, while&nbsp;for 85 lb rails 42∙2% was to be in the head, 17∙8% in the web&nbsp;and 40·0% in the base. These rails were to be rolled in 33-ft.&nbsp;lengths. According to the specification for 85 lb rails adopted by&nbsp;the Canadian Pacific railway about the same time, 36∙77% of&nbsp;the metal was to be in the head, 22·21 % in the web and 41·02%</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Points and Crossings. </span><span class="font1">—To enable trains to be transferred from one pair of rails to another pair, as from the main line&nbsp;to a siding, “ points ” or “ switches ” are provided. At the&nbsp;place where the four rails come together, the two inner ones&nbsp;(one of the main line and the other of the siding), known as&nbsp;“ switch rails ” (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1">, fig. 14), are tapered to a fine point or tongue,&nbsp;and rigidly connected together at such a distance apart that&nbsp;when one of the points is pressed against the outer or “stock’<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;rail (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1">) of either the siding or the main line there is sufficient&nbsp;space between the other tongue and the other stock rail to&nbsp;permit the free passage of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the flanges of the wheels</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">on one side of the train,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">while the flanges on the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">other side find a con</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">tinuous path along the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">other switch rail and thus</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">are deflected in the desired</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">direction. The same ar</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rangement is employed</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">at junctions where differ</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">which a train travels when</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">directed from the main</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to a branch line are called</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ facing points ” &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(FP),</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">when running from a</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">branch to a main line arc</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">In Great Britain the Board</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of Trade requires facing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">points to be avoided as</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">far as possible; but, of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">course, they are a neces</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">running lines diverge and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">at the crossing places</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">to enable trains to pass</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">each other on single-track</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">lines. At stations the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">points that give access</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">to sidings are generally</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">arranged as trailing points</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">with respect to the direc</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">tion of traffic on the main</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">lines; that is, trains can</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">not pass direct into sidings,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">but have to stop and then run backwards into them. In shunting yards the points are commonly set in the required&nbsp;direction by means of hand levers placed close beside the&nbsp;lines, but those at junctions and those which give access&nbsp;from the main lines to sidings at wayside stations are worked&nbsp;by a system of rods from the signal cabin, or by electric or&nbsp;pneumatic power controlled from it and interlocked with the&nbsp;signals (see Signal: § </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Railway).</span><span class="font1"> Crossings are inevitable&nbsp;adjuncts of points. Where a branch diverges from a main&nbsp;line, one rail of the one must cross one rail of the other, and a&nbsp;V-crossing is formed </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(V). </span><span class="font1">Where, as at a double-line junction,&nbsp;one pair of rails crosses another pair, “ diamond ” crossings (D)&nbsp;are formed. At both types of crossing, check rails (c) must be&nbsp;provided to guide the wheel-flanges, and if these are not accurately placed the safety of the trains will be endangered. At&nbsp;double-line junctions trains passing over the diamond crossings&nbsp;evidently block traffic going in the opposite direction to that&nbsp;in which they are travelling. To avoid the delay thus caused&nbsp;the branch line which would occasion the diamond crossing&nbsp;if it were taken across on the level is sometimes carried over&nbsp;the main line by an over-bridge (“ flying junction ”) or under&nbsp;it by an under-bridge (“ burrowing junction”).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Railway Stations. —</span><span class="font1">Railway stations are either “ terminal ” or “ intermediate. ” A terminal station embraces (1) the&nbsp;passenger station; (2) the goods station; (3) the locomotive,&nbsp;carriage and waggon depots, where the engines and the carrying&nbsp;stock are kept, cleaned, examined and repaired. At many&nbsp;intermediate stations the same arrangements, on a smaller&nbsp;scale, are made; in all of them there is at least accommodation for the passenger and the goods traffic.
