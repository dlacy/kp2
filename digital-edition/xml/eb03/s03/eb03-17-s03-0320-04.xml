or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sets,</hi> a term uſed by the farmers and gardeners to expreſs the young plants of the white thorn and other ſhrubs, with which they uſe to raiſe their quick or quick-ſet hedges. The white thorn is the belt of all trees for this purpose ; and, under proper regulations, its ſets ſeldom fail of anſwering the farmer’s utmoſt expectations.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SET-off,</hi> in law, is an act whereby the defendant acknowledges the juſtice of the plaintiff’s demand on the one hand ; but, on the other, ſets up a demand of his own, to counterbalance that of the plaintiff, either in the whole, or in part : as, if the plaintiff ſues for 10l. due on a note of hand, the defendant may ſet off 91. due to himſelf for merchandiſe ſold to the plaintiff; and, in cafe he pleads ſuch ſet-off, muſt pay the remaining balance into court. This anſwers very nearly to the <hi rend="italic">compenſatio</hi> or ſtoppage of the civil law, and depends upon the ſtatutes 2 Geo. II. cap. 22. and 8 Geo. II. cap. 24.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
