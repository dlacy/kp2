<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ther a god or a man, a brute or </span><span class="font2">a plant<sub>ι</sub>j and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">thoſe countries where it was practiſed, men had uſually their&nbsp;names from animals, and were repreſented by their ſt-gure in writing (r). From this laſt ſtage of the pι⅛)-ceſs, a tranſmigration was eaſily ſuppoſed : and hence&nbsp;we hear </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the gods of Egypt wandering about like&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ſo </span><span class="font2">many vagrants in brute ſhapes, and of princes being&nbsp;tranſlated into ſtars, becauſe a ſtar was their emblem&nbsp;in hieroglyphic, or ſtood for their name in figurative lan-guage. And, in like manner, we ſee, from the ſpeci-men of this character -which is ſtill preſerved on ce-leſtial globes, how the heavens aj firſt came to be filled with bears, ſeorpions, and dragons, and with a va-riety of other animals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The opinions concerning the ſtate of the dead are ſtill more numerous than thoſe concerning the place&nbsp;where they reiide. Rude nations have generally thought&nbsp;that the future ſtate is limilar to the preſent; that plants,&nbsp;animals, and inanimate things there, have their ſhades ;&nbsp;and that theſe contribute as much to the pleaſures and&nbsp;conveniences of the dead as their realities do to the li-ving ; that huſhands have their wives (s), lovers their&nbsp;miſtreſſes, warriors their battles, huntſmen their ſport ;&nbsp;and that all their paſſions, amuſements, and bufineſs,&nbsp;are the ſame as formerly. For this reaſon, that the&nbsp;dead may not appear unprovided in the next world,&nbsp;like the ancient Gauls, ſome tribes of India, America,&nbsp;and Africa, bury with them in the ſame grave their&nbsp;wives, their arms, their favourite animals, and their&nbsp;neceffary utenfils.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ί he ancient Egyptians, who believed in tranſmigra-tion, ſuppoſed that the ſoul was after death obliged to animate every ſpecies of bird and quadruped, of reptile&nbsp;and infect, and was not to return to a human form till&nbsp;after a period of 3500 years, others have confined&nbsp;their tranſmigrations to particular animals, as the ſoul&nbsp;oſ man to the human form, and the ſoul of the brute to&nbsp;the bodies of the ſpecies to which it belonged. Some&nbsp;bave changed the brute into man, and man into the&nbsp;brute, that man might ſuffer injuries ſimilar to what he&nbsp;had inflicted, and the brute retaliate what he had ſuffered. others have confined the human ſoul in plants&nbsp;and in ftones ; and Bell of Antermony mentions an&nbsp;Indiau who ſuppoſed that his anceſtors might be in&nbsp;fiſhes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The notions of Homer were probably thoſe of many of his time. But theſe notions were difimd indeed, when&nbsp;his hero Ulyffes vifited the ſhades, many of the ghoſts&nbsp;ſeemed to retain the mangled and ghaſtly appearance&nbsp;which they </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">had ct </span><span class="font2">death </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5 and, what is worſe, feemed&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">to be all ſtarving with hunger, innumerable multitudes,&nbsp;with loud ihrieks, flocking to the fleams of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">lus ſlain vic</span><span class="font2">tim-as to a moſt ſumptuoug and delicious banquet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For ſcarcely had the purple torrent flow’d,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And all the caverns imok’d with ſtreaming blood, when, lo ! appear’d along the duſky coaſts&nbsp;Thin airy flιoals oſ viſionary ghoſts ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fair penfive youths, and ſoft enamour’d maids,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And wither’d elders, pale and wrinkl’d ſhades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ghaſtly with wounds, the forms of warriors ſlain, Stalk’d with majeſtic port, a martial train.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thςfe, and a thouſand more, ſwarrn’d o’er the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ground, </span><span class="font2">And all the dire aſſembly ſhriek’d around.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ulyſſes ſaw, as ghoſt by ghoſt aroſe,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All wailing with unutterable woes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Alone, apart, in diſcontented mood,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A gloomy ihade, the ſullen Ajax ſtood ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For ever fad, with proud diidain he pin’d,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And the loſt arms lor ever ſtung his mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Upon Ulyfſts faying to Achilles,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Alive, we hail’d thee with our guardian gods ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And, dead, thou rul’ſt a king in theſe abodes ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Thefhade replfd :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Talk not of ruling in this dol’rous gloom,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nor think vain words (he cry’d) can eaſe my doom ; Rather I ehυυfe laboriouſly to bear</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A weight of woes, and breathe the vital air,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A slave to some poor hind that toils for bread. Than live a scepter’d monarch of the dead.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this gloomy region no one is rewarded for his virtue, nor is puniſhed for his crimes, unleſs committed, like thoſe of Siſyphus, Tantalus, and Ixion, againſt&nbsp;the gods. AU indeed are claifed into groups, from a&nbsp;certain analogy of age, fex, fate, and diſpolition ; but&nbsp;all appear to be equally unhappy, having their whole&nbsp;heart and affections concentrated in a world to which&nbsp;they are fated never to return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Elyfιum of Homer is allotted only for the rela-tions and deſcendants of the gods ; and Menelaus goes to this country of perpetual ſpring (τ), not as a perlon of&nbsp;ſuperior merit, but becauſe he had married the daughter&nbsp;of Jove.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Even long after a future ſtate had become the ſcene of rewards and puniſhments, theſe for the moſt part&nbsp;were diſtributed, not according to moral, but phyfical&nbsp;diſtinctions. with the Greeks and Romans,.the ſoul&nbsp;was condemned to many calamities for a number of</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(r)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A military gentleman who refided at Penobſcot during the late American war, aſſured us that the Indians, when defired to ſubfcribe a written agreement, drew always the picture of the object or animal whoſe&nbsp;name they bore. But for fuller information on this ſubject, ſee Clavigero’s Hiſt. of Mexico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(s) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The queſtion which the Sadducees put to our Saviour about the wile of the ſeven brothers, is a proof</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">that the Phariſees thought there was marriage and giving in marriage in the future ſtate, and that it was ſome-what ſimilar to the preſent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(τ) Homer fends the ghoſt of Hercules to the ſhades, while Hercules himſelf is quaffing nectar with Hebe in the ſkies. Οηε ſoul of the hero is therefore repining with the ghoſts of mortals in the regions below, while&nbsp;the other is enjoying all the happineſs of the gods above. (See odyssey, B. II. near the end). Philoſophers&nbsp;ſince have improved on this hint oſ the poet ; and men have now got rational, animal, and vegetable ſouls, to&nbsp;which ſometimes a fourth one is added, as properly belonging to matter in general. Homer infιnuateε, that&nbsp;Menelaus was to be tranſiated to Elyſium without taſting death. This Elyſium is the habitation of men, and&nbsp;not of ghoſts, and is </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">deſcribed as being ſimilar to the feat of the gods. Compare </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Odyjſ.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> iv. 1.563. and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Qdyffi</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> vi»&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">1. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">43. in the Greek,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
