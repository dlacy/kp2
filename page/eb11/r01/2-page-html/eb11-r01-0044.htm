<p><span class="font1">separated with another active substance—radium; whilst a third fraction, composed mainly of the rare earths (thorium, &amp;c. ),&nbsp;yielded to Debierne another radioactive element—actinium,&nbsp;which proved to be identical with the emanium of Giesel.&nbsp;Another radioactive substance—ionium—was isolated from carnotite, a uranium mineral, by B. B. Boltwood in 1905. Radioactive properties have also been ascribed to other elements, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e. g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">thorium and lead. There is more radium than any other radio-active element, but its excessive rarity may be gauged by the&nbsp;facts that Mme. Curie obtained only a fraction of a gramme of&nbsp;the chloride and Giesel ∙2 to ∙3 gramme of the bromide from a&nbsp;ton of uranium residues.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is a mass of evidence to show that radium is to be regarded as an element, and in general its properties resemble&nbsp;those of the metals of the alkaline earths, more particularly&nbsp;barium. To the bunsen flame a radium salt imparts an intense&nbsp;carmine-red colour (barium gives a green). The spectrum,&nbsp;also, is very characteristic. The atomic weight, 226‧4, places&nbsp;the element in a vacant position in group II. of the periodic&nbsp;classification, along with the alkaline earth metals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Generally speaking, the radiation is not simple. Radium itself emits three types of rays: (1) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">α</span><span class="font1"> rays, which are&nbsp;regarded as positively charged helium atoms; these rays are&nbsp;stopped by a single sheet of paper; (2) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ß</span><span class="font1"> rays, which are&nbsp;identified with the cathode rays, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i. e</span><span class="font1">. as a single electron charged&nbsp;negatively; these rays can penetrate sheets of aluminium, glass,&nbsp;&amp;c., several millimetres thick; and (3) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">γ</span><span class="font1"> rays—which are&nbsp;non-electrified radiations characterized by a high penetrating&nbsp;power, 1% surviving after traversing 7 cm. of lead or 150 cm.&nbsp;of water. In addition, radium evolves an “ emanation ” which&nbsp;is an extraordinarily inert gas, recalling the “ inactive ” gases&nbsp;of the atmosphere. We thus see that radium is continually&nbsp;losing matter and energy as electricity; it is also losing energy&nbsp;as heat, for, as was observed by Curie and Laborde, the temperature of a radium salt is always a degree or two above that&nbsp;of the atmosphere, and they estimated that a gramme of pure&nbsp;radium would emit about 100 gramme-calories per hour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Becquerel rays have a marked chemical action on certain substances. The Curies showed that oxygen was convertible&nbsp;into ozone, and Sudborough that yellow phosphorus gave the&nbsp;red modification when submitted to their influence. More&nbsp;interesting are the observations of D. Berthelot, F. Bordas,&nbsp;C. Doelter and others, that the rays induce important changes&nbsp;in the colours of many minerals. (See Radioactivity. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The action of radium on human tissues was unknown until 1901, when, Professor Becquerel of Paris having incautiously&nbsp;carried a tube in his waistcoat pocket, there appeared on the&nbsp;skin within fourteen days a severe inflammation which was&nbsp;known as the famous “ Becquerel burn. ” Since that time&nbsp;active investigation into the action of radium on diseased tissues&nbsp;has been carried on, resulting in the establishment in Paris in&nbsp;1906 of the “ Laboratoire biologique du Radium. ” Similar&nbsp;centres for study have been inaugurated in other countries,&nbsp;notably one in London in 1909. The diseases to which the&nbsp;application has been hitherto confined are papillomata, lupus&nbsp;vulgaris, epithelial tumours, syphilitic ulcers, pigmentary naevi,&nbsp;angiomata, and pruritus and chronic itching of the skin; but&nbsp;the use of radium in therapeutics is still experimental. The&nbsp;different varieties of rays used are controlled by the intervention of screens or filtering substances, such as silver, lead&nbsp;or aluminium. Radium is analgesic and bactericidal in its action.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RADIUS, properly a straight rod, bar or staff, the original meaning of the Latin word, to which also many of the various&nbsp;meanings seen in English were attached; it was thus applied&nbsp;to the spokes of a wheel, to the semi-diameter of a circle or&nbsp;sphere and to a ray or beam of light, “ ray ” itself coming&nbsp;through the Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raie</span><span class="font1"> from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">radius.</span><span class="font1"> From this last sense comes&nbsp;“ radiant, ” “ radiation, ” and allied words. In mathematics, a&nbsp;radius is a straight line drawn from the centre to the circumference of a circle or to the surface of a sphere; in anatomy&nbsp;the name is applied to the outer one of the two bones of the&nbsp;fore-arm in man or to the corresponding bone in the fore-leg of&nbsp;animals. It is also used in various other anatomical senses in&nbsp;botany, ichthyology, entomology, &amp;c. A further application of&nbsp;the term is to an area the extent of which is marked by the&nbsp;length of the radius from the point which is taken as the centre;&nbsp;thus, in London, for the purpose of reckoning the fare of hackney-carriages, the radius is taken as extending four miles in any&nbsp;direction from Charing Cross.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADNOR, EARLS OF. The 1st earl of Radnor was John Robartes (1606-1685), who succeeded his father, Richard&nbsp;Robartes, as 2nd baron Robartes of Truro in May 1634, the&nbsp;barony having been purchased under compulsion for £10, 000 in&nbsp;1625. The family had amassed great wealth by trading in tin&nbsp;and wool. Educated at Exeter College, Oxford, John Robartes&nbsp;fought on the side of the Parliament during the Civil War,&nbsp;being present at the battle of Edgehill and at the first battle&nbsp;of Newbury, and was a member of the committee of both&nbsp;kingdoms. He is said to have persuaded the earl of Essex&nbsp;to make his ill-fated march into Cornwall in 1644; he escaped&nbsp;with the earl from Lostwithiel and was afterwards governor&nbsp;of Plymouth. Between the execution of Charles I. and the&nbsp;restoration of Charles II. he took practically no part in public&nbsp;life, but after 1660 he became a prominent public man, owing&nbsp;his prominence partly to his influence among the Presbyterians,&nbsp;and ranged himself among Clarendon’s enemies. He was lord&nbsp;deputy of Ireland in 1660<sup>-</sup>1661 and was lord lieutenant in 1669-1670; from 1661 to 1673 he was lord privy seal, and from 1679 to&nbsp;1684 lord president of the council. In 1679 he was created vis-count Bodmin and earl of Radnor, and he died at Chelsea on&nbsp;the 17th of July 1685. His eldest son, Robert, viscount Bodmin,&nbsp;who was British envoy to Denmark, having predeceased his&nbsp;father, the latter was succeeded as 2nd earl by his grandson,&nbsp;Charles Bodvile Robartes (1660-1723), who was a member of&nbsp;parliament under Charles II. and James II., and was lord&nbsp;lieutenant of Cornwall from 1696 to 1705 and again from 1714&nbsp;to 1723. Henry, the 3rd earl (c. 1690-1741), was also a grand-son of the 1st earl, and John, the 4th earl (c. 1686-1757), was&nbsp;another grandson. When John, whose father was Francis&nbsp;Robartes (c. 1650<sup>-</sup>1718), a member of parliament for over&nbsp;thirty years and a musician of some repute, died unmarried in&nbsp;July 1757, his titles became extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Lanhydrock, near Bodmin, and the other estates of the Robartes family passed to the earl’s nephews, Thomas and&nbsp;George Hunt. Thomas Hunt’s grandson and heir, Thomas&nbsp;James Agar-Robartes (1808-1882), a grandson of an Irish peer,&nbsp;James Agar, 1st viscount Clifden (1734-1789), was created baron&nbsp;Robartes of Lanhydrock and of Truro in 1869, after having&nbsp;represented East Cornwall in seven parliaments. His son and&nbsp;successor, Thomas Charles Agar-Robartes, the 2nd baron&nbsp;(b. 1844), succeeded his kinsman as 6th viscount Clifden in&nbsp;1899.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1763 William Bouverie, 2nd viscount Folkestone (1725-1776), son of Sir Jacob Bouverie, bart. (d. 1761), of Longford, Wiltshire, who was created viscount Folkestone in 1747, was&nbsp;made earl of Radnor. Descended from a Huguenot family,&nbsp;William Bouverie was a member of parliament from 1747 until&nbsp;he succeeded to the peerage in February 1761. He died on&nbsp;the 28th of January 1776. His son and successor, Jacob,&nbsp;the 2nd earl (1750-1828), who took the name of Pleydell-Bouverie in accordance with the will of his maternal grand-father, Sir Mark Stuart Pleydell, bart. (d. 1768), was the father&nbsp;of William Pleydell-Bouverie, the 3rd earl (1779-1869), a&nbsp;politician of some note. In 1900 his great-grandson, Jacob&nbsp;Pleydell-Bouverie (b. 1868), became 6th earl of Radnor.</span></p>
