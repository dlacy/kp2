<p><span class="font1">draws the hind ends of thc rings together and so diminishes the calibre of the tube. Inside these is plentiful submücous tissue</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">containing mucous glands and quantities of lymphoid tissue, while the whole is lined internally by columnar ciliated epithelium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bronchi</span><span class="font1"> (see fig. 5) are the two tubes into which the trachea divides, but, since the branches, which these tubes&nbsp;give off later, are also called bronchi, it may be clearer to speak&nbsp;of primary, secondary and tertiary bronchi. Each primary&nbsp;bronchus runs downward and outward, but the right one is&nbsp;more in a line with the direction of the trachea than the left.&nbsp;The right primary bronchus has also a greater calibre than the&nbsp;left because the right lung is the larger, and for these two reasons&nbsp;when a foreign body enters the trachea it usually enters the&nbsp;right bronchus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first secondary bronchus comes off about an inch from the bifurcation of the trachea on the right side and, as it lies&nbsp;above the level of the pulmonary artery, it is known as the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">eparterial bronchus.</span><span class="font1"> On the left side the first branch is about&nbsp;two inches from the bifurcation and, like all the remaining&nbsp;secondary bronchi, is hyparterial: the left primary bronchus&nbsp;is therefore twice as long as the right. After the eparterial&nbsp;secondary bronchus is given off the direction of the right primary&nbsp;bronchus is carried on by the hyparterial secondary bronchus,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">and this, just before reaching tbe hilum of the lung, divides into upper and lower tertiary bronchi, while the left lower&nbsp;secondary hyparterial bronchus does not divide before reaching&nbsp;the hilum of its lung. Into the hilum or root of the right lung,&nbsp;therefore, three bronchial tubes enter, while on the left side&nbsp;there are only two. The firmly rooted habit of associating tbe&nbsp;term bronchi with those parts of the main tubes which lie between&nbsp;the bifurcation of the trachea and the point where the first&nbsp;branch comes off makes it very difficult to suggest a nomenclature which calls up any picture of the actual state of things&nbsp;to the mind. Certainly the classification into primary, secondary&nbsp;and tertiary bronchi only goes a very little way toward this,&nbsp;and it should be realized that, call them what we may, there&nbsp;are two long tapering tubes which run from the bifurcation of&nbsp;the trachea to the lower and back part of each lung, and give&nbsp;off a series of large ventral and small dorsal branches. The&nbsp;upper part of each of these long tubes or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stem bronchi</span><span class="font1"> is outside&nbsp;the lung and in the middle mediastinum of the thorax, the&nbsp;lower part embedded in the substance of the lung. The structure&nbsp;of the bronchi is practically identical with that of the trachea.&nbsp;(See G. S. Huntington’s “ Eparterial Bronchial System of the&nbsp;Mammalia,” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Am. Journ. Med. Sci.</span><span class="font1"> (Phila. 1898). See alsa&nbsp;Quain’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anatomy,</span><span class="font1"> London, last edition.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lungs</span><span class="font1"> are two pyramidal, spongy, slate-coloured, very vascular organs in which the blood is oxygenated. Each lies&nbsp;in its own side of the thorax and is surrounded by its own pleural&nbsp;cavity (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Coelom</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Serous Membranes),</span><span class="font1"> and has an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">apex&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which projects into the side of the root of the neck, a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">base</span><span class="font1"> which&nbsp;is hollowed for thc convexity of the diaphragm, an outer surface&nbsp;which is convex and lies against the ribs, an inner surface&nbsp;concave for the heart, pericardium and great vessels, a sharp&nbsp;anterior border which overlaps the pericardium and a broad,&nbsp;rounded posterior border which lies at the side of the spinal&nbsp;column. Each lung is nearly divided into two by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primary&nbsp;fissure</span><span class="font1"> which runs obliquely downward and forward, while the&nbsp;right lung has a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">secondary fissure</span><span class="font1"> Avhich runs horizontally&nbsp;forward from near the middle of the primary fissure. Tbe left&nbsp;lung has therefore an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">upper</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lower or basal lobe,</span><span class="font1"> while the&nbsp;right has </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">upper, middle</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lower lobes.</span><span class="font1"> On the inner surface&nbsp;of each lung is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">root</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jtilum</span><span class="font1"> at which alone its vessels,&nbsp;nerves and ducts (bronchi) can enter and leave it. Tbe structures-contained in the root of each lung are the branches and tributaries of (1) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pulmonary artery,</span><span class="font1"> (2) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pulmonary veins,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(3) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bronchi,</span><span class="font1"> (4) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bronchial arteries,</span><span class="font1"> (5) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bronchial veins,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(6) the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bronchial lymphatic vessels and glands,</span><span class="font1"> (7), the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pulmonary&nbsp;plexuses of nerves.</span><span class="font1"> Of these tbe first three are the largest and,&nbsp;in dividing the root from in front, the veins are first cut, then&nbsp;the arteries and last the bronchi. As has been pointed out&nbsp;already, the eparterial bronchus on the right side is above&nbsp;the level of the artery, but all the others (hyparterial) are on a&nbsp;lower level.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bronchial arteries</span><span class="font1"> supply the substance of the lung;, there are usually two on each side, and they lie behind the&nbsp;bronchi. The blood which they carry is chiefly returned by&nbsp;the pulmonary veins bringing oxidized blood back to tbe heart,&nbsp;so that here there is a normal and harmless mixture of arterial&nbsp;and venous blood. If there are any </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bronchial veins</span><span class="font1"> (their&nbsp;presence is doubted by some, and the writer has himself carefully&nbsp;but unsuccessfully searched for them several times), they open&nbsp;into the azygos veins of their own side. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bronchial lymphatic&nbsp;vessels</span><span class="font1"> lie behind the pulmonary vessels and open into several&nbsp;large glands which are black from straining off tbe carbon left&nbsp;in the lungs from the atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">anterior</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">posterior pulmonary plexus of nerves </span><span class="font1">on each side, the fibres of which are derived from tbe vagus and&nbsp;the upper thoracic ganglia of tbe sympathetic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Structure of the Lungs.—</span><span class="font1">As the bronchi become smaller and smaller by repeated division, the cartilage completely surrounds&nbsp;them and tends to form irregular plates instead of rings—they&nbsp;are therefore cylindrical,but when the terminal branches </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(lobular&nbsp;bronchi)</span><span class="font1"> are reached, the cartilage disappears and hemispherical&nbsp;bulgings called alveoli occur (fig. 6 A).
