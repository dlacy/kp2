            <p>In order to leſſen the enormous expence of masts, a propoſal was made ſome years ago
                to conſtruct them hollow; and the author having premiſed ſeveral experiments which
                he had made, proceeds as follows:@@</p>
            <p>“ Galileo taught us, that the reſiſtance or ſtrength of a hollow cylinder is to that
                of a full cylinder, containing the ſame quantity of matter, as the total diameter of
                the hollow one is to the diameter of the full one; and theſe experiments ſhow us,
                that the ſtrength or reſiſtance of two or more pieces of wood, faſtened together at
                each end, and connected by a pillar, pillars, or framing, increaſes, at leaſt to a
                certain degreee, caeteris paribus, as the diſtance between them and number of
                pillars, provided the force is applied in the line or direction of the pillars.</p>
            <p>“ It is ſurprising that this diſcovery of Galileo has not been made ſubſervient to
                more uſeful purpoſes. It is particularly applicable to the construction of maſts, as
                not requiring that the hollow cylinder ſhould be made of one solid piece of wood
                @@(g).</p>
            <p>“ However, the foregoing experiments teach us, that the ſame advantages may be
                obtained by other forms beſides that of a cylinder ; and that perhaps not only in a
                ſuperior degree, but likewiſe with greater facility of execution ; as by adopting a
                ſquare figure, but more particularly by eonſtructing them of ſeparate pieces of
                wood, placed at proper diſtances from each other, in the following or any other
                manner that may be found moſt convenient. Fig. 44, 45, and 46, exhibit each the
                tranſverſe ſection of a maſt, in which the ſmall circles repreſent the trees or
                upright pieces of wood, and</p>
            <p>the lines the beams or framing of wood, which are employed at proper places and at
                proper diſtances from each other, for connecting them together. Perhaps ſolid frames
                of wood, placed at proper diſtances from each other, and filling up the whole dotted
                ſpace, would anſwer better ; in which event, the maſt could be ſtrongly hooped with
                iron at thoſe places, and the upright trees formed ſquare, or of any other
                convenient form.</p>
            <p>“ It will be evident to thoſe acquainted with this ſubject, that ſuch maſts would be
                greatly ſtronger than common ones containing the ſame quantity of materials. It is
                likewiſe evident that they would be leſs apt to ſpring, as being ſupported on a more
                extended baſe, and affording many conveniences for being better ſecured ; and that
                they might be conſtructed of ſuch wood as at preſent would be deemed altogether
                improper for maſts : a circumſtance of importance to Britain at all times, but more
                particularly now, when there is ſuch difficulty in procuring wood proper for the
                kind of maſts in common uſe.”</p>
            <p>An improvement in the rudder has lately taken place in ſeveral ſhips, particularly in
                ſome of thoſe in the ſervice of the Eaſt India company. It will, however, be
                neceſſary previouſly to deſcribe the uſual form of the rudder, in order to ſhow the
                advantages it poſſeſſes when conſtructed agreeable to the improved method.</p>
            <p>N⁰ I. (fig. 47) repreſents the rudder according to the common method of conſtruction
                ; in which AB is the axis of rotation. It is hence evident that a ſpace conſiderably
                greater than the tranſverſe ſection of the rudder at the counter muſt be left in the
                counter for the rudder to revolve in. Thus, let CAB (n⁰ 3.) be the ſection of the
                rudder at the counter ; then there muſt be a ſpace ſimilar to CDE in the counter, in
                order that the rudder may be moveable as required. Hence, to prevent the water from
                waſhing up the rudder caſe, a rudder coat, that is, a piece of tarred canvas, is
                nailed in ſuch a manner to the rudder and counter as to cover the intermediate ſpace
                : but the canvas being continually waſhed by the ſea, ſoon becomes brittle, and
                unable to yield to the various turns of the rudder without breaking ; in which caſe
                the ſhip is of courſe left pervious to the waves, even of three or four feet high ;
                in fact, there are few men bred to the ſea who have not been witneſſes to the bad
                effects of ſuch a ſpace being left ſo ill guarded againſt the ſtroke of the waves ;
                and many ſhips have, with great probability, been ſuppoſed to founder at ſea from
                the quantity of water ſhipped between the rudder and counter.</p>
            <p>It was to remedy this defect that the alteration above alluded to took place ; which
                conſiſts in making the upper part AEG (fig. 48, n⁰ 1.) of the rudder ABD
                cylindrical, and giving that part at the ſame time a caſt forward, ſo that the axis
                of rotation may by that means be the line AD, palling as uſual from E to E), through
                the centres of the braces which attach the rudder to the ſtern-poſt, and from E to A
                through the</p>

            <p>@@@(g) The ſtrength of theſe cylinders would be ſtill further augmented by having
                ſolid pieces of wood placed within them at proper diſtances, and ſecurely faſtened
                to them, in the ſame manner, and on the ſame principles, that nature has furniſhed
                reeds with joints ; and for anſwering, in ſome reſpects, the same purpoſe as the
                pillars in the experiments alluded to.</p>
