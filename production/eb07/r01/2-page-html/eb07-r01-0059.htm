<p><span class="font0">RAIN, the descent of water from the atmosphere in the form of drops of considerable size. By this circumstance&nbsp;it is distinguished from dew and from fog. In the former the drops are so small that they are quite invisible ;&nbsp;in the latter, although their size be larger, they seem to&nbsp;have very little more specific gravity than the atmosphere&nbsp;itself, and may therefore be reckoned hollow spherules rather than drops. This subject will be found fully discussed&nbsp;in the articles on Meteobology, Physical Geography,&nbsp;and Weather.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Preternatural Rains.</span><span class="font0"> We have numerous accounts, in the historians of our own as well as other countries, of preternatural rains ; such as the raining of stones, of dust, of&nbsp;blood, nay, even of living animals, as young frogs, and the&nbsp;like. We cannot doubt the truth of what authors of veracity&nbsp;and credit relate to us of this sort, nor can we suppose that&nbsp;the falling of stones and dust never happened ; the whole&nbsp;mistake consists in supposing them to have fallen from the&nbsp;clouds. But as to the blood and frogs, it is very certain&nbsp;that they never fell at all, and the opinion to the contrary&nbsp;has been produced by a mere deception of sight. Men are&nbsp;extremely fond of the marvellous in their relations ; but the&nbsp;judicious reader must examine strictly whatever is reported&nbsp;of this kind, and not sufi<sup>-</sup>er himself to be deceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are two natural methods by which quantities of stones and of dust may fall in certain places, without their&nbsp;having been generated in the clouds or descended as rain.&nbsp;The one is by means of hurricanes ; the wind which we frequently see tearing off the tiles of houses, and carrying them&nbsp;to considerable distances, being equally capable of raising a&nbsp;quantity of stones, and dropping them again at some distant&nbsp;place. But the other, which is much the most powerful,&nbsp;and probably the most usual way, is by the eruptions of&nbsp;volcanoes and burning mountains tossing up, as they frequently do, a vast quantity of stones, ashes, and cinders, to&nbsp;an immense height in the air ; and these, being hurried&nbsp;away by the hurricanes and impetuous winds which usually&nbsp;accompany such eruptions, and being in themselves much&nbsp;lighter than common stones, from being half calcined, may&nbsp;thus be easily carried to vast distances, and there falling in&nbsp;places where the inhabitants know nothing of the occasion,&nbsp;cannot but be supposed by the vulgar to fall on them from&nbsp;the clouds. It is well known, that, in the great eruptions&nbsp;of Ætna and Vesuvius, showers of ashes, dust, and small&nbsp;cinders, have been seen to obscure the air, overspread the&nbsp;surface of the sea for a great way, and cover the decks of&nbsp;ships ; and this at such a distance, that it might appear&nbsp;scarcely conceivable they should have been carried so far :&nbsp;and probably, if the accounts of all the showers of these&nbsp;substances mentioned by authors were collected, they w ould&nbsp;all be ascertained to have fallen within such distances of&nbsp;volcanoes, whilst, if compared as to the time of their falling,&nbsp;they would be found to correspond in that also with the eruptions of those mountains. We have knowm instances of the&nbsp;ashes from Vesuvius having been carried thirty, nay, forty&nbsp;leagues ; and peculiar accidents may have carried them still&nbsp;farther. It is not to be supposed that these showers of&nbsp;stones and dust fall continuously in the manner of showers&nbsp;of rain, or that the fragments or pieces are as frequent as&nbsp;drops of water. It is sufficient that a number of stones, or&nbsp;a quantity of dust, fall at once on a place, where the inhabitants can have no knowledge of the point whence they&nbsp;came, and the vulgar will not doubt their dropping from the&nbsp;clouds. Nay, in the canton of Berne, in Switzerland, the&nbsp;inhabitants accounted it a miracle that it rained earth and&nbsp;sulphur upon them at a time when a small volcano terrified&nbsp;them ; and even whilst the wind was so boisterous, and hurricanes so frequent, that they saw almost every moment the&nbsp;dust, sand, and little stones torn up from the surface of the&nbsp;earth in whirlwinds, and carried to a considerable height in&nbsp;the air, they never considered that both the sulphur thrown&nbsp;up by the volcano, and the dust, sand, and stones carried&nbsp;from their feet, must soon afterwards fall somewhere. It is&nbsp;very certain that in some of the terrible storms of hail, where ,&nbsp;the hailstones have been several inches in circumference,&nbsp;there have been found, on breaking them, what people called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stones in their middle;</span><span class="font0"> but these observers need only to&nbsp;wait the dissolving of one of these hailstones, to see the&nbsp;stone in its centre also disunite, it being formed merely of the&nbsp;particles of loose earthy matter, which the water, exhaled&nbsp;by the sun’s heat, had taken up with it in extremely small&nbsp;molecules, and this serving to give an opaque hue to the&nbsp;inner part of the congelation, to which the freezing of the&nbsp;water alone gave the apparent hardness of stone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The raining of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">blood</span><span class="font0"> has ever been accounted a more terrible sight and a more fatal omen than the other preternatural rains already mentioned. It is very certain that nature forms blood nowhere but in the vessels of animals, and therefore showers of it from the clouds are by no means&nbsp;to be credited. Those who suppose that what people took&nbsp;for blood has actually been seen falling through the air,&nbsp;have had recourse for its origin to flying insects, and suppose it to be the eggs or dung of certain butterflies discharged as they were high up in the air. But this seems&nbsp;to be a very wild conjecture, as we know of no butterfly the&nbsp;excrements or eggs of which are of such a colour, or its&nbsp;abode so high in the air, or its flocks so numerous, as to be&nbsp;tile occasion of such a phenomenon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is most probable that these bloody waters were never seen falling ; but that people, seeing the standing waters&nbsp;blood-coloured, were assured, from their not knowing how&nbsp;it should else happen, that it had rained blood into them.&nbsp;A very’ memorable instance of this took place at the Hague&nbsp;in the year 1670. Swammerdam, who relates it, tells us,&nbsp;that one morning the whole town was in an uproar on finding, as they thought, their lakes and ditches full of blood ;&nbsp;for these having certainly been full of water the night before, they agreed that it must have rained blood during the&nbsp;night. But a certain physician went down to one of the&nbsp;canals, and taking home a quantity of this blood-coloured&nbsp;water, he examined it by the microscope, and found that&nbsp;the water was water still, and had not at all changed its&nbsp;colour ; but that it was full of prodigious swarms of small&nbsp;red animals, all alive, and very nimble in their motions, the&nbsp;colour and prodigious number of which gave a reddish tinge&nbsp;to the whole body of the water in which they lived. The certainty that this was the case, did not however persuade the&nbsp;Hollanders to part with the miracle. They prudently concluded, that the sudden appearance of such a number of&nbsp;animals was as great a prodigy as the raining of blood would&nbsp;have been ; and remain assured to this day, that this portent foretold the scene of war and destruction that Louis&nbsp;XIV. afterwards brought into that country, which had previously enjoyed forty years of uninterrupted peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The animals which thus colour the water of lakes and ponds are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pulices arborescentes</span><span class="font0"> of Swammerdam, or the&nbsp;water-fleas with branched horns. These creatures are of a&nbsp;reddish-yellow or flame colour. They live about the sides&nbsp;of ditches, under weeds, and amongst the mud ; and are&nbsp;therefore the less visible, except at a certain time, which is&nbsp;in the beginning or end of June. It is at this time that&nbsp;these little animals leave their recesses to float loose about&nbsp;the water, and meet for the propagation of their species;&nbsp;and by this means they become visible in the colour which&nbsp;they give the water. The colour in question is visible, more&nbsp;or less, in one part or other of almost all standing waters at&nbsp;this season ; and it is always at the same season that the&nbsp;bloody waters have alarmed the ignorant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The raining of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">frogs</span><span class="font0"> is a thing not less wonderful in the accounts of authors who love the marvellous than those of&nbsp;blood or stones ; and this is supposed to happen so frequently,&nbsp;that there are multitudes who pretend to have been eye-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
