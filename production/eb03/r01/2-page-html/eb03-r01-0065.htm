<p><span class="font1">The next thing conſidered by our author is the paſſage of the Iſraelites through the Red Sea. At the place where he ſuppoſes the paffage to have been, the&nbsp;ſea is not quite four leagues broad, ſo that it might ea-fily have been croſſed in one night without any miracle.&nbsp;There is about 14 fathom water in the channel, and 9&nbsp;at the ſides, with good anchorage everywhere ; the far-theſt ſide is a low fandy coaſt, and a very eaſy landing&nbsp;place. &quot; The draught of the bottom of the gulph&nbsp;(fays he) given by Dr Pococke, is very erroneous in&nbsp;every part of it. It was propoſed to Mr Niebuhr, when&nbsp;in Egypt, to inquire upon the fpot, whether there were&nbsp;not fome ridges of rocks where the water was ſhallow,&nbsp;fo that an army at particular times might paſs over ?&nbsp;Secondly, whether the Eteſian winds, which blow&nbsp;ſtrongly all ſummer from the north-weſt, could not&nbsp;blow ſo violently againſt the fea, as to keep it back on&nbsp;a heap, ſo that the Iſraelites might have paſſed with-⅛&gt;ut a miracle ? And a copy of theſe queries was left&nbsp;for me to join my inquiries likewiſe. But I muſt con-feſs, however learned the gentlemen were who propoſed&nbsp;theſe doubts, I did not think they merited any attention to ſolve them. If the Eteſian winds, blowing from&nbsp;the north-weſt in ſummer, could heap up the fea as a&nbsp;wall on the right or to the ſouth, of 50 feet high,&nbsp;ſtill the difficulty would remain of building the wall on&nbsp;the left hand or to the north. Beſides, water ſtanding&nbsp;in that poſition for a day, muſt have loſt the nature of&nbsp;a fluid, whence came that coheſion of particles that&nbsp;hindered that wall to efcape at the ſides ? This is as&nbsp;great a miracle as that of Moſes. If the Eteſian winds&nbsp;had done this once, they muſt have repeated it many a&nbsp;time before and ſince, from the ſame caufes. Yet Dio-dorus Siculus ſays, the Troglodytes, the indigenous inhabitants of that very ſpot, had a tradition from father&nbsp;to ſon, from their very earlieſt and remoteſt ages, that&nbsp;once this diviſion of the ſea did happen there ; and that,&nbsp;after leaving the bottom ſome time dry, the ſea again&nbsp;came back and covered it with great fury. I he words&nbsp;of this author are of the moſt remarkable kind, we&nbsp;cannot think this heathen is writing in favour of reve-lation. He knew not Mofes, nor ſays a word about&nbsp;Pharaoh and his hoſt ; but records the miracle of the&nbsp;diviſion of the ſea in words nearly as ſtrong as thoſe&nbsp;of Moſes, from the mouths of unbiaſſed undeſigning&nbsp;pagans.”</span></p>

But the&nbsp;fault of ſuch fortification is, that the befiegers from one&nbsp;battery may ruin both the ſides of the tenaille or front&nbsp;of a place, and make an aſſault without fear of being&nbsp;enfiladed, ſince the defences are mined. The parapet&nbsp;of the corridor is likewiſe often redented or carried oa&nbsp;by the way of redens. The redens was ufed before&nbsp;baſtions were invented, and fome people think them preferable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RED I (Francis), an Italian phyſician and polite ſcholar, was born at Arezzo in Tuſcany in 1626. Hie&nbsp;ingenuity and learning recommended him to the office&nbsp;of firſt phyſician to Ferdinand II. duke of Tuſcany ;&nbsp;and he contributed not a little toward the compiling of&nbsp;the Dictionary of La Crufca. He wrote upon vipers,&nbsp;upon the generation of infects, and compoſed a good&nbsp;deal of poetry. All his writings are in Italian ; and&nbsp;his language is fo fine and pure, that the authors of the&nbsp;Dictionary of La Crufca have often cited them as ſtan-dards of perfection. He died in 1697.</span></p>
