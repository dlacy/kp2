<p><span class="font0">Table IV. shews the effect of cheaper blocks on the total cost at each length of bearing ; it begins at 7s. per block,&nbsp;and increases 5¼d.or <sub>5</sub>⅛th, for each 3 inch es </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">increase in the&nbsp;length of the rail. The price of rails will never materially&nbsp;differ in any part of England, the freight being the principal variable quantity, but the price of blocks will alter in a&nbsp;very great degree, and the effect of this may be shewn ;&nbsp;take, for example, 2s. 8d. as the price of one for a two-feet&nbsp;bearing, and we know they have been procured cheaper ;&nbsp;adding to this, as we have done before, 2s. for the other&nbsp;items connected with the block, we get 4s. 8d. as the price&nbsp;of a block complete, and the price of the rail being 3s. 4d.,&nbsp;the total price is 8s. per rail, or l2s. per yard. In the same&nbsp;way we have l2s. 6d. per yard at 2¼-feet bearings ; 13s. ld.&nbsp;at 2½ feet; 13s. 7d. at 2¾ feet; l4s. 2d. at 3 feet; and&nbsp;18s. lld. at 5 feet ; hence in a railway 31 miles long, we&nbsp;shall find the saving, by having the blocks at two feet apart,&nbsp;L.75,293, viz.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">31 miles at 5 feet,..............L.206,237</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">„ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;„&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 feet,................130,944</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">L.75,293</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And as an useful approximation to this calculation, we may take each farthing per yard increase of cost in the total&nbsp;price per yard of single rail, to give L.7∙3333 per mile of&nbsp;double line, or in the above instance, there being 332 farthings between 12s. and 18s. lld., we have 7∙3333 × 332&nbsp;× 3l = L.75,474.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As we are obliged to place our supports close together, to get a minimum cost when the blocks are less in price&nbsp;than the cost we first assumed, so we shall find that when&nbsp;greater, we must increase their distance. For instance, if a&nbsp;block for a two-feet bearing costs 9s., the cost per yard of&nbsp;block and rail complete will be l8s. 6d. ; at 2¼ feet, 18s.4½d.&nbsp;and at 2½ feet, 18s. 4¾d., the minimum being between 2¼&nbsp;and 2½ feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have next to see what will be the effect when the rail and block are both either greater or less than in Table&nbsp;I. This divides itself into three branches ; first, when they&nbsp;decrease or increase in an equal ratio ; secondly, when the&nbsp;rail decreases or increases in a greater ratio than the block ;&nbsp;and, thirdly, when the block decreases and increases in a&nbsp;greater ratio than the rail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the first case, the ratio of the price per yard will remain evidently the same as in Table I. Thus, if both rail and block are reduced in price ⅙th, we shall have at 2 feet, the&nbsp;price per yard, l4s. l∙875d.; at 2¼ feet, 14s. l∙66d. per yard ;&nbsp;and at 2½ feet, 14s. 2∙4d. ; hence the minimum is as before&nbsp;at about 2 feet 2 inches, and the same will hold under any&nbsp;other increase or decrease, the ratio in rail and block being&nbsp;equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the second case, when the rail decreases in price in a greater ratio than the block, Table V. shews the corresponding effect, and the minimum will be found again at&nbsp;about 2 feet 2 inches, for at that distance we have 44 lbs.&nbsp;for the weight of the rail per yard, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">32∙S67</span><span class="font0"> lbs. for the&nbsp;weight per rail, which at l¼d. per lb. is 40∙334d. ; for the&nbsp;block, if <sup>,</sup>25 of a foot, increases the price 5¼d., then ∙2 of a&nbsp;foot will increase it 4∙2d., which added to 84d., the price at&nbsp;2 feet, gives 88∙2d. for 2∙2 feet. Hence the total price of rail&nbsp;and block is l0s. 8½d., or 14s. 7<sup>-</sup>27d. per yard, which is rather less than at 2¼ feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will be found, in like manner, that the effect of an increase of price in the same ratio will not affect the minimum ; for example, with an increase of ⅙th in the price of the rail,&nbsp;and ⅙th in the price of the block, we have at 2 feet the rail&nbsp;3s. 10∙666d., the block 9s. ; total, 12s. 10∙666d., or 19s. 4d.&nbsp;per yard. With 2¼ feet, the rail will be 59'065d., the block&nbsp;ll4∙75d. ; total, l4s. 5'815d., or per yard, 19s∙ 3¾d. With&nbsp;2½ feet the rail will be 72 9l5d., the block 121∙5d. ; total,&nbsp;l6s. 2½d., or per yard l9s. 5∙299d. ; and with 2∙2 feet, we&nbsp;have the rail 56∙466d., the block H3∙376d. ; total 14s.&nbsp;l∙842d., or per yard, 19s. 3∙6d., or rather less than at 2¼&nbsp;feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the case where the rail increases or decreases in a less ratio than the block, Table VI. shews the comparative&nbsp;effect on the minimum, which is here at about 2 feet, with&nbsp;a decrease in the prices; for trying 2∙2 feet, we get for the&nbsp;rail 40∙334d., the block 75∙6d. ; total, 115.934d., or per&nbsp;yard, 13s. 2∙09d. ; and at 2∙1 feet, we have for the rail&nbsp;36<sup>,</sup>75d., the block, 73∙8d. ; total, 1 l0∙55d., or per yard&nbsp;13s. l∙93d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When there is an increase of ⅙th in the price of the rail, and ¼th in the price of the block, we have for 2-feet bearings,&nbsp;the rail,46∙66d.,theblock, l20d.; total, l66∙66d.,or per yard,&nbsp;20s. 10d.; for 2¼ feet, we have, rail, 59'0625d., block, l27.5d.;&nbsp;total, l86∙5625d., or per yard 20s. 8.75d. ; for 2½ feet, the&nbsp;rail is 72∙915d., the block, l35d. ; total, 207<sup>,</sup>9l5d., or per&nbsp;yard, 20s. 9<sup>,</sup>498d. Hence the minimum is at 2¼ feet, for&nbsp;at 2∙3 feet the rail is 61∙7165d., the block 129d. ; total,&nbsp;!90∙7l68d., and the price per yard, 20s. 8∙76d. ; and at 2.2&nbsp;feet, the rail is 56∙4665d∙, the block, 126d.; total, 182∙4665d.,&nbsp;and the price per yard, 20s. 8∙8ld.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have now only left the cases where the price of the rail increases, while that of the block decreases ; the effect&nbsp;of this is shewn in Table VII. ; and when the price of the&nbsp;rail decreases, while that of the block increases, this is given&nbsp;in Table VIII. In Table VII. the minimum expense is at&nbsp;the distance of 2 feet, and in Table VIII. at 2¾ feet, this&nbsp;being the greatest distance yet obtained ; hence cheap rails&nbsp;and very dear blocks are the only conditions which will warrant a distance at all approaching to those now in use ; 2¾&nbsp;feet appearing to be the limits under any ordinary prices,&nbsp;and in general only 2¼, while in some instances 2 feet only&nbsp;should be taken, in order to lay down a railroad at the minimum expense, as far as the cost of the permanent way is&nbsp;concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Table VIII. we do not know on which side of 2½ feet the minimum expense will be ; we shall therefore, in order&nbsp;to complete the inquiry, investigate this as we have done in&nbsp;the other cases. Taking, then, 2∙6 feet, we get 52 lbs. per&nbsp;yard for the weight, or 45∙065 lbs. per rail, costing at l¼d.&nbsp;per lb. 56∙332d. ; for the block we have as ∙25 feet : 7d.&nbsp;=∙1 foot : 2∙8d., or 10s. 8∙8d. ; total, 185∙132d., or per&nbsp;yard, 17s. 9&quot;ld., being rather more than the price at 2∙5&nbsp;feet. Trying now 2∙4 feet, we have 48 lbs. per yard, or&nbsp;38∙4 lbs. per rail, costing 48d., and for the block 119d., the&nbsp;price at </span><span class="font2">2¼ </span><span class="font0">feet plus 4'2d., the proportion for ∙15 feet, or&nbsp;l23∙2d. ; total, 171∙2d., or per yard, 17s. 10d. which is&nbsp;more again than at 2∙5 feet ; the minimum price will therefore be very near 2∙5 feet, but rather more if any thing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It now remains for us to shew, why the particular rate of increase and decrease in the size of the rail and block, which&nbsp;we have given in the tables, has here been assumed.&nbsp;And, first, of the blocks. Every person, «’hen calculating&nbsp;this effect of prices for any particular railway, will of course&nbsp;take into consideration the cost of rails, blocks, and sleepers for the railway in question ; and as the rate of increase we have given, viz. one-fourth in the price of the&nbsp;block chair, and all appurtenances complete for each foot increase in the length of the rail, is more than whatis necessary&nbsp;rather than less, and as a decrease in the price of the blocks&nbsp;will lead to shortening the rails still more, it wall be seen&nbsp;that any error will be on the safe side. It will most probably be found in practice, that whatever the distance between the supports may be, the same absolute surface&nbsp;should be preserved in every case; for although it has been&nbsp;said that each block, be its distance what it may, has but&nbsp;to support a certain weight passing over it, yet this is not a&nbsp;correct mode of reasoning, because it has to support that&nbsp;weight for a longer time, when the distance between each</span></p>
