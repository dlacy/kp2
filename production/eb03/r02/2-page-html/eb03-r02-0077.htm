<p><span class="font0">cheap and certain conveyance of goods is there obtained by means of ſtreams which we would think no better&nbsp;than boundary ditches, and unfit for every purpoſe of&nbsp;this kind. By means of a bar the water is kept up a&nbsp;very few inches, and the ſtream has free courſe to the&nbsp;ſea. The ſhoot over the bar is prevented by means of&nbsp;another bar placed a little way below it, lying flat in&nbsp;the bottom of the ditch, but which may be raiſed up&nbsp;on hinges. The lighterman makes his boat faſt to a&nbsp;flake immediately above the bar, raiſes the lower bar,&nbsp;brings over his boat, again makes it ſaſt, and, having&nbsp;laid down the other bar again, proceeds on his journey.&nbsp;This contrivance anſwers the end of a lock at a very&nbsp;trifling expence ; and though it does not admit of what&nbsp;we are accuſtomed to call navigation, it gives a very&nbsp;ſure conveyance, which would otherwiſe be impoſſible.&nbsp;When the waters can be raiſed by bars, ſo that they&nbsp;may be drawn off for machinery or other purpoſes,&nbsp;they are preferable to weirs, becauſe they do not obſtruct floating with rafts, and are not deſtroyed by the&nbsp;ice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prob. III. Given the height of a bar, the depth of water both above and below it, and the width of the&nbsp;river, to determine the diſeharge ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This is by no means ſo eaſily ſolved as the diſcharge over a weir, and we cannot do it with the ſame degree&nbsp;of evidence. We imagine, however, that the following obſervations will not be very far from a true account of the matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We may firſt ſuppoſe a reſervoir LFBM (fig. 19.) of ſtagnant water, and that it has a waſteboard of the&nbsp;height CB. We may then determine, by the foregoing problems, the diſcharge through the plane E C.&nbsp;With reſpect to the diſcharge through the part C A, it&nbsp;ſhould be equal to this product of the part of the ſection by the velocity correſponding to the fall EC, which&nbsp;is the difference of the heights of water above and below the bar ; for, becauſe the difference of E </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;C </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> is equal to E C, every particle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> of water in the&nbsp;plane CA is preſſed in the direction of this ſtream with&nbsp;the ſame force, &lt;z√z. the weight of the column E C.&nbsp;The ſum of theſe diſcharges ſhould be the whole diſcharge over the bar ; but ſince the bar is ſet up acroſs&nbsp;a running river, its diſcharge muſt be the ſame with&nbsp;that of the river. The water of the river, when ſt&nbsp;comes to the place of the bar, has acquired ſome velocity by its ſlope or other cauſes, and this correſponds&nbsp;to ſome height F E. This velocity, multiplied by the&nbsp;ſection of the river, having the height E B, ſhould&nbsp;give a diſcharge equal to the diſeharge over the bar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To avoid this complication of conditions, we may firſt compute the diſcharge of the bar in the manner&nbsp;now pointed out, without the conſideration of the previous velocity of the ſtream. This diſcharge will be a&nbsp;little too ſmall. If we divide it by the ſection F B, it&nbsp;will give a primary velocity too ſmall, but not far from&nbsp;the truth. Therefore we ſhall get the height F E, by&nbsp;means of which we ſhall be able to determine a velocity intermediate between D G and C H, which would&nbsp;correſpond to a weir, as alſo the velocity C H, which&nbsp;correſponds to the part of the ſection C A, which is&nbsp;wholly under water. Then we correct all theſe quantities by repeating the operation with them inſtead of&nbsp;our firſt aſſumptions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Buat found this </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">computation extremely near the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">truth, but in all caſes a little greater than obſervation exhibited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We may now ſolve the problem in the moſt general terms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prob. IV. Given the breadth, depth, and the ſlope of a river, if we confine its paſſage by a bar or weir of&nbsp;a known height and width, to determine the riſe of the&nbsp;waters above the bar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſlope and dimenſions of the channel being given, our formula will give us the velocity and the quantity&nbsp;of water diſeharged. Then, by the preceding problem,&nbsp;find the height of water above the waſteboard. From&nbsp;the ſum of theſe two heights deduct the ordinary depth&nbsp;of the river. The remainder is the riſe of the waters.&nbsp;For example :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Let there be a river whoſe ordinary depth is 3 feet, arid breadth 40, and whoſe ſlope is ι∣ inches in 100 fathoms, or ∙j-g⅛o∙ Suppoſe a weir on this river 6 feet&nbsp;high and 1 8 feet wide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We muſt firſt find the velocity and diſcharge of the river in its natural ſtate, we have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font0"> =480 inches, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h =&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">36, — = 5-ffVσ∙ Our formula of uniform motion gives</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">V = 23,45, and D = 405216 cubic inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The contraction obtains here on the three ſides of the orifice. We may therefore take √Tg = 26,τ.—&nbsp;TV. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B.</span><span class="font0"> This example is*Mr Buat’s, and all the meaſures&nbsp;are French. We have alſo </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> (the height of the weir)&nbsp;72, and 2 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g =.</span><span class="font0"> 724. Therefore the equation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h =</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(ô.«7√⅛^∕) ÷~ (7√⅛ (α<sub>+</sub>i )* <sup>becomes</sup> 3°'<sup>l82</sup>∙</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Add this to the height of the weir, and the depth of the river above the ſluice is 102,182, = 8 feet and&nbsp;6,τ82 inches. From this take 3 ſeet, and there remai ,<sub>+&nbsp;</sub>5 feet and 6,182 inches for the riſe of the waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is, however, an important circumſtance in this riſe of the waters, which muſt be diſtinctly underſtood&nbsp;before we can ſay what are the intereſting effects of this&nbsp;weir. This ſwell extends, as we all know, to a conſiderable diſtance up the ſtream, but is leſs fenſible as we&nbsp;go away from the weir. What is the diſtance to which&nbsp;the ſwell extends, and what increaſe does it produce in&nbsp;the depth at different diſtances from the weir ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we ſuppoſe that the ſlope and the breadth of the channel remain as before, it is plain, that as we come&nbsp;down the ſtream from that point where the ſwell is inſenſible, the depth of the channel increaſes all the way&nbsp;to the dam. Therefore, as the ſame quantity of water paſſes through every ſection of the river, the velocity muſt diminiſh in the ſame proportion (very nearly)&nbsp;that the ſection increaſes. But this being an open&nbsp;ſtream, and therefore the velocity being iuſeparably connected with the ſlope of the ſurface, it follows, that&nbsp;the ſlope of the ſurface muſt diminiſh ail the way from&nbsp;that point where the ſwell of the water is inſenſible to&nbsp;the dam. The ſurface, therefore, cannot be a ſimple&nbsp;inclined plane, but muſt be concave upwards, as repreſented in ſig. 20. where FKLB repreſents the channel&nbsp;of a river, and FB the ſurface of the water running in it.&nbsp;If this be kept up to A by a weir AL, the ſurface&nbsp;will be a curve FIA, touching the natural ſurface F&nbsp;at the beginning of the ſwell, and the line AD which&nbsp;touches it in A will have the ſlope S correſponding to&nbsp;the velocity which the waters have immediately before&nbsp;going over the weir. We know this ſlope, becauſe we</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
