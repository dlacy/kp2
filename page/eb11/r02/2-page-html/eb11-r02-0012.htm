<p><span class="font1">March 1811, in Paris at the Tuileries palace. He was at first named the king of Rome, after the analogy of the heirs of the&nbsp;emperors of the Holy Roman Empire. By his birth the&nbsp;Napoleonic dynasty seemed to be finally established; but in&nbsp;three years it crumbled in the dust. At the time of the downfall&nbsp;of the empire (April 1814) Marie Louise and the king of Rome&nbsp;were at Blois with Joseph and Jerome Bonaparte, who wished&nbsp;to keep them as hostages. This design, however, was frustrated.&nbsp;Napoleon abdicated in favour of his son; but events prevented&nbsp;the reign of Napoleon II. from being more than titular. While&nbsp;Napoleon repaired to Elba, his consort and child went to&nbsp;Vienna; and they remained in Austria during the Hundred&nbsp;Days (1815), despite efforts made by the Bonapartists to carry&nbsp;off the prince to his father at Paris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Meanwhile the congress of Vienna had carried out the conditions of the treaty of Fontainebleau (March 1814) whereby the duchies of Parma and Guastalla were to go to the ex-Empress Marie Louise and her son, although much opposition&nbsp;was offered to this proposal by Louis XVIII. and even (so it&nbsp;now appears) by Metternich. The secret treaty of the 31st&nbsp;of May 1815 between Austria, Russia and Prussia secured&nbsp;those possessions to her, her son bearing the title Prince of&nbsp;Parma, with hereditary rights for his descendants. But after&nbsp;the second abdication of Napoleon in favour of his son (22nd&nbsp;of June 1815)—a condition which was wholly nugatory—the&nbsp;powers opposed all participation of the prince in the affairs&nbsp;of Parma. He therefore remained in Austria, while Marie&nbsp;Louise proceeded to Parma. From this time onward he became, as it were, a pawn in the complex game of European&nbsp;politics, his claims being put forward sometimes by Metternich,&nbsp;sometimes by the unionists of Italy, while occasionally malcontents in France used his name to discredit the French&nbsp;Bourbons. The efforts of malcontents increased the resolve&nbsp;of the sovereigns never to allow a son of Napoleon to bear&nbsp;rule; and in November 1816 the court of Vienna informed&nbsp;Marie Louise that her son could not succeed to the duchies.&nbsp;This decision was confirmed by the treaty of Paris of the roth&nbsp;of June 1817. Marie Louise demanded as a slight compensation that he should have a title derived from the lands of the&nbsp;“ Bavarian Palatinate ” in northern Bohemia, and the title&nbsp;of “ duke of Reichstadt ” was therefore conferred on him on&nbsp;the 22nd of July 1818. Thus Napoleon I., who once averred&nbsp;that he would prefer that his son should be strangled rather&nbsp;than brought up as an Austrian prince, lived to see his son&nbsp;reduced to a rank inferior to that of the Austrian archdukes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His education was confided chiefly to Count Dietrichstein, who found him precocious, volatile, passionate and fond of&nbsp;military affairs. The same judgment was given by Marshal&nbsp;Marmont, duke of Ragusa, who recognized the warlike strain&nbsp;in his character. His nature was sensitive, as appeared on his&nbsp;receiving the news of the death of his father in 1821. The&nbsp;upheaval in France in 1830 and the disturbances which ensued&nbsp;led many Frenchmen to turn their thoughts to Napoleon II.;&nbsp;but though Metternich dallied for a time with the French&nbsp;Bonapartists, he had no intention of inaugurating a Napoleonic&nbsp;revival. By this time, too, the duke’s health was on the decline;&nbsp;his impatience of all restraint and his indulgence in physical&nbsp;exercise far beyond his powers aggravated a natural weakness&nbsp;of the chest, and he died on the 22nd of July 1832.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REID, SIR GEORGE (1841- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), Scottish artist, was born</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in Aberdeen on the 31st of October 1841. He developed an early passion for drawing, which Ied to his being apprenticed&nbsp;in 1854 for seven years to Messrs Keith &amp; Gibb, lithographers&nbsp;in Aberdeen. In 1861 Reid took lessons from an itinerant&nbsp;portrait-painter, William Niddrie, who had been a pupil ol&nbsp;James Giles, R.S.A., and afterwards entered as a student in&nbsp;the school of the Board of Trustees in Edinburgh. He returned&nbsp;to Aberdeen to paint landscapes and portraits for any trifling&nbsp;sum which his work could command. His first portrait to&nbsp;attract attention, from its fine quality, was that of George&nbsp;Macdonald, the poet and novelist, now the property of the&nbsp;university of Aberdeen. His early landscapes were conscientiously painted in the open air and on the spot. But&nbsp;Reid soon came to see that such work was inherently false,&nbsp;painted as the picture was day after day under varying conditions of light and shade. Accordingly, in 1865 he proceeded&nbsp;to Utrecht to study under A. MoIlinger, whose work he admired, from its unity and simplicity. This change in his&nbsp;method of viewing Nature was looked on as revolutionary by&nbsp;the Royal Scottish Academy, and for some years his work&nbsp;found little favour in that quarter; but other artists gradually&nbsp;adopted the system of tone-studies, which ultimately prevailed. Reid went ,to Paris in 1868 to study under the figure&nbsp;painter Yvon; and he worked in 1872 with Josef Israels&nbsp;at the Hague. From this time forward Reid’s success was&nbsp;continuous and marked. He showed his versatility in landscape, as in his “ Whins in Bloom,” which combined great&nbsp;breadth with fine detail; in flower-pieces, such as his “ Roses,”&nbsp;which were brilliant in rapid suggestiveness and force; but&nbsp;most of all in his portraits, which are marked by great individuality, and by fine insight into character. His work in&nbsp;black-and-white, his admirable illustrations in brushwork of&nbsp;Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, and also his pen-drawings,&nbsp;about which it has been declared that “ his work contains&nbsp;all the. subtleties and refinements of a most delicate etching,”&nbsp;must also be noted. Elected Associate of the Royal Scottish&nbsp;Academy in 1870, Reid attained full membership in 1877,&nbsp;and took up his residence in Edinburgh in 1882. In 1891&nbsp;he was elected President—a post which he held until 1902—&nbsp;receiving also the honour of knighthood, and he was awarded&nbsp;a gold medal at the Paris Exhibition of 1900. His brother&nbsp;Samuel (b. 1854) was also a painter and a writer of tales and&nbsp;verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REID, ROBERT (1862- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), American artist, was bom at</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Stockbridge, Mass., on the 29th of JuIy 1862. He studied at the art schools of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the&nbsp;Art Students’ League, New York, and under Boulanger and&nbsp;Lefebvre in Paris. His early pictures were figures of French&nbsp;Iicasants, painted at Étaples, but subsequently he became best&nbsp;known for mural decoration and designs for stained glass.&nbsp;He contributed with others to the frescoes of the dome of&nbsp;the Liberal Arts Building at the Columbian Exposition, Chicago,&nbsp;in 1893. Other work is in the Congressional Library, Washington, the Appellate Court House, New York, and the State&nbsp;House, Boston, where are his three large panels, “ James&nbsp;Otis Delivering his Speech against the Writs of Assistance,”&nbsp;“ Paul Revere’s Ride ” and the “ Boston Tea Party.” He&nbsp;executed a panel for the American Pavilion at the Paris Exhibition, 1900, and in 1906 he completed a series of ten stained&nbsp;glass windows for a church at Fairhaven, Mass., for the Rogers&nbsp;Memorial. In 1906 he became a full member of the National&nbsp;Academy of Design.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REID, SIR ROBERT GILLESPIE (1840-1908), Canadian railway contractor, was born at Coupar-Angus, Scotland.&nbsp;When a young man he spent a few years in Australia goldmining, and in 1871 he settled in America, where he began his&nbsp;career as a contractor. He built one section of the Canadian&nbsp;Pacific railway, and was responsible for the erection of the&nbsp;international bridge over the Niagara river, the international&nbsp;railway bridge over the Rio Grande river and the Lachine&nbsp;bridge over the St Lawrence. In 1893 Reid signed a contract&nbsp;with the government of Newfoundland by which he undertook to construct a railway from St John’s to Port-aux-Basques&nbsp;and to work the line for ten years in return for a large grant&nbsp;of land. In 1898 he further contracted to work all the railways&nbsp;in Newfoundland for fifty years on condition that at the end</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
