<p><span class="font1">or in all probability ever will have, it in his power to exercise, in the way of parcelling out the globe amongst his adherents. Everything was quiet, every heretic had been ex-<sub>l</sub> terminated, and the whole Christian world supinely acqui-<sub>ι</sub> esced in the enormous absurdities which were inculcated upon them ; when, in 1517, a spirit of inquiry arose, and&nbsp;the empire of superstition began to decline. The person&nbsp;who made the first attack on the extravagant superstitions&nbsp;then prevalent was Martin Luther. By some it is pretended that the only motive which Luther had in beginning the&nbsp;Reformation was his enmity to the Dominicans, who had&nbsp;excluded his order, the Augustinians, from all share in the&nbsp;gainful traffic of indulgences. But this does not seem at all&nbsp;probable, for such a motive would not naturally lead him&nbsp;to deny the virtue of indulgences, whilst his conduct could&nbsp;not but exclude him for ever from any chance of a share in&nbsp;the traffic, which otherwise he might perhaps have obtained. Besides, this traffic was so contrary to the common&nbsp;principles of reason and honesty, that we cannot wonder at&nbsp;finding one man in the world who had sense enough to discern it, and virtue enough to oppose such a disgraceful practice. In all probability, however, the insignificance of the&nbsp;first reformer was the reason why he was not persecuted and&nbsp;exterminated at the very outset, as others had been before&nbsp;him. Another reason probably might be, that he did not&nbsp;at once attack the whole errors of Popery, but brought about&nbsp;his reformation gradually, probably as it occurred to himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Reformation commenced in the city of Wittenberg &quot;in Saxony, but was not long confined either to that city&nbsp;or to the province in which it is situated. In 1520 the Franciscan friars, who had the care of promulgating indulgences&nbsp;in Switzerland, were opposed by Zuinglius, a man not inferior in understanding and knowledge to Luther himself. He&nbsp;proceeded with the greatest vigour to overturn the whole&nbsp;fabric of Popery ; but his opinions were declared to be erroneous by the universities of Cologne and Louvain. Notwithstanding this, the magistrates of Zurich approved of his&nbsp;proceedings ; and the whole of that canton, together with&nbsp;those of Berne, Basil, and Schauffhausen, embraced his opi</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">nions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Germany, Luther continued to make great advances, without being in the least intimidated by the ecclesiastical&nbsp;censures which were thundered against him from all quarters. Continually protected by the German princes, either&nbsp;from religious or political motives, his adversaries could not&nbsp;accomplish his destruction as they had done that of others.&nbsp;Those princes who were upon bad terms with the court of&nbsp;Rome took advantage of the success of the new doctrines,&nbsp;and in their own dominions easily overturned a church which&nbsp;had lost all respect and veneration amongst the inferior&nbsp;ranks. The court of Rome had disobliged some of the smaller&nbsp;princes in the north of Germany, whom the pope probably&nbsp;thought too insignificant to be worth managing ; and they,&nbsp;in revenge, universally established the Reformation in their&nbsp;own dominions. Melancthon, Carlostadt, and other men&nbsp;of eminence, also greatly forwarded the work of Luther ;&nbsp;and in all probability the papal hierarchy would have soon&nbsp;come to an end, in the northern parts of Europe at least,&nbsp;had not the Emperor Charles V. given a severe check to the&nbsp;progress of the Reformation in Germany. In order to follow out the schemes dictated by his ambition, he thought&nbsp;it necessary to ingratiate himself with the pope ; and the&nbsp;most effectual method of doing this seemed to be by the&nbsp;destruction of Luther. The pope’s legates insisted that&nbsp;Luther ought to be condemned by the Diet of Worms, as&nbsp;a most notorious, avowed, and incorrigible heretic. This&nbsp;however appeared unjust to the members of the diet, and&nbsp;he was summoned to appear personally, which he accordingly did without hesitation. There is not the least doubt&nbsp;that his appearance there would have becn his last in this</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">world, if the astonishing respect that was paid him, and the crowds who came daily to see him, had not deterred his&nbsp;judges from employing summary means against the author&nbsp;of such a heresy. He was therefore permitted to depart&nbsp;with a safe-conduct for a certain time ; after which he </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">re</span><span class="font1">mained in the state of a proscribed or intercommuned criminal, to whom it was unlawful to perform any of the ordinary offices of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the confinement of Luther in a castle near Warburg, the Reformation advanced rapidly, almost every city in Saxony embracing the Lutheran opinions. At this time&nbsp;an alteration in the established forms bf worship was first&nbsp;adventured upon at Wittenberg, by abolishing the celebration of private masses, and giving the cup as well as the&nbsp;bread to the laity in the Lord’s Supper. In a short time,&nbsp;however, the new opinions were condemned by the university of Paris, and a refutation of them was attempted by&nbsp;Henry VIII. of England. But Luther was not to be thus&nbsp;intimidated. He published his animadversions on both with&nbsp;as much acrimony as if he had been refuting the meanest&nbsp;adversary ; and a controversy managed by such illustrious&nbsp;antagonists attracted general attention, the Reformers daily&nbsp;gaining new converts both in France and England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But whilst the efforts of Luther were thus everywhere crowned with success, the divisions began to prevail which&nbsp;have since so much agitated the reformed churches. The&nbsp;first dispute occurred between Luther and Zuinglius concerning the manner in which the body and blood of Christ&nbsp;were present in the Eucharist. Luther and his followers,&nbsp;although they had rejected the notion of transubstantiation,&nbsp;were nevertheless of opinion that the body and blood of&nbsp;Christ were really present in the Lord’s Supper, in a way&nbsp;which they could not pretend to explain. Carlostadt, who&nbsp;was Luther’s colleague, first suggested another view of the&nbsp;subject, which was afterwards confirmed and illustrated by&nbsp;Zuinglius, namely, that the body and blood of Christ were&nbsp;not really present in the Eucharist ; and that the bread and wine were no more than external symbols to excite the remembrance of Christ’s sufferings in the minds of those who&nbsp;received it. Both parties maintained their tenets with the&nbsp;utmost obstinacy, and, by their divisions, first gave their&nbsp;adversaries an argument against them, which to this day the&nbsp;Catholics urge with great force ; alleging that the Protestants are so divided that it is impossible to know who is&nbsp;right or who is wrong ; and arguing from these divisions,&nbsp;that the whole doctrine is false.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To these intestine divisions were added the horrors of a&lt; civil w<sup>,</sup>ar, occasioned by oppression on the one hand, and by&nbsp;enthusiasm on the other. In 1525, a great number of seditious fanatics arose on a sudden in different parts of Germany ; and having taken arms, they united their forces, and&nbsp;made war against the empire, laying waste the country with&nbsp;fire and sword, and committing everywhere the most barbarous cruelties. The greater part of this furious mob was&nbsp;composed of peasants and vassals, who groaned under heavy&nbsp;burdens, and declared that they were no longer able to bear&nbsp;the despotic government of their chiefs ; and hence this sedition received the name of the Rustic War, or the War of&nbsp;the Peasants. At first this rabble declared, that they had no&nbsp;other motives than the redress of their grievances ; but no&nbsp;sooner had the enthusiast Munster, the Anabaptist, placed&nbsp;himself at their head, than the face of things was entirely&nbsp;changed, and the civil commotions in Saxony and Thuringia rapidly increased. (See the article Anabap</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>,</sup>πsts.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time Frederick, surnamed the Wise, elector of Saxony, and Luther’s great patron, departed this life, and&nbsp;was succeeded by his brother John. Frederick, though he&nbsp;had protected and encouraged Luther, yet was at no pains&nbsp;to introduce the reformed religion into his dominions. But&nbsp;with his successor it proved otherwise ; for he, being convinced that Luther’s doctrine must soon be totally destroyed</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
