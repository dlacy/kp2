<p><span class="font0">doors that divided Paul’s apartments from those of the empress, she was disturbed, and began to call for help, when a voice whispered in her ear, commanding her to remain&nbsp;quiet, and threatening that if she uttered another word she&nbsp;should instantly be put to death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Paul was now making his last struggle, when one of the party struck him on the temple with his fist, and laid him&nbsp;prostrate on the floor. Recovering from the blow, the unhappy monarch again implored his life. At this moment&nbsp;the heart of one of the conspirators relented, and he was&nbsp;observed to hesitate and tremble, when a young Hanoverian who was present exclaimed, we have passed the Rubicon ; if we spare his life, we shall, before the setting of&nbsp;to-morrow’s sun, become his victims ; on saying which he&nbsp;took off his sash, turned it twice round the naked neck of&nbsp;the emperor, and giving one end to ZubofF, he himself drew&nbsp;the other, till the object of their attack expired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Emperor Alexander, Paul’s eldest son, was in his . twenty-fourth year when he ascended the throne, and from&nbsp;• his amiable disposition had acquired the love and respect&nbsp;of all his subjects. The first measure which he adopted,&nbsp;his proclamation, and his first imperial orders, all tended&nbsp;to encourage and confirm the confidence with which the&nbsp;people beheld him ascend the throne of his forefathers.&nbsp;He solemnly promised to tread in the steps of Catherine&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">U. ; </span><span class="font0">he allowed every one to dress according to his o¼m&nbsp;fancy; he exonerated the inhabitants of tile capital from&nbsp;the trouble and duty of alighting from their carriages on&nbsp;the approach of the imperial family ; he dismissed the court&nbsp;advocate, who was universally and justly detested ; he suppressed the secret inquisition, that had become the scourge&nbsp;of the country ; he restored to the senate its former authority, set at liberty the state prisoners, and recalled from Siberia several of the exiles. He even extended his mercy&nbsp;to the assassins of the late emperor. Zuboff was ordered&nbsp;not to approach the imperial residence, and the governor&nbsp;of the city was transferred to Riga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is not easy to explain the motives that induced Alexander to forego that vengeance which justice seemed to demand on the heads of his father’s assassins. It has been&nbsp;attributed by one of his panegyrists to a fiarlom and melancholy conviction that the murderers had been prompted&nbsp;to commit the bloody deed solely by a regard for the salvation of the empire. This conviction might have induced&nbsp;the young monarch to diminish the weight of the punishment which piety and justice called on him to inflict, but&nbsp;can scarcely account for his total forbearance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alexander, on his accession to the throne, appeared desirous to cultivate the friendship of the neighbouring states, - and especially that of Great Britain. His late father, among&nbsp;<sup>9</sup>other projects, had procured himself to be elected grandmaster of the knights of Malta, and had laid claim to the&nbsp;sovereignty of that island. This claim, which had nearly produced a rupture between the courts of London and St Petersburg, Alexander consented to abandon, though he expressed&nbsp;a wish to be elected grand-master of the order, by the free&nbsp;suffrages of the knights. A confederacy, as we have seen, had&nbsp;been formed among the northern powers of Europe, with a&nbsp;view to oppose the British claim to the sovereignty of the&nbsp;seas ; but by the spirited interference of the British court,&nbsp;especially with the cabinet of St Petersburg, the good understanding between Britain and the northern states was reestablished, and the embargo which had been laid on British&nbsp;vessels in the Russian ports was taken off. Alexander, however, earnestly desired to maintain peaceful relations with&nbsp;France; and expressed this wish, both in public manifestos,&nbsp;and in private communications addressed to the First Consul.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Early in the same year there was signed at St Petersburg a treaty of amity, commerce, and navigation, between Russia and Sweden, to continue for twelve years, by which Sweden was allowed to import into Russia, alum,&nbsp;salt herrings, and salt, on the payment of one half of the&nbsp;duties then exacted, and into Russian Finland the produce&nbsp;of Swedish Finland duty free ; while the importation of&nbsp;Russia into Sweden, of hemp, linen, and tallow, was allowed at one half of the existing duties, and of linseed at&nbsp;two thirds. The most remarkable part of this treaty was&nbsp;the recognition, by the court of St Petersburg, of the&nbsp;northern confederacy, which the amicable adjustment with&nbsp;Britain appeared to have done away. The commerce of&nbsp;Russia had now recovered its former splendour. The exports from the city of Riga alone, for the year ending July&nbsp;1801, amounted to 6,770,638 roubles, and of these exports&nbsp;England alone imported to the value of 2,509,853 roubles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the 25th of March 1802 was signed at Amiens the definitive treaty of peace between the belligerent powers of&nbsp;Europe, by one material article of which the islands of Malta,&nbsp;Gozo, and Comino, were to be restored to the knights of&nbsp;St John of Jerusalem, under the protection and guarantee&nbsp;of France, Great Britain, Austria, Spain, Russia, and Prussia ; and his Sicilian majesty was invited to furnish two thousand men, natives of his states, to serve in garrisons at the&nbsp;different fortresses of the said islands, for one year after their&nbsp;restitution to the knights, or until they should be replaced&nbsp;by a force deemed sufficient by the guaranteeing powers.&nbsp;Some time after the conclusion of this treaty, disputes arose&nbsp;among the contracting powers relative to the sovereignty&nbsp;of Malta, which the emperor of Russia insisted should be&nbsp;yielded to Naples, otherwise he would not undertake to&nbsp;guarantee the order, and would separate from it the priories of Russia. The result of these disputes is well known,&nbsp;as they afforded a reason for renewing the bloody contest&nbsp;which so long desolated Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the short interval of peace, the emperor of Russia made several prudent regulations in the internal administration of his empire. On the 12th of September 1801, a manifesto had been published, proclaiming the union of&nbsp;Georgia, or Russian Grusinia, with the empire ; and on the&nbsp;1st of April 1802, Alexander sent a deputation to establish&nbsp;the new governmental Teflis, the capital of the province.&nbsp;On the 28th of May the emperor wrote a letter to the chamberlain Wittostoff, president of the commission for ameliorating the condition of the poor of St Petersburg, in which he&nbsp;recommended to the commission to follow the example of a&nbsp;similar establishment at Hamburg, in selecting proper objects&nbsp;for their charitable bequests, preferring the humble and industrious pauper to the idle and sturdy beggar. He also offered considerable premiums to persons who should introduce&nbsp;any new or advantageous mode of agriculture, or who should&nbsp;bring to perfection any old invention, open any new branch&nbsp;of commerce, establish any new manufacture, or contrive&nbsp;any machine or process that might be useful in the arts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Early in the year 1803, the emperor fitted out, at his own expense, two vessels for a voyage of discovery round the&nbsp;world, under the command of Captain Krusenstern. These&nbsp;ships were provided with every necessary for accomplishing&nbsp;the object of the voyage ; and several men of eminence for&nbsp;science and literature, among whom was Churchman the&nbsp;American astronomer, volunteered their services on this&nbsp;occasion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the beginning of 1804 the emperor established a university at Kharkof, in Lithuania, for the cultivation and diffusion of the arts and sciences in that part of the Russian empire ; and Mr Fletcher Campbell, a Scotch gentleman,&nbsp;was employed to procure masters for this new institution.&nbsp;Some time after, the emperor ordered that meteorological&nbsp;observations should be regularly made at all the universities&nbsp;and public schools, and the results published. It appears&nbsp;that at the end of this year the sums allotted by the Russian government for defraying the expenses of these institutions amounted to 2,149,213 roubles, besides a gift of&nbsp;nearly 60,000 roubles towards erecting the new university.</span></p>
