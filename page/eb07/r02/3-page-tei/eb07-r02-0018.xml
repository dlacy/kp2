And accordingly none has been observed in the surface of a stream when this did not happen. But it also should happen with τespect to any declivity of bottom. Yet we know that water will hang on the sloping surface of a board without proceeding further. The cause of this 9eems to be the adhesion of the water, combined with its viscidity. The viscidity of fluid presents a certain force which must be overcome before any current can take place.</p><p>A series of important experiments were made by our author in order to ascertain the relation between the velocity at the surface of any stream and that at the bottom. These are curious and valuable on many accounts. One circumstance deserves our notice here, viz. that <hi rend="italic">the differences between the superfleial and bottom velocities of any stream arc proportional to the square roots of the superficial velocities. </hi>From what has becn already said on the gradual diminution of the velocities among the adjoining filaments, we must conclude that the same rule holds good with respect to the velocity of separation of two filaments immediately adjoining. Hence we learn that this velocity of separation is in all cases indefinitely small, and that we may, without danger of any sensible error, suppose it a constant quantity in all cases.</p><p>We think, with our ingenious author, that on a review of these circumstances, there is a constant or invariable portion of the accelerating force employed in overcoming this viscidity, and producing this mutual separation of the adjoining filaments. We may express this part of the accelerating force by a part of that slope which constitutes</p><p>b</p><p>the whole of it. If it were not employed in overcoming this resistance, it would produce a velocity which (on account of this resistance) is not produced, or is lost. This</p><p>A</p><p>would be    <hi rend="sub">r</hi>-—√—=■· This must therefore be taken from</p><p>√⅛ — L√S</p><p>the velocity exhibited by our general formula. When thus</p><p>corrected, it would become V = (√<hi rend="italic">d—</hi>0∙ 1 ) ( —=—^<hi rend="sup">π,</hi>√∙- -</p><p>∖√s-L√s+1∙6</p><p><hi rend="italic">V ng    </hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">    _    </hi>,    √πσ</p><p><hi rend="italic">--τz∙</hi>—-,—75 )∙ But as the term -=-=—= is com-</p><p>√S — L√⅛∕    √S — L√S</p><p>pounded only of constant quantities, we may express it by a single number. This has been collected from a scrupulous attention to the experiments (especially in canals and great bodies of water moving with very small velocities, in which case the effects of viscidity must become more remarkable), and it appears that it may be valued at √0∙09 inch, or 0∙3 inch very nearly.</p><p>From the whole of the foregoing considerations, drawn from nature, supported by such reasonings as our most distinct notions of the internal motions will admit, and authorized by a very extensive comparison with experiment, we are now in a condition to conclude a complete formula, expressive of the uniform motion of water, and involving every circumstance which appears to have any share in the operation.</p><p>Therefore, let</p><p>V represent the mean velocity, in inches per second, of any current of water, running uniformly, or which is in train, in a pipe or open channel, whose section, figure, and slope, are constant, but its length indefinite.</p><p><hi rend="italic">d</hi>  The hydraulic mean depth, that is, the quotient arising from dividing the section of the channel, in square inches, by its border, expressed in linear inches.</p><p>s The reciprocal of the slope of the pipe, or of the surface of the current.
