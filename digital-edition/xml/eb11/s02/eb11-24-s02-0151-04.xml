It is 49 m. N.E. from Metz and at the junction of lines from Trier, Bingerbrück and Zweibrücken. Pop. (1905) 24,140. Sankt Johann is the seat of extensive industries, the chief being the manufacture of railway plant and machinery, iron-founding, wire-drawing and brewing; its rapid industrial development is due mainly to the extensive railway system of which it is the centre.</p><p>Sankt Johann obtains its name from a chapel erected here. From 1321 to 1859 it formed a single town with Saarbrücken,</p><pb xml:id="eb11-24-s02-0152" facs="encyclopaediabri24chisrich_0169.jp2"/><p>and then was united to form one municipality with Saarbrücken and Malstatt-Burbach (united population, 90,000).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
