<p><span class="font0">ed slightly projecting tubercles. The scales on the under part of the tail are square and imbricated. Seba describes&nbsp;this as a Ceylonese species, and adds, that the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gecko</span><span class="font0"> is applied to it on account of its cry resembling that&nbsp;word. It is believed to occur throughout the Indian Archipelago. A belief prevails in the native country of this&nbsp;and other species, that an acrimonious fluid exudes from&nbsp;the lamellæ of the feet, and remaining on fruit, or other&nbsp;edible vegetation, is productive of injury to those who swallow it. A species is described by Bontius in his history&nbsp;of Java, under the name of Indian Salamander ; and that&nbsp;old author states that the Javanese are said to hold it up&nbsp;by the tail until it discharges a foam or sanies from the&nbsp;mouth, with which they poison their arrows.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sect. 2.—Hemydactyli. Base of the toes furnished with an oval disk, formed beneath by a double row of scales&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">en chevron ;</span><span class="font0"> from the centre of this disk the second joint&nbsp;springs, and bears the third or nail at its extremity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the known species of the hemydactylous division have five nails on each foot, and a range of pores on each&nbsp;side of the anus. The scales beneath the tail are in the&nbsp;form of broad bands, like those of many serpents. A grayish red kind ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G. Verruculatus,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv.) occurs in the southern&nbsp;countries of Europe. The body is beset with small, conical,&nbsp;slightly rounded tubercles, and circles of the same surround&nbsp;the tail. A nearly allied species (G. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mabuia,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv.) is widely spread over the warmer parts of the new world, where it&nbsp;often enters dwelling-houses, occurring apparently identical both in Bengal and Pondicherry. Cuvier presumes it&nbsp;may have been transported thither accidentally in ships.&nbsp;A species more peculiar to India is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G. marginatus,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv. of&nbsp;which the body is margined, and the tail flattened horizontally, with its edges sharp and slightly fringed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sect. 3.—Thecadactyli. Toes enlarged throughout their entire length, and furnished with transverse scales, which&nbsp;are divided by a deep longitudinal furrow, wherein the&nbsp;claw may lie entirely concealed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such as are clearly known do not want the claws except upon the thumbs. They have no pores upon the thighs,&nbsp;and the scales upon the tail are small. As an example,&nbsp;may be named the smooth, or, as it is sometimes called,&nbsp;the perfoliated gecko ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G. lœvis,</span><span class="font0"> Daud., </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stellio perfoliatus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Schneid.). The tail of this species in the natural or normal&nbsp;state is long, and surrounded by the usual fold ; but it is&nbsp;easily fractured, and the reproduced portion often assumes&nbsp;a bulbous form, with a tapering termination, not unlike a&nbsp;small turnip with its root. In this accidental condition it&nbsp;w<sup>τ</sup>as formerly described as a distinct species, under the title&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Locerta rapicauda.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sect. 4.—Ptyodactyli. Toes dilated only at the tips, and striated below. The dilatation is cleft, and the nail placed&nbsp;in the fissure. The whole of the toes are furnished with&nbsp;curved claws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In some the toes are free, and the tail rounded. Such is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G. Iobatus,</span><span class="font0"> Geoft., sometimes named the house-gecko. It&nbsp;is smooth, or at least both scales and tubercles are very&nbsp;small, the general colour reddish-gray speckled with brown.&nbsp;This species is common in houses in many of the countries&nbsp;on the southern and eastern parts of the Mediterranean. It&nbsp;is known in Cairo by the unlovely name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">αboυ burs,</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">father of the leprosy,</span><span class="font0"> because it is supposed to produce that&nbsp;dreadful malady by poisoning provisions with its feet. Has-selquist relates that he saw at Cairo two women and a girl&nbsp;at the point of death, in consequence of their having eaten&nbsp;some cheese over which this creature chanced to crawl.&nbsp;He likewise mentions a man who, having laid hold of a&nbsp;gecko, his hand became instantaneously covered with red&nbsp;inflamed pustules, which were as itchy as those produced&nbsp;by the stinging of a nettle. Cats are said to eat these reptiles ; and they are driven from the Egyptian kitchens by&nbsp;the odour of garlic. The house-gecko feeds on insects, and&nbsp;its eggs are equal in size to a small nut. Its voice resembles that of a frog.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In others the tail is bordered on both sides by a membrane, and the feet are semi-palmated. Baron Cuvier is of opinion that they are probably aquatic. The species are&nbsp;truly singular in their external aspect. Such is the fimbriated gecko ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G.flmbriatus,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv.), of which the form is much&nbsp;depressed, and the tail bordered by a lateral margin, which&nbsp;is also visible on the sides of the body, where, however, it&nbsp;becomes fringed or slashed. It is a native of Madagascar,&nbsp;where it is erroneously held in great dread. In Lacepède’s&nbsp;opinion, it connects together the cameleons, geckoes, and&nbsp;water-newts. It measures eight or nine inches in length ;&nbsp;and lives in trees, leaping from branch to branch. The&nbsp;colours of this species, like those of the cameleon, are very&nbsp;changeable, at least on the upper surface, the under portion being usually of a bright yellow. “ These changes,”&nbsp;says Dr Shaw, “ we are informed, have been observed in&nbsp;the living animal by Mons. Bruyeres in its native country,&nbsp;viz. Madagascar, where it is not very uncommon, and where,&nbsp;though a harmless animal, it is held in great abhorrence by&nbsp;the natives, who consider it of a poisonous nature, and fly&nbsp;from it with precipitation, pretending that it darts on their&nbsp;breast, and adheres with such force by its fringed membrane, that it cannot be separated from the skin without the&nbsp;assistance of a razor. The principal cause of this popular&nbsp;dread of the animal is its habit of running open mouthed&nbsp;towards the spectator, instead of attempting to escape when&nbsp;discovered. Its chief residence is on the branches of trees,&nbsp;where it lives on insects, holding itself secure by coiling its&nbsp;tail, short as it is, half round the twig on which it sits. It&nbsp;chiefly appears in rainy weather, when it moves with considerable agility, often springing from bough to bough. On&nbsp;the ground it walks but slowly, the fore-legs being shorter&nbsp;than the hinder.” @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An equally singular species of this section is the scolloptailed gecko ( </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G. Cuudiverbera),</span><span class="font0"> which has no fringe upon the body, but a very peculiarly indented margination on&nbsp;each side of the tail. It is of a blackish colour, measures&nbsp;above a foot in length, and was found by M. Feuille in a&nbsp;fountain of the Cordilleras. Some confusion exists in systematic works between this species and that figured by Seba&nbsp;under the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Salamandra aquatica ex Arabia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sect. 5.—Spheriodactyli. Toes terminated by a small cushion without folds ; the claws retractile.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such species as have the cushion double or notched in front are natives of the Cape of Good Hope and the East&nbsp;Indies. Example, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G. porphyrias,</span><span class="font0"> Daud. More frequently&nbsp;the cushion is rounded and simple, as in the species called&nbsp;the spitting gecko (G.</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sputator,</span><span class="font0"> Lac.), a small reptile, pleasingly marked by transverse bands of brown upon a reddish&nbsp;ground. It inhabits houses in St Domingo. A lizard described by Sparman under the same specific name, if not&nbsp;identical with the species just named, no doubt pertains to&nbsp;this genus. It is said when disturbed by a near approach&nbsp;to eject from its mouth a black and acrimonious fluid into&nbsp;the face of the spectator, causing an inflammation of the&nbsp;skin, which, however, is allayed by rubbing the part affected with camphorated spirits of wine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Finally, there are Saurians which, with all the characters</span></p>
