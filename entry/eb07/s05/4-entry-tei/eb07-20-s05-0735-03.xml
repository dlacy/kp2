a town in the ward of that name, in the county of Durham, 248 miles from London. It stands on the river Tees, which is navigable to it ; and consists principally of one well-built, long, and wide street, in which is the church, the town-hall, and grammar-school. It is an ancient borough, governed by a mayor, a recorder, and aldermen, but elects no members to the House of Commons. It formerly contained a castle, which has been demolished, and the stones applied to the erection of more modern buildings. The bridge over the Tees is an elegant object. The inhabitants carry on a considerable trade in making coarse linens, huccabacks, table-cloths, and sailcloths ; and several ships are built on the river. Stockton is well supplied with coals, vegetables, fruit, fish, and other necessaries ; and it has a market on Wednesday and another on Saturday. The number of inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 4009, in 1811 to 4229, in 1821 to 5006, and in 1831 to 7763.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
