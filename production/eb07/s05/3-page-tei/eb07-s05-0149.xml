He was the first who made use of blisters, using cantharides fur that purpose. Dissection in his time was prohibited under the severest penalties : his anatomical knowledge was therefore neither profound nor exact ; “ nevertheless he had the sound penetration to regard anatomy as the only legitimate basis on which either medical or surgical science could rest.” Heliodorus, the celebrated physician of the emperor Trajan, has left some excellent observations on injuries of the head ; and Antyllus, almost a contemporary, was a zealous and successful surgeon. He boldly recommends bronchotomy in cases of threatened suffocation induced by disease of the throat ; and, in inflammatory affections of emergency, advises arteriotomy in preference to venesection, showing that excessive loss of blood thereby need not be dreaded, it being readily prevented by dividing the artery completely across. He also alludes to the operation for cataract by extraction, which he however recommends very cautiously, and only when the cataract is small. He obtained the radical cure of hydrocele by free incision of the parts. Rufus the Ephesian, who seems also to have lived in the time of Trajan, was a zealous anatomist and surgeon, and has left a treatise on diseases of the kidneys and bladder. About the commencement of the second century, Archigenes the Syrian settled in Rome, and distinguished himself both in medicine and surgery. His writings, which were chiefly confined to the latter subject, are unfortunately lost. Between Celsus and Galen, however, we meet with no great Roman writer on medicine or surgery. These were among the last of the liberal arts that were encouraged by the Romans ; and the proud patricians refusing to educate any of their family to such a profession, the medical practitioners of Rome were at first importations from Greece and Alexandria, and afterwards sell-educated slaves and freedmen.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p><p>Claudius Galenus was born at Pergamus, in Asia Minor, in the 131st year of the Christian era. After studying at Smyrna and Corinth, he completed his medical education at Alexandria, and ultimately settled in Rome, where he soon obtained a great reputation, both as a successful practitioner, and as a public lecturer on anatomy. Professional jealousy of his talents, however, drove him from Rome, to which he did not return until recalled by Marcus Aurelius. Shortly afterwards he was appointed physician to the young emperor Commodus, with whom, as well as with the public, he rose to great favour, A man of great erudition, brilliant genius, and indomitable industry, he produced works which exerted a most powerful and extensive influence over medical practice. He has the merit of rescuing medical inquiry from the chaos in which he found it, and restoring it to the paths of light and nature. His fame indeed was so great as to prove, in one sense, detrimental to the advancement of the medical profession, inasmuch as his opinions were received as oracular in the schools of all the civilized countries for no less a period than 1300 years, thus seriously retarding further investigation. His works were both numerous and elaborate ; but unfortunately he seems to have been debarred from the study of the groundwork of his profession, human anatomy. His dissections appear to have been limited to the simiæ and other mammiferous animals, as most resembling the human structure, though on one occa</p><p>sion “ he felicitates himself on the opportunities he had enjoyed of examining two skeletons preserved in Alexandria, and recommends all anxious to obtain a thorough knowledge of osteology to repair to that city." In his early years; he practised surgery at Pergamus with marked success; but in Rome he seems to have confined himself almost entirely to medicine, excepting the occasional performance of phlebotomy : probably the valorous Romans had not yet lost their hatred and dread of the terrible operations of surgery. Like others, however, he was still so much of a general practitioner, as to practise pharmacy as well as medicine, with a little of surgery ; and he himself informs us, that he had a drug-shop in the Via Sacra. “ He established two general principles as the basis of all surgery—synthesis, or the reunion of parts—diaeresis, or their complete division, as by amputation or extirpation. In four cases he detected luxation of the femur backwards, a variety not mentioned by Hippocrates; and records two instances of spontaneous luxation of the same bone. He also treats of more than one species of hernia. But although in his writings we meet with a few bold chirurgical attempts, as in the application of the trepan to the sternum in a ease of empyema, yet it must be confessed that by far the greatest part of his surgery seems to have been confined to fomentations, ointments, and plasters, for external affections, together with the art of bandaging, a love for which he necessarily acquired at the Alexandrian schools ; and the employment of complicated machinery in fracture and dislocations.” His researches were not limited to medical science, but comprehended literature and philosophy.@@<hi rend="superscript">8</hi></p><p>The early Christians unfortunately appear to have injured medicine and surgery, by attributing to martyrs and their relics the power of healing wounds and curing diseases ; “acknowledging the active interference of demons and blessed spirits in the affairs of men, and leaving true philosophy in total abandonment." A Cimmerian gloom was then fast overspreading the world, by which science and art were destined to be long obscured ; and shortly after the time of Galen, we accordingly find the medical along with the other sciences encompassed by the dark clouds of ignorance and barbarism. One or two names however occur worthy of notice, but more from having preserved than advanced medical knowledge. Oribasius, a pupil of Zeno, lived in the time of the emperor Julian, whose friendship he enjoyed, and became a celebrated practitioner, as well as of great importance in the state. His works are principally compilations, though judicious and useful. His surgery is marked with timidity, discouraging operations, except in most extreme cases, and is chiefly confined to unguents and embrocations. He abstracted blood locally, by making deep and extensive scarifications, or rather incisions, with the knife; a proceeding somewhat resembling the important modern improvement in the treatment of erysipelas, but adopted under different circumstances, and with other objects in view.</p><p>During the fifth century the west was repeatedly invaded by the Huns, Goths, Alans, and Lombards. Science greatly suffered in consequence ; and no name worthy of remembrance is to be found, until, nearly two centuries after Oribasius, appeared Aëtius, a native of Amida, and a pupil of the</p><p><hi rend="superscript">@@@1</hi> On this subject, a remarkable controversy took place in England during the earlier part of last century. It was occasioned by Dr Mead's “ Oratio Anniversalia Harveiana, in Theatro R. Medicorum Londinensium Collegii habita, ad diem xvviii. Octobris, <hi rend="smallcaps">mdccxxiii.</hi> Adjecta est Dissertatio de Nummis quibusdam a Smyrnæis in Medicorum honorem percussis.” Loud. 1724, 4to. This was followed by n publication of Dr Middleton, “De Medicorum apud veteres Romanos degentium Conditione Dissertatio; qua, contra viros celebertimos Jacobum Sponium et Richardum Meadium, servilem atque ignobilem eam fuisse ostenditur.” Cantab. 1726, 4to. To this dissertation Dr Ward of Gresham College published an answer in 1727 : Middleton published the first part of a defence in 1728, and Ward having rejoined in the course of the same year, his antagonist prepared a second part, of which Dr Heberden printed a few copies in 1761, eleven years after the author's death.</p><p>@@@* Here we must refer our classical readers to a most important collection published under the title of “ Medicorum Graecorum Opera quæ exstant. Editionem curavit D. Carolus Gottlob Kühn, Professor Physiologue et Pathologiæ in Lilerarum Universitate Lipsiensi Publicus Ordinarius.” Lipsiæ, 1821—30, 26 tom. 8vo. Three of the volumes are each divided into two parts. This collection includes the works of Hippocrates, Aretæus, Dioscorides, and Galen. Dioscorides was edited by Sprengel, and the other writers by Kuhn.</p></body></text></TEI>
