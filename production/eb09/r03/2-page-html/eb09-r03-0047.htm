                true, elected or created by a new assembly, by&nbsp;the army of freeholders voting
                by their classes and&nbsp;centuries (comitia centuriata), and to this body was
                given&nbsp;also the right of passing laws; but nevertheless it was still&nbsp;by a
                vote of the 30 curies (lex curiata) that the supreme&nbsp;authority was formally
                conferred on the magistrates&nbsp;chosen by the centuries of freeholders, and both
                the choice&nbsp;of magistrates and the passing of laws still required
                the&nbsp;sanction of the patrician senators (patrum
                auctoritas).@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Nor, lastly, were the legal prerogatives of the
                senate&nbsp;altered, although it is probable that before long plebeians&nbsp;were
                admitted to seats, if not to votes, and though its&nbsp;importance was gradually
                increased by the substitution of&nbsp;an annual magistracy for the life-long rule of
                a single&nbsp;king. But the abolition of the monarchy brought with it&nbsp;a change
                of the utmost importance in the actual working&nbsp;of the constitution. Though the
                distinction between&nbsp;patricians and plebeians was at least as old as the
                state&nbsp;itself, it is not until the establishment of the republic that&nbsp;it
                plays any part in the history of Rome. No sooner,&nbsp;however, was the
                overshadowing authority of the king&nbsp;removed than a struggle commenced between
                the two&nbsp;orders which lasted for more than two centuries. It was&nbsp;in no
                sense a struggle between a conquering and a conquered class, or between an exclusive
                citizen body and an&nbsp;unenfranchised mass outside its pale.@@<sup>2</sup>
                Patricians and&nbsp;plebeians were equally citizens of Rome, sprung of the&nbsp;same
                race and speaking the same tongue. The former&nbsp;were the members of those ancient
                “ gentes ” which had&nbsp;possibly been once the “ chiefly ” families in the
                small&nbsp;communities which preceded the united state, and which&nbsp;claimed by
                hereditary right a privileged position in the&nbsp;community. Only patricians could
                sit in the council of&nbsp;patres, and hence probably the name given to their
                    order.@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>To their representatives the supreme authority
                reverted&nbsp;on the death of the king the due transmission of the&nbsp;auspicia and
                the public worship of the state gods were&nbsp;their special care; and to them alone
                were known the traditional usages and forms which regulated the life of
                the&nbsp;people from day to day. To the “ plebs ” (the multitude,&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">7tA?7#os)</span><span class="font1">
                belonged all who were not members of some&nbsp;patrician gens, whether independent
                freemen or attached&nbsp;as “clients”@@<sup>4</sup> to one of the great houses. The
                plebeian&nbsp;was a citizen, with civil rights and a vote in the assembly&nbsp;of
                the curies, but he was excluded by ancient custom from&nbsp;all share in the higher
                honours of the state, and intermarriage with a patrician was not recognized as a
                properly&nbsp;legal union.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The revolution which expelled the Tarquins gave the patricians, who
                had mainly assisted in bringing it about,&nbsp;an overwhelming ascendency in the
                state. The plebs had&nbsp;indeed gained something. Not only is it probable
                that&nbsp;the strictness of the old tie of clientship had somewhat&nbsp;relaxed, and
                that the number of the “clientes ” was smaller&nbsp;and their dependence on
                patrician patrons less complete,&nbsp;but the ranks of the plebs had, under the
                later kings, been&nbsp;swelled by the admission of conquered Latins, and
                the&nbsp;freeholders among these had with others been enrolled in&nbsp;the Servian
                tribes, classes, and centuries. The establishment of the republic invested this
                military levy of free-</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">holders with political rights as an assembly, for by their votes the
                consuls were chosen and laws passed, and it was&nbsp;the plebeian freeholders who
                formed the main strength of&nbsp;the plebs in the struggle that followed. But these
                gains&nbsp;were greater in appearance than in reality. The plebeian&nbsp;freeholders
                commanded only a minority of votes in the&nbsp;comitia centuriata. In their choice
                of magistrates they&nbsp;were limited to the patrician candidates nominated
                by&nbsp;patrician presiding magistrates, and their choice required&nbsp;confirmation
                not only by the older and smaller assembly of&nbsp;the curiae, in which the
                patricians and their clients predominated, but also by the patrician patres. They
                could&nbsp;only vote on laws proposed by patrician consuls, and here&nbsp;again the
                subsequent sanction of the patres was necessary.&nbsp;The whole procedure of the
                comitia was in short absolutely&nbsp;in the hands of their patrician presidents, and
                liable to&nbsp;every sort of interruption and suspension from
                patrician&nbsp;pontiffs and augurs.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">But these political disabilities did not constitute the main
                grievance of the plebs in the early years of the republic. What they fought for was
                protection for their lives&nbsp;and liberties, and the object of attack was the
                despotic&nbsp;authority of the patrician magistrates. The consuls wielded&nbsp;the
                full “imperium” of the kings, and against this “consular authority” the plebeian,
                though a citizen, had no&nbsp;protection and no appeal, and matters were only
                worse&nbsp;when for the two consuls was substituted in some emergency a single,
                all-powerful, irresponsible dictator. In&nbsp;Rome, as in Greece, the first efforts
                of the people were&nbsp;directed against the arbitrary powers of the
                executive&nbsp;magistrate.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The history of this struggle between the orders opens with a
                concession made to the plebs by one of the consuls&nbsp;themselves, a concession
                possibly due to a desire to secure&nbsp;the allegiance of the plebeian freeholders,
                who formed the&nbsp;backbone of the army. In the very first year of
                the&nbsp;republic, according to the received chronology, P. Valerius&nbsp;Poplicola
                carried in the comitia centuriata his famous law&nbsp;of appeal.@@<sup>5</sup> It
                enacted that no magistrate, saving only&nbsp;a dictator, should execute a capital
                sentence upon any&nbsp;Roman citizen unless the sentence had been confirmed
                on&nbsp;appeal by the assembly of the centuries. But, though the&nbsp;“ right of
                appeal ” granted by this law was justly regarded&nbsp;in later times as the greatest
                safeguard of a Roman’s&nbsp;liberties, it was by no means at first so effective a
                protection as it afterwards became. For not only was the&nbsp;operation of the law
                limited to the bounds of the city, so&nbsp;that the consul in the field or on the
                march was left as&nbsp;absolute as before, but no security was provided for
                its&nbsp;observance even within the city by consuls resolved to&nbsp;disregard
                it.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It was by their own efforts that the plebeians first' obtained any
                real protection against magisterial despotism.&nbsp;The traditional accounts of the
                first secession are con-;&nbsp;fused and contradictory@@<sup>6</sup> but its causes
                and results are&nbsp;tolerably clear. The seceders were the plebeian
                legionaries&nbsp;recently returned from a victorious campaign, indignant&nbsp;at the
                delay of the promised reforms, they ignored the&nbsp;order given them to march
                afresh against Volsci and Aiqui,&nbsp;and instead entrenched themselves on a hill
                across the&nbsp;Anio, some three miles from Rome, and known afterwards&nbsp;as the
                Mons Sacer. The frightened patricians came to&nbsp;terms, and a solemn agreement
                (lex sacrata)@@<sup>7 </sup>was concluded between the orders, by which it was
                provided that&nbsp;henceforth the plebeians should have annual magistrates&nbsp;of
                their own (tribuni plebis), members of their own order,&nbsp;who should be
