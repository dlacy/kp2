<hi rend="smallcaps">Sir George</hi> [(1650-1709), naval commander, was born near Canterbury in 1650. Entering the navy as a volunteer, he became post-captain in 1680, and vice-admiral in 1692. In May of this year he greatly distinguished himself in a night attack on the French fleet off Cape La Hogue, when he succeeded in burning six of their ships. Shortly afterwards he received the honour of knighthood and a reward of ,Â£1000. In 1702 he commanded the expedition against Cadiz, and on the passage home captured the Plate fleet off Vigo. Along with Sir Cloudesley Shovel he took part in the capture of Gibraltar, 21st July 1704. On 13th August of the same year he attacked the French fleet off Malaga, the battle being drawn. On account of the dissatisfaction expressed indirectly at the result of the contest, he retired from the service in February 1705. He died 24th January 1709.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">The Life and Glorious Actions of Sir George Rooke,</hi> 1707.</p>
