<p><span class="font0">But when the empire ſeemed thus ready to ſink at once, it ſuddenly revived on the death of Gallienus,&nbsp;who was murdered by Martian, one of his own generals, while he beſieged Aureolus, one of the tyrants,&nbsp;in Milan. His death gave general ſatisſaction to all,&nbsp;except his ſoldiers, who hoped to reap the reward of&nbsp;their treachery by the plunder of Milan. But being&nbsp;fruſtrated in theſe expectations, and in ſome meaſure&nbsp;kept within bounds by the largeſſes of Martian, Flavius Claudius was nominated to ſucceed, and joyfully&nbsp;accepted by all orders of the ſtate, and his title confirmed by the ſenate and the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are not ſufficiently aſſured of this emperor’s lineage and country. Some affirm that he was born in Dalmatia, and deſeended from an ancient family there ;&nbsp;others aſſert that he was a Trojan ; and others, that he&nbsp;was ſon to the emperor Gordian. But, whatever might&nbsp;have been his deſcent, his merits were by no means&nbsp;doubtful. He was a man of great valour and conduct,&nbsp;having performed the moſt eminent ſervices againſt the&nbsp;Goths, w</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ho </span><span class="font0">had long continued to make irruptions into the empire. He was now about 55 years old, equally remarkable ſor the ſtrength of his body and the vigour of his mind ; he was chaſte and temperate, a rewarder of the good, and a ſevere puniſher of ſuch as&nbsp;tranſgreſſed the laws. Thus endowed, therefore, he in&nbsp;ſome meaſure put a ſtop to the precipitate decline of&nbsp;the empire, and once more ſeemed to reſtore the glory&nbsp;of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His firſt ſucceſs, upon being made emperor, was againſt Aureolus, whom he defeated near Milan. His&nbsp;next expedition was to oppoſe the Goths, againſt whom&nbsp;he led a very numerous army. Theſe barbarians had&nbsp;made their principal and moſt ſucceſsful irruptions into&nbsp;Thrace and Macedonia, ſwarmed over all Greece, and&nbsp;had pillaged the famous city of Athens, which had long&nbsp;been the ſchool of all the polite arts to the Romans.&nbsp;The Goths, however, had no veneration for thoſe em-belliſhments that tend to ſoften and humanize the mind,&nbsp;but deſtroyed all monuments of taſte and learning with&nbsp;the moſt ſavage alacrity. It was upon one of theſe occaſions, that, having heaped together a large pile of&nbsp;books in order to burn them, one of the commanders&nbsp;diſſuaded them from the deſign, alleging, that the time&nbsp;which the Grecians ſhould waſte on books would only&nbsp;render them more unqualified ſor war. But the empire&nbsp;ſeemed to tremble, not only on that ſide, but almoſt on&nbsp;every quarter. At the ſame time, above 300,000 of&nbsp;theſe barbarians (the Heruli, the Trutangi, the Virtur-gi, and many nameleſs and uncivilized nations) came&nbsp;down the river Danube, with 2000 ſhips, fraught with&nbsp;men and ammunition, ſpreading terror and devaſtation&nbsp;on every ſide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this ſtate of univerſal diſmay, Claudius alone </span><span class="font1">ſeem-</span><span class="font0">ed to continue unſhaken. He marched hie diſpropor-tioned army againſt the ſavage invaders ; and though but ill prepared for ſuch an engagement, as the forces&nbsp;Of the empire were then employed in different parts of&nbsp;the world, he came off victorious, and made an incredible ſlaughter of the enemy. The whole of their great&nbsp;army was cither cut to pieces or taken priſoners : houſes&nbsp;were filled with their arms ; and ſcarce a province of the&nbsp;empire, that was not furniſhed with ſlaves from thoſe&nbsp;that ſurvived the defeat. Theſe ſucceſſes were followed&nbsp;by many others in different parts of the empire; fothat</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the Goths, ſor a conſiderable time aſtcr, made but a ſeeble oppoſition. He ſome time after marched againſt&nbsp;the revolted Germans, and overthrew them with conſiderable ſlaughter. His laſt expedition was to oppoſe Tetricus and Zenobia, his two pniſſant rivals in the empire.&nbsp;But on his march, as he approached near Sirmium, in&nbsp;Pannonia, he was ſeized with a peſtilential fever, of&nbsp;which he died in a ſew days, to the great regret of his&nbsp;ſubjects, and the irreparable loſs of the Roman empire. His reign, which was not quite two years&nbsp;continuance, was active and ſucceſsful ; and ſuch is&nbsp;the character given of him by hiſtorians, that he is&nbsp;ſaid to have united in himſelf the moderation of Auguſtus, the valour of Trajan, and the piety of Anto∙∙&nbsp;ninus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Immediately after the death of Claudius, the army made unanimous choice of Aurelian, who was at that&nbsp;time maſter of the horſe, and eſteemed the moſt valiant&nbsp;commander of his time. However, his promotion was&nbsp;not without oppoſition on the part of the ſenate, as&nbsp;Quintilius, the brother of the deceaſed emperor, put in&nbsp;his claim, and was ſor a while acknowledged at Rome.&nbsp;But his authority was of very ſhort duration ; for find·&nbsp;ing himſelf abandoned by thoſe who at firſt inſtigated&nbsp;him to declare for the throne, he choſe to prevent the&nbsp;ſeverity of his rival by a voluntary death, and cauſing&nbsp;his veins to be opened, expired, after having reigned&nbsp;but 17 days.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Aurelian being thus univerſally acknowledged by all the ſtates of the empire, aſſumed the command,&nbsp;with a greater ſhow of power than his predeceſſors&nbsp;had enjoyed for ſome time before. This active monarch was born of mean and obſcure parentage in Dacia, and was about 55 years old at the time of his coming to the throne. He had ſpent the earjy part of&nbsp;his life in the army, and had riſen through all the gradations of military duty. He was of unſhaken courage&nbsp;and amazing ſtrength ; he in one engagement killed 40&nbsp;of the enemy with his own hand, and above 900 at&nbsp;ſeveral different times. In ſhort, hie valour and expedition were ſuch, that he was compared to Julius Cæſar ; and, in fact, only wanted mildneſs and clemency to&nbsp;be every way his equal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The whole of this monarch’s reign was ſpent in repreſſing the irruptions of the northern nations, in humbling every other pretender to the empire, and puniſhing the monſtrous irregularities of his own ſubjects.&nbsp;He defeated the Marcαmanni, that had invaded Italy,&nbsp;in three ſeveral engagements, and at length totally deſtroyed their army. He was not leſs ſucceſsful againſt&nbsp;Zenobia, the queen of the Eaſt, a woman of the moſt&nbsp;heroic qualifications, who had long diſclaimed the Roman power, and eſtabliſhed an empire of her own, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is related under the article Palmyra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Aurelian having thus brought back peace to the empire, endeavoured, by the rigours of juſtice, to&nbsp;bring back virtue alſo. He was very ſtrict in puniſhing the crimes of the ſoldiery : in his orders to his lieutenants, he inſiſted that the peaſants ſhould not be plundered upon any pretences ; that not even a grape, a&nbsp;grain of ſalt, or a drop of oil, ſhould be exacted unjuſtly. He cauſed a ſoldier, who had committed adultery with his hoſteſs, to have his ſeet tied to the tops&nbsp;of two trees, forcibly bent at top to meet each other ;&nbsp;which being let looſe, and ſuddenly recoiling, tore the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
