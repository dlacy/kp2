The queen immediately informed them of the thraldom and tyranny in which ſhe had been kept; and among other things declared, that ſhe was ſtill a virgin, as her jailors obliged her to keep ſeparate from her huſband. The Engliſh, being matters of the caſtle, ordered a bed to be prepared that very night for the king and queen; and Henry, hearing of the ſucceſs of his party, ſent a ſafe-conduct for the royal pair to meet him at Alnwick. Robert de Roſs was ſummoned by Henry to anſwer for his conduct; but throwing himſelf at the king’s feet, he was puniſhed only by the ſequeſtration of his eſtate, as was John Baliol by a heavy fine, which the king of England reſerved entirely to his own uſe.</p><p>Alexander and his queen were attended to Alnwick by the heads of their party; and when they arrived, it was agreed that Henry ſhould act as his ſon-in-law’s guardian; in conſequence of which, ſeveral regulations were made in order to ſuppreſs the exorbitant power of the Cummins. That ambitious family, however, were all this time privately ſtrengthening their party in Scotland, though they outwardly appeared ſatisfied with the arrangements which had been made. This rendered Alexander ſecure; ſo that, being off his guard, he was ſurpriſed when aſleep in the caſtle of Kinroſs by the earl of Menteith, who carried him to Stirling. The Cummins were joined in this treaſon by Sir Hugh de Abernethy, Sir David Lochore, and Sir Hugh de Barclay; and, in the mean time, the whole nation was thrown into the utmoſt confuſion. The great ſeal was forcibly taken from Robert Stuterville, ſubſtitute to the chancellor the biſhop of Dunkeld; the eſtates of the Toyaliſts were plundered; and even the churches were not ſpared. The king at laſt was delivered by the death of the earl of Menteith, who is ſaid to have been poiſoncd by his wife, in order to gratify her paſſion for  young Engliſh gentleman named <hi rend="italic">John Ruſſel.</hi> This charge, however, was never proved; but it is certain that the earl died at a juncture very critical for Scotland, and that his death diſconcerted all the ſchemes of his party, which never afterwards could make head againſt the royaliſts.</p><p>Alexander being thus reſtored to the exerciſe of regal authority, acted with great wiſdom and moderation. He pardoned the Cummins and their adherents, upon their ſubmitting to his authority; after which, he applied himſelf to the regulation of his other affairs: but a ſtorm was now ready to break upon him from another quarter. We have already ſeen, that the uſurper Donald Bane, brother to Malcom Canmore, had engaged to deliver up the iſles of Orkney and Shetland to the king of Norway, for aſſiſting him in making good his pretenſions to the crown of Scotland. Haquin, the king of Norway, at this time alleged, that theſe engagements extended to the delivering up the Hands of Bute, Arran, and others in the Frith of Clyde, as belonging to the Ebudae or Weitem iſles; and as Alexander did not think proper to comply with theſe demands, the Norwegian monarch appeared with a fleet of 160 fail, having on board 20, 000 troops,</p><p>who landed and took the caſtle of Air. Alexander immediately diſpatched ambaſſadors to enter into a treaty with Haquin; but the latter, fluſhed with ſucceſs, would hearken to no terms. He made himſelf maſter of the iſles' of Bute and Arran; after which he paſſed over to Cunningham. Alexander, preparcd to oppoſe him, divided his army into three bodies. The firſt was commanded by Alexander high ſteward of Scotland (the great grandfather of Robert II. ), and conſiſted of the Argyle, Athol, Lenox, and Galloway men. The ſecond was compoſed of the inhabitants of Lothian, Fife, Merſe, Berwick, and Stirling, under the command of Patrick earl of Dunbar. The king himſelf led the centre, which conſiſted of the inhabitants of Perthſhire, Angus, Mearns, and the northern counties. — Haquin, who was an excellent commander, diſpoſed his men in order of battle, and the engagement began at a place called <hi rend="italic">Largs.</hi> Both parties fought with great reſolution; but at laſt the Norwegians were defeated with dreadful ſlaughter, no fewer than 16,00 of them being killed on the ſpot. The remainder eſcaped to their ſhips; which were ſo completely wrecked the day after, that Haquin could ſcarce find a veffel to carry him with a few friends to Orkney, where he ſoon after died of grief.</p><p>In conſequence of this victory, Owen or John king of the iſland of Man ſubmitted to Alexander; and his example was followed by ſeveral other princes of the iſlands belonging to the Norwegians. Haquin’s ſon, Magnus, a wiſe and learned prince, ſoon after arrived in Scotland with freſh reinforcements, and propoſed a treaty: but Alexander, inſtead of liſtening to an accommodation, ſent the earls of Buchan and Murray, with Allen the chamberlain, and a conſiderable body of men, to the weſtern iſlands, where they put to the ſword ſome of the inhabitants, and hanged their chiefs for having encouraged the Norwegian invaſion. In the mean time, Magnus returned to Norway; where a treaty was at laſt concluded between him and Alexander. By this Magnus renounced all right to the conteſted iſlands; Alexander at the ſame time conſenting to pay him 1000 merks of ſilver in the ſpace of two years, and 100 yearly ever after, as an acknowledgement for theſe iſlands. To cement the friendſhip more firmly, a marriage was concluded between Margaret the daughter of Alexander, and Eric the ſon and heir of Magnus, who was alſo a child; and, ſome years after, when the parties were of proper age, the marriage was conſummated.</p><p>From this time to the acceſſion of Edward I. of England, we find nothing remarkable in the hiſtory of Scotland. That prince, however, proved a more cruel enemy to this country than it had ever experienced. Alexander was preſent at the coronation of Edward, who was then newly arrived from the Holy Land, where he had been on a cruſade. Soon after this Alexander paid him homage for his Engliſh eſtates; particularly for the lands and lordſhip of Penrith and others, which Henry had given him along with his daughter. He proved an excellent ally to Edward in his wars againſt the French; and the latter paſſed a charter, by which he acknowledged that the ſervices of the king of Scotland in thoſe wars were not in conſequence of his holding lands in England, but as an ally to his crown. Even at this time, however, Edward</p></body></text></TEI>
