However, vehement rains in many .countries are found to be attended with barrenneſs and poornefs of the lands, and miſcarriage of thc crops in the ſucceeding year : and the reaſon is plain ; for thefe exceſſive ſtorms waſh away the fine mould into the rivers, which carry it into the fea, and it is a long time before the land recovers itſelf again. The remedy to the fa-mine, which ſome countries are ſubject to from this fort of mifchief, is the planting large orchards and groves oſ ſuch trees as bear eſculent fruit ; for it is an old ob-ſervation, that in years, when grain ſucceeds worſt, th'eſe trees produce moſt fruit of all. It may partly be owing to the thorough moiſtening of the earth, as deep as their roots go by thefe rains, and partly to their trunks ſtopping part of the light mould carried down by the rains, and by this means furniſhing themſelves with a coat of new earth.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Preternatural Rains,</hi>  we have numerous accounts, in the hiſtorians of our own as well as other countries, of preternatural rains ; ſuch as the raining of ſtones, of duſt, of blood, nay, and of living animals, as young frogs, and the like. We are not to doubt the truth of what thofe who are authors of veracity and credit relate to us of this kind, ſo far as to ſuppoſe that the falling of ſtones and duſt never happened ; the whole miſtake is, the fuppoſing them to have fallen from the clouds : but as to the blood and frogs, it is very certain that they never fell at all, but the opinion has been a mere deception of the eyes. Men are extremely fond of the marvellous in their relations ; but the judicious reader is to examine ſtrictly whatever is reported oſ this kind, and is not to ſuffer himſelf to be deceived.</p><p>There are two natural methods by which quantities of ſtones and duſt may fall in certain places, without thcir having been generated in the clouds or fallen as rain. The one is by means of hurricanes : the wind which we frequently ſee tearing off the tiles of houſes, and carrying them to conſiderable diſtances, being equally able to take up a quantity of ſtones, and drop them again at ſome other place. But the other, which is much</p><lb/><p>the moſt powerful, and probably the moſt uſual way, is for ſhe eruptions of volcanoes and burning mountaina to toſs up, as they frequently do, a vaſt quantity of ſtones, aſhes, and cinders, to an immenſe height in the air : and theſe, being hurried away by the hurricanes and impetuous winds which ufually accompany thoſe eruptions, and being in themſelves much lighter than common ſtones, as being half calcined, may eaſily be thus carried to vaſt diſtances ; and there ſailing in pla-ces where the inhabitants know nothing of the occaſion, they cannot but be ſuppofed by the vulgar to fall on them from the clouds. It is well known, that, in the great eruptions of Ætna and veſuvius, ſhowers of aſhes, duſt, and ſmall cinders, have been ſeen to obſcure the air, and overſpread the ſurſace of the fea for a σ<hi rend="sub">r</hi>eat way, and cover the decks of ſhips ; and this at ſuch a diſtance, as it ſhould appear ſcarce conceivable that they ſhould have been carried to : and probably, if the ac-counts of all the ſhowers of thefe ſubſtances mentioned by authors be collected, they will all be found to have fallen within ſuch diſtances of volcanoes ; and if compared as to the time of their falling, will be found to correſpond in that alſo with the eruptions of thofe mountains. AVe have known inſtances of the aſhes from veſuvius having been carried thirty, nay, forty leagues, and peculiar accidents may have carried them yet farther. It is not to be ſuppofed that theſe ſhowers of ſtones and duſt fall for a continuance in the manner of ſhowers of rain, or that the fragments or pieces are as frequent as drops of water ; it is ſufficient that a number of ſtones, or a quantity of duſt, fall at once on a place, where the inhabitants can have no knowledge of the part from whence they came, and the vulgar will not doubt their dropping from the clouds. Nay,in the canton of Berne in Swiſſerland, the inhabitants accounted it &amp; miracle that it rained earth and ſulphur upon them at a time that a ſmall volcano terrified them ; and even while the wind was ſo boiſterous, and hurricanes ſo frequent, that they ſaw almoſt every moment the duſt, ſand, and little ſtones torn up from the ſurface of the earth in whirlwinds, and carried to a conſiderable height in the air, they never conſider¢d that both the ſulphur thrown up by the volcano, and the duſt, &amp;c. carried from their feet muſt fall ſoon after ſomewhere. It is very certain that in ſome of the terrible ſtorms of large hail, where the hail-ſhmes have been of many inches round, on breaking them there have been found what people have called<hi rend="italic">flones in their middle;</hi>  but theſe obſervers needed only to have waited the diffolving of one of theſe hail-ſtones, to have ſeen the ſtone in its centre diſunite alſo, it being only formed oſ the parti-cles of looſe earthy matter, which the water, exhaled by the fun’s heat, had taken up in extremely ſmall mole-culæ with it ; and this only having ſerved to give an opake hue to the inner part of the congelation, to which the freezing of the water alone gave the apparent hard-neſs of ſtone.</p><p>The raining of <hi rend="italic">blood</hi>  has been ever accounted a more terrible ſight and a more fatal omen than the other preternatural rains already mentioned. It is very certain that nature forms blood nowhere but in the veffels of animals; and therefore ſhowers of it from the clouds are by no means to be credited. Thofe who ſuppoſe that what has been taken for blood has been actually ſeen falling through the air, have had recourſe to flying infects for its origin, and ſuppoſe it the eggs or dung of</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
