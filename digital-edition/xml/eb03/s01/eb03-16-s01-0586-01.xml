a ſect of Chriſtians of the 3d century, that embraced the opinions of Sabellius, a philoſopher of Egypt, who openly taught that there is but one perſon in the Godhead.</p><p>The Sabellians maintained, that the Word and the Holy Spirit are only virtues, emanations, or functions of the Deity; and held, that he who is in heaven is the Father of all things, that he deſcended into the virgin, became a child, and was born of her as a ſon; and that having accompliſhed the myſtery of our ſalvation, he diffuſed himſelf on the apoſtles in tongues of fire, and was then denominated the <hi rend="italic">Ηoly Ghοst.</hi> This they explained by resembling God to the ſun, the illuminative virtue or quality of which was the Word, and its warming virtue the Holy Spirit. The Word, they taught, was darted, like a divine ray, to accompliſh the work of redemption; and that being reaſcended to heaven, the influences of the Father were communicated after a like manner to the apoſtles.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
