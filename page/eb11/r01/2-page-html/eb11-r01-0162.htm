<p><span class="font2">Theodoric, who, ten days after his entry into the city, slew his rival at a banquet in the palace of the Laurel Grove (March 15,&nbsp;493). Ravenna was Theodoric’s chief place of residence, and&nbsp;his reign (493-526) may be considered the time of its greatest&nbsp;splendour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nine years after the death of Theodoric Justinian sent an army to destroy the Gothic monarchy and restore Italy to the empire.&nbsp;Long after the Goths had lost Rome they still clung to Ravenna,&nbsp;till at length, weary of the feebleness of their own king, Vitiges,&nbsp;and struck with admiration of their heroic conqueror, they offered&nbsp;to transfer their allegiance to Belisarius on condition of his&nbsp;assuming the diadem of the Western Empire. Belisarius dallied&nbsp;with the proposal until he had obtained an entrance within the&nbsp;walls of the capital, and proclaimed his inviolable fidelity to&nbsp;Justinian. Thus in the year 539 was Ravenna re-united to&nbsp;the Roman empire. Its connexion with that empire—or, in&nbsp;other words, its dependence upon Constantinople—lasted for&nbsp;more than 200 years, during which period, under the rule of&nbsp;Narses and his successors the exarchs, Ravenna was the seat&nbsp;of Byzantine dominion in Italy. In 728 the Lombard king&nbsp;Luitprand took and destroyed the suburb Classis; about 752&nbsp;the city itself fell into the hands of his successor Aistulf, from&nbsp;whom a few years after it was wrested by Pippin, king of the&nbsp;Franks. By this time the alteration of the coast-line and the&nbsp;filling up of the lagoons had probably commenced, and no&nbsp;historical importance attaches to its subsequent fortunes. It&nbsp;formed part of the Frankish king’s donation to the pope in the&nbsp;middle of the 8th century, though the archbishops, as a fact,&nbsp;retained almost independent power. It was an independent&nbsp;republic, generally taking the Guelph side in the 13th century,&nbsp;subject to rulers of the house of Polentani in the 14th, Venetian&nbsp;in the 15th (1441), and papal again in the 16th,—Pope Julius&nbsp;II. having succeeded in wresting it from the hands of the&nbsp;Venetians. St Romuald and St Peter Damian were both&nbsp;natives of Ravenna. From this time (1509) down to our own&nbsp;days, except for the interruptions caused by the wars of the&nbsp;French Revolution, Ravenna continued subject to the papal&nbsp;see and was governed by a cardinal legate. In 1849 Garibaldi’s&nbsp;wife Anita, who had accompanied him on his retreat from Rome,&nbsp;succumbed to fatigue in the marshes near Ravenna. In 1859&nbsp;it was one of the first cities to give its vote in favour of Italian&nbsp;unity, and it has since then formed a part of the kingdom of&nbsp;Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Charles the Great carried off the brazen statue of Theodoric and the marble columns of his palace to his own palace at&nbsp;Aix-la-Chapelle. More than five centuries later (1320) Dante&nbsp;became the guest of Guido Novello di Polenta, lord of Ravenna,&nbsp;and here he died on the 14th September of the following year.&nbsp;The marble urn containing the body of the poet still rests at&nbsp;Ravenna, where what Byron calls “ a little cupola more neat&nbsp;than solemn’’ has been erected over it. In 1512 (see below)&nbsp;the French army under Gaston de Foix fought a fierce battle&nbsp;with the Spanish, Venetian, and papal troops on the banks of&nbsp;the Ronco about two miles from Ravenna. The French were&nbsp;victorious, but Gaston fell in the act of pursuing the enemy.&nbsp;His death is commemorated by the Colonna dei Francesi erected&nbsp;on the spot where he fell. Lord Byron resided at Ravenna&nbsp;for eighteen months in 1820-21, attracted by the charms of&nbsp;the Countess Guiccioli.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Battle of 1512.</span><span class="font2">—This battle, one of the principal events of the long Italian wars of Charles VIII., Louis XII., and Francis I.&nbsp;of France, is, like Marignano, interesting in a tactical sense,&nbsp;from the fact that the feudalism of the past and the expert&nbsp;soldiership of the future were strangely mingled. It arose out&nbsp;of the attempt of the Spanish and Italian forces to relieve</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Ravenna, besieged by Gaston de Foix, duke of Nemours. The most celebrated captains of these wars were present on either&nbsp;side—under Gaston de Foix were Bayard, Yves d'Allègre, La&nbsp;Palisse; and under Cardona the Spanish viceroy of Naples, Pedro&nbsp;Navarro the great engineer, and Pescara the originator of the&nbsp;Spanish tactical system. After some preliminary manoeuvres&nbsp;the two armies drew up face to face on the left bank of the&nbsp;Roneo, the Spanish left and the French right resting on this&nbsp;river. The Spaniards were entrenched, with their heavy&nbsp;artillery distributed along the front, but, thanks to Navarro,&nbsp;they had a more mobile artillery in the shape of 200 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">arquebuses&nbsp;à croc</span><span class="font2"> mounted in groups upon carts, after the German fashion,&nbsp;and this was held ready to move wherever its services might be&nbsp;needed. The left wing was composed of the papal contingent,&nbsp;6000 infantry and 800 gendarmes under Fabrizio Colonna;&nbsp;the centre, of half the Spanish contingent, 4000 infantry and 600&nbsp;lancers under the viceroy; the right, of 1000 light horse under&nbsp;Pescara. Behind the centre was the rest of the Spanish con-tingent, 600 lancers and 4000 infantry. On the other side the&nbsp;right wing was commanded by the duke of Ferrara, who had like&nbsp;Navarro organized a mobile field artillery (the artillery material&nbsp;of this prince was thought to be the best conditioned in Europe).&nbsp;It consisted besides of 800 French gendarmes under Louis de&nbsp;Brézé and 5000 German landsknechts under Jakob Empser.&nbsp;In the centre were 8000 French infantry (the ancestors of the&nbsp;later Picardie and Piedmont regiments) under the seigneur&nbsp;de Molart, and 5000 Italian infantry. On the left were the&nbsp;light horse. A reserve of 600 gendarmes under La Palisse was&nbsp;behind the centre. The battle opened with a prolonged cannon-ade from the Spanish lines. For three hours the professional&nbsp;regiments of all sorts in the French lines rivalled one another&nbsp;in enduring the fire unmoved, the forerunners of the military&nbsp;systems of to-day, landsknechts, Picardie and Piedmont, show-ing the feudal gendarmerie that they too were men of honour.&nbsp;There was no lying down. The captains placed themselves in&nbsp;the front, and in the centre 38 out of 40 of them were struck&nbsp;down. Molart and Empser, drinking each other’s health in the&nbsp;midst of the cannonade, were killed by the same shot. Sheltered&nbsp;behind the entrenchments, the Spaniards scarcely suffered,&nbsp;for they were lithe active troops accustomed to lie down and&nbsp;spring up from the ground. But after three hours, Pescara’s&nbsp;light horse having meantime been driven in by the superior&nbsp;light horse of the enemy, the artillery-loving duke of Ferrara&nbsp;conceived the brilliant plan of taking his mobile field-guns to&nbsp;the extreme right of the enemy. This he did, and so came in&nbsp;sight of the prone masses of the Spaniards. Disciplined troops&nbsp;as they were, they resisted the temptation to escape Ferrara’s&nbsp;fire by breaking out to the front; but the whole Spanish line&nbsp;was </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">enfiladed</span><span class="font2">, and on the left of it the papal troops, who were&nbsp;by no means of the same quality, filled up the ditch in front&nbsp;of their breastworks and charged forward, followed by all the&nbsp;gendarmerie. Once in the plain they were charged by the&nbsp;French gendarmes under Gaston himself, as well as by the lands-knechts, and driven back. The advantage of position being&nbsp;thus lost, the Spanish infantry rose and flung itself on the&nbsp;attackers; the landsknechts and the French bands were disordered by the fury of the counterstroke, being unaccustomed&nbsp;to deal with the swift, leaping, and crouching attack of swords-men with bucklers. But La Palisse’s reserve wheeled in upon&nbsp;the rear of the Spaniards, and they retreated to the entrenchments as fast as they had advanced. The papal infantry, the&nbsp;gendarmes, and the light horse had already vanished from the&nbsp;field in disorder; but the Spanish regulars were of different&nbsp;mettle, and it was only after a long struggle that the lands-knechts and the French bands broke into the entrenchments.&nbsp;A captain of landsknechts, Fabian by name, holding his long&nbsp;pike crosswise, brought it down with all his force upon the&nbsp;opposing spears, and at the cost of his life made a narrow gap&nbsp;through which the French broke into the mass of the enemy.&nbsp;Still the conflict continued, but at last La Palisse, with all the&nbsp;gendarmerie still in hand, rode completely round the entrenchments and charged the Spaniards’ rear again.
