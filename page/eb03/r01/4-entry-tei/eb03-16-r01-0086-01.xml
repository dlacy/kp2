<p><label>REPUTATION</label>
means credit, honour, or the character of good ; and ſince we are deſtined to live in ſociety, is neceſſary and uſeful more or leſs to every human being. There is no man, except one who is overgrown with pride and ſelf-conceit, or whoſe actions are bad, but pays attention to his reputation, and wiſhes to poſſeſs the good opinion of his neighbours or the world. The love of reputation and of fame are moſt powerful ſprings of action ; but though they proceed .from the ſame principle, the means of attaining them, and the effects of them, are not altogether the fame.</p><p>Many means indeed ſerve equally to ſupport the refutation and to increaſe the fame, differing only in degrees; others, however, bel-mg peculiarly either to the one -or to the other. An honeſt reputation is within the reach -of the bulk of mankind; it is obtained by the ſocial virtues and the conſtant practice of the common duties of life. This kind of reputation indeed is neither extensive nor brilliant, but it is ften the moſt uſeful in point of happinefs. Wit, talents, and genius, are the neceffary requiſttes for fame ; but thoſe advantages are perhaps leſs real in their conſequences than thoſe aiding from a good reputation, what is of real uſe coils little ; things rare and fplendid require the greateſt la-hour to procure, and yield perhaps a more ideal happineſs.</p><p>Fame can be poſſeſſed, comparatively ſpeaking, but •by few individuals ; as it requires either very ſuperior abilities, ſupported by great efforts, or very fortunate circumſtances. It is conſtituted by the applauſe of mankind, or at leaſt by that of a. ſingle nation ; whilſt reputation is of much leſs extent, and ariſes from different circumftances. I hat reputation which is founded on deceit and artifice is never ſolid ; and the moſt honourable will always be found to be the moſt uſeful. Every one may ſafely, and indeed ought to, afpire to the conſideration and praiſe due to his condition and merit ; bur hc who aſpires to moi e, or who ſeeks it by diſhoneſt means, will at length meet with contempt.</p>
