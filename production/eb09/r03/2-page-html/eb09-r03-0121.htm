            <p><span class="font3">The use of mortar with opus quadratum is a sign of an early
                    rather than a late date.@@<sup>1</sup> It occurs in the Servian wall on
                    the&nbsp;Aventine, in the</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">Tabularium,and, most striking of&nbsp;all, in the Tul-Iianum
                    under&nbsp;the <sup>u</sup>Mamertine&nbsp;prison” — certainly one of
                    the&nbsp;oldest buildings&nbsp;in Rome (see fig.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">11). Under the empire massive&nbsp;blocks, whether&nbsp;of tufa,
                    travertine, or marble,&nbsp;are set without&nbsp;any mortar. It&nbsp;must,
                    however,&nbsp;be observed that&nbsp;in these early&nbsp;instances the&nbsp;“
                    mortar ” is but&nbsp;a thin stratum&nbsp;of lime, little&nbsp;thicker
                    than&nbsp;stout&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;paper,</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">used not as a cement to bind&nbsp;the blocks together,
                    but&nbsp;simply to give&nbsp;the joints a&nbsp;smoothly
                    fitting&nbsp;surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">actual binding together was&nbsp;done by clamps&nbsp;and dowels,
                    as&nbsp;well as by the&nbsp;mass and weight&nbsp;of the great&nbsp;blocks used.
                    Except in the earliest masonry,&nbsp;each block was</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">Verycarefully fastened, not only to the next blocks on the same
                    course, which was done with double dove-tailed dowels of wood, but also
                    to&nbsp;those above and below with stout iron clamps, run with lead
                    (Vitr.,&nbsp;ii. 8).@@<sup>2</sup> In more ornamental marble</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">work bronze clamps were often used.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">When concrete was employed it was faced either with blocks
                    of&nbsp;opus quadratum </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >(e.g.,</span><span class="font3"> the Servian&nbsp;wall along the Aventine) or
                    with&nbsp;opus incertum—small irregularly&nbsp;shaped blocks of tufa 3 to 6
                    inches&nbsp;across, with pointed ends driven&nbsp;into the concrete while it was
                    soft,&nbsp;and worked smooth on the face&nbsp;only (see fig. 3). Thirdly, in
                    the&nbsp;1st century b.c. opus reticulatum,@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>also of tufa, was
                    largely used alone ;&nbsp;after that it began to be mixed with&nbsp;brickwork.
                    It is very neat in appearance, and is often fitted with&nbsp;great care, though
                    it was generally&nbsp;covered with stucco. The so-called&nbsp;“house of Livia”
                    on the Palatine&nbsp;is a good example of the earlier&nbsp;sort, when the quoins
                    were made&nbsp;of small rectangular blocks of tufa.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">The palace of Caligula has it with quoins of brick facing. Though
                    in&nbsp;Rome opus reticulatum was always&nbsp;made of tufa, in the
                    neighbourhood</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">of the city it was sometimes of peperino or even lava, where
                    these materials were found on the spot.</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
            <p><span class="font3">Of concrete walls faced with burnt bricks no dated example 1
                    earlier than the middle of the 1st century n.c. is known. Thei&nbsp;Pantheon (27
                    b.c. ) is the most important early specimen of certain&nbsp;date. The bricks
                    used are always triangular in shape, so as to&nbsp;present a large surface on
                    the face with little expenditure of brick,&nbsp;and also to improve the bond
                    with the concrete behind (see fig. 4).&nbsp;Even party walls of small rooms,
                    only 7 inches thick, are not built&nbsp;solid, but have a concrete core faced
                    with brick triangles about&nbsp;3 inches long. Owing</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">to this method of forming the walls it was necessaι∙y to
                    support&nbsp;the facing until the&nbsp;concrete was set, which&nbsp;appears to
                    have been&nbsp;done with a λvooden&nbsp;framing covered with&nbsp;planks on the
                    inside.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">In some cases the planks were nailed outside the&nbsp;wooden
                    uprights, as was&nbsp;done with the unfaced concrete walls (see below), and then
                    a series&nbsp;of perpendicular grooves appear in the face of the brickwork.
                    Walls&nbsp;faced with opus reticulatum must have been supported
                    temporarily&nbsp;in the same way.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">The character of the brick facing is a great help towards
                    determining the date of Roman buildings ; it has been stated that this can be
                    done simply by measuring the number of brick courses that&nbsp;go to a foot,—the
                    more the bricks the earlier the work. This, however, is not the case. In early
                    work the bricks are thick and the&nbsp;joints thin, while in later times the
                    reverse is the case. Thus&nbsp;brickwork of the time of Severus and later
                    usually has more bricks&nbsp;to the foot than that of the Flavian period. The
                    following list&nbsp;gives a few characteristic specimens of different
                    dates.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">The length of the bricks as it appears on the face is no guide to
                    the date, owing to the fact that one or more of the sharp points&nbsp;of the
                    brick triangles were very frequently broken off before they&nbsp;were used.
                    Moreover, varieties both in quality of workmanship and&nbsp;size of the bricks
                    often occur in work of the same date ; a new gang&nbsp;of workmen oι<sup>,</sup>
                    a batch of bricks from a fresh </span><span class="font3"
                    style="font-style:italic;">figlina</span><span class="font3"> might
                    easily&nbsp;occasion this. In the remains of Nero’s Golden House
                    great&nbsp;varieties appear, and some of the walls in the inferior rooms
                    are&nbsp;faced with very irregular and careless brickwork.@@<sup>4</sup> Special
                    care&nbsp;and neatness were always employed in the rare cases when the
                    wall&nbsp;was not to be covered with stucco, which in the absence of
                    marble&nbsp;was usually spread over both inside and outside walls. All
                    these&nbsp;circumstances make great caution necessary in judging of dates
                    ;&nbsp;fortunately after the 1st century </span><span class="font1">A.D.,
                    </span><span class="font3">and in some cases even&nbsp;earlier, stamps impressed
                    on bricks, and especially on the largo&nbsp;tiles used for arches, give clearer
                    indications. The reason of tlιo&nbsp;almost universal use of smooth facings
                    either of opus reticulatum&nbsp;or of brick over concrete walls is a very
                    puzzling question ; for concrete itself forms an excellent ground for the stucco
                    coating or backing to the marble slabs, while the stucco adheres with
                    difficulty&nbsp;to a smooth facing, and is very liable to fall away. The
                    modern&nbsp;practice of raking out the joints to form a key was not
                    employed&nbsp;by the Romans, but before the mortar was hard they studded
                    the&nbsp;face of the wall with marble plugs and iron or bronze nails
                    driven&nbsp;into the joints, so as to give a hold for the stucco—a great
                    waste&nbsp;both of labour and material.@@<sup>5</sup> The quality of the mortar
                    varies&nbsp;according to its date : during the 1st and 2d centuries it is of
                    most&nbsp;remarkable hardness,—made of lime with a mixture of
                    coarse&nbsp;pozzolana of a bright red colour ; in the 3d century it began
                    to&nbsp;be inferior in quality ; and the pozzolana used under the
                    later&nbsp;empire is brown instead of red.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font3">Concrete was at first always made of lumps of tufa ; then
                    travertine, lava, broken bricks, and even marble were used, in fact all the
                    chips and fragments of the mason’s yard. Under the empire&nbsp;the concrete used
                    was of travertine or lava mostly for foundations,&nbsp;of tufa or broken bricks
                    for walls, and of tufa or pumice-stone (for&nbsp;the sake of lightness) for
                    vaults. Massive walls were cast in a</span></p></div><br clear="all" /><div>
