The countship of St Pol-sur-Ternoise in France (department of Pas-de-Calais), belonged in the 11th and 12th centuries to a family surnamed Candavène. Elizabeth, heiress of this house, carried the countship to her husband, Gaucher de Châtillon, in 1205. By the marriage of Mahaut de Châtillon with Guy VI. of Luxemburg, St Pol passed to the house of Luxemburg. It was in possession of Louis of Luxemburg, constable of France, who was beheaded in 1475. The constable’s property was confiscated by Louis XI., but was subsequently restored in 1488 to his granddaughters, Marie and Françoise of Luxemburg. Marie (d. 1542) was countess of St Pol, and married François de Bourbon, count of Vendôme. Their son, François de Bourbon, count of St Pol (1491-1545), was one of the most devoted and courageous generals of Francis I. Marie, daughter of the last-mentioned count, brought the countship of St Pol to the house of Orleans-Longueville. In 1705 Marie of Orleans sold it to Elizabeth of Lorraine-Lillebonne, widow of Louis de Melun, prince of Épinoy, and their daughter married the prince of Rohan-Soubise, who thus became count of St Pol.
