<p><span class="font0">after the first few years of life give off more CO<sub>2</sub> than females. When the external temperature is so low as&nbsp;to depress the body temperature, less CO<sub>2</sub> is given off ;&nbsp;if it is so high as to raise the body temperature, the&nbsp;CO<sub>2</sub> is increased. If, however, the surrounding medium&nbsp;is cooler than the body but not cold enough to lower the&nbsp;body temperature, more O is taken in, and more CO<sub>2</sub> is&nbsp;given out; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vice versa.</span><span class="font0"> Muscular exercise also increases&nbsp;considerably the CO<sub>2</sub> given off ; and more CO<sub>2</sub> is given off&nbsp;a short time after a meal than during fasting, especially&nbsp;when the meal includes substances rich in carbon. Speaking generally, alcohols, ethers, tea, &lt;fcc., diminish the CO<sub>2</sub> ;&nbsp;but the results are not constant. Again, while the&nbsp;number and depth of the respirations do not influence the&nbsp;formation of CO<sub>2</sub> in the body, they affect the removal of&nbsp;that which is already formed. Increased rate of respiration and increased depth of respiration both cause an&nbsp;absolute increase in the quantity of CO<sub>2</sub> expired, although&nbsp;with reference to the total amount of air which passes&nbsp;into and out of the lungs during such laboured breathing&nbsp;the CO., is relatively diminished. Lastly, when the atmospheric pressure is diminished, as in ballooning, respiration becomes difficult, CO<sub>2</sub> is imperfectly removed from&nbsp;the body, and the blood contains less O. When pressure&nbsp;is increased, respiration is easy and slow (2-4 per minute),&nbsp;the capacity of the lungs increases, the activities of the&nbsp;tissues are marked, and as a result of this more O is&nbsp;absorbed and more CO<sub>s</sub> is excreted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Blood in Respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having ascertained the nature and quantity of the materials exchanged in the lungs, we may now ask concerning the method of the exchange. There is no difficulty&nbsp;in understanding how the cold air introduced into the lungs&nbsp;is warmed and saturated with moisture by contact with&nbsp;the moist walls of the air passages and bronchi. As to&nbsp;the gaseous substances which appear in traces in the&nbsp;expired air nothing definite is known ; they may in part&nbsp;arise in the decomposition of the solid organic impurities&nbsp;of expired air, and may in part escape from the blood itself.&nbsp;The origin of the solid poisonous organic substances, which&nbsp;are of such vital interest from a sanitary point of view, is&nbsp;also a matter of great obscurity. Some portions of it&nbsp;doubtless consist of effete particles of tissue from the walls&nbsp;of the bronchial tubes and cavity of the mouth and&nbsp;nose; for example, epithelial scales may be discovered&nbsp;in the condensed moisture of the air expired into an&nbsp;ice-cold globe, and so also may the organized bacilli of&nbsp;tubercle when the subject of experiment happens to be&nbsp;phthisical. Other portions may spring directly from the&nbsp;blood. The chief inquiry, however, centres about the&nbsp;origin of the carbon dioxide and the absorption of the&nbsp;oxygen, for the understanding of which a knowledge of&nbsp;the blood is necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Blood.—</span><span class="font0">This, as it circulates in the vessels of man and vertebrates generally, is a viscous and to the naked&nbsp;eye homogeneous liquid of red colour,—the blood of the&nbsp;pulmonary veins, of the left side of the heart, and of the&nbsp;systemic arteries being normally of a bright scarlet hue,&nbsp;and the blood of the right side of the heart, of the&nbsp;systemic veins, and of the pulmonary artery being of a&nbsp;brownish-red colour. In other words the blood enters the&nbsp;capillaries of the lungs of a brownish-red colour, and&nbsp;leaves them bright scarlet in hue ; it enters the general&nbsp;capillaries of the body as a bright scarlet fiuid and leaves&nbsp;them as a brownish-red fluid. Although homogeneous to&nbsp;the naked eye, the blood is found on microscopic examination to consist of a colourless fluid, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">liquor sanguinis&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plasma,</span><span class="font0"> holding in suspension large numbers of solid&nbsp;bodies, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">corpuscles</span><span class="font0"> of the blood; the more numerous of&nbsp;these are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">red,</span><span class="font0"> the others are colourless and are commonly&nbsp;spoken of as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">white.</span><span class="font0"> The specific gravity of blood probably&nbsp;varies between 1045 and 1075. Fresh blood is feebly&nbsp;alkaline in reaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When blood is shed it remains for a minute or two as fiuid as it is in the blood-vessels ; but in 2-6 minutes it&nbsp;begins to pass into the state of a soft red jelly, which&nbsp;gradually acquires greater consistence, and by the contraction of one of its constituents at length expresses a fluid ;&nbsp;the contracted jelly is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">clot,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">crassameηtum</span><span class="font0"> ; the&nbsp;expressed fluid is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">serum</span><span class="font0"> ; and the whole process is&nbsp;denominated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coagulation.</span><span class="font0"> Contraction of the clot may go&nbsp;on for 10-48 hours. This process of coagulation is due&nbsp;to the separation from the plasma of a body called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fibrin,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which entangles in its meshes the corpuscles of the blood.&nbsp;When coagulation is delayed for several minutes (as it&nbsp;always is in horse’s blood, and as it usually is in the blood&nbsp;of men suffering from inflammatory diseases), the blood&nbsp;corpuscles, being specifically heavier than the plasma, have&nbsp;time to subside a little way before coagulation commences.&nbsp;Hence the uppermost layers of such blood become nearly&nbsp;free from coloured corpuscles ; and subsequently, when the&nbsp;blood coagulates, the clot exhibits the phenomenon of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bujky coat,—</span><span class="font0">that is, the upper part of the clot is of a&nbsp;yellowish colour. If, instead of allowing blood to coagulate&nbsp;undisturbed, it be stirred or whipped with twigs, the fibrin&nbsp;does not entangle the corpuscles but separates as a stringy&nbsp;mass which adheres to the twigs ; the corpuscles remain&nbsp;in the serum and constitute </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">defibriηated blood.</span><span class="font0"> Coagulation is promoted (a) by exposure to a temperature slightly&nbsp;higher than that of the living body ; (δ) by contact with&nbsp;foreign matter ; (c) by the addition of minute quantities&nbsp;of common salt or other neutral salts. It is delayed or&nbsp;suspended (a) by exposure to an ice-cold temperature ; (6)&nbsp;by contact with the living blood-vessels ; (c) by the addition of a sufficient quantity of sodium chloride, sodium&nbsp;sulphate, or some other neutral salts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reviewing all the facts which have been ascertained respecting coagulation, it would appear that the process is&nbsp;dependent upon the presence in the liquor sanguinis of a&nbsp;proteid body called fibrinogen, which under favourable&nbsp;circumstances undergoes conversion, or perhaps decomposition, into fibrin. This conversion, when it occurs outside&nbsp;the body, appears to be connected with the action of a&nbsp;ferment produced in the colourless corpuscles, and probably only set free when they break down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The red corpuscles of man and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mammalia</span><span class="font0"> generally, except the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Camelidæ,</span><span class="font0"> are biconcave disks, possessing neither skin nor nucleus or interior body. In birds,&nbsp;reptiles, and most fishes they are nucleated, elliptical, and&nbsp;biconvex. In the camel the red corpuscles are oval. The&nbsp;average diameter of the disk in man is ∙<sub>5</sub>-<sub>i</sub>⅛<sub>σ</sub> inch and the&nbsp;thickness about&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i<sup>n</sup>θh∙</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The substance of which the red disks is composed is elastic ; the disks may therefore be squeezed through fine&nbsp;chinks smaller than their own diameter and may afterwards regain their original shape. When in the bloodvessels the red corpuscles are hurried along indiscrimately&nbsp;in the blood current, but when the blood stands the red&nbsp;corpuscles cling together in rows like piles of coin, which&nbsp;are technically called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rouleaux·,</span><span class="font0"> this is a physical,phenomenon entirely due to the shape of the corpuscles. The&nbsp;white or colourless corpuscles are globular masses of&nbsp;granular protoplasm, provided with one or more interior&nbsp;bodies called nuclei, but destitute of a skin. They have&nbsp;the power of independent movement, which the red cells&nbsp;have not, resembling in this respect the amoeba. They&nbsp;can send out processes, change their outline, and move&nbsp;from place to place by laying hold on resistent objects by&nbsp;means of a projected process and dragging their bodies</span></p>
