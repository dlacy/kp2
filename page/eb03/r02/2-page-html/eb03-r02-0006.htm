<p><span class="font1">with ſreſh fury; in which the Rhodians made a moſt noble defence, conſidering their ſmall number, and that&nbsp;they had now only the barbican or falſe bray of the&nbsp;baſtion of Spain left to defend themſelves, and once&nbsp;more repulſed the enemy: at which the ſultan was ſo&nbsp;enraged, that he reſolved to overpower them by numbers on the next day; which was, after a ſtout defence,&nbsp;ſo effectually done, that they were forced to abandon&nbsp;that outwork, and retire into the city. In the meanwhile, the burghers, who had but a day or two before&nbsp;raiſed a freſh uproar againſt the grand-maſter, under pretence that he was going to give them up a prey to an&nbsp;infidel who regarded neither oaths nor ſolemn treaties,&nbsp;perceiving their own danger, came now to deſire him&nbsp;to renew the negociations, and only begged the liberty of ſending one of their deputies along with his,&nbsp;to ſecure their intereſts in the capitulation. He readily&nbsp;conſented to it; but gave them a charge to ſhow the&nbsp;baſhaw Achmed the treaty formerly concluded between&nbsp;Bajazet and his predeceſſor d’Aubuſſon, in which the&nbsp;former had entailed a dreadful curſe on any of his ſuc-ceſſors that ſhould infringe it. This was done, in hopes&nbsp;that the ſhowing it to his maſter, who valued himſelf ſo&nbsp;much upon his ſtrict obſervance of his law, might produce ſome qualm in him which might lengthen the&nbsp;agreement, for they were ſtill as much in hopes of a&nbsp;ſuccour from Europe as he was in fear of it; but to&nbsp;their great ſurpriſe, Achmed had no ſooner peruſed than&nbsp;he tore it all in pieces, trampled it under his feet, and&nbsp;in a rage ordered them to be gone. The grand-maſter&nbsp;found no other reſource than to fend them back to him&nbsp;the next day; when that miniſter, who knew his matter’s&nbsp;impatience to have the affair concluded, quickly agreed&nbsp;with them upon the terms, which were in ſubſtance as&nbsp;follow:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I. That the churches ſhould not be profaned. 2. That the inhabitants ſhould not be forced to part with their&nbsp;children to be made janiſſaries. 3. That they ſhould&nbsp;enjoy the free exerciſe of their religion. 4. That they&nbsp;ſhould be free from taxes during five years. 5. That&nbsp;thoſe who had a mind to leave the iſland ſhould have&nbsp;free leave to do ſo. 6. That iſ the grand-maſter and&nbsp;his knights had not a ſufficient number of veſſels to&nbsp;tranſport themſelves and their effects into Candia, the&nbsp;ſultan ſhould ſupply that defect. 7. That they ſhould&nbsp;have 12 days allowed them, from the ſigning of the articles, to lend all their effects on board. 8. That they&nbsp;ſhould have the liberty of carrying away their relics,&nbsp;chalices, and other ſacred utenſils belonging to the great&nbsp;church of St John, together with all their ornaments&nbsp;and other effects. 9. That they ſhould likewiſe carry&nbsp;with them all the artillery with which they were wont&nbsp;to arm the galleys of the order- 10. That the iſlands&nbsp;belonging to it, together with the caſtle of St Peter,&nbsp;ſhould be delivered up to the Turks. 11. That, for&nbsp;the more eaſy execution of theſe articles, the Turkiſh&nbsp;army ſhould be removed at ſome miles diſtance from the&nbsp;capital. 12.That the aga of the janiſſaries, at the head&nbsp;of 4000 of his men, ſhould be allowed to go and take&nbsp;poſſeſſion of the place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From this time the iſland of Rhodes has been ſub-ject to the Turks ; and, like other countries ſubject to that tyrannical yoke, has loſt its former importance.&nbsp;The air is good, and the foil fertile, but ill cultivated.&nbsp;The capital is ſurrounded with triple walls and double&nbsp;ditches, and is looked upon to be impregnable. </span><span class="font0">It </span><span class="font1">is&nbsp;inhabited by Turks and Jews; the Chi iſtians being obliged to occupy the ſuburbs, as not being allowed to&nbsp;ſtay in the town during the night. The town is ſitua-ted in E. Long. 28. 25. N. Lat. 36. 54.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHODIOLA, rose-wort, in botany: A genus of the octandria order, belonging to the diœcia claſs of&nbsp;plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the&nbsp;13th order, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Succulentœ.</span><span class="font1"> The male calyx is quadripartite ; the corolla tetrapetalous. The female calyx is&nbsp;quadripartite, and there is no corolla ; the nectaria are&nbsp;four; the piſtils four ; and there are four polyſpermous&nbsp;capſules. There are two ſpecies, the roſea and the minor : the firſt grows naturally in the clefts of the rocks&nbsp;and rugged mountains of Wales, Yorkſhire, and Weſt-moreland. It has a very thick fleſhy root, which when&nbsp;cut or bruiſed fends out an odour like roſes. It has&nbsp;thick ſucculent ſtalks, like thoſe of orpine, about nine&nbsp;inches long, cloſely garniſhed with thick ſucculent leaves&nbsp;indented at the top. The ſtalk is terminated by a chι-ſter of yellowiſh herbaceous flowers, which have an&nbsp;agreeable ſcent, but are of ſhort continuance. The ſe-cond ſort is a native of the Alps, and has purpliſh&nbsp;flowers which come out later than the former ; it is al-ſo of a ſmaller ſize. Both ſpecies are eaſily propagated&nbsp;by parting their roots ; and require a ſhady ſituation,&nbsp;and dry undunged foil. The fragrance of the firſt&nbsp;ſpecies, however, is greatly diminiſhed by cultivation.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RHODODENDRON, dwarf rose-bay, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 18th order, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bicornes.</span><span class="font1"> The calyx is quinquepartite ; the corolla funnel-ſhaped ; the&nbsp;ſtamina declining ; the capſule quinquelocular. There&nbsp;are ſeven ſpecies : the moſt remarkable of which are,&nbsp;I. The hirſutum, with naked hairy leaves, grows naturally on the Alps and ſeveral mountains of Italy. It&nbsp;is a low ſhrub, which ſeldom riſes two feet high, lending out many ligneous branches covered with a light-brown bark, garniſhed cloſely with oval ſpear-ſhaped&nbsp;leaves, fitting pretty cloſe to the branches. They are&nbsp;entire, having a great number of fine iron-coloured hairs&nbsp;on their edges and underſide. The flowers are produced in bunches at the end of the branches in May, having one funnel-ſhaped petal cut into five obtuſe ſeg-ments, and of a pale-red colour. They make a good&nbsp;ſhow, and are ſucceeded by oval capſules, containing&nbsp;ripe ſeeds in Auguſt. 2. The ferrugineum, with ſmooth&nbsp;leaves, hairy on their underſide, is a native of the Alps&nbsp;and Apennines. It riſes with a ſhrubby ſtalk near&nbsp;three feet high, ſending out many irregular branches&nbsp;covered with a purpliſh bark, and cloſely garniſhed with&nbsp;ſmooth ſpear-ſhaped entire leaves, whoſe borders are re-flexed backward ; the upper ſide is of a light lucid&nbsp;green, their under ſide of an iron colour. The flowers&nbsp;are produced at the ends of the branches, are funnel-ſhaped, cut into five ſegments, and of a pale roſe colour.&nbsp;Theſe plants are propagated by ſeeds ; but, being natives of barren rocky foils and cold ſituations, they do&nbsp;not thrive in gardens, and for want of their uſual covering of ſnow in the winter are often killed by froſt in&nbsp;this country. 3. The chamaeciſtus, or ciliated-leaved&nbsp;dwarf roſe-bay, is a low deciduous ſhrub, native of&nbsp;Mount Baldus, and near Saltzburg, in Germany. It</span></p>
