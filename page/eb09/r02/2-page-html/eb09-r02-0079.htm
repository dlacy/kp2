<p><span class="font1">In chronic rheumatism the remedies are innumerable. This form of the disease is less under the power of&nbsp;medicinal agents than the acute, although much may be&nbsp;done to alleviate the suffering produced by it as well as to&nbsp;limit its extension. Salicin and the salicylates so useful in&nbsp;acute rheumatism are not found as a rule to be of much&nbsp;service, while on the other hand alkalis in combination with&nbsp;sulphur, iodine, arsenic, and tonics, such as iron, quinine,&nbsp;cod-liver oil, ιfec., are the most serviceable remedies. Turpentine is also recommended. Friction of the affected parts&nbsp;with stimulating or soothing liniments, counter-irritation&nbsp;with blisters, iodine, or the button cautery are useful local&nbsp;applications, as is also galvanism. Hot baths or Turkish&nbsp;baths may occasionally be used with advantage. The&nbsp;mineral waters and baths of various well-known resorts are&nbsp;of undoubted benefit, especially those of Buxton, Bath,&nbsp;Strathpeffer, or Harrogate in Great Britain, or those of Aix-les-Bains, Wiesbaden, Homburg, Ems, Wildbad, Aix-la-Chapelle, and many others on the Continent. Changes to&nbsp;warmer climates during the colder season where practicable&nbsp;are also to be recommended, as well as every other measure&nbsp;calculated to improve the general health.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rheumatoid Arthritis.—This term (syn. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chronic rheumatic arthritis, arthritis deformans)</span><span class="font1"> is employed to designate a chronic inflammatory affection of joints, involving specially the synovial membranes and articular cartilages,&nbsp;of slow development and progressive character, resulting in&nbsp;stiffening and deformity of the parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This disease is held by some to partake of the nature of both rheumatism and gout (hence occasionally termed&nbsp;rheumatic gout) ; others regard it as simply a variety of&nbsp;chronic rheumatism ; while in the opinion of several&nbsp;eminent authorities it is an independent constitutional&nbsp;affection occurring in persons with a strumous or tubercular&nbsp;tendency. It does not appear to be hereditary. It is&nbsp;more common in women than in men, and occurs at all&nbsp;ages. It is closely connected with conditions of ill health ;&nbsp;and hence its frequent occurrence among those whose blood&nbsp;is impoverished by insufficient food, by hardship, or by any&nbsp;drain upon the system. It occasionally follows an attack&nbsp;of acute rheumatism ; hence the supposed connexion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The disease in most cases is slowly developed, and shows itself first by pain and swelling in one joint (knee, wrist,&nbsp;finger, &amp;c.), which soon subside and may remain absent for&nbsp;a considerable time. Sooner or later, however, another&nbsp;attack occurs either in the joint formerly affected or in&nbsp;some other, and it is noticed that the affected articulation&nbsp;does not now regain its normal size but remains somewhat&nbsp;swollen. The attacks recur with increasing frequency,&nbsp;gradually involving more joints, until, in course of time (for&nbsp;its progress is very chronic), scarcely an articulation in&nbsp;the body is free from the disease. Thickening of the&nbsp;textures, with stiffness, is the result, and often considerable&nbsp;deformity from the joints being fixed in certain positions.&nbsp;The muscles of the affected limbs undergo atrophy and&nbsp;contrast strikingly with the abnormally enlarged joints.&nbsp;Painful inflammatory attacks often occur in the affected&nbsp;joints, and the patient is much reduced in strength by the&nbsp;constant irritation of the disease. In the young the hands&nbsp;are very liable to suffer, and the disease gradually extends&nbsp;to involve other parts ; while in old persons it is apt to&nbsp;fasten upon one joint, often the hip, and is not so apt to&nbsp;spread. The chief changes in the joints are (1) in the&nbsp;synovial membrane, which is at first simply inflamed and&nbsp;contains fluid, but ultimately becomes much thickened, and&nbsp;(2) in the articular cartilage, which tends to split up and&nbsp;become gradually absorbed, leaving the articular ends of&nbsp;the bone exposed. The osseous surfaces thus brought into</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">contact become hard and polished by friction. These changes and others affecting the ligaments are apt to&nbsp;produce partial dislocation as well as stiffening of the joint,&nbsp;rendering it deformed and useless. This disease often&nbsp;lasts for many years, sometimes continuing for a lengthened&nbsp;period without much change, but tending gradually to&nbsp;progress and to render the patient more and more helpless.&nbsp;It is not attended with the complications of rheumatism,&nbsp;and is not inconsistent with long life, but its weakening&nbsp;effects upon the system and the ill health with which it is&nbsp;usually associated render the subject of it more liable to&nbsp;the inroads of other diseases. Rheumatoid arthritis is less&nbsp;amenable to treatment than rheumatism, the remedies for&nbsp;which are not found to be of much value in this disease.&nbsp;Most success is obtained if it is recognized early and&nbsp;measures are taken to strengthen the patient’s general&nbsp;health. The best medicinal agents are iron, quinine, cod-liver oil, arsenic. Chalybeate mineral waters, such as those&nbsp;of Schwalbach, Spa, Pyrmont, &lt;fcc., are often of service.&nbsp;Locally blisters or milder counter-irritation to the affected&nbsp;joints, as well as the employment of galvanism, may be&nbsp;advantageously resorted to.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(j. o.

<p><span class="font1">RHEYDT, a manufacturing town of Rhenish Prussia, is situated on the Niers, 14 miles to the west of Düsseldorf. The principal products of its numerous factories&nbsp;are silk, cotton, woollen, and mixed fabrics, iron goods,&nbsp;machinery, lamp wicks, and roofing pasteboard. Dyeing&nbsp;and finishing are also carried on. The most prominent&nbsp;buildings are the old parish church and a new one erected&nbsp;in 1866. Rheydt is an ancient place, but its industrial&nbsp;importance is of very recent growth. At the beginning&nbsp;of the present century it did not contain more than 2000 to&nbsp;3000 inhabitants, whereas in 1880 the population of the&nbsp;municipal commune was 19,087, two-thirds of whom were&nbsp;Protestants.</span></p>

Its general course is&nbsp;north-north west, but it makes numerous deflexions and&nbsp;at one point is found running in a diametrically opposite&nbsp;direction. About 250 miles of its length are in Switzerland, 450 in Germany, and 100 in Holland; but the&nbsp;German half is in every respect so much the more important that it is no misnomer to call the Rhine a German&nbsp;river, even if the word German be confined to its&nbsp;modern political signification. The name Rhine, which&nbsp;is apparently of Celtic origin, is of uncertain import, but&nbsp;has been supposed to mean “flowing” or “clear.” The&nbsp;sources of the Rhine are found in the Swiss canton of&nbsp;Grisons, where the drainage of at least 150 glaciers unites&nbsp;to form its headwaters. Among these streams, all of&nbsp;which are termed Rhin in the Ladine dialect of the&nbsp;district, two are generally recognized as the main sources&nbsp;of the river, viz., the Vorder Rhein and the Hinter Rhein.&nbsp;The chief feeder of the former rises in the small Lake of&nbsp;Toma, situated on the south-east slope of the St Gotthard,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2&nbsp;</sup>at a height of 7690 feet above the sea and at no great&nbsp;distance from the source of the Rhone, which rises on the&nbsp;west side of the same mountain mass.
