<p><span class="font0">The local authorities proceeded to carry this out with a zeal due to long suffering, and the ruined medieval châteaus of France&nbsp;still bear witness to the action of Richelieu. Still there was no&nbsp;serious opposition to the new minister. The first serious conspiracy took place in 1626, the king’s brother, Gaston of Orleans,&nbsp;being the centre of it. His governor, Marshal DOrnano, was&nbsp;arrested by Richelieu’s orders, and then his confidant, Henri&nbsp;de Talleyrand, marquis de Chalais and Vendôme, the natural&nbsp;sons of Henry IV. Chalais was executed and the marshal&nbsp;died in prison. The overthrow of the Huguenots in 1629 made&nbsp;Richelieu’s position seemingly unassailable, but the next year&nbsp;it received its severest test. Marie de’ Medici had turned&nbsp;against her “ ungrateful ” minister with a hatred intensified,&nbsp;it is said, by unrequited passion. In September 1630, while&nbsp;Louis XIII. was very ill at Lyons, the two queens, Marie and&nbsp;Anne of Austria, reconciled for the time, won the king’s promise&nbsp;to dismiss Richelieu. He postponed the date until peace should&nbsp;be made with Spain. When the news came of the truce of&nbsp;Regensburg Marie claimed the fulfilment of the promise. On&nbsp;the 10th of November 1630 the king went to his mother’s apartments at the Luxembourg palace. Orders were given that no&nbsp;one should be allowed to disturb their interview, but Richelieu&nbsp;entered by the unguarded chapel door. When Marie had&nbsp;recovered breath from such audacity she proceeded to attack&nbsp;him in the strongest terms, declaring that the king must choose&nbsp;between him or her. Richelieu left the presence feeling that all&nbsp;was lost. The king gave a sign of yielding, appointing the&nbsp;brother of Marillac, Marie’s counsellor, to the command of the&nbsp;army in Italy. But before taking further steps he retired to&nbsp;Versailles, then a hunting lodge, and there, listening to two of&nbsp;Richelieu’s friends, Claude de Saint-Simon, father of the memoir&nbsp;writer, and Cardinal La Valette, sent for Richelieu in the evening,&nbsp;and while the salons of the Luxembourg were full of expectant&nbsp;courtiers the king was reassuring the cardinal of his continued&nbsp;favour and support. The “ Day of Dupes,” as this famous day&nbsp;was called, was the only time that Louis took so much as a step&nbsp;toward the dismissal of a minister who was personally distasteful&nbsp;to him but who was indispensable. The queen-mother followed&nbsp;the king and cardinal to Compiègne, but as she refused to be&nbsp;reconciled with Richelieu she was left there alone and forbidden&nbsp;to return to Paris. The next summer she fled across the&nbsp;frontiers into the Netherlands, and Richelieu was made a duke.&nbsp;Then Gaston of Orleans, who had fled to Lorraine, came back&nbsp;with a small troop to head a rebellion to free the king and&nbsp;country from “ the tyrant.” The only great noble who rose&nbsp;was Henri, duc de Montmorenci, governor of Languedoc, and&nbsp;his defeat at Castelnaudary on the ist of September 1632 was&nbsp;followed by his speedy trial by the parlement of Toulouse, and&nbsp;by his execution. Richelieu had sent to the block the first&nbsp;noble of France, the last of a family illustrious for seven centuries,&nbsp;the feudal head of the nobility of Languedoc; then, unmoved&nbsp;by threats or entreaties, inexorable as fate itself, he cowed all&nbsp;opposition by his relentless vengeance. He knew no mercy.&nbsp;The only other conspiracy against him which amounted to more&nbsp;than intrigue was that of Cinq Mars in 1642, at the close of his&nbsp;life. This vain young favourite of the king was treated as though&nbsp;he were really a formidable traitor, and his friend, De Thou, son&nbsp;of the historian, whose sole guilt was not to have revealed the&nbsp;plot, was placed in a boat behind the stately barge of the cardinal&nbsp;and thus conveyed up the Rhone to his trial and death at&nbsp;Lyons. The voyage was symbolical of Richelieu’s whole pitiless&nbsp;career.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Richelieu’s foreign policy was as inflexible as his home policy. To humble the Habsburgs he aided the Protestant princes of&nbsp;Germany against the emperor, in spite of the strong opposition&nbsp;of the disappointed Catholic party in France, which had looked&nbsp;to the cardinal as a champion of the faith. The year of&nbsp;Richelieu’s triumph over the Huguenots (1629) was also that of&nbsp;the Emperor Ferdinand’s triumph in Germany, marked by the&nbsp;Edict of Restitution, and France was threatened by a united&nbsp;Germany. Richelieu, however, turned against the Habsburgs&nbsp;young Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden, paying him a subsidy of a&nbsp;million livres a year by the treaty of Barwald of the 23rd of&nbsp;January 1631. The dismissal of Wallenstein, which is often&nbsp;attributed to the work of Father Joseph, Richelieu’s envoy to&nbsp;the diet of Regensburg in July and August of 1630, was due&nbsp;rather to the fears of the electors themselves, but it was of&nbsp;double value to Richelieu when his Swedish ally marched south.&nbsp;After the treaty of Prague, in May 1635, by which the emperor&nbsp;was reconciled with most of the German princes, Richelieu was&nbsp;finally obliged to declare war, and, concluding a treaty of offensive&nbsp;alliance at Compiègne with Oxenstierna, and in October one at&nbsp;St Germain-en-Laye with Bernard of Saxe-Weimar, he proceeded&nbsp;himself against Spain, both in Italy and in the Netherlands.&nbsp;The war opened disastrously for the French, but by 1642, when&nbsp;Richelieu died, his armies—risen from 12,000 men in 1621 to&nbsp;150,000 in 1638—had conquered Roussillon from Spain; they&nbsp;held Catalonia, which had revolted from Philip IV. of Spain, and&nbsp;had taken Turin and forced Savoy to allow French troops on&nbsp;the borders of the Milanese. In Germany Torstensson was.&nbsp;sweeping the imperialist forces before him through Silesia and&nbsp;Moravia. The lines of the treaty of Westphalia, six years later,&nbsp;were already laid down by Richelieu; and its epochal importance in European history is a measure of the genius who threw&nbsp;the balance of power from Habsburg to Bourbon. The predominance of Louis XIV. in European politics was largely due&nbsp;to the statesman who prepared France for his absolutism at&nbsp;home.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The magnitude of Richelieu’s achievement grows when one considers his relations with the king. Louis XIII. cordially&nbsp;disliked him, and would gladly have got rid of him if he had&nbsp;not been able to convince the king of the wisdom of everything&nbsp;he did. Thus obliged to assume the unpleasant role of tutor&nbsp;when delicate flattery was often most needful, the minister&nbsp;lectured and cajoled his master, always, until towards the&nbsp;last, giving credit to the king for his own successes, and overawing opposition by his imperious presence even when Louis&nbsp;was dabbling in plots against him (as in the case of Cinq Mars)&nbsp;behind his back. The king’s consciousness of his weakness&nbsp;was combined with a sense of duty, and it was upon these two-chords that Richelieu played. Besides, he was eternally on&nbsp;the alert. Spies in every salon in Paris and every court in&nbsp;Europe kept the grim courtier informed of every change in his&nbsp;master’s disposition and every intrigue against himself. The&nbsp;piquant comments of his platonic friend, Mademoiselle de&nbsp;Hautefort, upon Richelieu were relished by the king until he&nbsp;was informed of others said to have been made hy her upon&nbsp;himself. Then it was easy to supplant her with another&nbsp;favourite, Mademoiselle de Lafayette. When this devout&nbsp;maiden began to denounce the ungodly cardinal who was&nbsp;allied with heretics, her confessor—in Richelieu’s service—&nbsp;succeeded in inducing her to become a nun. Father Caussin,&nbsp;the king’s confessor, ventured the same comments, and Louis&nbsp;plotted like a schoolboy to turn his devotions into secret&nbsp;criticisms of state policies. Caussin was sent into Brittany,&nbsp;and the judicious and learned Jesuit, Jacques Sirmond, who&nbsp;succeeded him, kept clear of politics. Such was the atmosphere&nbsp;of the court in which Richelieu had to maintain his authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His own personality was his strongest ally. The king himself quailed before that stern, august presence. His pale,,&nbsp;drawn face was set with his iron will. His frame was sickly&nbsp;and wasted with disease, yet when clad in his red cardinal’s,&nbsp;robes, his stately carriage and confident bearing gave him the&nbsp;air of a prince. His courage was mingled with a mean sort&nbsp;of cunning, and his ambition loved the outward trappings of&nbsp;power as well as its reality; yet he never swerved from his&nbsp;policy in order to win approbation, and the king knew that&nbsp;his one motive in public affairs was the welfare of the realm&nbsp;—that his religion, in short, was “ reason of state.” A clear&nbsp;conscience, not less than a sense of his own superiority toothers at the court of Louis XIII., made the cardinal haughtily&nbsp;assert his ascendancy, and the king shared his belief in both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No courtier was ever more assertive of his prerogatives. He claimed precedence over even princes of the blood, and one</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
