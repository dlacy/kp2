<p><span class="font1">called for. Before the end of the author’s life the book had reached its fourteenth edition ; and in the opinion&nbsp;of some it remains Robertson’s greatest work. It soon&nbsp;brought him other rewards than literary fame. In 1759&nbsp;he was appointed chaplain of Stirling Castle, in 1761 one&nbsp;of His Majesty’s chaplains in ordinary, and in 1762 he&nbsp;was chosen principal of the university of Edinburgh. Two&nbsp;years later the office of king’s historiographer was revived&nbsp;in his favour with a salary of £200 a year. His income&nbsp;greatly surpassed the revenue of any Presbyterian minister&nbsp;before him and at least equalled that of some of the bishops&nbsp;when Episcopacy was established in Scotland. It is the&nbsp;more surprising therefore that this moment of exceptional&nbsp;prosperity should have been chosen by some of his most&nbsp;valued friends to advise him to forsake the Scottish for the&nbsp;English Church and try for preferment south of the Tweed ;&nbsp;and the surprise becomes wonder when we learn that those&nbsp;friends were Sir Gilbert Elliot and David Hume. The&nbsp;imprudence, to say nothing of the questionable morality,&nbsp;of such a step would seem too glaring to allow of its&nbsp;recommendation by any honourable well-wishers. Perhaps&nbsp;no man was more fitted than Robertson to measure and&nbsp;reject such injudicious advice, and he probably never gave&nbsp;the matter a second thought. He remained at home&nbsp;among his own people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rest of Robertson’s life was uneventful to a degree even surpassing the proverbial uneventfulness of the lives&nbsp;of scholars. He was casting about for another historical&nbsp;subject in the very year in which his first w<sup>τ</sup>ork appeared,&nbsp;and he was wont to consult his friends on the choice of a&nbsp;period with a naïveté which shows how little the arduousness of historical research was then understood. Hume&nbsp;advised him to -write a history of Greece or else lives in&nbsp;the manner of Plutarch. Dr John Blair urged him to&nbsp;write a complete history of England, while Horace Walpole suggested a history of learning. It must be recorded&nbsp;to Robertson’s credit that he showed a preference from&nbsp;the first for the subject which he ultimately selected, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles the Fifth.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">He took uncommon pains with the work and devoted to&nbsp;it ten consecutive years of labour. It appeared in three&nbsp;volumes quaιto in 1769. In 1777 he published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History&nbsp;of America</span><span class="font1"> and in 1791 his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Disquisition concerning the&nbsp;Knowledge which the Ancients had of India,</span><span class="font1"> which concluded&nbsp;his historical labours and appeared only two years before&nbsp;his death, which occurred near Edinburgh on the 11th&nbsp;June 1793. His fame had long been European, and he&nbsp;left no rival in the field of historical composition save&nbsp;Gibbon alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For an adequate appreciation of Robertson’s position in British literature, and more especially of his rank as an&nbsp;historian, we have to consider the country and the age in&nbsp;which he was born and his own personal qualities and&nbsp;limits.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Considering the small size and poverty of the country, Scotland had made a more than creditable figure in literature in the great age of the Reformation and the Renaissance. Its scholars, civilians, and professors of logic and&nbsp;philosophy were welcomed wherever learning flourished,&nbsp;except, perhaps, in England. All Europe could not show&nbsp;a more brilliant writer and publicist than Buchanan, and&nbsp;“ the best romance that ever was written ” (the words are&nbsp;Cowper’s) was produced by a Scottish contemporary of&nbsp;Shakespeare, viz., the once famous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Argeηis</span><span class="font1"> of John Barclay.&nbsp;But the early triumphs of Scottish genius were all won in&nbsp;a foreign if familiar idiom, the common language of the&nbsp;learned ; and when Latin retreated before the growing&nbsp;importance of modern tongues the Scots had no literary&nbsp;vernacular on which to fall back. For a century and a&nbsp;half (1600-1750) a Scottish writer to be read was forced to&nbsp;use a foreign language,—Latin, English, and even occasionally French. As Burton</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> has well remarked, this alone&nbsp;was sufficient to account in a large measure for the literary&nbsp;barrenness of the country. There was unquestionably&nbsp;another cause at work,—the fervent religious zeal with&nbsp;which the principles of the Reformation had been embraced : neither science, literature, nor art could obtain&nbsp;much attention from men who regarded them all as “ deceitful vanities,” leading the mind away from the one thing&nbsp;needful. In a small and sparsely peopled country, without wealth, commerce, or even politics in the larger sense,&nbsp;theology became a too absorbing and unique mental stimulus. This was, we may say, proved by the fact that as&nbsp;soon as the union with England opened a wider scope for&nbsp;Scottish energy and enterprise the theological temperature&nbsp;immediately fell,—a change witnessed with natural alarm&nbsp;by the more zealous clergy. “ The rise of our too great&nbsp;fondness for trade,” writes the Rev. Robert Wodrow in&nbsp;1709, “to the neglect of our more valuable interests, I&nbsp;humbly think, will be written on our judgment” (Buckle,&nbsp;vol. ii. p. 301). The growth of wealth stimulated the&nbsp;growth of the other great factor of civilization, that of&nbsp;knowledge, and by the middle of the 18th century, just&nbsp;at the time when Robertson was planning his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of&nbsp;Scotland,</span><span class="font1"> a wide spirit of inquiry was abroad. Scottish&nbsp;intellect had risen from the tomb in which it had lain&nbsp;entranced for more than a hundred years. The Scottish&nbsp;contribution to British literature in the last half of the&nbsp;century is distinctly superior to that produced in the&nbsp;southern portion of the island. In philosophy and political&nbsp;and economic science the balance is immensely in favour&nbsp;of Scotland. Robertson was therefore no inexplicable&nbsp;prodigy—an “obscure Scotch parson” writing “like a&nbsp;minister of state,” as it pleased Walpole and the London&nbsp;fops to regard him. He lived in a society far more propitious to high literary work than could be found in London&nbsp;or the English universities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The connexion between philosophy and history is closer than appears at first sight. The study of man and his&nbsp;faculties, even ontological speculations as to the nature&nbsp;and origin of the universe, lead by a logical sequence to a&nbsp;consideration of human evolution in time, that is, to&nbsp;history. The coincidence of philosophical speculation&nbsp;with historical achievement so repeatedly manifested cannot be accidental. The topic cannot be developed here ;&nbsp;but from the days of the Attic historians, who lived in&nbsp;an atmosphere electric with speculation, to the Hegelian&nbsp;historical school of Germany, the higher planes of history&nbsp;are found in near proximity to loftier peaks of philosophy.&nbsp;Hume, wonderful in all things, was perhaps most wonderful in this, that in him the two characters of the philosopher and the historian were completely united. He did&nbsp;not only, like Kant and Hegel, speculate about history ;&nbsp;he wrote it. Again, we must admire the peculiar fortune&nbsp;of Robertson : he lived during many years in close contact&nbsp;and intimacy with the greatest philosophic genius of his&nbsp;age, perhaps of modern times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the three great British historians of the 18th century two were Scotsmen. The exact place of Robertson with&nbsp;regard to his two friends Hume and Gibbon, and to such&nbsp;historians as the rest of Europe had to offer, presents a&nbsp;question of some nicety, because it is complicated by&nbsp;extraneous considerations, so to speak, which should not&nbsp;weigh in an abstract estimate, but cannot be excluded in&nbsp;a concrete and practical one. If we regard only Robertson’s potential historic power, the question is not so much&nbsp;whether he was equal to either of his two friends as&nbsp;whether he was not superior to both.
