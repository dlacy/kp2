General wurmſer reſuſed to accept of it upon theſe terms, inſiſting upon an abfolute ſurren-der to his Imperial Majeſty. In conſequence oſ the delay occaſioned by diſagreement, the negociation was diſcovered, and the citizens of Straſhourg engaged in the plot wererſeized by St Juſt and Lebas, commiffion-ers from the ^convention, and brought to the ſcaffold. Prodigious efforts were now made by tbe French to recover their ground in this quarter. General Irem-bert was ſhot at the head of the army on the 9th of November, upon a charge, probably ill-founded, of treachery in the affair of the lines of weiſſembourg, On tlie 14th, however, Fort Louis was taken by tlie allies, not without ſuſpicion of treachery in tlie governor. But here the ſucceſs of general wurmſer might be ſaid to terminate. On tbe 2iſt tlie republican ar-my drove back tlie Auſtrians, and penetrated almoſt to Hagenau. An army from tlie Moſelle now advanced to co-operate with tlie army of tlie Rhine. On tlie 1 7th the Pruffians were defeated near Sarhruck. Next day tlieir camp at Blieſcaſtel was ſtormed, and the Frencli advanced to Deux Ponts. On the 29th and 30th tbe Frencli were repulſed witli great loſs in two violent attacks made on the duke of Brtinſwick near Lautern. But it now appeared that tlie French had come into tlie field witli a determination to conquer whatever it might coſt. Every day was a day of battle, and torrents of blood were ſhed on both ſides. The allies had the advantage of poffeffing the ground, wliicli, in that quarter, at ſuch a late ſeafon of tlie year, is very ſtrong on account of its inequalities and moraffes. In military ſkill, the French officers and thoſe of the allies were perhaps nearly equal ; but the French army was by ſar the moſt numerous ; and although not a match in point of diſcipline, yet it derived no ſmall ſuperiority from the enthuſiaſm with which the troops were animated. On the 8tli of December, under the command of general Pichegru, the French carried the redoubts which covered Hagenau by means of the bayonet.</p><p>Tliis modern inſtrument of deſtruction, againſt whicli no deſenſive weapon is employed, is always moſt ſucceſs-ful in the hands of the moſt intrepid ; and it was now a dreadful engine in the hands of French enthuſiaſm.— The ſineſt troops that ever Europe produced were unable to withſtand the fury of the republicans, which ſeemed only to increaſe in proportion to the multitude of companions that they loſt. On the 22d the allies were driven with immenſe ſiaugliter from Hagenau, not-withſtanding tlie iinrnenſe works they liad thrown up for their defence. The entrenchments on tlie heights of Reiſhoffen, Jauderſhoffen, &amp;C. were conſidered as more impregnable than thoſe of Jemappe. They were ſtormed by the army of the Moſelle and the Rhine, under generals Hoche and Pichegru. On the 23d and 24th, die allies were purſued to the heights of wrotte. On the 26th, the entrenchments there were forced by tlie bayonet, after a deſperate conflict. O11 the 27th, the republican army arrived at weiffembourg in tri-umph. General wurmſer retreated acroſs the Rhine, and the duke of Brunſwick haſtily fell back to cover Mentz. The blockade of Landau, which had laſted four months, was raiſed. Fort Louis was evsffcuated by the allies, and Kaiſerſſatern, Germerſheim, and Spires, ſubmitted to the French.—During this laſt month of the year 1793, the loſs of men on both ſideg</p><lb/><p>in this quarter was immenſe, and unexampled in the hiſtory of modern war. It is even ſaid that it might amount to more than 70,000 or 80,000 men.</p><p>Thus far we have attended to the military affairs of the republic for ſome time paſt. Very violent efforts were iu the mean time made at Paris by the new admi-niſtration, eſtabliſhed under the auſpices of the Jacobin club, and of the party called the <hi rend="italic">Mountain.</hi>  The new republican conſtitution had been preſented to the people in the primary affemblies, and accepted. The buſmeſs, therefore, for which the convention was called toge-ther, that of forming a conſtitution for France, was at an end ; and it was propoſed that they ſhould diffolve themſelves, and order a new legiſſative body to aſ-ſemble, according to the rules preſcribed by that con-ſtitution. This was, no doubt, the regular mode of procedure ; but the ruling party conſidered it as hazardous to convene a new aſſembly, poffeffing only limited powers, in the preſent diſtracted ſtate of the country. It was indeed obvious, that France at this time ſtood in need of a dictatorſhip, or of a government poffeffed of more abſolute authority than can be enjoyed by one that acts, or even pretends to act, upon the moderate principles of freedom. It was therefore determined that the convention ſhould remain undiffolved till the end of the war ; and that a <hi rend="italic">revolutionary</hi>  government, to be conducted by its members, ſhould be eſtabliſhed, with uncontrouled powers. Committees of its own body were ſelected for the purpoſe of conducting every department of buſineſs. The chief of theſe committees was called the <hi rend="italic">committee of public ſafety.</hi>  It ſuper-intended all the reſt, and gave to the adminiſtration of France all the ſecrecy and diſpatch which have been accounted peculiar to a military government, together with a. combination of ſkill and energy hitherto un-known among mankind. A correſpondence was kept up with all the Jacobin clubs throughout tlie kingdom. Commiffioners from the convention were ſent into all quarters, with unlimited authority over every order of perſons. Thus a government poffeffed of infinite vigilance, and more abſolute and tyrannical than that of any ſingle deſpot, was eſtabliſhed ; and tlie whole tranſactions and reſources of the ſtate were known to the rulers. On the 23d of Auguſt, Barrere, in name of the committee of public ſaſety, procured the celebrated decree to be paffed for placing the whole French nation in a <hi rend="italic">fate of requiftion</hi>  for the public ſervice. “ From this moment (ſays the decree) till that when all enemies ſhall have been driven from the territory of the republic, all Frenchmen ſhall be in perma-nent readineſs ſor the ſervice oſ tlie army. The young men ſhall march to the combat ; the married men ſhaſt forge arms, and tranſport the proviſions ; tlie women ſhall make tents and clothes, and attend in tlie hoſpitals ; the children ſhall make lint oſ old linen ; tlie old men ſhall cauſe themſelves to be carried to the public ſquares, to excite the courage of tlie warriors, to pleach hatred againſt the enemies of the republic; tlie cellars ſllall be waſhed to procure ſaltpetre ; tbe ſaddle-horſes ſhall be given up to complete the cavalry ; the unmarried citizens, ſrom the age oſ 18 to 25, ſhall march ſirſt, and none ſhall ſend a ſubſtitute ; every battalion ſhall liave a banner, with this inſcription, <hi rend="italic">The French nation riſen agaiofl tyrants.”</hi>  The decree alſo regulates the mode of organizing this maſs.
