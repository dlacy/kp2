<p><span class="font0">takes up in his hand ſuch as are flack,- and draws them tight, keeping them ſo till he reaches the upper end,&nbsp;where he cuts the yarns to a length, again adjuſts their&nbsp;tightneſs, and joins them all .together in a knot, to&nbsp;which he fixes the hook of a tackle, the other block of&nbsp;which is fixed to a firm poft, called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vυarping-ρofl.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;ſkain is well ſtretched by this tackle, and then ſeparated&nbsp;into its different ſtrands. Each of theſe is knotted a-part at both ends. The knots at their upper ends are&nbsp;made faſt to the hooks of the cranks in the tackle-board,&nbsp;and thoſe at their lower ends are faſtened to the cranks&nbsp;in the fledge. The fledge itſelf is kept in its place by&nbsp;a tackle, by which the ſtrands are again ſtretched in&nbsp;their places, and every thing adjuſted, ſo that the fledge&nbsp;ſtands ſquare on the walk, and then a proper weight&nbsp;is laid on it. The tackle is now cut off, and the cranks&nbsp;are turned at both ends, in the contrary direction to&nbsp;the twiſt of the yarns. (In feme kinds of cordage&nbsp;the cranks are turned the ſame way with the ſpinning&nbsp;twiſt). By this the ſtrands are twiſted and hardened&nbsp;up ; and as they contract by this operation, the fledge&nbsp;is dragged up the walk. When the foreman thinks the&nbsp;ſtrands ſuſſiciently hardened, which he eſtimates by&nbsp;the motion of the fledge, he orders the heavers at the&nbsp;cranks to ſtop. The middle ſtrand at the ſledge is taken off from the crank. This crank is taken out, and&nbsp;a ſtronger one put in its place at D, fig. 9. The other&nbsp;ſtrands are taken off from their cranks, and all are joined on the hook which is now in the middle hole. The&nbsp;top is then placed between the ſtrands, and, being preſe-ed home to the point of their union, the car riage is&nbsp;placed under it, and it is firmly fixed down. Some&nbsp;weight is taken off the ſledge. The heavers now begin&nbsp;to turn at both ends. Thoſe at the tackle-board continue to turn as they did before ; but the heavers at the&nbsp;fledge turn in the oppoſite direction to their former motion, ſo that the cranks at both ends are now turning&nbsp;one way. By the motion of the ſledge crank the top&nbsp;is forced away from the knot, and the rope begins to&nbsp;cloſe. The heaving at the upper end reltores to the&nbsp;ſtrand the twiſt which they are conſtantly loling by the&nbsp;laying of the rope. '1 he workmen judge of this by&nbsp;making a chalk mark on intermediate points of the&nbsp;ſtrands, where they lie on the ſtakes which are let up&nbsp;along the walk for their ſupport. If the twfiſt of the&nbsp;ſtrands is diminiſhed by the motion of doling, they&nbsp;will ling then, and the chalk mark will move away from&nbsp;the tackle board : but if the twiſt increaſes by turning&nbsp;the crank-s at the tackle-board, the ſtrands will ſhorten,&nbsp;and the mark will come nearer to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the doling of the rope advances, the whole ſhortens, and the ſledge is dragged up the walk. The&nbsp;top moves faſter, and at· laſt reaches the upper end of&nbsp;the walk, the rope being now laid. In the mean time,&nbsp;the fledge has moved ſeveral fathoms from the place&nbsp;where it was when the laying began.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe motιor13 of the ſledge and top muſt be exactly adjuſted to each other. The rope muſt be of a certain&nbsp;length. Therefore the ſledge muſt ſtop at a certain&nbsp;place. At that moment the rope ſhould be laid ; that&nbsp;is, the top ſhould be at the tackle board. In this conſiſts the addrcſs of the foreman. He has his attention&nbsp;directed both ways. He looks at the ſtrands, and when&nbsp;he ſecs any oſ them hanging flacker betw<sup>,</sup>een the flakes&nbsp;than the others, he calls to the heavers at the tackle·&nbsp;board to heave more upon that ſtrand. He finds it&nbsp;more difficult to regulate the motion of the top. It requires a conſiderable force to keep it in the angle oſ the&nbsp;ſtrands, and it is always diſpoſed to ſtart forward. Tc&gt;&nbsp;prevent or check this, ſome ſtraps of ſoſt rope are&nbsp;brought round the ſtaff of the top, and then wrapped&nbsp;ſeveral times round the rope behind the top, and kept&nbsp;firmly down by a lanyard or bandage, as is ſhown in&nbsp;the figure. This both holds back the top and greatly&nbsp;aſſiſts the laying of the rope, cauling the ſtrands to fall&nbsp;into their places, and keep cloſe to each other. This is&nbsp;ſometimes very difficult, eſpecially in ropes compoſed of&nbsp;more than three ſtrands. It will greatly improve the&nbsp;laying the rope, if the top have a ſharp, ſmooth,&nbsp;tapſering pin of hard wood, pointed at the end, projecting ſo far from the middle of its ſmaller end, that it&nbsp;gets in between the ſtrands which are cloſing. This&nbsp;ſupports them, and makes their cloſing more gradual&nbsp;and regular. The top, its notches, the pin, and the&nbsp;warp or ſtrap, which is lapped round the rope, are all&nbsp;ſmeared wſith greaſe or ſoap to aſſiſt the cloſing. The&nbsp;foreman judges of the progreſs of cloſing chiefly by his&nbsp;acquaintance with the w∙alk, knowing that when the&nbsp;fledge is abreaſt of a certain ſtake the top ſhould be a-breaſt of a certain other 'lake. When he finds the top&nbsp;too far down the walk, he flackens the motion at the&nbsp;tackle board, and makes the men turn briſkly at the&nbsp;fledge. By this the top is forced up the walk, and the&nbsp;laying of the rope accelerates, while the fledge remains&nbsp;in the lame place, becauſe the ſtrands are loſing their&nbsp;twill, and are lengthening, wſhile the cloſed rope is&nbsp;ſhortening. When, on the other hand, he thinks the&nbsp;top too far advanced, and fears that it will be at the&nbsp;head oſ the walk before the fledge has got to its proper&nbsp;place, he makes the men heave briſkly on the ſtrands,&nbsp;and the heavers at the fledge crank to work ſoftly.—-This quickens the motion of the .ſledge by ſhortening&nbsp;the ſtrands ; and by thus compenſating what has&nbsp;been overdone, the ſledge and top come to their places&nbsp;at once, and the work appears to anſwer the intention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But this is a bad manner of proceeding, lt is evident, that if the I! rands be kept to one degree of hard-neſs throughout, and the heaving at the fledge be uniformly continued, the rope will be uniform. It may be a little longer or ſhorter than was intended, and the&nbsp;laying may be too hard in proportion to the twiſt of&nbsp;the ſtrands, in which caſe it will not keep it ; or it may&nbsp;be too flack, and the rope will tend to twi more. Either oſ theſe faults are diſcoverable by flackening the&nbsp;rope before it come off the hooks, and it may then be&nbsp;corrected. But if the error in one place be compenſated&nbsp;by that in another, this will not be eaſily ſeen before&nbsp;taking off the hooks ; and if it is a large and Iliff rope,&nbsp;it will hardly ever come to an equable ſtate in its different parts, but wall be apt to run into loops during&nbsp;ſervice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is, therefore,-of importance to preſerve the uniformity throughout the w hole. Mr Du Hamel, in his great work on rope-making, propoſes a method which&nbsp;is very exact, but requires an apparatus which is cumbersome, and which would be much in the way of the&nbsp;workmen. We .think that the following method would&nbsp;be extremely eaſy, embarraſs no one, and is perfectly&nbsp;exact. Having determined the proportion between the&nbsp;velocity of the top and fledge, let the diameter of the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
