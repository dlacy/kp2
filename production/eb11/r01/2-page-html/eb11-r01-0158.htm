<p><span class="font2">in St Petersburg. He preached at times in the German Lutheran church, wrote his first tragedies, and in 1817 was&nbsp;appointed professor of German literature and history at a&nbsp;training college in connexion with the university. Owing to&nbsp;an outburst of jealousy against Germans in Russia, culminating&nbsp;in police supervision, Raupach left St Petersburg in 1822 and&nbsp;undertook a journey to Italy. The literary fruits of his travels&nbsp;were </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hirsemenzels Briefe aus und über Italien</span><span class="font2"> (1823). He&nbsp;next visited Weimar, but, being coldly received by Goethe,&nbsp;abandoned his idea of living there and settled in 1824 in Berlin.&nbsp;Here he spent the remainder of his life, writing for the stage,&nbsp;which for twenty years he greatly influenced, if not wholly&nbsp;controlled, in the Prussian capital. He died at Berlin on the&nbsp;18th of March 1852.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Raupach was a prolific writer of both tragedies and comedies; of the former, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die Fürsten Chawansky</span><span class="font2"> (1818), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Der Liebe Zauberkreis</span><span class="font2"> (1824), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die Leibeigenen, oder Isidor und Olga</span><span class="font2"> (1826),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rafaele</span><span class="font2"> (1828), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Der Nibelungenhort</span><span class="font2"> (1834) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die Schule des&nbsp;Lebens</span><span class="font2"> (1841), and of the latter </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die Schleichhändler</span><span class="font2"> (1828) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Der Zeitgeist</span><span class="font2"> (1830) are pieces which have enjoyed great popularity owing to their skilful dramatic handling. On the other&nbsp;hand, the historical dramas with which his name is chiefly&nbsp;associated, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die Hohenstaufen</span><span class="font2"> (1837-38), a cyclus of 15 dramatic&nbsp;pieces founded on Friedrich von Raumer’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Geschichte der Hohenstaufen,</span><span class="font2"> as also the trilogy </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cromwell</span><span class="font2"> (1841-44), are superficial&nbsp;in treatment. Raupach had a great knowledge of theatrical&nbsp;effect and situations, but he contorts historical facts in order&nbsp;to suit his political hobby, which was the separation of church&nbsp;and state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Raupach’s collected dramas appeared under the title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dramatische Werke ernster Gattung</span><span class="font1"> (16 vols., </span><span class="font2">1830-43) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dramatische Werke&nbsp;komischer Gattung</span><span class="font1"> (4 vols., </span><span class="font2">1829-35).

<p><span class="font2">RAVAILLAC, FRANÇOIS (1578-1610), the assassin of Henry IV. of France, was born near Angoulême. He was of&nbsp;humble origin and began life as a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">valet de chambre,</span><span class="font2"> but afterwards became a lawyer and also teacher of a school. After&nbsp;having been imprisoned by his creditors, he sought admission&nbsp;to the recently founded order of Feuillants, but after a short&nbsp;probation was dismissed as a visionary. An application for&nbsp;admission to the Society of Jesus was equally unsuccessful in&nbsp;1606. His disappointments fostered a fanatical temperament,&nbsp;and rumours that the king was intending to make war upon&nbsp;the pope suggested to him the idea of assassination, which he&nbsp;carried out on the 14th of May 1610. In the course of his trial&nbsp;he was frequently put to the torture, but persistently (and it is&nbsp;now believed truly) denied that he had been prompted by any one or had any accomplices. Sentence of death was carried out&nbsp;on the 27th of May following.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAVAISSON-MOLLIEN, JEAN GASPARD FÉLIX (1813-1900), French philosopher and archaeologist, was born at Namur on the 23rd of October 1813. After a successful course of study&nbsp;at the Collège Rollin, he proceeded to Munich, where he attended&nbsp;the lectures of Schelling, and took his degree in philosophy&nbsp;in 1836. In the following year he published the first volume of&nbsp;his famous work </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essai sur la métaphysique d’Aristote,</span><span class="font2"> to which&nbsp;in 1846 he added a supplementary volume. This work not&nbsp;only criticizes and comments on the theories of Aristotle and&nbsp;the Peripatetics, but also deduces from them a modem philo-sophical system. In 1838 he received the degree of doctor,&nbsp;and became professor of philosophy at Rennes. From 1840&nbsp;he was inspector-general of public libraries, and in i860 became&nbsp;inspector-general in the department of higher education. He&nbsp;was also a member of the Academy, and of the Academy of Moral&nbsp;and Political Science, and curator of the Department of Antiquities at the Louvre (from 1870). He died in Paris on the&nbsp;18th of May 1900. In philosophy, he was one of the school of&nbsp;Cousin, with whom, however, he was at issue in many important&nbsp;points. The act of consciousness, according to him, is the basis&nbsp;of all knowledge. These acts of consciousness are manifestations of will, which is the motive and creative power of the&nbsp;intellectual life. The idea of God is a cumulative intuition&nbsp;given by all the various faculties of the mind, in its observation&nbsp;of harmony in nature and in man. This theory had considerable&nbsp;influence on speculative philosophy in France during the later&nbsp;years of the 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ravaisson’s chief philosophical works are: “Les Fragments philosophiques de Hamilton ” (in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Revue des Deux Mondes,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">November, 1840); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rapport sur le stoicisme</span><span class="font1"> (1851); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">La Philosophie&nbsp;en France au dix-neuvième siècle</span><span class="font1"> (1868; 3rd ed., 1889); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morale et&nbsp;métaphysique</span><span class="font1"> (1893). Eminent as a philosopher, Ravaisson was&nbsp;also an archaeologist, and contributed articles on ancient sculpture&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Revue Archéologique</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires de l'Académie des&nbsp;Inscriptions.</span><span class="font1"> In 1871 he published a monograph on the Venus of&nbsp;Milo.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAVANASTRON, an Indian stringed instrument played with a bow, used by wandering pilgrims. A Hindu tradition affirms&nbsp;that the musical bow was invented before 3000 b.c. by Ravanon,&nbsp;king of Ceylon, and that the instrument for which he invented&nbsp;it was named after him Ravanastron.@@<sup>1</sup> Judging from precedent,&nbsp;it is probable that the ravanastron of the present day has&nbsp;changed little, if at all, for many centuries. It consists of&nbsp;half a round gourd, over which is fixed a sound-board of skin&nbsp;or parchment; to this primitive body without incurvation is&nbsp;attached a neck about twice the length of the body. The strings&nbsp;are either one or four in number, the pegs being set in the sides&nbsp;of the neck. The bridge is primitive and either straight or&nbsp;slightly arched, so that in bowing more than one string sounds&nbsp;at once.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ravanastron is regarded by some writers as the first ancestor of the violin, on account of the alleged invention of the bow for use&nbsp;with it. This theory can only be accepted by those who consider&nbsp;the bow, which after all was common to such inferior instruments&nbsp;as the rebec, as of paramount importance, and the structural features&nbsp;of the instrument itself, the box sound-chest with ribs, which have&nbsp;always belonged to the most artistic types of instruments, such as&nbsp;the cithara and the guitar-fiddle, as of secondary importance.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAVELLO, </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">village of Campania, Italy, in the province of Salerno, about 3 m. N.N.E. of Amalfi by road, 1227 ft. above&nbsp;sea-level. It commands a magnificent view. Pop. (1901)&nbsp;1851. The history of Ravello cannot be traced beyond the&nbsp;9th century. In the nth it was called Rebellum, because&nbsp;it refused to acknowledge the sovereignty of Amalfi, and in&nbsp;the 13th, when at the height of its prosperity, it had 36,000&nbsp;inhabitants. The Palazzo Rufolo, begun in the nth century,&nbsp;has two lofty towers and beautiful Saracenic decoration in&nbsp;the courtyard. The ex-cathedral of S. Pantaleo, almost&nbsp;entirely modernized, has fine bronze doors by Barisanus of&nbsp;Trani (1179), and two pulpits in Cosmatesque work. The&nbsp;larger, supported by six columns resting on the backs of lions,&nbsp;was made in 1272 by Nicolaus of Foggia; the bust over the&nbsp;entrance to it is said to be a portrait of Sigilgaita Rufolo. The&nbsp;smaller, of the same date, is simpler, and has curious repre-sentations of Jonah and the whale. The parish church of&nbsp;S. Giovanni in Toro, spoilt by restorations in the 18th century,&nbsp;contains a splendid pulpit in Cosmatesque work, supported on&nbsp;four pillars, and the crypt some 14th-century frescoes. In&nbsp;front of it is the porch of the Palazzo dell’ Afflitto, composed&nbsp;of ancient fragments. S. Maria Immacolata is another Roman-esque church.</span></p>
