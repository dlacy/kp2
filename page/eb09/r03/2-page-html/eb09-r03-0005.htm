        <p><span class="font0">Almost all writers—Voigt@@<sup>2</sup> is a distinguished
                exception—concur in opinion that the nexal contract entitled the creditor, after
                expiry&nbsp;of thirty days from the conventional date of repayment of the
                loan,&nbsp;to proceed against his debtor by </span><span class="font0"

                antecedent action or judgment, and failing settlement to detain him,&nbsp;and put
                him to servile labour and subject him to servile treatment,&nbsp;until the loan was
                repaid. The parallel of such a course is to be&nbsp;met with amongst all ancient
                nations,—Jews, Greeks, Scandinavians,&nbsp;Germans, &amp;c@@<sup>3</sup> And it was
                not altogether unreasonable. If a&nbsp;borrower had already exhausted all available
                means of raising&nbsp;money, had sold or mortgaged everything he possessed of any
                value,&nbsp;what other course was open to him in his necessity except to im-pledge
                himself ? That the creditor should have been entitled to&nbsp;realize the right he
                had thus acquired without the judgment on it&nbsp;of a court of law is equally
                intelligible: The nexal contract was a&nbsp;public act, carried out in the presence
                of the representatives of the&nbsp;people, who Were witnesses alike of the
                acknowledgment of indebtedness and of the tacit engagement of the debtor. The only
                valid objection that could be stated against the creditor’s apprehension of&nbsp;his
                debtor in execution was that the indebtedness no longer existed,&nbsp;—that the loan
                had been repaid. But a nexal debt could be legally&nbsp;discharged only by
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nexi liberatio,</span><span
                class="font0"> which also was a solemn procedure </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">per acs et libram</span><span class="font0"> in the
                presence of five citizen witnesses. What&nbsp;need for a judicial inquiry in the
                presence of facts so notorious ? A&nbsp;creditor would rarely be daring enough to
                proceed to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus
                injectio&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">if his loan had been repaid ; if he did,
                the testimony of the witnesses to the discharge would at once procure the release of
                his&nbsp;alleged debtor. It was probably to give opportunity for such proof,&nbsp;if
                there was room for it, that the XII. Tables required that a creditor&nbsp;who had
                apprehended a nexal debtor should bring him into court&nbsp;before carrying him off
                into detention.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">But there was no room for the intervention of a </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vindex</span><span class="font0"> or
                champion, for there was no judgment whose regularity he could impugn. Nor was there
                any room for a magisterial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >addictio</span><span class="font0"> of the debtor&nbsp;to his creditor ; for the
                latter’s right of detention was founded on&nbsp;contract, and needed no decree to
                strengthen it. The creditor was&nbsp;entitled at once, after apprehension of his
                debtor and production of&nbsp;him in court in terms of the statute, to carry him
                home with him,&nbsp;take such steps as were necessary to ensure his safe custody,
                and&nbsp;employ his services in profitable industry. But that he could kill&nbsp;him
                or sell him, as some suppose, is a proposition that is destitute&nbsp;of any
                authority to support it. Equally untenable is the notion</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >nexus</span><span class="font0"> became a slave, or that, while retaining his
                freedom, his wife, children, and belongings fell with him into the hands of&nbsp;his
                creditor. He certainly was not in a worse position than an&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">addictus,</span><span class="font0"> of
                whom Quintilian states distinctly that he still retained&nbsp;his position in the
                census and in his tribe. Many a time, when the&nbsp;exigencies of the state required
                it, were the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ncxi</span><span
                class="font0"> temporarily released&nbsp;in order to obey a call to arms,—to fulfil
                the duty incumbent on&nbsp;them as citizens. In fact a nexal debtor suffered no

                demin-•utio</span><span class="font0"> at all because of his detention. If he was a

                style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> over his wife and
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span
                class="font0"> over his children.&nbsp;But they did not share his quasi-servitude.
                Their earnings legally&nbsp;belonged to him, but were no doubt retained by them with
                his&nbsp;consent for their own support. They certainly did not fall to
                his&nbsp;creditor. It was the body of his debtor that he was entitled to,&nbsp;and
                too often he wreaked his vengeance on it by way of punishment ;&nbsp;there was as
                yet no machinery for attaching the debtor’s goods in&nbsp;substantial reparation for
                the loss caused by his breach of contract.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The abuses to which the system gave rise alike in the case of nexal
                and of judgment debtors have already been alluded to. In the&nbsp;year 428 a more

                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nexi,</span><span
                class="font0"> who, Livy says, had given&nbsp;himself up as responsible for a loan
                contracted by his deceased&nbsp;father, roused the populace to such a pitch of
                indignation as to&nbsp;necessitate instant remedial legislation. The result was the
                Poe-tilian law </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Lex Poetilia
                Papiria).</span><span class="font0"> So far as can be gathered from the&nbsp;meagre
                accounts of it we possess, it contained at least these three&nbsp;provisions—(1)
                that fetters and neck, arm, or foot blocks should in&nbsp;future be applied only to
                persons undergoing imprisonment for crime&nbsp;or delict ; (2) that no one should
                ever again be the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"

                > should be released. The first was&nbsp;intended to prevent unnecessary restraint
                upon judgment-debtors&nbsp;formally given over to their creditors. The second did
                not necessarily abolish the contract of loan </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">per acs et libram,</span><span class="font0"> but only
                what&nbsp;had hitherto been an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >ipso jure</span><span class="font0"> consequence of it,—the creditor’s&nbsp;right
                to incarcerate his debtor without either the judgment of a&nbsp;court or the warrant
                of a magistrate. For the future, execution&nbsp;was to be done against a borrower
                only as a judgment-debtor formally made over to his creditor by magisterial decree,
                and under the&nbsp;restrictions and limitations imposed by the Poetilian law
                itself.&nbsp;This very soon led to the disuse of nexal obligation ; once it
                was&nbsp;deprived of its distinctive processual advantages it rapidly
                gave&nbsp;place to the simpler engagement by stipulation enforceable </span><span

                probably we ought to do—that the release spoken of was only from the&nbsp;bonds of
                physical restraint, not from those of legal obligation.</span></p>

                    Stipulation@@<sup>4</sup>
            </span><span class="font1">Few events in the history of the private law were followed by
                more far-reaching consequences than the introduction of the stipulation. It
                exercised an enormous influence on the law of&nbsp;contract ; for by means of it
                there was created a unilateral&nbsp;obligation that in time became adaptable to
                almost every&nbsp;conceivable undertaking by one man in favour of another.&nbsp;By
                the use of certain words of style in the form of question and answer any lawful
                agreement could thereby be&nbsp;made not only morally but legally binding, so that
                much&nbsp;which previously had no other guarantee than a man’s&nbsp;sense of honour
                now passed directly under the protection&nbsp;of the tribunals. Stipulations became
                the complement of&nbsp;engagements which without them rested simply on
                good&nbsp;faith, as when a vendor gave his stipulatory promise to&nbsp;his vendee to
                guarantee peaceable possession of the thing&nbsp;sold or its freedom from faults,
                and the vendee in turn&nbsp;gave his promise for payment of the price. The
                question&nbsp;and answer in the form prescribed by law made the engagement fast and
                sure. Hence the generic name of the</span></p>
