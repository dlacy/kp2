        <p><span class="font2">included, with powers which are the more extensive as they are
                totally undefined. There is also in each government&nbsp;a special gendarmerie under
                the “chief of gendarmes,”&nbsp;who usually is also the head of the “ third section ”
                of the&nbsp;Imperial Chancery. The name of the third section has&nbsp;been recently
                abolished, but the institution still continues.&nbsp;It has charge of the secret
                police of the state, and has&nbsp;most varied functions, such as the arrest of
                supposed&nbsp;political offenders, their exile to Siberia, the delivery
                of&nbsp;separation papers to spouses desiring divorce, and so on.&nbsp;Several
                governments are placed under special governors general, whom the recent law on the
                “state of siege”&nbsp;invests with almost dictatorial powers.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The higher administration is represented by the emperor, who unites
                the supreme legislative, executive, and judicial&nbsp;powers, and is surrounded by
                four distinct councils—the&nbsp;committee of ministers, the council of the empire,
                the&nbsp;senate, and the Holy Synod. The ministers, who are considered as executing
                the will of the czar, and are nominated&nbsp;by him, are invested with very
                extensive powers ; their&nbsp;circulars for the interpretation of laws have greater
                weight&nbsp;than the laws themselves. The council of the empire,&nbsp;which
                consisted in 1881 of 64 members, nominated by the&nbsp;emperor, besides the
                ministers and several members of the&nbsp;imperial family, is a consultative body
                for matters of legislation. The senate, also nominated by the emperor, has&nbsp;two
                distinct functions. Seven “ departments ” of it are&nbsp;administrative ; they
                promulgate the laws, examine the acts&nbsp;of governors, adjudicate in their
                conflicts with zemstvos,&nbsp;and, in theory, can make remonstrances to the
                emperor,—&nbsp;in fact they merely register and promulgate laws. Two&nbsp;other “
                departments ” are courts of cassation. A special&nbsp;department, reinforced by
                representatives of nobility, pronounces judgment in political cases. The Holy
                Synod,&nbsp;consisting of metropolitans and bishops who sit there in&nbsp;turn, has
                the superintendence of religious affairs.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The judicial system introduced in 1864 was conceived in a very
                liberal spirit, which, unfortunately, has not been maintained. Thus a “preliminary
                instruction,” made by the “third&nbsp;section” in political cases, Jor by the
                police, has been subsequently introduced. The “judges of instruction,” irremovable
                by&nbsp;law, have not yet been nominated, their functions being discharged&nbsp;by
                substitutes entirely dependent upon the ministry. Elective&nbsp;justices of the
                peace decide in all cases involving less than 500&nbsp;roubles, or less than six
                months’ imprisonment. Their decisions&nbsp;can be brought by appeal before the
                district gathering of the justices of the peace, and thence before the senate. All
                criminal&nbsp;cases involving severer penalties are tried by juries, whose
                verdicts&nbsp;can be set aside only by a court of cassation, but are not
                respected&nbsp;in cases having a so-called “ political ” aspect. Political
                offences&nbsp;are tried by tribunals composed </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">ad hoc.</span><span class="font1"> Civil cases in which
                more&nbsp;than 500 roubles are involved are tried by courts of justice,
                with&nbsp;appeal to chambers of justice.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In 1879 in European Russia,—exclusive of six Lithuanian and White
                Russian governments,—42,530 persons were tried before the&nbsp;courts, and 59,600
                before the justices of the peace, the convictions&nbsp;being respectively 27,397 and
                36,742. The aggregate number of&nbsp;condemnations pronounced in 1882 was 46,018 in
                European Russia,&nbsp;that is, 5<sup>-</sup>9 condemned in each 10,000 ; only 4836
                of them were&nbsp;women. On January 1, 1882, 93,108 persons were in jail ;
                530,307&nbsp;men and 66,073 women (the latter with 30,769 children)
                were&nbsp;imprisoned during the year, while 625,280 prisoners were liberated&nbsp;or
                exiled, and on January 1, 1883, the number of prisoners in&nbsp;jail (excluding
                those of Saghalin and Caucasus) was 97,337. More&nbsp;than 20,000 are annually
                transported to Siberia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The empire is divided for administrative purposes into governments
                (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">guberniya)</span><span
                class="font1"> or territories (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >oblast),</span><span class="font1"> of which there are 50 in European Russia and 10
                in Poland. Each government, or territory,&nbsp;is divided into eight to fifteen
                districts </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guyezd).</span><span
                class="font1"> The Asiatic&nbsp;dominions are divided into one lieutenancy
                (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >namyestnitchestvo),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">that of Caucasia, and four
                general governments—Turkestan,&nbsp;Stepnoye (Kirghiz Steppes), East Siberia, and
                Amur. They comprise thirty-three governments and territories, besides a few
                districts </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">GJkrug,
                Otdyel)</span><span class="font1"> in Transcaucasia and the
                Transcaspian&nbsp;region, regarded almost as separate governments. In Siberia
                the&nbsp;governors and governors-general are assisted by councils which&nbsp;have a
                consultative voice. The Baltic provinces have some&nbsp;peculiar institutions.
                Finland is a separate state, having its own&nbsp;finances, army, and representative
                institutions, with limited rights,&nbsp;but its ministers of war and the exterior
                are those of the empire,&nbsp;and its institutions are not always respected by the
                emperor.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The emperor is not the head of the church, all decisions in
                theological matters having to be given by the Synod. His influence, however, is very
                great, as the nomination of the bishops rests with&nbsp;him. In 1882 there were in
                Russia 40,569 Orthodox churches&nbsp;and about 14,000 chapels, with 37,318 priests,
                7009 deacons, and&nbsp;45,395 singers. There were also 6752 monks and 3957
                aspirants,&nbsp;4945 nuns and 13,803 female aspirants. The church budget
                was&nbsp;18,974,887 roubles in 1884. The monasteries and churches are&nbsp;possessed
                of great wealth, including 2950 square miles of land (a&nbsp;territory greater than
                that of Oldenburg), an invested capital of&nbsp;22,634,000 roubles, an annual
                subsidy of 408,000 roubles from&nbsp;Government, and a very great number of inns,
                shops, printing&nbsp;establishments, burial grounds, &amp;c., with whole towns
                covering an&nbsp;aggregate area of 10 1/</span><span class="font0">2</span><span
                class="font1"> square miles. Their total annual revenue is&nbsp;estimated at
                9,000,000 roubles.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Much still remains to be done for the diffusion of the first elements
                of a sound education throughout the empire ; unhappily&nbsp;the endeavours of
                private persons in this field and of the zemstvos&nbsp;are for political reasons
                discouraged by the Government. There&nbsp;are seven universities—Dorpat, Kazan,
                Kharkoff, Kieff, Moscow,&nbsp;Odessa, and St Petersburg—to which may be added those
                of&nbsp;Warsaw and Helsingfors. In 1883 the seven Russian universities&nbsp;had 605
                professors and 10,528 students, and there were 81 professors and 1228 students at
                Warsaw. The standard of teaching&nbsp;on the whole is high, and may be compared to
                that of the German&nbsp;universities. The students are hardworking, and generally
                very&nbsp;intelligent. Mostly sons of poor parents, they live in
                extreme&nbsp;poverty, supporting themselves chiefly by translating and by
                tutorial&nbsp;work. Severe measures have been taken in 1885 in regard to
                the&nbsp;universities. Explicit regulations for the interpretation of
                science&nbsp;have been issued, and restrictions laid upon the teaching of philosophy
                and natural science generally ; comparative legislation has&nbsp;been excluded from
                the programmes ; teaching in Russian (instead&nbsp;of German) has been ordered at
                Dorpat. The students are placed&nbsp;under rigorous regulations in regard to their
                life outside the university. About 950 students in theological academies and
                2500&nbsp;in higher technical schools must be added to the above.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The state of secondary education still leaves very much to be
                desired. There were in 1883 180 gymnasiums and progymnasiums&nbsp;for boys in
                European Russia, and 24 in the Asiatic dominions, and&nbsp;27 and 10 respectively
                for girls; there were also 73 “real”&nbsp;schools in European Russia and 8 in the
                Asiatic dominions, and 48&nbsp;normal schools in Russia and 10 in the Asiatic
                dominions. To&nbsp;these must be added the 14,800 pupils in 53 theological
                seminaries,&nbsp;and about 3000 in various secondary schools. The steady
                tendency&nbsp;of Russian society towards increasing the number of
                secondary&nbsp;schools, where instruction would be based on the study of
                the&nbsp;natural sciences, is checked by Government in favour of the&nbsp;classical
                gymnasiums. The aggregate number of schools for secondary instruction in European
                Russia in 1882 was 456 for boys and&nbsp;384 for girls, with 107,930 male and 79,625
                female scholars. Of&nbsp;these, 355 schools (45,303 boys and 3199 girls) give
                professional&nbsp;education.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">For· primary instruction there were in 1882 in European Russia proper
                28,329 schools, with 1,177,504 male and 362,471 female&nbsp;pupils. Of the 6,231,160
                roubles expended on primary schools&nbsp;only 747,772 roubles were contributed by
                Government, the&nbsp;remainder being supplied by the zemstvos (2,512,113 roubles),
                by&nbsp;municipalities, or by private persons. Sunday schools and
                public&nbsp;lectures are virtually prohibited.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">A characteristic feature of the intellectual movement in Russia is
                its tendency to extend to women the means of receiving higher&nbsp;instruction. The
                gymnasiums for girls are both numerous and&nbsp;good. In addition to these,
                notwithstanding Government opposition, a series of higher schools, where careful
                instruction in natural&nbsp;and social sciences is given, have been opened in the
                chief cities&nbsp;under the name of ‘‘Pedagogical Courses.” At St Petersburg
                a&nbsp;women’s medical academy, the examinations of which were even&nbsp;more
                searching than those of the ordinary academy (especially as&nbsp;regards diseases of
                women and children), was opened, but after&nbsp;about one hundred women had received
                the degree of M.D., it has&nbsp;been suppressed by Government. In several university
                towns&nbsp;there are also free teaching establishments for women, supported&nbsp;by
                subscription, with programmes and examinations equal to those&nbsp;of the
                universities. In 1882 the students numbered 914 at St&nbsp;Petersburg, about 500 at
                Moscow, and 389 at Kazan.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The natural sciences are much cultivated in Russia, especially during
                the last twenty years. Besides the Academy of Science, the&nbsp;Moscow Society of
                Naturalists, the Mineralogical Society, the&nbsp;Geographical Society, with its
                Caucasian and Siberian branches, the&nbsp;archæological societies and the scientific
                societies of the Baltic provinces, all of which are of old and recognized standing,
                there have&nbsp;lately sprung up a series of new societies in connexion with
                each&nbsp;university, and their serials are yearly growing in importance,
