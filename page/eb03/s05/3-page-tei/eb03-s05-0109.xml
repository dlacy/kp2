There are five petals, each divided into two ſegments. The capſuſe is oval, unilocular, and polyſpermous. There are nine ſpecies, the nemorum, dichotoma, radians, holostea, graminea, ceraſtoides, undulata, biflora, and arenaria. Three of theſe are Britiſh plants, 1. <hi rend="italic">Nemorum,</hi> broad-leaved ſtichwort. The stalks are about a foot or eighteen inches high, and branched in a panicle at the top. The leaves are heart- ſhaped, and of a paler green on the under than on the upper side ; the lower ones being ſupported by foot- ſtalks which are hairy and channelled ; the upper ones are ſeſſile. The calyx is erect, ſomewhat hairy and white on the margins. The petals are bifid almoſt to the baſe. There is a ſmall nectarium between the longer ſtamina and the calyx. — 2. <hi rend="italic">Holoβea,</hi> greater ſtichwort. The ſtalks are about two feet long ; the petals are nearly twice the length of the calyx, and divided half-way to the baſe. It is common in woods end hedges. —3. <hi rend="italic">Graminea,</hi> leſs ſtichwort. The ſtem is near a foot high. The leaves are linear and entire, and the flowers grow in looſe panicles. It is frequent in dry paſtures. There is a variety of this ſpecies called <hi rend="italic">bog stichwort,</hi> with ſmooth, oval, ſeſſile leaves, and few leaves, which grows often in wet marshy places. The ſtalk is quadrangular ; the petals ſcarcely longer than the calyx, and bifid to the baſe.</p><p>STELLATE, among botaniſts, expreſſes leaves which grow not leſs than six at a joint, and are arranged like the rays of a ſtar.</p><p>STELLERA, <hi rend="smallcaps">German Groundsel,</hi> in botany: A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">octandria, </hi>and order of <hi rend="italic">monοgynia ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem arranged under the 31st order, V<hi rend="italic">epreculae.</hi> There is no calyx. The corolla is quadrifid. The ſtamina are very ſhort. There is only one ſeed, which is black. The ſpecies are two in number, passerina and chamaejaſme.</p><p>STELLIONATE, in the civil law, a kind of crime committed by a fraudulent bargain, where one of the parties ſells a thing for what it is not ; as if I fell an eſtate for my own which belongs to another, or convey a thing as free and clear which is already engaged to another, or put off copper for gold, &amp;c.</p><p>STEM, in botany, that part of a plant arising out of the root, and which ſuſtains the leaves, flowers, fruits, &amp;c.

The ſtem is formed of one or two pieces, according to the size of the vessel ; and as it terminates the ſhip forward, the ends of the wales and planks of the ſides and bottom are let into a groove or channel, in the midſt of its ſurface, from the top to the bottom ; which operation is called <hi rend="italic">rabiting.</hi> The outside of the ſtem is uſually marked with a ſcale, or diviſion of feet, according to its perpendicular height from the keel. The intention of this is to aſcertain the draught of water at the forepart, when the ſhip is in preparation for a ſea-voyage, &amp;c. The ſtem at its lower end is of equal breadth and thickneſs with the keel, but it grows proportionally broader and thicker towards its upper extremity.

The name was first introduced by Linnaeus.</p><p>STEMODIA, in botany : A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">didynamia,</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">angio- ſpermia ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem ranging  under the 40th order, <hi rend="italic">Personatœ.</hi> The calyx is quinquepartite ; the corolla bilabiated ; there are four ſtamina ; each of the filaments are bifid, and have two antheræ. The capſule is bilocular. There is only one ſpecies, the maritima.</p><p>STEMPHYLA, a word uſed by the ancients to expreſs the huſks of grapes, or the remains of the preſſings of wine. The ſame word is alſo uſed by ſome to expreſs the remaining maſs of the olives, after the oil is pressed out.</p><p>STEMPHYLITES, a name given by the ancients to a sort of wine preſſed hard from the hulks.</p><p>STEMPLES, in mining, croſs bars of wood in the ſhafts which are sunk to mines.</p><p>In many places the way is to fink a perpendicular hole, or ſhaft, the ſides of which they ſtrengthen from top to bottom with wood-work, to prevent the earth from falling in : the tranſverſe pieces of wood uſed to this purpoſe they call st<hi rend="italic">emples,</hi> and by means of theſe the miners in ſome places deſcend, without using any rope, catching hold of theſe with their hands and feet.</p><p>STEMSON, in a ſhip, an arching piece of timber fixed within the apron, to reinforce the ſcarf thereof, in the ſame manner as the apron ſupports the ſcarf of the ſtern. In large ſhips it is uſually formed of two pieces.</p></body></text></TEI>
