<p><span class="font5">was added by a decree of the senate Transalpine Gaul also@@<sup>1</sup> This command not only opened to him a great military career,&nbsp;but enabled him, as the master of the valley of the Po, to keep&nbsp;an effective watch on the course of affairs in Italy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Early the next year the attack upon himself which Cicero had foreseen was made. P. Clodius </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font5"> as tribune brought&nbsp;forward a law enacting that any one who had put a&nbsp;Roman citizen to death without trial by the people&nbsp;should be interdicted from fire and water. Cicero,&nbsp;finding himself deserted even by Pompey,left Rome in&nbsp;a panic, and by a second Clodian law he was declared&nbsp;to be outlawed.@@<sup>2</sup> With Caesar away in his province, and&nbsp;Cicero banished, Clodius was for the time master in Rome.&nbsp;But, absolute as he was in the streets, and recklessly as he&nbsp;parodied the policy of the Gracchi by violent attacks on the&nbsp;senate, his tribunate merely illustrated the anarchy which now&nbsp;inevitably followed the withdrawal of a strong controlling&nbsp;hand. A reaction speedily followed. Pompey, bewildered&nbsp;and alarmed by Clodius’s violence, at last bestirred himself.&nbsp;Cicero’s recall was decreed by the senate, and early in August&nbsp;57 in the </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">comitia centuriata,</span><span class="font5"> to which his Italian supporters&nbsp;flocked in crowds, a law was passed revoking the sentence of&nbsp;outlawry passed upon him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Intoxicated by the acclamations which greeted him, and encouraged by Pompey’s support, and by the salutary effects&nbsp;of Clodius’s excesses, Cicero’s hopes rose high.@@<sup>3</sup> With&nbsp;indefatigable energy he strove to reconstruct a solid&nbsp;constitutional party, hut only to fail once more.&nbsp;Pompey was irritated by the hostility of a powerful&nbsp;section in the senate, who thwarted his desires for a fresh&nbsp;command and even encouraged Clodius in insulting the conqueror of the East. Caesar became alarmed at the reports&nbsp;which reached him that the repeal of his agrarian law was&nbsp;threatened and that the feeling against the coalition was growing in strength; above all, he was anxious for a renewal of his&nbsp;five years’ command. He acted at once, and in the celebrated&nbsp;conference at Luca (56) the alliance of the three self-constituted rulers of Rome was renewed. Cicero succumbed to the inevitable and withdrew in despair from public life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font5">Pompey and Crassus became consuls for 55. Caesar’s command was renewed for another five years, and to&nbsp;each of his two allies important provinces were assigned for a&nbsp;similar period—Pompey receiving the two Spains and Africa, and&nbsp;Crassus Syria.@@<sup>4</sup> The coalition now divided between them the&nbsp;control of the empire. For the future.the question was, how&nbsp;long the coalition itself would last. Its duration proved to be&nbsp;short. In 53 Crassus was defeated and slain by the&nbsp;Parthians at Carrhae, and in Rome the course of&nbsp;events slowly forced Pompey into an attitude of&nbsp;hostility to Caesar. The year 54 brought with it a&nbsp;renewal of the riotous anarchy which had disgraced&nbsp;Rome in 58-57. Conscious of its own helplessness, the senate,&nbsp;with the eager assent of all respectable citizens, dissuaded&nbsp;Pompey from leaving Italy; and he accordingly left his provinces to be governed by his legates. But the anarchy and&nbsp;confusion only grew worse, and even strict constitutionalists&nbsp;like Cicero talked of the necessity of investing Pompey with some&nbsp;extraordinary powers for the preservation of order.@@<sup>5</sup> At last</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font5">in 52 he was elected sole consul, and not only so, but his provincial command was prolonged for five years&nbsp;more, and fresh troops were assigned him.@@<sup>6</sup> The rôle&nbsp;of“ saviour of society ” thus thrust upon Pompey was&nbsp;one which flattered his vanity, but it entailed consequences which it is probable he did not foresee, for it brought&nbsp;him into close alliance with the senate, and in the senate there&nbsp;was a powerful party who were resolved to force him into heading the attack they could not successfully make without him&nbsp;upon Caesar. It was known that the latter, whose command&nbsp;expired in March 49, but who in the ordinary course&nbsp;of things would not have been replaced by his successor&nbsp;until January 48, was anxious to be allowed to stand&nbsp;for his second consulship in the autumn of 49 without coming&nbsp;in person to Rome.@@<sup>7</sup> His opponents in the senate&nbsp;were equally bent on bringing his command to an end&nbsp;at the legal time, and so obliging him to disband his&nbsp;troops and stand for the consulship as a private person,&nbsp;or, if he kept his command, on preventing his standing for&nbsp;the consulship. Through 51 and 50 the discussions&nbsp;in the senate and the negotiations with Caesar continued, but with no result. On 1st January 49 Caesar&nbsp;made a last offer of compromise. The senate replied by requiring him on pain of outlawry to disband his legions. Two&nbsp;tribunes who supported him were ejected from the senate-house,&nbsp;and the magistrates with Pompey were authorized to take&nbsp;measures to protect the republic. Caesar hesitated no longer;&nbsp;he crossed the Rubicon and invaded Italy. The&nbsp;rapidity of his advance astounded and bewildered&nbsp;his foes. Pompey, followed by the consuls, by the&nbsp;majority of the senate and a long train of nobles,&nbsp;abandoned Italy as untenable, and crossed into&nbsp;Greece@@.<sup>8</sup> At the end of March Caesar entered Rome as the&nbsp;master of Italy. Four years later, after the final victory of&nbsp;Munda (45), he became the undisputed master of the&nbsp;Roman world.@@<sup>9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font5">The task which Caesar had to perform was no easy one. It came upon him suddenly; for there is no sufficient reason&nbsp;to believe that Caesar had long premeditated revolution, or that he had previously aspired to anything&nbsp;more than such a position as that which Pompey had&nbsp;already won, a position unrepublican indeed, but&nbsp;accepted by republicans as inevitable.@@<sup>10</sup> War was&nbsp;forced upon him as the alternative to political suicide, hut&nbsp;success in war brought the responsibilities of nearly absolute&nbsp;power, and Caesar’s genius must be held to have shown&nbsp;itself in the masterly fashion in which he grasped the situation, rather than in the supposed sagacity with which he is&nbsp;said to have foreseen and prepared for it. In so far as he failed,&nbsp;his failure was mainly due to the fact that his tenure of power&nbsp;was too short for the work which he was required to perform.&nbsp;From the very first moment when Pompey’s ignominious&nbsp;retreat left him master of Italy, he made it clear that he was&nbsp;neither a second Sulla nor even the reckless anarchist which&nbsp;many believed him to be.@@<sup>11</sup> The Roman and Italian public were&nbsp;written about this time, which was based upon his hopes of what&nbsp;Pomoev micht Drove to </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">be : </span><span class="font5" style="font-style:italic;">Ad AU.</span><span class="font4"> viii. 1 </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">r !
