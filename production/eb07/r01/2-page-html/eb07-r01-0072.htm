<p><span class="font0">Nevertheless, he lived in the utmost splendour ; most of the eminent masters of his time were ambitious of working under him ; and he never went out without a crowd of artists&nbsp;and others, who followed him purely from respect. He&nbsp;was not only the best painter in the world, but perhaps the&nbsp;best architect too, on which account Leo X. charged him&nbsp;with building St Peter’s church at Rome ; but he was too&nbsp;much addicted to pleasure, which occasioned his death at&nbsp;the early age of thirty-seven.

<p><span class="font0">RAPHAIM, or Rephaim, a name signifying </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Giants,</span><span class="font0"> as they really were, and an actual people too, situated in Ba-san or Batanea, beyond Jordan, and separated from the Zan-zummim by the river Jabbok. Thià is also the name of a&nbsp;valley near Jemsalem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RÀPHANIDOSIS, a particular kind of punishment inflicted at Athens upon adulterers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAPIER, formerly signified a long old-fashioned sword, such as those worn by the common soldiers ; but it now denotes a small sword, as contradistinguished to a back-sword.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAPIN, Rene, a Jesuit and eminent French writer, was born at Tours in 1621. He taught polite literature in the&nbsp;society of the Jesuits with great applause, and was justly&nbsp;esteemed one of the best Latin poets and greatest wits of&nbsp;his time. He died at Paris in the year 1687. His principal works were, 1. A great number of Latin poems, which&nbsp;have rendered him famous throughout all Europe, amongst&nbsp;which are his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hortorum Iibri quatuor ;</span><span class="font0"> 2. Reflections on Eloquence, Poetry, History, and Philosophy ; 3. Comparisons&nbsp;between Virgil and Homer, Demosthenes and Cicero, Plato&nbsp;and Aristotle, Thucydides and Titus Livius ; 4. The History&nbsp;of Jansenism ; and, 5. Several works on religious subjects.&nbsp;The best edition of his Latin poems is that of Paris in 1723,&nbsp;in three vols, l2mo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rapin de Thoybas, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paul de,</span><span class="font0"> a celebrated historian, was the son of James de Rapin, lord of Thoyras, and was born&nbsp;at Castres in 1661. He was at first educated under a tutor&nbsp;in his father’s house, and afterwards sent to Puylaurens, and&nbsp;thence to Samur. In 1679 he returned to his father, with&nbsp;a design to apply himself to the study of the law<sup>r</sup>, and was&nbsp;admitted an advocate ; but some time afterwards, reflecting&nbsp;that his being a Protestant would prevent∙his advancement&nbsp;at the bar, he resolved to quit the profession of the law, and&nbsp;to apply himself to that of the sword. His father, however,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">, would not consent to the change. The revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685, and the death of his father, which&nbsp;happened two months afterwards, made him resolve to come&nbsp;to England ; but as he had no hopes of any settlement there,&nbsp;his stay was but short. He therefore went to Holland, and&nbsp;enlisted himself in the company of French volunteers at&nbsp;Utrecht, commanded by M. Rapin, his cousin-german. He&nbsp;attended the Prince of Orange into England in 1688 ; and&nbsp;the follow’ing year Lord Kingston made him an ensign in&nbsp;his regiment, with which he proceeded to Ireland, where he&nbsp;gained the esteem Ofhisofficers at the siege OfCarrickfergus,&nbsp;and soon received a lieutenant’s commission. He was present at the battle of the Boyne, and was shot through the&nbsp;shoulder at the siege of Limerick. He was soon afterwards&nbsp;made captain of the company in which he had been ensign ;&nbsp;but, in 1693, he resigned his company to one of his brothers,&nbsp;in order to become tutor to the Earl of Portland’s son. In&nbsp;1699, he married Marianne Testard ; but this marriage neither abated his care of his pupil, nor prevented his accompanying him in his travels. Having finished this employment, he returned to his family, which he had settled at the&nbsp;Hague ; and there he continued some years. But as he&nbsp;found his family increase, he resolved to retire to some cheap&nbsp;country ; and accordingly removed, in 1707, to Wesel, where&nbsp;he wrote his History of England, and some other works.&nbsp;Though he was of a strong constitution, yet seventeen ycars<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>application, for so long was he engaged in composing his&nbsp;.great work, entirely ruined his health. He died in 1725.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rapin wrote, in French, 1. A Dissertation on IheWhigsand Tories ; 2. His History of England, printed at the Hague in&nbsp;1726 and 1727, in nine vols. 4to, and reprinted at Trevoux&nbsp;in 1728, in ten vols. 4to. This' last edition is more complete&nbsp;than that of the Hague. It has been translated into English, and improved with notes, by Mr Tindal, in two vols.&nbsp;folio. This performance, although the work of a foreigner,&nbsp;is deservedly esteemed as the fullest and most impartial collection of English political transactions extant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAPPERSCHWEIL, a small city of Switzerland, in the canton of St Gall. It is fortified, and has a citadel, but&nbsp;the defences are at present in bad repair. It is situated near&nbsp;the head of the lake of Zurich, over an arm of which there&nbsp;is perhaps the longest bridge in the world, being 4800 feet&nbsp;in length, and only twelve feet in breadth. It is built of&nbsp;wood, and has no rail or balustrade on either side, so that&nbsp;the first entrance upon it is rather terrific to travellers in </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">carriage. The town is old and ill built, but without the&nbsp;walls the suburbs are delightful, and the soil in its immediate vicinity is very fruitful. Some machinery for spinning&nbsp;cotton has of late been erected. The population is about&nbsp;1550 persons, but rapidly increasing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAPPOLSTEIN, a town of France, in the department of the Upper Rhine, which, before the revolution, had the&nbsp;title of a barony. Long. 7. 28. E. Lat. 48. 15. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAREE, a town of Hindustan, on the sea-coast of the province of Bejapoor, seventeen miles north by west from&nbsp;Goa. Long. 73. 30. E. Lat- 15. 50. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAREFACTION, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Physics,</span><span class="font0"> the act by which a body is rendered rare ; that is, brought to occupy more room, or&nbsp;appear under a larger bulk, without accession of any new&nbsp;matter. This is very frequently the effect of heat, as has&nbsp;long been universally known. In many cases, however,&nbsp;philosophers have attributed it to the action of a repulsive&nbsp;principle. But, from the numerous discoveries concerning&nbsp;the nature and properties of the electric fluid and fire, there&nbsp;is the greatest reason to believe that this repulsive principle&nbsp;is no other than elementary fire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RASAY, one of the Western Islands or Hebrides, is about thirteen miles in length and two in breadth. It has plenty&nbsp;of limestone and freestone, feeds great numbers of black&nbsp;cattle, but has neither deers, hares, nor rabbits. The only&nbsp;appearance of a'harbour in Rasay is at Clachan Bay, where&nbsp;the proprietor of the island resides. Rasay presents a bold&nbsp;shore, which rises to the height of mountains ; and here the&nbsp;natives have with incredible labour formed many little cornfields and potato-grounds. These heights decrease at the&nbsp;southern extremity, where there are some farms and a good-looking country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAS EL KHYMA,a town of Arabia, OnthePersianGulf, situated on a sandy peninsula, the isthmus of which is defended by a battery, while the Sea-line is also fortified by&nbsp;batteries of one gun each at regular intervals. It has a&nbsp;suburb of bamboo huts, roofed with date-tree leaves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RASK, Erasmus, an eminent scholar and philologist, was born at Brendekild, in the island of Even, in the year 1784.&nbsp;He studied at the university of Copenhagen, and early distinguished himself by his singular talent for the acquisition&nbsp;of languages. In the year 1808, he was appointed assistant&nbsp;keeper of the University Library, and some years afterwards&nbsp;made professor of Literary History. In 1811, he published,&nbsp;in the Danish language, his Introduction to the Grammar ot&nbsp;the Icelandic and other Ancient Northern Languages, the&nbsp;materials of which were entirely derived from the immense&nbsp;mass of manuscript and printed works which had been accumulated by his predecessors in the same field of research.&nbsp;This grammar appears to have given a fresh impulse to the&nbsp;study of the ancient northern languages, even in Germany.&nbsp;The reputation which Rask acquired by it recommended him&nbsp;to the Arna-Magnæan Institution, by which he was employed as editor of the Icelandic Lexicon of Biorne Haldorsen,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
