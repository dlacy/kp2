Theſe games laſted three days and as many nights; during which time ſacriſices were performed, theatrical ſhews exhibited, with combats, ſports, &amp; c. in the circus. The occaſion of theſe games, according to Valerius Maximus, was to flop the progreſs of a plague. Valerius Publicola was the firſt who celebrated them at Rome in the year of the city 245. The ſolemnity was as follows: The whole world was invited by a herald to a feaſt which they had never ſeen already, nor ever ſhould ſee again. Some days before the games began, the quindecemviri in the Capitol and the Palatine temple, diſtributed to the people purifying compoſitions, of various kinds, as flambeaus, ſulphur, &amp; c. From hence the populace paſſed to Diana's temple on the Aventine mount, with wheat, barley, and oats, as an offering. After this, whole nights were ſpent in devotion to the Deſtinies. When the time of the games was fully come, the people aſſembled in the Campus Martius, and ſacrificed to Jupiter, Juno, Apollo, Latona, Diana, the Parcæ, Ceres, Pluto, and Proſerpine. On the firſt night oſ the feaſt the emperor, with the quindecemviri, cauſed three altars to be erected on the banks of the Tiber, which they ſprinkled with the blood of three lambs, and then proceeded to regular ſacrifice. A ſpace was next marked out for a theatre, which was illuminated with innumerable flambeaus and fires. Here they ſung hymns, and celebrated all kinds of ſports. On the day after, having offered victims at the Capitol, they went to the Campus Martius, and celebrated ſports to the honour of Apollo and Diana. Theſe laſted till next day, when the noble matrons, at the hour appointed by the oracle, went to the Capitol to ſing hymns to Jupiter. On the third day, which concluded the ſolemnity, twenty-ſeven boys, and as many girls, ſung, in the temple of Palatine Apollo hymns and verſes in Greek and Latin, to recommend the city to the protection of thoſe deities whom they deſigned particularly to honour by their facriſices.</p><p>The inimitable Carmen Seculare of Horace was compoſed for this laſt day, in the Secular Games, held by Auguſtus.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0246.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0240"/>
It has been much diſputed whether theſe games were held every hundred, or every hundred and ten years. Valerius Antius, Varro, and Livy, are quoted in ſupport of the former opinion: In favour of the latter may be produced the quindecemviral regiſters, the edicts of Auguſtus, and the words of Horace in the Secular poem,</p><p><hi rend="italic">Catus undenos decies per annos.</hi></p><p>It was a general belief, that the girls who bore a part in the ſong ſhould be ſooneſt married; and that the children who did not dance and fing at the coming of Apollo, ſhould die unmarried, and at an early period of life.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Secular</hi> <hi rend="italic">Poem,</hi> a poem ſung or rehearſed at the ſecular games; of which kind we have a very fine piece among the works of Horace, being a ſapphic ode at the end of his epodes.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
