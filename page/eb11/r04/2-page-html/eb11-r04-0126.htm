<p><span class="font1">a leader in order successfully to attack a government discredited by failure at home and abroad. With the return of Pompey&nbsp;from Spain their opportunity came. Pompey, who&nbsp;understood politics as little as Marius, was anxious&nbsp;to obtain a triumph, the consulship for the next&nbsp;year (70), and as the natural consequence of this&nbsp;an important command in the East. The opposition&nbsp;wanted his name and support, and a bargain was soon&nbsp;struck. Pompey and with him Marcus Licinius Crassus, the real&nbsp;conqueror of Spartacus, were elected consuls, almost in the&nbsp;presence of their troops, which lay encamped outside the gates&nbsp;in readiness to assist at the triumph and ovation granted to&nbsp;their respective leaders. Pompey lost no time in performing&nbsp;his part of the agreement. The tribunes regained their prerogatives.@@<sup>1</sup> The “ perpetual courts” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(quaestiones perpetuae)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">were taken out of the hands of the senatorial judices, who had&nbsp;outdone the equestrian order in scandalous corruption,@@<sup>2</sup> and&nbsp;finally the censors, the first since 86 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font1"> purged the senate of&nbsp;the more worthless and disreputable of Sulla’s partisans.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The victory was complete; but for the future its chief significance lay in the clearness with which it showed that the final decision in matters political lay with neither of the two great&nbsp;parties in Rome, but with the holder of the military authority.&nbsp;The tribunes ceased to be political leaders and became lieutenants of the military commanders, and the change was fatal&nbsp;to the dignity of politics in the city. Men became conscious&nbsp;of the unreality of the old constitutional controversies, indifferent to the questions which agitated the forum and the&nbsp;curia, and contemptuously ready to alter or disregard the&nbsp;constitution itself when it stood in the way of interests nearer&nbsp;to their hearts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When his consulship ended, Pompey impatiently awaited at the hands of the politicians he had befriended the further&nbsp;gift of a foreign command. He declined an ordinary&nbsp;province, and from the end of 70 to 67 he remained&nbsp;at Rome in a somewhat affectedly dignified seclusion.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>But in 67 and 66 the laws of Gabinius and Manilius&nbsp;gave him all and more than all that he expected (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pompey).</span><span class="font1"> By the former he obtained the sole command for three years against the Mediterranean pirates.@@<sup>5</sup> He&nbsp;was to have supreme authority over all Roman magistrates&nbsp;in the provinces throughout the Mediterranean and over the&nbsp;coasts for 50 miles inland. Fifteen legati, all of praetorian&nbsp;rank, were assigned to him, with two hundred ships, and as&nbsp;many troops as he thought desirable. The Manilian law transferred from Lucullus and Glabrio to Pompey the conduct of the&nbsp;Mithradatic War in Asia, and with it the entire control of Roman&nbsp;policy and interests in the East.@@<sup>6</sup> The unrepublican character&nbsp;of the position thus granted to Pompey, and the dangers of the&nbsp;precedent established, were clearly enough pointed out by&nbsp;such moderate men as Q. Lutatius Catulus, the “ father of the&nbsp;senate,” and by the orator Hortensius—but in vain. Both&nbsp;laws were supported, not only by the tribunes and the populace,&nbsp;but by the whole influence of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">publicani</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ncgotiatores,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">whose interests in the East were at stake.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pompey left Rome in 67. In a marvellously short space of time he freed the Mediterranean from the Cilician pirates&nbsp;and established Roman authority in Cilicia itself. He then&nbsp;crushed Mithradates, added Syria to the list of Roman provinces.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">and led the Roman legions to the Euphrates and the Caspian, leaving no power capable of disputing with Rome the sovereignty&nbsp;of western Asia.@@<sup>7</sup> He did not return to Italy till&nbsp;towards the end of 62. The interval was marked&nbsp;in Rome by the rise to political importance of Caesar and&nbsp;Cicero, and by Catiline’s attempt at revolution. As&nbsp;the nephew of Marius and the son-in-law of Cinna,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Caesar possessed a strong hereditary claim to the leadership of the popular and Marian party.@@<sup>8</sup> He had already&nbsp;taken part in the agitation for the restoration of the tribunate;&nbsp;he had supported the Manilian law; and, when Pompey’s&nbsp;withdrawal left the field clear for other competitors, he stepped&nbsp;at once into the front rank on the popular side.@@<sup>9</sup> He took upon&nbsp;himself, as their nearest representative, the task of clearing&nbsp;the memory and avenging the wrongs of the great popular&nbsp;leaders, Marius, Cinna and Satuminus. He publicly reminded&nbsp;the people of Marius’s services, and set up again upon the&nbsp;Capitol the trophies of the Cimbric War. He endeavoured to&nbsp;bring to justice, not only the ringleaders in Sulla’s bloody work&nbsp;of proscription, but even the murderers of Satuminus, and vehemently pleaded the cause of the children of the proscribed.&nbsp;While thus carrying on in genuine Roman fashion the feud of&nbsp;his family, he attracted the sympathies of the Italians by his&nbsp;efforts to procure the Roman franchise for the Latin communities&nbsp;beyond the Po, and won the affections of the populace in Rome&nbsp;and its immediate neighbourhood by the splendour of the&nbsp;games which he gave as curule aedile (65), and by his&nbsp;lavish expenditure upon the improvement of the&nbsp;Appian Way. But these measures were with him only means&nbsp;to the further end of creating for himself a position such as that&nbsp;which Pompey had already won; and this ulterior aim he&nbsp;pursued with an audacious indifference to constitutional forms&nbsp;and usages. His coalition with Crassus, soon after Pompey’s&nbsp;departure, secured him an ally whose colossal wealth and wide&nbsp;financial connexions were of inestimable value, and whose&nbsp;vanity and inferiority of intellect rendered him a* willing tool.&nbsp;The story of his attempted </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">coup d'&amp;at</span><span class="font1"> in January 65 is&nbsp;probably false,@@<sup>10</sup> but it is evident that by the beginning&nbsp;of 63 he was bent on reaping the reward of his exertions&nbsp;by obtaining from the people an extraordinary command&nbsp;abroad, which should secure his position before Pompey’s&nbsp;return; and the agrarian law proposed early that year by the&nbsp;tribune P. Servilius Rullus had for its object the creation,&nbsp;in favour of Caesar and Crassus, of a commission with powers&nbsp;so wide as to place its members almost on a level with Pompey&nbsp;himself.@@<sup>11</sup> It was at this moment when all seemed going well,&nbsp;that Caesar’s hopes were dashed to the ground by Catiline’s&nbsp;desperate outbreak, which not only discredited every one&nbsp;connected with the popular party, but directed the suspicions&nbsp;of the well-to-do classes against Caesar himself, as a possible&nbsp;accomplice in Catiline’s revolutionary schemes@@<sup>12</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same wave of indignation and suspicion which for the moment checked Caesar’s rise carried Marcus Tullius Cicero to&nbsp;the height of his fortunes. Cicero, as a politician, has&nbsp;been equally misjudged by friends and foes. That&nbsp;he was deficient in courage, that he was vain, and that he&nbsp;attempted the impossible, may be admitted at once. But he&nbsp;was neither a brilliant and unscrupulous adventurer nor an&nbsp;aimless trimmer, nor yet a devoted champion merely of senatorial</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
