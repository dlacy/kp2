<p><span class="font1">(see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Screen),</span><span class="font1"> which divides the chancel or the choir from the nave. The rood was carried either on a transverse beam, the&nbsp;“ rood beam,” or by a gallery, the “ rood loft.” Such a&nbsp;gallery was also used as a place from which to read portions&nbsp;of the service (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jubé).</span><span class="font1"> It was reached by the “ rood stair,”&nbsp;a small winding stair or “ vice.” In English churches these&nbsp;stairs generally run up in a small turret in the wall at the west&nbsp;end of the chancel; often this also leads out on to the roof.&nbsp;On the continent of Europe they often lead out of the interior&nbsp;■of the church and are enclosed with tracery, as at Rouen or&nbsp;Strassburg. “ Rood stairs ” remain in many English churches&nbsp;where the rood loft has been destroyed. A fine example of a&nbsp;rood loft is at Charlton-on-Otmoor, Oxfordshire. The screen&nbsp;might be separate from the rood beam or rood loft. The&nbsp;general construction of wooden screens is close panelling beneath, on which stands screen-work composed of slender turned&nbsp;balusters or regular wooden mullions, supporting tracery&nbsp;more or less rich with cornices, crestings, &amp;c., and often painted&nbsp;in brilliant colours and gilded. The central tower of a church&nbsp;over the intersection of the nave and chancel with the transepts&nbsp;is sometimes called the “ rood tower ”; an example is that at&nbsp;Notre Dame at Paris. In England rood lofts do not appear&nbsp;to have been introduced before the 14th century, and were not&nbsp;common till the 15th. The “roods” themselves were not</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">disturbed in Henry VIII.’s reign, but were generally removed under Edward VI. and Elizabeth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The legality of rood screens or rood lofts in the Church of England depends on the law of the Church with regard to&nbsp;images, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e. “</span><span class="font1"> whether they do or do not, or will or will not,&nbsp;encourage or lead to idolatrous or superstitious worship in the&nbsp;place where they are, or are to be put ” (Lindley, L. 7. in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. v.&nbsp;Bishop of London,</span><span class="font1"> 1889, 24 Q.B.D. 213, 237; see also </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">St&nbsp;John Timbcrhill, Norwich,</span><span class="font1"> case, 1889 Prob. 71, and article&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Image).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROOFS. A roof is a construction placed as a covering over the upper portion of a building to exclude the weather and&nbsp;preserve the contents dry and uninjured. Roofs are designed&nbsp;to throw off rain and snow, and their slope or “ pitch,” as it is&nbsp;generally termed, is governed to a great extent by the climate,&nbsp;as well as by the material used and manner of laying. The&nbsp;pitch may vary from an almost horizontal surface (as largely&nbsp;adopted in dry countries and also in temperate climates for&nbsp;roofs of metal or asphalt) to the steeply pitched roofs required&nbsp;for the ordinary flat tiles which to be weatherproof must be laid&nbsp;at an angle of from 45° to 8o° with the horizon. Besides serving&nbsp;the useful purpose of protection against inclement weather the&nbsp;roof, both externally and internally, may be designed to form&nbsp;an architectural feature in keeping with the character of he&nbsp;building.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The simplest form is the “ flat roof ” consisting of horizontal wood joists laid from wall to wall as in floor construction.&nbsp;The roof must not be quite flat, for a slight fall is&nbsp;necessary in its upper surface to allow water to drain&nbsp;away into gutters placed at convenient points. The&nbsp;joists are covered with a waterproof material such as asphalt,&nbsp;lead, zinc or copper, the three last materials being usually laid&nbsp;upon boarding, which stiffens the structure and forms a good&nbsp;surface to fix the weatherproof covering upon. Such roofs&nbsp;are not suitable for cold climates, for accumulations of snow&nbsp;might overburden the structure and would also cause the wet&nbsp;to penetrate through any small crevices and under flashings.&nbsp;With flat roofs the pressure exerted upon the supports is directly&nbsp;vertical.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>a</sup> Lean-to,” “ shed,” or “ pent ” roofs are practically developments of the flat roof, one end of the joists (which are now called “ rafters ”) being tipped up to form a decided slope,&nbsp;which enables slates, tiles, corrugated iron and other materials&nbsp;to be employed which cannot be used upon a <sup>11</sup> flat *” roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Simple roofs in general use with a double slope are the “ coupled rafter roofs,” the rafters meeting at the-highest ¡joint&nbsp;upon a horizontal ridge-piece which stiffens the framework and&nbsp;gives a level ridge-line. In some old roofs the rafters are connected&nbsp;without any intervening ridge-plate, with the result that after</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">a time the ridge instead of remaining level takes on a wavy outline, due to the fact that some of the timbers have settled slightly owing to decay or other causes, whilst others have&nbsp;remained firm in their places. The lower ends of the rafters&nbsp;should pitch on a wood plate bedded on the top of the wall;&nbsp;this, as described under </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Carpentry,</span><span class="font1"> assists in spreading the&nbsp;weight over a large area of the wall, and provides good fixing for&nbsp;the timbers. The simple <sup>u</sup> couple roof ” consists merely of two&nbsp;sets of rafters pitched from plates on the walls on either side&nbsp;of the building and sloping upwards to rest against a common&nbsp;ridge-piece. There are no ties between the feet of the rafters,&nbsp;which therefore exert a considerable thrust against the supporting walls. On account of this and of the lack of rigidity of the&nbsp;framing this form of roof should only be used to cover small&nbsp;spans of 10 to 12 ft. Generally the ends of the rafters are connected by ceiling joists which form a level ceiling and at the&nbsp;same time prevent any outward thrust on the supports. When&nbsp;used for spans between 12 ft. and 18 ft. a binder supported&nbsp;by an iron or wood “king” tie every 5 or 6 ft. should be run&nbsp;along across the centres of the ceiling joists and the latter spiked&nbsp;to it. Such roofs with the wood tie across the feet of the&nbsp;rafters are termed “ couple close roofs.” When the ties are&nbsp;fixed about half-way up the rafters it is called a “ collar roof,”&nbsp;and may be used for spans up to 16 ft. These are the type of&nbsp;roof commonly used in ordinary dwelling-houses where the</span></p>
