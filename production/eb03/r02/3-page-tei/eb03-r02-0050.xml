The veſſels were about 10 inches deep, and the branches FG, <hi rend="italic">f</hi><hi rend="italic">g</hi>  of the ſyphon were about five feet long. The veſſels were ſet on two tables of equal height, and (the hole <hi rend="italic">e</hi>  being flopped) the veſſel ABCD, and the whole ſyphon, were filled with water, and water was poμred into the veſſel <hi rend="italic">abed</hi>  till it ſtood at a certain height LM. The ſyphon was then turned into a horizontal poſition, and the plug drawn out of <hi rend="italic">e, </hi>and the time -carefully noted which the water employed in riſing to the level f!KI <hi rend="italic">h</hi>  in both veſſels. The whole apparatus was now inclined, ſo that the water run back into ABCD. The ſyphon was now put in a vertical poſition, and the experiment was repeated. —No ſenſible or regular difference was obſerved in the time. Yet in this experiment the preſſure on the part Gg of the ſyphon was more than fix times greater than before. As it was thought that the friction on this ſmall part (only fix inches) was too ſmall a portion of the whole obſtruction, various additional obſtructions were put into this part of the ſyphon, and it was even lengthened to nine feet ; but ſtill no remarkable difference was obſerved. It was even thought that the times were leſs when the ſyphon was vertical.</p><p>Thus Mr De Buat’s opinion is completely juſtified ; and he may be allowed to aſſert, that the reſiſtance depends chiefly on the relation between the ſection and</p><p>its border ; and that —--<hi rend="sup">wz</hi>*⅞- ſhould be a conſtant quan-√a</p><p>tity.</p><p>To aſcertain this point was the object of the next ſe-ries of experiments ; to ſee whether this quantity was really conſtant, and, if not, to diſcover the law of its variation, and the phyſical circumſtances which accompanied the variations, and may therefore be conſidered as their cauſes. A careful compariſon of a very great number of experiments, made with the ſame Hope, and with very different channels and velocities, ſhowed that ∖<hi rend="italic">f </hi><hi rend="italic">m g</hi>  did not follow the proportion of <hi rend="italic">V d,</hi>  nor of any power of 5/ J. This quantity <hi rend="italic">ſmg</hi>  increaſed by ſmaller degrees in proportion as <hi rend="italic">f d</hi>  was greater. In very great beds was nearly proportional to <hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi>  but in ſmaller channels, the velocities diminiſhed much more than <hi rend="italic">\ſ </hi><hi rend="italic">d</hi>  did. Caſting about for ſome way of accommodation, Mr Buat conſidered, that ſome approximation at leaſt would be had by taking off from <hi rend="italic">d</hi>  ſome conſtant ſmall quantity. This is evident : For ſuch a diminution will have but a trifling effect when ¼∕ <hi rend="italic">d</hi>  is great, and its effect will increaſe rapidly when <hi rend="italic">\ſ d</hi>  is very ſmall. He therefore tried various values for this ſubtraction, and compared the reſults with the former experiments ; and he found, that if in</p><lb/><p>every caſe √ <hi rend="italic">d</hi>  be diminiſhed by oneſtenth of an inch, the calculated diſcharges would agree very exactly with the experiment. Therefore, inſtead of √ <hi rend="italic">d,</hi>  he makes uſe of <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">λ∕ d —</hi></hi>  O,ι, and finds this quantity always proportional to or finds that <hi rend="sup">l</hi>"∕<hi rend="sup">m</hi>Jl.--is a con-</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps"><hi rend="sup">i</hi>    √J-o,i</hi></p><p>ftant quantity, or very nearly ſo. It varied from 297 to 287 in all fictions from that of a very ſmall pipe to that of a little canal. In the large fictions of canals and rivers it diminiſhed ſtill more, but never was leſs than 2y6.</p><p>This reſult is very agreeable to the moſt diſtinct notions that we can form of the mutual actions of the water and its bed. <hi rend="italic">We</hi>  fie, that when the motion of water is obſtructed by a ſolid body, which deflects the paſſing filaments, the diſturbance does not extend to any conſiderable diſtance on the two ſides of the body. In like manner, the ſmall diſturbances, and imperceptible curvilineal motions, which are occaſioned by the infiniteſimal inequalities of the channel, muſt extend to a very ſmall diſtance indeed from the ſides and bottom of the channel. We know, too, that the mutual adheſion or attraction of water for the ſolid bodies which are moiſtened by it, extends to a very ſmall diſtance ; which is probably the ſame, or nearly ſo, in all cafis. Mr Buat obſerved, that a ſurface of 23 ſquare inches, applied to the ſurface of ſtagnant water, lifted 1601 grains ; another of <hi rend="italic">5</hi>4 ſquare inches lifted 365 : this was at the rate of 65 grains per inch nearly, making a column of about one-ſixth of an inch high. Now this effect is very much analogous to a real contraction of the capacity of the channel. The water may be conceived as nearly ſtagnant to this ſmall diſtance from the border of the fiction. Or, to ſpeak more accurately, the diminution of the progreſſive velocity occaſioned by the friction and adheſion of the ſides, decreaſes very rapidly as we recede from the ſides, and ceaſes to be ſenſible at a very ſmall diſtance.</p><p>The writer of this article verified this by a very ſimple and inſtructive experiment. He was. making experiments on the production of vortices, in the manner ſuggeſted by SirlſaacNewton, by whirling a very accurate andſmooth-ly poliſhed cylinder in water; and he found that the rapid motion of the ſurrounding water was confined to an exceeding ſmall diſtance from the cylinder, and it was not till after many revolutions that it was ſenſible even at the diſtance of half an inch. We may, by the way, ſuggeſt this as the beſt form of experiments for examining the reſiſtances of pipes. The motion excited by the whirling cylinder in the ſtagnant water is equal and oppoſite to the motion loft by water paſſing along a ſurface equal to that of the cylinder with the ſame velocity. Be this as it may, we are juſtified in conſidering, with Mr Buat, the ſection of the ſtream as thus diminiſhed by cutting off a narrow border all round the touching parts, and ſuppoſing that the motion and diſcharge is the ſame as if the root of the mean depth of the ſection were diminiſhed by a ſmall quantity, nearly conſtant. We ſee, too, that the effect of this muſt be infinſible in great canals and rivers ; ſo that, fortunately, its quantity is beſt aſcertained by experiments made with ſmall pipes. This is attended with another con« veniency, in the opinion of Mr Buat, namely, that the</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
