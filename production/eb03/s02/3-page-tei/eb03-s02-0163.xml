He alſo exhorts the Chriſtians not to a<hi rend="italic">ſſo</hi>ciate with any perſon who led ſuch an openly profane life,</p><p>3. He cenſures the Corinthians for their litigious diſpo<hi rend="italic">ſi</hi>tion, which cauſed them to proſecute their Chri<hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>tian brethren before the Heathen courts. He expre<hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi>es much warmth and ſurpriſe that they did not refer their differences to their brethren; and concludes his exhortations on this ſubject, by aſſuring them that they ought rather to allow themſelves to be defrauded than to ſeek redreſs from Heathens (chap. v. 1—9).</p><p>4. He inveighs againſt thoſe vices to which the Corinthians had been addicted before their converſion, and eſpecially againſt fornication, the criminality of which they did not fully perceive, as this vice was generally overlooked in the ſy<hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>tems of the philoſophers, (ch. vi. 10. to the end).</p><p>Having thus pointed out the public irregularities with which they were chargeable, he next replies to certain queſtions which the Corinthians had propoſed to him by letter. He, I. Determines ſome queſtions relating to the marriage ſtate; as, 1<hi rend="italic">ſt</hi>, Whether it was good to marry under the exiſting circumſtances of the church? And, 2d, Whether they ſhould withdraw from their partners if they continued unbelievers? (ch. vii).</p><p>2. He inſtructs them how to act with reſpect to idol offerings. It could not be unlawful in itſelf to eat the food which had been offered to idols; for the conſecration of fleſh or wine to an idol did not make it the property of the idol, an idol being nothing, and therefore incapable of property. But ſome Corinthians thought it lawful to go to a feaſt in the idol temples, which at the ſame time were places of reſort for lewdneſs, and to eat the ſacriſices whilſt praiſes were ſung to the idol. This was publicly joining in the idolatry. He even adviſes to abſtain from ſuch participation as was lawful, rather than give offence to a weak brother; which he enforces by his own example, who had abſtained from many lawful things, rather than prove a ſcandal to the goſpel, (chap. viii. ix. x.)</p><p>3. He anſwers a third query concerning the manner in which women ſhould deliver any thing in public, when called to it by a divine impulſe. And here he cenſures the unuſual dreſs of both ſexes in propheſying, which expoſed them to the contempt of the Greeks, among whom the men uſually went uncovered and the women veiled.</p><p>Being thus led to the conſideration of the abuſes that prevailed in their public worſhip, he goes on to cenſure the irregularities which were committed at their love-feaſts, or, as we term them, the <hi rend="italic">Lord’s Supper.</hi> It was a common practice with the Greeks at their <hi rend="italic">ſo</hi>cial ſuppers for every man to bring his own proviſions along with him, not, however, to ſhare them with the company, but to feaſt upon them in a ſolitary manner. Thus the rich ate and drank to exceſs, while the poor were totally neglected. The Corinthians introduced the ſame practice in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, thus confounding it with their ordinary meals, and without ever examining into the end of the inſtitution. It was this groſs abuſe that Paul reproves in the 11th chapter. He alſo cenſures their conduct in the exerciſe of the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghoſt; he <hi rend="italic">ſh</hi>ows them they all proceeded from the ſame ſpirit, and</p><p>were intended for the inſtruction of Chriſtian <hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>ocieties; that all Chriſtians ought to be united in mutual love; and that tenderneſs ought to be ſhown to the moſt incon<hi rend="italic">ſi</hi>derable member, as every one is ſubſervient to the good of the whole (chap. xii). In the 13th chapter he gives a beautiful deſcription of benevolence, which has been much and juſtly admired. He repreſents it as ſuperior to the ſupernatural gifts of the ſpirit, to the moſt exalted genius, to univerſal knowledge, and even to faith. In the 14th chapter he cautions the Corinthians againſt oſtentation in the exerci<hi rend="italic">ſ</hi>e of the gift of languages, and gives them proper advices.</p><p>4. He a<hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi>erts the reſurrection of the dead, in oppoſition to ſome of the Corinthians who denied it, founding it upon the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, which he conſiders as one of the moſt effential doctrines of Chriſtianity. He then anſwers ſome objections to the reſurrection, drawn from our not being capable of under<hi rend="italic">ſt</hi>anding how it will be accompliſhed, (chap, xv.) He then concludes with ſome directions to the Corinthian church concerning the manner of collecting alms; promiſes them a viſit, and ſalutes ſome of the members.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">ſe</hi>cond Epiſtle to the Corinthians was written from Macedonia in the year 57, about a year after the former. See 2 Cor. ix. 1—5. viii. and xiii. 1.</p><p>St Paul’s firſt Epiſtle had wrought different effects among the Corinthians: many of them examined their conduct; they excommunicated the inceſtuous man; requeſted St Paul’s return with tears; and vindicated him and his office againſt the falſe teacher and his adherents. Others of them <hi rend="italic">ſti</hi>ll adhered to that adversary of St Paul, expreſsly denied his apoſtolic office, and even furniſhed themſelves with pretended arguments from that Epiſtle. He had formerly promiſed to take a journey from Epheſus to Corinth, thence to viſit the Macedonians, and return from them to Corinth (2 Cor. i. 15, 16). But the unhappy ſtate of the Corinthian church made him alter his intention (verſe 23.), ſince he found he muſt have treated them with ſeverity. Hence his adversaries partly argued, 1. That St Paul was irreſolute and unſteady, and therefore could not be a prophet: 2. The improbability of his ever coming to Corinth again, ſince he was afraid of them. Such was the ſtate of the Corinthian church when St Paul, after his departure from Epheſus, having vi<hi rend="italic">ſi</hi>ted Macedonia, (Acts XX. 1.) received an account of the above particulars from Titus (2 Cor. vii. 5,6.), and therefore wrote them his ſecond Epiſtle about the end of the ſame year, or the beginning of 58.</p><p>But to give a more di<hi rend="italic">ſt</hi>inct view of the contents of this Epiſtle:</p><p>1. The apoſtle, after a general ſalutation, expre<hi rend="italic">ſſ</hi>es his grateful ſenſe of the divine goodneſs; profeſſing his confidence in God, ſupported by a ſenſe of his own integrity; makes an apology for not having viſited the Corinthians as he had intended, and vindicates himſelf from the charge of ſickleneſs, (chap. i).</p><p>2.He ſorgives the inceſtuous man, whoſe conduct had made ſo deep an impreſſiou on the apoſtle’s mind, that one reaſon why he had deferred his journey to Corinth was, that he might not meet them in grief, nor till he had received advice of the effect of his apoſtolical admonitions. He mentions his anxiety to meet Titus at Troas, in order to hear of their welfare; expreſſes</p></body></text></TEI>
