<p><span class="font2">parallel from N.E. to S.W., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> Catalanian on the coast of the Mediterranean, akin to Provençal, Spanish in the centre, Galician-Portuguese on the Atlantic. From the historical point of view one&nbsp;part might be called Gothic-Romance, the other Suevo-Romance.&nbsp;But the national and linguistic history of the times and countries&nbsp;we are dealing with is still very obscure. The difference between&nbsp;the two idioms is chiefly one of phonetics, while in their morphology and vocabulary they do not greatly differ. Spanish may be&nbsp;described as a language which favours vowels at the expense of&nbsp;consonants, and which therefore shows, more than other Romance&nbsp;languages, a weakening even of initial consonants. It changes&nbsp;voiced stops first to fricatives,- then to mere noises or “ burrs ”&nbsp;which finally disappear altogether, and s before a consonant or&nbsp;finally, becomes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font2"> (through a middle stage J) and is finally lost.&nbsp;The preferential treatment of vowels, however, entailed not a single&nbsp;change except that $ was changed to the diphthong </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ie, o</span><span class="font2"> to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ue;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">all else were preserved, e.g. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dies (decern), iicmpo (Umpus)<sub>i</sub> bueno&nbsp;(bonus) MuerU (forlis);</span><span class="font2"> but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">haver (habere), lid (liU), corona (corona),&nbsp;kumo (Jumus).. </span><span class="font2">The weakness of the initial sound is shown in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">enero (Januaruis)<sub>t</sub> hazer (Jacere)<sub>t</sub> llamar (clamare</span><span class="font2"> Withatransitional&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">elyarnar), Uaga (plaga),</span><span class="font2"> &amp;c. The written language has no sign for&nbsp;voiced plosives between vowels, but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">-alho</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">-ao</span><span class="font2"> is spread over nearly&nbsp;the whole region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In contrast to Spanish, Portuguese has a strong pronunciation of initial sounds, and so does not go bey</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">QndJaneiroMazer,</span><span class="font2"> and changes&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cl</span><span class="font2"> (with transitional form </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cly, ky),</span><span class="font2"> and afso </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pl</span><span class="font2"> (via </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ply, py)</span><span class="font2"> to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eh,&nbsp;e.g. Chamar, chaga.</span><span class="font2"> On the other hand, it has a careless articulation&nbsp;of vowels and consonants, and consequently no diphthongs. The&nbsp;unaccented vowels are weakened, as finals almost to vanishing&nbsp;point. It shows further a fusion of nasals with the preceding vowel,&nbsp;so as to form a nasal vowel, and this new nasality takes the colour&nbsp;of the preceding vowel, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. vina</span><span class="font2"> becomes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">vinho,</span><span class="font2"> but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">una</span><span class="font2"> becomes&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uma<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> otherwise before a vowel the nasal finally disappears; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cheio&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cheia<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plenus, plena.</span><span class="font2"> Similarly </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font2"> was lost between vowels,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. ceo (caelum);</span><span class="font2"> before consonants it became </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I,</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">u, e.g. outro&nbsp;(alUru), caldo (calidu).</span><span class="font2"> Voiced plosives have a weak pronunciation&nbsp;between vowels, and these are sometimes made fricatives. In&nbsp;relation to the somewhat careless articulation we note a marked&nbsp;reaction on accented vowels by the final vowel </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g. novo</span><span class="font2"> has a&nbsp;close vowel, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nova</span><span class="font2"> an open one), and also by the following consonants :&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span class="font2"> velarizes, i palatalizes preceding sounds, hence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">estas</span><span class="font2"> pronounced&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">istas,</span><span class="font2"> “ thou art,” with reduced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i,</span><span class="font2"> but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">devedor (debitor),</span><span class="font2"> “ debtor,”&nbsp;with reduced e. Lastly, the division between words is not sharp—the&nbsp;interaction of initial sounds and finals being very striking. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Devedor&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">has a plosive </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">d, a devedor</span><span class="font2"> has a fricative; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">istas</span><span class="font2"> has a breathed -r,&nbsp;but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">istas nos Ceus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font2"> “ thou art in heaven,” has a voiced -s; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seja,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">“ be,” has a reduced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a; o nome</span><span class="font2"> is pronounced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">u nome,</span><span class="font2"> but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">seja o&nbsp;nome</span><span class="font2"> is pronounced </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sej o nome,</span><span class="font2"> with an open </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span class="font2"> from α+o, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The separation of Gaul took place likewise in the second half of the 5th century, when the Visigoths had settled down in the south,&nbsp;the Burgundians in the east, and the Franks in the north. The&nbsp;type of language that was evolved here is distinct from Spanish&nbsp;primarily and principally in the loss of final vowels.except </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a,</span><span class="font2"> or, when&nbsp;the formation of the word was incompatible with this loss, in a&nbsp;weakening to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font2"> On the other hand, the declension is strongly&nbsp;conservative. Nowhere are the old case-endings so clearly preserved&nbsp;as in this region, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. reis, &quot;</span><span class="font2"> king,” but </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">la rei fille (regi filia), <sup>u</sup></span><span class="font2"> the&nbsp;king’s daughter </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">veil le rei, <sup>ii</sup>Videt regem dunet le rei, “ donat&nbsp;(dat) regi</span><span class="font2"> , these are the modes of expression, and they last till&nbsp;far into the literary period. But at an early stage there was a&nbsp;breach between the Franks of the north and the Burgundians of&nbsp;the east on the one hand, and the Visigoths </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">the south on the other.&nbsp;For while the latter (the Visigoths) retained the old system of&nbsp;accented vowels, the former changed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2"> to a diphthong </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ie, o</span><span class="font2"> became&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">uo, ue,</span><span class="font2"> and moreover </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ë</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font2"> became </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ei, o</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ü</span><span class="font2"> became </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ou ; a</span><span class="font2"> was&nbsp;changed to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">d, </span><span class="font2">assuming that these vowels were long in accordance&nbsp;with the later Latin pronunciation, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Lat. debere &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nepote&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pede&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mola&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pratu</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">North Fr. deveir &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nevout&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;piet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;muele&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prêt</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">South Fr. dever &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nebot&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mola&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prat</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The northern group, moreover, weakened the consonants still further. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">g,</span><span class="font2"> secondary consonants from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c,</span><span class="font2"> disappear&nbsp;like the primary ones, and thus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">praUllus</span><span class="font2"> becomes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">preau,</span><span class="font2"> S. Fr.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pradel ; advocatus</span><span class="font2"> becomes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">avoué,</span><span class="font2"> S. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">avogat;</span><span class="font2"> a secondary </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(from £&gt;) becomes </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">v,</span><span class="font2"> as we see by the form which replaces </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nepos&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">above. If we are right in ascribing this to the effort to stress the&nbsp;accented vowel at the expense of the other constituents of the word,&nbsp;we may take this to be connected with the weakening of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font2"> where&nbsp;final, and between two accented syllables, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> N Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aime</span><span class="font2"> from&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">amat,</span><span class="font2"> as against S. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ama;</span><span class="font2"> or in one case </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">armeure</span><span class="font2"> (Mod. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">armure),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">in the other </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">armadura,</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">armatura.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Parallel to the preservation of -i on the one hand, and the close following of the old flexions on the other, we find the type </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">membra&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">preserved at first, though not spreading, whereas the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Umpora-type&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">is abandoned. In the verb the variety in Latin perfect forms&nbsp;is still fairly well preserved, though there is a distinct extension&nbsp;of the «-perfect and the dedi-perfect. As we might expect, the&nbsp;vocabulary seems to be strongly, coloured by Germanic elements of&nbsp;Frankish, Burgundian and Gotnic origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Raetic dialects, in their prehistoric phase, are less clear than others. Their contact, at an age nearing the Carolingian, with&nbsp;the. French of the south-east in Valais seems to have caused a&nbsp;similar process of growth, especially as they change </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">o</span><span class="font2"> into&nbsp;the diphthongs </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ei</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ou,</span><span class="font2"> leaving at the. same time the consonants&nbsp;more intact. At an early stage the inroads of the migrating&nbsp;nations cut off Raetia from the Po valley, and the pressure of the&nbsp;German tribes severed its union with the Romance-speaking nations&nbsp;of the west. Thus isolated it was free to follow its own course.&nbsp;This language also preserved at first the three cases and the type&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">membra,</span><span class="font2"> the latter being developed later freely in use as a collective&nbsp;plural. But its further development was checked by the Lombards&nbsp;and Venetians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But the most difficult problems are those that arise in Italy. Though one may say generally that the dialects of the region of tne&nbsp;Po<sub>1</sub> and those of Liguria, belong to the types of north and western&nbsp;Romance, that is to say that the breathed plosives bctw'ecn vowels&nbsp;became voiced, yet they approach the typically Italian groups by&nbsp;their loss of -s. This means that when tne whole Italian peninsula&nbsp;was separated from Gaul as well as from Iberia (after the close of&nbsp;the 5th.century) and became again one homogeneous whole, the&nbsp;forms without J found their way into the north of ltaly only slowly,&nbsp;so that i has remained in the west, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> in Piedmont, in monosyllabic words to this day, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. as,</span><span class="font2"> “ thou hast,” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ses,</span><span class="font2"> “ thou art ”;&nbsp;the same rule prevailed in older times in the east, in Venice, and there&nbsp;the.</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span class="font2"> was also preserved (in questions) in polysyllabic words, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;venis-tu,</span><span class="font2"> “comest thou?”; and the old form maintained itself in&nbsp;Milanese in the single form </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sistu,</span><span class="font2"> “ art thou ?” To the loss of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">we trace the extinction of declensions, but as its action began&nbsp;to take effect later, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">membra-lype</span><span class="font2"> gained little footing, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Umpor</span><span class="font2">u-type none at all. In the vocabulary the Lombard elements&nbsp;are numerous, extending, like the supremacy of the Lombards,&nbsp;over the whole peninsula. It may be that 5 was lost under the&nbsp;influence of central Italy acting on the north. If so, we may surmise&nbsp;that a similar influence has changed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cl, pl,</span><span class="font2"> and· fl to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">cni, pi, fi&nbsp;(chiamare, pianta, fiamma).</span><span class="font2"> For it is precisely this point that&nbsp;differentiates both the Raetic dialects and Provençal from the&nbsp;contiguous Italian dialects, and the change certainly took place&nbsp;only </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">afUr</span><span class="font2"> the latter were completely detached. On the other hand&nbsp;the Italian vocabulary has been strongly influenced by the north,&nbsp;especially in Tuscany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The rise and development of the Romance Ianguages<sub>j</sub> in its large outline, appeals to the imagination as a vast historical&nbsp;phenomenon closely bound up with the fate of nations. One&nbsp;other element must not be overlooked on which we have touched&nbsp;more than once in the above sketch, for it bears so directly on the&nbsp;Romance vocabulary as to deserve the tribute of a general survey:&nbsp;this is the Germanic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">When mercenaries of Germanic origin pervaded the Roman armies, Germanic words found their way first into the language&nbsp;of the eamp, and thence into the vulgar language generally. And&nbsp;at that stage perhaps many words may actually have been imported which were, partly at any rate, lost again later.. Roman&nbsp;and Greek authors admit a considerable number of Germanic&nbsp;words, including terms belonging to warfare, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. bandum,</span><span class="font2"> “ standard,” used by Procopius, which still continues in the form of&nbsp;O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ban,</span><span class="font2"> Ital. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bandiera,</span><span class="font2"> Sp. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bandera,</span><span class="font2"> &amp;c. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Brutis<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font2"> “ bride,”&nbsp;“ daughter-in-law,” which occurs frequently in inscriptions, may&nbsp;date from the period of camp life, but for the rest it is retained&nbsp;only in Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bru,</span><span class="font2"> and in Friuli and Dalmatia. On the other hand,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Companio</span><span class="font2"> is clearly a Latinization of Gothic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ga-hlaifa,</span><span class="font2"> the meaning&nbsp;of which carries us back to the same sphere. Other old words&nbsp;express ideas of culture, or names of animals which the Romans&nbsp;learned to know in the German-speaking north, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. ganta,</span><span class="font2"> ” wild&nbsp;goose” (in Pliny), O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ganU,</span><span class="font2"> Prov. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ganta;</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">taxo,</span><span class="font2"> “badger,”&nbsp;Ital. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tassone,</span><span class="font2"> Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">taisson,</span><span class="font2"> Sp. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ujon.</span><span class="font2"> But the impression made was&nbsp;not pronounced until the age of the Germanic invasions, and then&nbsp;we find a great variety in the various Romance countries. In&nbsp;Italy we have two invasions to consider—by the Goths, and by the&nbsp;Lombards. But the destruction of the rule of the Lombards by&nbsp;Charlemagne, and the introduction of Frankish elements consequent upon it, should not be considered under the same head,&nbsp;since these Franks may themselves have been a Romance-speaking&nbsp;tribe. Goths as well as Lombards have left a. trail as noticeable&nbsp;in the language as elsewhere. Thus w'e find </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font2">several instances&nbsp;some uncertainty as between </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font2"> as an initial sound in Italian&nbsp;words borrowed from Germanic, e.g.. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">banca</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">panca, balla</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">palla,</span><span class="font2"> the forms with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font2"> being Gothic, those with p Lombardie.&nbsp;Or again </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">recare, **</span><span class="font2"> to bring up,” goes back to Gothic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rikan,</span><span class="font2"> “ heap&nbsp;up,” “collect”; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ricco,</span><span class="font2"> “rich,” to Lomb. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rihhi,</span><span class="font2"> &amp;c. Whereas&nbsp;the vocabulary shows impartially an impress of both nationalities,&nbsp;tfte Lombards have left their stamp unmistakably on the proper&nbsp;names. Speaking generally, Italy as.well as the other Romance&nbsp;countries follows the rule that medieval names of persons arc&nbsp;either “ Christian ” (in the strict sense) and therefore of Hebrew or&nbsp;Graeco-Roman origin, or on the other hand Germanic. Roman&nbsp;names that are not also Christian seem to have Surviv<sup>r</sup>Cd only in&nbsp;south Italy in any great number, while on the contrary the Germanic&nbsp;are not represented at all in Dalmatia.
