<p><span class="font0">drove him from the throne (29th September 996). Cres-cenzio, being master of Castle St Angelo, resumed the title of patrician or consul of the Romans, expelled the German judges, reconstituted the government, prepared his&nbsp;troops for defence, and created a new pope. But the&nbsp;following year Otho III. came to Rome, and his party&nbsp;opened the gates to him. Although deserted by nearly&nbsp;all his adherents, Crescenzio held the castle valiantly&nbsp;against its besiegers. At last, on the 29th April 998, he&nbsp;was forced to make terms, and the imperialists, violating&nbsp;their pledges, first put him to torture and then hurled him&nbsp;from the battlements. Gregory V. dying shortly after&nbsp;these events, Sylvester II., another German, was raised&nbsp;to the papacy (999-1003).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus Otho III. was enabled to establish his mastery of Rome. But, as the son of a Greek mother, trained amid&nbsp;Greek influences, his fantastic and contradictory nature&nbsp;seemed only to grasp the void. He wished to reconstitute&nbsp;a Romano-Byzantine empire with Rome for l∏3 capital.&nbsp;His discourse always turned on the ancient republic, on&nbsp;consuls and senate, on the might and grandeur of the&nbsp;Roman people ; and his edicts were addressed to the senate&nbsp;and the people. The senate is now constantly mentioned,&nbsp;and its heads bear the title of consuls. The emperor also&nbsp;gave renewed honour to the title of patrician, surrounded&nbsp;himself with officials bearing Greek and Roman designations, and raised the prestige of the prefect, who, having&nbsp;now almost the functions of an imperial vicar, bore the&nbsp;eagle and the sword as his insignia. Nevertheless Otho&nbsp;III. was thoroughly German, and during his reign all&nbsp;Germanic institutions made progress in Rome. This was&nbsp;particularly the case with feudalism, and Sylvester II. was&nbsp;the first pope to treat it with favour. Many families of&nbsp;real feudal barons now arose. The Crescenzii held sway&nbsp;in the Sabine hills, and Prseneste and Tusculum were great&nbsp;centres cf feudalism in the llth century. The system of&nbsp;feudal benefices was recognized by the church, which made&nbsp;grants of lands, cities, and provinces in the feudal manner.&nbsp;The bishops, like feudal barons, became actual counts.&nbsp;And, in consequence of these changes, when the emperor,&nbsp;as head of the feudal system, seeks to impose his will upon&nbsp;the church (which has also become feudal) and control the&nbsp;papal elections, he is met by the great question of the&nbsp;investitures, a question destined to disturb the whole&nbsp;world. Meanwhile the Roman barons were growing more&nbsp;and more powerful, and were neither submissive nor faithful to the emperor. On the contrary they resented his&nbsp;attitude as master of Rome, and, when he subjected Tivoli&nbsp;to the Holy See, attacked both him and the pope with so&nbsp;much vigour as to put both to flight (l6th February&nbsp;1001). Thereupon Rome again became a republic, headed&nbsp;by Gregory of Tusculum, a man of a powerful family claiming descent from Alberic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the emperor’s death in January 1002 the race of the Othos became extinct, the papacy began to decline, as at the&nbsp;end of the Carolingian period, and the nobles, divided into&nbsp;an imperial and a national party, were again predominant.&nbsp;They reserved to themselves the office of patrician, and,&nbsp;electing popes from their own ranks, obtained enlarged&nbsp;privileges and power. At the time when Ardoin,&nbsp;marquis of Ivrea, profiting by the extinction of the Othos&nbsp;and the anarchy of Germany, was stirring Italy in the&nbsp;vain hope of constituting a national kingdom, the Roman&nbsp;republic was being consolidated under another Giovanni&nbsp;Crescenzio, of the national faction. He was now elected&nbsp;patrician ; one of his kinsmen was invested with the office&nbsp;of prefect, and the new pope John XVIII. (1003-9) was&nbsp;one of his creatures. Although the power of Henry&nbsp;of Bavaria was then gaining ascendency in Germany,&nbsp;and giving strength to the imperialist nobles, Crescenzio&nbsp;still remained supreme ruler of the city and the Campagna.&nbsp;Surrounded by his judges, the senators, and his kinsman&nbsp;the prefect, he continued to dispense justice in his own&nbsp;palace until his death in 1012, after ten years’ rule.&nbsp;And, Pope Sergius IV. having died the same year, the&nbsp;counts of Tusculum compassed the election of Benedict&nbsp;VIIL (1012-24), one of their own kin. This pope&nbsp;expelled the Crescenzii, changed the prefect, and reserved&nbsp;the title of patrician for Henry II., whom lie consecrated&nbsp;emperor on the 14th February 1014. A second Alberic,&nbsp;bearing the title of “eminentissimus consul et dux,” was&nbsp;now at the head of the republic and dispensed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">placita</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;the palace of his great ancestor, from whom the counts of&nbsp;Tusculum were also descended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The new emperor endeavoured to re-establish order in Rome, and strengthen his own authority together with&nbsp;that of the pope. But the nobles had in all things the&nbsp;upper hand. They were regularly organized under&nbsp;leaders, held meetings, asserted their right to nominate&nbsp;both pope and emperor, and in fact often succeeded in so&nbsp;doing. Even Henry II. himself was obliged to secure&nbsp;their votes before his coronation. The terms senate and&nbsp;senator now recur still more frequently in history. Nevertheless, Benedict VIIL succeeded in placing his own&nbsp;brother, Romano, at the head of the republic with the&nbsp;title of “consul, dux, and senator,” thus making him&nbsp;leader of the nobles, who met at his bidding, and chief of&nbsp;the militia and the tribunals. The prefect still retained his&nbsp;authority, and the emperor was by right supremejudge.&nbsp;But, a violent revolt breaking out, the emperor only stayed&nbsp;to suppress it and then went to Germany in disgust. The&nbsp;pope, aided by his brother, conducted the government&nbsp;with energy ; he awed the party of Crescenzio, and waged&nbsp;war against the Saracens in the south. But he died in&nbsp;1024, and in the same year Henry II. was succeeded by&nbsp;Conrad II. There was now beheld a repetition of the&nbsp;same strange event that had followed the death of Alberic,&nbsp;and with no less fatal consequences. Benedict’s brother&nbsp;Romano, head of the republic, and still retaining office,&nbsp;was, although a layman, elected pope. He took the name&nbsp;of John XIX. (1024-33), and in 1027 conferred the&nbsp;imperial crown on Conrad the Salic, who, abolishing the&nbsp;Lothairian edict of 824, decreed that throughout Rome&nbsp;and its territory justice should be henceforth administered&nbsp;solely by the Justinian code. Thus, notwithstanding the&nbsp;spread of feudalism and Germanic procedure, the Roman&nbsp;law triumphed through the irresistible force of the national&nbsp;character, which was already manifested in many other&nbsp;ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile John XIX. was succeeded by his nephew, Benedict IX. (1033-45), a lad of twelve, who placed his&nbsp;own brother at the head of the republic. Thus church&nbsp;and state assumed the aspect of hereditary possessions in&nbsp;the powerful house of the counts of Tusculum. But the&nbsp;vices and excesses of Benedict were so monstrous that the&nbsp;papacy sank to the lowest depth of corruption ; there&nbsp;followed a series of tumults and reactionary attempts, and&nbsp;so many conflicting elections that in 1045 three popes were&nbsp;struggling for the tiara in the midst of scandal and anarchy.&nbsp;The streets and neighbourhood of Rome swarmed with&nbsp;thieves and assassins ; pilgrims were plundered ; citizens&nbsp;trembled for their lives ; and a hundred petty barons&nbsp;threatened the rival popes, who were obliged to defend&nbsp;themselves by force. This state of things lasted until&nbsp;Henry III. came to re-establish order. He appointed a&nbsp;synod to depose the three popes, and then, with the consent&nbsp;of the wearied and anarchy-stricken Romans, assuming the&nbsp;right of election, proposed a German, Clement II., who was&nbsp;consecrated at Christmas 1046. Henry III. was then&nbsp;crowned, and also took the title of patrician. Thus the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
