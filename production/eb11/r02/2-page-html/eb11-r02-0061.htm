<p><span class="font0">include Castle Semple Loch, Long Loch, Brother Loch, Black Loch, Binend Loch and Dunwan Dam. The Glasgow, Paisley&nbsp;and Johnstone canal has been converted since 1882 into the track&nbsp;of the Glasgow &amp; South-Western railway. Strathgryfe is the&nbsp;only considerable vale in the shire. It extends from the&nbsp;reservoir to below Bridge of Weir, a distance of 10 m. The&nbsp;scenery at its head is somewhat wild and bleak, but the lower&nbsp;reaches are pasture land. The wooded ravine of Glenkillock,&nbsp;to the south of Paisley, is watered by Killock Burn, on which&nbsp;are three falls.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Geology.—</span><span class="font2">Carboniferous rocks form the substratum of this county. The hilly ground from the neighbourhood of Eaglesham northwestward is formed of volcanic rocks, basalts, porphyrites, tuffs&nbsp;and agglomerates of the age of the Cementstone group of the Cal-ciferous Sandstone series. Here and there the sites of the volcanic&nbsp;cones are distinguishable, the best being those between Misty Law&nbsp;and Queenside Muir. Beneath the volcanic rocks are some red&nbsp;sandstones and conglomerates which occupy a small tract between&nbsp;Loch Thom and the neighbourhood of Inverkip. Resting upon&nbsp;the volcanic rocks is the Carboniferous Limestone series which at&nbsp;the base consists of ashy sandstones and grits followed by the three&nbsp;subdivisions prevalent in southern Scotland. With unimportant&nbsp;exceptions, all the area north of the volcanic rocks is occupied by&nbsp;the Carboniferous Limestone series. The beds lie in a faulted&nbsp;basin around Linwood, and the following strata may be distinguished&nbsp;from below upwards: the Hurlet coal and limestone, Lillies oil&nbsp;shale, Hosie limestone, Johnstone clay ironstone and Cowglass limestone along with other beds of ironstone and coal. The sandstone&nbsp;of Giffnock, used for building; the limestone and coal of Orchard&nbsp;with a very fossiliferous shale bed; and the limestone and coal of&nbsp;Arden all belong to the same series. Besides the contemporaneous&nbsp;volcanic rocks numerous intrusive sheets are found in the Carboniferous rocks such as the large mass of basalt south of Johnstone;&nbsp;and doleritic sheet of Quarrelton and the similar sheets N.E. of&nbsp;Paisley. In the eastern part of the county, near the border the&nbsp;coals and ironstones of this scries near Shawlands and Crossmyloof&nbsp;are faulted directly against the coal measures of Rutherglen. Tertiary&nbsp;basalt dikes cut the older rocks in a S.E.-N.W. direction, for example&nbsp;those on Misty Law. Glacial striae abound on xhe hilly ground,&nbsp;those<sub>%</sub>in the north indicating that the ice took a south-easterly&nbsp;direction which farther south became south-westerly. Boulder&nbsp;clays, gravels and sands also cover considerable areas. Copper&nbsp;ore has been worked in the volcanic rocks near Lochwinnoch and&nbsp;in the grey sandstones near Gourock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Climate and Agriculture.—</span><span class="font2">The climate is variable. As the prevailing west and south-west winds come in from the Atlantic&nbsp;warm and full of moisture, contact with the land causes heavy&nbsp;rains, and the western area of the shire is one of the wettest districts&nbsp;in Scotland, the mean annual rainfall exceeding 60 in. The&nbsp;temperature for the year averages about 48° F., for January 38°-5 F.,&nbsp;and for July 58°·$ F. The hilly tract contains much peat-moss and&nbsp;moorland, but over those areas which are not thus covered the&nbsp;soil, which is a light earth on a substratum of gravel, is deep enough&nbsp;to produce good pasture. In the undulating central region the&nbsp;soil is better, particularly in the basins of the streams, while on the&nbsp;flat lands adjoining the Clyde there is a rich alluvium which,&nbsp;except when soured by excessive rain, yields heavy crops. Of the&nbsp;total area three-fifths is under cultivation, more than half of this&nbsp;being permanent pasture. Oats are grown extensively, and wheat&nbsp;and barley are also cultivated. Potatoes, turnips and swedes,&nbsp;and beans are the leading green crops. Near the populous centres&nbsp;orchards and market gardens are found, and an increasing acreage&nbsp;is under wood. Horses are kept mostly for farming operatiöns,&nbsp;and the bulk of the cattle are maintained in connexion with dairying.&nbsp;Sheep-farming, though on the increase, is not prosecuted so vigorously as in the other southern counties of Scotland, and pig-rearing&nbsp;is on the decline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Other Industries.—</span><span class="font2">Coal, iron, oil-shale and fireclay are the principal minerals. Limestone is largely quarried for smelting purposes, and for the manufacture of lime. Sandstone is also quarried.&nbsp;The thread industry at Paisley is the most important in the world.&nbsp;Cotton, spinning, printing, bleaching and dyeing are carried on&nbsp;at Paisley, Pollokshaws, Renfrew, Barrhead and elsewhere;&nbsp;woollens and worsteds are produced at Paisley, Greenock and&nbsp;Renfrew. Engineering works and iron and brass foundries are&nbsp;found at Greenock, Port-Glasgow, Paisley, Renfrew, Barrhead and&nbsp;Johnstone. Sugar is a staple article of trade in Greenock and&nbsp;there are chemical works at Hurlet, Nitshill and Renfrew. Brewing&nbsp;and distilling are carried on at Greenock, Paisley and other places.&nbsp;Shipbuilding is especially important at Greenock and Port-Glasgow.&nbsp;Paper mills are established in Greenock, Cathcart and Johnstone,&nbsp;and tanneries in Paisley and Kilbarchan. Numerous miscellaneous&nbsp;industries—such as the making of starch, cornflour and preserves—&nbsp;have also grown up in Paisley and elsewhere. The sea and river&nbsp;ports are Greenock, Port-Glasgow and Renfrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Railway communication is ample in the north, the centre and towards the south-west. The Caledonian railway runs westwards&nbsp;from Glasgow by Paisley to Greenock, Gourock and Wemyss Bay ;&nbsp;south-westwards to Barrhead and other stations; and southwards&nbsp;to Busby. The Glasgow &amp; South-Western railway runs to&nbsp;Greenock by Paisley, Johnstone and Kilmalcolm; to Nitshill and&nbsp;other places south-westwards; by Lochwinnoch (for Dalry and&nbsp;Ardrossan in Ayrshire); and to Renfrew jointly with the Caledonian. The Clyde and the railway steamers call at Renfrew,&nbsp;Prince’s Pier (Greenock), Gourock and Wemyss Bay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Population and Administration.—</span><span class="font0">In 1891 the population numbered 230,812, and in 1901 it was 268,980, or 1123 to the&nbsp;sq. m. In 1901 there were 40 persons who spoke Gaelic only&nbsp;and 5585 Gaelic and English. Thus though the shire is&nbsp;but twenty-seventh in point of size of the 33 Scottish&nbsp;counties, it is fifth in respect of population, and only Lanarkshire&nbsp;and Mid Lothian are more densely populated. The county is&nbsp;divided into the upper ward, embracing the easterly two-thirds,&nbsp;with Paisley as district centre, and the lower ward, consisting of&nbsp;the parishes of Inverkip, Greenock, Port-Glasgow and Kilmalcolm, with Greenock as district centre. The chief towns&nbsp;are Paisley (pop. 79,363), Greenock (68,142), Port-Glasgow&nbsp;(16,857), Pollokshaws (11,369), Johnstone (11,331), Barrhead&nbsp;(O<sup>8</sup>SS)<sub>i</sub> Renfrew (9296), Gourock (5261), Cathcart (5808). The&nbsp;shire returns one member to parliament for the eastern, and&nbsp;another for the western division. Paisley and Greenock return&nbsp;each one member, and Renfrew and Port-Glasgow belong to the&nbsp;Kilmarnock district, group of parliamentary burghs. Renfrewshire forms a sheriffdom with Bute, and there is a resident&nbsp;sheriff-substitute at Paisley and one at Greenock·. The county&nbsp;is under school-board jurisdiction. For secondary and specialized education there are an academy at Greenock and a grammar&nbsp;school and technical school at Paisley, while some of the schools&nbsp;in the county earn grants for higher education. The county&nbsp;secondary committee also makes provision for the free education of Renfrewshire children in Glasgow High School and the&nbsp;Spier School at Beith. The Paisley Technical School and the&nbsp;Glasgow and West of Scotland Technical College are subsidized&nbsp;out of the “ residue ” grant, part of which also defrays the&nbsp;travelling expenses of students and supports science and art&nbsp;and technological classes in the burghs and towns in the county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font0">At the time of the Roman advance from the Solway the land was peopled by the British tribe of Damnonii. To&nbsp;hold the natives in check the conquerors built in 84 the fort of&nbsp;Vanduara on high ground now covered by houses and streets&nbsp;in Paisley; but after the Romans retired (410) the territory&nbsp;was overrun by Cumbrian Britons and formed part of the&nbsp;kingdom of Strathclyde, the capital of which was situated&nbsp;at Alclyde, the modern Dumbarton. In the 7th and 8th centuries the region practically passed under the supremacy of&nbsp;Northumbria, but in the reign of Malcolm Canmore became&nbsp;incorporated with the rest of Scotland. During the first half&nbsp;of the 12th century, Walter Fitzalan, high steward of Scotland,&nbsp;ancestor of the royal house of Stuart, settled in Renfrewshire&nbsp;on an estate granted to him by David I. Till their accession&nbsp;to the throne the Stuarts identified themselves with the district,&nbsp;which, however, was only disjoined from Lanarkshire in 1404.&nbsp;In that year Robert III. erected the barony of Renfrew and&nbsp;the Stuart estates into a separate county, which, along with&nbsp;the earldom of Carrick and the barony of King’s Kyle (both in&nbsp;Ayrshire), was bestowed upon his son, afterwards James I.&nbsp;From their grant are derived the titles of earl of Carrick and&nbsp;baron of Renfrew, borne by the eldest son of the sovereign.&nbsp;Apart from such isolated incidents as the defeat of Somerled&nbsp;near Renfrew in 1164, the battle of Langside in 1568 and the&nbsp;capture of the 9th earl of Argyll at Inchinnan in 1685, the&nbsp;history of the shire is scarcely separable from that </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">Paisley </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the neighbouring county of Lanark.</span></p>
