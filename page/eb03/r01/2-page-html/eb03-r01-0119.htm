<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to proceed with the </span><span class="font2">utmoſt circumfpection : and after all, ſeldom it happens that ſpeculations of that kind&nbsp;afford any fatisfaction. Luckily, in the preſent caſe,&nbsp;our ſpeculations are ſupported by facts and ſolid argument. Firſt, a -ſmall object of one ſpecies oppoſed to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">great object of another, produces not, in any degree,&nbsp;that deception which is ſo remarkable when both ob-jects are of the ſame ſpecies. The greateſt diſparity&nbsp;between objects of different kinds, is ſo common as to&nbsp;be obferved with perfect indifference ; but ſuch diſpa-rity between the objects of the fame kind being uncommon, never fails to produce ſurpriſe : and may we not&nbsp;fairly conclude, that ſurpriſe, in the latter caſe, is what&nbsp;occafions the deception, when we ſind no deception in&nbsp;the former ? In the npxt place, if ſurpriſe be the ſole&nbsp;cauſe of the deception, it follows neceffarily that the&nbsp;deception will vaniſh as ſoon as the objects compared&nbsp;become familiar. This holds ſo unerringly, as to leave&nbsp;no reaſonable doubt that ſurpriſe is the prime mover:&nbsp;our ſurpriſe is great, the ſirſt time a ſmall lapdog is&nbsp;ſeen with a large maſtiff ; but when two ſuch animals&nbsp;are conſtantly together, there is no furprife, and it&nbsp;makes no difference whether they be viewed feparately&nbsp;or in company. We ſet no bounds to the riches of- a&nbsp;man who has recently made his fortune ; the ſurpriſing&nbsp;diſproportion between his preſent and his paſt ſituation&nbsp;being carried to an extreme : but with regard to a family that for many generations hath enjoyed great&nbsp;wealth, the ſame falſe reckoning is not made. It is&nbsp;equally remarkable, that a trite ſimile has no effect : a&nbsp;lover compared to a moth ſcorching itfelf at the flame&nbsp;of a candle, originally a ſprightly ſimile, has by frequent ule loft all force ; love cannot now be compared&nbsp;to ſire, without ſome degree of diſguft. It has been&nbsp;juftly obſerved againft Homer, that the lion is too often introduced into his ſimiles ; all the variety he is able&nbsp;to throw into them not being ſufficient to keep alive&nbsp;the reader’s ſurpriſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To explain the influence of compariſon upon the mind, we have choſen the ſimpleft caſe, viz. the ſirſt&nbsp;ſight of two animals of the fame kind, differing in&nbsp;ſize only ; but to complete the theory, other circumſtances muſt be taken in. And the next ſuppoſition&nbsp;we make, is where both animals, feparately familiar to&nbsp;the ſpectator, are brought together for the ſirſt time.&nbsp;In that cafe, the effect of magnifying and dimiiiiſtſing&nbsp;is found remarkably greater than in that ſirſt mentioned ; and the reaſon will appear upon analyſing the operation.; the ſtrft feeling we have is of ſurpriſe at the&nbsp;uncommon difference of two creatures of the ſame ſpecies ; we are next ſenfible, that the one appears leſs,&nbsp;the other larger, than they did formerly ; and that new&nbsp;circumſtance increaſingour ſurpriſe, makes us imagine&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">ſtill greater oppoſition between the animals, than if&nbsp;we had formed no notion of them beforehand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let us make one other ſuppoſition, that the ſpectator was acquainted beforehand with one of the animals only ; the lapdog, for example. This new circumſtance&nbsp;will vary the effect ; for, inſtead of widening the natural difference, by enlarging in appearance the one animal, and diminifhing the other in proportion, the&nbsp;whole apparent alteration will reft upon the lapdog :&nbsp;the ſurpriſe to ſind it leſs than it appeared formerly,&nbsp;directs to it our whole attention, and makes us conceive it to be a moſt diminutive creature : the maſtiff</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">in the mean time is quite overlooked. To </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">illuſtrate </span><span class="font2">this effect by a familiar example. Take a piece of pa-per or of linen tolerably white, and compare it with </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">pure white of thc ſame kind : the judgment we formed&nbsp;of the ſirſt object is inſtantly varied ; and the ſurpriſe&nbsp;occafioned by finding it leſs white than was thought,&nbsp;produceth a haſty conviction that it is much leſs white&nbsp;than it is in reality : withdrawing now the pure white,&nbsp;and putting in its place a deep black, the furpriſe occaſioned by that new circumſtance carries us to the&nbsp;other extreme, and makes us conceive the object ſirſt&nbsp;mentioned to be a pure white : and thus experience&nbsp;compels us to acknowledge, that our emotions have an&nbsp;influence even upon our eye-light. 1 his experiment&nbsp;leads to a general obſervation, that whatever is found&nbsp;more ſtrange and beautiful than was expected, is judged&nbsp;to be more ſtrange and beautiful than it is in reality.&nbsp;Hence a common artifice, to depreciate beforehand what&nbsp;we wiih to make a figure in the opinion of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The companions employed by poets and orators are of the kind laſt mentioned; for it is always a known&nbsp;object that is to be magnified or lefleπed∙ The former&nbsp;is effected by likening it to ſome grand object, or by&nbsp;contrafting it with one of an oppoſite character. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">To&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">effectuate the. latter, the method muſt be reverfed ⅛&nbsp;the object muſt be contraſted with fomething ſuperior&nbsp;to it, or likened to ſomething inferior. The whole&nbsp;effect is produced upon the principal object ; which&nbsp;by that means is elevated above its rank, or depreffed&nbsp;below it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In accounting for the effect that any unufual reſemblance or diffimilſtude hath upon the mind, no canſe has been mentioned but ſurpriſe ; and to prevent confuſion, it was proper to diſcuſs that caufe ſirſt. But&nbsp;ſurpriſe is not the only cauſe of the effect deſcribed ;&nbsp;another occurs, which operates perhaps not leſs powerfully, viz. a principle in human nature that lies ſtill&nbsp;in obſcurity, not having been unfolded by any writer, ,&nbsp;though its effects are extenſive : and as it is not diſtinguiſhed by a proper name, the reader muſt be ſatisſied&nbsp;with the following deſcription. Every man who ſtu-dies himſelf or others, muſt be ſenſible of a tendency&nbsp;or propenſity in the mind to complete every work that&nbsp;is begun, and to carry things to their full perfection.&nbsp;There is little opportunity to diſplay that propenſity&nbsp;upon natural operations, which are ſeldom left imperfect ; but in the operations of art it hath great ſcope :&nbsp;it impels us to perſevere in our own work, and to wiſli&nbsp;for the completion of what another is doing : we feel&nbsp;a ſenſible pleaſure when the work is brought to perfection ; and our pain is not leſs fenſible when we are&nbsp;difappointed. Hence our uneaſineſs when an intereſting ſtory is broke off in the middle, when a piece of muſic ends without a cloſe, or when a building or garden is left unſiniihed. The ſame propenſity operates&nbsp;in making collections ; ſuch as the whole works, good&nbsp;and bad, oſ any author. A certain perſon attempted&nbsp;to collect prints of all the capital paintings, and fuc-ceeded except as to a few. La Bruyere remarks, that&nbsp;an anxious ſearch was made for theſe ; not for their&nbsp;value, but to complete the ſet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The final cauſe of the propenſity is an additional proof of its exiſtence. Human works are of no ſigni-ſicancy till they be completed ; and reaſon is not always&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a ſufficient counterbalance to indolence : ſome prin-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
