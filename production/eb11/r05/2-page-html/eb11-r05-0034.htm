<p><span class="font0">and small, the largest being Yetholm or Primside Loch and Horselaw, both in the parish of Linton among outlying hills of&nbsp;the Cheviots. Teviotdale, Liddesdale, Tweedside and Jcdvale&nbsp;are the principal valleys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geology.</span><span class="font0">—This county contains a considerable. range of sedimentary rocks from the Ordovician to the Carboniferous systems, and with these are associated Jarge tracts of volcanic rocks.&nbsp;The Ordovician and Silurian rocks occupy the N.W. and W.&nbsp;part of the county; they have been thrown into numerous&nbsp;sharp folds. It is on the crests of the anticlines that the strata&nbsp;of the former system appear flanked on either side by those of the&nbsp;latter. The oldest rocks are the mudstones and radiolarian. cherts&nbsp;with contemporaneous and intrusive igneous rocks of Arenig age,&nbsp;these are followed by shales and greywackes of Llandeilo age and&nbsp;similar rocks of Caradoc age. Then comes the Silurian with the&nbsp;Birkhill shales and massive grits and greywackes of the Gala or&nbsp;Queensberry group with the Hawick rocks; these are all of Llandovery age and they occupy the greater part of the Silurian area.&nbsp;Wenlock and Ludlow rocks are found S. of Hawick rocks, from&nbsp;Wisp Hill N.E. by Stobs Castleother inlying masses occur in the&nbsp;Old Red Sandstone and Carboniferous areas, the largest of these&nbsp;being that which appears in a belt some 14 m. in length from near&nbsp;Riccarton in the direction of Hobkirk.. Two divisions of the Old&nbsp;Red Sandstone occur; the lower, which consists of subordinate&nbsp;sandstones and conglomerates in sheets of contemporaneous lavas&nbsp;with some tuffs, is confined to the Cheviots; the strata are .uncon-formable upon the upturned Silurian beds. The upper division,&nbsp;which in its turn is unconformable.upon the lower, occupies about&nbsp;one-third of the county. It consists of coarse conglomerates at&nbsp;the base followed by sandstones and marls. It is well developed&nbsp;in the N., where volcanic rocks come in; the Trow Crags of&nbsp;Makerstown which cross the Tweed are due to these lavas. It&nbsp;extends from Newtown and Kelso to Kirkton with extensions in&nbsp;the valleys S.W. Carboniferous rocks are represented by the&nbsp;Calciferous sandstone series; in the S.W. in Liddesdale and on the&nbsp;uplands of Carter Fell, Larriston Fell, &amp;c., they are sandstones&nbsp;with shales, some calcareous beds and coal and volcanic beds. In&nbsp;the N.E. corner of the county the. outer part of the Berwickshire&nbsp;Carboniferous basin just comes within the boundary. An interesting series of volcanic &quot; necks ” belonging to this period is exemplified in Dunain Law, Black Law, Maiden Paps, Ruberslaw and&nbsp;other hills. Glacial deposits are represented by boulder clay and&nbsp;beds and ridges of sand and gravel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Climate and Industries.—</span><span class="font0">The average annual rainfall is about 37 in., higher in the hilly regions and somewhat lower towards the&nbsp;N. and E. The mean temperature for the year is 48° F., for January&nbsp;38° F. and for July 6o° F. The soil is chiefly loam in the level&nbsp;tracts along the banks of the larger streams, where it is also very&nbsp;fertile. In other districts a mixture of clay and gravel is mostly&nbsp;found, but there is besides a considerable extent of mossy land.&nbsp;Of the area under grain about two-thirds are occupied by oats, the&nbsp;remainder being principally devoted to barley. Among green crops&nbsp;turnips and swedes are most generally cultivated, potatoes covering&nbsp;a comparatively small, acreage. In different parts of Tweedside&nbsp;and Jed vale several kinds of fruit are successfully grown. Both&nbsp;in the pastoral and arable localities agriculture is in an advanced&nbsp;condition. The hill country, is everywhere covered with a thick&nbsp;green pasturage admirably.suited for sheep, which occupy the walks&nbsp;in increasingly large quantities. The herds, of cattle are also heavy,&nbsp;horses are kept mostly for farming operations, and pigs are raised&nbsp;in moderate numbers. Fairly large holdings predominate, farms&nbsp;of between 100 and 300 acres being general, and only in Berwickshire is the proportion of farms of more than 1000 acres exceeded.&nbsp;Many districts on the Tweed and Teviot are beautifully wooded,&nbsp;but having regard to the great, area once occupied by forest, the&nbsp;acreage under wood is now relatively small.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The county is the principal seat of the tweed and hosiery manufactures in Scotland. Engineering, ironfounding, dyeing and tanning are also carried on at Hawick and Jedburgh, and agricultural&nbsp;implements and machinery, chemical manures and especially fishing&nbsp;tackle are made at Kelso. The salmon fisheries on the Tweed are&nbsp;of considerable value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Waverley route of the North British railway runs through the county from near Melrose in the N. to Kershopefoot in the S.&nbsp;At St Boswells branches are sent off to Duns and Reston, and to&nbsp;Jedburgh and Kelso via Roxburgh. The North-Eastern railway, an&nbsp;English company, has a line from Berwick to Kelso, via Coldstream&nbsp;and Carham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Population and Administration.—</span><span class="font0">The population in 1901 was. 48,804, or 73 persons to the sq. m. In 1901 there were&nbsp;132 persons who spoke Gaelic and English, but none Gaelic&nbsp;only. The principal towns are Hawick (pop. 17,303), Kelso&nbsp;(4008), Jedburgh (3136), Melrose (2195). The county returns&nbsp;a member to parliament, and Hawick<sup>1</sup> belongs to the Border&nbsp;group of parliamentary burghs. Jedburgh, the county town,&nbsp;is a royal burgh, and Hawick, Kelso and Melrose are police&nbsp;burghs. The shires of Roxburgh, Berwick and Selkirk form&nbsp;a sheriffdom, and a resident sheriff-substitute sits at Jedburgh&nbsp;and Hawick. The county is under school-board jurisdiction,&nbsp;and there are secondary schools at Hawick and Kelso, while the&nbsp;board schools at Jedburgh and Melrose have secondary departments. Most of the “ residue ” grant is expended in assisting&nbsp;teachers to attend science and art classes at Edinburgh University and Hawick, and in subsidizing science and art and&nbsp;technical classes at Hawick, Kelso and elsewhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History and Antiquities.—</span><span class="font0">Among the more important remains of the original inhabitants are the so-called “ Druidical ” stones and circles at Plenderleath between the Kale and Oxnam;&nbsp;on Hownam Steeple, a few miles to the N.W. (where they&nbsp;are locally known as the Shearers and the Bandster); and at&nbsp;Midshiels on the Teviot. The stones on Ninestane Rig, near&nbsp;Hermitage Castle, and on Whisgill are supposed to commemorate the Britons of Strathclyde who, under Aidan, were&nbsp;defeated with great slaughter by Ethelfrith, king of Bernicia,&nbsp;at the battle of Degsanstane or Dawstane in 603. There are&nbsp;hill forts in Liddesdale on the Allan, in the parish of Oxnam,&nbsp;and on the most easterly of the three Eildons. This last is&nbsp;said to be the largest example of its kind in Scotland. The&nbsp;fortress was defended by palisades around the three circular&nbsp;terraces which form the hill-top. Within the enclosure there&nbsp;was a town of huts, judging from certain marks that indicate&nbsp;the site of such dwellings, and the relics of early British pottery&nbsp;that have been found, while the fact that springs exist renders&nbsp;the theory of a settlement all the more probable. One of the&nbsp;most important and most mysterious of British remains is&nbsp;the Catrail, or Piets’ Work Dyke. In its original condition&nbsp;it is supposed to have consisted of a line of double mounds&nbsp;or ramparts, averaging about 30 ft. in width, with an intervening ditch 6 ft. broad, the slope from the centre of the mound&nbsp;to the middle of the bottom of the trench being 10 ft. Owing&nbsp;to weather and other causes, however, it is now far from perfect and in places has disappeared for miles. Beginning at&nbsp;Torwoodlee, N.W. of Galashiels, it ran S.W. to Yarrow church,&nbsp;whence it turned first S. and then S.E., following a meandering&nbsp;course to Peel Fell in the Cheviots, a distance of 48 miles.&nbsp;Though it must have been difficult to defend so long a line,&nbsp;the bulk of opinion is in favour of its being a defence work.&nbsp;Roman remains are also of exceptional interest. Watling&nbsp;Street crossed the Border N. of Brownhart Law (1664 ft.) in&nbsp;the Cheviots, then took a mainly N.W. direction' across the&nbsp;Kale, Oxnam, Jed and Teviot to Newstead, near Melrose,&nbsp;where it is conjectured to have crossed the Tweed and run up&nbsp;Lauderdale into Haddingtonshire. The chief stations were&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ad Fines</span><span class="font0"> on the Cheviot's, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gadanlca</span><span class="font0"> (Bonjedward) near&nbsp;Jedfoot and Eildon Hill (? </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trimontium).</span><span class="font0"> Another so-called&nbsp;Roman road is the Wheel Causeway or Causey, a supposed continuation of the Maiden Way which ran from Overburgh in&nbsp;Lancashire to Bewcastle in Cumberland, and so to the Border.&nbsp;It entered Roxburghshire N. of Deadwater and went (roughly)&nbsp;N. as far as Wolflee, whence its direction becomes a matter of&nbsp;surmise. Of Roman camps the principal appear to have been&nbsp;situated at Cappuck, to the S.E. of Jedburgh, and near Newstead, at the base of the Eildons, the alleged site of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trimontium.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">After the retreat of the Romans the country was occupied&nbsp;by the Britons of Strathclyde in the W. and the Bernicians in&nbsp;the E. It was then annexed to Northumbria for over four&nbsp;centuries until it was ceded, along with Lothian, to Scotland&nbsp;in 1018. David I. constituted it a shire, its. ancient county&nbsp;town of Roxburgh (see Kelso) forming one of the Court of&nbsp;Four Burghs. The castle of Roxburgh, after changing hands&nbsp;more than once, was captured from the English in 1460 and&nbsp;dismantled. Other towns were repeatedly burned down, and&nbsp;the abbeys of Dryburgh, Jedburgh, Kelso and Melrose ultimately ruined in the expedition of the earl of Hertford (the&nbsp;Protector Somerset) in 1544-45. The Border freebooters—of&nbsp;whom the Armstrongs and Elliots were the chief—conducted&nbsp;many a bloody fray on their own account. On the union&nbsp;of the crowns the county gradually settled into what was</span></p>
