<p><span class="font1">fect mode for another free from most of its inconveniences. A boat was brought up the river, through one of these&nbsp;gates, only by raising the waters of the inferior reach, and&nbsp;depressing those of the upper : and it could not escape observation, that when the gates were far asunder, a vast body&nbsp;of water must be discharged before this could be done, and&nbsp;that it would be a great improvement to double each gate,&nbsp;with a very small distance between. Thus a very small&nbsp;quantity of water would fill the interval to the desired height,&nbsp;and allow the boat to come through ; and this thought was&nbsp;the more obvious, from a similar practice having preceded&nbsp;it, viz. that of navigating a small river by means of double&nbsp;bars, the lowest of which lay flat in the bottom of the river,&nbsp;but could be raised up on hinges. We have mentioned&nbsp;this already ; and it appears to have been an old practice,&nbsp;being mentioned by Stevinus in his valuable work on&nbsp;sluices, published about the beginning of the seventeenth&nbsp;century ; yet no trace of this method is to be found of much&nbsp;older dates. It occurred, however, accidentally, pretty often&nbsp;in the flat countries of Holland and Flanders, which being&nbsp;the seat of frequent wars, almost every town and village was&nbsp;fortified with wet ditches, connected with the adjoining&nbsp;rivers. Stevinus mentions particularly the works of Conde,&nbsp;as having been long employed, with great ingenuity, for&nbsp;rendering navigable a very long stretch of the Scheldt.&nbsp;The boats were received into the lower part of the fossee,&nbsp;which was sepârated from the rest by a stone batardeau,&nbsp;serving to keep up the waters in the rest of the fossee about&nbsp;eight feet. In this were a sluice and another dam, by which&nbsp;the boats could be taken into the upper fossee, which communicated with a remote part of the Scheldt, by a long&nbsp;canal. This appears to be one of the earliest locks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the first attempt to introduce this improvement in the navigation of ri¼ers already kept up by weirs, which gave a&nbsp;partial and interrupted navigation, it was usual to avoid the&nbsp;great expense of the second dam and gate, by making the&nbsp;lock altogether detached from the river, within land, and&nbsp;having its basin parallel to the river, and communicating&nbsp;by one end with the river above the weir, and by the other&nbsp;end with the river below the weir, and having a floodgate&nbsp;at each end. This was a most ingenious thought ; and it&nbsp;was a prodigious improvement, free from all the inconveniences of currents, ice, &amp;c. &amp;c. It was called a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">schlussel,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or lock, with considérable propriety ; and this was the origin of the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sluice,</span><span class="font1"> and of our application of its translation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">loch.</span><span class="font1"> This practice being once introduced, it w-as not&nbsp;long before engineers found that a complete separation of&nbsp;the navigation from the bed of the river w-as not only the&nbsp;most perfect method for obtaining a sure, easy, and uninterrupted navigation, but that it was in general the most&nbsp;economical in its first construction, and subject to no risk&nbsp;of deterioration by the action of the current, which was&nbsp;here entirely removed. Locked canals, therefore, have almost entirely supplanted all attempts to improve the natural beds of rivers ; and this is hardly ever attempted except in the flat countries, where they can hardly be said to&nbsp;differ from horizontal canals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The attentive reader must have observed our anxiety to render this dissertation worthy of his notice, by making it&nbsp;practically useful. We have on every occasion appealed&nbsp;from all theoretical deductions, however specious and well&nbsp;supported, to fact and observation of those spontaneous&nbsp;phenomena of nature which are continually passing in review before us in the motion of running waters. Resting&nbsp;in this manner our whole doctrines on experiment, on the&nbsp;observation of what really happens, and what happens in a&nbsp;way which we cannot or do not fully explain, these spontaneous operations of nature came insensibly to acquire a&nbsp;particular value in our imagination. It has also happened&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">in </span><span class="font1">the course of our reflections on these subjects, that these&nbsp;phenomena have frequently presented themselves to our&nbsp;view in groups, not less remarkable for the extent and the&nbsp;importance of their consequences, than for the simplicity,&nbsp;and frequently the seeming insignificancy, nay frivolity, of&nbsp;the means employed. Our fancy has therefore been sometimes warmed witll the view of a something, an</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ens agitans molem, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ct </span><span class="font1">magno se corpore miscens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This has sometimes made us express ourselves in a way that is susceptible of misinterpretation, and may even lead&nbsp;into a mistake of our meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We therefore find ourselves obliged to declare, that by the term Nature, which we have so frequently used </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">con&nbsp;amore,</span><span class="font1"> w<sup>,</sup>e do not mean that indescribable idol which the&nbsp;self-conceit and vanity of some philosophers or pretended philosophers have set up and ostentatiously worshipped,&nbsp;that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ens rationis,</span><span class="font1"> that creature of the imagination, which&nbsp;has long been the object of cool contemplation in the closet of the philosopher, and has shared his attention with&nbsp;many other playthings of his ever-working fancy. By Nature we mean that admirable system of general laws, by&nbsp;which the adored Author and Governor of the universe has&nbsp;thought fit to connect the various parts of this wonderful&nbsp;and goodly frame of things, and to regulate all their operations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We are not afraid of continually appealing to the laws of nature ; and, as we have already observed in the article&nbsp;Philosophy, we consider these general laws as the most&nbsp;magnificent displays of Infinite Wisdom, and the contemplation of them as the most cheering employment of our&nbsp;understandings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Igneus est illis vigor ct cœlestis origo Seminibus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the same time we despise the cold-hearted philosopher who stops short here, and is satisfied, perhaps inwardly&nbsp;pleased, that he has completely accounted for every thing&nbsp;by the laws of unchanging nature ; and w-e suspect that&nbsp;this philosopher would analyse with the same frigid ingenuity, and explain by irresistible </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">βτοsγη,</span><span class="font1"> the tender attachment of her whose breast he sucked, and who by many&nbsp;anxious and slecpless nights preserved alive the puling infant. But let us rather listen to the w<sup>,</sup>ords of him who was&nbsp;the most sagacious observer and the most faithful interpreter of nature’s laws, our illustrious countryman Sir Isaac&nbsp;Newton.</span></p>

Hunc admiramur ob perfectiones ;&nbsp;hunc veneramur et colimus ob dominium.”</span></p>
