<p><span class="font2">REUTER, PAUL JULIUS, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Baron de</span><span class="font2"> (1821-1899), founder of Reuter’s News Agency, was born at Cassel, Germany. At the&nbsp;age of thirteen he became a clerk in his uncle’s bank at Göttingen,&nbsp;where he chanced to make the acquaintance of Professor Gauss,&nbsp;whose experiments in telegraphy were then attracting some&nbsp;attention. Reuter’s mind was thus directed to the value of&nbsp;the speedy transmission of information, and in 1849, <sup>on</sup> the&nbsp;completion of the first telegraph lines in Germany and France,&nbsp;he found an opportunity of turning his ideas to account. There&nbsp;was a gap between the termination of the German line at Aix-la-Chapelle and that of the French and Belgian lines at Verviers.&nbsp;Reuter organized a news-collecting agency at each of these&nbsp;places, his wife being in charge of one, himself at the other, and&nbsp;bridged the interval by a pigeon-post. On the establishment&nbsp;of through telegraphic communication, Reuter endeavoured to&nbsp;start a news agency in Paris, but finding that the French government’s restrictions would render the scheme unworkable,&nbsp;removed in 1851 to England and became a naturalized British&nbsp;subject. The first submarine cable—between Dover and&nbsp;Calais—had just been laid, and Reuter opened an office in&nbsp;London for the transmission of intelligence between England&nbsp;and the continent. At first, however, his business was practically confined to the transmission of private commercial telegrams&nbsp;to places not connected with the new telegraph system. He&nbsp;appointed agents at the various telegraph termini on the continent to take these despatches off the wires and forward them&nbsp;by rail or pigeon-post to the addresses. Simultaneously he&nbsp;endeavoured to induce the English papers to publish the foreign&nbsp;news telegrams supplied by his various agents. These efforts&nbsp;were for some years unsuccessful, until in 1858 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Times&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">published the report of an important speech by Napoleon III.&nbsp;forwarded by Reuter’s Paris agent. Reuter now extended his&nbsp;sphere of operations all over the world, and in 1859 obtained&nbsp;leave for the presence of representatives at the headquarters of&nbsp;the Austrian and French armies during the war. In 1866 he&nbsp;laid down a special cable from Cork to Crookhaven, which&nbsp;enabled him to circulate news of the American Civil War several&nbsp;hours before the steamer could reach Liverpool. A concession&nbsp;for a cable beneath the North Sea to Cuxhaven was granted&nbsp;him by the king of Hanover in 1865, and in the same year a&nbsp;concession was granted him for a cable between France and&nbsp;the United States, the line being worked jointly by Reuter&nbsp;(whose business had just been converted into a Iimitedliability&nbsp;company) and the Anglo-American Telegraph Company. In&nbsp;1872 he obtained from the shah of Persia an exclusive concession&nbsp;to develop the internal resources of that country, but the concession was annulled and its privileges transferred to the Imperial Bank of Persia. Reuter was in 1871 given the title of&nbsp;baron by the duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, and by a special&nbsp;grant of Queen Victoria he and his heirs were authorized to have&nbsp;the privileges of this rank in England. Baron Reuter died at&nbsp;Nice on the 25th of February 1899.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REUTERHOLM, GUSTAF ADOLF, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Baeon</span><span class="font2"> (1756-1813), Swedish statesman. After a brief military career he was appointed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Kammerherr</span><span class="font2"> to Sophia Magdalena, queen consort of&nbsp;Gustavus III., and subsequently became intimately connected&nbsp;with the king’s brother, Charles, then duke of Sudermania. He&nbsp;remained in the background throughout the reign of Gustavus&nbsp;IIL, whom he constantly opposed and by whom he was imprisoned along with the other malcontents in 1789. He was&nbsp;abroad at the time of the king’s death, but a summons from&nbsp;his friend, now duke regent, speedily recalled him, and in 1793&nbsp;he was made a member of the council of state and one of the&nbsp;“ lords of the realm.” At first he seemed inclined to adopt a&nbsp;liberal system, and reintroduced the freedom of the press. Hc&nbsp;did this solely, however, to reverse the Gustavian system, and&nbsp;persecuted the stalwarts of the late king </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font2"> G. M. Armfelt,&nbsp;J. K. Toll) with a petty vindictiveness which excited general&nbsp;disgust. Towards the end of the regency, Reuterholm inclined&nbsp;towards an alliance with Russia on the basis of a marriage&nbsp;between the young king, Gustavus IV., and the empress&nbsp;Catherine’s granddaughter, Alexandra Pavlovna, an alliance&nbsp;frustrated by the bigotry of the intended groom. At home the&nbsp;Swedish government ended as ultra-reactionary, owing to an&nbsp;insignificant riot in Stockholm which so alarmed Reuterholm&nbsp;that he threatened all printers who printed anything relating&nbsp;to the constitutions of the French republic or the United States&nbsp;of America with the loss of their privileges. In March 1795 he&nbsp;closed the Swedish Academy because A. G. Silfverstolpe in his&nbsp;inaugural address had ventured to disapprove of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">coup PHat&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of 1789. On the accession of Gustavus IV. (November ist,&nbsp;1796) Reuterholm was expelled from Stockholm. For the next&nbsp;twelve years he lived abroad under the name of Tempelcrentz.&nbsp;After the revolution of 1809 he returned to Sweden, but was&nbsp;denied all access to Charles XIII., and quitted his country for&nbsp;good. He died in Schleswig on the 27th of December 1813.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REUTLINGEN, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Württemberg, situated on the Echatz, an affluent of the Neckar,&nbsp;near the base of the Achalm and 36 m. by rail S. of Stuttgart.&nbsp;Pop. (1905) 23,850. It is a quaintly built town, with many&nbsp;picturesque houses and a fine Gothic church of the 13th and&nbsp;14th centuries dedicated to St Mary, which was restored in&nbsp;1893-1901; it contains in the choir a replica of the Holy&nbsp;Sepulchre and a sculptured stone font, and has a tower 240 ft.&nbsp;high. Reutlingen has three other Evangelical churches, a&nbsp;Roman Catholic church, a town hall, and several monuments,&nbsp;including one to the emperor William I. and another to Friedrich&nbsp;List. The industries of the town are numerous, and include the&nbsp;spinning and weaving of cotton, dyeing and bleaching; also the&nbsp;manufacture of leather, machinery, furniture, shoes, paper,&nbsp;clothing, hardware, bricks, beer and woollen goods. Hops,&nbsp;vines and fruit are grown in the neighbourhood. Reutlingen&nbsp;has several schools and educational establishments, including&nbsp;a celebrated pomological institute. It is also famous as the place&nbsp;where PastorGustav Werner (1809-1887) founded his Christian&nbsp;Socialist refuge, which has become widely known in philanthropic&nbsp;circles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Reutlingen, which is first mentioned in 1213., became a free imperial town in the 13th century and was fortified by the emperor Frederick II., remaining loyal to him and to his son, Conrad IV.&nbsp;A member of the league of Swabian towns, its citizens defeated&nbsp;Count Ulrich of Württemberg on the 14th of May 1377. Later it&nbsp;joined the Swabian League and was favoured by the emperor Maximilian I. It came into the possession of Württemberg in 1802. An&nbsp;explosion which took place on the 27th of December 1852 destroyed&nbsp;many houses in the town.</span></p>
