<p><span class="font0">was therefore driven to make his submission to the pope but, again rebelling, was summoned to trial in Rome (1460)&nbsp;before a tribunal of hostile cardinals. All the old charges&nbsp;against him were now revived and eagerly confirmed. He&nbsp;was pronounced guilty of rapine, incendiarism, incest,&nbsp;assassination, and heresy. The murder and violation of&nbsp;Borbona’s wife was brought up ; he was accused of having&nbsp;tortured his former preceptor, in revenge for punishments&nbsp;received in his youth, and of having killed three wives—&nbsp;although it seems that he had only two besides his ever-beloved Isotta, who survived him. He was also severely&nbsp;blamed for the erection of a temple which, as the pope&nbsp;justly remarked, was better adapted for the worship of&nbsp;pagan demons than of the Christian God. Nor was it&nbsp;forgotten how, when Pius II. had proclaimed a crusade&nbsp;against the infidels at the assembly at Mantua, Sigismondo&nbsp;had secretly invited the Grand Turk to make a descent&nbsp;upon Italy. Consequently he was sentenced to the deprivation of his state (which was probably the main object&nbsp;of the trial), and to be burnt alive as a heretic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This sentence, however, could not easily be executed, and Sigismondo was only burnt in effigy. But the pope&nbsp;marked the intensity of his hatred by causing the dummy&nbsp;to be carved and dressed with such life-like resemblance&nbsp;that he was almost able to persuade himself that his hated&nbsp;enemy was really consumed in the flames. Malatesta&nbsp;could afford to laugh at this farce, but he nevertheless&nbsp;prepared in haste for a desperate defence (1462). He&nbsp;knew that the bishop Vitelleschi, together with the duke of&nbsp;Urbino and his own brother Novello Malatesta, lord of&nbsp;Cesena, were advancing against him in force ; and, being&nbsp;defeated by them at Pian di Marotta, he was driven to&nbsp;Rome in 1463 to again make submission to the pope.&nbsp;This time he was stripped of all his possessions excepting&nbsp;the city of Rimini and a neighbouring castle, but the&nbsp;sentence of excommunication was withdrawn. For, now&nbsp;that Malatesta’s power was crushed, the object of the war&nbsp;was attained. Its continuance would have been inexpedient, and might have too suddenly roused the fears of&nbsp;the other potentates of Romagna, who were all destined,&nbsp;sooner or later, to share the same fate. The once mighty&nbsp;tyrant of Rimini found himself reduced to penury with&nbsp;a state chiefly composed of a single town. He therefore took service with the Venetians, and in 1464 had the&nbsp;command of an expedition to the Morea. Here his&nbsp;movements were so hampered by the interference of the&nbsp;commissioners of the republic that, with all his valour,&nbsp;he could achieve no decisive success. In 1466 he was&nbsp;able to return to Rimini, for Pius II. was dead, and the&nbsp;new pope, Paul IL, was less hostile to him. Indeed the&nbsp;latter offered to give him Spoleto and Foligno, taking&nbsp;Rimini in exchange ; but Malatesta was so enraged by the&nbsp;proposal that he went to Rome with a dagger concealed&nbsp;on his person, on purpose to kill the pope. But, being&nbsp;forewarned, Paul received him with great ceremony, and&nbsp;surrounded by cardinals prepared for defence ; whereupon&nbsp;Sigismondo changed his mind, fell on his knees and implored forgiveness. His star had now set for ever. For&nbsp;sheer subsistence he had to hire his sword to the pope and&nbsp;quell petty rebellions with a handful of men. At last, his&nbsp;health failing, he returned to his family, and died in Rimini&nbsp;on the 7th October 1468, aged fifty-one years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was succeeded, according to his desire, by Isotta and his son Sallustio. But there was an illegitimate&nbsp;elder son by another mother, named Roberto Malatesta, a&nbsp;valiant and unscrupulous soldier. Befriended by the&nbsp;pope, this man undertook to conquer Rimini for the Holy&nbsp;See, but came there to further his own ends instead&nbsp;(20th October 1469), and, while feigning a desire to share&nbsp;the government -with Isotta and her son, resolved, sooner&nbsp;or later, to seize it for himself. This aroused the pope’s&nbsp;wrath, and Roberto instantly prepared for defence. Finding an ally in the duke of Urbino, whose eyes were now&nbsp;opened to the aggressive policy of the church, he was&nbsp;able to repulse its forces. Paul II. died soon after, and was&nbsp;succeeded by Sixtus IV. Roberto’s position was now more&nbsp;secure, and in order to strengthen his recent alliance he&nbsp;betrothed himself to the daughter of the duke of Urbino.&nbsp;The next step was to dispose of his rival kindred. On the&nbsp;8th August 1470 Isotta’s son was found murdered in a&nbsp;well belonging to the Marcheselli family; and a bloodstained sword, placed in their courtyard by Roberto,&nbsp;made it appear as though they had been guilty of the&nbsp;crime. Towards the end of the same year Isotta died&nbsp;also, apparently of a slow fever, but really, it was believed,&nbsp;by poison. Another of her sons, Valerio, born in 1453,&nbsp;still lived, but he was openly put to death by Roberto&nbsp;on a trumped-up charge of treason. In 1475 the new&nbsp;tyrant celebrated his nuptials with the duke of Urbino’s&nbsp;daughter, and, being again taken into favour by the pope,&nbsp;valiantly defended him in Rome against the attacks of&nbsp;the duke of Calabria, and died there in 1482 of the&nbsp;hardships endured in the war. His widow was left&nbsp;regent during the minority of his son Pandolfo, who was&nbsp;nicknamed Pandolfaccio on account of his evil nature.&nbsp;Directly he was of age, he seized the reins of government&nbsp;by killing some relations who had plotted against him, and&nbsp;crushed another conspiracy in the same way. A daring&nbsp;soldier, he distinguished himself at the battle of the Taro&nbsp;against the French ; but his tyranny made him hated by his&nbsp;subjects. In 1500, when Cesare Borgia fell on Romagna&nbsp;with violence and fraud, this Malatesta shared the fate of&nbsp;other petty tyrants and had to fly for his life. After the&nbsp;fall of the Borgia he returned, but, being bitterly detested&nbsp;by his people, decided to sell his rights to the Venetians, who&nbsp;had long desired to possess Rimini, and who gave him in&nbsp;exchange the town of Cittadella, some ready money, and a&nbsp;pension for life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This arrangement was naturally disapproved by Rome, and especially by Julius IL, who had already repeatedly&nbsp;vowed that, unless Venice restored the cities she had so&nbsp;unjustly seized—Cervia, Ravenna, and Rimini—he would&nbsp;turn the world upside down to regain them. And he&nbsp;kept his word. For he contrived the league of Cambray&nbsp;on purpose to ruin the Venetians, who were crushingly&nbsp;defeated in 1509. Thereupon the pope, having accomplished his own ends, made alliance with the Venetians,&nbsp;who were now prostrate at his feet, and, with them, the&nbsp;Spaniards, and the Swiss, fought against the French at&nbsp;Ravenna in 1512. Here the French were victors, but&nbsp;owing to their heavy losses and the death of their renowned&nbsp;leader, Gaston de Foix, were compelled to retreat. Thus&nbsp;Julius became master of Rimini and the other coveted&nbsp;lands. Malatesta made more than one attempt to win&nbsp;back his city, but always in vain, for his subjects preferred&nbsp;the papal rule. He returned there for the last time while&nbsp;Marshal Bourbon was laying .siege to Rome; but in 1528&nbsp;Pope Clement VII. became definitive master of the town.&nbsp;Thus, after two hundred and fifty years, the sway of the&nbsp;Malatesta came to an end, and Pandolfo was reduced to&nbsp;beggary. In fact, we find him petitioning the duke of Ferrara for the gift of a couple of crowns and promising to ask&nbsp;for no more. He died in 1534, leaving a daughter and two&nbsp;sons in great poverty. The elder, Sigismondo, after various&nbsp;military adventures, died at Reggio d’Emilia in 1543 ; and&nbsp;Malatesta, the younger, went to fight in the Scotch and&nbsp;English wars, and was never heard of again. Sigismondo&nbsp;had left male heirs who made another attempt to regain&nbsp;Rimini in 1555, but Pope Paul IV. declared them deposed&nbsp;in perpetuity in punishment of Pandolfaccio’s misdeeds.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
