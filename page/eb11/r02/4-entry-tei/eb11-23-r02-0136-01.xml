                <p><label>REPTILES</label> (Lat. <hi rend="italic">Reptilia,</hi> creeping things,
                    from <hi rend="italic">reptilis; refere,</hi> to creep; Gr. epTretP, whence the
                    term “herpetology,” for the science dealing with them). In the days before
                    Linnaeus, writers comprised the animals which popularly are known as tortoises
                    and turtles, crocodiles, lizards and snakes, frogs and toads, newts and
                    salamanders, under the name of oviparous quadrupeds or four-limbed animals which
                    lay eggs. Linnaeus, desirous of giving expression to the extraordinary fact that
                    many of these animals pass part of their life in the water and part on land,
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> “ Polymorpha in
                        his amphibiis natura duplicem vitam plerisque concessit.” </note>
                    substituted the name of Amphibia for the ancient term. Subsequent French
                    naturalists (Lyonnet <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2">
                        <hi rend="italic">Théologie des insectes de Lesser</hi> (Paris, 1745), i.
                        91, note 5. </note> and Brisson <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial" n="3">
                        <hi rend="italic">Régne animal divise en neuf classes</hi> (Paris, 1756).
                    </note> ) considered that the creeping mode of locomotion was a more general
                    characteristic of the class than their amphibious habits, and consequently
                    proposed the scarcely more appropriate name of <hi rend="italic">Reptiles,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As naturalists gradually comprehended the wide gap existing between frogs,
                    toads, &amp;c., on the one hand, and the other oviparous quadrupeds on the
                    other, they either adopted the name of Batrachia for the former and that of
                    Amphibia for the latter, or they restricted the term Amphibia to Batrachians,
                    calling the remainder of these creatures reptiles. Thus the term Amphibia, as
                    used by various authors, may apply (1) to all the various animals mentioned, or
                    (2) to Batrachians only (see Batrachia). The term Reptiles (Reptilia) is used
                    (1) by some for all the animals mentioned above, and (2) by others, as in the
                    present article, for the same assemblage of animals after the exclusion of
                    Batrachians.</p>
               <p>Equally varying are the limits of the term Saurians, which occurs so frequently
                    in every scientific treatise on this subject. At first it comprised living
                    crocodiles and lizards only, with which a number of fossil forms were gradually
                    associated. As the characters and affinities of the latter became better known,
                    some of them were withdrawn from the Saurians, and at present it is best to
                    abandon the term altogether.</p>
               <p>work, however, was rather that of a comparative treatise of the anatomical and
                    physiological characters of animals than their systematic arrangement and
                    definition, and his ideas about the various groups of reptiles are not
                    distinctly expressed, but must be gleaned from the terms which he employs.
                    Moreover, he paid less attention to the study of reptiles than to that of other
                    classes. This is probably due to the limited number of kinds he could be
                    acquainted with, to which only very few extra-European forms, like the
                    crocodile, were added from other sources. But while we find in some respects a
                    most remarkable accuracy of knowledge, there is sufficient evidence that he
                    neglected everyday opportunities of information. Thus, he has not a single word
                    about the metamorphoses of Batrachians, which he treats of in connexion with
                    reptiles.</p>
               <p>Aristotle makes a clear distinction between the scute or scale of a reptile,
                    which he describes as φολ£$, and that of a fish, which he designates as Xeris.
                    He mentions reptiles (1) as oviparous quadrupeds with scutes, viz. Saurians and
                    Chelonians; (2) as oviparous apodals, viz. Snakes; (3) as oviparous quadrupeds
                    without scutes, viz. Batrachians. He considered the first and second of these
                    three groups as much more nearly related to each other than to the third.
                    Accurate statements and descriptions are sadly mixed with errors and stories of,
                    to our eyes, the most absurd and fabulous kind. The most complete accounts are
                    those of the crocodile (chiefly borrowed from Herodotus) and of the chameleon,
                    which Aristotle evidently knew from personal observation, and had dissected
                    himself. The other lizards mentioned by him are the common lizards (σαύρα), the
                    common seps (χαλ/ds <hi rend="italic">orÇiyvis)</hi> and the gecko <hi
                        rend="italic">(άσκα\αβώτη$</hi> or <hi rend="italic">KopbvKos).</hi> Of
                    snakes (of which he generally speaks as 60is) he knew the vipers (e%tç or <hi
                        rend="italic">εχώνα),</hi> the common snake <hi rend="italic">(vbpos),</hi>
                    and the blindworm (τυφλίρη? ö$ts), which he regards as a snake; he further
                    mentions the Egyptian cobra and dragons <hi rend="italic">(δράκων)</hi>
                    —North-African serpents of fabulous size. Of Chelonians he describes in a
                    perfectly recognizable manner land tortoises <hi rend="italic">(χεΚώνη),</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Passing over eighteen centuries, we find the knowledge of reptiles to have
                    remained as stationary as other branches of natural history, perhaps even more
                    so. The reptile fauna of Europe was not extensive enough to attract the energy
                    of a Belorn or Rondelet; popular prejudice and the difficulty of preserving
                    these animals deterred from their study; nor was man sufficiently educated not
                    to give implicit credence to the fabulous tales of reptiles in the 15th and 16th
                    centuries. The art of healing, however, was developing into a science based upon
                    rational principles, and consequently not only those reptiles which formed part
                    of the <hi rend="italic">materia medica</hi> but also the venomous snakes became
                    objects of study to the physician, though the majority of the writers were
                    ignorant of the structure of the venom-apparatus, and of the distinction between
                    non-venomous and venomous snakes.</p>
               <p>Nothing can show more clearly the small advance made by herpetology in this long
                    post-Aristotelian period than a glance at the celebrated work, <hi rend="italic"
                        >De Differentiis Animalium Libri decem</hi> (Paris, 1552), by Edward Wotton

               <p>Wotton’s work might with propriety be termed “ Aristoteles redivivus.” The plan
                    is the same, and the observations of the Greek naturalist are faithfully,
                    sometimes literally, reproduced.</p>

               <p>History of Herpetology</p>
               <p>Certain kinds of reptiles are mentioned in the earliest written records or have
                    found a place among the fragments of the oldest relics of human art. Such
                    evidences, however, form no part of a succinct Teview of the literature of the
                    subject such as it is proposed to give here. We distinguish in it six periods:
                    (1) the Aristotelian; (2) the Linnaean (formation of a class Amphibia, in which
                    reptiles and Batrachians are mixed); (3) the period of the elimination of
                    Batrachians as one of the reptilian orders (Brongniart); (4) that of the
                    separation of reptiles and Bat-rachians as distinct subclasses; (5) that of the
                    recognition of a class Reptilia as part of the Sauropsida (Huxley) ; (6) that of
                    the discovery of fossil skeletons sufficiently well preserved to reveal, in its
                    general outlines, the past history of the class.</p>
               <p>I. <hi rend="italic">The Aristotelian Period.—</hi> Aristotle was the first to
                    deal with the reptiles known to him as members of a distinct portion of the
                    animal kingdom, and to point out the characteristics by which they resemble each
                    other and differ from other vertebrate and invertebrate animals. The plan of his</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0137" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0160.jp2"/>
               <p>It is surprising that even the reptiles <hi rend="sup">Λ</hi> ί his native
                    country were most imperfectly known to the author.</p>
               <p>With the enlargement of geographical knowledge that of reptiles was also
                    advanced, as is sufficiently apparent from the <hi rend="italic">Johnston.</hi>
                    I <hi rend="sup">ar</hi> S <hi rend="sup">c</hi> encyclopaedic works of Gesner,
                    Aldrovandi and Johnston. The last-named author especially, who published the
                    various portions of his Natural History in the middle of the 17th century, was
                    able to embody in his compilations notices of numerous reptiles observed by
                    Francisco Hernandez in Mexico and by Marcgrave and Piso in Brazil. As the author
                    had no definite idea of the Ray-Linnaean term “ species,” it is not possible to
                    give the exact number of reptiles mentioned in his work. But it may be estimated
                    at about fifty, not including some marine fishes and fabulous creatures. Hc
                    figures (or rather reproduces the figures of) about forty—some species being
                    represented by several figures.</p>
               <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Linnaean Period: Formation of a Class Amphibia.—</hi>
                    Within the century which succeeded these compilatory works (1650-1750) fall the
                    labours which prepared the way for and exerted the greatest influence on Ray and
                    Linnaeus. Although original researches in the field of herpetology were limited
                    in extent and in number, the authors had freed themselves from the purely
                    literary or scholastic tendency. Men were no longer satisfied with reproducing
                    and commenting on the writings of their predecessors; the pen was superseded by
                    the eye, the microscope and the knife, and statements were tested by experiment.
                    This spirit of the age manifested itself, so far as the reptiles are concerned,
                    in Chara’s and Redi’s admirable observations on the viper, in Major’s and
                    Vallisnieri <hi rend="sup">i</hi> S detailed accounts of the anatomy of the
                    chameleon, in the researches of Jacobaeus into the metamorphoses of the
                    Batrachians and the structure of lizards, in Dufay’s history of the development
                    of the salamander (for Batrachians are invariably associated with reptiles
                    proper); in Tyson’s description of the anatomy of the rattlesnake, &amp;c.
                    The natural history collections formed by institutions and wealthy individuals
                    now contained not merely skins of crocodiles or serpents stuffed and transformed
                    into a shape to correspond with the fabulous descriptions of the ancient
                    dragons, but, with the discovery of alcohol as a means of preserving animals,
                    reptiles entire or dissected were exhibited for study; and no opportunity was
                    lost of obtaining them from travellers or residents in foreign countries.
                    Fossils also were now acknowledged to be remains of animals which had lived
                    before the Flood, and some of them were recognized as</p>
               <p>those of reptiles.</p>
               <p>The contributions to a positive knowledge of the animal kingdom became so
                    numerous as to render the need of a methodical arrangement of the abundance of
                    new facts more and more pressing. Of the two principal systematic attempts made
                    in this period the first ranks as one of the most remarkable steps of the
                    progress of natural history, whilst the second can only be designated as a
                    signal failure, which ought to have been a warning to all those who in after
                    years classified animals in what is called an, “ artificial system.” As the
                    latter attempt, originating with Klein (1685-1759), did not exercise any further
                    influence on herpetology, it will be sufficient to have merely <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ray</hi> mentioned it. John Ray (1628-1705) had recognized the necessity of
                    introducing exact definitions for the several categories into which the animals
                    had to be divided, and he maintained that these categories ought to bè
                    characterized by the structure of animals, and that all zoological knowledge had
                    to start from the “ species ” as its basis. His definition of reptiles as “
                    animalia sanguinea pulmone respirantia cor unico tantum ventriculo instructum
                    habentia ovipara ” fixed the class in a manner which was adopted by the
                    naturalists of the succeeding hundred and fifty years. Nevertheless, Ray was not
                    a herpetologist; his knowledge of reptiles is chiefly derived from the
                    researches of others, from whose accounts, however, everything not based upon
                    reliable demonstration is critically excluded. He begins with a chapter treating
                    of frogs <hi rend="italic">(Rana,</hi> with two species), toads <hi
                        rend="italic">(Bufo</hi> , with one species) and tortoises <note
                        anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="4"> In associating
                        tortoises with toads, Ray could not disengage himself from the general
                        popular view as to the nature of these animals, which found expression in
                        the German <hi rend="italic">Schildkrote</hi> (“ Shield-toad ”). </note>
                    <hi rend="italic">(Tesludo <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> with fourteen species). the second group comprises the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lacertae,</hi> twenty-five in number, and includes the salamander and
                    newts; and the third the <hi rend="italic">Serpentes,</hi> nine species, among
                    which the limbless lizards are enumerated.</p>
               <p>Except in so far as he made known and briefly characterized a number of
                    reptiles, our knowledge of this class was not advanced by Linnaeus. That he
                    associated in the 12th edition cartilaginous and other fishes with the reptiles
                    under the name of <hi rend="italic">Amphibia N antes</hi> was the result of some
                    misunderstanding of an observation by Garden, and is not to be taken as a
                    premonitory token of the recent discoveries of the relation between Batrachians
                    and fishes. Linnaeus places reptiles, which he calls Amphibia, as the third
                    class of the animal kingdom; he divides the genera thus:—</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Order i. Reptiles.—</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Testudo</hi> (15 species); <hi rend="italic">Rana</hi> (17
                    sp.); <hi rend="italic">Draco</hi> (2 sp.); <hi rend="italic">Lacerta</hi> (48
                    sp., including 6 Batrachians).</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="smallcaps">Order</hi> 2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentes.—</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Crotcdus</hi> (5 species); <hi rend="italic">Boa</hi> (10
                    sp.); <hi rend="italic">Coluber</hi> (96 sp.); <hi rend="italic">Anguis</hi> (15
                    sp.); <hi rend="italic">Amphisbaena (2</hi> sp.); <hi rend="italic"
                        >Caecilia</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">(2</hi> sp.).</p>
               <p>None of the naturalists who under the direction or influence of Linnaeus visited
                    foreign countries possessed any special knowledge of or predilection for the
                    study of reptiles; all, however, contributed to our acquaintance with tropical
                    forms, or transmitted .well-preserved specimens to the collections at home, so
                    that Gmelin, in the 13th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Systema Naturae,</hi>
                    was able to enumerate three hundred and seventy-one species.</p>
               <p>The man who, with the advantage of the Linpaean method, first treated of
                    reptiles Hionographically, was Laurenti. In a small book <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="5">
                        <hi rend="italic">Specimen medicum exhibens Synopsin Reptilium emendatam cum
                            experiments circa venena et antidota Reptilium Ausiriacorum</hi>
                        (Vienna, 1768, 8vo, pp. 214, with 5 plates). </note> he proposed a new
                    division of these animals, of which some ideas and terms have survived into our
                    times, characterizing the orders, genera and species in a much more precise
                    manner than Linnaeus, giving, for his time, excellent descriptions and figures
                    of the species of his native country. Laurenti might have become for herpetology
                    what Artedi was for ichthyology, but his resources were extremely limited.</p>
               <p>The circumstance that Chelonians are entirely omitted from his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Synopsis</hi> seems due rather to the main object with which he engaged in
                    the study of herpetology, viz. that of examining and distinguishing reptiles
                    reputed to be poisonous, and to want of material, than to his conviction that
                    tortoises should be relegated to another class. He divides the class into three
                    orders:—</p>
               <p>1. Salientia, with the genera <hi rend="italic">Pipa, Bufo, Rana, Hyla,</hi> and
                    one</p>
               <p>species of “ <hi rend="italic">Protcus</hi> ,” viz. the larva of <hi
                        rend="italic">Pseudis paradoxa.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>2. Gradientia, the three first genera of which are Tailed Batrach-</p>
               <p>ians, viz. two species of <hi rend="italic">Proteus</hi> (one being the <hi
                        rend="italic">P. anguinus), Triton</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Salamandra
                        ;</hi> followed by true Saurians— <hi rend="italic">Caudiverbera, Gecko,
                        Chamaeleo, Iguana, Basiliscus, Draco,Cordylus, Crocodilus, Scincus, Stellio,
                        Seps.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3. <hi rend="smallcaps">Serpentia, among which he continues to keep</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Amphisbaena,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Caecilia</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Anguis,</hi> but the large
                    Linnaean genus <hi rend="italic">Coluber</hi> is divided into twelve, chiefly
                    from the Scutellation of the head and form of the body.</p>
               <p>The work concludes with an account of the experiments made by Laurenti to prove
                    the poisonous or innocuous nature of thosc reptiles of which he could obtain
                    living specimens.</p>
               <p>The next general work on reptiles is by Lacépède. It appeared in the years 1788
                    and 1790 under the title <hi rend="italic">Histoire naturelle des quadrupèdes
                        ovipares et des serpens</hi> (Paris,</p>
               <p>2 vols. 4to). Although as regards treatment of details and amount of information
                    this work far surpasses the modest attempt of Laurenti, it shows no advance
                    towards a more natural division and arrangement of the genera. The author
                    depends entirely on conspicuous external characters, and classifies the reptiles
                    into (1) oviparous quadrupeds with a tail, (2) oviparous quadrupeds without a
                    tail, (3) oviparous</p>

                    (4) serpents,—an arrangement in which the old confusion of Batrachians and
                    reptiles and the imperfect definition of lizards and snakes are continued, and
                    which it is worthy of remark we find also adopted in Cuvier’s <hi rend="italic"
                        >TMeau élémentaire de Fhistoire naturelle des animaux</hi> (1798), and
                    nearly so by Latreille in his <hi rend="italic">Histoire naturelle des
                        reptiles</hi> (Paris, 1801, 4 vols. 12 mo). Lacépêde’s monograph, however,
                    remained for many years deservedly the standard work on reptiles. The numerous
                    plates with which the work is illustrated, are, for the time, well drawn, and
                    the majority readily recognizable.</p>
               <p>3. <hi rend="italic">The Period of Elimination of Batrachians as one of the
                        Reptilian Orders.</hi> —A new period for herpetology commences with Alex.
                    Brongniart, <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="6">
                        <hi rend="italic">Bull. Acad. Sci.</hi> (1800), Nos. 35, 36. </note> who in
                    1799 first recognized the characters by which Batrachians differ from the other
                    reptiles, and by which they form a natural passage to the class of fishes. <hi
                        rend="italic">Caecilia</hi> (as also <hi rend="italic">Langaha</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Acro-chordus)</hi> is left by Brongniart with hesitation in
                    the order of snakes, but newts and salamanders henceforth are no more classed
                    with lizards. He leaves the Batrachians, however, in the class of reptiles, as
                    the fourth order. The first order comprises the Chelonians, the second the
                    Saurians (including crocodiles and lizards), the third the Ophidians—terms which
                    have been adopted by all succeeding naturalists. Here, however, Brongniart’s
                    merit on the classification of reptiles ends, the definition and disposition of
                    the genera remaining much the same</p>
               <p>as in the works of his predecessors.</p>
               <p>The activity in France in the field of natural science was at this period, in
                    spite of the political disturbances, so great that only a few years after
                    Lacépède’s work another, almost identical in scope and of the same extent,
                    appeared, viz. the <hi rend="italic">Histoire naturelle générale el particulière
                        des reptiles</hi> of F. M. Daudin (Paris, 1802-3, 8 vols. 8vo). Written and
                    illustrated with less care than that by Lacépède, it is of greater importance to
                    the herpetologists of the present day, as it contains a considerable number of
                    generic and specific forms described for the first time. Indeed, at the end of
                    the work, the author states that he has examined more than eleven hundred
                    specimens, belonging to five hundred and seventeen species, all of which he has
                    described from nature. The system adopted is that of Brongniart, the genera are
                    well defined, but ill arranged; it is, however, noteworthy that <hi
                        rend="italic">Caecilia</hi> takes now its place at the end of the Ophidians,
                    and nearest to the succeeding order of</p>
               <p>Batrachians.</p>
               <p>The next step in the development of the herpetological system was the natural
                    arrangement of the genera. This involved a stupendous amount of labour. Although
                    many isolated contributions were made by various workers, this task could be
                    successfully undertaken and completed in the Paris Museum only, in which,
                    besides Seba’s and Lacépède’s collections, many other herpetological treasures
                    from other museums had been deposited by the victorious generals of the empire,
                    and to which, through Cuvier’s reputation, objects from every part of the world
                    were attracted in a voluntary manner. The men who devoted themselves to this
                    task were A. M. C. Duméril, Oppel and Cuvier himself. Oppel was a German who,
                    during his visit to Paris (1807-1808), attended the lectures of Duméril and
                    Cuvier, and at the same time studied the materials to which access was given to
                    him by the latter in the most liberal manner. Duméril <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="7">
                        <hi rend="italic">Erpét. gênér.,</hi> i. ρ. 259. </note> maintains that
                    OppeFs ideas and information were entirely derived from his lectures, and that
                    Oppel himself avows this to be the case. The passage, <note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="8"> “ Ware es nicht die Ermunterung . . .
                        dieser Freunde gewesen, so würde ich überzeugt von den Mängeln, denen eine

                        gewagt haben, <hi rend="italic">meine</hi> Eintheilung bekannt zu machen,

                        that the classification is based upon his own researches. </note> however,
                    to which he refers is somewhat ambiguous,</p>
               <p>and it is certain that there is the greatest possible difference between the
                    arrangement published by Duméril in 1806 <hi rend="italic">(Zoologie
                        Analytique,</hi> Paris, 8vo) and that proposed by Oppel in his <hi

                    i8rr,</p>
               <p>4to). There is no doubt that Oppel profited largely by the teaching of Duméril;
                    but, on the other hand, there is sufficient internal evidence in the works of
                    both authors, not only that Oppel worked independently, but also that Duméril
                    and Cuvier owed much to their younger fellow-labourer, as Cuvier himself indeed
                    acknowledges more than once.</p>

               <p>In this classification we notice three points, which indicate a decided progress
                    towards a natural system. (1) The four orders proposed by Brongniart are no more
                    considered cosubordinate in the class, but the Saurians and Ophidians are
                    associated as sections of the same order, a view held by Aristotle but abandoned
                    by all following naturalists. The distinction between lizards and snakes is
                    carried out in so precise a manner that one genus only, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Amphisbaena,</hi> is wrongly placed. (2) The true reptiles have now been
                    entirely divested of all heterogeneous elements by relegating positively <hi
                        rend="italic">CaecilIa</hi> to the Batrachians, a view for which Oppel had
                    been fully prepared by Duméril, who pointed out in 1807 that “ les cécilies se
                    rapprochent considérablement des batraciens auxquels elles semblent lier l’ordre
                    entier des serpens.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="9">
                        <hi rend="italic">Mémoires de zoologie et Panatomie comparée</hi> (Paris,
                        1807, 8vo), P- 45- </note> (3) An attempt is made at arranging the genera
                    into families, some of which are still retained at the present day.</p>
               <p>In thus giving a well-merited prominence to OppeFs labours we are far from
                    wishing to detract from the influence exercised by the master spirit of this
                    period, Cuvier. Without his guidance Oppel probably never would have found a
                    place among the promoters of herpetological science. But Cuvier’s principal
                    researches on reptiles were incidental or formed part of some more general plan;
                    Oppel concentrated his on this class only. Cuvier adopts the four orders of

                    groups, and the mode of dividing the latter has been retained to the present
                    day. Also a natural division of the snakes, although the foreign elements
                    mentioned are admitted . into the order, is sufficiently indicated by his

                    </note> who, endowed with an ardent imagination, only too frequently
                    misinterpreted the evidence of facts, or forced it into the service of
                    preconceived ideas. Cuvier had drawn attention to certain resemblances in</p>
               <p>some parts of the osseous structure of <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Ptero-dactylus</hi> to dolphins, birds, crocodiles,
                    &amp;c. Wagler, seizing upon such analogical resemblances, separated those
                    extinct Saurians from the class of Reptiles, and formed of them and the
                    Monotremes a distinct class of Vertebrates, intermediate between mammals and
                    birds, which he called Gryphi. We must admit that he made free use of his
                    imagination by defining his class of Gryphi as “ vertebrates with lungs lying
                    free in the pectoral cavity; oviparous development of the embryo (within or)
                    without the parent; the young fed (or suckled?) by the parents.” By the last
                    character this Waglcrian class is distinguished from the reptiles.</p>
               <p>Reptiles (in which Wagler includes Batrachians) arc divided into eight orders:
                    Testudines, Crocodili, Laeertae, Serpentes, Afigues, Caeciliae, Ranae and
                    Iehthyodi. He has great merit in having employed, for the subdivision of the
                    families of lizards, the structure of the tongue and the mode of insertion of
                    the teeth in the jaws. On the other hand, WagIer entirely failed in arranging
                    snakes in natural families, venomous and non-venomous types being mixed in the
                    majority of his groups.</p>
               <p>L. <hi rend="smallcaps">Fitzinger</hi> was Wagler’s contemporary; his first work
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="14">
                        <hi rend="italic">Neue Classification der Reptilien nach ihren natürlichen
                            Verwandtschaften</hi> (Vienna, 1826, 4to). </note> preceded Wagler’s
                    system by four years. As he says in the preface, his object was to arrange the
                    reptiles in “ a natural system.” Unfortunately, in order to attain this object,
                    Fitzinger paid regard to the most superficial points of resemblance; and in the
                        <hi rend="italic">tabula affinitatum generum</hi> which he constructed to
                    demonstrate “ the progress of nature ” he has been much more successful in
                    placing closely allied generic forms in contiguity than in tracing the
                    relationships of the higher groups. That table is prepared in the form of a
                    genealogical tree, but Fitzinger wished to express thereby merely the amount of
                    morphological resemblance, and there is no evidence whatever in the text that he
                    had a clear idea of genetic affinity. The Batraehians are placed at the bottom
                    of the scheme, leading through Hyla to the Geckos (clearly on account of the
                    digital dilatations) and through Caecilia to Amphisbaena. At the top Draco leads
                    through Pterodactylus to the Bats (Pteropus), Ichthyosaurus to the Cetaceans
                    (Del-phinus), Emys to the Monotremes, Testudo to Manis, and the Marine Turtles
                    to the Divers and Penguins.</p>
               <p>In Fitzinger’s system the higher groups are, in fact, identical with those
                    proposed by Merrem, while greater originality is shown in the subdivision of the
                    orders. He differed also widely from Wagler in his views as to the relations of
                    the extinct forms. The order of Loricata consists of two families, the
                    Ichthyosauroidea and Croco-diloidea, the former comprising Iguanodon,
                    Plesiosaurus, Sauro-cephalus and Ichthyosaurus. In the order Squamata
                    Lacertilians and Ophidians are combined and divided into twenty-two families,
                    almost all based on the most conspicuous external characters: the first two,
                    viz. the Geckos and Chameleons, arc natural enough, but in the three following
                    Iguanoids and Agamoids are sadly mixed, Pterodactyles and Draco forming one
                    family; Megalo-saurus, Mosasaurus, Varanus, Tejus, &amp;c., are associated
                    in another named Ameivoidea; the Amphisbaenidae are correctly defined; the
                    Colubroidea are a heterogeneous assemblage of thirty genera; but with his family
                    of Bungaroidea Fitzinger makes an attempt to separate at least a part of the
                    venomous Colubrine Snakes from the Viperines, which again are differentiated
                    from the last family, that of Crotaloidea.</p>
               <p>If this little work had been his only performance in the field of herpetology
                    his name would have been honourably mentioned among his fellow-workers. But the
                    promise of his early labours was not justified by his* later work, and if we
                    take notice of the latter here it is only because his name has become attached
                    to many a reptile through the pedantic rules of zoological nomenclature. The
                    labours of Wiegmann, Müller, Duméril and Bibron exercised no influence on him,
                    and when he commenced to publish a new system of reptiles in 1843, <note

                    which fortunately one fasciculus only appeared, he exhibited a classification in
                    which morphological facts are entirely superseded by fanciful ideas of the
                    vaguest kind of physiosophy, each class of vertebrates being divided</p>

                    forms of superior, the second of medium and the third of inferior development.
                    In the generic arrangement of the species, to which Fitzinger devoted himself
                    especially in this work, he equally failed to advance science.</p>
               <p>We have now arrived at a period distinguished by the appearance of a work which
                    superseded all its predecessors, which formed the basis for the labours of many
                    succeeding years, and which will always -remain one of the classical monuments
                    of descriptive zoology—the <hi rend="italic">Erpétologie générale ou histoire

                    first volume appeared in 1834, and the ninth and last in 1854. No naturalist of
                    that time could have been better qualified for the tremendous undertaking than
                    C. Duméril, who almost from the first year of half a century’s connexion with
                    the then largest collection of Reptilia had chiefly devoted himself to their
                    study. The task would have been too great for the energy of a single man; it
                    was, therefore, fortunate for Duméril that he found a most devoted
                    fellow-labourer in one of his assistants, G. Bibron, whose abilities equalled
                    those of the master, but who, to the great loss of science, died (in 1848)
                    before the completion of the work. Duméril had the full benefit of Bibron’s
                    knowledge for the volumes containing the Snakes, but the last volume, which
                    treats of the Tailed Batrachians, had to be prepared by Duméril</p>
               <p>alone.</p>
               <p>The work is the first which gives a comprehensive scientific account of reptiles
                    generally, their structure, physiology and literature, and again each of the
                    four orders admitted by the authors is introduced by a similar general account.
                    In the body of the work 121 Chelonians, 468 Saurians, 586 Ophidians and 218
                    Batrachians are described in detail and with the greatest precision. Singularly
                    enough, the authors revert to Brong-niart’s arrangement, in which the
                    Batrachians are co-ordinate with the other three orders of reptiles. This must
                    appear all the more strange as Von Baer <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    to two herpetologists, Blainville and Latreille, who advocated a deeper than
                    merely ordinal separation of Reptiles from Batrachians, and who were followed by
                    F. S. Leuckart. But this view only now began to find more general acceptance. J.
                        <hi rend="smallcaps">Müller</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Stannius</hi> were
                    guided in their classification entirely by anatomical characters, and
                    consequently recognized the wide gap which separates the Batrachians from the
                    Reptiles; yet they considered them merely as subclasses of the class Amphibia.

                    the biting muscles in the various groups of reptiles. This led to a series of
                    discussions which ended in the idea, that the class could be most naturally
                    divided into two great subclasses, the one culminating in tortoises and mammals,

               <p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">General Characters of the Class Reptilia</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Reptiles, as known in the existing world, are the modified, and in many respects
                    degenerate, representatives of a group of lung-breathing vertebrate animals
                    which attained its maximum development in the Mesozoic period. So far as can be
                    judged from the skeleton, some of the members of this group then living might
                    have become mammals by very slight change, while others might as readily have
                    evolved into birds. It is therefore probable that the class Reptilia, as now
                    understood, comprises the direct ancestors both of the Mammalia and Aves.
                    Assuming that its extinct members, which are known only by skeletons, were
                    organized essentially like its existing representatives, the class ranks higher
                    than that of the lowest five-toed vertebrates (class Batrachia) in the
                    investment of the foetus by two membranous envelopes (the amnion and allantois),
                    and in the total absence of gills even in the earliest embryos. It ranks below
                    both the Mammalia and Aves in the partial mixture of the arterial blood with the
                    venous blood as it leaves the heart, thus causing the organism to be
                    cold-blooded; it also differs both from Mammalia and Aves in retaining a pair of
                    aortic arches, of which only the left remains in the former, while the right one
                    is retained in the latter. No feature in the endoskeleton is absolutely
                    distinctive, except possibly the degeneration of the parasphenoid bone, which
                    separates the Reptilia from the Amphibia. In the exoskeleton, however, the
                    epidermis forms horny scales, such as never occur in Amphibia, while there are
                    no traces of any structures resembling either hairs or feathers, which
                    respectively characterize Mammalia and Aves.</p>
               <p>There is little doubt that true reptiles date back to the latter part of the
                    Palaeozoic period, but at that epoch the Amphibia approached them so closely in
                    the characters of the skeleton that it is difficult to distinguish the members
                    of the two classes among the fossils. Some of the Palaeozoic Amphibia—a few of
                    the so-called Labyrinthodonts—are proved to have had well-developed gill-arches
                    in their immature state, while there are conspicuous marks of slime-canals on
                    their skulls. Others are</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0142" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0165.jp2"/>
               <p>merely regarded as Amphibia because they closely resemble the genera which are
                    proved to have been gill-breathers when immature. All these genera, however, so
                    far as known, agree with the existing Amphibia in the production of their large
                    parasphenoid bone as far forwards as the vomers to form a rigid and complete
                    basicranial axis (fig. i, A). Those genera which less resemble the typical
                    Labyrinthodonts are characterized by the reduction of the parasphenoid bone so
                    that it no longer reaches the vomers; in these animals the weakened skull
                    exhibits a secondary basicranial axis formed by the approximation of the
                    pterygoids to the median line (fig. i, B). The latter condition is universal in
                    existing reptiles, and may therefore perhaps be regarded as a diagnostic
                    feature. If so, the oldest known undoubted reptile is <hi rend="italic"
                        >Palaeohalleria,</hi> from the Lower Permian of Saxony.</p>
               <p>In the structure of the skull <hi rend="italic">Palaeohatteria</hi> is much Hke
                    the existing <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> the cheek-plates which cover the
                    temporal and masseter muscles on each side being pierced by two great vacuities,
                    one superior-temporal, the other lateral-temporal. The majority of the earliest
                    reptiles, however, either resemble the Labyrinthodonts in having the biting
                    muscles completely covered with a roof of bony plates, or exhibit a slight
                    shrinkage, of this investment so that a superior-temporal vacuity appears. As
                    the various groups or orders become differentiated, this shrinkage or reduction
                    continues, while the shape of the ossifying ear-capsule changes, and the
                    squamosal bone, which covers the organ of hearing in the fishes, and presumably
                    also in the Palaeozoic Batrachia, is gradually thrust outwards from all
                    connexion with this capsule except at its hinder angle. The resultant
                    modifications are diagrammatically represented in fig 2. In one series of
                    orders, comprising the Anomodontia, Chelonia, Sauropterygia and Ichthyopterygia
                    (fig. 2, B, C), the superior-temporal vacuity (s) first appears, and the
                    cheek-plates in the broad temporal arch thus formed may be variously fused
                    together, sometimes even irregularly perforated—showing at first, indeed, the
                    usual inconstancy of a new and not completely established feature. From the
                    earliest members of this series of reptiles, palaeontology seems to demonstrate
                    that the Mammalia (with one robust temporal arcade or zygomatic arch) arose. In
                    a second series, comprising the orders Rhyncho-cephalia, Dinosauria, Crocodilia
                    and Ornithosauria (fig. 2, D) <hi rend="sub">;</hi> the broad arch of
                    cheek-plates is regularly pierced by a lateral-temporal vacuity, which leaves a
                    narrow bar above, another narrow bar below, and uncovers the middle part of the
                    quadrate bone. By the constant loss of the lower, and the frequent loss of the
                    upper, bar, some members of this series eventually pass into the order Squamata
                    (Lacertilia-FOphidia), in which the quadrate bone is completely exposed and
                    loosely attached to the skull (fig. 2, E); other reptiles exhibiting a similar
                    modification may readily have acquired the typical Avian skull (fig. 2, F) by
                    the loss of the upper and the retention of the lower</p>
               <p>temporal bar in question.</p>
               <p>In view of these and other palaeontological considerations, the Reptilia may be
                    classified into orders as follows :—</p>

                    They are precisely intermediate between the</p>
               <p>Labyrinthodont Batrachia and the lowest or Monotreme Mammalia. They flourished
                    at the period when the former are known to have reached their culmination, and
                    when the latter almost certainly began to appear. Many of them would, indeed, be
                    regarded as primitive Mammalia, if they did not retain a pineal foramen, a free
                    quadrate bone, and a complex mandible. The term Theromorpha or Theromora is thus
                    sometimes applied to the order they represent. So far as known, they are all
                    land-reptiles, with limbs adapted for habitual support of the body, and their
                    feet are essentially identical with those of primitive mammals. Most of them are
                    small, and none attain a gigantic size. They first appear in the Permian of
                    Europe and North America, and also occur in the Triassic both of Europe</p>
               <p>and India, but they are best represented in the Karoo formation (Permian and

                    acquired elongated paddles and vacuities in the shell during the Cretaceous
                    period, and the Trionychia, destitute of epidermal shields, apparently arose at

               <p>genera, and the neck is usually elongated though not flexible. The tail is
                    insignificant, generally short, and both pairs of paddles seem to have been
                    concerned in progression. The order appears to have arisen from a group of

               <p>Anomodontia, and the shape of the scapula seems to show some connexion with the

               <p>effective paddles with elongated digits, and as the genera are traced upwards in
                    the geological formations it is possible to observe how .the arches supporting
                    the limbs become more rigid until the maximum of strength is reached. A few
                    genera, such as <hi rend="italic">Pliosaurus</hi> from the Jurassic and <hi

                    distinguished by their relatively large head and stout neck. Some of the largest
                    Upper Jurassic and Cretaceous species must have been 10 metres in length. They
                    were cosmopolitan in their distribution, but became extinct before the dawn of
                    the Tertiary period.</p>
               <p>Order 4. <hi rend="smallcaps">Ichthyopterygia.</hi> —The Ichthyosaurians are all
                    fish-shaped, with a relatively large head and very short neck. Both pairs of
                    paddles are retained, but the hinder pair is usually very small, and locomotion
                    seems to have been chiefly effected by a large caudal fin. This fin, as shown in
                    impression by certain fossils from Württemberg and Bavaria, is a vertical,
                    triangular, dermal expansion, without any skeletal support except the hindermost
                    part of the attenuated vertebral column, which extends along the border of its
                    lower lobe (fig. 5). Another triangular fin, without skeletal support, is known
                    to occur on the back, at least in one species (fig. 5). Some of the genera are
                    proved to have been viviparous.· Like the Sauropterygia, the Ichthyopterygia
                    appear to have originated from terrestrial ancestors, for their earliest
                    Triassic representatives <hi rend="italic">(Mixosaurus)</hi> have the teeth less
                    uniform and the limbs slightly less paddleshaped than the latter genera. In this
                    connexion it is noteworthy that their hollow conical teeth exhibit curious
                    infoldings of the wall, like those observed in many Labyrinthodonts, while their
                    short, biconcave vertebrae almost exactly resemble those of the Labyrinlhodont
                        <hi rend="italic">Maslodonsaurus</hi> and its allies. As the Ichthyosaurs
                    are traced upwards in geological time, some genera become almost, or quite,
                    toothless, while the paddles grow wider, and are rendered more flexible by the

               <p>Order 6. <hi rend="smallcaps">Dinosauria.</hi> —The dinosaurs arc land reptiles
                    which flourished on all the continents during the Jurassic and Cretaceous
                    periods, in the interval between the decline of the Anomodontia and the
                    dominance of the Mammalia. They first appeared as carnivorous reptiles in the
                    Triassic period in Europe, India, S. Africa, and N. America, but afterwards
                    comprised numerous massive herbivores in nearly all parts of the world except
                    the Australian and New Zealand regions. The skeleton in the carnivorous
                    dinosaurs, or Theropoda, is of very light construction, the vertebrae and limb
                    bones being hollow, with thin, dense walls and often perfectly fitting joints.
                    The fore limbs are small, and the hind limbs are adapted for running, jumping or
                    hopping on the toes. The sabre-shaped cutting teeth are fixed in sockets, and
                    all the claws are sharp. <hi rend="italic">Anchisaurus</hi> and <hi

                    U.S.A., has a skull more than a metre in length. The herbivorous Dinosaurs of
                    the suborder Ornithopoda resemble the Theropoda in general shape, but are
                    heavier in build, with a pelvis constructed more nearly on the plan of that of a
                    running bird. It has, indeed, been suggested that certain arboreal Dinosaurs of
                    bipedal gait may have been the ancestors of the class Aves. The best-known
                    Ornithopod is <hi rend="italic">Iguanodon</hi> (fig. 7), from the Wealden of W.
                    Europe, with species from 5 to 10 metres in length. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Claosaurus,</hi> from the Cretaceous of N. America, is</p>
               <p>nearly similar, and is represented by at least one complete skeleton in the Yale
                    University Museum. There are also members of the same group with a heavy armour
                    of bony plates and spines, sometimes termed Stegosauria. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Stegosaurus</hi> itself occurs in the Upper Jurassic of Colorado, and <hi

                    England, is a nearly similar reptile. <hi rend="italic">Polacanthus,</hi> from
                    the Wcalden of the Isle of Wight, has the hip-region armoured with a continuous
                    bony shield. <hi rend="italic">Triceratops</hi> (fig. 8) and its allies, from
                    the Upper Cretaceous (Laramie) of western N. America, are the latest members of
                    the group, with a bony frill over the neck, a pair of bony horn-cores above the
                    eyes, and a median bony horn-core on the nose. The skull with the bony frill
                    sometimes measures nearly two metres in length. Another suborder of herbivorous
                    Dinosaurs, that of Sauropoda, comprises the largest known land animals of any
                    age, some measuring from 17 to 25 metres in total length. They have a small
                    head, long neck, and long tail, and must have been quadrupedal in gait. Their
                    teeth are adapted for feeding on succulent water weeds, perhaps with an
                    admixture of small ammâls living among these; and their vertebrae are of very
                    light construction, while the ribs are raised high on the neural arches to
                    increase the size of the body cavity, perhaps for unusually large lungs or air
                    sacs. Their massive limbs have five toes, of which the three inner alone bear
                    outwardly curved claws. <hi rend="italic">Diplodocus</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Brontosaurus,</hi> from the Jurassic of Wyoming and Colorado, U.S.A., are

                    secondary bony plate less extended backwards than that in the Tertiary and
                    existing genera, while their vertebrae have flattened or concave ends, instead
                    of exhibiting a ball-and-socket articulation. Some of the Upper Jurassic
                    crocodiles <hi rend="italic">(Metriorhynchus)</hi> were more truly aquatic than
                    any now living, with the fore limbs degenerate, the hind limbs much enlarged for
                    swimming, and the dermal armour lacking. The end of the vertebral column is bent
                    downwards, as in <hi rend="italic">Ichthyosaurus,</hi> so they doubtless
                    possessed a similar triangular tail-fin. Typical crocodiles and alligators date
                    back to the close of the Cretaceous period, and they did not become extinct in
                    Europe until the beginning of the Miocene period. Remains of an extinct
                    alligator <hi rend="italic">(Diplocynodon)</hi> are common in the Upper Eocene

                    which have been found in Europe, N. America and Brazfl. Some of these <hi

                    that for adequate support the pectoral arch is fixed to the vertebrae like a
                    peIvis. The wings occasionally have a span of from 5 to 6 metres. The

               <p>Order 9. Squamata.—The ancestors of the lizards and snakes can only be traced
                    back definitely to the latter part of the Cretaceous period. They were then
                    represented by two* suborders of aquatic reptiles, the Dolichosauria and
                    Pythono-morpha(or Mosasauria) ,which are in many respects intermediate between
                    the existing Lacertilia and Ophidia. The Dolichosauria, from the Upper
                    Cretaceous of Europe, are small and snake-like</p>
               <p>in shape, but with completely formed limbs. The Pythono-morpha are known from
                    Europe, N. and S. America and New Zealand, and sometimes attained a very large
                    size, the typical <hi rend="italic">Mosasaurus camperi</hi> from Maastricht
                    being about 15 metres in length. Their limbs are powerful paddles. Their trunk

               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> has the most primitive and still most complex
                    skull, the salient features of which it is easy to derive from Stegocephalian
                    and early, generalized reptilian conditions; whilst in other directions, mostly
                    by reduction, the skull of this “living fossil” affords the key to that of all
                    the other groups of at least recent reptiles. The main features are the
                    following. There are, in the temporal region, three complete bony arches,</p>
               <p>the supra-, infra-, and post-temporal, which subdivide the whole temporal fossa
                    into four foramina. The supratemporal bridge is formed by the squamosal and
                    post-orbital, the latter (Jin fig. 12) being continued forwards and fused with
                    the post-frontal.</p>
               <p>These thrée bones, with the parietal,.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="sup">1</hi> enclose the supra-temporal foramen. the postorbital joins
                    an ascending branch of the jugal, both together forming the hinder border of the
                    orbit, and this is bordered below chiefly by the maxillary. The
                    pos-teriortemporal bridge is formed by the parietal and squamosal, extends
                    laterally over the quadrate and encloses a wide space between itself and the
                    buttress-like transverse expansion of the lateral occipital</p>

                    opisthotic bones); this is the posttemporal foramen. The space enclosed between
                    this occipital buttress, the quadrate and the ptcrygoidal support of the latter
                    represents the wide and large cavity of the middle ear,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0148" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0171.jp2"/>
               <p>and as such is crossed by the auditory columellar chain. The infra-temporal
                    bridge or jugal arch is formed by the jugal <hi rend="italic">(qj</hi> in fig.
                    12), which joins the descending process of the squamosal, and the
                    quadrato-jugal, which is very small and partly fused with the lateral side of
                    the quadrate. Now, between the quadrate on the one side and the
                    squamoso+quadrato-jugal+jugal on the other, is enclosed a gap, met with only in
                        <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> of recent reptiles. This fourth, or
                    quadrato-squamosal foramen, with its squamoso-quadrato-jugal bridge, is, as a
                    rule, not mcntloned, being too small to be obvious. The quadrate is very firmly
                    fixed. On the ventral side of the cranium we notice the broad and long bony
                    palate, the large vomers, and the pterygoids meeting in the middle fine; aside
                    of the vomers are the long posterior nares; posteriorly the pterygoids diverge
                    to rest upon short basi-sphenoid processes, and they articulate by short flanges
                    with the quadrates.</p>
               <p>*The occipital condyle is kidney-shaped, triple, composed of the basi and the
                    lateral occipitals. The dorsal median roof of the cranium is formed by the
                    paired parietals, near their anterior symphysis with the large pineal foramen,
                    the paired frontals, nasals and premaxillaries. The outer nares are surrounded
                    by the premaxillaries, maxillaries and nasals. Prefrontals and postfrontals
                    exist. There is a* complete cartilaginous, interorbital septum, and a cranial
                    columella, a pair of upright buttresses arising in the alisphenoidal walls,
                    connecting the parietals with the pterygoids. The hyoid apparatus consists of a
                    narrow base, with three pairs of arches; of these the first or hyoid arch is
                    variously connected with the cranium near the paroccipital process, or with the
                    extracolumella (see <hi rend="italic">Middle Ear,</hi> below) ; the others are a
                    long and stout pair of first and a smaller pair of second branchial arches.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Crocodiles.—</hi> The temporal region is still bridged over by
                    three arches, dividing the whole fossa into three, very much as in <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphenodon.</hi> The supratemporal foramen is bordered by the
                    parietal, postfrontal (postorbital absent) and squamosal. The posttemporal
                    foramen is very much reduced, sometimes to a narrow passage between the
                    parietal, occipitals and squamosal, because the latter bone forms an extensive
                    suture with the paroccipital process. The infratemporal or lateral fossa is wide
                    and rather shallow, bordered above by the postfrontal and squamosal, in front by
                    the postfrontal and jugal, below by the jugal and quadrato-jugal, behind by the
                    latter, the quadrate, tip of the paroccipital and the squamosal. The
                    quadrato-jugal being long and in an almost horizontal position, being wedged in
                    between the jugal and nearly the whole length of the lateral edge of the
                    quadrate, and there being no squamoso-quadrato-jugal bridge, the fourth foramen
                    of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> is absent. The middle-ear cavity is reduced
                    to a complicated system of narrow passages; one for the passage of the
                    extra-columellar-mandi-bular string of the auditory chain (see <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ear,</hi> below), between the quadrate, paroccipital and lateral occipital
                    bones; another passage <hi rend="italic">(Eustachian)</hi> opens in the roof of
                    the mouth, between basioccipital and basisphenoid; a .third joins that of the
                    other side and forms with it a median opening between the same bones, just
                    behind the posterior pterygoid border of the choanae. These nares, being in the
                    recent crocodiles shifted as far back as possible, communicate with the outer
                    nostrils by very long passages, formed by the whole length of the pterygoids,
                    palatines, maxillaries, vomers and pre-maxillaries, all of which form a long
                    median suture. But this long bony palatal roof is interrupted by a pair of large
                    palatal foramina, bordered usually by palatine, Pterygoid, ectopterygoid, or
                    transverse bone and maxillary. On the dorsal side of the cranium we notice the
                    parietals fused into an unpaired bone, without a pineal hole and the likewise
                    unpaired frontal. There are a pair of postfrontals, prefrontals and Iacrymals
                    perforated by the naso-lacrymal duct. The nasals vary much in length, mostly in
                    conformity with that of the maxillaries; as a rule they reach the short
                    premaxillaries; but not always the nasal groove. (For taxonomic detail see under
                    Crocodile.)</p>
               <p>The occipital condyle is formed mainly by the basioccipital, which always
                    borders part of the foramen magnum, but the lateral occipitals each send a
                    flange to it, which in immature specimens still partakes of the articulation
                    with the atlas. The opisthotic and epiotic bones fuse early with the lateral and
                    with Supraoccipital bones; only the proötic remains longer as a separate
                    element, anteriorly with a large hole for the exit of the third branch of the
                    trigeminal nerve. The basisphenoid is scarcely visible, being overlaid by the
                    pterygoids. The presphenoid is larger, continued forwards and upwards into the
                    inter-orbital septum, which remains mostly cartilaginous. Near the anterior and
                    upper margin of the pre-sphenoid is a large notch on either side for the passage
                    of the optic nerve, the three eye-muscle nerves and the first branch of the
                    trigeminal. The place of the Orbitosphenoids is taken by membrane or
                    cartilaginous continuations of the interorbital septum, but the alisphenoids are
                    large and abut upwards against the frontals and with a lateral flange against
                    the postfrontals. These send down a conspicuous process which forms sutures with
                    an upward process of the jugal and another of the ectopterygoid; it is this
                    compound pillar which partly divides the orbit from the infratemporal or lateral
                    fossa. The size of these and the upper temporal fossae stand in an inverse ratio
                    to each other. The upper fossae are still comparatively large in the
                    long-snouted <hi rend="italic">Gavialis</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tomis-toma,</hi> whilst these holes almost completely disappear in the
                    alligators, namely, in the broad- and short-snouted members of the order, which
                    chew their prey. In extinct Crocodilians the upper fossae were the larger. The
                    temporo-mandibular muscle which lifts or shuts the lower jaw arises from the
                    walls of the upper fossa, passes beneath the jugal-arch and is inserted upon the
                    supra-angular portion of the lower jaw. In the more recent crocodiles this
                    muscle is more and more superseded by the pterygo-mandibular muscle, which,
                    arising chiefly from the dorsal surface of the much-broadened pterygoid, fills
                    the widened space between the latter and the quadrate, and is inserted into the
                    outer surface of the angular bone. The arrangement of this muscle secures a more
                    advantageous leverage of the jaw, and is capable of more powerful development
                    than the other, which is consequently on the wane—a nice illustration of onward,
                    ortho-genetic evolution. The dentary bones of the under jaw form a suture, later
                    a symphysis; this is very long in the long-snouted genera, in which the
                    splenials likewise form a long symphysis; in the others the mandibular symphysis
                    is much shorter and the splenials remain widely separated. Thearticular bone is
                    short, forms a transverse cup for the quadrate, or a saddle-shaped cup, and is
                    perforated by the <hi rend="italic">Siphonium</hi> (see below under <hi
                        rend="italic">Ear).</hi> The angle is upturned, formed by the articular,
                    angular and, laterally, by the supra-angular bone; the opercular or counterpart
                    of the splenial lies on the outer side, forming part of the anterior border of
                    the oval foramen in the jaw.</p>
               <p>The Chelonian skull agrees in many important features with that of <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and of the crocodiles, but it is composed of
                    fewer bones, the ectopterygoids, Iacrymals and postorbitals being absent, often
                    also the nasals, unless they are fused with the prefrontals. The vomer is
                    unpaired and forms a septum between the nasal passages, which, except in <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphargis,</hi> are ventrally roofed over to a variable extent
                    by wings sent out by the palatines, joining the sides of the vomer. Most of the
                    configurations of the other cramai bones are well represented in the
                    accompanying figures. The palatines form a continuous broad floor with the
                    pterygoids, which are extensively and firmly joined to the quadrates and to tbe
                    basisphenoid. There are no Eustachian tubes. The occipital condyle is distinctly
                    triple and the basioccipital is frequently excluded from the foramen magnum. The
                    lateral occipitals early send out a pair of stout wings, the ventral of which
                    joins a stout Ventrilateral process of the basioccipital, both forming a thick
                    knob especially in <hi rend="italic">Chelone,</hi> and a dorsolateral wing,
                    which broadly joins the large opisthotic bone. This connects the lateral
                    occipital and the Supraoccipital with the upper portion of the quadrate. On the
                    top of the quadrate and upon the lateral dorsal portion of this compound
                    transverse process (which of course corresponds to the paroccipital process of
                    crocodiles, &amp;c.) lies the squamosal, about which more presently. The two
                    wings of the lateral</p>

                    form the bony borders of the middle ear-cavity,</p>
               <p>which is open behind; through it extends horizontally the columellar rod,
                    received with its outer portion by a notch on the posterior side of the
                    quadrate. This is of very complicated shape. Its outer margins form most of the
                    tympanic frame; the posterior margins being curved backwards leave a wide notch
                    behind in the Cryptodira and in <hi rend="italic">Sphargis,</hi> but in the
                    Pleurodira this part of the quadrate is transformed into a trumpet, the rim of
                    which, forming a complete ring, carries the tympanic membrane. The tympanic
                    cavity thus formed often leads into a deep recess which extends into the
                    hollowed-out squamosal <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Testudo)</hi> towards the opisthotic and bears some resemblance to the
                    intricate tympanic recesses which pervade that region of the crocodile’s skull.
                    With its upper anterior and</p>
               <p>inner portion the quadrate joins the large proötic bone which is usually
                    completely fused with the rest of the opisthotic, but in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphargis</hi> it remains separate, and in this turtle the sutures between
                    the otic bones and the Supraoccipital also persist. In front of the prootics the
                    bony lateral walls of the brain-case end in <hi rend="italic">Sphargis,</hi>
                    but· in most of the other Chelonians bony alisphenoids are represented by a pair
                    of epipterygoids which rest upon short upward processes of the pterygoids and
                    are joined by much longer, rather thin, but broad descending lamellae from</p>
               <p>the parietals. They represent of course the columcllae cranii or Pterygoidal
                    columcllae; if they are of alisphenoidal origin the term epipterygoids is a
                    misnomer; the same applies to these structures in other reptiles. Through the
                    space enclosed by the pterygoid, basioccipital, opisthotic and quadrate, enters
                    the cranial carotid artery, sometimes piercing the posterior rim of the
                    pterygoid; then the canal runs along the dorsal side of this bone and opens near
                    the cranial columella. the arcades over the temporal region arc most variable.
                    Potentially Chelonians possess all the three arcades of the crocodiles, but it
                    so happens that never more than one fenestra is present. The false roof over the
                    temporal region is most complete in <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi> and in the
                        <hi rend="italic">Chelonidae.</hi> Excepting <hi rend="italic">Sphargis
                        the</hi> Supraoccipital extends far beyond the back of the cranium in shape
                    of a long unpaired crest, which never diverges, or sends out lateral processes,
                    but it is joined, and partly overlaid for a great part of its length, by the
                    parietals in <hi rend="italic">Chelonidae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphargis.</hi> In these genera the much-enlarged parietal, the equally
                    large postfrontal, with the squamosal behind, the jugal below, and a large
                    quadrato-jugal, form one continuous bony roof over the whole temporal fossa,
                    which is widely open behind, the space being bordered by Supraoccipital,
                    opisthotic, squamosal and parietal. All other Chclonians show a great reduction
                    of this roof. the parietal does not send out dorsolateral expansions; and the
                    postfrontal likewise forms no expansions. It joins the rather short malar,
                    forming the posteriororbital bridge, which posteriorly is connected by the
                    quadrato-jugal with the upper portion of the quadrate and with the squamosal.
                    The latter rests upon the quadrate and is in no connexion with the parietal.</p>
               <p>Consequently the whole temporal fossa is quite open. The horizontal bridge or
                    arcade is to a certain extent homologous with the infra-temporal arcade. All the
                    bones which border the temporal fossa vary much in extent. The greatest
                    reduction has taken place in <hi rend="italic">Cistudo</hi> and in <hi
                        rend="italic">Geoemyda <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> the latter an Indian genus of Testudinidae, in which the quadrato-jugal is

                    the jugal or malar bone.</p>
               <p>The mandibular halves form a complete osseous symphysis, the only instance in
                    reptiles; all the other elements retain their sutures. The articular portion of
                    the articular bone forms several shallow cups and a slight anterior knob, best
                    developed in <hi rend="italic">Chelone.</hi> The angular bone does not help to
                    form the posterior upper angle. The coronoid, or complementary element, is often
                    small; the supra-angular and the splenial or opercular are always present,
                    mostly also a pre-splenial wanting in Testudinidae (cf. G. Baur).</p>
               <p>The hyoid apparatus is well developed, and sometimes assumes large dimensions,
                    especially in <hi rend="italic">Chelys.</hi> The two pairs of “ horns ” are the
                    first and second branchial arches, whilst the hyoid arches are reduced to a pair
                    of small, frequently only cartilaginous nodules, attached near the anterior
                    corners of the basis linguae, which generally fuses with the os entoglossum in
                    the tip of the tongue. In Chelydidae the long median basal or copular piece
                    forms a semi-canal for the reception of the trachea.</p>
               <p>In the skull of the Lacertilia the arcades over the temporal region vary much in
                    composition and numbers. There are at most two arcades and two windows. First
                    the posttemporal arcade, enclosing the posttemporal fenestra, which is. framed
                    mainly by the large paroccipital process below and the long parietal process
                    above, both meeting distally, and the quadrate is carried by the paroccipital
                    process. In the corner, in front, where the three bones meet, lies the
                    squamosal, connecting parietal and quadrate. This squamosal, when not too much</p>
               <p>reduced, has an upper parietal and an anterior horizontal arm ; the latter is
                    essential for the formation of the second horizontal arcade, which makes the
                    lower border of the supra-temporal window. The infra-temporal arcade, namely a
                    quadrato-jugal +jugal arch, is absent in all Laccrtilians owing to the complete
                    absence of the quadrato-jugal element.</p>
               <p>In <hi rend="italic">Heloderma</hi> and Geckos the posttemporal is the only
                    arcade. In the Amphisbaenids and in <hi rend="italic">Aniella,</hi> practically
                    also in <hi rend="italic">Anelytropsis,</hi> all the arcades are lost. All the
                    other families of lizards and the chameleons have two arcades. We begin the
                    description of the horizontal arcade with those families in which it is most
                    complete, and most like that of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon.</hi> In <hi
                        rend="italic">Varanus</hi> it is formed by four bones. The postfrontal is
                    short; to it is attached the postorbital, which sends a long horizontal process

                        n="26"> There is a much-debated question of the homologies, of the one or
                        two elements, both apparently membrane bones, which connect the upper end of
                        the quadrate with the parietal and with the supra-temporal arch. The
                        question becomes acute in the snakes, whether the single element connecting
                        skull and quadrate has to be called squamosal or supratemporal. Space
                        forbids here to expound the matter, which has been very ably reviewed by S.
                        W. .WilIiston (“ Temporal Arches in the Reptiha,” <hi rend="italic">Biolog.
                            Bulletin,</hi> vii. No. 4, 1904, pp. 175-192;\:f. also F. W. Thyng, <hi

                        different names have been applied to these two elements, and two, namely,
                        squamosal and supratemporal, are being used quite promiscuously. When only
                        one element is present, the present writer uses the term squamosal, and
                        there are reasons making it probable that this element is the squamosum of
                        mammals. When both elements are present, the more ventral or lateral of the
                        two is termed squamosal, that which always helps to form the </note> splint,
                    and this connects with the</p>

               <p>upper anterior end of the quadrate; between the quadrate, the squamosaI and the
                    long parietal process lies the likewise splint-like supratemporal, attached by
                    most of its length to the parietal process. The jugal has only one arm, and this
                    connects the maxilla with the postorbital, completing the posterior orbital
                    border. There is a wide gap between jugal and quadrate. In Tejidae the arcade is
                    the same, but the squamosal reaches the jugal, both meeting the postorbital. In
                        <hi rend="italic">Lacerta</hi> the arcade is essentially the same, but the
                    window is completely filled up by the postfrontal, which extends so far back as
                    to reach the supra-temporal. In the Agamidae the arcade is strong and
                    simplified. Postfrontal and postorbital are represented by one forked piece.
                    This squamosal and the postfrontal mass are connected by the upper, miich
                    up-curved end of· the jugal, which is thrust between them. This arrangement is
                    further emphasized in <hi rend="italic">Iguana,</hi> the upper end of the jugal
                    being much enlarged so as to form the greater portion of the arcade, and keeping
                    the postfrontal mass and the simple squamosal widely asunder. In Heloderma post-
                    and prefrontals are in contact with each other, separating the frontal bone from
                    the orbit; the jugal joins only the prefrontal, and there is no further arcade
                    whatever. A vestige of a supra temporal (?) lies on the outside of the base of
                    the squamosal, between i and</p>

               <p>The chameleons are peculiar. The posttemporal arcade, spanning a wide space, is
                    formed by a long process of the supra-temporal - squamosal, which is directed
                    up-and backwards to join the parietal, which extends back by a long unpaited
                    process. The horizontal arch is broad and short, squamosal and postfrontal,
                    forming a broad suture; below they are joined by the jugal; above the suture
                    lies, in chameleon, a tiny piece, perhaps a vestige of the dislodged post</p>
               <p>orbital.</p>
               <p>The jugal bones, to continue the description of the appendicular parts of the
                    skull, are firmly joined to lateral processes of the pterygoids by the
                    ectopterygoids; further forwards they are extensively connected with the
                    maxillaries. These rest against strong transverse palatine processes. The
                    palatines form a medium symphysis; posteriorly they diverge together with the
                    pterygoids, which articulate with the quad-Supratemporal bridge, generally with
                    the postorbital, sometimes also with the jugal. The more dorsal element is
                    mentioned as supratemporal ; it is always smaller, and mostly restricted to the
                    corner between the squamosal and the parietal process against which it rests.
                    Either of these two elements articulate with the quadrate. Both elements are
                    present in Labyrinthodonts and in most of the extinct groups of reptiles; among
                    recent forms in Lacertidae, Varanidae, Tejidae; one three-armed piece in <hi

               <p>rates and with the basisphenoid by a pair of strong basiptery-goid processes. A
                    slender vertical rod of bone, the columella cranii, arises from the dorsal
                    surface of each pterygoid and, passing at a distance from the cranial capsule,
                    is sutured to a short lateroventral process of the parietals Such a pair of
                    columellæ exists in nearly all Lacertilia (distinguished by many systematists as
                        <hi rend="italic">KionocraniP)</hi> with the exception of the chameleons and
                    the Amphisbaenidae. In many lizards, however, this columella, or epipterygoid,
                    does not quite reach the parietal, leaning instead against the proötic; possibly
                    it has been evolved out of the alisphenoid, and Chelonians seem to support this
                    view. The premaxillary bone is single, except in the Skinks and in some Geckos;
                    ventrally it touches the vomers which vary much in size; they are always paired
                    although suturally connected; posteriorly they pass into, and fuse with, the
                    palatines before these send off their maxillary processes. Between the vomer and
                    its maxillary is a longitudinal hole. Often, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in <hi
                        rend="italic">Lacerla,</hi> the vomers enclose a median hole near their
                    anterior end, for Jacobson’s organ. DorsalIy the premaxilla sends a median
                    process backwards to the nasals. These are paired, and fuse together only in <hi
                        rend="italic">Uroplates</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Varanus.</hi> The
                    external nasal fossae are sometimes very large, and their anterior half appears
                    blocked by the ossified turbinals, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in <hi
                        rend="italic">Varanus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tejus.</hi> Prefrontals are
                    always present, often fused with the lacrymals; in Heloderma, in Aniella and in
                    chameleons the prefrontals extend so far back as to meet the postfrontals,
                    excluding thereby the frontals from the orbital rim. The frontals are either
                    paired, as in Varanus, Lacertidae, Heloderma, Anguidae, Scincidae <hi rend="sub"
                        >i</hi> Anelytropsidae, Aniella, Amphis-baenidae, and in some Geckoninae; or
                    they are fused into one bone, as in the Eublepharinae, chameleons, Tejidae,
                    Iguanidae, Agamidae, <hi rend="italic">Xenosaurus.</hi> The parietals are double
                    in the Geckos, in <hi rend="italic">Uroplates</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Xantusia*,</hi> in all the others they form one coössified mass, generally

                    Aniella and other degraded forms. In the majority the pineal foramen lies in the
                    middIe of the parietaI, but in the Iguanidae it is near the frontal, and
                    actually in the frontal in chameleons.</p>
               <p>As regards the brain-case, there is a cartilaginous interorbital septum,
                    connected posteriorly with the slender, bony presphenoid; ventrally on to this
                    is fused a vestige of the parasphenoid, a narrow and thin splint which sometimes
                    can be dislodged. The whole of the anterior wall of the brain-case is
                    membranous, excepting a pair of separate ossifications, which do but rarely
                    touch any of the cranial bones, as frontal, parietal or prootics. The
                    ossifications are irregular in shape, each sending out a downward process which
                    curves inwards almost to meet its fellow; between these issue the olfactory
                    lobes. W. K. Parker recognized them as the alisphenoids; E. D. Cope named them
                    postoptics, and remarked that in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> they coexist
                    with an. Orbitosphenoid bone. The proötic has a notch in its anterior lateral
                    margin for the passage of the trigeminal nerve. The opisthotic portion of the
                    petrosal mass is intimately fused with the lateral occipital bones and their
                    paroccipital process, and sometimes, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Tejus <hi rend="sub"
                            > 1</hi></hi> encloses with them many intricate recesses of the middle ear-chamber,
                    which extend also into hollow and swollen thick downward processes of the
                    basioccipital. These cavities of both sides communicate with each other through
                    the cancellous substance of the basioccipital and basisphenoid. There are no
                    Eustachian tubes opening into the mouth through the base of the skull.</p>
               <p>The occipital condyle is tripartite, the lateral occipitals partaking of the
                    articulation; very rarely, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in Amphis-baenidae (see
                    fig. 22), the basioccipital portion is so much reduced that the skull
                    articulates, by two very broad condyles.</p>
               <p>The halves of the under jaw are but loosely united, either by ligament only or
                    by an at least very movable suture. The jaw is compound and the numerous
                    constituent bones mostly retain their sutures. Besides the dentary and
                    articular, angular and supra-angular on the lateral side, and the opercular or
                    splenial on the inner side, there lies on the dorsal side the coronoid, six
                    pairs in all. The posterior angle of the jaw</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0152" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0175.jp2"/>
               <p>is always formed by the articular bone, not by the angular which lies on the
                    ventral side, about the middle of the jaw; it is fused with the articuIar in
                    Geckos, some Tejidae, Amphis-baenidae, and some other burrowing kinds. The
                    splenial is absent in chameleons; near the vanishing point in some of the
                    Agamidae. The coronoid is always present, for the insertion of masseter muscles.
                    In the pleurodont lizards the outer wall of the dentary forms a ledge, against
                    the inner side of which are fixed the teeth with</p>
               <p>cementum.</p>
               <p>The snakes’</p>
               <p>skull shows many peculiarities, and most of the bones of the cranial capsule
                    fuse together without sutures. The occipital condyle is triple, the lateral
                    occipitals and the basioccipital taking equal share in its composition; the
                    basioccipital is excluded from the foramen magnum ; frequently one common
                    epiphysial pad covers this tripartite condyle. The supra-occipital is likewise
                    excluded from the margin of the foramen magnum by the lateral occipitals. The
                    basisphenoid is prolonged forwards into a long presphenoidal rostrum, on the
                    upper surface of which the trabeculae cranii, which persist as cartilages,
                    extend forwards to blend with the median ethmoidal cartilage. There are no ali-
                    and no orbitosphenoids, their places being taken by downward extensions of the
                    frontal bones, which descend to this sphenoidal rostrum and then turn inwards to
                    meet together on the floor of the cranial cavity. There is consequently no
                    interorbital septum. The parietals also descend laterally, but unite with the
                    basisphenoid by suture. On the base of the skull we note various processes for
                    the insertion of ventral cervicooccipital muscles, much used during the act of
                    vigorous striking. Boidae have a long sphenoidal ridge and thick basipterygoid
                    processes; others have one or more median knobs or crests, and the Viperidae
                    have a very prominent and large ridge. The parietals fuse together into an
                    unpaired mass whence arises mostly a strong median crest which projects a little
                    beyond the occiput; there is no parietal or pineal foramen. There are paired
                    frontaIs, postfrontals, prefrontaIs and</p>
               <p>nasals; the latter</p>
               <p>are said to coössify</p>
               <p>in <hi rend="italic">Charina</hi> only.</p>
               <p>The position of the</p>
               <p>prefrontals is vari-</p>

               <p>in contact with the</p>
               <p>nasals in the boas,</p>

               <p>but more or Iess</p>
               <p>widcIy separated</p>
               <p>from them, and</p>
               <p>often from each other, in the Colubridae and Viperidae. The premaxillary is
                    single·, and only in Glauconiidae connected with the maxillaries; in the others
                    it is but loosely connected with the ethmoidal end of the skull, for instance,
                    with the turbinals, which are osseous and well developed in pythons.</p>
               <p>The whole appendicular apparatus is most loosely attached to the skull, at least
                    in the typical snakes, and since they do not chew their prey but only hook it
                    in, so to speak, during the act of swallowing, the whole apparatus is as movable
                    as possible.</p>
               <p>The whole palatal apparatus shows many modifications, but the maxillaries,
                    palatines and pterygoids always remain widely asunder, and from the mid-line.
                    Some of the modifications, so far as they are used for taxonomic purposes, are
                    mentioned in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Snakes:</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Classification.</hi> In the majority of snakes the maxillaries
                    form the borders of the mouth, and they are but loosely attached to the other
                    bones, to their palatine processes, to the palatines, and with their posterior
                    ends, by the ectopterygoids to the pterygoids. In the Viperidae the maxillaries
                    are much shortened and articulate extensively with the prefrontals; they can be
                    erected, or rather pushed forwards, by the ectopterygoids (see <hi
                        rend="smallcaps">Snakes)</hi> ; they are not connected with the palatines.
                    The pterygoids diverge posteriorly and articulate loosely with the quadrates; in
                    the original condition the articulation is near the distal end of the quadrate,
                        <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in Boidae, and the pterygoids may form an
                    additional attachment with the mandibles; in the Viperidae the pterygoids are
                    somewhat shortened and are attached to about the middle of the quadrate shafts;
                    in the Amblycepha-lidae they are still shorter and do not reach these bones. The
                    ectopterygoids are lost by the burrowing Typhlopidae and Glau-coniidae. The
                    quadrate is always extremely movable; besides being in a most curious way
                    connected with the outer end of the columellar rod (see below, <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ear),</hi> it is suspended from the skull by the squamosal. The
                    squamoso-quadrate connexion is very loose; that of the squamosal with the skull
                    varies much. In the majority of snakes it slides quite freely upon the parietal;
                    it is much longer than the quadrate in the boas, much shorter than the elongated
                    and slender quadrate in most of the poisonous snakes. Lastly, in most of the
                    ancient burrowing snakes, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Typhlops, Glaucoma, Ilysia</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Uropeltis,</hi> the squamosal has worked its way into the
                    cranial wall so that the quadrate, itseIf also much shortened, rests directly
                    upon the cranium.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">The Vertebral Column.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The vertebrae of all reptiles are gastrocentrous, that is to say, the centra or
                    bodies of the vertebrae are formed by the originally paired, interventral
                    cartilages, while the basiventrals are reduced, persisting either as so-called
                    intercentra or wedge-bones, or as intervertebral pads, or disappearing
                    altogether; the basidorsal elements form the neural arch. At the earlier stages
                    of development the gastrocentrous vertebrae behave in the same way as in the
                    Urodela, except that the interdorsal pair of elements is suppressed from the
                    beginning (the very elements which in</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0153" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0176.jp2"/>
               <p>Stegocephali and most Anura form the centre), therefore the typical batrachian
                    vertebrae are notocentrous. If the remaining three pairs of constituent elements
                    of each vertebra (the neural arch, the centrum and the intercentra) remain
                    separate, the vertebrae are called temnospondylous <hi rend="italic"
                        >(τέμνω,</hi> I cut, σ7τόρδνλο5, a vertebra). If the neural arches and the
                    centra are suturally united, or are fused with each other, the vertebrae are
                    called Stereospondylous <hi rend="italic">(στερεός,</hi> solid). In many fossil
                    reptiles most or many of the vertebrae are temnospondylous; in most of the
                    recent Amniota <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="27">
                        There remained a flaw in the correctness of the view that the bodies of the
                        amniotic vertebrae are formed by the paired interven-tral pieces, since the
                        bodies were known always to appear from the first as unpaired, cartilaginous
                        masses, until G. B. Howes found them to consist of a right and left pair in
                        the embryosof <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon.</hi>
                    </note> they are consolidated, but the atlas or first vertebra remains usually in
                    a relatively primitive condition, and is temnospondylous but for the usual
                    modification that its centrum becomes attached to that of the second vertebra
                    and forms its odontoid process. The composition of gastrocentrous vertebrae is
                    best illustrated by the first and second cervical vertebrae of crocodiles,
                    whence by reduction and fusion the structure of every other vertebra can be
                    explained. We have only to add that the ribs are genetically derived from
                    lateral outgrowths of the basiventral elements, whilst the chevron bones are
                    mere ventral outgrowths from the same basal cartilages. The most primitive
                    vertebral column is that of tbe Geckos. The</p>
               <p>vertebra consists chiefly of a large neural arch which rests broadly upon the
                    centrum; this is a tube, more or less calcified and ossified, with a narrow
                    waist in the middle, widening head- and tail wards. The tube is hollow, the
                    chorda dorsalis passing through the whole column, and there are no proper joints
                    between the centra, which are amphicoelous. Between the centra lies a separate
                    element, the so-called intercentrum, which is ring-shaped and acts as an
                    interarticular pad instead of a joint. The first of these rings forms the
                    ventral half of the atlas ring; the second is attached to the cranial surface of
                    the second centrum, and produces, Eke some of the next following ones, a
                    vertical median blade of bone, a true hypapophysis. Such intercentra exist
                    throughout the length of the vertebral column; in the tail they are enlarged and
                    carry a pair of chevrons, which are cartilaginous and have the tendency of
                    fusing by superficial</p>
               <p>ossification on to the caudal ends of the centrum next in front, to which they
                    do not belong genetically. Exactly in the middle of each vertebra the thin shell
                    of the centrum forms a cartilaginous septum, of what is often wrongly called

                    condition in the tail, the chorda is here rent asunder, otherwise it is only
                    constricted. This septum is but slightly invaded by ossification, and consists
                    of large cells which retain the appearance of young or embryonic cartilage. It
                    coincides exactly with the line of transverse division of most of the caudal
                    vertebrae into</p>
               <p>an anterior and a posterior half,</p>

               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> also has biconcave vertebrae owing to the
                    persistence of the chorda dorsalis in the intervertebral region; otherwise the
                    vertebrae are solid. Intercentra occur from the atlas regularly into the tail,
                    where they carry chevron bones. The atlas-ring (fig. 25, 9) is composed of the
                    first intercentrum and a pair of neural arches which remain quite separate and
                    carry on the dorsal side a pair of ossicles, the disconnected supradorsal
                    elements of the atlas, erroneously supposed to be the remnants of the “
                    proatlas.”</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Crocodiles.—</hi> Remnants of the chorda persist in the middle
                    of the centra, which, in recent species, are mostly procoelous, and with a
                    convex knob behind, but the first caudal is strongly biconvex.' Cartilaginous
                    intercentral rings, pads or menisci, occur throughout the column; in the tail
                    they carry chevrons. For the instructive detail of the composition of the first
                    and second cervical vertebrae see fig. 25, 7 and 8. Some of the posterior neck
                    and anterior thoracic vertebrae have an unpaired hypapophysis arising from the
                    centrum. The vertebrae have the usual processes, viz. spinous process, a pair of
                    anterior and posterior zygapophyses arising from the neural arch, diapophyses
                    likewise from this arch for the articulation with the tubercular portion of the
                    rib; short parapophyses from the centra for the capitular ends of the ribs; the
                    transverse processes of the 12th vertebra, and following, carry the whole rib,
                    and are like the processes of the lumbar vertebrae diapapophyses; the so-called
                    transverse processes of the tail are mainly the anchy-losed or fused ribs
                    themselves.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Chelonians.—</hi> The vertebrae are sometimes in the various
                    regions of the same column opistho-pro-or amphicoelous, or even biconvex.
                    Intercentra occur regularly on the first two or three cervicals, and on the tail
                    as paired or unpaired nodules, or as chevrons, which articulate mostly with the
                    previous centra and occasionally fuse with them. Intercentral,
                    fibrocartilaginous disks occur regularly, mostly in the shape of rings; the
                    first is the transverse ligament of the atlas-ring. In the Trionychidae (fig.
                    25, 10), but also in some other tortoises, the various pieces of the atlas do
                    not anchylose, and the first centrum remains also movably attached to the
                    second, although it sometimes carries,</p>

                    connected that part can be thrown off by the muscular exertion of the creature
                    itself. The reproduced tail is, however, only a sham tail, since neither centra
                    nor arches, but only a non-segmented rod or tube of fibro-cartilage is produced.
                    It is, however, invested with new muscles and with skin, but the scales often
                    differ considerably from thosc of the normal organ, sometimes showing reversion
                    to an ancestral form. For further detail see G. A. BouTenger <hi rend="sub"

               <p>and fuses with, the second intercentral piece. The entire atlas remains in a
                    primitive, typically temnospondylous condition. On the other hand, in some
                    Ileurodira, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Platemys</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chelys,</hi> all the constituent parts of the atlas coössify and form a
                    complete, solid vertebra, which articulates by a concave-convex joint with the
                    true centrum of the second vertebra. The normal number of cervical vertebrae is
                    eight in all Chelonians. The last cervical has sometimes, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
                        Chelydra,</hi> a very peculiar shape with strangely modified articular
                    facets, in correlation with the retractile neck. The neural spines of the trunk
                    vertebrae broaden out and fuse with the neural plates of the carapace. A
                    tertiary modification takes place in many Pleurodira with the reduction of the
                    neurals by the costal plates, which then meet in the dorsal line and cover the
                    neural spinal processes. The caudal vertebrae are often much reduced in size,
                    although not always in numbers, when the tail is very short, as in the marine
                    turtles. In various species of <hi rend="italic">Testudo</hi> about half a dozen
                    of the last caudal vertebrae fuse together into a veritable urostyle, which is
                    covered with a claw- or nail-shaped sheath of horn. In some of the gigantic
                    tortoises of Mauritius this caudal vertebral complex is fully 3 in. long and 2
                    in. broad, of an extraordinary appearance.</p>
               <p>The vertebrae of the <hi rend="italic">Lacerlae,</hi> or Lizards proper, are a
                    direct further development of those of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon.</hi> The
                    chorda disappears; the vertebrae are procoelous, with an articulating knob
                    behind. Intercentrals, in the shape of osseous, unpaired nodules or wedges,
                    persist on most of the cervical vertebrae; they are absent in the trunk and
                    reappear in the tail, either as wedges or with chevrons. The first intercentral
                    forms the central half of the atlas, with the neural half of which it is
                    connected by süture. The second fuses mostly with the cranial end of the second
                    centre and with the caudal and ventral surface of the odontoid, forming a
                    downward-directed hook. Frequently the fusion remains incomplete, or the wedges
                    may completely merge into the epistropheal mass without leaving any outward
                    traces. Boulenger has made the important observation that the intercentra of the
                    tail are sometimes paired, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Heloderrna.</hi> When the caudal vertebrae are strongly procoelous, the
                    knob is very long and the chevrons are attached to its neck, having shifted on
                    to the vertebra in front, while their basal intercentral piece, or pieces,
                    remain in the original position. In <hi rend="italic">Ophisaurus</hi> the
                    chevrons are absolutely fused with the caudal ends of the centra and thus assume
                    a superficial resemblance to the vertebrae of Urodela. The splitting of the
                    tail-vertebrae and regeneration have been described on a previous page. The
                    trunk-vertebrae of the Tejidae and the larger Iguanidae possess additional
                    articulating processes and facets, besides the usual processes. The <hi
                        rend="italic">Zygosphene</hi> is a wedge-shaped process with two articular
                    facets, which projects forward from the anterior side of each neural arch. The
                        <hi rend="italic">Zygantrum</hi> forms a corresponding excavation with a
                    pair of articular surfaces on the hinder side of the arch. The crests on the
                    tail and trunk of many lizards, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Iguanidae, are
                    entirely tegumentary structures and not supported by the axial skeleton, except
                    in some chameleons, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Ch. cristatus,</hi> and in the
                    peculiar genus <hi rend="italic">Brookesia*,</hi> in these the accessory
                    much-complicated processes are enormously elongated and support the high

               <p>The, vertebrae of the snakes are procoelous (figs. 27, 28, 29). Besides the
                    zygapophyses, they have Zygosphenes on the neural arches; the ribs articulate
                    with the parapophyses. Long, unpaired hypapophyses arise from the centre of the
                    anterior neck and trunk vertebrae to a variable extent. In <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dasypeltis</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Rhachiodon</hi> a considerable number
                    of these processes perforate the oesophagus and act as crushers of the shell of
                    the eggs which these snakes swallow. The often-repeated statement that these
                    processes are capped with enamel is erroneous. The caudal vertebrae are devoid
                    of chevron bones, but they carry paired hypapophyses, and they have transverse
                    processes which also are generally bent downwards.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the numbers of vertebrae composing the whole column and its various
                    regions. In the snakes we can distinguish only between atlas and epistropheus,
                    trunk and tail. The numbers vary exceedingly, in the trunk up to several
                    hundred.</p>
               <p>The tail may contain only a few, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in the burrowing

               </p>
               <p>There is no obvious reciprocal correlation between the length of the trunk and
                    the tail. In the other orders of reptiles the neck is well marked, except in the
                    snake-shaped lizards. If we define as first thoracic vertebra that which is the

               <p>The <hi rend="italic">ribs,</hi> having arisen as lateral, separated off
                    processes from the basiventral elements, show many modifications in their
                    proximal attachments. These can be best studied on the skeleton of a young
                    crocodile (fig. 25, 7 and 8). The first pair of ribs is very long and broad,
                    attached to the unpaired ventral piece of the atlas-ring; the tubercular portion
                    is indicated by a very small rugosity. The second pair of ribs is still larger;
                    the capitulum attached to the second intercentral piece which fuses with the
                    odontoid process; the tubercular process is weak or represented only by a
                    ligamentous connexion with a small knob of the odontoid process; consequently
                    the tuberculum has shifted its attachment away from the second vertebra. The
                    other cervical, and the anterior thoracic, ribs have complete</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0155" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0178.jp2"/>
               <p>capitular and tubercular processes, which, articulating with the bodies and with
                    dorsolateral processes of the neural arches of their vertebrae, enclose typical
                    transverse canals. In the posterior thoracic region <hi rend="sub">L</hi> tbe
                    ribs are attached entirely to transverse processes of the neural arches, both
                    capitular and tubercular portions having left the bodies or centra; the same
                    arrangement prevails in the tail, but the ribs are very short and soon fuse with
                    the processes. The two sacral ribs are very thick, articulating with the centra
                    and the bases of their neural arch, and they even form part of the
                    intervertebral Joint ! In <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> the first three ribs
                    are represented by bands of connective tissue only, with similar attachments as
                    in crocodiles.</p>
               <p>The other cervical ribs are osseous; their short capitula retain their partly
                    intercentral attachment, while the tubercula are carried by low processes of the
                    centra. In the thorax both capitulum and tuberculum merge into one facet, which
                    is gradually shifting farther tailwards and upwards until the attachment reaches
                    them, and then lies upon the neuro-central suture. The first caudal vertebrae
                    also possess ribs, very short and soon fusing with the diapophyses of the neural
                    arches. In the cervical region of the <hi rend="italic">Chelonia</hi> the ribs
                    seem to be absent. In the thorax they retain their primitive intercentral
                    position throughout life, assuming (except the first pair, which remains short
                    and least modified) an absolutely intervertebral position. From the lumbar or
                    presacral region backwards the capitula are gradually shifting upon short
                    processes of the centra, until in the tail the vestigial ribs are carried by the
                    diapophyses of the neural arches. In <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi> (fig. 31)
                    all the ribs are free; in the other Chelonians the ribs, generally in the recent
                    species, flatten and become surrounded by the growing membrane bone of the
                    dorsal plates, and the cartilage of the ribs (except the capitular and neck
                    portion of the rib, which cannot be got at by the dermal bones) undergoes a
                    process of calcification.</p>
               <p>Ultimately this is resorbed and its place is taken by the dermal bone, which
                    forms, so to speak, a cast of the rib. Several of the short presacral ribs, and
                    of course the post sacrais, are not drawn into these enormous changes, although
                    the carapace covers, and indirectly affects, them.</p>
               <p>Certain changes initiated in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> are more marked in
                    the ribs of the Lacertilia; cervical ribs are often long in the lower neck. In
                    the trunk the capitular portions are often much reduced, and in these cases the
                    ribs are suspended mainly by their tubercular portions, usually from the
                    diapophyses of the neural arches near the anterior end.</p>
               <p>In the snakes all the vertebrae, from the second cervical to the tail, carry
                    ribs. These are very movable, articulating with a rather large, more or less
                    vertically placed facet, which is borne by the parapophysis or transverse
                    process; sometimes the rib retains traces of the original division into a
                    capitular and tubercular portion. The ribs of tbe snakes, although long, consist
                    only of their dorsal portions. In snake-shaped lizards, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
                        Pseudopus,</hi> rather long ribs begin with the fourth vertebra.</p>
               <p>Uncinate processes are developed only in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and in
                    the Crocodilia. They are not homologous structures, arising in tbe former from,
                    the posterior margin of the middle of the dorsal portions of the ribs,
                    overlapping the shaft of the next following rib; in the crocodiles they arise

                        >Sphenodon</hi> and Crocodiles the thoracic ribs consist of three successive

                        trunk.</hi> —The sternum of most reptiles consists (1) of an anterior
                    portion (presternum, Parker; prostemum, Fürbringer; mesostemum of Gegenbaur),
                    which is generally broad, more or less rhomboid and carries the shoulder-girdle,
                    and on its posterior sides severaI pairs of ribs; (2) of a posterior portion
                    (mesostemum and xiphi-Sternum of Parker; Xiphisternum of Fürbringer; metastemum
                    of Gegenbaur), which is narrow, sometimes metameric, carries several pairs of
                    ribs, and generally divides into a right and left XiphoidaI half, each of which
                    is continued into one or more ribs. These ribs tend to lose their connexion, and
                    in these cases the sternum ends in two typical xiphoid processes. The
                    distinction between pre- and metasternum is arbitrary. In <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphenodon</hi> the broad sternal plate carries only three pairs of ribs,
                    the 8th to 10th, and there is no Xiphisternum. The other ribs of the trunk are
                    long and compound, but they remain free and do not approach the mid-line. From
                    the posterior edge of the sternum to the pelvis extends the complicated <hi
                        rend="italic">parasternum,</hi> embedded in the abdominal wall; it is
                    composed of about two dozen sets of abdominal ribs, each set containing a right
                    and a left and a median chevron-shaped piece. In the Crocodilia the presternum
                    carries only two or one pair of ribs, always that of the 10th vertebra. The
                    narrow", more or less metameric metastemum carries seven or eight ribs, the last
                    one to three being xiphoidal. The post-thoracic ribs gradually decrease in
                    length; about three presacral vertebrae have no ribs, and so are typically
                    lumbar. The sacral ribs are generally the 25th and 26th in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Crocodilus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Alligator*,</hi> sometimes the 24th
                    and 25th in <hi rend="italic">Gavialis.</hi> The parasternum consists of only
                    seven or eight transverse sets, each composed of two right and tw <hi rend="sup"
                        >r</hi> o left narrow splint-bones. AU these parasternal elements belong to
                    the category of dermal bones, together with those of the plastron of tortoises,
                    inherited from Stegocephalian conditions.</p>
               <p>The Lacertilia present an almost endless variety. The presternum is rhomboid and
                    broad; it carries from three to six pairs of ribs, mostly four or five; the
                    first thoracic rib is that of the 9th vertebra, the only exceptions being tbe
                    chameleons with only five cervical vertebrae, and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Varanus,</hi> which has usually nine cervicals like the crocodiles. The
                    last cervical rib in these long-necked lizards is very long and has all the
                    appearance of having but recently severed its connexion with the sternum. The
                    presternum of Lacertilia sometimes has a window, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>
                    some species of <hi rend="italic">Lacerla, Phrynosoma, Iguana,</hi> or a pair of
                    windows, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Agama, Liolepis, Goniocephalus.</hi> The
                    xiphi-sternum carries a variable number of ribs; it is either scarcely
                    distinguished from the anterior plate, or it is long, and in these cases either
                    double, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Iguana, Gerrhonotus, Varanus, Zonurus, Agama,
                        Cyclodus, Lacerta',</hi> or single, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Zonosanrus.</hi>
                    the post-sternal ribs shorten gradually in the majority of the Lacertae, and
                    there is sometimes a ribless lumbar vertebra, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in <hi
                        rend="italic">Iguana,</hi> in many Lacertilia, however, the ventral

                    either by Ugaments, or they join together, forming complete hoops of thin
                    cartilages. Such ribs occur in all Geckones and Chameleons, but also in many
                    Iguanidae, Scinddae, and evenrin the Anelytropidae; their numbers vary much,

                    parasternal ribs.</p>
               <p>In the lizards with much reduced fore limbs, the sternum loses its connexion
                    with the ribs from behind forwards; two sternal ribs existing in the Tejid <hi
                        rend="italic">Ophiodes</hi> and in the Scincoid <hi rend="italic"

                    embryo). The sternum is likewise quite free in <hi rend="italic">Chirotes</hi>
                    in spite of its functional limbs; the sternum is still a large plate, with</p>
               <p>a window, and ending in two long, xiphoid processes.</p>
               <p>Lastly, the sternum has vanished without a trace, as in the snakes, in some
                    species of <hi rend="italic">Acontias,</hi> in the Anelytropidae, <hi
                        rend="italic">Dibamus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Aniella</hi> (Fürbringer).
                    In the limbless genera of Amphisbaenidae the sternum is very much reduced; in
                        <hi rend="italic">Trogonophis</hi> alone it is still represented by a narrow
                    transverse bar connecting the ossicular vestiges of the shoulder-girdle; in the
                    other genera the sternum has shrunk to a pair of nodules or to a single nodule.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">pectoral</hi> or <hi rend="italic">shoulder-girdle</hi> in
                    its completest condition consists of a right and left scapula, coracoid,
                    precoracoid and clavicles, and an unpaired interclavicle or episternum. The
                    dorsal portion of the scapula remains cartilaginous, with or without
                    calcification, and is usually distinguished as supra-scapula. The ventral
                    portion of the precoracoidal and cora-coidal mass remains likewise more or less
                    cartilaginous, rather unnecessarily distinguished as epicoracoid. Ossification
                    begins near the glenoid cavity and thence spreads, eventually with the formation
                    of a dorsal and a ventral centre. The resulting suture separates the dorsal or
                    scapular from the ventral or coraco-precoracoidal mass. A kind of landmark, not
                    always reliable, between coracoid and precoracoid is the exit of the
                    supra-coracoidal nerve. The ventral margins of the coracoids articulate in tenon
                    and mortice fashion with the antero-lateral margins of the sternum. The
                    interclavicle, usually T-shaped, is a dermal bone and rests upon the ventral
                    side of the girdle. The paired clavicles, sometimes fused together, rest upon
                    the anterior end of the inter clavicle and extend transversely to the acromial
                    process of the scapula; the detail of the attachments varies much.</p>
               <p>The girdle is most complete in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and in
                    Lacertilia. In <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> the coracoid forms one
                    continuous mass with the precoracoid, without further differentiation; the
                    clavicles are fused with the interclavicle into one T-shaped mass, the
                    cross-arms of which are attached to the acromia by ligaments. In the lizards
                    (except <hi rend="italic">Heloderma)</hi> the much-broadened central and
                    anterior halves of the girdle are fenestrated; the windows, always closed by
                    membranes, are bordered by bony processes, distally by unossified cartilage. The
                    first window to appear, or the most constant, lies between the coracoid and its
                    precoracoid; in <hi rend="italic">Anguis</hi> it is the only window, in this
                    case not a primary feature. In other lizards, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
                        Uromastix,</hi> a second window occurs between precoracoid and scapula, and
                    even a third window can appear in the scapula itself, causing in many Iguanidae,
                        <hi rend="italic">e.g. Amblyrhynchus</hi> (see fig. 33, <hi rend="italic"
                        >ms.),</hi> the so-called mesoscapula; an analogous window within the
                    coracoid produces the mesocoracoid; unnecessary distinctions of little
                    morphological value considering the great variability of these fenestrations in
                    closely allied genera.</p>
               <p>The chameleons have lost the clavicles and the interclavicle, and the scapula,
                    which is very slender and long, is devoid of an acromial process. The coracoid
                    forms one mass with the precoracoid, through the middle of which /passes the
                    supra-coracoidal nerve; the coracoids articulate by their whole bases with the
                    sternum.</p>
               <p>Geckos possess a complete shoulder-girdle; the ventral portion shows, <hi
                        rend="italic">e.g. Hemidactylus,</hi> three pairs of windows; only one in
                        <hi rend="italic">Uroplatcs.</hi> In the latter the interclavicle is much
                    reduced; the clavicles meet each other and are slender rods. In the Geckoninae
                    and Eublepharinae the ventral halves of the clavicles are dilated and possess
                    each a foramen; the interclavicle is cross-shaped.</p>
               <p>In the more or less limbless genera of lizards the shoulder-girdle is much
                    reduced. In <hi rend="italic">Chirotcs,</hi> which still has functional fore
                    limbs, the clavicles and the interclavicle are absent, the coracoids are not
                    divided from the precoracoids; in the limbless Amphisbaenidae the girdle is
                    reduced to a pair of cylindrical ossicles in <hi rend="italic">Amphisbaena,
                        Blanus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Trogonophis',</hi> no vestiges exist in

                        >Anops.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Foramina in the broadened clavicles occur also in various Lacertae, for instance
                    in the Iguanid <hi rend="italic">Laemanctus,</hi> in the Scin-coid <hi
                        rend="italic">Trachysaurus,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Plestiodon,
                        Zonosaurus</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Lacerta simonyi,</hi> but not in
                        <hi rend="italic">L. agilis.</hi> In <hi rend="italic">Mabnia</hi> the
                    median portions are especially broad and show each two foramina. Their presence
                    can be of but very doubtful taxonomic value.</p>
               <p>The girdle of the Crocodiles is considerably simplified. Scapula and coracoidae,
                    movably united, at least in younger specimens. The precoracoid is slightly
                    indicated by a process of the coracoid, which is perforated by the
                    supra-coracoidal nerve near the glenoid cavity. Clavicles are absent. The
                    interclavicle is reduced to a long, fiat splint-bone, which is firmly fused on
                    to the sternal cartilage. The Chelonian shoulder-girdle shows several very
                    remarkable modifications. Instead of lying outside the trunk, it has been
                    transferred into the cavity of the trunk, the carapace with the ribs covering it
                    from the outside. An explanation of the changes implied in this transposition is
                    still extant. Chelomans are, moreover, the only reptiles besides Pterosauria in
                    which the scapula is attached to the skeleton of the trunk. The scapulae stand
                    in a more or less vertical position, and their dorsal end rests against the
                    inside of the nuchal plate, where this is sutured to the first neural and the
                    first costal plate, a little in front of and sidewards from the first short rib.
                    From near its ventral end the scapula sends oit a long process, which converges
                    transversely with its fellow. This process, the clavicle(J) or the precoracoid
                    of many authors, is the acromial process, the Plesiosauri giving the clue as to
                    how an acromion can assume such an abnormal position. The coracoid, with a
                    suture between it and the scapula, is very long and extends horizontally
                    backwards, not meeting that of the other side. The sternum being</p>

               <p>absent, and clavicles and interclavicles forming the epi-and endo-plastral
                    elements of the plastron, the shoulder-girdle is nowhere in contact with the
                    skeleton except at its dorsal end.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">The Fore Limbs.—</hi> The humerus has near its upper end a
                    median process, and at a variable distance a lateral process, near which is the
                    biceps-fossa. Above the radial or outer condyle exists a foramen for the passage
                    of the radial nerve in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> in the Lacertilia,

                    the crocodiles neither.</p>
               <p>Ulna and radius always remain distinct; the former is generally the stouter
                    although not always the larger bone. The carpus may contain as many as 12
                    separate elements: ulnare, intermedium, radiale, 2 centraba, a pisiform on the
                    ulnar and a small nodule in a corresponding · position on the medial side, and 5
                    distal carpals. In <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> the centralia are sometimes
                    fused into one, and the radial nodule is absent ; the numbers of phalanges are,
                    2, 3, 4, 4 and 3 proceeding from the first to the fifth finger. The carpus of
                    the Chelonia is likewise primitive, with various unimportant reductions; <hi
                        rend="italic">Chelydra</hi> possesses one or two centralia, whilst pisiform
                    and extra radial are absent; both these bones are present in <hi rend="italic"

                    the pisiform is small; intermedium, centrale and radiale are represented by one

                    two remaining are free. In the marine turtles the fore limbs are transformed
                    into paddles; the ulna is considerably shorter than the radius; all the normaI
                    nine carpal elements remain distinct; the pisiform is much enlarged, helping to
                    increase the paddling surface, and it has moved from the ulnar carpal to the
                    side of the fifth distal carpal. The three middle fingers and toes have mostly 3
                    phalanges; the pollex and hallux have always 2 ; the number of phalanges of the
                    fifth finger varies from 3 to 1, of the fifth toe from 2 to 0. The greatest

               <p>Considerable advance is marked by the Crocodiles. The intermedium and centrale
                    are lost, the pisiform is small, ulnar and radiale are considerably elongated
                    and enlarged. Of the distal carpals the two last are fused into one bone, and
                    the three first, together with the central, are transformed into a pad-like
                    cartilaginous and ligamentous piece between the large radial and the first and
                    second finger, to which the pad is firmly attached. The other fingers articulate
                    with the “ huma turn.” The result of the whole arrangement is the formation of
                    two main joints, one between fore arm and carpus, the other inter-carpal. The
                    number of phalanges is 2, 3, 4, 4, 3.</p>

                    carpalia are present, also the pisiform; the first distal carpal is much reduced
                    and the correspondingly enlarged radial carpal comes into articulating contact
                    with the first metacarpal. The numbers of phalanges are 2, 3, 4, 4, and 2 or <hi

                    modified; the first three fingers form an inner bundle opposed to the outer or
                    fourth and fifth fingers; in correlation herewith the third and fourth distaI
                    carpals are fused into one rather Iargê mass; the other elements remain free,
                    and A. Stecker has found a smalI intermedium present in the young, in a position
                    which indicates that its subsequent absence is due to loss, not fusion with
                    neighbouring elements.</p>

                    at their ventral ends, except the so-called pubes of the crocodiles, and these
                    two symphyses are further continuous with each other, dividing the
                    pubo-ischiadic space into a right and left foramen obturatum of very variable
                    size. They are small and round in <hi rend="italic">Testudo,</hi> divided by a

                        rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and in the Lacertilia. Frequently the
                    symphysial portion at the anterior end of the pubic symphysis remains
                    cartilaginous, unpaired, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in most Chelonians and
                    Lacertilians, comparable with the epipubis of Urodela. A corresponding
                    cartilage, the os cloacae or hypoischium, is continued backwards, from the
                    ischiadic symphysis towards the vent, serving for the attachment of sphincter
                    muscles; it occurs in many lizards and tortoises. In the Chelonians the pubic
                    bones are generally much stronger than the ischia, and they send out each a
                    strong lateral pubic process, directed forwards and outwards; the obturator
                    nerve passes through the wide obturator foramen. In the pleuro-dirous tortoises
                    the ends of the ilia and those of the lateral processes of the pubes are much
                    broadened and firmly anchy-losed with the posterior costal plates and with the
                    Xiphiplastron respectively. The whole pelvis, like the shoulder-girdle, Iies
                    inside the body. The pelvis of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> is essentially
                    like that of the Lacertilia. The pubes are slender ; they send out a pair of
                    lateral processes, near the base of which the obturator nerve pierces the shaft
                    of its pubis. This lateral process is the homologue of the long, slender pubis
                    of birds. The chameleons’ pelvis is peculiar. Ibe pubes are devoid of lateral
                    processes, but from their anterior end arises a pair of small cartilages, in a
                    transverse direction; their ends are connected by ligament with the median
                    anterior portion of the ischiadic symphysis. The crocodilian pelvis is very
                    aberrant. The ilium is broad and sends two processes to the acetabulum, which
                    retains a foramen;* the posterior process articulates movably with the ischium;
                    the preacetabular process fuses in very young specimens with a separate,
                    ossifying, cartilaginous piece, which then forms a rough joint with the anterior
                    portion or process of the ischium, which closes the acetabulum on its ventral
                    side. To this anterior ischiadic process is attached the freely-movable,
                    club-shaped bone, generally called pubis. The homologies of these cIub-shaped
                    bones and of the small bone mentioned above are not clear. The club-shaped bones
                    remain asunder; the ischia form a long and firm symphysis. The obturator nerve
                    passes out of the pelvis between the ischium and the cIub-shaped bone, close to
                    the posterior margin of the latter.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">posterior limbs</hi> show <hi rend="sup">7</hi>
                    essentially the same composition as the fore limbs, but the modifications in the
                    various reptilian orders are much greater. The femur has generally a well-marked
                    neck. Fibula and tibia remain distinct; the former usually shows a reduction in
                    thickness. In the tarsus we observe never more than two proximal tarsal
                    elements, a reduction due either to the suppression of the intermedium or to its
                    enlargement and concomitant loss of the tibial element. The least-modified
                    foot-skeleton is that of the Chelydridae, the lowest Chelonians. The proximal
                    row is composed of a fibulare, and a much larger piece articulates with both
                    tibia and fibula, the “ astragalus” ; the centrale is present; the first threo
                    distal tarsaIs remain separate, each carrying a toe. The fused fourth and fifth
                    tarsals carry the fourth toe, and, laterally attached, the hook-shaped fifth
                    metatarsal. <hi rend="italic">Chelone</hi> shows the same arrangement, except
                    that the centrale is fused with the astragalus; in <hi rend="italic">Tesludo,
                        Ernys,</hi> the fibulare, astragalus and centrale are fused into one broad
                    mass, with the result of forming a cruro-tarsal and an intertarsal joint. The
                    same arrangement reached by the Testudinidae is universal in the Lacertae, with
                    the further modification that the three first distal tarsaIs fuse on to the
                    proximal ends of their respective metatarsals. Most aberrant is the tarsus of
                    ChameIeons, in which the first and second toe</p>

               <p>form a bundle opposed to the rest; the fibulare and tibiale are fused into one
                    bone; the fused fifth and fourth distal tarsals form a very large half-globular
                    piece for the three outer toes, whilst the second toe is carried by the third
                    distal tarsal, besides which there are three more small cartilages, one of which
                    may be the displaced second tarsal or the still independent central. The tarsus
                    of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> is like that of typical lizards, but none of
                    its distal tarsals are fused on to metatarsals. The Crocodilian foot marks an
                    advance. The astragalus is large, articulating well with tibia and fibula, and
                    against the fibulare, which forms a typical, heel-shaped calcanéum. The fifth
                    and fourth distal tarsals carry the fourth toe and the hook-shaped fifth
                    metatarsal to which the fifth toe is reduced. The third, second and first distaI
                    tarsalia scarcely contain osseous nodules; they form together a wedge-shaped
                    cartilaginous pad between the astragalus and the first and second toes. This
                    attachment of the distal tarsals to the metatarsals reminds us of the
                    Lacertilian condition, the result in either case being a still more marked
                    intertarsal joint in addition to the cruro-tarsal.</p>
               <p>Most well-footed reptiles retain all the five toes; only the crocodiles and a
                    few tortoises have lost all the phalanges of the fifth toe. The phalangeal
                    numbers are in the Lacertilia 2, 3, 4, 5 and 3 in the fifth toe; in chameleons
                    2, 3, 4, 4, 3; in most tortoises 2, 3, 3, 3, 2; but in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Homopus, Pyxis QjadCinixys</hi> 2, 2, 2, 2, 0; in the crocodiles 2, 3, 4,
                    4, 0. The embryos of crocodiles are said to be IiyperphaIangeaI ; <hi
                        rend="italic">i.e.</hi> as many as 7 phalanges on the fourth; 5 or 6 on the
                    fifth finger; 6 on the fourth toe, and there are traces of the fifth toe. In the
                    adult the fourth toe remains without a claw. Burrowing and living in sand, or
                    humus, is in many lizards correlated with reduction of the limbs and their
                    girdles. The vestiges of the hind limbs come to lie as near the vent as
                    possible. The reduction occurs in various families, independently. In most cases
                    the fore limbs disappear first, but in the Amphisbaenidae, cf. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chirotes,</hi> and in the Tejidae, the reverse takes place. Whilst
                    degeneracy of the shoulder-girdle is delayed long after the loss of the anterior
                    limbs, that of the pelvic arch precedes the loss of the hind limbs. Cope has
                    drawn up a tabular statistic of the loss of digits, limbs and their girdles on
                    pp. 202-3 of his work, <hi rend="italic">Crocodiles, Lizards and Snakes of North

               </p>
               <p>The skin of reptiles is characterized by the strong development of its horny
                    stratum; on the outside of it exists a thin cuticular or epitrichial layer. An
                    important feature in most lizards and in the snakes is the existence of a “
                    Subepirdemoidal ” or transitional layer which is produced by the migration of
                    ectodermal cells into the cutis. The immigration takes place during th*e
                    embryonic development, observed first by Kerschner, who, however, misinterpreted
                    the process. Pigment cells, black chromatophores also, make their first
                    appearance in the epiderm and then migrate into the transitional stratum, as has
                    been first correctly stated by F. Maurer. The horny stratum is shed
                    periodically, several times during the year, and as one entire piece in snakes
                    and a few lizards, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Anguidae; in most lizards,
                    chameleons, geckos and in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> the thin, transparent
                    colourless layer comes off in flakes. In crocodiles it is not shed except for
                    the usual wear and tear, nor in tortoises, although in some <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g. Chrysemys/</hi> a periodical peeling of the large shields-has been
                    observed.</p>
               <p>In all reptiles the cutis is raised into papillae, or folds. When the papillae
                    are small the skin appears granular; when they are large, flat, mostly
                    imbricating, they form scales; when they are very broad-based and still larger,
                    they are called scutes or shields. The overlying epidermal covering partakes of
                    these elevations, often <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in many snakes, with a very
                    fine system of ridges of its own. Such a scale, cutis and horny sheath, may form
                    spikes, or crests. They all have only basal growth. Thus, for instance, a shield
                    of a tortoise-shell is a much flattened scale, or cone, with the apex more or
                    less in the centre, surrounded by marginal ridges which indicate the continuous
                    additional growth at the base. The central “ areola ” represents in fact the
                    size of the shield at the time of hatching.</p>
               <p>Of very common occurrence is the development of bone in the cutaneous portion of
                    the scales; such osteoderms occur in many lizards, very strongly developed in
                    the scutes of the crocodiles, especially on the back; they also occur in the
                    skin of tortoises especially on their legs and on the tail, and they probably
                    constitute the peculiar shell of <hi rend="italic">Sphargis,</hi> the leathery
                    turtle (see Tortoise). <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and chameleons are
                    devoid of such osteoderms, in geckos they are likewise absent, but
                    calcifications occur in their tubercular skin. A similar process seems to have
                    produced the egg-tooth of crocodiles and tortoises (see under <hi rend="italic"
                        >Teeth</hi> below). Calcareous deposits, or at least deposits of guanine and
                    more commonly of carbonate of lime, play a considerable rôle in the skin of
                    lizards and snakes. These waste products of the metabolism are always deposited
                    within cells, and a favourite place is the subepidermal layer. In combination
                    with superimposed yellow or red pigment, and with the black chromatophores as a
                    foil, partial or complete screen to the light, as the case may be, these mineral
                    deposists are to a great extent answerable for the colours and their often
                    marvellous changes in the skin (see Chameleon).</p>
               <p>Peculiar pits in the scales of snakes and crocodiles are described under <hi
                        rend="italic">Sense-Organs</hi> below.</p>
               <p>The skin of reptiles is very poor in glands, but the few which exist are well
                    developed. Crocodiles possess a pair of glandular musk bags which open by rather
                    large slits on the under jaw, against the inner side of the jaw. Another pair of
                    musk glands are the anal glands. During great excitement all these glands can be
                    everted by the crocodiles. <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and snakes have only
                    the anal pair. Water tortoises have inguinal glands, which secrete a strongly
                    scented fluid, opening near the posterior rim of the bridge. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Trionyx</hi> has additional glands opening near the anterior part of the
                    plastron. Peculiar glandular structures are the femoral pores of many lizards.
                    They lie in a line from the inner side of the knee to the anterior margin of the
                    anaI region, to which they are restricted in the limbless Amphis-baenidae. Each
                    pore leads into a subcutaneous pocket, sometimes with slightly acinous side
                    chambers, the walls of which produce a smeary, yellowish matter consisting
                    chiefly of the <hi rend="italic">debris</hi> of disintegrated cells which dries
                    or hardens on the surface in the shape of a little projecting rod. They occur in
                    both sexes, but are most active in males during the pairing season. Their use is
                    unknown. It would be far-fetched to liken them to forerunners of the sebaceous
                    portions of milk glands, although not so imaginary as to see in them and in the
                    sensory pits of snake scales the forerunners of the mammalian hairs!</p>
               <p>Claws, scarcely indicated in Batrachia, are fully developed in all limbed
                    reptiles. The base is sunk into the skin like our own finger nails; the dorsal
                    and ventral halves are differentiated into a harder, more curved dorsal

               </p>
               <p>The hemispheres are still much longer than broad, and pass, especially in
                    lizards, graddally into the olfactory lobes, into which continue the ventricles
                    of the hemispheres. The dorsaI walls of these are thin, especially in
                    crocodiles, although they possess already a considerable amount of grey matter.
                    The hasal masses of the fore-brain bulge into the roomy ventricles like
                    cushions. Fibres referable to a corpus callosum are scarcely separated from
                    those of the still much stronger anterior commissure. The epiphysis comes to the
                    surface between the hinder parts of the hemispheres. The pineaI eye is described
                    below under <hi rend="italic">Sense Organs.</hi> The hypophysis has hyjt a
                    shallow infundihulum. The mid-brain shows a pair of dorsal globular swellings,
                    each with a cavity; they separate the hemispheres from the cerebellum. Of the
                    hindbrain, the middle portion is by far the largest; although the dorsal wall of
                    this cerebellum is thick, and rich in grey matter, ift surface is still quite
                    smooth and it shows no trace of an arbor vitae. It covers but a small portion of
                    the wide fourth ventricle.</p>
               <p>The spinal cord shows a brachial and a lumbar longitudinal swelling, especially
                    marked in tortoises, but without a rhom-hoidaI sinus. The cord is continued into
                    the end of the tail.</p>
               <p>The cranial nerves of the reptiles agree in their arrangement and distribution
                    more with those of birds and mammals than with those of the Batrachia. The
                    facial nerve sends a palatine branch to the palate and to the superior maxillary
                    of the trigeminus, and a strong mandibular branch joins the third of the
                    trigeminal, and further ramifications supply the sphincter muscle of the neck.
                    The vagus and glossopharyngeus leave the cranium separately. The vagus then goes
                    towards the heart, which in the Sauropsida is far removed from the head, and
                    there possesses another ganglion, variously called ganglion trunci vagi or g.
                    nodosum. It is connected hy a nerve with the large ganglion supremum of the
                    sympathetic. From the cardiac ganglion, and from the continuation of the vagus,
                    are sent off several branches in succession, which, having to pass below or
                    tailwards from the transverse carotic, aortic and Botal-lian vessels, have to
                    take again a headward course to the larynx and pharynx; a side branch enters the
                    heart by its truncus. The main mass of the vagus then supplies lungs, stomach
                    and further viscera. The accessory or nth cranial nerve arises with about haIf a
                    dozen roots which extend often beyond the second cranial nerve; they collect
                    into a thin stem which leaves the cranium together with the vagus, with which it
                    is often fused; it supplies the cucullaris s. trarepius muscle.</p>
               <p>The hypoglossus arises hy two ventral roots, leaving the skull by two holes
                    through the lateral occipital bone, near the condyle. The united stem is
                    invariably joined by strong branches from cervical nerves, always from the
                    first, mostly also from the second, sometimes also from the third. The details
                    vary much; occasionally there are three craniaI roots and foramina, and then
                    only the first cervical joins the hypo-gIossus; this often fuses with the
                    glossopharyngeal or with the vagus. In the broad and well-muscularized tongue of
                    the crocodiles the right and left hypoglossal branches form a complete ansa, an
                    arrangement in which A. Schneider saw the Infraocsophageal nerve ring of
                    Invertebratal</p>
               <p>The spinal nerves each issue behind, or through, the neural arch of the vertebra
                    to which they belong genetically. The first spinal, or suboccipital, nerve has
                    no dorsal roots, and, having lost its vertebra, an apparently anomalous
                    arrangement has come to pass, in this way, that there arc x cervical vertebrae,
                    but x + i cervical nerves, a condition prevailing in, and characteristic of, all
                    Amniota. The hypoglossal-cervical plexus is separated from the brachial plexus
                    by severaI metameres, according to the Iength of the neck. The brachiaI plexus
                    is composed of ahout 5 nerves; the variations have been studied chiefly by M.
                    Flirhringer. It is interesting to note that the brachiaI pIexus still persists
                    in snakes, although they have CompIetely lost the anterior girdle and the limbs
                    (Albertina Carlsson). A disturbance in the pelvic region likewise indicates in
                    snakes the former existence of a pelvic or Iumbo-sacraI plexus, which in limbed
                    reptiles is composed of about 5 nerves, the last of which is weak and in many
                    cases (hy no means the rule) issues hetween the two sacral vertebrae, sending
                    one branch to the ischiadic, another to the public plexus which supplies the
                    cloacal region. (For details of these pIexuses see the papers by Mivart, Jhering
                    and Gadow.)</p>
               <p>The sympathetic system shows considerable modifications in the various orders
                    and even families of the reptiles. In the neck region, in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphenodon</hi> and most lizards it is*, on the right and left side,
                    composed of two portions. One, more IateraI and placed deeply, runs along the
                    side of the vertebraI column, starting from the first and second spinal nerves,
                    with which it is connected by. so-called rami communicantes; it is not connected
                    with the other spinal nerves until it reaches, in the thorax, the first stem of
                    the brachial plexus, and hereabout lies the so-called second thoracic ganglion.
                    The other, superficial and more ventral, portion arises from the petrosal
                    ganglion of the glossopharyngeal, and from the vagus ganglion, and then forms a
                    long loop which joins the second thoracic ganglion. In its long course it
                    sometimes, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Varanus,</hi> forms
                    one common stem with the vagus before it splits off. At a variable distance, but
                    not far above the heart, the vagus possesses a big swelling, the ganglion trunci
                    vagi, and the sympathetic stem, in the same level, or farther down, has likewise
                    a large ganglion, the g. supremum vagi, or first thoracic ganglion. The vagus
                    ganglion receives several nerve strands from this big sympathetic ganglion, and
                    then divides as described above.</p>
               <p>In the crocodiles the deep portion of the sympathetic hegins at the vagus and
                    extends in rope-ladder fashion into the thorax, there heing, as in hirds,
                    regular transverse communicating hranches with the spinal nerves, and the
                    longitudinal strands run through the transverse foramina between the capitular
                    and tuhercular portions of the cervical ribs. The other, ventral, portion starts
                    by a right and a left branch from the vagus ganglia, hut hoth hranches unite at
                    once into one unpaired stem, which is deepIy embedded in the middle line between
                    the ventral muscles of the cervical vertebrae. Very thin branches connect this
                    unpaired stem with the right and Ieftsympatheticportions; small ganglia are
                    embedded in the unpaired nerve.</p>
               <p>The so-called second thoracic ganglion is in reality a compound of all the
                    sympathetic ganglia of the four or five metameres of the hrachial plexus. It
                    forms the point of juncture of the deep and the SuperficiaI cervical sympathetic
                    portions. From the posterior region of the thorax backwards the right and left
                    strands run along their side of the vertebral coIumn, with a communicating
                    branch and a ganglion for each metamere; sometimes one or more successive
                    ganglia are combined, for instance near the cloaca. After having supplied the
                    latter, the sympathetic system appears exhausted and is continued into the taiI
                    by but a very thin strand, which runs between the caudal vein and artery. The
                    best iIIustrations of the sympathetic system are those by Vogt (neck of
                    crocodile), J. G. Fischer (many</p>

               </p>
               <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Tegumentary Organs of some Tactileor other Sense.—</hi>
                    Reptiles possess apparently no traces of those tegumentary sense organs which,
                    belonging to the domains of the trigeminal and vagus nerves, have spread far
                    over the body in fishes and batrachia. They were developed by those classes in
                    correlation with their essentially aquatic life. This does not apply to the
                    reptiles which, as a class, are of absolutely terrestrial origin. Nevertheless
                    all recent reptiles possess numerous low sense-organs, “ tactile bodies,” in
                    most parts of the skin, connected with the regional, spinal nerves. They are
                    most obvious in snakes, appearing as one or more little colourless spots near
                    the apex of each scale on the back. The spot is formed by a little cluster of
                    epidermal cells, connected with a sensory nerve. Their lowest stage they show in
                        <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and in lizards, whilst in crocodiles they
                    have reached a higher stage, at the bottom of the pit, since the tactile bodies,
                    mostly several together, have sunk into the cutis, below the epiderm, forming a
                    little pit, mostly near to the anterior margin of the flat scutes. They are most
                    obvious on the belly of crocodiles, whilst in the American alligator such pits
                    are scarcer, not because the organs are absent, but because these have sunk
                    still farther into the skin. The last stage is that met with in tortoises, which
                    possess such tactile bodies in considerable numbers in the softer subepidermal
                    layers, beneath the large horny shields which themselves show no traces of them.</p>
               <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Taste.—</hi> The respective organs do not seem to have been
                    investigated. That they exist is amply proved by the careful predilection for
                    certain kinds of food which is shown especially by vegetarian tortoises and
                    lizards, independent of smell. Many lizards are, for instance, very fond of
                    sugar.</p>
               <p>3. <hi rend="italic">Nose.—</hi> The sense of smell is well developed in all
                    reptiles. In none is the olfactory organ degraded; that the nasal passages, the
                    nose itself, are never degraded is explained by the fact that all reptiles
                    invariably breathe through the nose, except snakes during the act of swallowing
                    their prey. The nostrils, always paired, are frequently provided with valves, to
                    shut out the water, or sand. In some water tortoises, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
                        Trionyx, ChelyI <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> the nostrils are prolonged into a soft, unpaired proboscis. Double tubes
                    exist in the snake <hi rend="italic">Herpelon</hi> (see Snakes, Opis-thoglypha).
                    The nostril leads into an antrum or vestibulum, this again into the nasal cavity
                    proper, at the dorsal farther end enters the olfactory nerve, whilst ventrally
                    it leads into the naso-laryngeal duct, with its posterior narial opening, or
                    choana. The ducts are short in snakes and lizards, the choanae lying in the
                    front part of the palate, but in tortoises and crocodiles they are placed far
                    backwards, as·has been described under <hi rend="italic">Skull</hi> above. Into
                    the nasal cavity projects, from the septum, a concha, least developed in
                    tortoises, most in lizards and snakes. Crocodiles show a beginning of separation
                    into several conchae as in birds and mammals. A large nasal gland lies against
                    the lateral, or ventral, side of the outer wall of the nasal cavity, into which
                    also opens the naso-lacrymal duct. Jacobson’s organ, of uncertain function, is
                    present in most reptiles. It is paired. In tortoises it is still placed within
                    its nasal cavity, against the median wall, and is still nothing but a recess of
                    the same and its mucous lining. In lizards and snakes the organ has become
                    completely separated from the nasal cavity, lying below it and opening, each by
                    a separate passage, into the palate mouth, close to or still within the choanae.
                    In snakes it is mushroom-shaped, with a very short stalk. It lies immediately
                    below the floor of the nasal capsule, and the membranous wall of the cavity on
                    which it lies is covered and protected by a bone, commonly called the turbinal,
                    which extends out from the median nasal system to the maxilla. In crocodiles
                    these organs are vestigial and soon disappear:</p>
               <p>4. <hi rend="italic">Ear.—</hi> In crocodiles the outer ear lies in a recess,
                    dorsally overhung by the lateral edge of the bony squamoso-frontal hridge; it
                    carries a flap of skin, provided with muscles, to close the ear tightly. In
                    lizards the outer ear is quite unprotected, and when the meatus is very short
                    and wide, the drum is quite exposed. No reptiles possess cartilages comparable
                    to the mammalian outer ear. <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> chameleons, snakes
                    have no outer ear, the skin passing over the region. So also in tortoises, but
                    in some of the aquatic kinds its position is well indicated by softer and
                    thinner skin; in others, for instance marine turtles, a thick leathery plug, or
                    a bigger scale marks the former position. In various lizards, chiefly burrowing
                    in sand, the ear passage is very narrow, or closed. The middle ear or tympanic
                    cavity is quite obliterated in snakes, Amphisbaenas and some other snake-shaped
                    lizards. In <hi rend="italic">Anguis</hi> may exist individual traces. The
                    cavity communicates with the mouth. In lizards the communication is a wide
                    recess, lined with black pigment, so that in these creatures the whole auditory
                    chain can easily be inspected from the opened mouth. In tortoises the recesses
                    are contracted into the Eustachian tubes, each of which opens by a separate
                    aperture into the roof of the mouth. In the crocodiles part of the cavities is
                    transformed into an intricate system of canals and passages. The two Eustachian
                    tubes open together in the mid-lines protected by a valve, between the
                    basioccipital and basisphenoid; thence arises a median passage which with
                    lateral arms and loops extends upward through the occiput into the cranial roof,
                    communicating with the tympanic cavity, and further continued through the
                    quadrates and beyond into the mandibles, by the siphonium.</p>
               <p>In spite of the obliterated tympanic cavity of snakes, and the closed up outer
                    ear passage and absence of a tympanic membrane in snakes and tortoises, these
                    creatures can hear very well. The same applies to <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphcnodon,</hi> but it seems doubtful whether chameleons can hear.</p>
               <p>Through the whole middle ear, from the fenestra ovalis to the drum-membrane,
                    stretches the chain of auditory ossicles or cartilages, partly attached to the
                    posterior w’all by the common lining membrane. The arrangement appears simplest
                    in snakes, in chameleons and in tortoises, not because it is primitive but
                    because it is so much reduced, partly in correlation with the abolition of the
                    outer ear. In these creatures the columella goes as a bony, slender rod straight
                    to the middle of the quadrate, against which it leans, or with which it
                    articulates by a short piece of cartilage, the extra-columella. Here the whole
                    chain ends. It looks like a proof that columella=Stapes, extracolumella= incus,
                    and quadrate = malleus; or, w’ith the usual ignoring of the little
                    extra-columellar piece, that quadrate = incus, Gegenbauris favourite
                    impossibility. In those lizards which have a tympanic membrane conditions are
                    far less reduced. The extra-columellar piece sends out three distal processes;
                    one leans on to the middle of the tympanic membrane, the second usually is
                    fastened to the bony dorsal rim of the meatus, the third is directed downwards
                    and is continued as a thin ligament towards the inner angle of the articular of
                    the mandible, but * before reaching this it comes to grief, being squeezed in
                    between the quadrate and the posterior end of the pterygoid. The hyoid proper is
                    of no account in snakes and tortoises, since it is reduced to very short distal
                    pieces attached to the base of the tongue; but in lizards it remains in its
                    OriginalJength, or it even lengthens, and shows many vagaries in its position
                    and attachments. In embryos of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and lizards it
                    arises from near the junction of the columella with the extra-columella. It
                    becomes very long, too long for the available space (perhaps correlated with
                    lingual functions), and it forms a high loop, thereby causing the peculiar loop
                    of the chorda tympani; the upward bend of the hyoid becomes connected with the
                    parotic process of the cranium. Next aborts the portion between this connexion
                    and the original proximal end of the hyoid, near the columellar mass. The upper
                    end of the hyoid <hi rend="italic">either</hi> remains attached to the parotic
                    process (various lizards and <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon)</hi> whence the
                    lingual apparatus remains suspended, <hi rend="italic">or</hi> the hyoid, having
                    broken loose, leaves a little cartilage, Versluy’s cartilage, behind, at the end
                    of the parotic process, and the hyoid horn remains free, in the majority of
                    lizards. In <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> whilst</p>

               <p>passing the distal portion of the extra-columella, part of the hyoid fuses with
                    it, often forming thereby a Uttle hole, the remnant of imperfect fusion.</p>
               <p>In the crocodiles the arrangement is at first complete and diagrammatically
                    clear, not obscured by vagaries of the hyoid, which is free and much reduced. In
                    tbe embryo the large extra-columellar cartilage, abutting against the tympanic
                    membrane, and with another process against the quadrate, sends its third,
                    downward, process as a thick rod of cartilage to the posterior inner angle of
                    tbe mandible with which it is directly in cartilaginous continuity. It was W. K.
                    Parker’s mistake to call this cartilage the cerato-hyal. In young embryos it
                    looks like an upward continuation of Meckel’s cartilage, much resembling
                    mammalian conditions. But in nearly ripe embryos this cartilage is already
                    reduced to a string of connective tissue, cartilage remaining only at the upper
                    end, and where this string enters the mandible Ees the <hi rend="italic"
                        >siphonium,</hi> the tube which connects the air cavities of the mandible
                    with the Eustachian passages, the long connecting channel becoming—side by side
                    with the extracolumellar-mandibular ligament—embedded into a canal of the
                    quadrate, so that in older stages, and above all in the adult, the proper
                    display of the whole arrangement requires a little anatomical skill. The whole
                    string, whether cartilaginous or ligamentous, which connects the downward
                    extracolumellar process with the articulare, is of course homologous with the
                    continuation of Meckel’s cartilage into the malleus of foetal and young mammals;
                    and the chain of bones and cartilages between the auditory capsule, fenestra
                    ovalis, and the proximal part of the mandible is also homologous wherever such a
                    chain occurs; lastly, fenestra ovalis and membrana tympani are fixed points.

               <p>The <hi rend="italic">inner ear</hi> has been studied minutely and well by C.
                    Hasse, E. Clason and G. Retzius. It is enclosed by the periotic bones. The
                    fenestra rotunda is surmounted by the opisthotic, the fenestra ovalis by the
                    same and by the pro-otic, and this protects also the anterior vertical
                    semicircular canal. The posterior canal is opisthotic, the horizontal is pro-
                    and opisthotic. The anterior canal is the largest of the three, a feature
                    characteristic of the Sauropsida. The <hi rend="italic">lagena,</hi> with its
                    own acoustic papilla, begins to show a basilar membrane with papilla, at the
                    expense of that in the sacculus. In <hi rend="italic">Sphenadon</hi> and lizards
                    a slight curving of the lagena indicates the beginning of a cochlea, and a scala
                    is developed in crocodiles, but neither cochlea nor scala is specially twisted.
                    The endo-lymphatic ducts end as closed sacs, in lizards and snakes, in the roof
                    of the skull, between tbe occipital and parietal bones. They reach an enormous
                    deveIopment in many geckos, where they form large twisted sacs beneath the skin,
                    covering the sides of the neck, which then assumes a much swollen appearance.
                    They contain white otolithic masses, with lymph. It is remarkable that the
                    extent of these sacs varies not only in allied species, but even individually,
                    independent of sex and age, although they are naturalIy liable to increase with
                    age.</p>
               <p>5. <hi rend="italic">Eyes</hi> are present in all reptiles, although in many of
                    the burrowing snakes and lizards they may be so completely covered by the skin
                    as to have lost their function. Most reptiles have upper and lower lids, moved
                    by palpebral muscles, and a third lid, the nictitating membrane, which can be
                    drawn over the front of the cornea from the inner angle obliquely up and
                    backwards. Its mechanism is simplest in lizards. A muscle, a split from the
                    retractor muscle of the eyeball, arises from the posterior part of the orbit, is
                    attached to the posterior wall of the eyeball, and there forms a pulley for the
                    long tendon which arises from the median side of the orbit and passes over the
                    back of the ball forwards into the nictitating [membrane. Contraction of this
                    muscle draws the membrane backwards and over the eye. In crocodiles and
                    tortoises the tendon of the nictitating membrane broadens out into a muscle <hi
                        rend="italic">(M. pyramidalis),</hi> which arises from the median side of
                    the posterior portion of the ball; above the optic nerve it crosses over the
                    broad insertion of the retractor of the ball, without being much guided by it,
                    although this muscle by its contraction slightly prevents the nictitating tendon
                    and muscle from touching the optic nerve.</p>
               <p>It is easy to recognize the mechanism of birds as a combination of the two types
                    just described; their ,musc, quadrates s. bursalis is of course the single
                    muscle of the lizards, but now restricted to, and broadened out upon, the
                    eyeball.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Special Modifications of the Lids.—</hi> In the snakes the
                    upper and lower lids are reduced to the rim, and the nictitating membrane has
                    become the permanent cover, which protects the eye like a watch-glass, leaving
                    between itself and the cornea a space, drained by the naso-lacrymal duct, and
                    behind this space the eyeball moves as freely as in other animals. A similar
                    arrangement exists in th,e true geckos, not in the Eublepharidae, which still
                    possess the outer lids. In some lizards, especially such as live in deserts, the
                    middle of the Iower lid has a transparent disk, and it is always the lower lid
                    which is drawn over the eye, the upper in nearly all Sauropsida being much
                    smaller and less movable; for instance, some specimens of the Lacertine genus
                        <hi rend="italic">Eremias</hi> in Africa and India. In the Indian genus <hi
                        rend="italic">Cabrita,</hi> and in <hi rend="italic">Ophiops</hi> of Africa
                    and India, the lower lid is permanently fused with the rim of the shrunken upper
                    lid and forms a transparent window superficially looking like that of the
                    snakes. Exactly the same arrangement has been developed by <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ablepharus,</hi> one of the Scincidae.</p>
               <p>The eyeball is provided with the usuaI rectus and obliquus muscles, in addition
                    to a retractor oculi. Apparently all reptiles possess a pair of Harderian or
                    nictitating glands, which open in front, in the nasal, inner comer, and lacrymal
                    glands which open likewise into the conjunctival sac, but near the outer or
                    temporal comer. The secretion of both is drained off through the lacrymal
                    canals,' which in lizards open below in the outer wall of the posterior nares;
                    in snakes they open into the mouth by a narrow aperture on the inner side of the
                    palatine bone.</p>
               <p>The walls of the anterior half of the sclerotic of lizards, tortoises and <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphenadon</hi> contain numerous cartilaginous or osseous
                    plates, which imbricate in ring shape; they are absent in snakes and crocodiles.
                    Internally the eye of most reptiles possesses at least traces of a pecten; very
                    small indeed in tortoises, or in crocodiles where it is represented by only a
                    few mosslike, pigmented vessels. In many lizards these vessels, arising from
                    near the optic nerve, form a network which extends right up to the posterior
                    side of the lens; in others, especially in Iguanidae, is developed a typical,
                    large pecten, deeply pigmented with black, fan-shaped or umbrella-shaped,
                    sometimes folded. In chameleons it is a short cone; apparently</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0162" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0185.jp2"/>
               <p>quite absent in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon.</hi> A falciform process and other
                    remnants of a campanula are absent. In most of those reptiles which have but a
                    rudimentary pecten, the retina is supplied by hyaloid vessels which spread over
                    the surface of the vitreous body; such superficial vessels disappear with a
                    greater development of the pecten, and the retina receives a choroid supply;
                    special retinal arteries from the a. centralis retinae, and veins, exist in
                    snakes.</p>
               <p>Ciliary processes of the choroid are usually small, a proper ciliary body being
                    least· developed in crocodiles; all reptiles have a ciliary muscle. The shape of
                    the contracted pupil varies from round to a vertical slit; the latter is most
                    marked in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The retina shows usually a fovea centralis, sometimes but slightly indicated by
                    a shallow <hi rend="sup">7</hi> depression; it is well marked in chameleons. The
                    retina contains only cones, rods being absent; fat-drops on the apex of the
                    cones are common; their usual colours are green and blue.</p>
               <p>6. <hi rend="italic">The pineal, median</hi> or <hi rend="italic">parietal
                        eye</hi> is the terminal organ of the epiphysis of the brain, with which it
                    is connected by a nerve-containing string. Among recent reptiles it exists in
                        <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and in the Lacertilia, with vestiges in
                    snakes. It is embedded in the median parietal foramen. Externally its presence
                    is generally marked by the scales being arranged in a rosette, with a
                    transparent central scale. The organ itself is distinctly a dioptric apparatus,
                    with all the essential features of an eye; a pigmented retina of the
                    arthropodous simple type surrounds an inner chamber which is nearly filled by a
                    cellular globular mass which projects into it from above; this is the so-called
                    lens, in reality much more like the corpus vitreum in its still cellular
                    condition, while the real lens has to be looked for in the superimposed tissue.
                    The whole organ is best developed in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> even in
                    the adult; but whether it is still functional, and what its function is, remain
                    unknown. The throwing of a beam of light upon this eye, by means of a lens,
                    produces no effect. Whilst in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> the “ lens ” is
                    rather dull and the efferent nerve is still present, in various lizards the “
                    lens ” is more perfect, but the nerve is degenerated. We conclude that the whole
                    organ is now without the least visual function, whilst in various extinct groups
                    of reptiles and Stego-cephali it was fully developed. It has been well
                    investigated by de Graaff, W. B. Spencer and A. Dendy.</p>

               </p>
               <p>A useful account of the differentiation of the muscles in the main reptilian
                    groups, with their almost endless modifications in correlation with walking,
                    climbing, swimming, gliding and burrowing, with limbs complete or absent, would
                    fill several pages of this article and would necessitate many illustrations. The
                    literature is great; it comprises many good detailed descriptions of various
                    kinds of reptiles, and several monographs. M. Fiirbringer has devoted a whole
                    series to the muscles of the neck, shoulder-girdle and fore limbs. Hand in hand
                    with these investigations went that of the innervation, without which myology
                    would lack scientific value. The present writer has devoted much time to the
                    muscles and nerves of the pelvis and hind limbs, and has, in tabular form,
                    compared them with those of other vertebrates. The results of all these labours
                    are rather disappointing, except for the study of myology as such, which raises
                    many interesting questions. Broadly speaking, the muscles of typical reptiles,
                    crocodiles and lizards are more highly differentiated (by no means always more
                    numerous, but more individualized by origin and insertion, the behaviour of the
                    tendons), more effectively disposed according to mechanical principles, than in
                    Batrachia, and less than in birds and mammals. This can easily be proved,
                    whether we take for comparison the muscles of the neck, of the larynx or hyoid,
                    or limbs. Lowest .in general stands <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> next to it
                    the lizards, highest the crocodiles, while tortoises and snakes show the
                    greatest reduction and specialization. In the tortoises it is the non-yielding
                    box of carapace and plastron which has caused great changes within the region of
                    the trunk proper. First, all the epiaxial muscles have vanished; the same
                    applies to the costal muscles; but traces of dorso-lateral muscles occur on the
                    inside of the posterior half of the carapace, extending' as a longitudinal
                    system from one transverse process to the next in many of the lower aquatic
                    tortoises, as perfectly useless vestiges; or more striking, these muscles exist
                    in the young, and disappear with age, for instance in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Testudo.</hi> Secondly, it is rather surprising that the rigid shell has
                    offered so little or no inducement to the muscles of the girdles, neck and tail
                    to transfer their origins upon it. Thirdly, the retractile neck of the typical
                    cryptodirous tortoises is correlated with a pair of long retractor muscles,
                    which in the shape of a pair of broad, vertical ribbons (between which is
                    received the S-kinked neck) extend far back along the vertebral column, almost
                    to the level of the pelvis.</p>
               <p>In snakes, owing to the loss of limbs and girdles, only the spinal and costal
                    muscles remain, besides of course those of the abdomen and the visceral arches.
                    The vestigial muscles of the limbless lizards and of the peropodous snakes have
                    been monographed by Furbringer in much detail without great results.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Respiratory Organs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All reptiles breathe by lungs, and they possess no vestiges of gills, not even
                    during their embryonic stages, although gill clefts are invariably present in
                    the embryo. Nor does any part of the outer skin assist respiration, as is so
                    commonly the case in Batrachia; yet, strictly speaking, the lungs are not the
                    only organs of· respiration in the class of reptiles, since various tortoises
                    possess additional breathing apparatus in the anal sacs and in certain recesses
                    of the throat, to be mentioned farther on.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Larynx,</hi> instead of lying at' the bottom and far back
                    in the throat, as in the Batrachia, is considerably moved forwards so as to rest
                    upon the hyoid and to project into the pharyngeal cavity. A pair of arytenoid
                    cartilages, enclosing the glottis, rest upon several more or less fused tracheal
                    cartilages, which thus represent the cricoid, but there is no thyroid cartilage.
                    A small process from the anterior median edge of the cricoid is the beginning of
                    an epiglottis. Vocal chords are indicated by lateral projecting folds of the
                    inner membranous lining of the larynx, and are in a few cases effective in
                    producing a voice. Crocodiles and alligators have a powerful, loud, bellowing
                    voice; many tortoises utter weak, piping sounds, especially during the pairing
                    season; and also various lizards can emit a feeble squeak, for instance, <hi
                        rend="italic">Psammodromus hispanicus,</hi> and the geckos. <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> at least the males, can grunt. Snakes have no
                    voice; they can only hiss like all other reptiles, but a curious modification
                    exists in the larynx of the North American <hi rend="italic">Coluber s.
                        Pityophis,</hi> e.g. <hi rend="italic">C. melanoleucus:</hi> the epiglottis
                    is more enlarged, and laterally compressed so that the hissing sound is much
                    strengthened by the vibration of the epiglottis. The larynx possesses a
                    constrictor and a dilator muscle, which arise from the arytenoids and from the
                    cricoid respectively, and are attached to the hyoid. Chameleons have
                    bladder-shaped sacs which can be filled with air from a slit immediately below
                    the larynx. For further modifications see G. Tomier.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Trachea</hi> is furnished with cartilaginous rings and
                    semirings, which extend to the lungs. As a rule the trachea is straight; in <hi
                        rend="italic">Crocodilus americanus</hi> it forms a loop; and similar
                    curvings occur in various tortoises in correlation with the retractile neck. The
                    two <hi rend="italic">bronchi</hi> are shortest in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphenodon,</hi> very long in most tortoises, where they begin frequently
                    already half down the neck. In <hi rend="italic">Sphargis</hi> most of the
                    trachea is divided by a longitudinal partition. It is an advance upon amphibian
                    conditions that the bronchus enters its lung no longer at its apex, since an
                    anterior, pre-bronchial lung-portion has come into existence. This is still very
                    short in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> while in crocodiles, tortoises and in
                    the highly developed Varanidae the bronchus enters near the middle of its lung,
                    so that the anterior portion is nearly as long as the posterior. The shape of
                    the trunk influences that of the lungs. In the snake-shaped forms, both snakes
                    and lizards alike, the lungs have become</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0163" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0186.jp2"/>
               <p>very asymmetrical, one of them being much larger than the other, which is often
                    quite aborted.</p>
               <p>The simplest form of lungs is that of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon*,</hi> the pre
                        <hi rend="sup">j</hi> bronchial part is still small. Each lung is still a
                    sac with one large lumen, the walls being honeycombed. In the lizards the walls
                    are more spongy, and several septa begin to extend more or less far from the
                    walls into the lumen, towards each bronchus. Some of these septa begin to cut
                    the lung into lobes, especially in <hi rend="italic">Varanus</hi> and in
                    chameleons. In the latter exists a further SpeciaHzation, a side-departure, in
                    the shape of several long, hollow processes which are sent out from the
                    posterior portions of the lungs and extend far into the body-cavity and between
                    the viscera. By means of them these creatures can “ blow ” themselves out. They
                    are of morphological interest since they are first stages of air-sacs so
                    marvellously developed in birds, and possibly also in various Dinosaurs. In the
                    Amphisbaenids the left lung alone remains.</p>
               <p>The lungs of crocodiles have reached a considerably higher stage. They alone in
                    reptiles are, on the ventral side, completely shut off from the viscera by a
                    pleural, partly mus-cularized, membrane. From each bronchus extend a number of
                    broad septa towards the periphery, dividing the originally single lumen into
                    many chambers, perhaps a dozen, from the walls of which wide secondary or
                    parabronchial canals extend into the alveolar meshwork, in very regular
                    arrangement, in series like organ-pipes.</p>
               <p>The lungs of the tortoises are, in adaptation to the peculiar shape of the body,
                    stowed away along the back, as far as the pelvis, and only their ventral surface
                    is covered by a strong peritoneal membrane which receives muscular,
                    diaphragmatic fibres. The inner division of the lungs into chambers has
                    progressed so much that a sort of mesobronchus has become discernible; the
                    arrangement of the side-bronchi is far less regular than in crocodiles; the
                    whole lung is much more honeycombed, meshy and spongy.</p>
               <p>The mechanism of breathing of tortoises is not such a puzzle as it is sometimes
                    stated to be. Of course the rigid box of the trunk excludes any costal, or
                    abdominal breathing, but by protruding the limbs or the neck, piston-like, an
                    effective vacuum is produced in the box. Moreover, the throat is distended and
                    WOrked considerably by the unusually large and very movable hyoid apparatus, by
                    which air is pumped into the lungs.</p>
               <p>The lungs of the snakes are very thin-walled, with a very wide lumen, and only
                    for about the first half from the heart backwards the walls are alveolar enough
                    for actual respiratory function, while towards the blind end the sacs are so
                    thin and sparsely vascularized that they act mainly as reservoirs of a large
                    amount of air. Frequently their posterior portions receive blood vessels not
                    from the pulmonary arteries but directly from those of the trunk. In correlation
                    with tKe long, cylindrical body, the lungs are much elongated and they are not
                    equally developed. The asymmetry shows great differences in the various groups,
                    consequently the asymmetry has been developed independently in those groups. It
                    is usually stated that the left lung is much smaller than the right. This is but
                    rarely the case. The most recent observations are those of E. D. Cope <hi
                        rend="italic">(Proc. Am. Phil. Soc.</hi> (1894), xxxiii. 217). In Boidae
                    both lungs are large, although unequal: the left or more dorsally placed one
                    being the larger. In <hi rend="italic">Ilysia</hi> the right is functional, the
                    left is ventral and vestigial. In <hi rend="italic">Rhinophis</hi> the right is
                    very small, the left larger. In <hi rend="italic">Glauconia</hi> and <hi
                        rend="italic">Typhlops</hi> the right Iung alone is developed: the left
                    is-quite aborted. In CoIubridae the left lung alone is functional, while the
                    right is vestigial. Thereisno trace of the right in Elapinae and Hydro-phinae
                    and most Viperidae. In the Colubridae the right, or ventral, lung is, when
                    present at all, reduced to a length of from 2-5 mm., and it then communicates
                    with the anterior portion of the left lung by a foramen, in level of the heart,
                    whilst the right bronchus is aborted.</p>
               <p>A further complication is the so-called tracheal lung, which is present in
                    Typhlopidae, <hi rend="italic">Ungalia</hi> of the Boidae, in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Chersydrus</hi> of the Acrochordinae, in the Hydrophinae and Viperidae.
                    This peculiar organ is a continuation of the anterior portion of the functional
                    lung, extending far headwards, along the trachea, with the lumen of which it
                    communicates by numerous openings. In <hi rend="italic">Chersydrus</hi> this
                    mysterious organ is “ composed of coarse cells and without lumen, extends from
                    the heart to the head, and is discontinuous with the true lung; the trachea
                    communicates with it by a series of symmetrical pores on each side.” In <hi
                        rend="italic">Typhlops</hi> it extends likewise from the heart to the
                    throat, as a cellular body but without Iumen or connexion with either trachea or
                    lung.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Thyroid and Thymus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Thyroid</hi> of the reptiles is a single, unpaired organ,
                    placed ventrally upon the trachea and one or other of the arterial trunks, more
                    or less distant from the heart. In snakes it lies on the mid-line near the
                    heart; a little farther up in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon*,</hi> still farther
                    in lizards, and chameleons near the root of their gular sac. In tortoises it is
                    globular, at the division of the carotic trunk. In crocodiles it is bilobed.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Thymus</hi> is paired. It is largest in crocodiles,
                    extending on either side of nearly the whole neck, along the carotids and
                    jugulars. In the tortoises they are much shorter; in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphenodon</hi> and lizards are two pairs, more or less eIongated; in the
                    snakes are sometimes as many as three pairs, elongated but small, attached to
                    the carotis near the heart. As usual the thymus bodies become much reduced with
                    age.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">The Spleen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Spleen</hi> varies much in shape and position. In lizards
                    it is mostly roundish, elongated in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> and placed
                    near the stomach; in crocodiles it lies in the duodenal loop behind the
                    pancreas; similarly situated in snakes, but in the tortoises it is much
                    concentrated, large and attached to the hind-gut.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">The Body Cavity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">body cavity</hi> of the reptiles is subdivided into
                    several sacs or cavities by serous membranes of peritoneal origin. The number of
                    these subcavities differs much in the various groups. The pericardial sac is
                    always complete. In tortoises the lungs are retro-peritoneal, a dense serous
                    membrane spreading over their ventral surface from the walls of the carapace
                    forwards to the Uver and shutting off a saccus hepato-pulmonalis from the rest
                    of the peritoneal cavity. Snakes possess, besides the modifications mentioned
                    above, separate chambers for the stomach, right and left liver, and for the gut,
                    whilst the pleural cavities as such have been destroyed. In lizards a “
                    post-hepatic septum ” divides liver, lungs and heart from the rest of the
                    intestines. This transverse vertical septum is best developed, almost complete,
                    in some of the Tejidae, in others it seems to be more imperfect, and it is
                    probably a further development of the SuspensoriaI ligament of the liver, which
                    is ultimately inserted upon the ventral wall of the body.</p>
               <p>The subdivisions have reached their highest development in the crocodiles, there
                    being, besides the pericardial and the two pleural cavities and the usual
                    peritoneal room, a right and left hepato-pericardiac, an hepato-gastric, and an
                    hepato-pulmonal sac. The caudal and ventral edges of these liver-sacs are fused
                    on to the ventral body-wall, thus producing a complete transverse partition,
                    headwards of which lie the lungs, liver and heart. This partition,
                    morphologically not homologous with the mammalian diaphragm, more resembling the
                    imperfect structure in birds, acts, however, as a perfect diaphragm, since it is
                    well furnished with muscular fibres. These are attached to its whole periphery,
                    with centripetal direction, especially on the ventral half. These fibres are
                    transgressors upon this septum from a broad sheet of muscles, which, inserted
                    together with the septum upon the body-wall, arise from the iliac bones, the
                    pubes, and the greater portion of the last pair of abdominal ribs. This broad
                    muscular sheet, covering the intestines, is the so-called abdominal diaphragm or
                    peritoneal muscle. Its continuation upon the transverse septum is the
                    crocodilian musc, diaphragmaticus, and in functional effect very similar</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0164" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0187.jp2"/>
               <p>to that of the Mammalia, whilst the abdominal diaphragm undoubtedly causes
                    abdominal respiration. We have seen that these crocodilian conditions do not
                    stand quite alone, but are connected with simpler features in the other
                    reptiles. Two recent, very lengthy papers have been written on this subject by
                    I. Bromann (1904) and by F. Hochstetter (1906), besides two in 1902 by G.
                    Butler.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">The Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Heart</hi> of all reptiles is removed from the head and is
                    placed well in the thorax, in the Varanidae even a little beyond it. Only in
                    snakes the heart lies headwards from the hilus of the lungs, not caudälwards,
                    generally at about the end of the first fifth of the body. The batrachian conus
                    arteriosus is reduced, one set of semilunar valves guarding the entrances into
                    the truncus arteriosus which now issues directly from the heart. A sinus venosus
                    exists still in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and Chelonians, in which it may
                    even receive separate hepatic veins, but in crocodiles, lizards and snakes the
                    sinus as such exists no longer, forming part of the right atrium. AU the hepatic
                    veins enter the stem of the posterior vena cava, which henceforth enters the
                    heart as inferior vena cava. This, the largest, and the right and left anterior
                    vena cavae, are the only three veins which enter the right atrium. Into the left
                    open the two pulmonary veins. Right and left atrium have in all reptiles a
                    complete septum between them. The ventricular portion shows considerable steps
                    towards the differentiation into a right and a left ventricle, but the partition
                    is very incomplete in tortoises, lizards and snakes, quite complete only in the
                    crocodiles. The most important character of the reptilian heart, absolutely
                    diagnostic of it, is the fact that the systemic vessel which leaves the right
                    ventricle turns to the left to form the left aorta, while the stem which comes
                    from the left ventricular half arches over to the right as the right aorta. It
                    is not at all necessary to conclude that this fact excludes the reptiles from
                    the mammalian ancestry and to hark back to conditions as indifferent as are
                    those of the batrachia. The Foramen Panizzae shows the way to a solution, how
                    ultimately all the arterial blood from the left ventricle may pass, first
                    through the root of the right arch, then through this hole into the left, whilst
                    the rest of the right arch, and the root of the left, obliterate. The difficulty
                    is not much greater than that of deriving the birds’ condition from the
                    reptilian. The Foramen Panizzae, which exists only in the Crocodilia, lies
                    exactly where the right crosses dorsally over the left aorta. The whole is <hi
                        rend="italic">not</hi> the last remnant of the originally undivided truncus,
                    as is taught generally, but it is a new foramen, a hole dug by the left arterial
                    blood into the venous right aorta. According to the recent observations made by
                    F. Hochstetter the foramen comes into existence in a very late embryonic stage.</p>
               <p>Whilst the batrachian single ventricle possesses only one ostium Ventriculare or
                    outlet into the truncus, in the reptiles the inter-atrial, septum extends
                    considerably downwards into the base of the ventricle, so as to produce a right
                    and a left niche, and correspondingly two ostia instead of one. The
                    atrioventricular valves are still membranous, even in crocodiles; attached to
                    them are muscles, trabeculae cameae, from the very trabecular walls of the
                    ventricle; they are especially spongy in tortoises. By means of the arrangement
                    of some of these trabeculae, perhaps still more through the confluence of their
                    basal portions, an imperfect ventricular septum is initiated. Certainly even in
                    tortoises, which represent the lowest stage, the venous blood is received into
                    and sent out by the same right side of the ventricle, while the arterial blood
                    is correspondingly managed and dodged by the left side. That there is not very
                    much mixture of the two kinds of blood, in spite of the wide communication in
                    the ventricle, is further due to the peristaltic systole and diastole of the
                    various divisions of the heart.—The heart of Chelonians is broader than long. In
                    correlation with the very much flattened body of <hi rend="italic">Trionyx</hi>
                    and its allied genera, the whole heart is dislodged from the middle line, far
                    over to the right side; the vessels of the left side are correspondingly much

                    obliquely beneath the right and gives off only the coeliac, just before joining
                    the right aorta in the level of the eighth thoracic vertebra. The aorta
                    descendens sends off, besides intercostals and other segmentais into the
                    body-wall, the mesenteric, right and left iliac, a pair of renal and ischiadics,
                    a cloacal and the caudal artery. The <hi rend="italic">right</hi> aorta forms
                    the main root of the a. descendens. Close to the heart it sends off two
                    coronaries and a short carotis primaria which divides at once into two anonymae,
                    the left of which is the stronger. The right anonyma divides into the subclavia
                    and collateralis colli, the left into subclavia and carotis subverte-bralis.
                    Each subclavia sends off an a. Vertebralis communis, which runs headwards and,
                    with another longer branch, downwards, giving off intercostals, and then joins
                    the descending aorta.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Tortoises.</hi> —The <hi rend="italic">left</hi> aorta is
                    rather more separated from the truncus, which it crosses ventrally in an oblique
                    forward direction; it sends off a left cardiac to stomach and oesophagus, a
                    coeliac and mesenteric, and then a communicating branch to the right aorta. The
                    a. descendens gives off paired supra-renals, spermatics, very large iliacs, then
                    a pair of renals, hypogastrics and the caudal. Each iliac artery divides into a
                    recurrent intercostal anastomosing with the axillaries, an epigastric (sending
                    off the crural and anastomosing with thoracics and humerais), and other arteries
                    to abdominal muscles and to the shell. The hypogastrics supply the cloacal
                    region and then continue as the ischiadics. But there are many anastomoses which
                    cause great variation in the different tortoises. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >right</hi> aorta sends off a right cardiac, the coronary, and the right and
                    left anonymae which are quite symmetrical, each dividing into subclavia and
                    carotis; in the angle lies the thymus.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Lizards.—</hi> Two common carotids arise either side by side,
                    or by one carotis primaria, from the right aortic root. In the majority each
                    common carotis ascends the neck and then divides into the vessels for the head
                    and another branch which turns back and goes into the descending part of the
                    aortic arch. In chameleons two carotid stems ascend the neck and there is no
                    recurrent vessel. In the Varanidae the two common carotids start from a long
                    carotis primaria; there is no recurrent vessel. The vertebral arteries come from
                    the origin of the subclavians and run to the head in a very lateral position.
                    The subclavian arteries (which occùr also in limbless lizards) arise far away
                    from the carotids out of the descending arch of the right aorta, in a level
                    often far behind the heart. “ Anonymous ” arteries are consequently absent in
                    lizards.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Snakes.</hi> —The left aorta is stronger than the right, both
                    combining soon to form the descending aorta. Owing to the absence of fore limbs
                    and shoulder-girdle the conditions are much simplified. In most snakes the right
                    aorta sends off but one strong carotic vessel which represents the left carotis
                    communis whilst the right is much reduced or even quite absent; further, there
                    is only one vertebral artery, which either runs along the right side of the
                    vertebral column or it divides soon into a right and a left vessel along the
                    neck. In conformity with the reduction of one lung there is usually but one
                    pulmonary vessel.</p>

               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Crocodiles.—</hi> Éach, right and left, anterior vena cava is
                    composed of a subclavian (axillary and external jugular), an internal jugular,
                    common vertebral and an internal mammary vein. The posterior vena cava is
                    composed of the two revehent renais, veins from the genital glands and ducts,
                    revehent veins of the Suprarenals (which, like birds, still have a portal
                    system), and the big vein from the fat body. Thus the vena cava posterior</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0165" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0188.jp2"/>
               <p>perforates the right liver, receiving from it many hepatic revehent veins and
                    also the big revehent vessel from the left lobe; next it receives the coronary
                    vein and then enters the heart as inferior vena cava. The portal vein arises out
                    of the coccygo-mesenteric (which comes out of the bifurcation of the caudal),
                    collecting the blood from most abdominal viscera and from the thorax and breaks
                    up in the right liver. The rest of the venous system is rather complicated. The
                    big caudal vessel divides near the vent, receives an unpaired cloacal and a
                    rectal vessel, and goes off to the right and left, each of which trunks receives
                    an ischiadic and an inter-sacral vein and then divides into the v. renalis
                    advehens which breaks up in the kidney, and the abdominal vein. The latter are
                    interesting; they run in the abdominal wall, receive the obturator and other
                    pelvic veins, Intervertebrals and intercostals, the crurals, and the epigastrics
                    out of the body-wall. Then these two abdominals (Rathke’s internal epigastrics)
                    go to the liver, which they enter to either side of the gall bladder, collecting
                    also blood from the stomach and from the vertebral column. Both break up in the
                    liver. Consequently all the blood from “ below the heart ” passes through some
                    portal system—renal or hepatic—except that which comes from the genital glands
                    and ducts and from the fat body.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Tortoises.—</hi> The venous system much resembles that of the
                    crocodiles, but many and wide anastomoses, especially on the inside of the
                    carapace and plastron, exist between often distant vessels, so that one lucky
                    injection may fill the whole system. There are three advehent renal veins which
                    collect on the back of their kidney into one stem; they dissolve completely into
                    a portal system, and leave the kidney on its ventral surface as one v. renalis
                    revehens. The right and left then' form the v. c. posterior which perforates the
                    posterior margin of the right liver, then headwards of the liver takes up the
                    hepatic and enters the heart. The three pairs of afferent renal veins are
                    composed as follows. The externa collects from the shell and the abdominal
                    muscles; the posterior collects along the rectum from the genital glands, the
                    bladder, and from parts of other pelvic viscera; the anterior comes from the
                    anterior part of the shell and runs backwards to the kidney, with frequent
                    anastomoses with the other advehent renal veins. The abdominals arise, as in the
                    crocodiles, with the external advehent renal from the lateral continuation of
                    the bifurcated caudal, which takes up vessels from the pelvis, the shell and the
                    crural. The abdominal itself takes up a femoral vein, vessels from the abdominal
                    and pelvic muscles, and from the plastron, and then dives into the body-cavity,
                    receives veins from the fore limbs, and enters the right lobe of the liver,
                    there to break up.’ The hepatic portal collects fromthe intestinal tract, spleen
                    and pancreas. Consequently in tortoises all the blood from beIow the heart
                    passes through some portal system.</p>
               <p>The most important peculiarity of the Lizards is the condition of the abdominal
                    veins ; they combine into a single stem (after having collected the blood from
                    the fat body and from the ventral body-wall of the pelvic region) which dives
                    into the body-cavity to join, embedded in the ventral hepatic ligament, the left
                    branch of the portal vein. The chief characteristic of the abdominal is that it
                    does not communicate directly with the caudal, and that it forms an unpaired
                    stem. The renal portal system receives its blood from the tail, the hind limbs,
                    the abdominal wall and the urino-genital organs, all the blood passing into a
                    right and a left advehent vein. The suprarenal portal system drains from the
                    abdominal wall and the suprarenal bodies, and issues into the revehent renals.
                    These, with some intervertebrals and with hepatics, constitute the inferior vena
                    cava.</p>

               </p>
               <p>The lymphatic vessels frequently accompany the big arteries of the trunk, either
                    surrounding them with a meshwork or ensheathing them completely, .especially ‘
                    in tortoises. The lymphatics from the head and neck combine with stems which
                    accompany the veins of the fore limbs; they join the thoracic ducts and these
                    open into the brachio-cephalic veins, as they do in birds. The lymph from the
                    tail flows into the ischiadic veins or into the advehent renal veins. Reptiles
                    possess only a posterior pair of lymph-hearts; they are placed near the root of
                    the tail against the ends of one of the transverse processes. In snakes they lie
                    in a space protected by the ribs and transverse processes of the original sacral
                    vertebrae. Lymph glands proper are not developed in reptiles, except in the
                    shape of the so-called mesentericj;land of crocodiles.</p>

               <p>The red corpuscles are invariably oval, and, since they still possess a nucleus,

                    much larger than those of mammals, considerably larger than those of most birds,
                    and in turn much smaller than those of amphibia.</p>

               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Teeth.</hi> —All the groups of recent reptiles have teeth,
                    except the tortoises, which have lost even embryonic traces of them. In the
                    under jaw they are restricted to the dentary bones. In the upper they are almost
                    universal in the maxilla and premaxilla, although the latter has lost them in
                    most of the snakes. The pterygoids are toothed in most snakes and in a few
                    lizards, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Lacerta</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Iguana.</hi>
                    The palatines are toothed-in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and in some
                    lizards.</p>
               <p>Only the young of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and the chameleons have a few
                    small teeth on the vomer. The teeth themselves consist of dentine with a cap of
                    enamel and with cementum around their base. In the crocodiles they are planted
                    into separate alveoles in the maxilla, premaxilla and under jaw. In lizards they
                    are either pleurodont, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> they stand in a series upon a
                    longitudinal ridge which projects from the Bngual side of the supporting bone,
                    or they stand upon the upper rim of the bone, acrodont. In either case they are,
                    when full grown, cemented on to the bone. Acrodont are amongst lizards only the
                    Agamidae; the Tejidae are intermediate, almost acrodont. All the snakes and <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphe-nodon</hi> are acrodont. The latter is in so far peculiar
                    as its broad-based, somewhat triangular teeth are much worn down in old
                    specimens; originally there are several in the premaxilla, but the adults bite
                    with the somewhat curved-down portions of the premaxillaries themselves, or with
                    what remains of the anchy-Iosed bases of the original teeth, which then,
                    together with the bone, look like a pair of large chisel-shaped incisors. The
                    lateral edges of the palatines of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> likewise
                    carry teeth, those of the mandibles fit into a long slit-like space between the
                    palatine and the maxillary teeth. This is a unique arrangement. Further, it is
                    surprising that in this old, Rhyncho-cephalian type the supply of teeth has
                    become exhausted, whilst in the other recent reptiles the supply is continuous
                    and apparently inexhaustible. The new teeth He on the lingual side of the old
                    set, and long before the new tooth is finished part of the base of its older
                    neighbour is absorbed, so that the pulp-cavity which persists in nearly all
                    reptilian teeth becomes free. Ultimately the old tooth is pushed off and the new
                    is cemented into its place. In the crocodiles it has come to pass that several
                    sets of teeth are lodged more or less into one another’s bases. Where crocodiles
                    and alligators collect habitually the ground is sometimes found strewn with
                    thousands of teeth, large and small, every creature shedding about seventy teeth
                    many times during its long life.</p>
               <p>Some or all teeth of various families of lizards and snakes have a more or less
                    pronounced groove or furrow along their anterior convex curve. The usefulness of
                    this furrow in facilitating the entering of saliva into the bitten wound is
                    merely incidental, but this preformed feature has in many snakes been improved
                    into a fearful weapon. In the Opisthoglypha a few of the most posterior teeth in
                    the maxilla are enlarged, have deeper furrows, and lie in the vicinity of the
                    poison ducts. In the Proteroglypha one or two of the most anterior maxillary</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0166" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0189.jp2"/>
               <p>teeth are enlarged and furnished with a deep groove for the reception of poison.
                    In the Solcnoglypha or'Viperidae the enlarged teeth of the Opisthoglypha have
                    moved to the front, owing to reduction of the anterior portion of the maxilla.
                    The latter, much shortened, moves with the firmly anchylosed poison fang upon
                    the prefrontal as its pivot, being pushed forward, or “ erected,” by the
                    ectopterygoid bone, which connects it with the pterygoid, and this in turn can
                    be moved forwards and backwards, together with the quadrate. (See fig. 24, skull
                    of <hi rend="italic">Vipera Hasicornis</hi> and the diagram of the mechanism in
                    article Snakes.) In the still unfinished fang the furrow is open, later the
                    edges close together and the end of the duct of the gland itself is surrounded
                    by the substance of the growing basal portion of the tooth, so that the furrow
                    is converted into a canal continuous with that of the gland. The poison is now
                    sure to be projected into the very deepest part of the wound with the precision
                    of a surgical instrument. The Pro-teroglypha, with their long, non-erectile
                    maxillae, bite, or, like</p>

                    rather strike with the mouth widely open. The teeth of snakes and lizards are
                    often of irregular size; but it is rare that a kind of differentiation into
                    incisors, canines and molars occurs. In many lizards, especially in Iguanidae,
                    some teeth are multicuspid, trilobed, or somewhat serrated; in <hi rend="italic"

               <p>Lizards and snakes are born with an “ egg-tooth ” which is lost a day or two
                    after hatching. Its function is the filing through of the eggshell. This tooth,

                    long and half a millimetre broad at its base, which rests upon a middle
                    depression of the premaxillary bone; it stands forward above the mouth and is
                    curved upwards. In crocodiles and tortoises the same effect is produced by
                    another organ, which, as in birds, lies well outside the mouth on the top of the
                    end of the snout and consists of a little cone of calcified epidermis.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Tongue.</hi> —The tongue of the crocodiles is very broad and
                    flat, and with nearly its w hole broad base attached to the floor of the mouth;
                    however, in its whole circumference its edge is well marked, and it arises on
                    its hinder border as a transverse fold which meets a similar fold descending
                    from the palate in front of the posterior nares. By these folds the mouth can be
                    completely shut off from the nasal passages into the trachea. The upper surface
                    of the tongue contains several dozen large flat papillae, each with a central
                    pit-like opening; it is not known whether they are gustatory organs. Besides
                    scarce mucous glands on the tongue, there is an absence of salivary glands in
                    the mouth. The tongue of tortoises is likewise short, broad, and not
                    protractile, and there appears to be only a sublingual gland; the surface of the
                    tongue is‘covered with velvety papillae in the terrestrial, with larger folds in
                    the marine Chelonians. In the Lacertilia the tongue presents a number of
                    variations which have been referred to as diagnostic characters of the various
                    families of Lizards <hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> The chief modifications are
                    the following: Either flat and broad, not protractile, <hi rend="italic"
                        >e.g.</hi> Agamidae; or the body of the tongue is somewhat cylindrical,
                    elongated, and the whole organ can be protruded; lastly, the anterior half of
                    the tongue, which can be protruded, is retractile or telescoped into the
                    posterior portion, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> Anguidae. Jn nearly all cases the
                    posterior dorsal end of the body of the tongue is well marked off by a margin
                    raised above the root, a character which does not occur in any snake. The upper
                    surface is either smooth or curved with velvety, flat, or scaly, always soft,
                    papillae. In the majority the tip of the tongue is bifid, either slightly niched
                    or deeply bifid. The tips contain tactile corpuscles, although sometimes covered
                    with a horny epithelium. The most specialized is the tongue of the chameleon.
                    -the body of this tongue is very thick, club-shaped, fleshy and full of large
                    mucous glands which cover it with a sticky secretion. The base or root is very
                    narrow, composed of extremely elastic fibres and supported by a much elongated
                    copular piece of the ' hyoid. This elastic part is, so to speak, telescoped over
                    the style-shaped copula, and the whole apparatus is kept in a contracted state
                    like a spring in a tube. A pair of wide blood vessels and elastic bands extend
                    from the base into the thick end, which in an ordinary chameleon can be shot out
                    to a distance of about 8 in.</p>
               <p>The tongue of the snakes is invariably slender, smooth and almost entirely
                    retractile into its posterior sheath-like portion. It is always bifid and
                    contains many tactile and other sensory corpuscles by which these creatures seem
                    to investigate. The tongue is always protruded during excitement. How this is
                    done is not very obvious, since the hyoid apparatus itself is much reduced.
                    There is a niche in the middle of the rostral shield to permit protrusion of the
                    tongue whilst the mouth is shut, and probably herewith is correlated the almost
                    universal absence of teeth in the premaxilla. The tongue and the larynx are
                    placed very far forwards in the mouth and, during the a,ct of swallowing, the
                    larynx approaches the chin, or it may even protrude out of the mouth to secure
                    breathing during the often painfully protracted act.</p>
               <p>Of <hi rend="italic">Glands,</hi> sublingual glands are of general occurrence in
                    reptiles; they open near the root or in the sheath of the tongue. Labial glands
                    seem to be absent in crocodiles and tortoises, but upper and low'er labial
                    glands exist in lizards and snakes, generally in considerable numbers. <hi
                        rend="italic">Heloderma</hi> is the only lizard in which some of these
                    glands—those along the lower jaw—produce a poisonous secretion, each small gland
                    conducting its secretion towards the base of one of the somewhat furrowed teeth.
                    In the snakes, upper and lower labial glands are well developed for salivation.
                    It is the upper series which attracts our interest by its eventual modification
                    into the deadly poison glands. Probably the saliva of most snakes, like their
                    serum, possesses toxic properties. In most of the harmless Colubrine snakes the
                    glands extend in a continuous series from behind the premaxilla along the whole
                    of the upper jaw, with numerous openings. In the Opisthogl^pha a gradual
                    differentiation takes place into an anterior, middle and posterior portion; the
                    middle, extending from below and behind the eye backwards, is the thickest and
                    yellowish in colour; behind it follows a small portion, reddish grey like the
                    anterior portion, with which it is more or less continuous below the middle
                    complex. Thus, still rather indifferent, is <hi rend="italic">Dryophis.</hi> In
                        <hi rend="italic">Dipsas, e.g. D. fusca,</hi> the middle portion has become
                    predominant; some of its enlarged ducts lead to the pair of posterior, enlarged
                    and well-grooved, maxillary teeth. It is this middIe portion which becomes the
                    characteristic poison gland with one long duct. The gland itself retains its
                    position; all the other upper labials, except the anterior series, abort. In the
                    Viperidae the poison duct opens near the base of the perforated fangs, which,
                    owing to the shortening of the anterior portion of the maxilla with its teeth,
                    have come to be the only teeth in the upper jaw. In the Elapine, still more in
                    the Hydrophine snakes, the position of the gland and its duct is the same, but
                    the duct has been carried past the smaller harmless teeth which stand in the
                    maxilla and open at the base of the anterior maxillary teeth. The effect is the
                    same, although the poison fangs are not homologous, in the one case the most
                    posterior, in the other the most anterior, of the maxillary series. In <hi
                        rend="italic">Doliophis,</hi> one of the Malay genera of Elapine snakes,
                    each poison gland sends an enormously elongated recess far into the body-cavity.
                    (For some other details see Snakes; Viper; and Rattlesnake. The best account of
                    the buccal glands and teeth of poisonous snakes is that by G. S. West, <hi

                        >Sphenodon</hi> the wide pharynx and oesophagus passes gradually into the
                    stomach, which is</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0167" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0190.jp2"/>
               <p>more or less spindle-shaped, never transversely placed. The walls of the stomach
                    are thrown into longitudinal folds which contain the specific gastric glands,
                    whilst glands are absent in the oesophagus, excepting scattered and very simple
                    slime glands. The circular muscular fibres of the stomach are much stronger than
                    the longitudinal fibres. The end of the stomach is generally marked by a pyloric
                    valve. The walls of the mid gut arc said to be devoid of glands. The end gut,
                    marked by a circular valve, is considerably wider and there is a caecum, mostly
                    left-sided, largest in leaf-eating lizards, rarely absent, as, for instance, in
                        <hi rend="italic">Anguis.</hi> The absorbent portion of the rectum is always
                    strongly marked off from the cloaca by a circular fold or sphincter, which
                    projects into the widened coprodaeum of the cloaca. In those lizards which, like
                        <hi rend="italic">Varanns,</hi> have no urinary bladder, there are two
                    successive sphincters, marking off two chambers, one, the upper or innermost,
                    for the reception of the faeces, the lower for that of the urine. In adult
                    crocodiles the stomach is transformed into a gizzard; it is more or less oval,
                    with a wide fundus and with two opposite apo-neurotic or tendinous disks whence
                    radiate the muscular fibres. The muscular walls remain, however, comparatively
                    thin, like those of birds of prey. There is a distinct pyloric stomach and then
                    follows the pylorus. The inner lining of the stomach is velvetlike with numerous
                    gastric glands which form groups with net-like interstices. There is a distinct
                    duodenal loop which contains the pancreas. The more convoluted mid gut is lined
                    with net-like meshes which farther back assume a longitudinal zigzag
                    arrangement; .towards the end gut the walls become quite smooth, but in the end
                    gut the walls again show a very narrow-meshed structure. None of these folds of
                    the mid and hind gut is said to contain digestive glands; they seem to be
                    entirely absorbent. The oesophagus of most tortoises shows longitudinal folds
                    with very numerous mucous glands. In the Chelonidac the pharynx and adjoining
                    part of the gullet are covered with little tubercles upon each of which opçns a
                    small gland. Farther down they give way to large, more or less conical papillae,
                    which assume a considerable size, point backwards, and are covered with a
                    somewhat homy epithelium. SimiliU conical, homy papillae exist also in <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphargis,</hi> in which the oesophagus, moreover, makes a long
                    loop half round the stomach before passing into it, an absolutely unique
                    feature. The transition into the stomach is quite gradual. The latter is
                    strongly muscular, partly transversely placed, and possesses often a very
                    distinct pyloric stomach. In <hi rend="italic">Chelone</hi> conical papillae
                    extend into the cardiac portion. In the majority of tortoises the inner lining
                    shows longitudinal folds with numerous small glands, mucous and gastric, but
                    their distribution differs much in the various families and even genera. The
                    Iming of the mid gut shows either longitudinal folds or a network, without
                    glands, except in some cases, Lieberkühn crypts, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in
                        <hi rend="italic">Trionyx,</hi> not in <hi rend="italic">Testudo</hi> and
                        <hi rend="italic">Chelone.</hi> The hind gut begins suddenly, but there is
                    no caecum; its inner walls contain numerous glands in <hi rend="italic">Testudo,
                        Emys,</hi> not in <hi rend="italic">Chelys, Trionyx, Cinosternum.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the snakes the oesophagus is very thin-walled and passes imperceptibly into
                    the stomach, which continues in a longitudinal direction, scarcely wider in the
                    middle. Its muscular coating is surprisingly weak. There is a small pyloric
                    portion. Mucous and especially long-bodied gastric glands are numerous. The wall
                    of the mid gut carries numerous papillae variably arranged, velvet-like, or
                    densely crowded little blades supported by longitudinal or by meshy folds. The
                    hind gut is short, often constricted into several successive chambers, mostly
                    smooth inside; there is a short, rather wide caecum which seems best developed
                    in Viperidae; sometimes absent. The total length of the snakes’ gut is always
                    short, there being only short folds possible or necessary in the body cavity,
                    which itself is of extraordinary length. Yet, while in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Typldops</hi> the gut is almost straight, it forms numerous convolutions in
                        <hi rend="italic">Tortrix.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whilst in all other reptiles the gut, at least stomach, liver and mid gut, are
                    suspended by the mesentery from the vertebral column and hang free into the body
                    cavity, in some snakes, especially often described in <hi rend="italic">Boa</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Python,</hi> the body cavity is cut up into numerous
                    spaces, by peritoneal folds which connect neighbouring twists of the canal into
                    bundles and attach them to the ventral surface of the body-wall. Probably the
                    gut is thereby secured against dislocations in adaptation to the peculiar
                    twisting contortions of the body, especially in the act of climbing. The
                    mesentery of reptiles is remarkable for the possession of smooth, non-striated,
                    muscular fibres. In most lizards, not in other orders, the peritoneum so far as
                    it covers the abdominal cavity shows a deep black pigmentation; this pigment is
                    situated in the connective tissue, not in the epithelial layer; it stops
                    suddenly towards the thorax. In some lizards, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in <hi
                        rend="italic">Anguis,</hi> the black pigment extends, more or less
                    scattered, upon the mesentery and thence upon the intestines. The same pigment
                    colours the pharynx with its recesses entirely black in many lizards. There is
                    no compensating correlation between this internal pigment and that in the outer
                    skin.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Liver</hi> of lizards is more or less bilobed; more so in
                    crocodiles; while in tortoises the broad right and left lobes are connected by a
                    narrow isthmus. In the snakes it is much elongated and extends from the heart
                    backwards along the right side of the oesophagus, closely connected in its long
                    course with numerous short branches into, or from, the inferior vena cava and
                    the portal vein. A gall bladder is always present. The ducts into and from the
                    cyst sometimes form a complicated network, for instance in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Varanus</hi> (F. E. Beddard); the bile is carried by one or more ducts into
                    the duodenal portion of the mid gut. The microscopic structure of the reptilian
                    liver has been compared with that of monotremes by M. Fürbringer.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Pancreas</hi> is a compact body attached to the duodenal
                    region, which surrounds it by a loop ri the crocodiles, as is the case in birds
                    and mammals.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Cloaca</hi> of the reptiles shows a great advance upon the
                    simple batrachian arrangement. ■ It is no longer one common chamber, but
                    consists of three successive chambers with the further tendency of separating
                    the temporary retention and the passage of the faecal, urinary and genital
                    products from each other. The arrangement is simplest and most typical in the
                    lizards. There is first the <hi rend="italic">proclodaeum</hi> or vestibulum of
                    the cloaca, epiblastic in origin. ' Its outer boundary is formed by the cloacal
                    lips, covered so far by the usual scaly integument. Just within this chamber
                    arise the paired copulatory organs, and, when they are present, as in <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphcnodon</hi> and snakes, the two anal glands. Secondly, the
                        <hi rend="italic">urodaeum,</hi> middle or urino-genital chamber,
                    hypoblastic in origin. It is separated from the proctodaeum by a more or less
                    circular fold which is provided with sphincter muscles, which form the true
                    vent, and this is always round; whilst the outermost opening in lizards and
                    snakes is a transverse slit. Farther inwards, headwards, the urodaeum is shut
                    off by another circular fold, generally very well marked, especially in its
                    dorsal half, which is higher and . thicker. Into the dorsal, and innermost,
                    recess of this urodaeum open the genital and urinary ducts; on the ventral side
                    arises the urinary bladder. The whole chamber is always empty, being only a
                    passage room, and in the female the copulatory chamber. The urine is of course
                    collected in the bladder; when this is absent the fluid is pressed into the
                    third chamber, the <hi rend="italic">coprodaeum,</hi> which is often subdivided
                    into two, or even three, successive rooms by circular folds. This coprodaeum
                    serves for the temporary storage of the faeces, eventually mixed with the urine.
                    Micturition and defaecation are in most lizards two successive separate acts.</p>
               <p>The snake’s arrangement is a side-departure of that prevailing in lizards. The
                    urodaeum is transformed into a dorsal recess into which open above the oviducts,
                    while the ureters open below, in the caudal comer. A horizontal fold imperfectly
                    shuts off the wide urino-genital chamber or recess from the ventral half of the
                    original urodaeum. The coprodaeum is marked above and below by strong
                    sphincters. There is no urinary bladder.</p>
               <p>In crocodiles the protodaeum is rather shallow, but long; from its ventral wall

               <p>half of the uro-proctodaeal fold, near which open the male ducts. Very young
                    crocodiles possess a typical middle chamber or urodaeum, into the dorso-lateral
                    corners of which open the ureters, but soon the strong circular fold between
                    urodaeum and coprodaeum disappears completely, so that both chambers now form
                    one large oval room, which is used solely for the storage of the urine, there
                    being no bladder. The faeces are kept in the not specially dilated rectum.</p>
               <p>The cloacal arrangement of the Chelonia is a further development of early
                    crocodilian conditions, but it has become rather complicated and shows a
                    surprising resemblance to that which still prevails in the Monotremes. The
                    proctodaeum is deep and very long, especially in the males. From its innermost
                    and ventral walls arises the large copulatory organ. From the urodaeum is
                    separated off a deep ventral recess into which open the ureters and the genital
                    ducts, and it is continued by a long neck into the large bladder. Between the
                    dorsal wall of this recess and the ventral wall of the main portion of the
                    urodaeum arises a horizontal fold which, diverging, is continued on to the
                    investing skin of the penis, helping to form the edges of the deep longitudinal
                    furrow on its morphologically dorsal surface. If the lips of this furrow were
                    closed, urine and all the genital products would pass through this urethral
                    canal, but in reality only the semen is conducted through it (the furrow during
                    the state of turgescence being transformed into a closed tube), whilst urine and
                    eggs escape through the wide slit near its inner end. This is an arrangement
                    almost the same as that of <hi rend="italic">Orniihorhynchus.</hi> The urodaeum
                    is separated from the rectum by a strong sphincter, and there is, as in the
                    crocodiles and mammals, no special coprodaeum. The Chelonian urodaeum is further
                    complicated by the occurrence of a pair of large anal sacs, thin-walled
                    diverticula on the dorsal side. Such sacs, not to be confounded with the anal
                    glands of other reptiles, exist in many water tortoises, especially in the
                    Chelydidae, also in various aquatic Testudinidae, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Emys <hi rend="sub">t</hi></hi> in <hi rend="italic">Platyslernum,</hi> and sometimes in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Trionyx*,</hi> they are absent in the Chelonidae and in the typically
                    terrestrial tortoises. These sacs have highly vascularized walls and a
                    considerable layer of circular and longitudinal non-striped muscular'fibres;
                    their inside is sometimes villous, never glandular. They are incessantly filled
                    and emptied with water through the vent, and act as additional respiratory
                    organs, like a kind of water lungs. When such a tortoise is suddenly taken out
                    of the water it squirts out a stream of water, which is not, as is usually
                    supposed, the urine from the bladder.</p>
               <p>In connexion with the cloaca may be mentioned the frequent occurrence of <hi
                        rend="italic">peritoneal</hi> canals. In the tortoises their abdominal
                    openings are situated in a recess of the peritoneal cavity close to either side
                    of the neck of the bladder; in the females they extend as funnels, generally
                    blind, into the cloaca on or near the base of the clitoris. In the males they
                    extend, without having communication with the cavities of the corpora cavernosa,
                    and without ramifications, as canals along the dorsum penis and <hi
                        rend="italic">either</hi> terminate blindly in the glans <hi rend="italic"
                        >(Testudo, Chelone), or</hi> they open, each by a small orifice, in the
                    groove at the base of the glans. In crocodiles these canals are short and open
                    near the base of the copulatory organ, protected by a small papilla. They are
                    present in both sexes, but are still closed in newly hatched and very immature
                    specimens. In an adult Nile crocodile they are wide enough to pass an ordinary
                    lead pencil. The function of these outlets from the body cavity is obscure. In
                        <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> the writer has found them as closed funnels
                    which project as soft papillae into the proctodaeum a little to the right and
                    left and Caudalwards from the urino-genital papillae.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Urinary Organs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">kidneys</hi> of the reptiles show, like those of the birds
                    and mammals, a considerable advance upon those of the Batrachia. They are, in
                    the adult, represented entirely by the metanephros; the segmental tubes have no
                    longer any nephro-stomes opening into the body cavity, not even during any time
                    of their development, and it has come to a complete separation of the efferent
                    genital ducts from the kidneys and from their ureters. Yet these differences are
                    but of degree, there being a continuous bridge from Batrachian to Lacer-tilian
                    conditions. In <hi rend="italic">Lacerta,</hi> for instance, in which these
                    features have been studied most thoroughly, the mesonephros continues as the
                    only functional excretory organ during the first year of the yöung creature
                    until and during its first hibernation, when the formation of the metanephros
                    takes place, and with it the complete separation of the vasa deferentia from
                    tlie kidneys. Until then the segmental canals remain in the male as common
                    carriers of semen and urine, at least morphologically, not physiologically,
                    since in the immature there is no occasion for the conduction of semen. The
                    kidneys of these young lizards show precisely the same arrangement as that of
                    the Batrachia, excluding the Discoglossidae.</p>
               <p>Clearly the metanephros is developed from, and is part of, the posterior portion
                    of the mesonephros, the glomeruli of which no longer open into the segmental
                    duct, but become connected with a new canal, the future ureter, which sprouts
                    from the distal portion of the segmental duct and grows headwards. Or let us put
                    these important changes in another way. Since there are originally several
                    segmental ducts (permanent in the male, newt) which tailwards more and more lose
                    their connexion with the testes, until—in the posterior portion of the
                    mesonephros— they become entirely urinary ducts, the hindmost of these sprouts
                    (in lizards postembryonic, much earlier in birds and mammals) independently, but
                    at the same time as the neighbouring mass of the mesonephros, the growing
                    glomeruli of which then connect with the sprouting processes of the ureter.
                    Phylogenetically and OntogeneticalIy it is evident enough that the kidneys are
                    essentially one organ, the anterior portion of which is the oldest and decays,
                    whilst farther backwards new and more differentiated portions continue to grow.
                    Pro-, meso-and metanephros and successive wave-like stagey of the same organ
                    with morphological and functional continuity, until the next, improved portion
                    is ready. It is important that in the Discoglossidae, especially in the male <hi
                        rend="italic">Alytes,</hi> an arrangement has come to pass which much
                    resembles that of the Amniota. The mesonephros has, by a simple contrivance,
                    become a metanephros, provided we define the former as a kidney which is still
                    connected with true segmental ducts.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">suprarenal bodies,</hi> adrenals, head-kidneys or
                    Nebennieren, are yellowish bodies which lie more in connexion with the
                    generative glands than with the kidneys, always closely attached to the vena
                    cava posterior just above the kidneys. They are very elongated in the snakes, in
                    a io-foot python they measure about one inch in length; they are flattened in
                    tortoises, roundish in crocodiles.</p>
               <p>In all reptiles the kidneys are retroperitoneal, and they do not project into
                    the body cavity. Their position is different in the various groups, and their
                    general shape is much affected by the shape of the body. In the <hi
                        rend="italic">Ophidia</hi> they are much elongated, and of course far in
                    front of the pelvic region, which has been moved to the cloaca. They are placed
                    asymmetrically, the right extending farthest forwards. They consist of many
                    transverse lobes, sometimes in such a way as to appear spirally twisted. Each
                    terminates considerably in front of the cloaca. Each ureter begins at the
                    anterior end of the kidney, and thence proceeds on its inner and dorsal border,
                    receiving ducts from the interspaces of the numerous lobes. In the male each
                    ureter opens upon a papilla, together with the vas deferens; in the female the
                    ureter is joined by a blind canal, the vestige of the male duct. No snake has a
                    urinary bladder. The urinary excretion is white, chalky, consisting mainly of
                    uric acid in crystals, with very little fluid.</p>
               <p>In the <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia</hi> the kidneys are more posteriorly placed
                    than in snakes. They lie between the pelvis and the cloaca and are generally
                    close together, sometimes partly fused with each other. Only in the
                    Amphisbaenids the right kidney extends more forwards. They are usually
                    transversely furrowed. The ureters open dorso-iaterally into the urodaeum upon
                    papillae as in the snakes. In the females the remnants of the segmental</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0169" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0192.jp2"/>
               <p>ducts, or vestigial representatives of the vasa efferentia, are often of
                    considerable length, persistent in chameleon and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Uromastix,</hi> much reduced in geckos, or disappearing with age as in <hi
                        rend="italic">Lacerta.</hi> The urine of most lizards contains much solid
                    uric acid, which is retained in the urodaeum and voided as a rather solid, white
                    mass, not united with the faeces. Those which have a greater amount of fluid
                    urine have a bladder which receives the fluid portion. The opening of this
                    bladder is on the ventral side of the cloaca, not in direct connexion with the
                    ureters. The bladder is very rarely absent, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> in
                    Varanidae and Amphisbaenidae.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia</hi> have the kidneys placed below the pelvis;
                    their surface shows meandering convolutions separated by furrows. The ureters
                    are for the greater part of their length deeply sunk into the substance of the
                    kidneys, which they leave near the hinder ends, to run freely for a short
                    distance along the dorsal sides of the cloaca, and they open, each separately,
                    and away from the vasa deferentia, into the dorsal side of the urodaeum, which,
                    together with the coprodaeum, forms a large oval chamber, and this being filled
                    with the very fluid urine, functionizes instead of the absent bladder.</p>
               <p>In <hi rend="italic">Chelonia</hi> the kidneys lie in the pelvis, short and
                    thick, more or less trihedral; the surface is marked with many shallow
                    meandering grooves and fewer deeper furrows. Each ureter, composed of several
                    large successive canals, leaves its kidney near the inner hinder end, and then
                    runs free for a short space, crossing the gut to open into the neck of the
                    urinary bladder, which arises ventrally out of the urodaeum, which itself has
                    become a recess of the cloaca. The bladder is large, often more or less
                    two-horned, attached to the pelvic wall by a peritoneal fold, and it contains
                    very fluid urine.</p>
               <p>The kidneys of <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> are very small and far removed
                    from the generative organs. The ureters open, each close to the vas deferens of
                    its side, beneath a little papilla, on the dorsal side, rather near the midline
                    of the urodaeum, whence arises a long-necked bladder.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Reproductive System.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Ovaries</hi> are always in pairs, placed headwards at a
                    distance from the kidneys in <hi rend="italic">Sphenadon,</hi> lizards and
                    snakes; in the latter the right ovary lies farther forward. In tortoises, and
                    especially in the crocodiles, where they arc very long and much twisted or
                    Iobated, they are situated close to the kidneys and even accompany them. The
                    ovaries of lizards and snakes contain many and large lymph spaces; those of the
                    other reptiles are much denser in structure. The ripening eggs always cause them
                    to assume the shape of a bunch of grapes. The <hi rend="italic">oviducts</hi>
                    are each held by a peritoneal fold which arises from near the dorsal midline.
                    The abdominal ostia are long slits and are turned towards the side, away from
                    the ovaries. The walls of the ducts gradually become thicker, glandular and much
                    folded. Whilst the ripe eggs, often in considerable numbers, receive their
                    shell, each egg lies in a separate chamber; in the geckos, which lay only one
                    pair of eggs, the two respective chambers have become permanent features. In <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> each oviduct opens together with the ureter of
                    its side near the dorsomedian line of the urodaeum. In most lizards the two
                    oviducts and the two ureters have four separate openings in the dorsal wall of
                    the rather deep dorsal recess of the urodaeum. But in <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lophura</hi> both oviducts unite (like the ureters) and have only one
                    opening, which is placed a little nearer towards the pelvis than the urinary
                    opening, but they are divided by a longitudinal septum which extends almost to
                    their common orifice. In the snakes the oviducts likewise open into the dorsal
                    recess, sometimes by a common ostium, which is provided with a strong sphincter.
                    The whole recess acts like a vagina for the reception of one of-the copulatory
                    organs. The oviducts of the crocodiles open in a decidedly ventral position, on
                    either side close to the base of the clitoris, a considerable distance from the
                    openings of the ureters. In the tortoises the oviducts open separately into a
                    wide ventral urino-genital sinus, at the base of the neck of the bladder.</p>
               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Testes</hi> correspond in position with the ovaries; in
                    snakes and Amphisbaenids the right is placed farther headwards than the left.
                    The usual shape is elongated, sometimes pointed forwards. The <hi rend="italic"
                        >Epididymis</hi> is sometimes of the same size as the testis and then
                    consists of many meandering convolutions of the vas defercns which is composed
                    of several canals from the testis. The convolutions are held together by a
                    peritoneal lamella. Towards the cloaca they become much smaller and shorter, and
                    the vas deferens passes along the median side of the ureter. In <hi
                        rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> these open separately, each near and below the
                    same papilla near which opens the ureter of the same side. In most lizards the
                    vas deferens unites with its ureter into one short canal which opens beneath or
                    upon a small papilla in the upper corner of the urodaeal recess, far away from
                    the penis. In snakes vas deferens and ureter of each side are likewise commonly
                    united. In the crocodiles each vas dcferens passes from the dorsal side of the
                    cloaca to the ventral side, not accompanied by the ureter, and opens into the
                    blind sac which forms the basal continuation of the deep groove on the dorsal
                    side of the penis. In the tortoises the epididymis is very large and the vas
                    deferens is also much convoluted; each opens separately near the neck of the
                    large urinary bladder close to the backward continuation of the deep
                    longitudinal groove of the copulatory organ.</p>
               <p>Remnants of the Mullerian ducts run paralleI with the vasa deferentia, and
                    similar remnants of the Wolffian ducts accompany the oviducts in crocodiles and
                    tortoises, least degenerated of course in young specimens. Such reciprocal
                    vestiges occur most likely also in lizards, and in female snakes a.vestige of
                    the male duct joins its ureter. In a nearly adult male <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphenodon</hi> the present writer missed the female remnants.</p>
               <p>The copulatory organs show’ very important modifications. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphenodon</hi> is the only recent reptile which is devoid of such an organ;
                    its imperfect substitute is an unpaired, thin, but high membranous fold which
                    arises from the dorsal middle of the circular fold between urodaeum and
                    coprodaeum. During copulation this part of the cloaca is probably everted to
                    secure conception, a striking resemblance to the arrangement found in the
                    Caecilia. The organs of all lizards and snakes are paired, in their quiescent
                    state withdrawn into deep pockets which open on the right and left posterior
                    comers of the proctodaeum or outer chamber of the</p>
               <p>cloaca, which for this reason</p>
               <p>has assumed the shape of</p>
               <p>a transverse slit in all</p>
               <p>lizards and snakes. Hence</p>
               <p>these have sometimes been</p>
               <p>called <hi rend="italic">Plagiotremota.</hi> Each</p>
               <p>organ can be everted and</p>
               <p>tucked in like the finger</p>
               <p>of a glove, a muscle being</p>

               <p>the apex; when everted, the</p>
               <p>muscle extends through the</p>
               <p>length of the organ; each</p>

               <p>verse processes of the tail</p>
               <p>vertebrae, at a consider</p>
               <p>able distance from the</p>
               <p>cloaca. In the embryo each</p>
               <p>organ arises as a conical protuberance, or papilla, which projects out of the
                    vent. Later it becomes inverted. Probably this ontogenetic feature recapitulates
                    the phylogeny of these organs, which have to be looked upon as swelling flaps or
                    portions of the walls of the cloaca which were protruded during copulation, and
                    which in time borrowed, and specialized, muscular fibres from the ventral tail
                    muscles. On the outer everted side of each organ is a furrow for the reception
                    of the semen. The apex is either single or more or lcss deeply bifurcated, each
                    arm being followed by the likewise divided furrow.. The outer investing membrane
                    of these.very muscular erectile bodies is epidermal; often, especially in
                    snakes, provided with numerous papillae, folds or other excrescences. In</p>

               <p>many snakes these are spiny and hard, but according to Leydig this hardness is
                    not due to a horny substance but to the deposition of calcifying matter. E. D.
                    Cope has investigated the almost endless minor modifications of these penial
                    features and uses them for taxonomic purposes in the snakes. Vestiges of these
                    organs occur in females of snakes and lizards. Close to these organs of the
                    snakes lies a pair of anal glands of some size, which pour their very offensive
                    secretion through an opening close to the base’ of each penis. The same glands
                    occur in the same position in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon,</hi> which has no
                    copulatory organs, and in crocodiles they appear as evertible musk glands. Hence
                    J. E. V; Boas, not knowing of their existence in both sexes of snakes, tried to
                    homologize them with the paired penes of reptiles, an error which has been
                    repeated in C. Gegenbauris <hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch,</hi> vol. ii. p. 533.</p>
               <p>The crocodiles and tortoises possess a single, median copulatory organ ; it lies
                    on the ventral or anterior end of the cloaca, the outer opening of which is
                    therefore a longitudinal slit, hence the term <hi rend="italic"
                        >Ucthotremala.</hi> In the crocodiles the organ is attached to the caudal
                    corner of the ischiadic symphysis by a strong and roundish fibrous band, which
                    arises single from the ventral sides and forms partly the continuation of the
                    two fibrous halves of the organ; the bulk of the crura, comparable to corpora
                    cavernosa, is not attached to the pelvis, as generally stated, but projects
                    backwards towards and into the pelvic cavity. This portion is especially rich in
                    venous Cavernosities. The outer coating of the glans possesses various papillary
                    projections, which are furnished with sensory, hedonic corpuscles. On the
                    morphologically dorsal side of the organ, not on the dorsum penis, is a deep
                    groove which ends towards the crura in a blind sac, into the farther corner of
                    which open the vasa deferentia. In a full-grown Nile crocodile the whole organ
                    is about 10 in. long. In young females up to a total length of 3 or 4 ft. the
                    clitoris is nearly of the same size as the male organ, but it remains stationary
                    and appears very small in large specimens.</p>
               <p>The organ of the tortoises is essentially of the same type as that of the
                    crocodiles, but it is nowhere directly attached to the pelvis or to any other
                    skeletal part. The whole organ, when withdrawn, lies in a ventral, long recess
                    of the wide outer cloacal chamber, and its crura extend so far back as to form
                    the continuation of the ventral and lateral walls of the recessus which is
                    continued into the neck of the urinary bladder. Its orifice and those of the
                    seminal ducts are enclosed by the walls of the deep groove which runs along the
                    underside of the organ. This is always of considerable size, surprisingly large
                    in <hi rend="italic">Trionyx.</hi> The clitoris is small, sometimes tiny.</p>
               <p>The sexual act is extremely prolonged in Chelonians and StilI more so are the
                    preliminaries, but in crocodiles it is the deed of a few seconds. Lizards and
                    snakes insert only one side.</p>
               <p>There remains the question whether the unpaired organ of the crocodiles and
                    tortoises, which is the prototype of the mammalian organ in every essential
                    point, and the paired organs of the lizards and snakes, are to a certain extent
                    homologous organs in so far as they can both be derived from the same
                    indifferent condition. With this view we assume that originally the protrusihle
                    walls of the outer cloacal chamber became specialized into a right and left
                    imperfect intromittent organ, that subsequently, in lizards, those hemipenes
                    were shifted back towards the tail and were henceforth bound to develop
                    separately, while <hi rend="sub">(</hi> in the crocodiles, tortoises, mammals
                    and birds the two primitive lateral evertile flaps approached each other towards
                    the ventral anterior side of the cloaca, and that this led to a fusion,
                    beginning probably at the basal part, which at the same time was farther
                    withdrawn from the surface and secured the reception of the sperma from both
                    vasa deferentia into one canal. This hypothesis * has been objected to by Boas,
                    but accepted by Gegenbaur (p. 538) after having been rejected on p. 533 of his

               <p>The <hi rend="italic">Fat bodies</hi> belong at least physiologically to the
                    generative system. They are placed outside the peritonéum. In lizards they
                    appear as two masses in the pelvic region, the black peritoneal lining covering
                    only their dorsal side. They consist of a network of arteries and connective
                    tissue, the meshy spaces of which are filled with “ fat ”; they each receive an
                    artery from the femoral vessel which enters them in the inguinal region; the
                    veins collect into the abdominal. In snakes the fat bodies are very long,
                    extending from the cloaca to the liver. Tortoises seem to have only traces of
                    them, but in <hi rend="italic">Sphenodon</hi> and in crocodiles they resemble
                    those of lizards.— The peculiar organ suspended from the right abdominal wall of
                    crocodiles, variously mentioned as mesenteric gland or body, or fatty spleen, by
                    Butler, is possibly related to the same category. The fat bodies of reptiles are
                    sometimes vaguely alluded to,as hibernating bodies; like the fat bodies which
                    are attached to the generative glands of Amphibia they do not become reduced
                    during the eventual hibernation but are largest before the pairing season, by
                    the end of which they are exhausted, looking reddish or grey after the loss of
                    their stores of fat and probably other important contents</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">The Embryonic Development.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fertilization of the egg always takes place internally, and the egg containing a
                    large amount of food-yolk is of course meroblastic. It is sufficient to mention
                    that many lizards, some chameleons and many snakes (not <hi rend="italic"
                        >Sphenodon,</hi> geckos, crocodiles and Chelonians) retain their, in these
                    cases very thin-shelled, eggs in the oviducts until the embryo is ’ready to
                    burst the egg-membrane during the act of parturition or immediately after it.
                    Such species are usually called ovo-viviparous, although there is no difference
                    between them and other viviparous creatures, for instance the marsupials. The
                    majority of reptiles are oviparous and the egg is enclosed in a strong parchment
                    shell, with or without calcareous deposits. Only gas exchange can take place
                    between such an egg and the outside, and it loses by evaporation, whilst in the
                    batrachian egg various other exchanges are easy through the thin membrane. The
                    salamander embryo, within its thin egg-membrane, even grows to a size many times
                    larger than the original egg, it does not only breathe, but it is also nourished
                    through the gills, and by some means or other the waste products are partly
                    eliminated without filling the bladder. The amphibia are born as larvae and live
                    as such for a long time, often in a most imperfect condition. Nothing of all
                    this applies to the reptile, which leaves the egg as a perfect little imago. A
                    great amount of yolk supplying the material, and a large “ bladder ” to receive
                    the waste products and to act as respiratory organ, have made this possible.
                    That the allantois and the amnion behave precisely in the same way in the
                    mammals with their much reduced yolk, only testifies to the superior value of
                    these organs, and after all there is no difference in this respect between a
                    monotreme and a reptile. These two organs seem to have come into existence with
                    the reptiles and constitute the most reliable diagnostic feature between higher
                    and lower vertebrates. All reptiles, birds and mammals have a navel, a feature
                    unknown and impossible in Batrachia and fishes. A few remarks on these important
                    embryonic organs may not be superfluous, especially concerning their possible
                    origin.</p>
               <p>Whilst the urinary bladder of the Batrachia remains within the body throughout
                    the embryonic stage, this organ undergoes in the higher vertebrates, reptiles,
                    birds and mammals, considerable modifications, and it assumes, henceforth as <hi
                        rend="italic">Allantois,</hi> new important functions besides that of being
                    the receptacle of the embryonic urine. The development of the AUantois is in
                    -intimate causal connexion with that of the <hi rend="italic">Amnion.</hi> All
                    the <hi rend="italic">Allantoidea</hi> are also <hi rend="italic">Amniota</hi>
                    and vice versa, but the term Amniota is preferable, since the basal portion of
                    the AUantois remains in the adult as the urinary bladder, as an organ henceforth
                    equivalent to and homologous with that of the Anamnia. The primary feature seems
                    to be the allantois which leaves the body cavity, remains without the amniotic
                    folds, even after these have enclosed the body within the amniotic bag, and</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0171" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0194.jp2"/>
               <p>then spreads nearly all over the.inner side of the egg-shell. Having thus come
                    into the closest possible contact with the atmospheric air, the vessels of the
                    allantois can exchange their carbon dioxide for oxygen and the allantois becomes
                    the respiratory organ of the embryo. Herewith stands in direct correlation the
                    complete absence of any internal and of external gills in the embryonic
                    reptiles. The blood vessels of the allantois are fundamentally the same as those
                    of the batrachian bladder, namely, branches from the pelvic arteries (later
                    hypogastrics) and veins which return from the base of the bladder to the
                    abdominal wall and thence to the liver.</p>
               <p>In the normal reptilian egg, surrounded by its non-yielding shell, space is
                    absolutely limited, and whilst the yolk is being diminished and increased
                    secretion of urine distends the bladder, this soon protrudes out of the body
                    cavity proper into the extra-embryonal coelomatic space between the true amnion
                    and the false amnion or serous membrane. It fills this space so far as the
                    yolk-sac allows it. It seems reasonable to suppose that this growth of the
                    allantois has been one of the causes of the caudal amniotic fold; the sinking of
                    the embryo into the space of the diminishing yolk-sac is no doubt another cause,
                    but the fact remains that the amnion is the chief hindrance to the closing of
                    the body-wall at the region of the future navel.</p>
               <p>The life-histories of embryonic development are the domain of the
                    embryographers. They are the imperfect accounts of the ways and means (often
                    crooked and blurred, owing to short cuts and in adaptation to conditions which
                    prevail during the embryonic period) by which the growing creature arrives at
                    those features which form the account of the anatomical structure of the adult.
                    Comparative anatomy, with physiology, alone lead through the maze of the endless
                    embryonic vagaries and afford the clues for the reconstruction of the real
                    life-history of an animal and its ancestry. For detail the reader is referred to

               <p>IV. Distribution in Space</p>
               <p>This zoo-geographical review deals only with modern reptiles. We begin with a
                    survey of the faunas of some of the most obvious land-complexes which bear close
                    resemblance to the now classical “ regions ” of P. L. Sclater and A. R. Wallace.
                    None of these “ regions ” has definable frontiers, and what acts as a bar to one
                    family may be totally ignored by another. According to the several orders of
                    reptiles the world is mapped out in very different ways. The African fauna does
                    not stop at the Suez Canal, nor even at the Red Sea; there is a transitional
                    belt noticeable in the countries from Syria to Arabia, Persia and India. To the
                    north, Indian influence extends right into Turkestan, or vice versa; the
                    CentralAsiatic fauna passes into that of India. On the Chinese side prevailing
                    conditions are still almost unknown; Wallace’s line is more or less rigidly
                    respected by Trionychidae, hooded <hi rend="italic">Elaps,</hi> vipers and
                    Lacertidae, while it has not the slightest influence upon crocodiles, pit
                    vipers, Varanidae, Agamidae, &amp;c. In the western hemisphere we have a
                    grand illustration of the interchange of two faunas and of the fact that it is
                    neither a narrow strait nor an equally narrow isthmus which decides the
                    limitation of two regions. Central America and the Antilles form one complex
                    with S. America. The nearctic region ends at the edge of the great Mexican
                    plateau, which itself is a continuation of the north continent. Many nearctic
                    forms have passed southwards into the tropics, even into far-off S. America, but
                    the majority of the southerners, in their northern extension, have been checked
                    by this plateau and have surged to the right and left along the Pacific and
                    Atlantic tropical coastlands. The present writer happens to have made a special
                    study of this part of tbe world (cf. “ The Distribution of Mexican Amphibians
                    and Reptiles,” <hi rend="italic">P.Z.S.,</hi> 1905, pp. 191-294); the N. and S.
                    American faunas have therefore been more fully treated in the following review
                    of the various faunas. No doubt others can be treated in a similar manner, but
                    the physical features between N. and S. America are unique, and the results are
                    closely paralleled by those' of the fauna of birds. The narrow <hi rend="sup"
                        >7</hi> and long neck of the isthmus of Panama (once no doubt much broader)

                    Varanidae, .with the addition of a small family which is peculiar to the region,
                    the Pygopodidae. A peculiar type, <hi rend="italic">Dibamus,</hi> inhabits the
                    borderlands, namely, New Guinea, the Moluccas, Celebes and the Nicobar Islands;
                    and, finally, a single iguanoid, <hi rend="italic">Brachylophus,</hi> is common
                    in the Fiji Islands; how it came there, or how it survived its severance from
                    the American stock, is a mystery. The skinks are in this region more highly
                    developed and more specialized than in any other part of the world ; they exceed
                    in numbers the geckos, which generally accompany the skinks in their range over
                    the smaller islands of the Pacific; in these islands members of these two
                    families represent the whole of the Lacertilian fauna. The Australian agamoids
                    are chiefly peculiar and partly much 'differentiated forms <hi rend="italic"
                        >(e.g. Moloch</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Chlamy-dosaurus),</hi> but some
                    have distinct affinities to, or are even identical with, Indian genera. The
                    Varanidae are also closely allied to Indian species.</p>
               <p>Of snakes, amounting to about one hundred species only, we note about one dozen
                    Typhlopidae, and of Pythoninae simply <hi rend="italic">Python,</hi> and the
                    Boine <hi rend="italic">Enygrus</hi> on the islands from New Guinea to Fiji.
                    There arc but surprisingly few innocuous colubrine snakes, scarcely a dozen, and
                    all belonging to Indian genera. The bulk of the snakes belong to the poisonous
                    Elapinae, all of genera peculiar to the region, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
                        Acanthophis, Pseudechis, Notechis.</hi> Such a preponderance of poisonous
                    over harmless snakes is found nowhere else in the world. Tasmania is tenanted by
                    poisonous snakes only. In Australia we meet, therefore, with ‘the interesting
                    fact that, whilst it is closély allied to S. America, but totally distinct from
                    India by its Chelonians, its lizards and colubrine snakes connect it with this
                    latter region. With regard to the other Ophidians, they have their nearest
                    allies partly in India, partly in Madagascar, partly in S. America; and the
                    character of the Australian snake fauna consists chiefly in its peculiar
                    composition, differing thereby more from the other equatorial regions than those
                    do among themselves. Wallace’s line marks the boundary between India and
                    Australia only as far as Chelonians are concerned, but it is quite effaced by
                    the distribution of lizards and snakes. Thus in New Guinea lizards of the Indian
                    region are mixed with Pygopodidae, and an island as far E. as TimorIaut is
                    inhabited by snakes, some of which are peculiarly Indian, whilst the others are
                    as decidedly Australian. The islands N. of New Guinea and of Melanesia are not
                    yet occupied by the Ophidian type, and only species of <hi rend="italic"
                        >Enygrus</hi> have penetrated eastwards as far as the Low Archipelago,
                    whilst the Fiji Islands and the larger islands of Melanesia have sufficiently
                    long been raised above the level of the sea to develop quite peculiar genera of
                    snakes.</p>

                    this type is to be considered rather an immigrant from its. present

                    but without giving a characteristic feature to the region by special
                    modification of the leading forms except the gecko <hi rend="italic">Ptychozoon
                        homalocephalum</hi> in Malaya. The Lacertidae are represented by one

                    generally distributed types, have retained respectively two species in W. India,
                    and one in the Khasi Hills, whilst the presence of a single species of chameleon
                    in S. India and Ceylon reminds us again of the relations of this part of the

                    genial climes, in Africa and India. Fossils, none too numerous, tell us that it
                    was not always thus, since crocodiles, alligators and long-snouted gavials, all
                    the main groups of chelo-nians, iguanoids, &amp;c., existed in England,.the
                    Crocodilians persisting even towards the end of the Tertiary period.</p>
               <p>There are no crocodiles now in the Eurasian sub-region, excepting small
                    survivors in the Jordan basin, on the borderland of Africa; but the

                    to African than to lndian forms, just as we should expect from the prevailing
                    geographical conditions. If it were not for the N.W. corner of Africa ana

                    probably also the Iguanidae, although they have found a congenial home in the S.
                    countries, where they are now represented by an abundance of genera and species,

                    development of boas and anacondas in the S. ; certainly Crotalinae, of which
                    only one species, C. <hi rend="italic">terrificus,</hi> is found in S. America;
                    further, some aglyphous colubrines, which have sent a few species only into

               <p>After these numerous restrictions we should expect the genuine autochthonous

                    and S. America have no Triony-chidae. The oldest S. American reptilian fauna is
                    composed as follows. It is the only part of the world which possesses Chelydidae
                    in abundance, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Chelys</hi> the

                        rend="italic">Podocnemis,</hi> which re-occurs in Madagascar. Cro-codilia
                    are represented by <hi rend="italic">Crocodilus americanus</hi> and C. <hi

                    N.W. of the continent, more numerous in Central America and the Antilles. The
                    Tejidae are clearly a neotropical family, with several dozen genera in S.
                    America; ot all thèse, only <hi rend="italic">Ameiva</hi> and the closely allied
                        <hi rend="italic">Cnemidophorus</hi> extend through and beyond Central
                    America: <hi rend="italic">Ameiva</hi> into the E. and W. hot lands of Mexico
                    and into the Antilles, <hi rend="italic">Cnemidophorus</hi> through Mexico far
                    into most of the United States with a few species. Of snakes there is an
                    abundance. Typhlopidae and GIauconiidae are well represented. Of aglyphous
                    colubrines many genera, some of these extending northwards into Mexico, but not
                    to the Antilles, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Atractes, Tropidodipsas, Dirosema,
                        Geaphis, Xenodon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Opisthoglypha are very numerous in genera and species both in S. and Central
                    America <hi rend="sub">t</hi> Whencemany of the arboreal forms extend into the
                    hot countries of Mexico, while a few terrestrials have spread over the plateau
                    and thence into the United States, none entering the Antilles; such typical
                    neotropical genera are <hi rend="italic">Himan-todes, Leptodira, Oxyrhopus,
                        Erythrolamprus, Conophis, Scolecophis, Homalocranium, Petalognathus,
                        Leptognathus.</hi> Most of the Ambly-cephalidae are neotropical, the others
                    in S.E. Asia. Of Elapinae only the genus <hi rend="italic">Elaps</hi> occurs,
                    but with many species. Of the Cro-talinae, <hi rend="italic">Lachesis</hi> is
                    the essentially neotropical genus, with many species, some of which enter the
                    hot Iandsof Mexico, <hi rend="italic">e.g. L. lansbergi s. lanceolatus,</hi> a
                    very widely distributed species, the only pit viper which has entered the Lower
                    Antilles.</p>
               <p>The above survey of the world shows that but very few of the principal families
                    of reptiles are peculiar to only one of the main “ regions.” The occurrence of
                    some freak, constituting a little family or sub-family by itself in some small
                    district, and therefore put down as peculiar to a whole wide region, cannot be
                    much of a criterion, <hi rend="italic">e.g. Rhachiodon, Elachistodon,</hi>
                    Acrochordinae, <hi rend="italic">Uroplates, Xenosaurus, Heloderma,</hi>
                    Aniellidae, <hi rend="italic">Dibamus,</hi> Anelytropidae <hi rend="sub">f</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">Platysternum.</hi> They are not characteristic of large
                    countries, but rather local freaks. Quite a number of very ancient families have
                    such a wide distribution that they also are of little critical value, notably
                    the peropodous snakes, which have survivors in almost any tropical country; such
                    cosmopolitans are also geckos and skinks.</p>
               <p>A difficulty which is ever present in such Zoogeographical investigations is the
                    uncertainty as to whether our zoological families and sub-families and even
                    genera are genuine units, or heterogeneous compounds, as for instance the
                    Anelytropidae, of which degraded skinks there is one in Mexico, two others in W.
                    Africa. <hi rend="italic">Heloderma</hi> in Mexico and <hi rend="italic"
                        >Lanthanotus</hi> in Borneo are both without much doubt descendants of some
                    Anguid stock, but when we now combine them, in deference to our highest
                    authority, as one family, we thereby raise the tremendous problem of the present
                    distribution of this family. Boas and pythons are likewise not above suspicion,
                    cf. some boas in Madagascar and the python <hi rend="italic">Loxocaemus</hi> in
                    Mexico. The OpisthogIyphous colubrines are almost certainly not a natural group,
                    not to speak of numerous genera of the aglyphous assembly. To avoid arguing in a
                    circle, such doubtful units had better be avoided whilst building hypotheses.</p>
               <p>G. Pfeffer has recently endeavoured to show by an elaborate careful paper (”
                    Zoogeographische Beziehungen Südamerikas,” <hi rend="italic">Zool. Jahrf.,</hi>
                    Suppl, viii., 1905), ” that nearly all the principal groups of reptiles,
                    amphibians and fishes had formerly a universal or sub-universal distribution,
                    and that therefore it is not necessary to assume a direct land connexion of S.
                    America with either Africa or Australia, with or without an Antarctic.” Many
                    cases of such a former universal distribution are undoubtedly true, but the
                    question remains how the respective creatures managed to attain it.</p>
               <p>For true characterization of large areas we must resort to the combination of
                    some of the large wide-ranging families, and equally important is the absence of
                    certain large groups; both to be selected from the following table.</p>

                </table>
               <p>Deductions from this table show, for instance, that Australia is quite
                    sufficiently characterized by the possession of Chelydidae and Varanidae;
                    Madagascar by the presence of chameleons and Pelomedusidae.. On the other hand,
                    the separation of the whole of Africa from Asia,.or the diagnosis of the
                    palaearctic ” region,” would require the combination of several positive
                    and-negative characters.</p>
               <p>Chelonians are very diagnostic, expressed by the following combinations of
                    families:—</p>
               <p>America as a whole: Chelydridae and Cinosterridae and Der-matemydidae.</p>
               <p>N. America: Chelydridae and Trionychidae, but only E. of the Rockies.</p>
               <p>S. America: Chelydidaeand Pelomedusidae.</p>
               <p>Africa : Trionychidae and Pelomedusidae.</p>
               <p>Madagascar: Pelomedusidae and Testudinidae.</p>
               <p>India and Eurasia: Trionychidae and Testudinidae.</p>
               <p>Australia: Chelydidaeonly..</p>
               <p>That the Chelonians are regionally so very diagnostic that their main families
                    are still in rational agreement with the main divisions of land, is perhaps due,
                    first, to their being an ancient group ; secondly, to their limited means of
                    distribution (none across the seas, omitting of course Cheloniidae,
                    &amp;c.); and lastly, to their being rather indifferent to climate. Note,
                    for instance, <hi rend="italic">Trionyx ferox</hi> from the ' Canadian lakes to
                    the Gulf of Mexico, <hi rend="italic">Cinosternum pennsylvanicum</hi> from New
                    York to New Orleans. It may be taken for certain that wherever a <hi
                        rend="italic">Testudo</hi> occurs as a genuine native, it has got there by
                    land, be the locality the Galapagos, Aldabra, Madagascar or some Malay islands.
                    The Trionychidae reveal themselves as of periarctic origin, being debarred from
                    Australia, Madagascar and the neotropical region (alleged from Eocene
                    Patagonia). Testu-dinidae are cosmopolitan, excluding Australia, and practically
                    also the Antilles; and <hi rend="italic">Testudo</hi> is most instructive
                    with.its almost similar distribution; but something has gone wrong with this
                    genus in America, where it flourished in mid-Tertiary times.</p>
               <p>PIeurodira are less satisfactory than they api^ear to be from a merely
                    statistical point of view. The Pelomedysidae, being known from European Trias
                    and from nearctic cretaceous formations,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0176" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0199.jp2"/>
               <p>may have had a world-wide distribution;, but Chelydidae may well have centred in
                    an antarctic continent. Chelydridae were periarctic and have disappeared from
                    Eurasia; -N. American offshoots are the Cinosterridae and Dermatemydidae, the
                    latter now restricted to Central American countries.</p>
               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Crocodilia,</hi> probably once universal, afford through the
                    Chinese <hi rend="italic">alligator</hi> an instance of the original intimate
                    connexion of the whole holarctic region, paralleled by many other animals which

               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">Lacertilia</hi> are less satisfactory, for short diagnoses.
                    America alone combines Iguanidae and Tejidae:—</p>
               <p>N. America: Iguanidae, Anguidae, Tejidae (and Rhineura in Florida).</p>
               <p>S. America: Iguanidae, Anguidae, Tejidae and many Amphis-baenidae.</p>
               <p>Africa and Madagascar: Chameleons and Zonuridae and Gerrho-sauridac.</p>
               <p>Madagascar: Chameleons and Iguanidae.</p>
               <p>India : Varanidae, Agamidae and Lacertidae, all of which also in Africa.</p>
               <p>Australia alone has Pygopodidae.</p>
               <p>The Lacertilia are now distributed upon principles very different from those of
                    the tortoises. According to the lizards the world is divided into an E. and a W.
                    half. The W. alone has Iguanidae and Tejidae <hi rend="sub">1</hi> the E. alone
                    that important combination of Varanidae and Agamidae. Further subdivision is in
                    most cases possible only by exclusion, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> exclusion of
                    Lacertilia and chameleons , from Australia; of Varanidae and. Agamidae from
                    Madagascar. Lizards are rather susceptible to climatic conditions, iniinitely
                    more than water tortoises.</p>
               <p>As regards <hi rend="italic">Ophidia,</hi> America has Crotalinae and Elapinae,
                    but no Viperinae. Eurasia and India alone combines Viperinae, Crotalinae and
                    Elapinae. Africa, Viperinae and Elapinae but no Crotalinae. Australia only
                    EUpinae. Madagascar none, of these groups.</p>
               <p>The Viperinae must have had their original centre in the palaearctic countries,
                    and they have been debarred only from Australia and Madagascar. Both vipers and
                    pit vipers , are still in Asia, but true vipers are absent in America, with
                    their fullest development now in Africa, whilst pit vipers went E., covering now
                    the whole of America, and having developed the rattlesnakes in Sonora-land. The
                    Elapinae are undoubtedly of Asiatic origin; they have overrun Africa, were too
                    late for Madagascar, but early enough for Australia, where they are only
                    poisonous, snakes; and only one genus, <hi rend="italic">Elaps,</hi> has got
                    into, or rather, has differentiated in America, in the S. of which it is
                    abundant.</p>
               <p>Opisthoglypha are useless for our purpose; they are cosmopolitan, with the
                    exception of Australia but probably they have one ancient centre in S. America,
                    and another in the old world.</p>
               <p>Amblycephalidae afford another of those curious instances of apparent affinity
                    between S.E. Asia anti Centnd America; paralleled by <hi rend="italic">Pelamis
                        bicolor,</hi> which ranges from Madagascar to Panama, while all the other
                    Hydrophinae belong to the Indian Ocean and the E. Asiatic seas. Aglyphous
                    Colubrines show undoubted affinity between N.. America and Eurasia; the whole
                    group is absolutely cosmopolitan, and many of the genera, <hi rend="italic">e.g.
                        Coluber, Tropidonotus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Coronclla,</hi> have proved
                    their success by having acquired an enormous range. Snakes have comparatively
                    few enemies, and they possess exceptional means of distribution. It is rare for
                    a terrestrial species to have such a wide range as <hi rend="italic">Crotalus
                        terrificus,</hi> from. Arizona to Argentina, or as the India cobra, which,
                    like the tiger, is equally at home in Malay islands, Manchuria and Turkestan.</p>
               <p>The tortoises divide the habitable world into a S. and a N. world, much as do
                    the anurous Batrachians; the lizards split it into an E. and a W. hemisphere.
                    The poisonous snakes, the most recent of reptiles in their full development and
                    distribution, allow us to distinguish between Australia, America and the rest of
                    the world.</p>
