<p><span class="font1">Stegocephali and most Anura form the centre), therefore the typical batrachian vertebrae are notocentrous. If the remaining three pairs of constituent elements of each vertebra&nbsp;(the neural arch, the centrum and the intercentra) remain&nbsp;separate, the vertebrae are called temnospondylous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(τέμνω,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">I cut, σ7τόρδνλο5, a vertebra). If the neural arches and the centra&nbsp;are suturally united, or are fused with each other, the vertebrae&nbsp;are called Stereospondylous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(στερεός,</span><span class="font1"> solid). In many fossil&nbsp;reptiles most or many of the vertebrae are temnospondylous;&nbsp;in most of the recent Amniota@@<sup>1</sup> they are consoEdated, but the&nbsp;atlas or first vertebra remains usually in a relatively primitive&nbsp;condition, and is temnospondylous but for the usual modification&nbsp;that its centrum becomes attached to that of the second vertebra&nbsp;and forms its odontoid process. The composition of gastrocentrous vertebrae is best illustrated by the first and second cervical&nbsp;vertebrae of crocodiles, whence by reduction and fusion the&nbsp;structure of every other vertebra can be explained. We have&nbsp;only to add that the ribs are genetically derived from lateral&nbsp;outgrowths of the basiventral elements, whilst the chevron bones&nbsp;are mere ventral outgrowths from the same basal cartilages.&nbsp;The most primitive vertebral column is that of tbe Geckos. The</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">vertebra consists chiefly of a large neural arch which rests broadly upon the centrum; this is a tube, more or less calcified and&nbsp;ossified, with a narrow waist in the middle, widening head- and&nbsp;tail wards. The tube is hollow, the chorda dorsalis passing&nbsp;through the whole column, and there are no proper joints&nbsp;between the centra, which are amphicoelous. Between the&nbsp;centra lies a separate element, the so-called intercentrum, which&nbsp;is ring-shaped and acts as an interarticular pad instead of a&nbsp;joint. The first of these rings forms the ventral half of the atlas&nbsp;ring; the second is attached to the cranial surface of the second&nbsp;centrum, and produces, Eke some of the next following ones, a&nbsp;vertical median blade of bone, a true hypapophysis. Such&nbsp;intercentra exist throughout the length of the vertebral column;&nbsp;in the tail they are enlarged and carry a pair of chevrons, which&nbsp;are cartilaginous and have the tendency of fusing by superficial</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">ossification on to the caudal ends of the centrum next in front, to which they do not belong genetically. Exactly in the middle&nbsp;of each vertebra the thin shell of the centrum forms a cartilaginous septum, of what is often wrongly called chordal cartilage. When this septum is complete, and this seems to be&nbsp;the normal condition in the tail, the chorda is here rent&nbsp;asunder, otherwise it is only constricted. This septum is but&nbsp;slightly invaded by ossification, and consists of large cells&nbsp;which retain the appearance of young or embryonic cartilage.&nbsp;It coincides exactly with the line of transverse division of&nbsp;most of the caudal vertebrae into</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">an anterior and a posterior half,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the division gradually extend</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ing right through the bone of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the neural arch. The same kind</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of division, and from the same</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">causes, exists in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and in many lizards, in fact</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in all those reptiles which can</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">reproduce their broken-off tail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is from the septal cartilage</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">that the regeneration starts<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(fig. 26).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font1"> also has biconcave vertebrae owing to the persistence of the chorda dorsalis in the intervertebral region; otherwise the vertebrae are solid. Intercentra occur from the&nbsp;atlas regularly into the tail, where they carry chevron bones.&nbsp;The atlas-ring (fig. 25, 9) is composed of the first intercentrum&nbsp;and a pair of neural arches which remain quite separate and&nbsp;carry on the dorsal side a pair of ossicles, the disconnected&nbsp;supradorsal elements of the atlas, erroneously supposed to be&nbsp;the remnants of the “ proatlas.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocodiles.—</span><span class="font1">Remnants of the chorda persist in the middle of the centra, which, in recent species, are mostly procoelous, and&nbsp;with a convex knob behind, but the first caudal is strongly&nbsp;biconvex.' Cartilaginous intercentral rings, pads or menisci,&nbsp;occur throughout the column; in the tail they carry chevrons.&nbsp;For the instructive detail of the composition of the first and&nbsp;second cervical vertebrae see fig. 25, 7 and 8. Some of the&nbsp;posterior neck and anterior thoracic vertebrae have an unpaired&nbsp;hypapophysis arising from the centrum. The vertebrae have&nbsp;the usual processes, viz. spinous process, a pair of anterior and&nbsp;posterior zygapophyses arising from the neural arch, diapophyses&nbsp;likewise from this arch for the articulation with the tubercular&nbsp;portion of the rib; short parapophyses from the centra for the&nbsp;capitular ends of the ribs; the transverse processes of the&nbsp;12th vertebra, and following, carry the whole rib, and are like&nbsp;the processes of the lumbar vertebrae diapapophyses; the&nbsp;so-called transverse processes of the tail are mainly the anchy-losed or fused ribs themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonians.—</span><span class="font1">The vertebrae are sometimes in the various regions of the same column opistho-pro-or amphicoelous, or even&nbsp;biconvex. Intercentra occur regularly on the first two or three&nbsp;cervicals, and on the tail as paired or unpaired nodules, or as&nbsp;chevrons, which articulate mostly with the previous centra and&nbsp;occasionally fuse with them. Intercentral, fibrocartilaginous&nbsp;disks occur regularly, mostly in the shape of rings; the first is&nbsp;the transverse ligament of the atlas-ring. In the Trionychidae&nbsp;(fig. 25, 10), but also in some other tortoises, the various pieces&nbsp;of the atlas do not anchylose, and the first centrum remains also&nbsp;movably attached to the second, although it sometimes carries,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> There remained a flaw in the correctness of the view that the bodies of the amniotic vertebrae are formed by the paired interven-tral pieces, since the bodies were known always to appear from the&nbsp;first as unpaired, cartilaginous masses, until G. B. Howes found&nbsp;them to consist of a right and left pair in the embryos </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>2</sup> Regeneration of the tail can take place in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon,</span><span class="font0"> all Geckos, Anguidae, Gerrhosauridae, Lacertidae, most Scincidae, and in many&nbsp;Tejidae and Iguanidae; certainly not in chameleons, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Varanus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Agamidae, snakes, crocodiles and tortoises. Often the tail is so&nbsp;brittle and the muscular cones are so loosely connected that part&nbsp;can be thrown off by the muscular exertion of the creature itself.&nbsp;The reproduced tail is, however, only a sham tail, since neither&nbsp;centra nor arches, but only a non-segmented rod or tube of fibro-cartilage is produced. It is, however, invested with new muscles&nbsp;and with skin, but the scales often differ considerably from thosc of&nbsp;the normal organ, sometimes showing reversion to an ancestral&nbsp;form.
