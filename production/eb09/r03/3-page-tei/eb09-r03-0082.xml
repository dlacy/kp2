Rome and Italy share in the decline of the republic. Political independence and activity die out ; their old preeminence and exclusive privileges gradually disappear ; and at the same time the weight of the overwhelming power of the princeps, and the abuses of their power by individual “ principes,” press most heavily upon them. On the other hantl, in the provinces and on the frontiers, where the imperial system was most needed, and where from the first it had full play, unfettered by the fictions of republican government, it is seen at its best as developing or protecting an orderly civilization and maintaining the peace of the world.</p><p>The decay of the republican institutions had commenced before the revolutionary crisis of 49. It was accelerated by the virtual suspension of all regular government between 49 and 28 ; and not even the diplomatic deference towards ancient forms which Augustus displayed availed to conceal the unreality of his work of restoration. The “ comitia ” received back from him “ their ancient rights,”@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and during his lifetime they continued to pass laws and to elect magistrates. But after the end of the reign of Tiberius we have only two instances of legislation by the assembly in the ordinary way,@@<hi rend="sup">2 </hi>and the law-making of the empire is performed either by decrees of the senate or by imperial edicts and constitutions. Their prerogative of electing magistrates was, even under Augustus, robbed of most of its importance by the control which the princeps exercised over their choice by means of his rights of nomination and commendation, rights which effectually secured the election of his own nominees.@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi> By Tiberius even this restricted prerogative was still further curtailed. The candidates for all magistracies except the consulship were thenceforward nominated and voted for in the senate-house and by the senators,@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi> and only the “ renuntiatio,” the formal return of the result, and the introduction of the magistrates designate to the people took place in the assembly.@@<hi rend="sup">5 </hi>And, though the election of consuls was never thus transferred to the senate, the process of voting seems to have been silently abandoned. In the time of the younger Pliny we hear only of the nomination’ of the candidates and of their formal “renuntiatio ” in the Campus Martius.@@<hi rend="sup">6 </hi>By this empty form the ancient right of the people to confer all magisterial authority was saved, at least in appearance ; and it was acknowledged in as purely formal a manner in the case of the princeps himself, who, as long as the principate lasted, continued to receive the “ tribunicia potestas ” by a vote of the assembly, and was thus held to derive his authority from the people.@@<hi rend="sup">7</hi></p><p>This almost complete effacement of the “ comitia ” was largely due to the fact that they had ceased to represent anything but the populace of Rome, and the comparatively greater vitality shown by the old magistracies is mainly attributable to the value they continued to possess in the eyes of the Roman upper class. But, though they were</p><p>eagerly sought,@@<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and conferred on their holders considerable social distinction, the magistrates ceased, except in name, to be the popularly chosen executive officers of the Roman state. In the administration of the empire at large they had no share, if we except the subordinate duties still assigned to the quæstor in a province. In Rome, to which their sphere of work was limited, they were overshadowed by the dominant authority of the princeps, while their range of duties was increasingly circumscribed by the gradual transference of administrative authority, even within the city, to the emperor and his subordinate officials. And their dependence on the princeps was confirmed by the control he exercised over their appointment For all candidates the approval, if not the commendation, of the princeps became the indispensable condition of success, and the princeps on his side treated these ancient offices as pieces of preferment with which to reward his adherents or gratify the ambition of Roman nobles. In all instances, too, the dignity of the office was impaired by the practice, begun by Cæsar and continued by Augustus and his successors, of granting the insignia to men who had not held the actual magistracy itself.@@<hi rend="sup">9</hi> The change is especially noticeable in the case of the consuls, the chief magistrates of the old commonwealth. The consulship was still the highest post open to the private citizen,@@<hi rend="sup">10</hi> and consular rank a necessary qualification for high office in the provinces ;@@<hi rend="sup">11</hi> but the actual consuls have scarcely any other duties than those of presiding in the senate, conducting its proceedings, and occasionally executing its decrees,@@<hi rend="sup">12</hi> while their term of office dwindles from a year to six and finally to two months.@@<hi rend="sup">13</hi> In the age of Tacitus and the younger Pliny, the contrast is striking enough between the high estimate set on the dignity of the office and the frankness with which both its limited powers and its dependence on the emperor are acknowledged.@@<hi rend="sup">14</hi> Of the other magistrates the prætors continued to exercise their old jurisdiction with little formal change down at least to the latter half of the second century, but only as subordinate to the higher judicial authority of the emperor.@@<hi rend="sup">15</hi> The ædiles seem to have retained only such petty police duties as did not pass to one or another of the numerous imperial prefects and commissioners.@@<hi rend="sup">16 </hi>The tribunate fared still worse, for, by the side of the tribunicia potestas wielded by the princeps, it sank into insignificance, and it is described by the younger Pliny as a “ shadow and an empty name.”@@<hi rend="sup">17</hi> The quæstorship</p><p>@@@    Suet.,<hi rend="italic">Aug.,</hi>  40, “Comitiorum pristinum jus reduxit.”</p><p>@@@    The “plébiscita” of Claudius, Tac.,<hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi>  xi. 13, 14, and the “lex agraria” of Nerva; <hi rend="italic">Digest,</hi>  xlvii. 21, 3; Dio, Ixviii. 2; Plin., <hi rend="italic">Epp.,</hi>  vii. 31.</p><p>@@@    For the nature of these rights, the latter of which was not exercised in the case of the consulship until the time of Vespasian, see Mommsen,<hi rend="italic">Staatsr.,</hi>  ii. 861-869 ; Tac., <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi>  i. 14, 15, 81; Suet., <hi rend="italic">Aug.,</hi>  56; Dio, lviii. 20.</p><p>@@@    Tac.,<hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi>  i. 15, “comitia e campo ad patres translata sunt”; compare <hi rend="italic">Ann.,</hi>  xiv. 28.
