<p><span class="font0">from Rienzi. But, whereas, elsewhere tyrants were gradually arising in the citizen class, Rome was always in danger of&nbsp;oppression by the pope. Nor was any aid available from the&nbsp;empire, which had never recovered from its abasement under&nbsp;Louis the Bavarian. In fact, when Charles of Luxemburg&nbsp;came to Rome to be crowned, he was obliged to promise the&nbsp;pope that he would not enter the city. On Easter day 1355&nbsp;he received the crown, and departed after counselling&nbsp;the Romans to obey the pope. And the pontiffs had&nbsp;greater need than ever of an established kingdom.&nbsp;Their position in France was much endangered by&nbsp;that country’s disorder. New states were being&nbsp;formed on all sides ; the medieval unityx was shattered ;&nbsp;and the shrunken spiritual authority of the church increased&nbsp;her need of material strength. As Italian affairs stood, it&nbsp;would be easy for the popes to found a kingdom, but their&nbsp;presence was required in Rome before it could be firmly established. The blood-stained sword of Albornoz had prepared&nbsp;the way before them. In 1355-56 he vanquished the lords or&nbsp;tyrants of Rimini, Fano, Fossombrone, Pesaro, Urbino and&nbsp;other cities. And all these places had, been so rudely oppressed&nbsp;that the cardinal was often hailed as a liberator after subduing&nbsp;their masters by fire and sword. But everywhere he had been&nbsp;obliged to leave existing governments and rulers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in statu quo&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">after exacting their oaths of fealty. Thus the state was still&nbsp;dissevered, and it was impossible to bind it together with the&nbsp;pope at Avignon and Rome a republic. Bologna was still independent, Ordelaffi still lord of Forlì; Cesena and other cities&nbsp;were still rebellious; and the Campagna was still in the hands&nbsp;of the barons. Some places were ruled by rectors nominated&nbsp;by the pope; at Montefiascone there was an ecclesiastical&nbsp;rector, with a bench of judges, and a captain commanding a&nbsp;mixed band of adventurers. Rome had submitted to the&nbsp;haughty cardinal, but hated him mortally, and, on his departure&nbsp;for Avignon in 1357 to assist the threatened pontiff, immediately&nbsp;conceded to the latter the supremacy of the senate. And the&nbsp;pope, instead of two senators, hastened to name a single one&nbsp;of foreign birth. This was a shrewd device of Albornoz and&nbsp;another blow to the nobles, with whom he was still at war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus was inaugurated, by fhe nomination of Raimondo de’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tolomei in 1358, a series of foreign senators, fulfilling the functions of a podestà, and changed every six&nbsp;months, together with their staff of judges, notaries&nbsp;and knights.- The people approved of this reform as being&nbsp;inimical to the nobles and favourable to the preservation of&nbsp;liberty. Hitherto the senators had been assisted, or rather&nbsp;kept in check, by the thirteen representatives of the regions.&nbsp;These were now replaced by seven reformers, in imitation of&nbsp;the priors of Florence, the better to follow that city’s example.&nbsp;The reformers were soon the veritable chiefs of the republic.&nbsp;They first appeared in 1360, were either </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">popolani</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cavalier otti,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and were elected by ballot every three months. When Albornoz&nbsp;returned to Italy, although desirous to keep Rome in the same&nbsp;subjection as the other cities, he had first to vanquish Ordelaffi&nbsp;and reduce Bologna. The latter enterprise was the more&nbsp;difficult task, and provoked a lengthy war with Matteo Visconti&nbsp;of Milan. Thus Rome, being left to herself, continued to be&nbsp;governed by her reformers; and the nobles, already shut out&nbsp;from power, were also excluded from the militia, which had been&nbsp;reorganized, like that of Florence, on the democratic system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Three thousand men, mostly archers, were enrolled under the command of two </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi, </span><span class="font0">“ in the likeness,” says M. Villani, <sup>u</sup> of our gonfaloniers of the companies, ” with four </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">antepositi</span><span class="font0"> constituting a supreme council&nbsp;of war. And the whole body was styled the <sup>(i</sup> Felix Societas&nbsp;Balestrariorum et Pavesatorum. ” It was instituted to support&nbsp;the reformers and re-establish order in the city and Campagna,&nbsp;to keep down the nobles and defend the republic. It fulfilled&nbsp;these duties with much, and sometimes excessive, severity.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Banderesi</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">antepositi</span><span class="font0"> had seats in the special council beside&nbsp;those of the reformers, as, in Florence, the gonfaloniers of the&nbsp;companies were seated beside the priors. Later these officials&nbsp;constituted the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">signoria dei banderesi.</span><span class="font0"> In 1362, the&nbsp;Romans having subjected Velletri, which was defended by the&nbsp;nobles, the latter made a riot in Rome. Thereupon the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">drove them all from the city, killed some of their kindred, and&nbsp;did not even spare the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cavallerotti.</span><span class="font0"> The fight became so furious&nbsp;that from gate to gate all Rome was in arms, and even mercenaries were hired. But in the end renewed submission was made&nbsp;to the pope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the death of Innocent VI. in 1362, an agreement was concluded with his successor, Urban V. (1362-70), also a Frenchman, who was obliged to give his sanction to the government&nbsp;of the reformers and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi.</span><span class="font0"> And then, Albornoz being&nbsp;recalled in disgrace to Avignon, and afterwards sent as legate&nbsp;to Naples, these Roman magistrates were able, with or without&nbsp;the co-operation of the foreign senator, to rule in their own&nbsp;way. They did justice on the nobles by hanging a few more;&nbsp;and they defended the city from the threatening attacks of&nbsp;the mercenaries, who had now become Italy’s worst foes. It&nbsp;was at this period that the Roman statutes were revised and&nbsp;rearranged in the compilation erroneously attributed by some&nbsp;writers to Albornoz, which has come down to us supplemented&nbsp;by alterations of a later date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But now the popes, being no longer in safety at Avignon, really decided to return to Italy. Even Urban V. had to pay&nbsp;ransom to escape from the threatened attacks of the free companies. The Romans implored his return, and he was further&nbsp;urged to it by the Italian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">literati,</span><span class="font0"> with Petrarch at their head.&nbsp;In April 1367 he finally quitted Avignon, and, entering Rome on&nbsp;the 16th of October, was given the lordship of the city. Cardinal&nbsp;Albornoz had fallen mortally ill at Viterbo, but, though unable&nbsp;to accompany the pope to Rome, had, before dying, suggested&nbsp;his course of action. Certainly Urban showed much&nbsp;acumen in profiting by the first burst of popular&nbsp;enthusiasm to effect quick and dexterous changes in&nbsp;the constitution of the republic. After naming a&nbsp;senator, he abolished the posts of reformers and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi,</span><span class="font0"> substituting three conservators, or rather a species&nbsp;of municipal council, alone charged with judicial and administrative powers, which has lasted to the present day. The&nbsp;thirteen leaders of the regions and the consuls of the ¿Ids still&nbsp;sat in the councils, which were left unsuppressed. But all real&nbsp;power was in the hands of the pope, who, in Rome, as in his&nbsp;other cities, nominated the principal magistrates. Thus, by&nbsp;transforming political into civil institutions and concentrating&nbsp;the supreme authority in his own grasp, Urban V. dealt a&nbsp;mortal blow to the liberties of Rome. Yet he felt no sense of&nbsp;security among a people who, after the first rejoicings over the&nbsp;return of the Holy See, were always on the brink of revolt.&nbsp;Besides, he felt himself a stranger in Italy, and was so regarded.&nbsp;Accordingly, in April 1370 he decided to return to France;&nbsp;on the 20th of that month he wrote from Viterbo that no&nbsp;change was to be made in the government; and he died in&nbsp;Avignon on the 19th of December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Romans retained the conservators, conferring on them the political power of the reformers; they re-established the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi</span><span class="font0"> with the Florentine title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">exccutores jus*&nbsp;titiae</span><span class="font0"> and the four </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">antepositi</span><span class="font0"> with that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">consiliarii.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus the “ Felix Societas Balestrariorum et Pavesatorum Urbis ” was restored, and the two councils met as before. The new French pope, Gregory XI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1370-78), had to be content with obtaining supremacy over the senate and the possession of the castle of St Angelo.&nbsp;It was a difficult moment for him. The Florentines had come&nbsp;to an open rupture with his legates, and had adopted the&nbsp;expedient of inviting all the cities of the Roman state to redeem&nbsp;their lost freedom. Accordingly, in 1375 many of them rose&nbsp;against the legates, who were mostly French and regarded&nbsp;with dislike as foreigners. Florentine despatches, full of&nbsp;classical allusions and chiefly composed by the famous scholar&nbsp;Secretary Coluccio Salutati, were rapidly sent in all directions.&nbsp;Those addressed to the Romans w’ere specially fervid, and&nbsp;emphatically appealed to their patriotism and memories of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
