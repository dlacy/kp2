The confequence of all this was, that every one was eager to provide himſelf with theſe ſalutary reme-dies ; conſequently, great numbers undertook fatiguing and perilous voyages, and ſubjected themſelves to all ſorts of hardſhips ; while others made uſe of this delu-fion to accumulate their riches, and to impofe upon the miſerable multitude by the moſt impious and ſhocking inventions. As the demand for relics was prodigious and univerſal, the clergy employed the utmoſt dex-terity to ſatisfy all demands, and were far from being nice in the methods they uſed for that end. The bo-dies of the ſaints were fought by faſting and prayer, in-ſtituted by the prieſt in order to obtain a divine anſwer and an infallible direction, and this pretended direction never failed to accompliſh their deſires ; the holy car-cafe was always found, and that always in conſequence, as they impiouſly gave out, of the ſuggeſtion and infpi-ration of God himſelf. Each difcovery of this kind was attended with exceffive demonſtrations of joy, and animated the zeal of thefe devout feekers to enrich the church ſtill more and more with this new kind of trea-ſure. Many travelled with this view into the Eaſtern provinces, and frequented the places which Chriſt and his diſciples had honoured with their preſence, that, with the bones and other ſacred remains of the firſt he-ralds of the goſpel, they might comfort dejected minds, ■calm trembling confciences, fave finking ſtates, and de-fend their inhabitants from all forts of calamities. Nor did thefe pious travellers return home empty ; the craft, dexterity, and knavery of the Greeks, found a rich prey in the ſtupid credulity of the Latin relic-hunters, and made a profitable commerce of this new devotion. The latter paid conſiderable ſums for legs and arms, ikulls and jaw-bones (ſeveral of which were Pagan, and ſome not human), and other things that were ſuppoſed to have belonged to the primitive worthies of the Chriſtian church ; and thus the Latin churches came to the poſſeſſion of thoſe celebrated relics of St Mark, St James, St Bartholomew, Cyprian, Pan-taleon, and other?, which they ſhow at this day with fo much oſtentation. But there were many who, un-able to procure for themſelves theſe ſpiritual treaſures by voyages and prayers, had recourſe to violence and theft ; for all ſorts of means, and all forts of attempts in a cauſe of this nature, were conſidered, when fucceſs-ful, as pious and acceptable to the Supreme Being.— Beſides the arguments from antiquity to which the Pa-piſts refer, in vindication of their worſhip of relics, of which the reader may form ſome judgment from this article, Bellarmine appeals to Scripture in ſupport of it, and cites the following paſſages, viz. Exod. xiii. 19. ; Deut. xxxiv. 6. ; 2 Kings xiii. 21. ; 2 Kings xxiii. 16, 17, 18.; Iſaiah xi. 10. ; Matthewxi. 20, 21, 22. ; Acts v. 12- 15. ; Acts xix. ii, 12. See Popery.</p><p>The Roman Catholics in Great Britain do not ac-knowledge any worſhip to be due to relics, but merely a high veneration and reſpe i, by which means they think they honour God, who, they ſay, has often wrought very extraordinary miracles by them. But, however proper this veneration and reſpect may be, its abuſe has been ſo great and ſo general, as fully to war-rant the rejection of them altogether.</p><p>Relics are forbidden to be uſed or brought into England by ſeveral ſtatutes ; and juſtices oſ peace are empowered to ſearch houles for popiſh books and relics,</p><p>which, when found, are to be defaced and burnt, &amp;c, 3 Jac.

See Pri-mer.</p><p>Though reliefs had their original while feuds were only life-eſtates, yet they continued after feuds became hereditary; and were therefore looked upon, very juſtly, as one of the greateſt grievances of tenure : eſpecially when, at the firſt, they were merely arbitrary and at the will of the lord ; ſo that, if he pleaſed to demand an exorbitant relief, it was in effect to diſinherit the heir. The Engliih ill brooked this conſequence of their new-adopted policy; and there-fore william the Conqueror by his laws <hi rend="italic">afcertained</hi>  the relief, by directing (in imitation of the Daniſh he-riots), that a certain quantity of arms, and habiliments of war, ſhonld be paid by the earls, barons, and vavaſours refpectively ; and, if the latter had no arms, they ſhould pay 100s. william Rufus broke through this compoſition, and again demanded arbitrary un-certain reliefs, as due by the feodal laws ; thereby in effect obliging every heir to new-purchaſe or <hi rend="italic">redeem </hi>his land: but his brother Henry I. by the charter be-fore-mentioned, reſtored his father’s law ; and ordained, that the relief to be paid ſhould be according to the law ſo eſtabliſhed, and not an arbitrary redemption.—■ But afterwards, when, by an ordinance in 27 Hen. II. called the <hi rend="italic">afiſe oſ arms,</hi>  it was provided, that every man’s armour ſhould deſcend to his heir, for defence of the realm, and it thereby became impracticable to pay theſe acknowledgments in arms according to the laws of the Conqueror,<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  the compoſition was univer-fally accepted of 100 s. for every knight’s fee, as ws find it ever after eſtabliſhed.
