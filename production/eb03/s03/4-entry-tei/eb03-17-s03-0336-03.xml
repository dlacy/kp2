the largeſt river in Ireland, and one of the fineſt in the Britiſh dominions, not only on account of its rolling 200 miles, but alſo of its great depth in moſt places, and the gentleneſs of its current, by which it might be made exceedingly ſerviceable to the improvement of the country, the communication of its inhabitants, and conſequently the promoting of inland trade, through the greateſt part of its long courle. But the peculiar prerogative of the Shannon is its ſituation, running from north to ſouth, and separating the province of Connaught from Leinſter and Munſter, and of conſequence dividing the greateſt part of Ireland into what lies on the eaſt and that on the west of the river ; watering in its paſſage the valuable county of Leitrim, the plentiful (hire of Roſcommon, the fruitful county of Galway, and the pleaſant county of Clare ; the ſmall but fine ſhire of Longford, the King’s county, and fertile county of Meath in Leinſter, the populous county of Tipperary, the ſpacious ſhire of Limerick, and the rough but pleaſant county of Kerry in Munſter ; viſiting 10 counties in its paſſage, and having on its banks the following remarkable places, viz. Leitrim, Jameſtown, Laneſhorough, Athlone, Clonfert, Killaloe, and Limerick ; at 20 leagues below the latter it ſpreads gradually ſeveral miles in extent, ſo that ſome have conſidered its expanſion as a lake. It at laſt joins its waters to the ſea, being navigable all that way for the largeſt veſſels.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
