<p><span class="font3">an essentially representative element (though not resulting from direct election), apart altogether from the fact that heredity&nbsp;maintained there a number of persons whose title had descended from men who were originally representative Englishmen,&nbsp;and whose successors, on the whole, were no less so. In the&nbsp;days when kings really governed </span><span class="font2">in </span><span class="font3">England, the most powerful&nbsp;check on the king, in the interest of the nation at large, was the&nbsp;peerage; the earls and barons, in parliament, were the chief&nbsp;bulwark of the people against tyranny. It was they who stood&nbsp;for the nation in extorting Magna Carta from King John;&nbsp;and as time went on, the representation of the commons in&nbsp;parliament was largely due, not to any direct popular pressure,&nbsp;but to the desire of the kings to influence the lower ranks of&nbsp;society independently of the nobles. Up to the reign of Charles I.,&nbsp;at all events, the House of Lords was actually the predominant&nbsp;partner in parliament; the House of Commons was recruited&nbsp;from and returned by only a small section of the commons as&nbsp;now understood; and Oliver Cromwell—certainly a “ popular ”&nbsp;leader in the ordinary sense—made as short work of it as he&nbsp;did of the king himself. Up to 1832, when the first modern&nbsp;Reform Act was passed, the House of Commons was an oligarchical body, and the electors themselves were a small and&nbsp;privileged class. It is only since then—except in the granting of&nbsp;supplies—that first equality, and then predominance, in respect of&nbsp;the House of Lords, has been asserted by the House of Commons,&nbsp;owing to the fact that an extended suffrage has made the estate&nbsp;of the commons more adequately coincident with the nation as a&nbsp;whole. Prior to 1832 it was the king who directly made and&nbsp;unmade ministries; in 1835 for the first time the result of a&nbsp;general election caused a change of ministry; and the modem&nbsp;view of the House of Lords as purely a revising chamber dates&nbsp;only from then. But the very fact that the responsibility&nbsp;for creating new peerages now passed to ministers dependent&nbsp;on popular suffrage may well justify the contention that henceforth it indirectly included a select number of representative&nbsp;men of the nation, holding their seats in virtue of authoritative&nbsp;nomination and not by heredity. In the sixty years preceding&nbsp;1906 no fewer than‘419 new peerages were crcated, 238 by the&nbsp;Liberal party, 181 by the Conservative, or a balance of 57 creations&nbsp;on the Liberal side.@@<sup>1</sup> It is fair to assume that all these new&nbsp;peers were created as being representative men in the nation for&nbsp;one reason or another. And an analysis of the composition of the&nbsp;House of Lords in 1906 would have led an unprejudiced outside&nbsp;observer to suppose that its competence to speak on national&nbsp;affairs had not been ' weakened by any dependence on the&nbsp;hereditary title. It included 166 men who had been M.P.’s&nbsp;(i.e. had been elected by popular vote to the House of Commons),&nbsp;172 who had held government office, 140 who had been mayors&nbsp;of county councils, 207 who had served in the army or navy,&nbsp;40 who had been judges or lawyers, 7 ex-viceroys, 16 exgovernors of colonies, 50 who had been eminent in art, letters,&nbsp;manufactures or trade, and 21 archbishops or bishops (appointed&nbsp;by ministerial recommendation, but only after they had worked&nbsp;up to eminence from being curates, and therefore had wide&nbsp;experience of the social life of the people).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is possible to compare a chamber so composed somewhat favourably with a modem House of Commons, if the point at issue—the provision of “ representative men ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font3"> men generally accepted as national spokesmen)—be strictly&nbsp;considered, apart from the method of selecting them by direct&nbsp;popular vote.@@<sup>2</sup> In the House of Lords the method is heredity&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">plus</span><span class="font3"> selection by the political party which the popular vote&nbsp;has put in power; while in the election of members of the House&nbsp;of Commons the popular choice is doubly limited—first, by the&nbsp;fact that only the enfranchised commons can vote (in 1910&nbsp;about 7J millions out of 43); and secondly, because the&nbsp;choice must be made from among candidates who are&nbsp;themselves not disqualified for various reasons (for instance&nbsp;they must not be clergymen, nor entitled to seats in the House&nbsp;of Lords). Now, to carry out the real “ will of the nation ”&nbsp;in parliament must require (1) a reasonable knowledge of&nbsp;the wishes of the nation, and (2) an understanding of the&nbsp;best ways of expressing those wishes in legislation and administration. In the case of the peers, those who sit as having been&nbsp;originally created and therefore selected for the purpose—a&nbsp;considerable section of those actively attending—the qualifications are obvious: and it is only necessary to deal with&nbsp;those qualified by inheritance of title. Here too, in a number&nbsp;of cases, preceding experience in the House of Commons, to&nbsp;which the popular vote has returned them while they were only&nbsp;in the succession to a peerage, is a frequent factor; but, apart&nbsp;from that, the art of legislation is one which may well be considered to require .a certain special disposition and mental&nbsp;equipment. Though allowance must be made for exceptional&nbsp;cases, it is obvious that the son of a man who has been responsible for legislating, who has himself been brought up as one&nbsp;who will have to take his part in legislating, is most likely, .in&nbsp;any society, to have qualified himself for the business, as in&nbsp;the case of any profession or trade. He has been accustomed&nbsp;to breathe the parliamentary atmosphere, and as one of a&nbsp;leisured class has had the opportunity to study the subject&nbsp;of legislation, and to obtain experience of its conditions. This-is so generally accepted that, in fact, the same theory is commonly applied to candidates for the House of Commons, and&nbsp;predominantly to members of that House who are given office.&nbsp;The names of more than one generation are writ large in English&nbsp;history in the case </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font3">the Pitts, Foxes, Grenvilles, Cannings,&nbsp;Cecils, Stanleys and Cavendishes. The sons of famous political&nbsp;commoners, a Gladstone, a Harcourt, a Churchill, a Primrose,&nbsp;a Chamberlain, have by consent a superior claim, even within&nbsp;the radical or popular party, by no means resting originally&nbsp;or primarily on known personal merit or proved experience, for&nbsp;selection as candidates and then for preferment to office; and&nbsp;it is a very common occurrence for younger sons of peers to be&nbsp;selected as candidates (liberal as much as conservative) for&nbsp;parliament, even though from general intellectual considerations they may appear in no way the equals of other men.&nbsp;They have been brought up to the business; and they are&nbsp;therefore adapted for it by heredity. If the House of Commons&nbsp;were deprived of Those members who obtained their seats or&nbsp;their offices primarily for reasons of heredity, it would lose&nbsp;many of its best men—as indeed it occasionally does, to its&nbsp;disadvantage and possibly to the chagrin of the individuals&nbsp;themselves, when succession to a peerage forces a prominent&nbsp;parliamentarian to relinquish his seat in the Lower House and&nbsp;to take his place in the “ unrepresentative ” chamber.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">@@@<sup>1</sup> Between January 1906 and January 1910 thirty-five more new peers were created by Liberal premiers, and seven more in June 1910.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">@@@<sup>2</sup> Speaking at Oldham on December 15, 1909, Lord Curzon said: “ I have taken out the. figures of the past 200 years, and 1 tell you&nbsp;this, that during that time 41 of our prime ministers have sat in the&nbsp;Lords and only 17 in the Commons; of our foreign secretaries, 56&nbsp;in the Lords and only 8 in the Commons; of our colonial secretaries,&nbsp;46 in the Lords and 25 in the Commons; of our war ministers, 29&nbsp;in the Lords and 31 in the Commons; of first lords of the Admiralty,&nbsp;48 in the Lords andÏ28 in the Commons.”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">It remains nevertheless the fact that, in politics, “ representative ” government means not so much government by men really Tepresentative<sup>x</sup>Of the nation as government in&nbsp;the name of the whole body of citizens (and predominantly the estate of the commons) through a chamber&nbsp;or chambers composed of elected deputies. The&nbsp;object in view is the expression of the “ will of the&nbsp;people ”—the people, that is, who are sovereign. Clearly the&nbsp;only pure case of such government can be in a republic,&nbsp;where there is only one “ estate,” the free citizens. The home&nbsp;and historical type of representative government, the United&nbsp;Kingdom, is strictly no such case, since the monarchy and&nbsp;the House of Lords exist and work on lines constitutionally&nbsp;independent of any direct contact with the electorate. British&nbsp;practice, however, is of vital importance for the theory of representative institutions, and it is worth while to point out that&nbsp;the “ will of the people ” may even so be effectively expressed—&nbsp;some people may think even more effectively expressed than&nbsp;in a pure republic.
