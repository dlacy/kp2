<p><label>REGNARD, JEAN FRANÇOIS</label>
(1655-1709), French comic dramatist, was born in Paris on the 7th of February 1655. His father, a rich shopkeeper, died when Regnard was about twenty, leaving him master of a considerable Iortune. He set off at once for ItaIy, and, after a series of romantic adventures, he journeyed by Holland, Denmark and Sweden to Lapland, and thence by Poland, Turkey, Hungary and Germany back to France. HereturnedtoParisatthe end of 1683, and bought the place of treasurer of France in the Paris district; he had a house at Paris in the Rue Richelieu; and he acquired the small estate of Grillon near Dourdan in the department of Seine-et-Oise, where he hunted, feasted and wrote comedies. This latter amusement he began in 1688 with a piece called <hi rend="italic">Le Divorce,</hi> which was performed at the Théâtre Italien. In four slight pieces of the same nature be collaborated with Charles Riviere Dufresny. He gained access to the Théâtre Français on the 19th of May 1694 with a piece called <hi rend="italic">Attendez-moi sous Forme <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> and two years later, on the 19th of December 1696, he produced there the masterly comedy of <hi rend="italic">Le Joueur,</hi> The idea of the play was evolved in collaboration with Dufresny, but the authors disagreed in carrying it out. Finally they each produced a comedy on the subject, Dufresny in prose, and Regnard in verse. Each accused the other of plagiarism. The plot of Regnard’s piece turns on the love of two sisters for Valère, the gambler, who loves one and pretends to love the other, really deceiving them both, because there is no room for any other passion in his character except the love of play. Other of his plays were <hi rend="italic">La Sérénade</hi> (1694), <hi rend="italic">Le Bourgeois de Falaise</hi> (1696), <hi rend="italic">Le Distrait</hi> (1697), <hi rend="italic">Dêmacrite</hi> (1700), <hi rend="italic">Le Retour imprévu</hi> (1700), <hi rend="italic">Les Folies amoureuses</hi> (1704), <hi rend="italic">Les Ménechmes</hi> (1705), a clever following of Plautus, and his masterpiece, <hi rend="italic">Le Légataire universel</hi> (1708).</p><p>Regnard’s death on the 4th of September 1709 renews the doubtful and romantic circumstances of his earlier life. Some hint at poison, but the truth seems to be that his death W’as hastened by the rate at which he lived.</p><p>Besides the plays noticed above and others, Regnard wrote miscellaneous poems, the autobiographical romance of <hi rend="italic">La Provençale,</hi> and several short accounts in prose of his travels, published posthumously under the title of <hi rend="italic">Voyages,</hi> Regnard had written a reply to the tenth satire of Boileau, <hi rend="italic">Contre les femmes,</hi> and Boileau had retorted by putting Regnard among the poets depreciated in his epistle <hi rend="italic">Sur mes vers.</hi> After the appearance of <hi rend="italic">Le Joueur</hi> the poet altered his opinion and cut out the allusion. The saying attributed to Boileau when some one, thinking to curry favour, remarked that Regnard was only a mediocre poet, “ <hi rend="italic">Il n'est pas médiocrement gai”</hi> is both true and very appropriate. His French style, especially in his purely prose works, is not considered faultless. He is often, unoriginal in his plots, and, whether Dufresny was Orwasnotjustified in his complaint about <hi rend="italic">Le Joueur <hi rend="sub">i</hi></hi> it seems likely that Regnard owed not a little to him and to others; but he had a thorough grasp of</p>
<pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0046" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0069.jp2"/><p>comic situation and incident, and a most amusing faculty of dialogue.</p><p>The first edition of Regnard's works was published in 1731 (5 vols., Rouen and Paris). There is a good selection of almost everything important in the Collection Didot (4 vols., 1819), but there is no absolutely complete edition. The best is that published by Crapelet (6 vols., Paris, 1822). A selection by L. Moland appeared in 1893. See also a <hi rend="italic">Bibliographie et iconographie des œuvres de J. F. Regnard</hi> (Paris, Rouquette, 1878) ; <hi rend="italic">Le Poète J, F, Regnard en son chasteau de Grillon,</hi> by J. Guyot (Paris, 1907).</p>
