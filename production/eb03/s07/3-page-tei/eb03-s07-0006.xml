A<hi rend="italic">naſarcous Hydrocele of the Scrotum.</hi></p><p>As ſoon as water has collected in any conſiderable quantity in the ſcrotum, a ſoft, inelaſtic, colourleſs tumor is obſerved over the whole of it ; impreſſions are eaſily received and retained for some time ; the ſkin at firſt preſerves its natural appearance, and the rugæ of the ſcrotum are not much altered ; but as the ſwelling advances, they gradually diſappear, and are at laſt totally obliterated. The ſwelling, from being at firſt ſoft, and of a conſiſtence ſimilar to dough, by degrees turns more firm, and the ſkin at laſt acquires an unnatural white ſhining appearance. The tumor at length becomes large ; and though originally confined to the ſcrotum, it at laſt ſpreads up the groin. The penis likewiſe becomes affected, and often so ſwelled and diſtorted as to excite much inconvenience and diſtreſs ; and although the ſcrotum is compoſed of parts which readily admit of dilatation, the tumor ſometimes becomes ſo enormous that it burſts from one end to the other.</p><p>In the ſurgical treatment of this diſeaſe punctures made with the point of a lancet are moſt adviſable, as large ſcarifications, in anaſarcous habits, are ſometimes apt to produce inflammation and mortification ; while simple punctures readily heal, and can be renewed with very little pain as frequently as may be necessary : and besides, punctures are equally uſeful with the incisions; for as the cells of the ſcrotum communicate freely, if the punctures be made fairly through the ſkin, the water drains off very readily, though not ſo ſoon as by ſcarification. Previous to the operation, beſmearing the part with ſome tough ointment of an innocent nature, and afterwards keeping it as dry as poſſible by a frequent renewal of dry ſoft linen cloths, in order to imbibe the moiſture, is here a necessary piece of attention. The want of this ſeems to be the cauſe of much of the miſchief which frequently enſues from operations of this kind. When ſcarifications or punctures go wrong by beginning to inflame and turn painful, &amp;c. a cold ſolution of ſaccharum faturni, applied upon ſoft linen, proves moſt effectual in putting a ſtop to the farther progreſs of the inflammation, and affords moſt immediate relief to the patient in the present diſtreſs. Lime water, employed in the ſame manner, proves alſo a very uſeful application. When, however, the diſorder proceeds to gain ground by a real mortification coming on, we ſhould immediately have recourſe to bark and other medicines uſually employed in ſuch affections.</p><p>Although the anaſarcous hydrocele, for the moſt part, depends upon a general dropsical tendency, ſome inſtances occur of a local cauſe producing a mere local dropſy of the ſcrotum. Thus, it has been known to happen from ſwellings in the groin and in the abdomen obſtructing the paſſage of the lymphatics. When this is the caſe, if tumors producing ſuch obſtructions can be extirpated, no other means will afford ſuch effectual relief; but when they are ſo deeply ſeated as to render any attempt for removing them improper, the practice we have already pointed out of making punctures in the moſt depending part of the tumor muſt be employed with a view to palliate ſuch ſymptoms as occur. It ſometimes happens in ſuppreſſion of urine, whether ariſing from ſtrictures in the urethra or from ſtones impacted in it, that the urethra burſts, and the urine in this manner getting acceſs to the cellular texture of the ſcrotum, an anaſarcous ſwelling rises immediately over the whole of it ; nor does it commonly diminiſh till the cauſe by which it is produced is removed.</p><p>In order to prevent the formation of ſinuſes, which in ſuch circumstances will otherwiſe be apt to occur, an inciſion ſhould be made into the tumor, and carried to ſuch a depth as is sufficient for reaching the wound in the urethra. In this manner a free vent will not only be given to the urine already diffuſed, but the farther collection of it may probably be prevented. If a ſtone impacted in the urethra be found to be the cauſe of effuſion, it ſhould be cut out ; and if the obſtruction be produced by ſtrictures in the urethra, they muſt be removed by a proper uſe of bougies The cauſe being thus removed, if the habit of body of the patient is good, and untainted with any venereal or other general affection, by dressing the ſore properly with ſoft eaſy applications, the opening into the urethra will probably heal, and a complete cure will in this manner be obtained. But when theſe ailments are complicated with any general affection, particularly with old venereal complaints, it frequently happens that neither mercury nor any other medicine has much influence in removing them.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sect.</hi> II. <hi rend="italic">Hydrocele of the Tunica Vaginalis Testis.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">In</hi> the healthy ſtate of the body, a ſmall quantity of aqueous fluid is exhaled for lubricating the ſurface of the teſticle, the ſuperfluous part of which is abſorbed by vessels appointed for that purpoſe. When the ſecretion of this fluid is either morbidly increaſed, or its abſorption diminiſhed, a preternatural collection of water is formed in the cavity of the vaginal coat, and hydrocele of the vaginal coat produced.</p><p>The ſymptoms are, a fulneſs at firſt obſerved about the inferior parts of the teſticle, and moſt remarkable when the patient is erect, becoming gradually more tenſe as the diſeaſe advances ; the tumor by degrees changing from the globular to the pyramidical form; no degree of pressure making the ſwelling diſappear at any period of the diſeaſe. In the early part of the diſeaſe therefore, if it be not combined with hernia, or with a hydrocele of the cord, the ſpermatic proceſs may be diſtinctly felt, becauſe the ſwelling does not extend beyond the ſcrotum. In its more advanced ſtate, it cannot be diſtinguiſhed : the weight of the tumor now drags the ſkin of the neighbouring parts ſo much as to cauſe the penis almoſt to diſappear ; and in this ſtate of the diſeaſe the teſticle cannot be felt without much difficulty. On a minute examination, a hardneſs is always to be felt along that part of the ſcrotum where the teſticle is situated ; and at this point pressure excites ſome uneafineſs. Fluctuation of a fluid may in general be diſtinguiſhed through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe. In late ſtages, however, the appearance of a fluid is not very evident.</p><p>The tranſparency of the tumor has been generally suppoſed to be the principal criterion of this ſpecies of the diſorder ; but this muſt depend upon the nature of the contents, or thickneſs oſ the ſac ; ſo that, though the transparency of the tumor is a certain ſign of the exiſtence of water, its opacity cannot upon any account be conſidered as an indication of its abſence. Through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe the tumor is not attended with pain, but ſome uneasineſs is commonly felt in the back by the weight of the ſwelling of the ſpermatic cord. This is more particularly the caſe when a ſuſpenſory bandage is not uſed.</p><p>In the radical cure of hydrocele, in whatever way it is attempted, ſome degree of fever and inflammation will take place. Under the circumſtances mentioned in the prognoſis, the operation, if properly performed, is generally attended with the moſt complete ſucceſs. But if the patient be very old, infirm, and diſeaſed, an operation may be attended with ſuch a degree of inflammation, and conſequent ſup-</p></body></text></TEI>
