<p><label>REVELS, MASTER OF THE</label>
. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> The word " revel ” meant properly a noisy or riotous tumult or merry-making, and is derived from O. Fr. <hi rend="italic">reveler,</hi> to rebel, to riot, make a noise; Lat. <hi rend="italic">rebellare.</hi> </note> —The history of the Revels office has an interesting place in that of the English stage (see also <hi rend="smallcaps">Drama,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Theatre).</hi> Among the expenses of the royal Wardrobe we find provision made for <hi rend="italic">tunicae</hi> and <hi rend="italic">vis er es</hi> in 1347 for the Christmas <hi rend="italic">ludi</hi> of Edward III.; during the reign of Henry VII. payments are also recorded for various forms of court revels; and it became regular, apparently, to appoint a special functionary, called Master of the Revels, to superintend the royal festivities, quite distinct from the Lord of Misrule <hi rend="italic">(q.v.).</hi> In Henry VII.’s time he seems to have been a minor official of the household. In Henry VIII.’s time, however, the post became more important, and an officer of the Wardrobe was permanently employed to act under the Master of the Revels. With the patent given to John Farlyon in 1534 as Yeoman of the Revels, what may be considered as an independent office of the Revels (within the general sphere of the lord chamberlain) came into being; and in 1544 Sir Thomas Cawarden received a patent as Master of the Revels, he being the first to become head of an independent <hi rend="italic">office, Magister Jocorum, Revelorum et Mascorum omnium et Singularium nostrorum Vulgariter nuncupatorum Revells and Masks.</hi> Cawarden was Master till 1559. Soon after his appointment, the office and its stores were transferred to a dissolved Dominican monastery at Blackfriars, having previously been housed at Warwick Inn in the city, the Charterhouse, and then at the priory of St John of Jerusalem in Clerkenwell, to which a return was made after Cawarden’s death. Sir Thomas Benger succeeded Cawarden, and Edmund Tylney followed him (1579-1610); it was the appointment of the latter’s nephew, Sir George Buck, as deputy-master, with the reversion to the mastership, which led to so much repining on the part of the dramatist, John Lyly, who was himself a candidate. Under Tylney, the functions of Master of the Revels gradually became extended to a general censorship of the stage, which in 1624 was put directly in the hands of the lord chamberIain, thus leading to the licensing act of 1737 (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Drama).</hi></p><p>See E. K. Chambers, <hi rend="italic">The Mediaeval Stage</hi> (1904); and his <hi rend="italic">Notes on the History of the Revets Office under the Tudors</hi> (1906), with authorities quoted.</p>
