fru <hi rend="italic">tex,</hi> a little, low, dwarf tree, or a woody vegetable, of a ſize leſs than a tree ; and which, inſtead of one ſingle stem, frequently from the ſame root puts forth ſeveral ſets or ſtems. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Plant</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Tree.</hi> Such are privet, phillyrea, holly, box, honey- ſuckle, &amp; c. Shrubs and trees put forth in autumn a kind of buttons, or gems, in the axis of the leaves ; theſe buttons are as ſo many little ova, which, coming to expand by the warmth of the following ſpring, open into leaves and flowers. By this, together with the height, ſome diſtinguiſh ſhrubs from s <hi rend="italic">uffrutices,</hi> or under ſhrubs, which are low buſhes, that do not put forth any of theſe buttons, as ſage, thyme, &amp; c.</p><p>The two hardſeſt ſhrubs we are poſſessed of are the ivy and box ; theſe ſtand the ſeverity of our ſharpeſt winters unhurt, while other ſhrubs periſh, and trees have their ſolid bodies ſplit and torn to pieces. In the hard winter of the year 1683, theſe two ſhrubs ſuffered no injury any where ; though the yews and hollies, which are generally ſuppoſed very hardy, were that winter in ſome places killed, and in others ſtripped of their leaves, and damaged in their bark. Furze-buſhes were found to be ſomewhat hardier than theſe, but they ſometimes periſhed, at leaſt down to the root. The broom ſeemed to occupy the next ſtep of hardineſs beyond theſe. This lived where the others died, and where even this died, the juniper ſhrubs were ſometimes found unhurt. This laſt is the only ſhrub that approaches to the hardineſs of the box and ivy, but even it does not quite come up to them ; for while they ſuffer nothing in whatever manner they are exposed, the juniper, though it bears cold well under the ſhelter of other trees, yet cannot bear the viciſſitudes of heat and cold ; inſomuch that ſome juniper ſhrubs were found half dead and half vigorous ; that side which faced the mid-day fun having periſhed by the ſucceſſive thawings and freezings of its ſap ; while that which was not expoſed to the viciſſitudes of heat had born the cold perfectly well. Such ſhrubs as are not hardy enough to defy the winter, but appear half dead in the ſpring, may often be recovered by Mr Evelyn’s method of beating their branches with a ſlender hazel-wand, to ſtrike off the withered leaves and buds, and give a free paſſage to the air to the internal parts. Where this fails, the method is to cut them down to the quick, and if no part of the trunk appears in a growing condition, they muſt be taken off down to the level of the ground.
