For this purpoſe he addreſſed himſelf to Antonia, the daughter of Anthony the triumvir, the widow of Druſus, and the mother of Germanicus. When this illuſtrious woman, who was honoured by the court and revered by the people, heard the particulars, ſhe ſent diſpatches to the emperor by one of her ſlaves. Tiberius was aſtoniſhed, but not diſmayed. The danger preſſed ; his habitual ſlowneſs was out of ſeaſon ; the time called for vigour and deciſive meaſures. He ſent Macro to Rome, with a ſpecial commiſſion to take upon him the command of the praetorian guards. He added full inſtructions for his conduct in all emergencies. Early in the morning on the 15th, before the kalends of November, a report was ſpread, that letters had arrived at Rome, in which the emperor ſignified his intention to aſſociate Sejanus with himſelf in the tribunitian power. The ſenate was ſummoned to meet in the temple of Apollo, near the imperial palace. Sejanus attended without delay. A party of the praetorians followed him. Macro met him in the veſtibule of the temple. He approached the miniſter with all demonſtrations of profound reſpect, and taking him aſide, “ Be not ſurpriſed (he ſaid) that you have no letter from the prince : it is his pleaſure to declare you his colleague in the tribunitian power ; but he thinks that a matter of ſo much importance ſhould be communicated to the lathers by the voice of the conſuls. I am going to deliver the emperor’s orders.” Sejanus, elated with joy, and fluffed with his new dignity, entered the ſenate-houſe ; Macro followed him. As soon as the conſuls arrived, he delivered the letter from Tiberius, and immediately went forth to the praetorian guards. He informed them, that by order of the prince, a large donative was to be diſtributed among the ſoldiers. He added, that, by a new commiſſion, he himſelf was appointed their commanding officer ; and, if they followed him to the camp, they would there receive the promiſed bounty. The lure was not thrown out in vain : the praetorian guards quitted their ſta- tion. Laco, who ſtood near at hand, immediately ſurrounded the ſenate-houſe with a body of the city cohorts.</p><p>The letter to the conſuls was confuſed, obſcure, and tedious, only glancing at Sejanus, till at laſt the language of invective left no room for doubt. Sejanus kept his ſeat like a man benumbed, ſenſeleſs and ſtupid with aſtoniſhment. His friends, who a little before congratulated him on his new dignity, deſerted him on every side. He was commanded by the conſul to rise and follow him, and being loaded with irons, was conducted to priſon. His downfal filled the city with exultation. The populace, who worſhipped him in the hour of proſperity, rejoiced to ſee the sad cataſtrophe to which he was now reduced. They followed in crowds,</p><p>rending the air with ſhouts, and pouring forth a torrent of abuſe and ſcurrilous language. The priſoner endeavoured to hide his face ; but the mob delighted to ſee remorſe and ſhame and guilt and horror in every feature of his distracted countenance. Thev reviled him for his acts of cruelty ; they laughed at his wild ambition ; they tore down his images, and daſhed his ſtatues to pieces. He was doomed by Tiberius to ſuffer death on that very day ; but, as he had a powerful faction in the ſenate, it was not thought advisable, for the mere formality of a regular condemnation, to hazard a debate. Private orders were given to Macro to diſpatch him without delay ; but the conſul, ſeeing the diſpoſitions of the people, and the calm neutrality of the prætorian guards, judged it best to re-aſſemble the fathers. They met in the temple of Concord. With one voice Sejanus was condemned to die, and the ſentence was executed without delay. He was ſtrangled in the priſon. His body was dragged to the Gemoniæ, and, after every ſpecies of inſult from the populace, at the end of three days was thrown into the Tiber. Such was the tragic end of that ambitious favourite. He fell a terrible example to all, who, in any age or country, may hereafter endeavour by their <hi rend="italic">vices to</hi> rise above their fellow-citizens.</p><p>SEIGNIOR, is, in its general ſignification, the same with <hi rend="italic">lord;</hi> but is particularly uſed for the lord of the fee as of a manor, as sei<hi rend="italic">gneur</hi> among the feudiſts is he who grants a fee or benefit out of the land to another ; and the reaſon is, becauſe having granted away the uſe and profit of the land, the property or dominion he ſtill retains in himſelf.</p><p>SEIGNIORAGE, is a royalty or prerogative of the king, whereby he claims an allowance of gold and ſilver bought in the maſs to be exchanged for coin. As ſeigniorage, out of every pound weight of gold, the king had for his coin 5 s. of which he paid to the maſter of the mint ſometimes 1 s. and ſometiraes 1 s. 6 d. Upon every pound weight of ſilver, the ſeigniorage anſwered to the king in the time of Edward III. was 18 pennyweights, which then amounted to about 1 s. out of which he ſometimes paid 8 d. at others 9 d. to the maſter. In the reign of king Henry V. the king’s ſeigniorage of every pound of ſilver was 15 d. &amp;c.</p><p>SEIGNIORY, is borrowed from the French seign<hi rend="italic">eurie, i. c. dominatus, imperium, principatus;</hi> and signifies with us a manor or lordſhip, s<hi rend="italic">eigniory de sokemans. Seigniory in gross,</hi> ſeems to be the title of him who is not lord by means of any manor, but immediately in his own perſon ; as <hi rend="italic">tenure in capite,</hi> whereby one holds of the king as of his crown, is seign<hi rend="italic">iory in gross.</hi></p><p>SEIKS.
