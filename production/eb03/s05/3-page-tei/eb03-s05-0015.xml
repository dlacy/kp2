The Sphinx had been ſent into the neighbourhood of Thebes by Juno, who wiſhed to puniſh the family of Cadmus, which ſhe persecuted with immortal hatred, and it laid this part of Bœotia under continual alarms, by propoſing enigmas, and devouring the inhabitants if unable to explain them. In the midſt of their conſternation the Thebans were told by the oracle, that the ſphinx would deſtroy herſelf as ſoon as one of the enigmas ſhe propoſed was explained. In this enigma ſhe wiſhed to know what animal walked on four legs in the morning, two at noon, and three in the evening. Upon this Croon king of Thebes promiſed his crown and his ſiſter Jocaſta in marriage to him who could deliver his country from the monſter by a succeſsful explanation of the enigma. It was at laſt happily explained by Œdipus, who obſerved, that man walked on his hands and feet when young, or in the morning of life, at the noon of life he walked erect, and in the evening of his days he ſupported his infirmities upon a stick. <hi rend="italic">(Vid. Oedipus}.</hi> The ſphinx no ſooner heard this explanation than ſhe daſhed her head againſt a rock, and immediately expired. Some mythologiſts wish to unriddle the fabulous traditions about the ſphinx by the ſuppoſition that one of the daughters of Cadmus, or Laius, infeſted the country of Thebes by her continual depredations, becauſe ſhe had been refuſed a part of her father’s poſſeſſions. The lion’s paw expreſſed, as they Obſerve, her cruelty, the body of the dog her laſciviouſneſs, her enigmas the ſnares ſhe laid for ſtrangers and travellers, and her wings the diſpatch ſhe uſed in her expeditions.</p><p>Among the Egyptians the ſphinx was the ſymbol of religion, by reaſon of the obſcurity of its myſteries ; and on the ſame account the Romans placed a ſphinx in the pronaos or porch of their temples. Sphinxes were uſed by the Egyptians to ſhow the beginning of the water’s riſing in the Nile : with this view, as it had the head of a woman and body of a lion, it signified that the Nile began to ſwell in the months of July and Auguſt, when the ſun pasſes through the signs of Leo and Virgo. There are ſeveral of theſe ſtill to be ſeen ; one in particular, near the pyramids, much ſpoken of by the ancients ; being of a prodigious fize, and cut out of the rock ; the head and neck appear only at preſent, the rest of the body being hid in the sand. This, according to Thevenot, is 26 feet high, and 15 feet from the ear to the chin : but Pliny aſſures us, the head was no leſs than 102 feet in circumference, and 62 feet high from the belly, and that the body was 143 feet long, and was thought to be the ſepulchre of king Amaſis.</p><p>The learned Mr Bryant @@* obſerves, that the ſphinx ſeems to have been originally a vaſt rock of different ſtrata ; which, from a ſhapeleſs maſs, the Egyptians faſhioned into an object of beauty and veneration. The Egyptians uſed this figure in their building; from them the Greeks derived it, and afterwards improved it into an elegant ornament. It is alſo frequently uſed in modern architecture.</p><p>It is proper to obſerve, that the ſphinx of the Egyptians is ſaid in the Asiatic Reſearches @@* to have been found in India. Colonel Pearſe was told by Murari Pandit, a man of learning among the Hindoos, that the ſphinx there called s<hi rend="italic">ingh is</hi> to appear at the end of the world, and as ſoon as he is born will prey on an elephant : he is therefore figured ſeizing an elephant in his claws ; and the elephant is made ſmall, to ſhow that the sin<hi rend="italic">gh,</hi> even a moment after his birth, will be very large in proportion to it. But in oppoſition to this account given by Murari Pandit, the late Sir William Jones, the learned and illuſtrious preſident of the Aſiatic Society, was aſſured by ſeveral Brahmans, that the figure taken for a ſphinx was a repreſentation of a lion ſeizing a young elephant. This point therefore requires farther inveſtigation.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sphinx, HAWK</hi><hi rend="italic">-Moth,</hi> in natural hiſtory ; a genus of insects belonging to the order of <hi rend="italic">lepidopierae.</hi> The antennæ are ſhaped somewhat like a priſm, and are more ſlender at each end than at the middle.
