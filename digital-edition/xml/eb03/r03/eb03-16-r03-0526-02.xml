<p><label>ROTHSAY</label>
a town in the iſle of Bute, oſ which it is the capital. It is a well-built town of ſmall houſes, and about 200 families ;· and is within theſe few years much improved. It has a good pier, and is ſeated at the bottom of a fine bay, whoſe mouth lies exactly oppoſite to Loch Steven in Cowal. Here is a fine depth of water, a ſecure retreat, and a ready navigation down the Frith for an export trade. Magazines of goods for foreign parts might be moſt advantageouſly erected here. The women of this town ſpin yarn, the men ſupport themſelves by fiſhing. W. Long. 5.0. N. Lat. 55. 5°∙</p><p>Rothſay gives the title of Duke to the prince of Scotland, a title which was formerly accompanied with ſuitable revenues, powers, and privileges. Of the origin of this title we have the following account ſrom the pen of the learned Dr M <hi rend="sup">t</hi> Leod of Glaſgow. Some time between the 16th of March and the 26th of October 1398, John of Gaunt, who is ſtyled John duke of Aquitaine and Lancaſter, uncle to the king of England, and David, who is ſtyled earl of Carrick, eldeſt ſon of the king of Scotland, met for the purpoſe of ſettling the borders, and terminating all mattere in diſpute. At a ſubſequent interview between the ſame parties, David is ſtyled Duke of Rothſay. “ This innovation probably proceeded on an idea, to which the interview of the two princes might naturally give riſe, that it was unſuitable, and unworthy of the Scottiſh national dignity, that the princes of England ſhould enjoy a title of nobility, which was eſteemed to be of higher rank than that poffeſſed by the hereditary prince of Scotland.” And this, in the opinion of our author, was the occaſion of introducing the title of Duke into Scotland.</p>
