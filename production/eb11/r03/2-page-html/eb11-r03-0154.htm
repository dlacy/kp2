<p><span class="font0">vestment. In the Roman Catholic Church the rochet is a tunic of white, and usually fine linen or muslin (battiste, mull)&nbsp;reaching about to the knee, and distinguished from the surplice&nbsp;by the fact that its arms are narrow and tight-fitting. The&nbsp;lower edge and the sleeves are usually garnished with lace,&nbsp;lined with violet or red silk in the case of prelates, or—more&nbsp;rarely—with embroidered borders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rochet is proper to, and distinctive of, prelates and bishops: but the right to wear it is sometimes granted by the&nbsp;pope to others, especially the canons of cathedral churches.&nbsp;It is not a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vestis sacra,</span><span class="font0"> and cannot therefore be used as a substitute for the surplice, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> in the administering of the Sacraments (Decree of the Congregation of Rites of Jan. io, 1852).&nbsp;None the less, since it is used at choir services and is ordered&nbsp;to be worn over the everyday dress at Mass </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Missa rom. Rit.&nbsp;celebr.</span><span class="font0"> i. 2), it may be included among liturgical vestments in&nbsp;the widest sense.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The earliest notice of the use of the rochet is found in an inventory of the vestments of the Roman clergy, dating from&nbsp;the 9th century. In this it is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">camisia,</span><span class="font0"> a name which it&nbsp;retained at Rome until the 14th century, and it seems to have&nbsp;been already at that time proper to particular members of the&nbsp;clergy. Other Roman names for the vestment were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">succa,&nbsp;sucta',</span><span class="font0"> it was not till the 14th century that the name </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tochetturn&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">appeared at Rome, but it was not long before it had superseded&nbsp;all the native designations. Outside Rome, too, the vestment&nbsp;is early met with, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> in the Frankish empire (9th century) as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">alba Clericalis,</span><span class="font0"> in contradistinction to the liturgical alb, and in&nbsp;England (10th century) under the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oferslip</span><span class="font0"> in the 46th&nbsp;canon of the ecclesiastical laws of Edgar. At the beginning&nbsp;of the 12th century the rochet is mentioned, under the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">camisia,</span><span class="font0"> by Gilbert of Limerick and by Honorius, and, somewhat later, by Gerloh of Reichersperg as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tunica talaris.</span><span class="font0"> From&nbsp;the 13th century onward it is frequently mentioned. The&nbsp;name </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rochettum</span><span class="font0"> is first traceable in England; in Germany and&nbsp;northern France the rochet was also - called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">saroht (sarrotus)</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sarcos (sarcotium).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Outside Rome the rochet was, until well into the 14th century, a vestment common to all the clergy, and especially to those of&nbsp;the lower orders; and so it remained, in general, until the&nbsp;16th century, and even, here and there, so late as the 19th.&nbsp;Moreover, in further contradistinction to the Roman use, it&nbsp;had—especially in the German dioceses—a Hturgical character,&nbsp;being used instead of the surplice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rochet was originally a robe-like tunic, and was therefore girdled, like the liturgical alb. So late as 1260 the provincial&nbsp;synod of Cologne decreed that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vestis Carnisialis</span><span class="font0"> must be&nbsp;long enough entirely to cover the everyday dress. A good&nbsp;example of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">camisia</span><span class="font0"> of the 12th century is the rochet of&nbsp;Thomas Becket, preserved at Dammartin in the Pas de Calais,&nbsp;the only surviving medieval example remarkable for the pleating&nbsp;which, as was the case with albs also, gave greater breadth&nbsp;and more elaborate folds. In the 15th century the rochet only&nbsp;reached half-way down the shin; in the 16th and 17th to the&nbsp;knee; in the 18th and 19th often only to the middle of the thigh.&nbsp;In the middle ages it was always plain. The rochet is unknown&nbsp;in the Eastern Churches.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. Bra.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Church of England.—</span><span class="font0">In the English Church the rochet is a vestment peculiar to bishops, and is worn by them, with the&nbsp;chimere </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> both “ at all times of their ministration ” in&nbsp;church and also on ceremonial occasions outside, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> in the&nbsp;House of Lords or at a royal levee. In general it has retained&nbsp;the medieval form more closely than the Roman rochet, in so far&nbsp;as it is of plain, very fine linen (lawn), and reaches almost to&nbsp;the feet. The main modifications have been in the sleeves.&nbsp;At the time of the Reformation these were still narrow, though&nbsp;already showing a tendency to expand. The portrait of Archbishop Warham at Lambeth, for instance, shows a rochet with&nbsp;fairly wide sleeves narrowing towards the wrists, where they&nbsp;are confined by fur cuffs. This fashion continued until, in the&nbsp;17th century, the sleeves became much fuller; but it was not&nbsp;till the 18th century that they developed into the familiar</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">exaggerated balloon shape, confined at the wrists by a ribbon, beyond which a ruffle projected. About the same period, too,&nbsp;arose the custom of making the rochet sleeveless and attaching&nbsp;the “ lawn sleeves ” to the chimere. This fashion survived&nbsp;throughout most of the 19th century, but there has since been&nbsp;a tendency to revert to the earlier less exaggerated form, and&nbsp;the sleeves have been reattached to the rochet. The ribbon&nbsp;by which the wrist is confined is black, except when convocation robes are worn, when it is scarlet. The rochet is worn&nbsp;without the chimere under the cope by those bishops who&nbsp;use this vestment. At his consecration the bishop-elect is,&nbsp;according to the rubric, presented to the consecrating bishops&nbsp;vested in a rochet only; after the “ laying on of hands ” he&nbsp;retires and puts on “ the rest of the episcopal habit,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;chimere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. A. P.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCHFORD, EARL OF, an English title borne by the family of Nassau de Zulestein from 1695 to 1830. WilHam Henry&nbsp;Nassau de Zulestein (1645-1709) was born at Zuylestein, near&nbsp;Utrecht, his father being Frederick Nassau de Zulestein (1608-1672), a natural son of IIenry Frederick, prince of Orange, and&nbsp;his mother an English lady, Mary Killegrew. One of the most&nbsp;trusted companions of his kinsman, William of Orange, ZuIe-stein was sent to England in 1687 and again in 1688 to report&nbsp;on the condition of affairs, and later in 1688 he sailed with&nbsp;the prince on his famous expedition. After the Revolution he&nbsp;was naturalized and served the king in the field, being created&nbsp;Viscount Tunbridge and earl of Rochford in 1695. He was&nbsp;succeeded by his son William (1681-1710), who was killed at&nbsp;the battle of Almenara, and then by another son Frederick&nbsp;(1682-1738). Frederick’s son, William Henry, the 4th earl&nbsp;(1717-1781), was a diplomatist and a statesman. Having&nbsp;gained experience as envoy at Turin from 1749 to 1753, he was&nbsp;ambassador at Madrid from 1763 to 1766 and at Paris from&nbsp;1766 to 1768. From 1768 to 1775 he was one of the secretaries&nbsp;of state. This earl left no children when he died on the 28th&nbsp;of September 1781, and his nephew, William Henry, the 5th&nbsp;earl (1754-1830), dying in September 1830 the earldom became&nbsp;extinct. The estates of the earls of Rochford were in Suffolk&nbsp;and Essex, their principal residence being St Osyth Priory in&nbsp;the latter county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCHFORD, a town in the south-eastern parliamentary division of Essex, England, 39 m. E. by N. from London by&nbsp;the Southend branch of the Great Eastern railway. Pop. (1901)&nbsp;1829. It lies on the small river Roach, near the head of a long&nbsp;estuary. The town has a Perpendicular church (St Andrew),&nbsp;a corn exchange and some agricultural trade. Rochford Hall,&nbsp;a picturesque gabled mansion of various dates, belonged once&nbsp;to the Boleyns, and it has been stated that Anne Boleyn, the&nbsp;unfortunate queen of Henry VIII., was born here, but this is&nbsp;in no way proved. Near Rochford the Lawless or Whispering&nbsp;Court, a remarkable survival of unknown origin, is held by a&nbsp;manorial tenure on the Wednesday following Michaelmas Day,&nbsp;beginning at midnight. No light is permitted, nor may voices&nbsp;be raised above a whisper. Nearly 3 m. N.W. from Rochford&nbsp;is Ashingdon. This is generally accepted as the scene of the&nbsp;fight of Assandun in 1016 between Canute and Edmund Ironside, in which the English were defeated through treachery in&nbsp;their ranks. Earthworks, of this or an earlier date, remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCK, DANIEL (1799-1871), English Roman CathoHc priest and ecclesiologist, was bom at Liverpool on the 31st of August&nbsp;1799, and educated at St Edmund’s College, Ware, Herts, and&nbsp;at the English College, Rome. He was ordained priest in 1824&nbsp;and successively appointed'chaplain to the 16th earl of Shrewsbury at Alton Towers, Staffordshire, and priest in charge of the&nbsp;Roman CathoHc congregation at Buckland, near Faringdon in&nbsp;Berkshire. After the re-estabHshment of the Roman Catholic&nbsp;hierarchy in England, in which he had taken an active part,&nbsp;Rock was elected a canon of St George’s Cathedral, Southwark.&nbsp;He was greatly interested in medieval art, and, having gone to&nbsp;live at South Kensington in 1864, in order to be near the museum,&nbsp;was of great assistance to the authorities there. He died on the&nbsp;28th of November 1871.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
