<p><span class="font0">life which will never end. The Moslems despise the Franks, but not the Frank physician. The caliphs themselves&nbsp;owed much of their fame and their intelligence to the Nazarene doctors, who communicated to them not only the&nbsp;art of healing, but much of the various knowledge of the&nbsp;Greeks. A Frank traveller is suspected ; he is certainly&nbsp;seeking for hidden treasure. But a physician proceeding&nbsp;on the same path is reverenced ; he is a benefactor, not a&nbsp;spoiler ; he is culling simples to form some potent elixir ;&nbsp;he has adopted the nobler part of the wonder-working art,&nbsp;not the secret of finding or making gold, but the mystery&nbsp;of prolonging life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the physician enables the missionary to gain immediate access to the hearts both of the young and the old, so the teacher, with the approbation of many who are unaware&nbsp;of the changes which he must introduce, is enabled to cut&nbsp;off the sources of error, and to implant the seeds of truth.&nbsp;Why is it that the present generation of idolaters still believe in their monstrous idols ? It is because they have been&nbsp;educated to do so. All these superstitions are attached to&nbsp;the past, and have no other root in the present than what&nbsp;custom and education give them. They already exhibit&nbsp;the symptoms of decay, even with the Pagan education in&nbsp;their favour. An education founded on facts, even though it&nbsp;were not grounded on Christian principles, would unfasten&nbsp;the slight and relaxing hold which they yet retain over the&nbsp;minds of the multitude, and would speedily accelerate their&nbsp;destruction. It is a great improvement which is beginning&nbsp;to be introduced into education, the uniting the acquisition&nbsp;of reading and writing with the practice of some of the manual arts. By this no time is lost, and health is promoted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first of all the arts, and applicable to every condition of society, is the cultivation of the ground. How much would a few simple rules and improved practices alter the&nbsp;external comforts of the tribes amongst whom missionaries&nbsp;are labouring, whilst the improvement of the mind would&nbsp;proceed more rapidly along with the amelioration of their&nbsp;outward condition, and the more abundant supply of their&nbsp;temporal wants. The teacher also who is endeavouring to&nbsp;infuse common elementary knowledge into the minds of the&nbsp;young, has the best practice for obtaining that plainness of&nbsp;speech and simplicity of illustration, which will convey, in&nbsp;a tongue unused to express them, the truths of the gospel&nbsp;to those who are no longer young, but whose minds are still&nbsp;in the state of infancy, retaining the weakness of childhood&nbsp;without its pliancy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is great, hope for the world in this, that an education founded solely upon facts, without reference to opinions, and therefore without open controversy, is calculated to&nbsp;destroy all the roots of error, and, though it cannot change&nbsp;the heart, yet will leave a much wider field for truth than&nbsp;exists at present. The contests between different creeds is&nbsp;in a fair way of being reduced to narrow ground, and to a&nbsp;decisive issue. The only alternative speedily will be between Christianity and no religion ; and, unless belief and&nbsp;hope could be exterminated from the human breast, we&nbsp;need have no doubt as to the general result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The introducing agriculture, and the other manual arts, into missionary establishments, would remedy one difficulty&nbsp;which frequently presents itself in affording employment&nbsp;and maintenance for new converts, who, in quitting their&nbsp;former creed, are often cut off from society and the means&nbsp;ofexistence, and in this way, without a new opening to enable them to provide for their own living, must become a&nbsp;burden and a discredit to the new society with which they&nbsp;have become connected. The amelioration of the soil around&nbsp;missionary stations, and improved methods of culture, would&nbsp;be attended with manifold advantages; it would give a visible&nbsp;reply to the objections of the most sceptical, of what use&nbsp;are missionaries ? It would afford food and employment to&nbsp;those who are in temporary want of both, till new outlets&nbsp;could be found for the new converts, either from the ceasing of persecution against them, or from placing them in situations where their recent change does not excite the same&nbsp;enmity ; and it would form a little colony where Christian&nbsp;habits and Christian maxims prevailed, a moral oasis in the&nbsp;midst of the heathen wilderness. How great a change, </span><span class="font1">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">many missionary stations, would even an acquaintance with&nbsp;the best method of irrigation produce ? There is sunshine to&nbsp;ripen any produce ; all that is required is moisture, and the&nbsp;rock is as ready at the hand of art as at the rod of the prophet, to yield its secret treasure of waters, and to spread as&nbsp;it flows over the sand a profusion of fruits and flowers. It&nbsp;was ow ing to this art that the Arab dominion in Spain owed&nbsp;much of its prosperity and glory. The children of the desert, in their ow<sup>,</sup>n burning regions, had been taught the&nbsp;economy of water ; the same skill which produced a wretched&nbsp;garden in the Sahara, created a paradise in Spain ; and to&nbsp;directing the Streamswhich were descending from the snows&nbsp;of the Alpuxaras, we owe these magic wonders which Madame de Stael could never hear of without her pulse beating faster, “ Les orangers du royaume de Grenade, et les&nbsp;citronniers des rois Maures.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The employment of a few religious artisans, whilst they would tend greatly to the success of a mission, and to its&nbsp;speedier taking root in the soil to which it was transplanted,&nbsp;would, if they were possessed of a missionary spirit, add&nbsp;little to the expenditure. A gardener or practical agriculturist might be expected to do more than maintain himself ; a physician, though so important to the mission, might&nbsp;also, in many instances, detract but little from the funds.&nbsp;These, however, are minor considerations ; for a somewhat&nbsp;liberal expenditure, if judicious, is in the end the wisest&nbsp;economy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A source both of economy and power is to concentrate the efforts that are made ; it may present a more imposing&nbsp;appearance to have a number of stations dotted about in all&nbsp;parts of the world ; but we have the example of the apostles,&nbsp;that the first object is to establish a church, to collect a&nbsp;number of believers, and to form them into a new centre,&nbsp;whence the truth may emanate in every direction around.&nbsp;In war nothing is so frequently fruitless as a victory, and&nbsp;it is the highest art of a commander to improve it to the&nbsp;utmost. In missionary efforts, success might be almost as&nbsp;fruitless, if advantage were not taken of it to the fullest extent, by bringing up additional resources, and completely&nbsp;occupying the ground that was gained. The fate of a battle often depends upon the reserve. One or two additional&nbsp;labourers on the missionary field might often terminate a&nbsp;long series of disappointments by a prosperous result. A&nbsp;little missionary colony would at once transplant Christianity into the region proposed to be ultimately occupied, and&nbsp;the children of the agriculturist or the artisan might form&nbsp;the missionaries of future years, inured to the climate, habituated to the mode of life and thought, and speaking the&nbsp;language with native facility. When a single missionary&nbsp;goes amongst a multitude of heathen, he has the whole tide&nbsp;of sympathy against the sentiments which he endeavours to&nbsp;introduce ; the case is reversed when the heathen youth is&nbsp;brought to the missionary settlement, and placed under the&nbsp;social influence of Christianity and civilization. A small&nbsp;missionary colony would at once commence a Christian&nbsp;church ; it would immediately become sacred ground, “ a&nbsp;place where prayer is wont to be made,” and where He who&nbsp;hears and answers prayer would interfere on their behalf,&nbsp;and would abundantly grant their requests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The missionaries are availing themselves, with much intelligence and activity, of that instrument which is changing the world, the press. The Reformation was occasioned by&nbsp;tracts ; and all other changes since, both religious and political, have been indebted to those swift and efficacious messengers, which, like the winged Hermes of the ancients,</span></p>
