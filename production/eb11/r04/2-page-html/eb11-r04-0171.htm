<p><span class="font2">in August 1756. General John Stanwix built Fort Stanwix here at an expense of £60,000, and the first permanent settlement&nbsp;dates from about this time. In October-November 1768, Sir&nbsp;William Johnson and representatives of Virginia and Pennsylvania met 3200 Indians of the Six Nations here and made&nbsp;a treaty with them, under which, for £10,460 in money and&nbsp;provisions, they surrendered to the crown their claims to what&nbsp;is now Kentucky and West Virginia and the western part of&nbsp;Pennsylvania. Of this cession the part which lay in Pennsylvania was secured by purchase from the Indians for the proprietors Richard and Thomas Penn (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pittsburg).</span><span class="font2"> The&nbsp;fort was* dismantled immediately afterward. After 1776, when&nbsp;it was partly repaired by Colonel Elias Dayton, it was called&nbsp;by the continentals Fort Schuyler, in honour of General Philip&nbsp;Schuyler, and so is sometimes confused with (old) Fort&nbsp;Schuyler at Utica. The third regiment of the New York line&nbsp;under Colonel Peter Gansevoort occupied the fort in April 1777&nbsp;and completed the repairs begun in 1776; on the 3rd of August&nbsp;in the same year (one month before the official announcement&nbsp;by Congress of the design of the flag) the first flag of the&nbsp;United States, made according to the enactment of the 14th&nbsp;of June and used in battle, was raised here: it was made from&nbsp;various pieces of cloth. On the 2nd of August an advance&nbsp;party of Colonel Barry St Leger’s forces coming from the west&nbsp;arrived before the fort, and the main body (altogether about&nbsp;650 whites, including loyalists—the Royal Greens—under Sir&nbsp;John Johnson, and more than 800 Indians, some led by Joseph&nbsp;Brant) arrived soon afterwards. The fort then contained about&nbsp;750 men under Colonel Gansevoort, with Lieut.-Colonel Marinus&nbsp;Willett as second in command. The danger to the fort roused&nbsp;General Nicholas Herkimer to gather a force of between 700 and&nbsp;1000 men (including some „Oneida Indians), who during their&nbsp;advance on the 6th of August were ambuscaded in a ravine&nbsp;near Oriskany </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font2"> about 8 m. E. of the fort; after heavy&nbsp;losses to both sides, about 250 men from the fort under Willett&nbsp;attacked the camp of the Indians who were supporting&nbsp;St Leger, thus relieved Herkimer through the falling back&nbsp;of the British and Indians to save their supplies, captured&nbsp;five ensigns of the Royal Greens, and seized large quantities&nbsp;of stores from the enemy’s camp. The siege now lost force,&nbsp;the Indians straggled away after the loss of their camp&nbsp;supplies, and on the 23rd of August, St Leger, hearing exaggerated reports of the immediate approach of large reinforcements under General Benedict Arnold, withdrew,&nbsp;abandoning his camp and stores. The successful resistance&nbsp;here to St Leger contributed greatly to the American success&nbsp;at Saratoga. Fort Stanwix was the headquarters of Colonel&nbsp;Gozen Van Schaick (1736-1789) in 1779 when he destroyed&nbsp;the Onondaga villages. At the fort, on the 22nd of October&nbsp;1784, a treaty was made by Oliver Wolcott, Richard Butler and&nbsp;Arthur Lee, commissioners for the United States, with the&nbsp;chiefs of the Six Nations. In 1796 a canal was built across the&nbsp;old portage between Wood Creek and the Mohawk river. In&nbsp;1796 the township of Rome was formed, receiving its name,&nbsp;says Schoolcraft, “ from the heroic defence of the republic&nbsp;made here.” The village of Rome, in the centre of the township,&nbsp;was incorporated in 1819; and Rome was chartered as a city&nbsp;in 1870.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROMÉ DE LTSLE, JEAN BAPTISTE LOUIS (1736-1790), French mineralogist, was born on the 26th of August 1736 at&nbsp;Gray, in Haute-Saône. As secretary of a company of artillery&nbsp;he visited the East Indies, and was .taken prisoner by the&nbsp;English in 1761 and held in captivity for three years. Subsequently he became distinguished for 1rs researches on mineralogy&nbsp;and crystallography. He was the author of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Essai de Cristallographie</span><span class="font2"> (1772), the second edition of which, regarded as his&nbsp;principal work, was published as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Crislallographie</span><span class="font2"> (3 vols, and&nbsp;atlas, 1783). He died at Paris on the 7th of March 1790.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROMESH CHANDRA MITRA, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir</span><span class="font2"> (1840-1899), Indian judge, was born in 1840. When the East India Company’s&nbsp;charter was renewed in 1853, the old supreme courts and sadr&nbsp;courts in the presidency towns were changed into high courts,&nbsp;and Roma Prasad Roy, son of the great reformer Raja Ram&nbsp;Mohan Roy, was the first Indian who was appointed a judge&nbsp;of the new high court of Calcutta. He did not live, however,&nbsp;to take his seat on the bench, and was succeeded by Sambhu&nbsp;Nath Pandit, and then by Dwarka Nath Mitra, perhaps the&nbsp;most talented judge that India produced in the 19th century.&nbsp;Dwarka Nath’s great ability and thorough insight into cases&nbsp;were universally recognized in India; his decisions were&nbsp;valued and often quoted; and his name was often mentioned&nbsp;as an illustration of the judicial capacity of the natives of India.&nbsp;Anukul Chandra Mukerji also sat on the bench for a time;&nbsp;and on his death in 1871, Romesh Chandra Mitra was appointed&nbsp;judge in his place. He maintained the high reputation of his&nbsp;predecessors, and for a period of nearly twenty years, down to&nbsp;1890, he performed his judicial duties with credit and distinction.&nbsp;When the post of chief justice was temporarily vacant in 1882,&nbsp;the marquis of Ripon, then viceroy of India, appointed Romesh&nbsp;Chandra to officiate in that post—the highest judicial position&nbsp;in the Indian empire. Lord Dufferin, who succeeded Lord&nbsp;Ripon as viceroy of India, appointed Romesh Chandra a&nbsp;member of the Public Service Commission, and in this capacity&nbsp;he did valuable work. Failing health compelled him to retire&nbsp;from the high court in 1890, and he was then knighted and&nbsp;appointed a member of the viceroy’s legislative council. Till&nbsp;he died in 1899, he continued to take interest in all social,&nbsp;educational and political reforms in India.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROMFORD, a market town in the Romford parliamentary division of Essex, England; on the small river Rom, which&nbsp;flows into the Thames; 12j m. E.N.E. from London by the&nbsp;Great Eastern railway. Pop. of urban district (1901) 13,656.&nbsp;The ancient church of St Edward the Confessor was replaced&nbsp;in 1850 by a structure in Decorated style. There is a large&nbsp;brewery in the town, and extensive market gardens in the&nbsp;neighbourhood. A grant of a market was obtained in 1247,&nbsp;and this is still of importance as regards both cattle and corn.&nbsp;Romford was included in the liberty of Havering-atte-Bower,&nbsp;which until 1892 had a jurisdiction of its own distinct from&nbsp;that of the county, with a high steward, magistrates, clerk of&nbsp;the peace, coroner and quarter sessions. The name of Bower&nbsp;was derived from a queen’s residence attached to the ancient&nbsp;royal hunting-lodge in the vicinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The fact that Romford </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">{Rumford, Rompfordf</span><span class="font2"> lies on the high road between Colchester and London has determined its&nbsp;history. Bronze implements have been found here, but no&nbsp;notice of Romford occurs till the 12th century. It was included in the liberty of Havering, and the chief business of the&nbsp;liberty was conducted there. But the corporation which is&nbsp;mentioned in medieval records is not that of the town of Romford, but of the liberty of Havering. Romford has only had a&nbsp;separate constitution since a local board of health was formed&nbsp;in 1894, under the act of 1875, after the abolition of the liberty&nbsp;in 1892. In the middle ages Romford was rather a meeting-place for merchants than an industrial centre. Brewing,&nbsp;however, is mentioned in 1331, and one tanner at least carried&nbsp;on business in Hare Street in 1467.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROMILLY, JOHN ROMILLY, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ist Baron</span><span class="font2"> (1802-1874), English judge, was the second son of Sir Samuel Romilly, and was&nbsp;born on the 10th of January 1802. He was educated at&nbsp;Trinity College, Cambridge, and was called to the bar at Gray’s&nbsp;Inn in 1827. He first entered parliament in 1832 as member&nbsp;for Bridport, and in 1843 he became a queen’s counsel. He&nbsp;was elected M.P. for Devonport in 1847, and was appointed&nbsp;solicitor-general in 1848 in Lord John Russell’s administration&nbsp;and attorney-general in 1850. In 1851 he was appointed&nbsp;master of the rolls, and continued to sit for Devonport till the&nbsp;general election in 1852, when he was defeated. He was the&nbsp;last master of the rolls to sit in parliament. Romilly was&nbsp;raised to the peerage as Baron Romilly of Barry </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font2">1866, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
