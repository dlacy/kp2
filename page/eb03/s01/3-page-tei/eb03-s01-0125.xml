The inſtitution is evidently of the firſt importance; and if properly encouraged muſt have a very favourable effect on the morals of the people, as it tends not only to preſerve the children of the poor from ſpending Sunday in idleneſs, and of conſequence in diſſipation and vice, but enables them to lay in for the conduct and comfort of their future life a ſtock of uſeful knowledge and virtuous principles, which, if neglected in early life, will ſeldom be ſought for or obtained amidſt the hurry of buſineſe and the cares and temptations of the world.</p><p>The excellent founder of Sunday-ſchools was Mr Raikes, a gentleman of Glouceſterſhire, who, together with Mr Stock, a clergyman in the ſame county, and who, we believe, was equally inſtrumental in the buſineſs with Mr Raikes, ſhewed the example, and convinced many of the utility of the plan. From Glouceſterſhire the inſtitution was quickly adopted in every county and almoſt every town and pariſh of the kingdom; and we have only further to remark on a plan ſo generally known, ſo much approved, and ſo evidently proper, that we hope men of eminence and weight will always be found ſufficiently numerous and willing to beſtow their time and countenance in promoting it to the utmoſt of their power.</p><p>SCHOONER, in ſea-language, a ſmall veſſel with two maſts, whoſe main-ſail and fore-ſail are fuſpended from gaffs, reaching from the mail towards the ſtern, and ſtretched out below by booms, whoſe foremoſt ends are hooked to an iron, which claſps the maſt ſo as to turn therein as upon an axis, when the after-ends are ſwung from one fide of the veſſel to the other.</p><p>SCHORL, a precious ſtone of the ſecond order, of which the varieties are, <hi rend="italic">Siberian,</hi> ruby-coloured, reddiſh, green, brown, blue and black; <hi rend="italic">mother of emerald,</hi> dark green; <hi rend="italic">lapis crucifer,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">croſs ftone;</hi> bar ſchorl; horn blend, black, green, or blue; <hi rend="italic">Cianite, </hi>blue ſchorl; <hi rend="italic">Thumstein; Laxman's quadrangular ſchorl.</hi></p><p>Tranſparent ſchorl is chryſtallized in polygonal prisms, generally with four, fix, or nine ſides; ſome of them are ſo fine as to paſs for gems of the firſt order, especially for the emerald. In the ſemitranſparent ſchorls there are likewiſe ſome of great beauty, as the ruby-coloured, lately diſcovered in Siberia by counſellor Her. man, in a bed of reddiſh argilla, mixed with fragments of felt ſpath, quartz, and mica, on a low granite mountain. The bed of argilla is evidently produced by the decompoſition of granite; which operation Herman ſuppoſes muſt have ſet at liberty the ruby ſchorl formerly pent up in the chinks or fiſſures of the decompoſed part of the mountain. The diſcovery is quite new, no ſuch ſpecies being before known, as it is as hard as the firſt order of precious ſtones, the diamond excepted, takeſ a fine poliſh, and equals in colour the oriental ruby, though not in tranſparency.</p><p>Its ſtructure is made up of fine cylindric columns, like needles collected into bundles or treſſes, lying one on another in different directions, whilſt each individual column is made up of fine plates or laminæ, like the gems. It is fuſible <hi rend="italic">per ſe</hi> into a white tranſparent glaſs, and melts imperfectly with borax when calcined, as it does with microcoſmic ſalt and mineral alkali, into a ſmall vitreous globe, with little ſpots of a white enamel colour. Acids have no effect upon it, even when calcined. Laſtly, it loſes its colour in the fire, after having firſt turned blue. The mother of emeralds is likewiſe a ſemitranſparent ſchorl, in the opinion of ſome able naturaliſts, although Mr Born aſſerts it to be a jade, we know not upon what authority.</p><p>The ſtructure of the ſemitranſparent ſchorls, and ſome of the tranſparent that are not ſo perfectly diaphanous as to conceal their texture, is obſcurely ſparry; but that of the opaque is either filamentous, like aſbeſtos, or hard and brittle like threads of glaſs, or it is compoſed of ſcales. Of this laſt kind is that called <hi rend="italic">horn blend,</hi> which is generally green or black; but there is a beautiful variety of it found on the mount St Gothard, in Switzerland, of a fine ſky-blue colour covered with ſilver talk. Bar ſchorl has been found on the Carpathian mountains chryſtallized in priſms. Lapis crucifer, or the croſs ſtone, is found ſometimes near Brazil in Switzerland, and there named Tauffstein, or chriſtening ſtone; but oftener at Thum in Saxony, and therefore named there Thurnſtein. It is a ſchorl in form of a croſs: that of Brazil conſiſts of two hexagonal chryſtals. The exact cryſtallization of the other is unknown to us.</p><p>Moſt countries produce ſchorls. Ruſſia is particularly rich in ſchorls. It is even difficult to point out all the different places of the empire which produce them; but we ſhall take notice of thoſe moſt remarkable, particularly new diſcoveries. The ruby-coloured ſchorl mentioned above was found by Mr Herman at Sara- poulſky, a village in the government of Perm, ten verſts from Mourſinſky Slabode, in Siberia. The Siberian inſpector, Mr Laxman, has lately diſcovered in the mountain Alpeſtria, on the river Sleudenka near the lake Baikal, the following new ſchorls. Firſt, a green tranſparent ſchorl, of ſo brittle a nature as not to bear carriage without breaking into ſmall pieces truncated. Pallas is poſitive in declaring this dark green ſchorl a hyacinth. This laſt has often ſome of the ſmall yellowiſh white garnets flicking in it, deſcribed in the arti-</p></body></text></TEI>
