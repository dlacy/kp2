<p><span class="font0">promenades. It is the seat of a bishop, and had, in 1836,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">11,473 inhabitants, who make linen cloth, cotton goods, serges, and cassimeres, glass, brandy, and leather ; and trade in wine, brandy, nut-oil, and flax-seed, by the river. Long.&nbsp;3. 1. 45. E. Lat. 45. 54. 30. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIOSECO, a partido, in the province of Valladolid, in Spain, the capital of which, of the same name, but with the&nbsp;prefix sometimes of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Medina del,</span><span class="font0"> is a large city. There is&nbsp;a canal from it which unites the canal of Campo with that&nbsp;of Castille. It contains three churches, five monasteries,&nbsp;two hospitals, 1200 houses, and betwixt 8000 and 9000 inhabitants, who manufacture serges and some other woollen&nbsp;goods, and ribbons and other silk goods. There are two&nbsp;fairs held annually, w<sup>r</sup>hich were places of vast resort, but&nbsp;had declined, till of late years they have revived, and are&nbsp;again become of great importance to the place. There&nbsp;is also a town of the same name in the district of Rey-nosa and province of Toro, in a mountainous part of the&nbsp;country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIOU’S Island, or Rooahoooa, in the Pacific Ocean, about twenty-four miles in circumference, discovered in&nbsp;1792 by Lieutenant Hergest. It is barren and rocky.&nbsp;Long. 139. 9. W. Lat. 8. 54. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIPEN, or more properly Ribe, is a sea-port town and capital of the district of Ribe, in the province of North&nbsp;Jutland, Denmark, and is situated on the river Nipsaae,<sub>&nbsp;</sub>which here falls into the North Sea. The harbour is difficult of access, and admits only of small vessels. There is&nbsp;a castlc, two colleges, and a public library ; but the principal&nbsp;building is the cathedral, which is a handsome structure,&nbsp;and contains many of the tombs of the kings of Denmark.&nbsp;The bishopric is the most ancient, not only of Denmark, but&nbsp;also of Sweden and Norway. The town carries on a considerable trade in linen ; and it also exports corn, horses,&nbsp;and cattle. The population in the year 1834 amounted to&nbsp;2365.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIPHCEAN Mountains are a chain of high mountains in Russia, to the north-east of the river Oby, where there are said to be the finest sables of the whole empire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIPLEY, a market-town of the west riding of the county of York, 215 miles from London and four from&nbsp;Knaresborough, in the wapentake of Claro. It is situated&nbsp;on the river Nyd, over which is a stone bridge. It was&nbsp;formerly a place of some importance, having a large castle,&nbsp;the ruins of which still exist. The church is an ancient&nbsp;building, with many monuments. It is remarkable from&nbsp;the extensive cultivation of liquorice. The market is on&nbsp;Friday, but has been but little attended of late years. The&nbsp;population amounted in 1801 to 892, in 1811 to 880, in&nbsp;1821 to 1282, and in 1831 to 1219 ; but in the parish are&nbsp;included other two townships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIPON, a city of the west riding of Yorkshire, 222 miles from London. It is situated between two small&nbsp;streams, the Ure and the Skell. A new diocese has been&nbsp;erected, and the first bishop of Ripon, Dr Longley, was&nbsp;consecrated in 1836. The cathedral, formerly the collegiate church, has a dean, a subdean, four prebendaries,&nbsp;and two vicars. It is a fine old building, recently placed&nbsp;in good order. It was once adorned with two steeples, one&nbsp;of which was blown down, and the other has been removed. The market-place is one of the finest in the north of&nbsp;England, and is well attended on Thursdays. Ripon was&nbsp;once celebrated for making spurs, but that trade has vanished. Cotton-mills have been erected, which afford more employment. The municipal government consists of a mayor,&nbsp;four aldermen, and eleven councillors. The population&nbsp;amounted in 1821 to 4563, and in 1831 to 5080. Near to&nbsp;it is the magnificent seat and grounds of Studley Royal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RISIBLE, any thing capable of exciting laughter. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ludicrous</span><span class="font0"> is a general term, signifying, as may appear from its derivation, what is playsome, sportive, or jocular. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ludi-</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">crous</span><span class="font0"> therefore seems the genus, of which </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">risible</span><span class="font0"> is a species, limited to what makes us laugh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">However easy it may be, concerning any particular object, to say whether it be risible or not, it seems difficult, if at all practicable, to establish any general character, by&nbsp;which objects of that kind may be distinguished from others.&nbsp;Nor is that a singular case ; for, upon a review, we find&nbsp;the same difficulty in most of the articles already handled.&nbsp;There is nothing more easy, viewing a particular object,&nbsp;than to pronounce that it is beautiful or ugly, grand or&nbsp;little ; but were we to attempt general rules for ranging&nbsp;objects under different classes according to these qualities,&nbsp;we should be much gravelled. A separate cause increases&nbsp;the difficulty of distinguishing risible objects by a general&nbsp;character : all men are not equally affected by risible objects, nor the same man at all times ; for in high spirits a&nbsp;thing will make him laugh aloud, which will scarcely provoke&nbsp;a smile in a grave mood. Risible objects, however, are circumscribed within certain limits. No object is risible but&nbsp;what appears slight, little, or trivial ; for we laugh at nothing&nbsp;that is of importance to our own interest or to that of others.&nbsp;Real distress raises pity, and therefore cannot be risible ;&nbsp;but a slight or imaginary distress, which moves not pity, is&nbsp;risible. The adventure of the fulling-mills in Don Quixote is extremely risible ; so is the scene where Sancho, in&nbsp;a dark night, tumbling into a pit, and attaching himself to&nbsp;the side by hand and foot, hangs there in terrible dismay&nbsp;till the morning, when he discovers himself to be within a&nbsp;foot of the bottom. A nose remarkably long or short is&nbsp;risible ; but to want it altogether, so far from provoking&nbsp;laughter, raises horror in the spectator. With respect to&nbsp;works both of nature and art, none of them is risible but&nbsp;such as are out of rule; some remarkable defect or excess, a very long visage, for example, or a very short one.&nbsp;Hence nothing just, proper, decent, beautiful, proportioned, or grand, is risible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even from this slight sketch it will be readily conjectured, that the emotion raised by a risible object is of a nature so singular as scarcely to find place while the mind is occupied with any other passion or emotion ; and the conjecture is verified by experience ; for we scarcely ever find that&nbsp;emotion blended with any other. One emotion we must&nbsp;except ; and that is, contempt raised by certain improprieties : every improper act inspires us with some degree of&nbsp;contempt for the author ; and if an improper act be at the&nbsp;same time so risible as to provoke laughter, of which blunders&nbsp;and absurdities are noted instances, the two emotions of&nbsp;contempt and of laughter unite intimately in the mind, and&nbsp;produce externally what is termed a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">laugh of derision</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of&nbsp;scorn.</span><span class="font0"> Hence objects that cause laughter may be distinguished into two kinds : they are either </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">risible</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ridiculous.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">A risible object is mirthful only ; a ridiculous object is both&nbsp;mirthful and contemptible. The first raises an emotion of&nbsp;laughter that is altogether pleasant : the pleasant emotion&nbsp;of laughter raised by the other is blended with the painful&nbsp;emotion of contempt, and the mixed emotion is termed&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the emotion of ridicule.</span><span class="font0"> The pain which a ridiculous object&nbsp;gives me is resented and punished by a laugh of derision.&nbsp;A risible object, on the other hand, gives me no pain ; it is&nbsp;rendered altogether pleasant by a certain titillation, which is&nbsp;expressed externally by mirthful laughter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RITE, among divines, denotes the particular manner of celebrating divine service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RITORNELLO, or Repeat, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Music,</span><span class="font0"> the burden of a song, or the repetition of the first or other verses of a song&nbsp;at the end of each couplet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RITUAL, a book directing the order and manner to be observed in performing divine service in a particular church,&nbsp;diocese, or the like. The ancient heathens had also their&nbsp;rituals, which contained their rites and ceremonies to be&nbsp;observed in building a city, consecrating a temple or altar,</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
