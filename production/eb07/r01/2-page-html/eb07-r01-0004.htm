<p><span class="font2">his letters, where certainly a light or ribald mind was most likely to have shown itself, there is nothing to be found unworthy of the scholar and the churchman. These facts are&nbsp;utterly inconsistent with the charges of buffoonery, immorality, and irreligion, which are usually coupled with his&nbsp;name ; and who can doubt, that, had his life given any warrant for such charges, there were jealous enemies enough to&nbsp;have placed the fact beyond the uncertainty of mere assertion ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In common with the other great assailants of religious abuses, Rabelais was branded with the names of heretic and&nbsp;atheist, and the Dedication of the Fourth Book of his Romance makes an indignant allusion to the circumstance.&nbsp;Epithets like these, however, he could well afford to share&nbsp;with such men as Erasmus, Luther, and Melancthon. Had he&nbsp;escaped them, indeed, there would have heen some cause&nbsp;for wonder ; for, assuredly, the severest blow ever levelled&nbsp;against the Roman Catholic church was the publication of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicle of the Wondrous Deeds of Gargantua and&nbsp;Pantagruel.</span><span class="font2"> The popularity of its form secured it attention,&nbsp;where a formal censure would have been disregarded ; and&nbsp;it was read on every hand with unexampled avidity. Calvin&nbsp;spoke of part of it with asperity, but others of the reformers,&nbsp;penetrating its real spirit, gave it their warmest approval,&nbsp;and Beza’s well-known epigram has long graced every edition of the book.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">“Beyond a doubt,” says Coleridge, “he was among the deepest as well as boldest thinkers of his age. His buffoonery was not merely Brutus’ rough stick, which contained&nbsp;a rod of gold ; it was necessary as an amulet against the&nbsp;monks and bigots. Never was there a more plausible, and&nbsp;seldom, I am persuaded, a less appropriate line, than the&nbsp;thousand times quoted</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Rabelais laughing in bis easy cbair</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">of Mr. Pope. The caricature of his filth and zanyism proves how fully he both knew and felt the danger in which&nbsp;he stood. I could write a treatise in praise of the moral&nbsp;elevation of Rabelais’ work, which would make the church&nbsp;stare, and the conventicle groan, and yet would be the&nbsp;truth, and nothing but the truth. I class Rabelais with the&nbsp;great creative minds of the world, [Homer,] Shakspeare,&nbsp;Dante, Cervantes, &amp;c.” The prevalent coarseness, though&nbsp;this even is not always without its meaning, of Rabelais’&nbsp;great work, makes it repulsive to the mass of readers ; and&nbsp;this it is, probably, which has enabled modern writers to&nbsp;appropriate its thoughts and witticisms with impunity. But&nbsp;the richness of invention, the dramatic force of the characters, the originality and vigour of thought, the wit, the&nbsp;learning, the satire, poignant yet without cynicism, the&nbsp;wise philosophy, and the atmosphere of triumphant joyousness that invests the whole, justify the praises of Coleridge,&nbsp;and will secure its fame, as long as vice remains to be&nbsp;lashed, and folly to be ridiculed, or the love of genial humour,&nbsp;and far-sighted wisdom is not utterly extinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is impossible not to admire the robust and healthy nature of the mind of Rabelais, which, at a time when earnestness was constantly running into extravagant excesses in the persons of the other great reformers of the period, maintained its equipoise, without losing any of its intensity in&nbsp;seizing and grappling with the predominant abuses. Nor is&nbsp;its moral culture less conspicuous, which, in an age when the&nbsp;face of society presented so much to impress a conviction&nbsp;of the farce and hollowness of the world, preserved him, in&nbsp;despite of his acute sense of the absurd, the false, and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">contemptible, as well as of his strong satirical bias, from becoming a morbid and misanthropical reviler of mankind. “ I ask not,” says Coleridge, “ the genius of a Machiavel, a&nbsp;Tacitus, ora Swift; it needs only a worldly experience, and&nbsp;an observing mind, to convince a man of forty, that there&nbsp;is no medium between the creed of misanthropy and that&nbsp;of the gospel.” Which of these, then, was Rabelais ? Most&nbsp;certainly the latter. He hates cant in all its shapes, hypocrisy under all its disguises; tyranny, intolerance, villainy,&nbsp;selfishness, and all its brood of tyrant vices, are hisabhorrence ;&nbsp;mere folly he makes his sport, and he dallies with absurdity&nbsp;with a very wantonness. But he never forgets, that he, the&nbsp;satirist, is himself come of the stock of Adam, or libels heaven, by flying in the face of that nature, which, good or bad,&nbsp;is all that himself and his fellow-men have got to struggle&nbsp;through the world with. He takes life as.it is ; he would fain&nbsp;see it better, and lends a helping hand to make it so. Like&nbsp;his great countryman Beranger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">De Tunivers observant la machine,</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Il </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font4"> voit du mal, et n'aime que le bien.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He detests the evil that is in the world, but he never abandons his faith in the good. His satire is not the angry&nbsp;yelping of a currish nature, the overflow of sour secretions&nbsp;and accumulated bile. Where it is grave, it is the commanding voice of honest indignation ; where jovial, there is&nbsp;a kindliness of tone with it, that makes you like the man,&nbsp;whilst you admire his genius. He is essentially good-natured even in his severest moods ; and this is apparent in&nbsp;the very form of his satire. Its most caustic strokes are&nbsp;given with a merry voice and laughing eye ; and yet, whilst&nbsp;apparently revelling in the most unrestrained ebullitions of&nbsp;mere animal spirits, and licentious fancy, he is covertly&nbsp;stripping sensualism of its enticements, and enforcing the&nbsp;strongest lessons of humility. He possessed, in short, the&nbsp;wisdom of love, which is “ the creed of the gospel,” and this&nbsp;his book testifies in a hundred places. At the same time,&nbsp;its defects are great and manifold, and these cannot be better summed up than in the words of La Bruyère. “ Rabelais is inexcusable in having scattered mere filth throughout his writings. His book is a chimera. It is the face of&nbsp;a beautiful woman with the tail of a serpent, or of some&nbsp;other still more unsightly monster. It is a monstrous jumble&nbsp;of a fine and delicately wrought moral, and of the most offensive grossness. Where it is bad, it is as bad as can be,—&nbsp;the very scum of the world might batten on it ; where it is&nbsp;good, nothing can be more choice or excellent ; it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">can</span><span class="font2"> furnish most dainty fare.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For bibliographical details as to the works of Rabelais, see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Biographie Universelle,</span><span class="font2"> tome xxxvi. A careful memoir of&nbsp;him will be found in Niceron’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires des Hommes Illustres,</span><span class="font2"> and also in Chauffepié’s Supplement to Bayle. Rabelais has been naturalised amongst ourselves, more successfully, perhaps, than any Other foreign writer, by Sir T. Urqu-hart and Motteux’s admirable version of his romance.

The&nbsp;monarch afterwards not only refused to repay him, but even&nbsp;confined him, and endangered his life. Rabirius escaped&nbsp;with difficulty from Egypt; and at his return to Rome he&nbsp;was accused by the senate of having lent money to an African prince for unlawful purposes. He was ably defended&nbsp;by Cicero, and acquitted with difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the age of Augustus, there was a Latin poet of the same name, who wrote a poem on the victory which the emperor had gained over Antony at Actium. Seneca has compared him to Virgil for elegance and majesty ; but Quintilian is not so favourable in judging his poetry.</span></p>
