<p><span class="font0">in the place where they are intended to remain, that the  growth of the roots may not be interfered with ; but when&nbsp;meant to be used for culinary purposes, or as ornamental&nbsp;plants, the seedlings may be transplanted in autumn. The&nbsp;most important use of the plants of this genus is to furnish&nbsp;the medicinal substance rhubarb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is not a little singular, that though this valuable medicine has been in use for centuries, we are still ignorant as to the precise species which yields it. Many endeavours&nbsp;have been made to ascertain this point, both by investigation of the countries from which the commercial rhubarb is&nbsp;brought, and by cultivating the known species and comparing their roots with the rhubarb of the shops, but none of&nbsp;these attempts hitherto has proved successful. Previous&nbsp;to 1732, rhubarb was believed to be yielded by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum&nbsp;rhaponticum,</span><span class="font0"> Linn. This species is distinguished by its&nbsp;leaves being roundish ovate, obtuse, pale green, with a few&nbsp;hairs beneath on the nerves and margins. The footstalks&nbsp;are pale green, striated, channelled above, with rounded&nbsp;edges. The roots are large and thick, much divided, and,&nbsp;like those of most of the other species, reddish brown without, yellow within. It is not found, however, that in cultivated specimens the roots yield a product at all resembling&nbsp;true rhubarb ; and as this species is a native of the wild&nbsp;land to the north of the Caspian Sea, between the Volga&nbsp;and Ural rivers, and not, so far as is known, of the country&nbsp;from which rhubarb is believed to come, the opinion that&nbsp;it is the true rhubarb plant has long been abandoned. It&nbsp;is chiefly this species, or hybrids of it, which is so commonly cultivated in gardens for the sake of the leafstalks,&nbsp;which are used extensively in the spring for making tarts&nbsp;and preserves. They have an agreeable acidity, owing to&nbsp;their containing, like some other plants of the same natural&nbsp;order, a considerable proportion of oxalic acid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1732, some seeds sent to Paris and Chelsea as those of the true rhubarb plant were grown, and found to be&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum undulatum.</span><span class="font0"> This species is distinguished by its&nbsp;leaves being oval, obtuse, extremely wavy, of a dark-green&nbsp;colour, and by the footstalks being downy, blood-red, with&nbsp;the upper edges elevated. It is a native of China and Siberia, and was long cultivated by the Russians in the latter&nbsp;country as true rhubarb. The culture, however, is now&nbsp;abandoned, and it is well known that the roots which it&nbsp;yields are widely different from those of the genuine drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1750, Kaaw Boerhaave obtained some seeds which were said to be those of the true rhubarb ; and on being&nbsp;grown, they produced both </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. undulatum</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. palmatum.</span><span class="font0"> The latter species is distinguished from all the others&nbsp;by its leaves being palmated, with acuminate segments ; and&nbsp;its roots on cultivation have been found by M. Guibour to&nbsp;bear the nearest resemblance, in colour, taste, and smell, to&nbsp;the true rhubarb. It appears, however, from the inquiries&nbsp;of Pallas, that the Bucharian rhubarb merchants knew nothing of such a leaf as that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. palmatam,</span><span class="font0"> and described&nbsp;the true rhubarb plant as having round leaves with waved&nbsp;edges. This has been supposed to come near to another&nbsp;species, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. compactum,</span><span class="font0"> which is also occasionally cultivated in our gardens, but its roots are found to differ from&nbsp;true rhubarb in many particulars. Notwithstanding the&nbsp;doubts raised by Pallas, however, the idea that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. palmatum</span><span class="font0"> is the true rhubarb plant is still extensively entertained, and it has been stated as such in the new edition of the&nbsp;London Pharmacopoeia. It is very doubtful, however, if a&nbsp;decided opinion upon this point is admissible in the present&nbsp;state of our knowledge regarding this subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the state of uncertainty to which these conflicting opinions gave rise as to the origin of rhubarb, the Empress&nbsp;Catherine U. of Russia, in 1790, sent an apothecary of the&nbsp;name of Sievers into Siberia, to endeavour to penetrate into&nbsp;the rhubarb country and ascertain the true plant ; but after&nbsp;four years’ attempts he was ultimately foiled, and returned&nbsp;with no further information than that nothing certain appeared to be known upon the subject</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">More recently the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. Emodi</span><span class="font0"> of Dr Wallich (flΛ. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Australe,</span><span class="font0"> Don), and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. Webbianum,</span><span class="font0"> both natives of the Hima-layah Mountains, have been found to be valuable as purgatives, and the former was supposed to be the true source of Chinese rhubarb ; but Mr Pereira has found that the Hi-malayah rhubarb was quite different from the rhubarb of&nbsp;the shops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It thus appears that the source of true rhubarb is still unascertained ; nor is it at all certain that it is not yielded by more than one species. Professor Royle of King’s College&nbsp;is of opinion, and apparently correctly, that it is obtained&nbsp;in the heart of Thibet, in about 95° east longitude, and&nbsp;35° north latitude, a country into which as yet no scientific botanist has ever penetrated. It is worthy of remark,&nbsp;that this agrees with the statements of Pallas and other&nbsp;travellers, that the Russian rhubarb is gathered on the&nbsp;mountains surrounding Lake Kokonor, and that this is part&nbsp;of what has been assigned by Murray as the native country&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. palmatum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Here, therefore, an excellent subject for investigation is still open ; and it is to be hoped that this desideratum in&nbsp;our knowledge of the botanical materia medica may soon&nbsp;be supplied. Several circumstances however combine to&nbsp;render the attainment of this object difficult. The labour&nbsp;of penetrating into the wild country where the true rhubarb&nbsp;probably grows is not to be overlooked ; and jealousy on&nbsp;the part of the dealers in this profitable article of commerce&nbsp;will likewise lead to much inconvenience. It is said that&nbsp;the trade in Russian rhubarb is monopolized by one Buc-hαrian family, who farm it from the Chinese government ;&nbsp;and it is not improbable that, in order to prevent the establishment of a rival trade elsewhere, they may already have&nbsp;embarrassed the subject, by purposely furnishing as the&nbsp;seeds of true rhubarb, those of different and inferior species. In attempting to ascertain the true officinal species&nbsp;by cultivation, we are likewise met by this difficulty, that&nbsp;the different species hybridise so readily that their distinctive characters are very readily lost. This is very apparent&nbsp;in the rhubarbs cultivated in our gardens, which, though&nbsp;commonly referred to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. rhapontieum,</span><span class="font0"> are in great measure made up of hybrids between that species, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. compactum,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rh. hybridum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though the true rhubarb plant has not been seen by any scientific botanist, we have some interesting information&nbsp;from other travellers respecting its growth and production.&nbsp;The best accounts appear to be those given by Mr Bell in&nbsp;his journey from St Petersburg to Pekin. Sievers, in his&nbsp;attempts to discover the true rhubarb plant, likewise obtained&nbsp;some information respecting it, and the statements of these&nbsp;travellers differ only in some unimportant particulars. It&nbsp;appears that the plant is not made the subject of special&nbsp;culture, but that enough grows spontaneously to keep up&nbsp;the supply of this valuable drug. The marmots, which&nbsp;breed extensively in this country, contribute in a great measure to the propagation of the plant ; for it seems that the&nbsp;seeds germinate almost exclusively on the loose earth&nbsp;turned up by these animals in making their burrows. The&nbsp;natives gather the roots in spring and autumn, and, after removing the cortical part, cut them in small pieces to facilitate the drying. They cut a hole through each piece, and&nbsp;then string them upon a small cord, by which they hang&nbsp;them up to dry on poles or trees, or more commonly about&nbsp;their tents, and occasionally, it seems, upon the horns of&nbsp;their sheep. By this last practice a considerable amount of&nbsp;loss is sustained, as, from the prolonged exposure to moisture, much of the root becomes decayed and useless. According to Sievers, the roots are dried under sheds, out of&nbsp;the rays </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">the sun, and they sometimes take </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">whole year&nbsp;to dry.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
