Cupping-glasses, where they can be applied, answer the same purpose, but not with the same effect. (4) By cauterization with a red-hot iron a live coal, nitrate of silver or carbolic or mineral acid, or by injections of permanganate of potassium, the poison which remains in the wound can be destroyed or neutralized. Ammonia applied to the wound as a wash and rubbed into the neighbouring parts is likewise undeniably of great benefit, especially in less serious cases, since it alleviates the pain and reduces the swelling. (5) Internally, stimulants are to be taken freely ; they do not act as specifics against the virus, but are given to excite the action of the heart, the contractions of which become feeble and irregular, to counteract the physical and mental depression, and to prevent a complete collapse. Brandy, whisky, and ammonia in any of its officinal forms should be taken in large doses and at short intervals. The so-called “snake-stones” can have no other effect than, at the best, to act as local absorbents, and can be of use only in the very slightest cases.</p><p>Snakes are oviparous; they deposit from ten to eighty eggs of an ellipsoid shape, covered with a soft leathery shell, in places where they are exposed to and hatched by moist heat. The parents pay no further attention to them, except the pythons, which incubate their eggs by coiling their body over them, and fiercely defend them. In some families, as many freshwater snakes, the sea snakes, <hi rend="italic">Viperidæ,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crotalidæ,</hi> the eggs are retained in the oviduct until the embryo is fully developed. These snakes bring forth living young, and are called “ovo-viviparous.”</p><p>The order of snakes may be divided into the following sub-orders and families or groups.</p><p>First Sub-order.—Hopoterodontes.</p><p>Small burrowing snakes, with a cylindrical body, which is nearly of the same thickness from its anterior to its posterior extremity, and is covered with smooth polished scales of the same size in its whole circumference. No mental groove. Head small, not distinct from the trunk, with imbricate scale-like scutes. Eye rudimentary. Mouth very narrow, at the lower side of the head, armed with small teeth in one jaw only.</p><p>Family 1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Typhlopidæ.</hi>—Teeth in the upper jaw only.</p><p>Genera : <hi rend="italic">Typhlina, Onychocephalus, Typhlops</hi> (see figs. 6, 7).</p><p>Family 2. <hi rend="smallcaps">Stenostomatidæ.</hi>—Teeth in the lower jaw only.</p><p>Genera : <hi rend="italic">Stenostoma, Siagnodon.</hi></p><p>Second Sub-order.—Ophidii Colubriformes.</p><p>Innocuous snakes.
