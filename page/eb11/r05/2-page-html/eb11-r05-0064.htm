<p><span class="font0">RUDOLSTADT, a town of Germany, capital of the principality of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, and the chief residence of the prince, lies on the left bank of the Saale, 18 m. S.W.&nbsp;of Jena, by the railway Grossheringen-Saalfeld, in one of the&nbsp;most beautiful districts of Thuringia. Pop. (1905) 12,494. The&nbsp;picturesque town is a favourite tourist resort. Besides containing the government buildings of the little principality,&nbsp;Rudolstadt is well provided with schools and other institutions,&nbsp;including a library of 65,000 volumes. The residence of the&nbsp;prince is the Heidecksburg, a palace on an eminence 200 ft.&nbsp;above the Saale, which was rebuilt after a fire in 1735, and&nbsp;contains a picture gallery, a magnificent banqueting hall and a&nbsp;library. The Ludwigsburg, another palace in the town, built in&nbsp;1742, accommodates the natural history collections belonging to&nbsp;the prince. The principal church dates from the end of the&nbsp;15th century and contains tombs and effigies of many former&nbsp;princes. In the Anger, a public park between the town and&nbsp;the river, is the theatre. The Rudolsbad—a handsome hydropathic establishment with a richly decorated interior—lying&nbsp;amidst extensive grounds, is also noticeable. Various memorials&nbsp;in and near the town commemorate the visits of Schiller to the&nbsp;neighbourhood in 1787 and 1788. The industries of the place&nbsp;include the manufacture of porcelain, chocolate and dyestuffs, wool-spinning and bell-founding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The name of Rudolstadt occurs in an inventory of the possessions of the abbey of Hersfeld in the year 800. After passing into the possession of the German kings and then of the rulers&nbsp;of Orlamünde and of Weimar, it came into the hands of the&nbsp;counts of Schwarzburg in 1335. Its civic rights were confirmed&nbsp;in 1404, and since 1599 it has been the residence of the ruling&nbsp;house of Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUDRA (probably from the root </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rud,</span><span class="font0"> “ to howl,” hence “ the howler ”), in Hindu Vedic mythology, a storm god, and father&nbsp;of the Maruts who are frequently called Rudriyas. He shoots&nbsp;tempests at the earth, but is not essentially a malevolent deity,&nbsp;being invoked as a protector of cattle. In the Atharvaveda he&nbsp;is lord of life and death, and in later Hinduism one of the Hindu&nbsp;trinity, the god Siva.</span></p>

It has&nbsp;a strong pungent smell and the leaves have a bitter taste.&nbsp;The plant was much used in medieval and later medicine as a&nbsp;stimulative and irritant drug. It was commonly supposed to&nbsp;be much used by witches. From its association with “ rue,”&nbsp;sorrow, repentance (O. Eng. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hréow,</span><span class="font0"> from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hréowan,</span><span class="font0"> to be sorry&nbsp;for, cf. Ger. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reuen),</span><span class="font0"> the plant was also known as “ herb of&nbsp;grace,” and was taken as the symbol of repentance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUEDA, LOPE DE (i5io?-i5Ó5?), Spanish dramatist, was born early in the 16th century at Seville, where, according&nbsp;to Cervantes, he worked as a metal-beater. His name first&nbsp;occurs in 1554 as acting at Bena vente, and between 1558 and&nbsp;1561 he was manager of a strolling company which visited&nbsp;Segovia, Seville, Toledo, Madrid, Valencia and Córdova. In&nbsp;the last-named city Rueda fell ill, and on the 21st of March&nbsp;1565 made a will which he was too exhausted to sign; he&nbsp;probably died shortly afterwards, and is said by Cervantes to&nbsp;have been buried in Córdova cathedral. He was twice married;&nbsp;first to a disreputable actress named Mariana, who became the&nbsp;mistress of the duke de Medinaceli; and second to Rafaela&nbsp;Angela, who bore him a daughter. His works were issued&nbsp;posthumously in 1567 by Timoneda, who toned down certain&nbsp;passages in the texts. Rueda’s more ambitious plays are&nbsp;mostly adapted from the Italian; in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eufemia</span><span class="font0"> he draws on&nbsp;Boccaccio, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Medora</span><span class="font0"> he utilizes Giancarli’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zingara,</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Armelina&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">he combines Raineri’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Attilia</span><span class="font0"> with Cecchi’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Servigiale,</span><span class="font0"> and in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Los Engañados</span><span class="font0"> he uses </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gl’Ingannati,</span><span class="font0"> a comedy produced by the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Intronati,</span><span class="font0"> a literary society at Siena. These follow the original&nbsp;so closely that they give no idea of Rueda’s talent; but in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pasos</span><span class="font0"> or prose interludes he displays an abundance of riotous&nbsp;humour, great knowledge of low life, and a most happy gift*of&nbsp;dialogue. His predecessors mostly wrote for courtly audiences&nbsp;or for the study; Rueda with his strollers created a taste for&nbsp;the drama which he was able to gratify, and he is admitted&nbsp;both by Cervantes and Lope de Vega to be the true founder&nbsp;of the national theatre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His works have been reprinted by the marquis de la Fuensanta del Valle in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Colección de libros raros ó curiosos,</span><span class="font0"> vols, xxiii. and&nbsp;xxiv.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUEIL, a town of N. France, in the department of Seine-et-Oise, at the W. foot of Mt Valérien, 6 m. W. of Paris by tramway. Pop. (1906) 10,439. Rueil has a church rebuilt under Napoleon&nbsp;III. in exact imitation of a previous church in the Renaissance&nbsp;style, and containing the tombs of the Empress Josephine and&nbsp;her daughter Hortense de Beauharnais. In the 37th century&nbsp;Richelieu built a château which no longer exists. Rueil has&nbsp;important photographic works and manufactures of lime and&nbsp;cement, &amp;c. Close to the town is the château of Malmaison,&nbsp;a building of the 18th century famous as the residence of the&nbsp;empress Josephine. It was afterwards occupied by Maria&nbsp;Christina, queen of Spain, and by the empress Eugénie. In&nbsp;1900 the owner, Daniel Osiris, presented it and the park to the&nbsp;nation; the apartments have been as far as possible restored&nbsp;to the condition in which they were when inhabited by Josephine&nbsp;and Napoleon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUFF, a bird so called from the very beautiful and remarkable frill of elongated feathers that, just before the breeding-season, grow thickly round the neck of the male, who is considerably larger than the female, known as the reeve. In&nbsp;many respects this species, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tringa pugnax</span><span class="font0"> of Linnaeus and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Machetes pugnax of</span><span class="font0"> modern ornithologists, is one of the most&nbsp;singular in existence. The best account is that given in 1813&nbsp;by G. Montagu </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Suppl. Orn. Dictionary),</span><span class="font0"> who seems to have&nbsp;been struck by the peculiarities of the species, and, to investigate&nbsp;them, visited the fens of Lincolnshire, possibly excited thereto&nbsp;by the example of T. Pennant, whose information, collected&nbsp;there in 1769, was of a kind to provoke further inquiry, while&nbsp;Daniel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Rural Sports,</span><span class="font0"> iii. p. 234) had added some other particulars, and subsequently G. Graves in 1816 repeated in the&nbsp;same district the experience of his predecessors.
