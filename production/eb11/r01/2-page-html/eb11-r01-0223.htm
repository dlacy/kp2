<p><span class="font0">although in a strikingly different manner and with far more momentous results for the western world. Martin Luther was&nbsp;beyond doubt the most important single figure in the Protestant&nbsp;revolt. His influence was indeed by no means so decisive and so&nbsp;pervasive as has commonly been supposed, and his attacks on the&nbsp;evils in the Church were no bolder or more comprehensive than&nbsp;those of Marsiglio and Wycliffe, or of several among his contemporaries&nbsp; who owed nothing to his example. Had the&nbsp;German princes not found it to their interests to enforce his&nbsp;principles, he might never have been more than the leader of an&nbsp;obscure mystic sect. He was, moreover, no statesman. He&nbsp;was recklessly impetuous in his temperament, coarse and grossly&nbsp;superstitious according to modern standards. Yet in spite of&nbsp;all these allowances he remains one of the great heroes of all&nbsp;history. Few come in contact with his writings without feeling&nbsp;his deep spiritual nature and an absolute genuineness and&nbsp;marvellous individuality which seem never to sink into mere&nbsp;routine or affectation. In his more important works almost&nbsp;every sentence is alive with that autochthonic quality which&nbsp;makes it unmistakably his. His fundamental religious conception&nbsp; was his own hard-found answer to his own agonized&nbsp;question as to the nature and assurance of salvation. Even if&nbsp;others before him had reached the conviction that the Vulgate’s&nbsp;word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">justitia</span><span class="font0"> in Romans i. 16-17 meant “ righteousness ”&nbsp;rather than “ justice ’’ in a juridical sense, Luther exhibited&nbsp;supreme religious genius in his interpretation of “ God’s&nbsp;righteousness ” (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gerechtigkeit)</span><span class="font0"> as over against the “ good works ’’&nbsp;of man, and in the overwhelming importance he attached to&nbsp;the promise that the just shall live by faith. It was his anxiety&nbsp;to remove everything that obscured this central idea which led&nbsp;him to revolt against the ancient Church, and this conception&nbsp;of faith served, when he became leader of the German Protestants,&nbsp;as a touchstone to test the expediency of every innovation.&nbsp;But only gradually did he come to realize that his source of&nbsp;spiritual consolation might undermine altogether the artfully&nbsp;constructed fabric of the medieval Church. As late as 1516 he&nbsp;declared that the life of a monk was never a more enviable one&nbsp;than at that day. He had, however, already begun to look&nbsp;sourly upon Aristotle and the current scholastic theology, which&nbsp;he believed hid the simple truth of the gospel and the desperate&nbsp;state of mankind, who were taught a vain reliance upon outward&nbsp;works and ceremonies, when the only safety lay in throwing&nbsp;oneself on God’s mercy. He was suddenly forced to take up the&nbsp;consideration of some of the most fundamental points in the&nbsp;orthodox theology by the appearance of Tetzel in 1517. In his&nbsp;hastily drafted Ninety-five Theses he sought to limit the potency&nbsp;of indulgences, and so indirectly raised the question as to the&nbsp;power of the pope. He was astonished to observe the wide&nbsp;circulation of the theses both in the Latin and German versions.&nbsp;They soon reached Rome, and a Dominican monk, Prierius,&nbsp;wrote a reply in defence of the papal power, in an insolent tone&nbsp;which first served to rouse Luther’s suspicion of the theology of&nbsp;the papal Curia. He was summoned to Rome, but, out of&nbsp;consideration for his patron, the important elector of Saxony,&nbsp;he was permitted to appear before the papal legate during the&nbsp;diet of Augsburg in 1518. He boldly contradicted the legate’s&nbsp;theological statements, refused to revoke anything and appealed&nbsp;to a future council. On returning to Wittenberg, he turned to&nbsp;the canon law, and was shocked to find it so completely at&nbsp;variance with his notions of Christianity. He reached the&nbsp;conclusion that the papacy was but four hundred years old.&nbsp;Yet, although of human origin, it was established by common&nbsp;consent and with God’s sanction, so that no one might withdraw&nbsp;his obedience without offence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was not, however, until 1520 that Luther became in a sense the leader of the German people by issuing his three&nbsp;great pamphlets, all of which were published in German as&nbsp;well as in Latin—his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Address to the Christian Nobility of the&nbsp;German Nation,</span><span class="font0"> his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Babylonish Captivity of the Church,</span><span class="font0"> and his&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom of the Christian.</span><span class="font0"> In the first he urged that, since the&nbsp;Church had failed to reform itself, the secular government&nbsp;should come to the rescue. “ The Romanists have with great&nbsp;dexterity built themselves about with three walls, which have&nbsp;hitherto protected them against reform; and thereby is&nbsp;Christianity fearfully fallen. In the first place, when the&nbsp;temporal power has pressed them hard, they have affirmed and&nbsp;maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction over&nbsp;them—that, on the contrary, the spiritual is above the temporal.&nbsp;Secondly, when it was proposed to admonish them from the&nbsp;Holy Scriptures they said, ‘ It beseems no one but the pope&nbsp;to interpret the Scriptures,’ and, thirdly, when they were&nbsp;threatened with a council, they invented the idea that no one&nbsp;but the pope can call a council. Thus they have secretly&nbsp;stolen our three rods that they may go unpunished, and have&nbsp;entrenched themselves safely behind these three walls in order to&nbsp;carry on all the rascality and wickedness that we now see.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He declares that the distinction between the “ spiritual estate,” composed of pope, bishops, priests and monks, as&nbsp;over against the “ temporal estate ’’ composed of princes, lords,&nbsp;artisans and peasants, is a very fine hypocritical invention of&nbsp;which no one should be afraid. “ A cobbler, a smith, a peasant,&nbsp;every man has his own calling and duty, just like the consecrated priests and bishops, and every one in his calling or office&nbsp;must help and serve the rest, so that all may work together for&nbsp;the common good.” After overthrowing the other two walls,&nbsp;Luther invites the attention of the German rulers to the old&nbsp;theme of the pomp of the pope and cardinals, for which the&nbsp;Germans must pay. “ What the Romanists really mean to do,&nbsp;the ‘drunken Germans’ are not to see until they have lost&nbsp;everything. ... If we rightly hang thieves and behead robbers,&nbsp;why do we leave the greed of Rome unpunished ? for Rome is&nbsp;the greatest thief and robber that has ever appeared on earth,&nbsp;or ever will; and all in the holy names of the Church and St&nbsp;Peter.” After proving that the secular rulers were free and in&nbsp;duty bound to correct the evils of the Church, Luther sketches&nbsp;a plan for preventing money from going to Italy, for reducing&nbsp;the number of idle, begging monks, harmful pilgrimages and&nbsp;excessive holidays. Luxury and drinking were to be suppressed, the universities, especially the divinity schools, reorganized, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Apart from fundamental rejection of the papal supremacy, there was little novel in Luther’s appeal. It had all been said&nbsp;before in the various protests of which we have spoken, and&nbsp;very recently by Ulrich von Hutten in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dialogues,</span><span class="font0"> but no&nbsp;one had put the case so strongly, or so clearly, before. In&nbsp;addressing the German nobility Luther had refrained from&nbsp;taking up theological or religious doctrines; but in September 1520 he attacked the whole sacramental system of&nbsp;the medieval Church in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Babylonish Captivity of the Church.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Many reformers, like Glapion, the Franciscan confessor of,&nbsp;Charles V., who had read the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Address</span><span class="font0"> with equanimity if not&nbsp;approval, were shocked by Luther’s audacity in rejecting the&nbsp;prevailing fundamental religious conceptions. Luther says:&nbsp;“ I must begin by denying that there are seven sacraments, and&nbsp;must lay down for the time being that there are only three—&nbsp;baptism, penance and the bread, and that by the court of Rome&nbsp;all these have been brought into miserable bondage, and the&nbsp;Church despoiled of her liberty.” It is, however, in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Freedom&nbsp;of the Christian</span><span class="font0"> that the essence of Luther’s religion is to be&nbsp;found. Man cannot save himself, but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font0"> saved then and there,&nbsp;so soon as he believes God’s promises, and to doubt these is&nbsp;the supreme crime. So salvation was to him not a painful&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">progress</span><span class="font0"> toward a goal to be reached by the sacraments and by&nbsp;right conduct, but a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">state</span><span class="font0"> in which man found himself so soon&nbsp;as he despaired absolutely of his own efforts, and threw himself&nbsp;on God’s assurances. Man’s utter incapacity to do anything&nbsp;to please God, and his utter personal dependence on God’s grace&nbsp;seemed to render the whole system of the Church well-nigh&nbsp;gratuitous even if it were purged of all the “ sophistry ’’ which&nbsp;to Luther seemed to bury out of sight all that was essential in&nbsp;religion. Luther’s gospel was one of love and confidence, not&nbsp;of fear and trembling, and came as an overwhelming revelation&nbsp;to those who understood and accepted it.</span></p>
