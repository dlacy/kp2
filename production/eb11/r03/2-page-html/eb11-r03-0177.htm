<p><span class="font1">be was sent from France on a secret mission to the lords of Galloway. In 1175 he again appears as a negotiator between&nbsp;the king and a number of English religious houses. The interest&nbsp;which Hoveden shows in ecclesiastical affairs and miracles may&nbsp;justify the supposition that he was </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">clerk in orders. This,&nbsp;however, did not prevent him from acting, in 1189, as a justice&nbsp;of the forests in the shires of Yorkshire, Cumberland and&nbsp;Northumberland. After the death of Henry II., it would seem&nbsp;that Hoveden retired from the public service, though not so&nbsp;completely as to prevent him from drawing on the royal archives&nbsp;for the history of contemporary events. About the year 1192&nbsp;he began to compile his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronica,</span><span class="font1"> a gencral history of England&nbsp;from 732 to his own time. Up to the year 1192 his narrative&nbsp;adds little to our knowledge. For the period 732-1148 he&nbsp;chiefly drew upon an extant, but unpublished chronicle, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historia Saxonum sive Anglorum post obilum Bedae</span><span class="font1"> (British&nbsp;Museum MS. Reg. 13 A. 6), which was composed about 1150.&nbsp;From 1148 to 1170 he used the Melrose Chronicle (edited for the&nbsp;Bannatyne Club in 1835 by Joseph Stevenson) and a collection&nbsp;of letters bearing upon the Becket controversy. From 1170-to 1192 his authority is the chronicle ascribed to Benedictus&nbsp;Abbas </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> the author of which must have been in tbe royal&nbsp;household at about the same time as Hoveden. Although this&nbsp;period was one in which Hoveden had many opportunities of&nbsp;making independent observations, he adds little to the text&nbsp;which he uses; except that he inserts some additional documents. Either his predecessor had exhausted the royal archives,&nbsp;or the supplementary searches of Hoveden were languidly&nbsp;pursued. From 1192, however, Hoveden is an independent&nbsp;and copious authority. Like “ Benedictus,” he is sedulously&nbsp;impersonal, and makes no pretence to literary style, quotes&nbsp;documents in full and adheres to the annalistic method. His&nbsp;chronology is tolerably exact, but there are mistakes enough&nbsp;to prove that he recorded events at a certain distance of time.&nbsp;Both on foreign affairs and on questions of domestic policy he&nbsp;is unusually well informed. His practical experience as an&nbsp;administrator and his official connexions stood him in good&nbsp;stead. He is particularly useful on points of constitutional&nbsp;history. His work breaks off abruptly in 1201, though he&nbsp;certainly intended to carry it further. Probably his death&nbsp;should be placed in that year.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROGER OF WENDOVER (d. 1236), English chronicler, was probably a native of Wendover in Buckinghamshire. At some&nbsp;uncertain date he became a monk of St Albans; afterwards&nbsp;he was appointed prior of the cell of Belvoir, but he forfeited&nbsp;this dignity in the early years of Henry III., having been&nbsp;found guilty of wasting the endowments. His latter years&nbsp;were passed at St Albans, where he died on the 6th of May&nbsp;1236. He is the first of the important chroniclers who worked&nbsp;in the scriptorium of this house. His great work, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Flores&nbsp;Histonarum,</span><span class="font1"> begins at the creation and extends to 1235. It&nbsp;is of original value from 1202. Some critics have supposcd,&nbsp;but on inconclusive evidence, that Wendover copied, up to&nbsp;1189, an earlier compilation, the work of John de Cella, the&nbsp;twenty-first abbot of St Albans (1195-1214). Wendover’s&nbsp;work is known to us through one 13th-century manuscript&nbsp;in the Bodleian library (Douce MS. 207), a mutilated 14th-century copy in the British Museum (Cotton MS. Otho B. v.),&nbsp;and the edition prepared by Matthew Paris which forms the&nbsp;first part of that writer’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chronica Majora</span><span class="font1"> (ed. H. R. Luard,&nbsp;Rolls Series, 7 vols.). The best edition of Wendover is that&nbsp;of H. O. Coxe (4 vols., London, 1841-42); there is another&nbsp;(from 1154) in the Rolls Series by H. G. Hewlett (3 vols.,&nbsp;1886-89). Wendover is a copious but inaccurate writer, less&nbsp;prejudiced but also less graphic than Matthew Paris. Where he&nbsp;is the sole authority for an event, he is to be used with caution.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROGERS, HENRY (1806-1877), English Nonconformist divine, was born at St Albans on the 18th of October 1806,&nbsp;and was educated privately and by his father, a surgeon of&nbsp;considerable culture. Rogers was meant to follow his father’s&nbsp;profession, but the reading of John Howc turned him to&nbsp;theology, and after qualifying at Highbury College he accepted&nbsp;a call to the Congregational Church at Poole in 1829. In 1832&nbsp;he was appointed lecturer in logic at Highbury, in 1836&nbsp;professor of English at University College, London, and in&nbsp;1839 professor of English, mathematics and mental philosophy&nbsp;at Spring HiII College, Birmingham. In 1836 appeared his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life and Character of John Howe,</span><span class="font1"> and in 1837 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Christian&nbsp;Correspondent,</span><span class="font1"> a collection of some 400 religious letters&nbsp;“ by eminent persons of both sexes.” His contributions to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh Review</span><span class="font1"> began in 1839 and were collected in&nbsp;volume form in 1850, 1855 and 1874. His most famous&nbsp;book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Eclipse of Faith, or a Visit to a Religions Sceptic,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was published anonymously in 1852 and went through six&nbsp;editions in three years. It drew a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reply</span><span class="font1"> from F. W. Newman,&nbsp;which Rogers answered in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Defence</span><span class="font1"> (1854). Two volumes&nbsp;of imaginary letters, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Selections from the Correspondence of&nbsp;R. E. H. Greyson</span><span class="font1"> (an anagram for his own name), appeared in&nbsp;1857 and show his style at its best. In 1858 he became&nbsp;principal and professor of theology at the Lancashire Independent College, where he edited the works of John Howe&nbsp;(6 vols., 1862-63) <sup>anf</sup>I wrote for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">British Quarterly.</span><span class="font1"> He&nbsp;retired in 1871, and died at Machynlleth, on the 21st of&nbsp;August 1877. Rogers was widely read, and as a Christian&nbsp;apologist carried on the traditions of the 18th century as&nbsp;illustrated by Butler.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROGERS, HENRY DARWIN (1808-1866), American geologist, was born at Philadelphia on the ist of August 1808. At the&nbsp;age of twenty-one he was chosen professor of chemistry and&nbsp;natural philosophy at Dickinson College, Pennsylvania. After&nbsp;holding this post for three years, he went to Europe and took&nbsp;up the study of geology. Subsequently be was engaged for&nbsp;twenty-two years in the State surveys of Pennsylvania and&nbsp;New Jersey, his Reports on which were published during&nbsp;the years 1836-41. In 1842 he and his brother </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">William Barton&nbsp;Rogers</span><span class="font1"> (1805-1882), who had been similarly occupied in&nbsp;Virginia (his Reports w’ere published in 1838-41, and he&nbsp;wrote also on the connexion between thermal springs and&nbsp;anticlinal axes and faults), brought before the Association of&nbsp;American Geologists and Naturalists their conclusions on the&nbsp;physical structure of the Appalachian chain, and on the elevation of great mountain chains. The researches of H. D.&nbsp;Rogers were elaborated in his final </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Report on Pennsylvania&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1858), in which he included a general account of the geology&nbsp;of the United States and of the coal-fields of North America&nbsp;and Great Britain. In this important work he dealt aLo&nbsp;with the structure of the great coal-fields, the method of&nbsp;formation of the strata, and the changes in the character of&nbsp;the coal from the bituminous type to anthracite. In 1857&nbsp;he was appointed professor of natural history and geology&nbsp;at Glasgow. One of his later essays (1861) was on the parallel&nbsp;roads of Lochaber (Glen Roy), the origin of which he attributed&nbsp;to a vast inundation. He died at Glasgow on the 29th of&nbsp;May 1866.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROGERS, JAMES EDWIN THOROLD (1823-1890), English economist, was born at West Meon, Hampshire, in 1823. He&nbsp;was educated at King’s College, London, and Magdalen Hall,&nbsp;Oxford. After taking a first-class degree in 1846, he was&nbsp;ordained, and was for a few years a curate in Oxford. Subsequently, however, he resigned his orders. For some time the&nbsp;classics were tbe chief field of his activity. He devoted&nbsp;himself a good deal to classical and philosophical tuition in&nbsp;Oxford with success, and his publications included an edition&nbsp;of Aristotle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ethics</span><span class="font1"> (in 1865).
