<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(of great interest to the historian), the contents of which have been admirably reported upon by Sir Francis Palgrave,&nbsp;the enrolment of bails, proceedings in outlawry, the jail&nbsp;delivery rolls, and a mass of indictments, recognizances,&nbsp;and other similar documents. The prayer book known&nbsp;as the sealed copy of the “Book of Common Prayer”&nbsp;pursuant to statute 14 Charles II. is also among the records of the Court of Queen’s Bench.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Court of Common Pleas.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">—This court contains a far richer collection than the Court of Queen’s Bench, and from the&nbsp;nature of its jurisdiction the documents possess great&nbsp;interest for the genealogist and topographer. Foremost&nbsp;among them is the valuable collection of “feet of fines&nbsp;or final concords,” which date from Henry II. to the&nbsp;year 1834, when fines and recoveries were abolished and&nbsp;“ more simple modes of assurance substituted.” “ The&nbsp;utility of these records,” says the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Report</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the House of&nbsp;Commons’ committee on the state of the public records,&nbsp;“ to all persons desirous of tracing property and pedigree&nbsp;is unquestionable.” Fines contain the proceedings which&nbsp;have been adopted to convey estates and to free them from&nbsp;their entail to issue and from the dower of wives. Thus&nbsp;we are able to learn the name of the freeholder levying&nbsp;the fine, and if he was married the name of his wife and&nbsp;often of his children, the position and value of his estate,&nbsp;and not unfrequently something about his ancestors. Yet&nbsp;perhaps the chief value of this class of records is that they&nbsp;prove marriages and their issue at a time when parochial&nbsp;registers were not in existence. Few documents show so&nbsp;unbroken a succession from so early a date as these “ pedes&nbsp;finium.” The king’s Silver Office books are the chief indexes to the fines, but they suffered greatly from the fire&nbsp;at the king’s Silver Office in the Temple in March 1838.&nbsp;The recovery rolls (since 1834 continued under the name&nbsp;of “ disentailing assurances ” on the close rolls) also constitute another important supplement to the study of the&nbsp;pedes finium. Next to the collection of fines may be&nbsp;classed the judgment rolls of this court, or, as they are&nbsp;more commonly designated, the “ de banco ” rolls. They&nbsp;formerly consisted of two parts, the “ communia placita ”&nbsp;or personal plea rolls, and the “placita terras” or pleas of&nbsp;lands and deeds enrolled; but after the reign of Elizabeth&nbsp;the latter became distinct rolls, containing the king’s silver&nbsp;and fines, assizes, deeds enrolled, and all real actions. The&nbsp;judgment rolls pass through three stages—first, they are&nbsp;plea rolls; then, when the parties join issue, issue rolls;&nbsp;and lastly, when judgments are entered upon them, judgment rolls. The recording of the judgments has, however,&nbsp;been very much neglected, for many of the judgments,&nbsp;instead of being entered on the plea or issue rolls, have&nbsp;been entered on separate pieces of parchment, and thus&nbsp;have given rise to certain distinct bundles called “ riders,”&nbsp;in which such entries are contained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Court of Exchequer</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—This collection contains next to that of the Court of Chancery the most interesting and valuable series of documents among the English public records.&nbsp;The most important and most prominent series is that of&nbsp;the great rolls of the Exchequer, otherwise called the pipe&nbsp;rolls.@@<sup>1</sup> As with the close and patent rolls, so with the rolls&nbsp;of the pipe, it is difficult to state what is and what is not&nbsp;entered upon their membranes. Everything which in&nbsp;former times went to swell the revenues of the crown—&nbsp;rents of various kinds, fines, amercements, profits of lands&nbsp;and tenements, and the like—is to be found enrolled upon&nbsp;them. The accounts of the ancient revenue of the crown,&nbsp;digested under the heads of the several counties and&nbsp;annually written out in order to the charging and discharging of the sheriffs and other accountants, are also&nbsp;to be seen upon their membranes. If a great man was&nbsp;outlawed, his goods seized, his daughter married or made&nbsp;a ward, the account thereof can be read in the pipe rolls.&nbsp;To the pedigree-hunter these records are particularly useful, since they contain the names of most men of property;&nbsp;while to the county historian they are invaluable. Few of&nbsp;the English national archives boast a more uninterrupted&nbsp;suepession than the great rolls of the Exchequer. Beginning in the second year of Henry II., they continue to the&nbsp;present time with but two gaps—the rolls of the first&nbsp;year of Henry III. and of the seventh year of Henry IV.&nbsp;Of the latter of these missing rolls the antigraph or roll&nbsp;made by the chancellor’s scribe is still in existence and&nbsp;supplies the place of the lost roll. At the beginning of&nbsp;this series there is a roll which w׳as long looked upon as&nbsp;that of the first year of Henry II., or by some antiquaries&nbsp;as belonging to the fifth year of Stephen; but recent&nbsp;criticism seems to establish </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">thp</span><span class="font3"> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">fact that it is a roll of the&nbsp;31st year of Henry I.,—the earliest national document, save&nbsp;Domesday, of any extent that now exists. Another important class of documents belonging to the Court of Exchequer and stored with a variety of information upon&nbsp;secular and religious matters is the memoranda rolls,&nbsp;which extend from Henry III. to the middle of the present&nbsp;century. These rolls contain enrolments of all the ■weighty&nbsp;business done in the offices of the queen’s and lord treasurer’s remembrancer. Upon their membranes the inquirer will read how writs ran for the recovery of debts&nbsp;due to the crown, how commissions were appointed to&nbsp;seize estates attainted or forfeited to the crown, how goods&nbsp;were seized in the various ports of England for the nonpayment of customs, how the accounts of sheriffs and&nbsp;escheators were settled with the Exchequer, how cities&nbsp;and boroughs made claim to special privileges, and how&nbsp;the numerous proceedings in equity on English informations&nbsp;and bills were conducted. The “ brevia regia ” endorsed&nbsp;on the memoranda rolls are the most ancient writs of that&nbsp;description in the kingdom; in the earlier periods they&nbsp;assume the shape of letters and contain various wishes of&nbsp;the sovereigns. To the antiquary and historian the collection of archives called “originalia rolls,” which extend from&nbsp;Henry III. to William IV., is of great service. They&nbsp;not only throw considerable light upon the manners and&nbsp;customs in vogue in the 13th and 14tli centuries, but also&nbsp;record the descent of lands, questions relating to crown&nbsp;revenues and feudal tenures, the appointment of various&nbsp;commissions for different purposes of investigation, and&nbsp;other similar entries. The importance of the originalia&nbsp;rolls is also increased from the fact that they contain numerous extracts from early rolls now no longer in existence.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> la 1883 was founded the Pipe Roll Society, which has for its object the printing of the entire series of pipe rolls from the reign of&nbsp;Henry II.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Among the documents of the ancient Exchequer there is much to interest the purely ecclesiastical historian in&nbsp;the collection of ministers’ accounts of the issues and&nbsp;profits of monastic lands in the hands of the crowm; in&nbsp;the pensions granted to abbots and others upon the dissolution of the monasteries, now enrolled among the records&nbsp;of the Augmentation Office ; in the accounts of monasteries&nbsp;contained in the chartularies, the account books of first-fruits and tenths; in the taxation rolls which regulated&nbsp;the taxes as ■well to the kings as to the popes until the&nbsp;survey of Henry VIII.; in the Valor Ecclesiasticus of&nbsp;Henry VIII., which contains surveys of archbishoprics,&nbsp;bishoprics, abbeys, monasteries, and the like throughout&nbsp;the kingdom; in the visitations of religious houses; and&nbsp;in the Wolsey books. To the antiquary pure and simple&nbsp;the collection in the Exchequer which records the history&nbsp;of knights’ service is perhaps the most interesting. The&nbsp;number of knights’ fees throughout the kingdom was&nbsp;60,215, of which the clergy had 28,015 ; but, as in process</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
