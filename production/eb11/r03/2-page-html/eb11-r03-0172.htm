<p><span class="font1">ROE (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Row), </span><span class="font1">SIR THOMAS (c. 1581-1644), English diplomatist, son of Robert Rowe, and of Elinor, daughter of Robert Jermy of Worstead in Norfolk, was born at Low Leyton near&nbsp;Wanstead in Essex, and at the age of Uvclve (1593) matriculated&nbsp;at Magdalen College, Oxford. Shortly afterwards he joined&nbsp;one of the inns of court, and was made esquire of the body to&nbsp;Queen Elizabeth. He was knighted by James I. in 1605, and&nbsp;became intimate with Henry, prince of Wales, and also with&nbsp;bis sister Elizabeth, afterwards queen of Bohemia, with whom&nbsp;he maintained a correspondence and whose cause he championed. In 1610 he was sent by Prince Henry on a mission&nbsp;to the West Indies, during which he visited Guiana and the&nbsp;river Amazon, but failed then, and in two subsequent expeditions, to discover the gold which was the object of his travels.&nbsp;In 1614 he was elected M.P. for Tamworth, and in 1621 for&nbsp;Cirencester. His permanent reputation was mainly secured&nbsp;by the success which attended his embassy in 1615-18 to the&nbsp;court at Agra of the Great Mogul, Jahangir, the principal&nbsp;object of the mission being to obtain protection for an English&nbsp;factory at Surat. Appointed ambassador to the Porte in&nbsp;1621, which he even then describes as being “ irrevocably&nbsp;sick,” he distinguished himself by further successes. He&nbsp;obtained an extension of the privileges of the English merchants,&nbsp;concluded a treaty with Algiers in 1624, by which he secured&nbsp;the liberation of several hundred English captives, and .gained&nbsp;the support, by an English subsidy, of the Transylvanian&nbsp;Prince Bethlen Gabor for the European Protestant alliance&nbsp;and the cause of the Palatinate. Through his friendship with&nbsp;the patriarch of the Greek Church, Cyril Lucaris, the famous&nbsp;Codex Alexandrinus was presented to James I., and Roc himself&nbsp;collected several valuable MSS. which he subsequently presented to the Bodleian library. In 1629 he was again successful in another mission undertaken to arrange a peace between&nbsp;Sweden and Poland. Subsequently Roe negotiated trcaties&nbsp;with Danzig and Denmark, returning home in 1630, when a&nbsp;gold medal was struck in his honour. In January 1637 he&nbsp;was appointed chancellor of the Order of the Garter, with a&nbsp;pension of £1200 a year. Subsequently he took part in the&nbsp;peace conferences at Hamburg, Regensburg and Vienna, and&nbsp;used his influence to obtain the restoration of the Palatinate,&nbsp;the emperor declaring that he had “ scarce ever met with an&nbsp;ambassador till now.” In June 1640 he was made a privy&nbsp;councillor, and in October was returned to parliament as&nbsp;member for the university of Oxford, where his unrivalled&nbsp;knowledge of foreign affairs, commerce and finance, together&nbsp;with his learning and eloquence, gained for him in another&nbsp;sphere considerable reputation. He died on the 6th of November 1644. He had married Eleanor, daughter of Sir Thomas&nbsp;Carr of Stamford, Northamptonshire. Roe was a distinguished&nbsp;and most successful diplomatist, an accomplished scholar&nbsp;and a patron of learning, while his personal character was&nbsp;unblemished.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1">ROEBLING, JOHN AUGUSTUS (1806-1869), American civil engineer, was born at Mühlhausen, Prussia, on the 6th of June&nbsp;1806.· Soon after his graduation from the polytechnic school&nbsp;at Berlin he removed to the United States, and in 1831 entered&nbsp;on the practice of his profession in western Pennsylvania. He&nbsp;established at Pittsburg a manufactory of wire-rope, and in&nbsp;May 1845 completed his first important structure, a suspended&nbsp;aqueduct across the Allegheny river. This was followed by&nbsp;the Monongahela suspension bridge at Pittsburg and several&nbsp;suspended aqueducts on the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal.&nbsp;Removing his wire manufactory to Trenton, New Jersey, he&nbsp;began, in 1851, the erection at Niagara Falls of a long span&nbsp;wire suspension bridge with double roadway, for railway and&nbsp;carriage use (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bridge),</span><span class="font1"> which was completed in 1855. Ovdng&nbsp;to the novelty of its design, the most eminent engineers regarded&nbsp;this bridge as foredoomed to failure; but, with its complete&nbsp;success, demonstrated by long use, the number of suspension&nbsp;bridges rapidly multiplied, the use of wire-ropes instead of&nbsp;chain-cables becoming all but universal. The completion, in&nbsp;1867, of the still more remarkable suspension bridge over the&nbsp;Ohio river at Cincinnati, with a clear span of 1057 ft., added&nbsp;to Roebling’s reputation, and his design for the great bridge&nbsp;spanning the East river between New York and Brooklyn was&nbsp;accepted. While personally engaged in laying out the towers&nbsp;for the bridge, Roebling received an accidental injury, which&nbsp;resulted in his death, at Brooklyn, from tetanus, on the 22nd&nbsp;of July 1869. The bridge was completed under the direction&nbsp;of his son, Washington Augustus Roebling (b. 1837), who&nbsp;introduced several modifications in the original plans.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROEBUCK, JOHN (1718-1794), English inventor, was born in 1718 at Sheffield, where his father had a prosperous manufacturing business. After attending the grammar school at&nbsp;Sheffield and Dr Philip Doddridge’s academy at Northampton,&nbsp;he studied medicine at Edinburgh, where he was imbued with&nbsp;a taste for chemistry by the lectures of William Cullen and&nbsp;Joseph Black, and he finally graduated M.D. at Leiden in 1742.&nbsp;He started practice at Birmingham, but devoted much of Ids&nbsp;time to chemistry, especially in its practical applications.&nbsp;Among the most<sup>K</sup> important of his early achievements in this&nbsp;field was the introduction, in 1746, of leaden condensing&nbsp;chambers for use in the manufacture of sulphuric acid. Together with Samuel Garbett he erected a factory at Prestonpans,&nbsp;near Edinburgh, for the production of the acid in 1749, and for&nbsp;some years enjoyed a monopoly; but ultimately his methods&nbsp;became known, and, having omitted to take out patents for</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
