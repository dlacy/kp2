<p><span class="font2">appendages have acquired a new and quite special development. They are six in number, median, ventral and dorsal, and two unequal&nbsp;lateral pairs. The largest is placed ventrally at some distance&nbsp;distal to the mouth. Its free extremity is a plumose fan-like&nbsp;expansion (fig. 5, Aa and H). It is, ¡n common with others,&nbsp;a hollow process into which run two pairs of broad, coarsely&nbsp;transversely striated muscles. Each pair has a single insertion on&nbsp;the inner wall—the one pair near the free extremity of the limb, the&nbsp;other near its attachment; the bands run up, one of each pair on&nbsp;each side, and run right round the body forming an incomplete&nbsp;muscular girdle, the ends approximating in the median line. Above&nbsp;this point springs the large median dorsal limb, which terminates&nbsp;in groups of long setae. It presents a single pair of muscles attached&nbsp;along its inner wall which run up and form a muscular girdle round&nbsp;the body in its posterior third. On either side is attached a dorsolateral and ventro-lateral appendage, each with a fan-like plumose&nbsp;termination consisting of compound hairs or setae, found elsewhere&nbsp;only among arthropods </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.);</span><span class="font2"> each of these is moved*by muscles&nbsp;running upwards towards the neck and arising immediately under&nbsp;the trochal disk, the inferior ventro-lateral pair also presenting&nbsp;muscles which form a girdle in the hind region of the body. It bears&nbsp;a group of long setose hairs the bases of which are connected with&nbsp;the nerve fibre. There are also two pairs of distal antennae.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pedalion</span><span class="font2"> presents a pair of ciliated toes in the posterior region of&nbsp;the body (fig. 5, B, C, and D, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e),</span><span class="font2"> which it can apparently use as&nbsp;a means of attachment; Dr Hudson states that ne has seen it&nbsp;anchored by these and swimming round and round in a circle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reproduction Organs.—</span><span class="font2">Rotifera are unisexual, with the sexes dimorphic. The ovary is, as in many Platyhelminthes, duplex; one&nbsp;part, the germary,&nbsp;being an organ for the&nbsp;production by cell&nbsp;multiplication of the&nbsp;germ-cells or eggs&nbsp;proper, the other, the&nbsp;vitellarium, much more&nbsp;conspicuous and usually consisting of a definite number of large&nbsp;cells, producing yolk&nbsp;material for the growth&nbsp;of the egg. The whole&nbsp;ovary is unilateral&nbsp;and unpaired in most&nbsp;rotifers; symmetrical&nbsp;in Asplanchnaceae,&nbsp;Philodinaceae and&nbsp;Seisonaceae. In As-planchnaceae. the germary is median, continuous at the distal&nbsp;end with the middle&nbsp;of the transverse horse-shoe-shaped vitellary.&nbsp;In Bdelloidaceae and&nbsp;Seisonaceae the whole&nbsp;organ is paired, the&nbsp;germary proximal,&nbsp;the vitellary next the&nbsp;cloaca. As a rule,&nbsp;the wall of the ovary&nbsp;is continued into a&nbsp;uterine tube opening&nbsp;into the cloaca; but&nbsp;in Philodinaceae this is&nbsp;absent, and the young&nbsp;are free in the body&nbsp;cavity and escape by&nbsp;perforating the cloacal&nbsp;walls. The male organs are usually a testis, a targe seminal bladder and&nbsp;a protrusible penis. The males are unlike the females in most species;&nbsp;only in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eosphora digitata, Rhinops vitrea, Proales werneckii,</span><span class="font2"> and the&nbsp;Seisonaceae a complete digestive system is present. Frequently the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">foot is ciliated at the tip, as in the young of tubicolous forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The males of rotifers are of relatively rare occurrence, except in the genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Asplanchna,</span><span class="font2"> where they were first recognized as such by Bright-well in 1841; though those of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hydatina</span><span class="font2"> had*long since been seen&nbsp;and described as a distinct genus. Despite their rare occurrence,&nbsp;the males of over one hundred and twenty species have now been&nbsp;recognized, and we may well believe that all species will be found&nbsp;to present males. This statement may seem to need qualification;&nbsp;for the male of no Bdelloid has been seen, and there is but a doubtful&nbsp;record of <sup>41</sup> winter-eggs ” in this group. But possibly, as in Seisonaceae, the males resemble the females, and have escaped recognition.&nbsp;It may, however, well be that the capacity for wintering in the&nbsp;dry state has physiologically replaced the need for resistent fertilized&nbsp;eggs. . Insemination takes place either by the introduction of the&nbsp;penis into the cloaca of the female, or by the puncture of the body-wall of the female by the penis, and the injection of the sperm into&nbsp;the body cavity, whence the single spermatozoa must make their&nbsp;way to the eggs. The females habitually produce eggs without&nbsp;impregnation, which again habitually develop into females, more&nbsp;rarely into males. These unfertilized eggs develop directly, often&nbsp;in the uterus. In other cases the eggs are liberated earlier and&nbsp;adhere to the foot, or are hatched within the tube (fig. 3, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b, c).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The impregnated eggs undergo a very partial development in the&nbsp;mother, and these pass into a state of rest, for which they are&nbsp;furnished with a dense shell. They always give rise to partheno-genetic females (see Reproduction). The thin-walled eggs are&nbsp;often termed <sup>44</sup> summer-eggs,” the fertilized ones <sup>44</sup> winter ” or&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> ephippial ” eggs (by parity with the phyllopod Entomostraca, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.}.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">But the appearance of males seems to be as much associated with&nbsp;those of summer drought as of winter cold. No adequate knowledge&nbsp;of the conditions under which males arise has been established. The&nbsp;phenomenon of seasonal dimorphism is of especial moment for the&nbsp;plankton dwellers. Not only is the appearance of males regular, but&nbsp;the forms of the females at different times of the year may be so&nbsp;distinct as to have led them to be classed as distinct species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Development.</span><span class="font2">—The egg is holoblastic, but the segmentation is very unequal, recalling that </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">marine annelids and of molluscs. Gastru-lation takes place by epiboly, and the stomodaeum (oral invagination&nbsp;—mastax pharynx) takes place in two stages of the region of the&nbsp;closed blastopore. Un</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">like the molluscs and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">annelids, however, the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">cloacal invagination lies</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">outside this region, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the foot is formed by an</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">elongation of the end of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the body between the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">two apertures. The nerve</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ganglion is formed by</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">an ingrowth of epiblast,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and so are the pedal</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">glands. The body</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">cavity is the primitive</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">blastocoele.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Relationships and Morphology.—</span><span class="font2">Passing over the earlier authors who&nbsp;regarded this group as&nbsp;allied to Infusoria, a view&nbsp;first contested by Dujardin, T. H. Huxley viewed&nbsp;them as equivalent to&nbsp;and on a level with the&nbsp;larvae of Echinoderms,&nbsp;and of such other trocho-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">g</span><span class="font2">hore larvae as resem-led these, a view generally adopted. But it became more and more&nbsp;apparent that the larvae&nbsp;of this category developed mouth, gut and&nbsp;anus by the closure in&nbsp;the middle of such a slitlike blastopore opening&nbsp;into a sack-like stomach&nbsp;as is seen in the larvae&nbsp;of Turbellaria and Ne-mertina. The extra-blastoporic opening of&nbsp;the cloaca leads us to a&nbsp;very different view, which&nbsp;finds negative support&nbsp;in the failure of previous&nbsp;morphologists to adapt&nbsp;the details of development and of the structure of the disk to their identification of <sup>44</sup> trochus ” and&nbsp;<sup>44</sup> cingulum ” with the preoral and postoral wreaths of the&nbsp;trochophore larva. We homologize the rotifer with the Tur-bellarian larva (fig. 8, A), and with the preoral or upper part&nbsp;of the trochopore (fig. 8, E, F). Its adhesive foot is paralleled by a&nbsp;cup-shaped ciliated depression, possibly nervous, found in all the&nbsp;larvae cited, except some Echinoderms, and which in Asterids&nbsp;and.Crinoids actually serves as an organ of attachment. This view&nbsp;obviates the deed for assuming the complicated flexures of the&nbsp;wreath which has to be done on other assumptions (see Rotifera,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Encycl. Brit.</span><span class="font2"> ed. 9). Thus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Trochosphaera</span><span class="font2"> (fig. 8, D) (which has a&nbsp;male of the. same type as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Melicerta,</span><span class="font2"> &amp;c.) is an extremely modified&nbsp;type, and its resemblance to the trochophore larva of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lepado-rhynchus</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Polygordius</span><span class="font2"> is only superficial. We may note that it&nbsp;was long since shown that the apical organ (at first assumed to.be&nbsp;the brain) of these larvae was innervated from an anterior thickening&nbsp;of the circular nerve ring, corresponding with the brain of Rotifers;&nbsp;the nerve cells immediately below the pit are the ordinary bipolar</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
