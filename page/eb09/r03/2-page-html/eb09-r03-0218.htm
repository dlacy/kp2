<p><span class="font3">make sketches before he learned to write,” and that he covered his lesson-books with caricatures of his masters&nbsp;and fellow-pupils. On leaving school he became a student&nbsp;in the Royal Academy. At the age of sixteen he resided&nbsp;and studied for a time in Paris, and he afterwards made&nbsp;frequent tours on the Continent, enriching his portfolios&nbsp;with numerous jottings of life and character. In 1775&nbsp;he exhibited at the Royal Academy a drawing of Delilah&nbsp;visiting Samson in Prison, and in the following years&nbsp;he was represented by various portraits and landscapes.&nbsp;Possessed of much facility of execution and a ready command of the figure, he was spoken of as a promising&nbsp;student ; and had he continued his early application he&nbsp;would have made his mark as a painter. But he was the&nbsp;victim of a disastrous piece of good fortune. By the death&nbsp;of his aunt, a French lady, he fell heir to a sum of&nbsp;■£7000, and presently he plunged into the dissipations of&nbsp;the town. Gambling became a passion with him, and&nbsp;he has been known to sit at the gaming-table for thirty-six hours at a stretch. In time poverty overtook him ;&nbsp;and the friendship and example of Gillray and Bunbury&nbsp;seem to have suggested that his early aptitude for caricature might furnish a ready means of filling an empty purse.&nbsp;His drawing of Vauxhall, shown in the Royal Academy&nbsp;exhibition of 178-4, had been engraved by Pollard, and the&nbsp;print was a success. Rowlandson was largely employed&nbsp;by Rudolph Ackermann, the art publisher, who in 1809-1811 issued in his </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Poetical Magazine</span><span class="font3"> “The Schoolmaster’s&nbsp;Tour”—a series of plates with illustrative verses by Dr&nbsp;William Coombe. They were the most popular of the&nbsp;artist’s works. Again engraved by Rowlandson himself in&nbsp;1812, and issued under the title of the Tour of Dr Syntax&nbsp;in Search of the Picturesque, they had attained a fifth&nbsp;edition by 1813, and were followed in 1820 by Dr Syntax&nbsp;in SearchofConsolation, andin 1821 by the Third Tourof&nbsp;Dr Syntax, in Search of a Wife. The same collaboration&nbsp;of designer, author, and publisher appeared in the English&nbsp;Dance of Death, issued in 1814-16, one of the most&nbsp;admirable of Rowlandson’s series, and in the Dance of Life,&nbsp;1822. Rowlandson also illustrated Smollett, Goldsmith,&nbsp;and Sterne, and his designs will be found in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Spirit&nbsp;of the Public Journals</span><span class="font3"> (1825), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The English Spy</span><span class="font3"> (1825), and&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Humourist</span><span class="font3"> (1831). He died in London, after a prolonged illness, on the 22d April 1827.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rowlandson’s designs were usually executed in outline with the reed-pen, and delicately washed with colour. They were then&nbsp;etched by the artist on the copper, and afterwards aqua-tinted—&nbsp;usually by a professional engraver, the impressions being finally&nbsp;coloured by hand. As a designer he was characterized by the&nbsp;utmost facility and ease of draughtsmanship. He poured forth his&nbsp;designs in ill-considered profusion, and the quality of his art&nbsp;suffered from this haste and over-production. He was a true if&nbsp;not a very refined humorist, dealing less frequently than his fierce&nbsp;contemporary Gillray with politics, but commonly touching, in a&nbsp;rather gentle spirit, the various aspects and incidents of social life.&nbsp;His most artistic work is to be found among the more careful&nbsp;drawings of his earlier period ; but even among the gross forms and&nbsp;exaggerated caricature of bis later time we find, here and there, in&nbsp;the graceful lines of a figure or the sweet features of some maiden’s&nbsp;face, sufficient hints that this master of the humorous might have&nbsp;attained to the beautiful had he so willed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">ROWLEY, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">William,</span><span class="font3"> actor and dramatist, collaborated with several of the celebrated dramatists of the Elizabethan&nbsp;period—Dekker, Middleton, Heywood, Fletcher, Webster,&nbsp;Massinger, and Ford. Nothing is known of his life&nbsp;except that he was an actor in various companies, and&nbsp;married in 1637. There was another Rowley, an actor and&nbsp;playright in the same generation, Samuel, and probably a&nbsp;third, Ralph. Four plays by W. Rowley are extant,—</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;Woman never Vext</span><span class="font3"> (printed 1632), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A Match at MidnigJct&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">(1633), </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">All <sup>,</sup>s Lost by Lust</span><span class="font3"> (1633), and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">A SJioemaker a</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gentleman</span><span class="font3"> (1638). From these an opinion may be formed of his individual style. Effectiveness of situation and ingenuity of plot are more marked in them than any special&nbsp;literary faculty, from which we may conjecture why he was&nbsp;in such request as an associate in play-making. There are&nbsp;significant quotations from two of his plays in Lamb’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Specimens.</span><span class="font3"> It is recorded by Langbaine that he “ was&nbsp;beloved of those great men Shakespeare, Fletcher, and&nbsp;Jonson ”; and the tradition of his personal amiability is&nbsp;supported by the fact of his partnerships with so many&nbsp;different writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ROWLEY REGIS, an urban sanitary district of Staffordshire, is situated on the Birmingham Canal, and on the Stourbridge branch of the Great Western Railway, 6 miles&nbsp;west of Birmingham. The original village surrounds the&nbsp;parish church, dating from the 13th century, but rebuilt in&nbsp;1840 with the exception of the tower, which was also rebuilt&nbsp;in 1858. The village is situated in a rich coal and ironstone district, and round it numerous hamlets have grown&nbsp;up within recent years. Lately the parish has been erected&nbsp;into an urban sanitary district, governed by a local board&nbsp;of fifteen members. Besides collieries, iron works, and extensive quarries for “ Rowley rag ” (a basaltic intrusion),&nbsp;there are potteries, rivet, chain, and anchor works, breweries,&nbsp;and agricultural implement works, the district being one of&nbsp;the most important manufacturing centres of Staffordshire.&nbsp;The population of the urban sanitary district (area 3670&nbsp;acres) in 1871 was 23,534 and in 1881 it was 27,385.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">ROXBURGH, a border county of Scotland, occupying the greater part of the border line with England, is bounded&nbsp;E. and S.E. by Northumberland, S.E. by Cumberland,&nbsp;S.W. by Dumfriesshire, W. by Selkirkshire, N.W. by&nbsp;Midlothian, and N.E. by Berwickshire. It lies between&nbsp;55° 6' 30&quot; and 55° 42' 30&quot; N. lat., and between 2° 10' and&nbsp;3° 7' W. long. Its greatest length from north to south is&nbsp;43 miles, and its greatest breadth about 30 miles. The&nbsp;area is 428,464 acres, or about 670 square miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Surface and Geology.—</span><span class="font3">The greater part of Roxburgh is included in Teviotdale. The whole course of the Teviot,&nbsp;40 miles in length, is included within the county. It rises&nbsp;in the ranges of greywacke hills which separate the county&nbsp;from Dumfriesshire and Selkirk, and runs north-eastwards,&nbsp;following the deposition of the greywacke rocks to the&nbsp;Tweed at Kelso, and dividing the county into two unequal&nbsp;parts. On the north a high range of land runs parallel&nbsp;with its banks and slopes to its margin. South-west between Dumfries and Cumberland the greywacke formation&nbsp;constitutes an almost continuous succession of eminences,&nbsp;through which the Liddel finds its way southwards. The&nbsp;highest summits of the greywacke ranges exceed 1800 feet.&nbsp;Although occasionally rocky and rugged, the hills are for&nbsp;the most part rounded in outline and clothed with grass to&nbsp;their summits. This Silurian formation occupies nearly&nbsp;the whole of the western half of the county, but along with&nbsp;the greywacke rocks is associated clay slate of a bluish&nbsp;colour, glimmering with minute scales of mica and frequently traversed by veins of calcareous spar. The formation is succeeded to the eastward by an extensive deposit&nbsp;of Old Red Sandstone, forming an irregular quadrangular&nbsp;area towards the centre of the county, emitting two irregular projections from its southern extremity, and interrupted&nbsp;towards the north by an intrusion of trap rocks. Owing&nbsp;to the sandstone formation the transverse valleys formed&nbsp;by various affluents of the Teviot present features of great&nbsp;interest. The action of the water has scooped deep&nbsp;channels in the rock, and thus formed picturesque narrow&nbsp;defiles, of which the high sandstone scaurs are a pro-</span></p>
