the condition of a servant, or rather ſlave.</p><p>Under the declenſion of the Roman empire, a new kind of ſervitude was introduced, different from that of the ancient Romans : it conſiſted in leaving the lands of ſubjugated nations to the firſt owners, upon condition of certain rents, and ſervile offices, to be paid in acknowledgment. Hence the names of <hi rend="italic">ſervi censiti, ascriptitii,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">addicti gleba ;</hi> ſome whereof were taxable at the reaſonable diſcretion of the lord ; others at a certain rate agreed on ; and others were mainmortable, who, having no legitimate children, could not make a will to above the value of five pence, the lord being heir of all the rest ; and others were prohibited marrying, or going to live out of the lordſhip. Moſt of theſe ſervices exiſted lately in France ; but they were long ago aboliſhed in England. Such, however, was the original oſ our tenures, &amp; c.
