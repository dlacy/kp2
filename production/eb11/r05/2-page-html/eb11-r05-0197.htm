<p><span class="font1">and Wrangdike hundred are mentioned in the middle of the 12th century, the latter formerly including the additional&nbsp;hundred of Little Casterton. The shire-court for Rutland was&nbsp;held at Oakham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rutland was originally included in the diocese of Lincoln, and in 1291 formed a rural deanery within the archdeaconry&nbsp;of Northampton; but on the erection of Peterborough to an&nbsp;episcopal see by Henry VIII. in 1541, the archdeaconry' of&nbsp;Northampton, with the deanery of Rutland, was transferred to&nbsp;that diocese. In 1879 the deanery of Rutland was subdivided&nbsp;into three portions, and in 1876 it was placed within the newly-founded archdeaconry of Oakham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the most conspicuous of the Norman lords connected with this county was Walkelin de Ferrers, who founded Oakham&nbsp;Castle in the 12th century. The castle was subsequently bestowed by Richard II., together with the earldom of Rutland&nbsp;(see above), on Edward, son of Edmund, duke of York.&nbsp;Essendine (Essenden or Essingdon) was purchased in 1545 by&nbsp;Richard Cecil of Burleigh, and the title of baron of Essenden&nbsp;bestowed on his grandson is retained by the carls of Salisbury.&nbsp;Sir Everard Digby, one of the conspirators in the Gunpowder&nbsp;plot, belonged to the family of Digby, of Stoke Dry. Burley-on-the-hill was held by Henry Despenser, the warlike bishop&nbsp;of Norwich, in the reign of Richard II., and was purchased by&nbsp;George Villiers, duke of Buckingham, who entertained James I.&nbsp;there with Ben Jonson’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mask of the Gypsies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The battle of Stamford was fought at Horn, near Exton, in March 1470 between Edward IV. and the Lancastrians, when&nbsp;from the precipitate flight of the latter the engagement became&nbsp;known as Losecoat Field. On the outbreak of the Civil War&nbsp;Rutland displayed a strong puritanical and anti-royalist sentiment, and in 1642 the sheriff and a large number of the gentry&nbsp;and nobility of the county forwarded a petition to the House&nbsp;of Lords begging that the county might be placed in a state&nbsp;of defence, and that the votes of papists and prelates might be&nbsp;disallowed; and again, in 1648, a memorial addressed to Lord&nbsp;Fairfax protested against the design of the parliament to treat&nbsp;with Charles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">' Rutland has always been mainly an agricultural county. The Domesday Survey mentions numerous mills in Rutland,&nbsp;and a fishery at Ayston rendered 325 eels. In the 14th century&nbsp;the county exported wool. Stilton cheese has long been made&nbsp;in Leyfield Forest and the vale of Catmose, and limestone is dug&nbsp;in many parts of the county. The development of the economic&nbsp;resources of Rutland was helped in 1793 by the extension of the&nbsp;Melton Mowbray canal to Oakham.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two members were returned to parliament for the county of Rutland from 1295 until under the Redistribution of Seats Act&nbsp;of 1885 the representation was reduced to one member.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The only old castle of which there are important remains is Oakham, dating from the time of Henry II. and remarkable for&nbsp;its Norman hall. Of Essendine Castle only the moat remains.&nbsp;The Bede-house at Liddington dates from the end of the 14th&nbsp;century. Hambleton Hall, now a farm-house, is a good specimen&nbsp;of Jacobean architecture. Many old houses of the 17th and 18th&nbsp;centuries are to be met with in the villages. An interesting feature&nbsp;of the ecclesiastical architecture of the county is the frequent continuation of the round-headed arch after the Early English style&nbsp;had become fully developed; as, for instance, in the Early English&nbsp;churches at Great Casterton, Stretton, Empingham, Clipsnam&nbsp;(Early English and Decorated), and St Peter’s, Preston, where the&nbsp;nave arcade is Norman on one side and Early English on the other,&nbsp;but yet retains round-headed arches on both sides. Tickencote&nbsp;church is a remarkable specimen of. late Norman work, with one </span><span class="font0">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the finest chancel-arches extant in this style. Ketton church&nbsp;is transitional Norman, Early English, and early Decorated, the&nbsp;broach spire being of later date. St Mary’s., Greet ham, is a good&nbsp;example of Decorated, with fine tower and spire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUTLAND, a city and the county seat of Rutland county, Vermont, U.S.A., on Otter creek, about 67 m. S. by E. of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Burlington. Pop. (1900) 11,499, of whom 1533 were foreign-bom; (1910 census) 13,546. Area, SJ sq. m. It is served by the Delaware &amp; Hudson (being a terminus of one of its&nbsp;branches) and the Rutland (New York Central system) railways.&nbsp;It is pleasantly situated within sight of the Green Mountains.&nbsp;Among its public buildings and institutions are the United&nbsp;States Government Building, the State House of Correction,&nbsp;the Rutland Free Library (1886, with 17,500 volumes in 1908),&nbsp;the H. H. Baxter Memorial Library, a Memorial Hall, the County&nbsp;Court House, the City Hall, and the City Hospital. The famous&nbsp;Rutland marble is quarried in W. Rutland (pop. in 1910, 3427&nbsp;and Proctor (pop. in 1910, 2871), which were parts of the township of Rutland until 1886. In 1905 the value of the city’s&nbsp;factory products was $2,522,856 (28-8% more than in 1900).&nbsp;The township of Rutland was granted by New Hampshire in&nbsp;1761 to John Murray of Rutland, Massachusetts, and about the&nbsp;same time it was granted (as Fairfield) by New York. No&nbsp;settlement was made until 1770, and in 1772 the place was again&nbsp;granted by New York under the name of Socialborough. From&nbsp;1784 to 1804 Rutland was one of the capitals of Vermont, and&nbsp;the Capitol, built in 1784, is the second oldest building in the&nbsp;state. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rutland Herald,</span><span class="font1"> one of the oldest newspapers in&nbsp;Vermont still published, was established as a Federalist weekly&nbsp;in 1794*—a daily edition first appeared in 1861, and is now&nbsp;Republican. In 1847 the village of Rutland was incorporated,&nbsp;and in 1892 a portion of the township including the village was&nbsp;chartered as a city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUTLEDGE, JOHN (1739-1800), American jurist and politician, was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1739. • He studied law&nbsp;in London and began to practise in Charleston in 1761. He&nbsp;was a delegate to the Stamp Act Congress in 1765, and to the&nbsp;Continental Congress in 1774-77 and 1782-83; he was chairman of the committee which framed the state constitution of&nbsp;1776, and the first “ president ” (governor) of South Carolina in&nbsp;1776-78. Disapproving of certain changes in the constitution,&nbsp;he resigned in 1778, but was elected governor in the following&nbsp;year, and served until 1782. From 1784 to 1789 he was a&nbsp;member of the state court of chancery. In the Constitutional&nbsp;Convention of 1787 he urged that the president and the Federal&nbsp;judges should be chosen by the national legislature, and preferably by the Senate alone, and that the president should be&nbsp;chosen for a term of seven years, and should be ineligible to&nbsp;succeed himself. Rutledge championed the Constitution in&nbsp;the South Carolina convention by which that instrument was&nbsp;adopted on behalf of the state. He was associate justice of the&nbsp;United States Supreme Court in 1789-91, and chief justice&nbsp;of the supreme court of South Carolina in 1791-95. Nominated&nbsp;chief justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in 1795,&nbsp;he presided during the August term, but the Senate refused to&nbsp;confirm the nomination, apparently because of his opposition&nbsp;to the Jay Treaty. His mind failed late in 1795, and he died&nbsp;in Charleston on the 23rd of July 1800.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His brother, Edward Rutledge (1749-1800), a signer of the Declaration of Independence, was born in Charleston on the 23rd&nbsp;of November 1749. He studied law in his brother’s office, and in&nbsp;London in 1769-73, and began to practise in Charleston in 1773.&nbsp;He served in the Continental Congress in 1774-77, and was sent&nbsp;with John Adams and Benjamin Franklin to confer on terms&nbsp;of peace with Lord Howe on Staten Island in September 1776.&nbsp;As captain of artillery and later as lieutenant-colonel he served&nbsp;against the British in South Carolina in 1779-80, but he was&nbsp;captured near Charleston in 1780, and was imprisoned at&nbsp;St Augustine, Florida, for a year. He was a member of the&nbsp;state legislature from 1782 to 1798, and in 1791 drafted the&nbsp;act which abolished primogeniture in South Carolina. From&nbsp;1798 until his death in Charleston, on the 23rd of January 1800,&nbsp;he was governor of South Carolina.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUTLEY, FRANK (1842-1904), English geologist and petrog-rapher, was born at Dover on the 14th of May 1842. He was educated partly at Bonn, but his interest in geology was kindled&nbsp;at the Royal School of Mines, where he studied from 1862-64;&nbsp;he then joined the army, and served as lieutenant until 1867,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
