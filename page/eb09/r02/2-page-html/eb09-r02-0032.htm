<p><span class="font0">region, and represented by five genera, which, if not peculiar to Tropical America, are at least confined to the New World, like&nbsp;Cenchris and Crotakus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Reptilian fauna of tropical America thus shows relations to the other equatorial regions in three of its&nbsp;constituent parts only, viz., in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelydidæ, Amphis-bænidæ,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crotalidæ.</span><span class="font1"> It has the former type in&nbsp;common with Africa and Australia ; but, whilst the&nbsp;presence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx</span><span class="font1"> on the African continent forms an&nbsp;important distinctive feature, the resemblance of South&nbsp;America to Madagascar is as great as, or even greater&nbsp;than, that to Australia, which lacks </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the other hand the Lacertilian fauna is essentially distinct from that of the Old World, with the exception&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbænidæ</span><span class="font1"> (and of species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eublepharidæ),</span><span class="font1"> whose&nbsp;presence in South America and Africa is a most remarkable fact, and very strong evidence of the former existence&nbsp;of intervening land. The Skinks and Geckos, which are&nbsp;generally distributed over the warmer parts of the globe,&nbsp;cannot come into consideration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Snakes of Tropical America differ also much more from those of the Old-World regions than certain other&nbsp;portions of its fauna, as, for instance, its Batrachians and&nbsp;Freshwater Fishes. A distinct affinity with India is&nbsp;expressed only by the development of the family of Pit&nbsp;Vipers,—the presence in both regions of numerous Tree&nbsp;Snakes, of species of the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geophis,</span><span class="font1"> of the family&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tortricidæ,</span><span class="font1"> Ac., being less significant points of resemblance.&nbsp;But these resemblances are more than counterbalanced by&nbsp;the absence in South America of Lycodonts, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tropidoηoti,&nbsp;Pythonidæ, Erycidæ.</span><span class="font1"> The African Ophidian fauna</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> is&nbsp;still further removed by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crotalidæ</span><span class="font1"> being entirely wanting&nbsp;and replaced by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Viperidæ</span><span class="font1"> ; only a few genera, like </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Steηo-stoma, Coronxlla, Leptodira, Dipsas, Ahætulla,</span><span class="font1"> are examples&nbsp;in which species are found in both regions. In both&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tropidonotus</span><span class="font1"> is almost absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As all the innocuous Colubrine Snakes of Australia are derived from the Indian region, they form no part in a&nbsp;comparison between the Australian and South-American&nbsp;faunæ. Of the other Ophidian types these regions have&nbsp;not a single genus in common, nor a family which would&nbsp;not be represented also either in Africa or India or both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">5. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The North-American Region.—</span><span class="font1">While the Chelonians of the North-American or Nearctic region (in which, so far&nbsp;as this Reptilian order is concerned, Central America and&nbsp;the West Indies have to be included) are essentially&nbsp;different from those of South America, the Lizards and&nbsp;Snakes of both belong to the same family types, and pass&nbsp;in an unbroken series from the northern to the southern&nbsp;parts of the New World.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this region the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emydidæ</span><span class="font1"> have attained to as great a development as in the Indian, and are associated with a&nbsp;few representatives of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx.</span><span class="font1"> The species,&nbsp;which are altogether about fifty in number, and of which&nbsp;a few are common to the Central-American and North-American sections, are distributed as follows :—</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font0">It may be seen from this list that no Chelydoid passes northward beyond the Isthmus of Panama ; the Chelonians of Central America&nbsp;belong exclusively to the Emydidæ, which are represented by some&nbsp;thirty species ; the majority do not extend either into South or&nbsp;North America ; two of the genera, Dermatemys and Staurotypus&nbsp;are peculiar to it, and Cinosternurn has its headquarters in this&nbsp;section. Neither Trionyx nor Testudo occurs. Proceeding beyond&nbsp;the Mexican boundary, we find still the Emydidæ predominating,&nbsp;a few of the species of Central America ranging northwards into the&nbsp;United States ; distinct species of Clemmys,@@<sup>3</sup> Cinosternurn, Chelydra,&nbsp;he., appear, with the wonderful genus Maeroclemrnys. An instance&nbsp;of the isolated occurrence of a Testudο ( T. polyphemus) is met with&nbsp;here ; and from the lower part of the Mississippi northward one of&nbsp;the most characteristic features of the North-American fauna makes&nbsp;.its appearance, viz., two species of Trionyx, of which one at least&nbsp;follows the ramifications of that river northward and has found its&nbsp;way into Lake Winnipeg (51° N. lat. ). West of the Rocky Mountains&nbsp;Tortoises are scarce and of distinct species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the West Indies the following species have been found :— 1, Testudo tabulata; 2, Podocnemis dumeriliana ; 3, Emys continua ;&nbsp;4, E. decussata ; 5, E. rugosa. Of these the first two are identical&nbsp;with South-American, and the third with a North-American species,&nbsp;and, therefore, may be regarded as strangers which in comparatively recent times have been introduced into the West Indies. On&nbsp;the other hand the last two are species peculiar to the islands, and,&nbsp;as they belong to a North-American generic type, clearly prove the&nbsp;pertinence of this island district to the northern continent, so far&nbsp;as Tortoises are concerned.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The south-eastern parts of North America are inhabited by an Alligator which is specifically distinct and locally&nbsp;separated from the southern species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tropical Lacertilian and Ophidian faunæ gradually merge into that of the temperate north, and any boundary&nbsp;line drawn between the north and south is more or less&nbsp;arbitrary. As a matter of fact so many truly tropical&nbsp;forms advance north of the tropic of Cancer (which by&nbsp;many authors is taken as the boundary line) that we are&nbsp;inclined to restrict the limits of this region to the district&nbsp;about the Rio Grande, whilst, on the other hand, the&nbsp;northern fauna extends to a lower latitude on the plateau&nbsp;of Mexico. Thus restricted, the North-American fauna&nbsp;includes about fifty species of Lizards, belonging to genera&nbsp;which with very few exceptions are already represented in&nbsp;Central America, or even farther southwards. By far the&nbsp;greatest number are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iguanidæ ; </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scincwlæ, Anguidæ,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tejidæ</span><span class="font1"> are represented by several, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geckonidæ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">by fewer species, whilst single species occur of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbænidæ, Aniellidæ, Lepidophymidæ,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Helοder-matidæ,—</span><span class="font1">all Central-American types. In fact, North&nbsp;America does not possess one family of Lizards peculiar&nbsp;to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">11 is worthy of notice that Lizards do not extend so far northwards in the western as in the eastern hemisphere ; one species (Gerrhonotus cœruleus) ranges into British Columbia, another into&nbsp;Minnesota CEumeces septeηtrioηalis), and a third into Massachusetts&nbsp;CFumeces fasciatτιs).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Snakes about one hundred@@<sup>4</sup> species could be enumerated, with a proportion of 1 :14 of poisonous to innocuous Snakes. All the&nbsp;families represented in this fauna occur also in tropical America,&nbsp;and there is a great agreement of the genera with those of the Central-American district, so that less than one-half can be considered&nbsp;as peculiar to this region, viz., Cοnocephalus, Carρlιophis, Contia,&nbsp;Cemophora, Hypsiglena, Chersodramus, Rhiηxchilus, Pituοphis,&nbsp;Ischnognathus, Clιαriηa, Wenona, Lichanura. Calamariidæ and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a Check-list published by the U.S. National Museum in 1883</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">a much larger number of “ North-American” terrestrial Chelonians is given, viz., forty-three. This is partly due to the southern boundary&nbsp;of “ North America” being extended to the tropic of Cancer, partly to&nbsp;the fact that species are admitted in a different sense from those of the&nbsp;herpetologists of the Old World. By adopting these species a very&nbsp;erroneous impression would be created as regards the comparative&nbsp;numbers of the groups in the several regions. That check-list&nbsp;includes three species of Testudο, three of Cistudo, twenty-one of&nbsp;Emys and its subgenera, five of Cinosternurn, two of Αronιοchelys, one&nbsp;each of Mαcroclemrnys and Chelydra, and six of Trionyx.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emys blandingii may be erased from the list of species ; we have&nbsp;recently examined a specimen ; it is identical with Emys lutaria, and&nbsp;has evidently been introduced from Europe.</span></p>
