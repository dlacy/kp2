            <p>so much on account of any apprehended injury to his literary 'reputation from the
                publication of such unfinished works, as from an anxiety lest the progress of truth
                should be retarrded by the statement of doctrines of which the principles were not
                fully developed.</p>
            <p>The following observations on the private character and habits of Dr. Smith proceed
                from the pen of Mr. Stewart, who knew him well, and who was the last survivor of
                that galaxy of illustrious men who shed, during the last century, so imperishable a
                glory over the literature of Scotland. “ The more delicate and characteristical
                features of his mind,” Mr. Stewart observes, “ it is perhaps impossible to trace.
                That there were many peculiarities, both in his manners and in his intellectual
                habits, was manifest to the most superficial observer ; but although, to those who
                knew him, these peculiarities detracted nothing from the respect which his abilities
                commanded ; and although, to his intimate friends, they added an inexpressible charm
                to his con- versation, while they displayed, in the most interesting light, the
                artless simplicity of his heart; yet it would require a very skilful pencil to
                present them to the public eye. He was certainly not fitted for the general commerce
                of the world, or for the business of active life. The comprehensive speculations
                with which he had been occupied from his youth, and the variety of materials which
                his own invention continually supplied to his thoughts, rendered him habitually
                inattentive to familiar objects, and to common occurrences ; and he frequently
                exhibited instances of absence, which had scarcely been surpassed by the fancy of La
                Bruyere. Even in company he was apt to he engrossed with his studies ; and appeared
                at times, by the motion of his lips, as well as by his looks and gestures, to be in
                the fervour of composition. I have often, however, been struck, at the distance of
                years, with his accurate memory of the most trifling particulars ; and am inclined
                to believe, from this and some other circumstances, that he possessed a power, not
                perhaps uncommon among absent men, of re- collecting, in consequence of subsequent
                efforts of reflection, many occurrences which, at the time when they happened, did
                not seem to have sensibly attracted his notice.</p>
            <p>“ To the defect now mentioned, it was probably owing, in part, that he did not fall
                in easily with the common dialogue of conversation, and that he was somewhat apt to
                convey his own ideas in the form of a lecture. When he did so, however, it never
                proceeded from a wish to engross the discourse, or to gratify his vanity. His own
                inclination disposed him so strongly to enjoy in silence the gaiety of those around
                him, that his friends were often led to concert little schemes, in order to engage
                him in the discussions most likely to interest him. Nor do I think I shall be
                accused of going too far when I say, that he was scarcely ever known to start a new
                topic himself, or to appear un- prepared upon those topics that were introduced by
                others. Indeed, his conversation was never more amusing than when he gave a loose to
                his genius upon the very few branches of knowledge of which he only possessed the
                outlines.</p>
            <p>“ The opinions he formed of men, upon a slight acquaintance, were frequently
                erroneous ; but the tendency of his nature inclined him much more to blind
                partiality than to ill-founded prejudice. The enlarged views of human affairs, on
                which his mind habitually dwelt, left him neither time nor inclination to study, in
                detail, the uninteresting peculiarities of ordinary characters ; and accordingly,
                though intimately acquainted with the capacities of the intellect, and the workings
                of the heart, and accustomed, in his theories, to mark, with the most delicate hand,
                the nicest shades, both of genius and of the passions ; yet, in judging of indi-
                viduals, it sometimes happened that his estimates were, in a surprising degree, wide
                of the truth.</p>
            <p>“ In his external form and appearance there was nothing uncommon. When perfectly at
                ease, and when warmed</p>
            <p>with conversation, his gestures were animated, and not un- graceful ; and, in the
                society of those he loved, his features were often brightened with a smile of
                inexpressible benig- nity. In the company of strangers, his tendency to absence, and
                perhaps still more his consciousness of this tendency, rendered his manner somewhat
                embarrassed ;—an effect which was probably not a little heightened by those
                speculative ideas of propriety, which his recluse habits tended at once to perfect
                in his conception, and to diminish his power of realizing.”</p>
            <p>The following is a list of the published works of Dr. Smith.</p>
            <list type="ordered">
                <item>Two articles in the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi> for 1755, being,
                    (1) a Review of Johnson’s <hi rend="italic">English Dictionary,</hi> and (2) <hi
                        rend="italic">A Letter to the Editors.</hi></item>
                <item><hi rend="italic">The Theory Of Moral Sentiments.</hi> The first edition of
                    this work was published in 8vo, early in 1759. The sixth edition was published a
                    short time before the author’s death. It contains several additions, most of
                    which were executed during his last illness.</item>
                <item><hi rend="italic">Considerations concerning the first Formation of Languages,
                        and the different Genius of Original and Compounded Languages.</hi> This
                    essay was originally subjoined to the first edition of the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Moral Sentiments. It</hi> is an ingenious and pretty successful attempt to
                    explain the for- mation and progress of language, by means of that species of
                    investigation to which Dugald Stewart has given the ap- propriate name of <hi
                        rend="italic">Theoretical</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Conjectural History
                        ;</hi> and which consists in endeavouring to trace the progress anti
                    vicissitudes of any art or science, partly from such historical facts as have
                    reference to it, and, where facts are wanting, from inferences derived from
                    considering what would be the most natural and probable conduct of mankind un-
                    der the circumstances supposed.</item>
                <item><hi rend="italic">An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of
                        Nations.</hi> The first edition was published at London in 1776, in two
                    volumes 4to. The fourth edition, which was the last revised by the author,
                    appeared in three volumes 8vo, in 1786.</item>
                <item><hi rend="italic">Essays on Philosophical Subjects.</hi> Lond. 1795, 4to.
                    These are the fragments which he exempted from the general destruction of his
                    manuscripts, and which were published by his friends, Dr. Black and Dr. Hutton.
                    In an advertisement prefixed to the publication, the editors state that, when
                    the papers which Dr. Smith had left in their hands were examined, “ the greater
                    number ap- peared to be parts of a plan he once had formed for giving a
                    connected history of the liberal sciences and elegant arts.” “ It is long,” they
                    add, “ since he found it necessary to abandon that plan as far too extensive ;
                    and these parts of it lay beside him neglected until his death. The reader will
                    find in them that happy connection, that full and ac- curate expression, and
                    that clear illustration, which are con- spicuous in the rest of his works; and
                    though it is difficult to add much to the great fame he so justly acquired by
                    his other writings, these will be read with satisfaction and pleasure.” The
                    papers in question comprise, I. fragments of a great work <hi rend="italic">On
                        the Principles which lead and direct Philosophical Inquiries,
                        illustrated</hi> (1) <hi rend="italic">by the History of Astronomy;</hi> (2)
                        <hi rend="italic">by the History of the Ancient Physics; and</hi> (3) <hi
                        rend="italic">by the History of the Ancient Logics and Metaphysics.</hi> II.
                    An essay entitled. <hi rend="italic">Of the Nature of that Imitation which takes
                        place in what are called the imitative Arts.</hi> III. A short tract, <hi
                        rend="italic">Of the Affinity between certain English and Italian
                        Verses.</hi> IV. A disquisition. <hi rend="italic">Of the External
                        Senses.</hi></item>
            </list>
            <p>Of the historical dissertations, the first only, on the <hi rend="italic">History of
                    Astronomy,</hi> seems to be nearly complete. They are all written on the plan of
                the dissertation on the <hi rend="italic">Formation of Languages,</hi> being partly
                theoretical and partly founded on fact. In the essay on the <hi rend="italic"
