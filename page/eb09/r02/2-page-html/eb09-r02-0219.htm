Argentille (or Argantel) appears to be formed from a Welsh name, which the early English writers converted to Goldborough.&nbsp;The French chanson belongs to the early part of the 12th century.&nbsp;It has no direct prose representative. Gaimar’s text was first&nbsp;edited by Hadden (Roxburghe Club, 1828), in the Monumenta&nbsp;Hist. Brit. (1848), and by T. Wright (Caxton Soc., 1850). A&nbsp;French lai on the same subject is included in the Roxburghe and&nbsp;in the Caxton volumes ; it was issued separately by Francisque&nbsp;Michel in 1833. An English poem is also to be found in the&nbsp;Roxburghe volume, and was likewise edited by W. W. Skeat&nbsp;(Early Eng. Text Soc. 1868).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">King Hom. —The primitive English form of the poem is lost, but is represented in the existing chanson de geste (Horn et Rimenhild,&nbsp;12th century). An early version supplied some of the incidents&nbsp;for Richard of Ely’s Gesta Herewardi Sαxoηis (first half of 12th&nbsp;century), which claims to be partly derived from an old book&nbsp;written by Leofric, Hereward’s chaplain at Bourne. English MSS.&nbsp;(in verse) are preserved at the British Museum, Oxford, and Cambridge. Allof, king of Sudenne, is killed by Saracen (Danish)&nbsp;pirates, who also drive away his wife Godylt and turn their son&nbsp;Horn adrift at sea, with Athulf, Fykenild, and ten other children.&nbsp;They land at Westness (Cornwall) and the children are reared by&nbsp;King Aylmer. Horn is banished for a love passage with the king’s&nbsp;daughter, Rymenild, and sails for Ireland under the name of God-mod. He returns with Irish warriors and by himself joins a feast&nbsp;held to celebrate the espousals of Rymenild with a King Mody.&nbsp;Horn, disguised as a pilgrim, drops a ring into Rymenild’s cup with&nbsp;the words “ Drink to Horn of horn.” He defeats Mody and reinstates his mother in Sudenne. Rymenild is carried off by Fykenild,&nbsp;who is ultimately killed by the hero, by whom the lady is rescued.&nbsp;The only copy known of the knightly romance of Horn Childe and&nbsp;Maiden Rimnild is the Auchinleck MS. The story was very&nbsp;popular in Scotland. Horn and Horn Childe have both been printed&nbsp;by Ritson (Ancient Eng. Metr. Rom., 1802, ii., iii.). Francisque&nbsp;Michel has edited Horn et Rimenhild, including the English and&nbsp;Scottish poems (Bannatyne Club, 1845). The Cambridge MS. was&nbsp;edited by J. R. Lumby for the Early Eng. Text Soc. (1866) and by&nbsp;E. Mätzner in Altenglisehe Spraxhρroben (1867), and the Oxford&nbsp;text by C. Horstmann in Herrig’s Aehiυ (1872).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ponthus et la Belle Sidoine. —In this prose romance the soldan of Babylon sends his three sons to seek their fortune at sea. One of&nbsp;them, Broadas, occupies Galicia and kills King Thibor, whose&nbsp;young son Pontus with the other children is sent off in a boat to&nbsp;France. They are wrecked off the coast of Brittany, and the story&nbsp;proceeds very much as in the poem of Horn. Nearly all the names&nbsp;are changed, however, and there are additional knightly episodes.&nbsp;The romance was first printed at Lyons about 1480. A German&nbsp;translation appeared at Augsburg in 1483, and an English version&nbsp;was printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1511.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Anglo-Danish cycle of romance, by reason of its origin and type of adventures, may be fitly supplemented&nbsp;by the stories, eminently English in character, although&nbsp;furnished with an Anglo-Norman setting, which have been&nbsp;called “ outlaw romances.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tales of outlaws form a considerable portion of English fiction, and, as elsewhere, the same incidents occur over and&nbsp;over again, being always attributed to the favourite hero&nbsp;of the day. The oldest was that of Hereward the Saxon,&nbsp;whose exploits against William were renowned in prose&nbsp;and verse soon after his own time. Most of the outlaw&nbsp;stories remain in ballad form ; a prose example is the&nbsp;French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fulk Fitzwarin</span><span class="font1"> (about 1320), descriptive of outlaw&nbsp;life in the Welsh marches and other parts of England,&nbsp;Spain, &lt;fcc.,—an embellished record of actual events from&nbsp;1201 to 1203. We learn that Payn Peverel, having overcome a devil that tenanted the body of a Cornish giant,&nbsp;Geomagog, who haunts a ruined British village in Shropshire, builds a castle near the place with the assistance of&nbsp;his kinsfolk. A certain Melette Peverel marries Warin de&nbsp;Meez, and their son Fulk Fitzwarin is himself the father&nbsp;of five sons, who go through scenes many of which are&nbsp;obviously suggested by the Charlemagne </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chansons,</span><span class="font1"> such&nbsp;as the fatal chess-board quarrel, the taunting of Ogier by&nbsp;Roland, &lt;fcc. The five brothers are outlawed and seek&nbsp;adventures. One of their followers, John de Rampayne,&nbsp;resembles Friar Tuck in his skill in playing, singing, and&nbsp;the use of the quarterstaff. The story ends with the submission and pardon of Fulk, the eldest of the brothers,&nbsp;the death of his wife Mahaud, his marriage with Clarice&nbsp;de Auberville, and his subsequent blindness,—all real historical events. It was the first wife of Fulk who became&nbsp;a personage as Maid Marian in the Robin Hood stories&nbsp;and in the plays of Munday and Chettle. The romance&nbsp;was first published by Francisque Michel in 1840, by T.&nbsp;Wright in 1855 (Warton Club), and at the end of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ralph&nbsp;de Coggeshall</span><span class="font1"> (Rolls Series, 1875).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The exploits of the earlier outlaws, Hereward and Fulk Fitzwarin, reappear under the name of Robin Hood </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v.).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The extensive ballad literature relating to the last and&nbsp;his companions Maid Marian, Friar Tuck, Little John, &lt;fcc.,&nbsp;needs only a passing reference. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Robin Hood,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a prose rendering of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geste of Robyn Hode</span><span class="font1"> (Wynkyn&nbsp;de Worde, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 1495), is reproduced by W. J. Thoms in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Early Eng. Prose Romances,</span><span class="font1"> 1858.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the most popular stories connected with the Robin Hood cycle is Gamelyn (e. 1340), sometimes inserted among Chaucer’s&nbsp;Canterbury Tales. Here three sons are left equal shares in their&nbsp;father’s property, —Gamelyn, the youngest, being under the charge&nbsp;of the eldest, John, who neglects him. At the age of sixteen he&nbsp;gains a ram at a wrestling match and invites the spectators home.&nbsp;After the guests retire John and Gamelyn quarrel. The latter is&nbsp;imprisoned, but released by Adam the Spencer, an old servant, and&nbsp;the two escape together. Gamelyn is made king of the outlaws and&nbsp;John becomes sheriff. Gamelyn is captured, but is bailed out by his&nbsp;other brother, Ote. Finally, John is hanged by Gamelyn. The&nbsp;tale was used by T. Lodge for Rosalynde (1590) and dramatized by&nbsp;Shakespeare in As You Like It (ed. W. W. Skeat, 1884).</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">The works of this class are of less importance than those which belong to the great cycles ; for, indeed, there are few&nbsp;which have not been drawn somehow into one or pther of&nbsp;these last. Amongst the most striking we have </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pierre de&nbsp;Provence et la Belle Maguelonne,</span><span class="font1"> a story of love, adventure,&nbsp;and magic, which existed in Provençal verse at the end of&nbsp;the 12th century, but was first compiled in French prose&nbsp;in 1457 (the text being printed at Lyons about 1478).&nbsp;It was very popular in Spain, and a Spanish translation&nbsp;appeared as a quarto volume at Toledo in 1526.—A similar&nbsp;romance is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paris et Vienne,</span><span class="font1"> belonging apparently to the&nbsp;first half of the 15th century ; the first edition was printed&nbsp;at Antwerp, by Gerard Leeuw, in 1487, five years after the&nbsp;appearance of an Italian translation (Treviso, 1482), and&nbsp;two years after Caxton had issued an English version&nbsp;(Westminster, 1485).—Another French romance (better&nbsp;corresponding to the modern use of the word) is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jean de&nbsp;Paris</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 1535), written by Pierre de la Sippade&nbsp;(1490-1500). It is a pleasant fiction, full of disguises and&nbsp;surprises like the works of G. P. R. James, and may be&nbsp;compared with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le petit Jehan de Saintrê</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1517),&nbsp;written by Antoine de la Sale about 1470, in which we&nbsp;find a true picture of the manners of the French court&nbsp;in the first half of the 15th century.—The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trois Filz de&nbsp;Roys</span><span class="font1"> is a heavy and dull romance written in Flanders late&nbsp;in the 15th century.—A work of far superior order is&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tirant lo Blanch,</span><span class="font1"> written in the Valencian language in&nbsp;the 15th century by Joannot Martorell. This was printed,&nbsp;with the fourth book added after the author’s death, at&nbsp;Valencia in 1490, and has the honour of being the first&nbsp;romance which came from the Spanish press. The author&nbsp;professes to derive his stories from English sources, but&nbsp;he seems to be indebted only to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Guy of Warwick</span><span class="font1"> for some</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
