                <p><label>ROBERT</label> (1275-1343), king of Naples, was the son of Charles IL,
                    duke of Anjou and king of Naples, and in his youth took part in several
                    expeditions to Sicily with the object of wresting the island from Frederick III.
                    of Aragon. But his efforts, like those of his father and grandfather, proved
                    fruitless, and the Angevins were compelled at last to agree to the peace of
                    Caltabellotta (1302). On the death of Charles in 1309 Robert succeeded to the
                    throne, although his nephew Caroberto (Carlo Roberto), son of his elder brother
                    Charles Martel, who had died before his father, had a prior claim. Hewas
                    crowned by Pope Clement V. at Avignon, and on the descent into Italy of the
                    emperor Henry VII. was appointed papal vicar in Romagna to resist the
                    imperialists; thenceforth he became the recognized leader of the Guelphs or papal
                    faction in Italy and took part in all the wars against the Ghibellines. On various
                    occasions he obtained for himself or his sons the suzerainty over Rome,
                    Florence, and other cities, and was regarded as the most powerful Italian prince
                    of his day. Pope John XXII. created him papal vicar in Italy against the emperor
                    Louis the Bavarian. In r32o Robert summoned his kinsman Philip V. of France to
                    Italy, and he waged war against Sicily once more from 1325 to rj4r, but failed
                    to drive out the Aragonese. He died in Γ343, just as he was about to lead
                    another expedition to the island. Robert was a man of learning, devoted to</p>

               <p>literature, and a generous patron of literary men: he befriended the poet
                    Petrarch, who admired the king so greatly as to express the wish to see him lord
                    of all Italy; while Boccaccio celebrated the virtues and charms of Robert’s
                    natural daughter Maria, under the name of Fiammetta. Dante was perhaps too
                    severe on Robert, whom he described as a <hi rend="italic">re da sermone</hi>
                    (word king), and contemporary critics accused him of covetousness, a fault
                    partly excused by his pressing need of money to pay the expenses of his
                    perpetual wars. In spite of his power and influence, his position as a leader of
                    the Guelphs was greatly shaken during the latter years of his reign, while at
                    home he was never able completely to subjugate his rebellious barons.</p>
