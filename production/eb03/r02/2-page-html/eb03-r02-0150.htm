<p><span class="font2">al</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">o the fears of the people were excited by a prophecy ſaid to be taken out of the Sybilline books, that the&nbsp;Gauls and Greeks ſhould one day be in poſſeſſion of&nbsp;Rome. This prophecy, however, the ſenate found means&nbsp;to elude, as they pretended, by burying two Gauls and&nbsp;two Greeks alive, and then telling the multitude that&nbsp;the Gauls and Greeks were now in the poſſeſſion of&nbsp;Rome. The difficulties which ſuperſtition had raiſed&nbsp;being thus ſurmounted, the Romans made vaſt preparations againſt the Gauls, whom they ſeem to have dreaded above all other nations. Some ſay that the number&nbsp;of forces raiſed by the Romans on this occaſion amounted to no fewer than 8oo,ooc men. Of this incredible&nbsp;multitude 248,000 foot and 26,000 horſe were Romans or Campanians ; nevertheleſs, the Gauls, with only&nbsp;&lt;fo,ooo foot and 20,000 horſe, forced a paſſage through&nbsp;Hetruria, and took the road towards Rome. Here&nbsp;they had the good fortune at firſt to defeat one of the&nbsp;Roman armies; but being ſoon after met by two others,&nbsp;they were utterly defeated, with the loſs of more than&nbsp;50,0co of their number. The Romans then entered&nbsp;their country, which they cruelly ravaged ; but a plague&nbsp;breaking out in their army, obliged them to return&nbsp;home. This was followed by a new war, in which&nbsp;thoſe Gauls who inhabited Inſubria and Liguria were&nbsp;totally ſubdued, and their country reduced to a Roman&nbsp;province. Theſe conqueſts were followed by that of&nbsp;Iſtria ; Dimalum, a city of importance in Illyricum ;&nbsp;and Pharos, an iſland in the Adriatic ſea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ſecond Punic war for ſome time retarded the conqueſts of the Romans, and even threatened their&nbsp;ſtate with entire deſtruction ; but Hannibal being at&nbsp;laſt recalled from Italy, and entirely defeated at Zama,&nbsp;they made peace upon ſuch advantageous terms as gave&nbsp;them an entire ſuperiority over that republic, which&nbsp;they not long after entirely ſubverted, as has been related in the hiſtory of </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Carthage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The ſucceſsful iſſue of the ſecond Punic war had greatly increaſed the extent of the Roman empire.&nbsp;They were now maſters of all Sicily, the Mediterranean iſlands, and great part of Spain ; and, through&nbsp;the diſſenſions of the Aſiatic ſtates with the king of Macedon, a pretence was now found for carrying their&nbsp;arms into theſe parts. The Gauls in the mean time,&nbsp;however, continued their incurſions, but now ceaſed to&nbsp;be formidable ; while the kings of Macedon, through&nbsp;miſconduct, were firſt obliged to ſubmit to a disadvantageous peace, and' at laſt totally ſubdued (ſee </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Macedon).</span><span class="font2"> The reduction of Macedon was ſoon followed&nbsp;by that of all Greece, either by the name of allies or&nbsp;otherwiſe : while Antiochus the Great, to whom Hannibal fled for protection, by an unſucce</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">sful war firſt&nbsp;gave the Romans a footing in Aſia (ſee </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Syria).</span><span class="font2"> The&nbsp;Spaniards and Gauls continued to be the moſt obſtinate&nbsp;enemies. The former, particularly, were rather exterminated than reduced ; and even this required the ut∙&nbsp;moſt care and vigilance of Scipio Æmilianus; the conqueror of Garthage, to execute. See </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Spain</span><span class="font2"> and Nc<sup>τ</sup>-</span><span class="font0">MANTIA.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Thus the Romans attained to a height of power fu-τ&gt;erior to any other nation in the world ; bfιt now a ſedition broke out, which we may ſay was never terminated but with the overthrow of the republic. This had its origin from Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, deſcen-ded from a family which» though plebeian, was as illu^</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">ſtrious as any in the commonwealth. His father had been twice raiſed to the con</span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ulate, was a great general,&nbsp;and had been honoured with two triumphs. But he&nbsp;was ſtill more renowned for his domeſtic virtues and pro·&nbsp;bity, than for his birth or valour. He married the&nbsp;daughter of the firſt Africanus, ſaid to be the pattern&nbsp;of her ſex, and the prodigy of her age ; and had by&nbsp;her ſeveral children, of whom three only arrived to maturity of age, Tiberius Gracchus, Caius Gracchus, and&nbsp;a daughter named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sempronia,</span><span class="font2"> who was married to the&nbsp;ſecond Africanus. Tiberius, the eldeſt, was deemed&nbsp;the moſt accompliſhed youth in Rome, with reſpect to&nbsp;the qualities both of body and mind. His extraordina∙&nbsp;ry talents were heightened by a noble air, an engaging&nbsp;countenance, and all thoſe winning graces of nature&nbsp;which recommend merit. He made his firſt campaigns&nbsp;under his brother-in-law, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf on&nbsp;all occaſions h,y his courage, and by the prudence of his&nbsp;conduct. When he returned to Rome, he applied himſelf to the ſtudy of eloquence ; and at 30 years old&nbsp;was accounted the beſt orator of his age. He married&nbsp;the daughter of Appius Claudius, who had been formerly conſul and cenſor, and was then prince of the ſenate. He continued for </span><span class="font1">ſ</span><span class="font2">ome time in the ſentiments&nbsp;both of his own and his wife’s family, and ſupported&nbsp;the intereſts of the patricians ; but without openly attacking the popular faction. He was the chief author&nbsp;and negociator of that ſhameful neceſſary peace with&nbsp;the Numantines ; which the ſenate, with the utmoſt injuſtice, diſannulled, and condemned the conſul, the quæftor, and all the officers who had ſigned it, to be delivered up to the Numantines (ſee Nu </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">manti a).</span><span class="font2"> The&nbsp;people indeed, out of eſteem for Gracchus, would not&nbsp;ſuffer him to be ſacrificed : but, however, he had juſt&nbsp;reaſon to complain, both of the ſenate and people,&nbsp;for paſſing ſo ſcandalous a decree againſt his general&nbsp;and himſelf, and breaking a treaty whereby the lives of&nbsp;ſo many citizens had been ſaved. But as the ſenate</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">had chiefly promoted ſuch baſe and iniquitous proceedings, he reſolved in due time to ſhow his refent-ment againſt the party which had contributed moſt to his diſgrace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In order to this, he ſtood for the tribuneſhip of the people ; which he no ſooner obtained, than he reſolved&nbsp;to attack the nobility in the moſt tender part. They&nbsp;had uſurped lands unjuſtly ; cultivated them by ſlaves,&nbsp;to the great detriment of the public ; and had lived for&nbsp;about 250 years in open defiance to the Licinian law,&nbsp;by which it was enacted that no citizen ſhould po</span><span class="font1">ſſ</span><span class="font2">eſs&nbsp;more than 500 acres. This law Tib. Gracchus reſoL&nbsp;ved to revive, and by that means revenge himſelf on&nbsp;the patricians. But it was not revenge alone which&nbsp;prompted him to embark in ſo dangerous an attempt,&nbsp;It is pretended, that his mother Cornelia animated him&nbsp;to undertake ſomething worthy both of his and her family. The reproaches of his mother, the authority of&nbsp;ſome great men, namely of his father-in-law Appius&nbsp;Claudius,, of P. Craſſns the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pontifex maximus,</span><span class="font2"> and of&nbsp;Mutius Scævola, the moſt learned civilian in Rome, and&nbsp;his natural thrift after glory, joined with an eager deſire&nbsp;of revenge, conſpired to draw him into this moſt unfortunate ſeheme.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The law, as he firſt drew it up, was very mild : for it only enacted, that thoſe who poſſeſſed more than çoo&nbsp;acres of land ſhould part with the overplus ; and that</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
