<p><span class="font1">cases the imposts were paid to the new master instead of to the fisc. In the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries the cultivators were attached&nbsp;to the soil </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(coloni, ascripticii;</span><span class="font1"> see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Serfdom),</span><span class="font1"> in the interests of the&nbsp;fiscus; it has been supposed, on insufficient grounds, that this&nbsp;serfdom was abolished for a time by Leo III., though it is probable&nbsp;that the condition of the peasants was largely changed by the&nbsp;invasions of the 7th century. In any case the system of compulsory&nbsp;attachment of peasants to their lands remained in force, and the&nbsp;class of adscripticü (i»'a7rô7pa&lt;£oi) existed till the latest times. The&nbsp;chief sources for agrarian conditions are, besides the imperial laws,&nbsp;monastic records, among which may be mentioned as specially&nbsp;valuable those of the Monastery of Lemboi near Smyrna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Army and Navy.—</span><span class="font1">The general principle of the military defence of the Empire in the 4th century consisted in large&nbsp;forces stationary on the frontiers, and reserve forces, stationed&nbsp;in the interior provinces, which could be moved to any point&nbsp;that was in danger. Thus the army was composed of (1) the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">limitanei,</span><span class="font1"> frontier-troops (under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">duces)</span><span class="font1">, and (2) reserve forces&nbsp;(under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">magistri militum)</span><span class="font1"> of two denominations, (a) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">palatini&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and (6) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitatenses.</span><span class="font1"> The limitanei were the more numerous;&nbsp;it has been estimated that if they numbered about 350,000,&nbsp;the comitatenses and palatini together amounted to less than&nbsp;200,000. It is to be noted that for the old legion of 6000 men&nbsp;a smaller legion of 1000 had been substituted, and that the proportion of cavalry to infantry was small. In the 6th century&nbsp;the fundamental principles of the system were the same; but&nbsp;the cavalry had become a much more important branch of the&nbsp;service, and in the wars of Belisarius the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">foederati,</span><span class="font1"> barbarian&nbsp;mercenaries of various races, commanded by their own chiefs,&nbsp;played a great rôle. The peasants of Illyria and Thrace, the&nbsp;mountaineers of southern Asia Minor still supply an important&nbsp;part of the army, but the number of barbarians (Heruli, Vandals, Goths, Slavs, Arabs, &amp;c.) is much larger. Solidity and&nbsp;a corresponding want of mobility characterized at this time&nbsp;both cavalry and infantry; their great merit was straight and&nbsp;rapid shooting: Belisarius ascribed his. success in Italy to the&nbsp;excellence of the archery. It is remarkable with what small&nbsp;forces (not more than 25,000) the first conquest of Italy was&nbsp;achieved, though Belisarius was far from being a military genius&nbsp;and the discipline in his army was flagrantly defective.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Frontier Defence.—</span><span class="font1"> Justinian carried out on the frontiers and in the exposed provinces a carefully devised and expensive system of&nbsp;defensive works. Fortified towns along the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">limes</span><span class="font1"> were connected&nbsp;by intervening forts, and at some distance behind was a second&nbsp;line of more important fortresses more strongly garrisoned, which&nbsp;furnished both a second barrier and places of refuge for the inhabitants of the open country. There was an elaborate system of&nbsp;signals by which the garrisons of the front stations eould announce&nbsp;not only the imminence of a hostile invasion, but the number&nbsp;and character of the enemy. In North Africa there are abundant&nbsp;remains of the forts of the 6th and 7th centuries, displaying the&nbsp;military architecture of the period and the general frontier system.&nbsp;The typical fortress had three defences: the wall flanked by square&nbsp;towers of three storeys; at a few yards’ distance a second wall of&nbsp;stone; and outside a deep foss about 20 yds. wide, with vertical&nbsp;sides, filled with water, and along its edge a rampart of earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have already seen how the disasters and losses of the 7th century led to a radical change in the military organization, and&nbsp;how the Empire was divided into themes. . The preponderant&nbsp;influence which Asia Minor won and retained till the nth century&nbsp;is reflected in the military establishment, which mainly depended&nbsp;on the Asiatic provinces. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">strategos</span><span class="font1"> of a large theme commanded&nbsp;a corps of 10,000 and the scheme of the divisions and subordinate&nbsp;commands has a remarkable resemblance to the organization of&nbsp;some of the armies of modern Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The recorded scheme was probably not uniform in all the themes, and varied at different periods. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thema</span><span class="font1"> (corps) consisted of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">2 turmai</span><span class="font1"> (brigades) under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">turmarchai;</span><span class="font1"> the turma of 5 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">banda</span><span class="font1"> (regiments), each under a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">drungarios</span><span class="font1"> (colonel); the banaon of 5 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pent-arkhiai</span><span class="font1"> (companies) under a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">kometes</span><span class="font1"> (captain). The pentarkhia,&nbsp;containing 200 men, had 5 subdivisions under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pentekontarkhai&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(lieutenants); and there was a smaller unit of ten men under the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dekarkhes</span><span class="font1"> (corporal). The total strength in the 9th century was&nbsp;120,000; in Justinian’s time it was reckoned at 150,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Distinct from the military forces </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{pk^ara.)</span><span class="font1"> of the provinces were the forces (rAy/xara) stationed in or near the capital. The most&nbsp;important of these were the Scholae and the Excubitores. The&nbsp;Scnolarian troops were in early times under the Master of Offices,&nbsp;but subsequently their chief officer, the Domestic of the Schools,&nbsp;became the highest military commander in the Empire next to the&nbsp;Strategos of the Anatolic Theme. In war, when the emperor did&nbsp;not assume the chief command himself, he might entrust it to any&nbsp;commander, and he often entrusted it to the Domestic. In the&nbsp;nth century, after the conquest of Bulgaria, there were two&nbsp;Domestics, one for the east and one for the west, and under&nbsp;Alexius Comnenus the Domestic of the west received the title Great&nbsp;Domestic. Under the Palaeologi the Great Domestic was superior&nbsp;in rank to all other ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides the Scholarians, and the Excubitores (who had been organized in the 5th century), there were the regiments of the&nbsp;Hikanatoi, the Anthmos and the Numeroi. The Numcroi were&nbsp;foot-soldiers. The Optimatoi, also infantry, properly belonged »to&nbsp;the same category, though they were constituted as a theme. It&nbsp;is to be observed that the demes or corporations of Constantinople&nbsp;were partly organized as militia, and were available for purposes of&nbsp;defence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The great difference between this Byzantine army and that of the earlier Empire is that its strength (like that of the feudal armies&nbsp;of the West) lay entirely in cavalry, which the successors of Hera-clius and the 1 saurian emperors developed to great perfection.&nbsp;The few contingents of foot were quite subsidiary. The army&nbsp;was free from the want of discipline which was so notable in the&nbsp;6th century; it was maintained in Asia Minor, which was the great&nbsp;recruiting ground, by a system of military holdings of land (an extension of the old Roman system of assigning lands ¡n the frontier&nbsp;districts to federate barbarians and to veterans). The conditions&nbsp;of the marauding expeditions and guerilla warfare, continuously&nbsp;carried on against and by the Saracens in the 8th, 9th and iotn&nbsp;centuries, were carefully studied by generals and tacticians, and&nbsp;we possess the theory of the Byzantine methods in a treatise composed by the emperor Nicephorus. Phocas, and edited by one of his&nbsp;pupils. Every detail of an inroad into Saracen territory is regulated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the 8th and 9th centuries there was a system of signals by which an approaching Saracen incursion was announced to Constantinople&nbsp;from the Cilician frontier. The news was flashed across Asia Minor&nbsp;by eight beacon fires. The first beacon was at Lulon (which commanded the pass between Tyana and the Cilician gates), the last&nbsp;on Mt. Auxentius in Bithynia. When this fire appeared, a light&nbsp;was kindled in the pharos of the imperial palace at Constantinople.&nbsp;The system was discontinued in the reign of Michael III., probably&nbsp;after the capture of Lulon by the enemy in 860, and was not renewed, though Lulon was recovered in 877. It should be noted&nbsp;that this famous telegraphic system was only an application on a&nbsp;large scale of the frontier signalling referred to above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The loss of a great part of Asia Minor to the Seljuks, and the disorganization of the provinces which they did not acquire, seriously&nbsp;weakened the army, and the emperors had recourse more and more&nbsp;to foreign mercenaries and barbarian auxiliaries. The employment&nbsp;of Scandinavians had begun in the 10th century, and in 988 was&nbsp;formed the Varangian guard, consisting chiefly of English adventurers.&nbsp;In the arsenal of Venice are two lions, which were transported from&nbsp;the Peiraeus, inscribed with obscure Runic characters, carved perhaps by Scandinavians in the army of Basil II. Under Michael IV.&nbsp;the famous Norwegian prince Harald Hardrada (described by&nbsp;a Greek writer as “ Araltcs, son of the king of Varangia ”) fought&nbsp;for the Empire in Sicily and in Bulgaria. But in the latter part&nbsp;of the 1 rth century foreign mercenaries greatly increased in numters&nbsp;and importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The note of the Byzantine army was efficiency, and nowhere is the immeasurable superiority of the civilization of the Eastern&nbsp;Empire to the contemporary states of Europe more apparent.&nbsp;The theory’ of military science was always studied and taught;&nbsp;constant practice, interpreting and correcting theories, safeguarded&nbsp;it against pedantry”, and a class of magnificent staff officers were&nbsp;trained, wno in the 10th century were the terror of the enemy.&nbsp;The particular tactics of the various foes whom they had to face&nbsp;were critically studied. We have a series of military text-books,&nbsp;from the time of Anastasius I. to that of Basil IL, in which we can&nbsp;learn their principles and methods. In this army there was plenty&nbsp;of courage, and distinct professional pride, but no love of fighting&nbsp;for fighting’s sake, nor the spirit which in western Europe developed&nbsp;into chivalry. . The Byzantines despised such ideas as characteristic of barbarians who had physical strength and no brains. The&nbsp;object of a good general, as Leo VI. shows in his important treatise&nbsp;on Tactics, was in their opinion not to win a great battle, but to&nbsp;attain success without the risks and losses of a great battle. The&nbsp;same author criticizes the military character of the Franks. Paying&nbsp;a tribute to their fearlessness, he points out their want of discipline,&nbsp;the haphazard nature of their array and order of battle, their&nbsp;eagerness to attack before the word was given, their want of faculty&nbsp;for strategy or tactical combinations, their incapacity for operations&nbsp;on difficult ground, the ease with which they could be deceived&nbsp;by simple artifices, their carelessness in pitching camps, and their&nbsp;lack of a proper intelligence department. These criticisms, borne&nbsp;out by all we know of feudal warfare, illustrate the contrast betw’een&nbsp;a western host, with its three great “ battles,” rushing headlong&nbsp;at the foe, and the Byzantine army, with its large number of&nbsp;small units, co-operating in perfect harmony, under a commander&nbsp;who had been trained in military’ science, had a definite plan in his&nbsp;head, and could rely on all his subordinates for strict and intelligent&nbsp;obedience.</span></p>
