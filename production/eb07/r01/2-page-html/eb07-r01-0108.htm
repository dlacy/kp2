Bencoolen river is the limit on the&nbsp;south-east. The other principal rivers are the Laye, the&nbsp;Pally, and the Sunzedano, on all of which the English have&nbsp;factories.

<p><span class="font0">RELAND, Adrian, an eminent orientalist, born at Ryp, in North Holland, in 1676. During three years’ study under&nbsp;Surenhusius, he made uncommon progress in the Hebrew,&nbsp;Syriac, Chaldaic, and Arabic languages, and these languages&nbsp;were always his favourite study. In 1701, he was, by the&nbsp;recommendation of King William, appointed professor of&nbsp;oriental languages and ecclesiastical antiquities in the university of Utrecht, and died of the small-pox in 1718. He&nbsp;was distinguished by his modesty, humanity, and learning ;&nbsp;and carried on a correspondence with the most eminent&nbsp;scholars of his time. His principal works are, 1. An excellent Description of Palestine ; 2. Five Dissertations on the&nbsp;Medals of the ancient Hebrpws and several other dissertations on different subjects ; 3. An Introduction to the Hebrew Grammar 4. The Antiquit ies of the ancient Hebrews ;&nbsp;and, 5. On +“ Mallommedan Religion. These works are&nbsp;all writtei&lt; in Latir</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RELICS, in the Church of Rome, the remains of the bodies or clothes of saints or martyrs, and the instruments by which they were put to death, devoutly preserved, in honour of their memory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The respect which was justly due to the martyrs and the teachers of the Christian faith increased in the course of time&nbsp;almost to adoration ; and at length all but divine honour&nbsp;was really paid both to departed saints and to relics of holy&nbsp;men or holy things. Such was the rage for them at one&nbsp;time, that, as MabUlon, a Benedictine, justly complains, the&nbsp;altars were loaded with suspected relics, numerous spurious&nbsp;ones being everywhere offered to the piety and devotion of&nbsp;the faithful. He adds, too, that bones are often consecrated, which, so far from belonging to saints, probably do not&nbsp;belong to Christians. From the catacombs numerous relics&nbsp;have been taken, and yet it is not known who were the&nbsp;persons interred therein. In the eleventh century, relics&nbsp;were tried by fire, when those which did not consume were&nbsp;reckoned genuine, and the rest not. Relics were, and still&nbsp;are, sometimes preserved on the altars whereon mass is celebrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Romanists plead antiquity in behalf of the respect paid to relics. The Manicheans, say they, out of hatred to&nbsp;the flesh, which they considered as an evil principle, refused&nbsp;to honour the relics of saints ; and this is reckoned a kind&nbsp;of proof that the Christians in the first ages did so. We&nbsp;know, indeed, that the touching of linen cloths on relics,&nbsp;from an opinion of some extraordinary virtue derived therefrom, was as ancient as the first ages ; there being a hole&nbsp;made expressly for the purpose in the coffins of the forty&nbsp;martyrs at Constantinople. The honouring the relics of&nbsp;saints, on which the Church of Rome afterwards founded&nbsp;her superstitious and lucrative use of them, as objects of devotion, as a kind of charms or amulets, and as instruments&nbsp;of pretended miracles, appears to have originated in a very&nbsp;ancient custom which prevailed amongst Christians, of assembling at the cemeteries or burying-places of the martyrs, for the purpose of commemorating them, and of performing divine worship. When the profession of Christianity obtained the protection of the civil government, under Constantine the Great, stately churches were erected&nbsp;over their sepulchres, and their names and memories were&nbsp;treated with every possible token of affection and respect.&nbsp;This reverence, however, gradually exceeded all reasonable&nbsp;bounds ; and those prayers and religious services which&nbsp;were performed over their tombs were thought to have a&nbsp;peculiar sanctity and virtue. Hence the practice, which&nbsp;afterwards obtained, of depositing relics of saints and of&nbsp;martyrs under the altars in all churches. This practice was&nbsp;then thought of such importance, that St Ambrose would&nbsp;not consecrate a church because it had no relics ; and the&nbsp;council of Constantinople ordained, that those altars should&nbsp;be demolished under which there were not found any relics.&nbsp;The rage of procuring relics for this and other purposes of a&nbsp;similar nature became so excessive, that in 386 the Emperor&nbsp;Theodosius the Great was obliged to pass a law, forbidding&nbsp;the people to dig up the bodies of the martyrs, and to traffic&nbsp;in their remains. Such was the origin of that respect for&nbsp;sacred relics, which, when perverted afterwards, became&nbsp;the occasion of innumerable processions, pilgrimages, and&nbsp;miracles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RELIEVO, or Relief, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sculpture,</span><span class="font0"> is the projection or standing out of a figure which arises prominently from the&nbsp;ground or plane on which it is formed, whether that figure&nbsp;be cut w<sup>r</sup>ith the chisel, moulded, or cast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There are three kinds or degrees of relievo ; alto, basso, and demi-relievo. The alto-relievo, called also </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">high-relief,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is when the figure is formed after nature, and projects as&nbsp;much as the life. Basso-relievo, bas-relief, is when the&nbsp;work is raised a little from the ground, as in medals and&nbsp;the frontispieces of buildings, but particularly in the histories, festoons, foliages, and other ornaments of friezes. Demi-relievo is when one half of the figure rises from the&nbsp;plane. When, in a basso-relievo, there are parts that stand&nbsp;clear out, detached from the rest, the work is called a demi-basso. In architecture, the relief or projection of the ornaments ought always to be proportioned to the magnitude of&nbsp;the building it adorns, and to the distance at which it is to&nbsp;be viewed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Relievo, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Relief,</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Painting,</span><span class="font0"> is the degree of boldness with which the figures appear, at a due distance, to stand out from the ground of the painting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The relievo depends much upon the depth of the shadow and the strength of the light ; or in the height of the different colours, bordering upon one another, and particularly&nbsp;on the difference of the colour of the figure from that of the&nbsp;ground. Thus, when the light is so disposed as to make&nbsp;the nearest parts of the figure advance, and is well diffused&nbsp;on the masses, yet insensibly diminishing, and terminating&nbsp;in a large spacious shadow, brought off insensibly, the relievo is said to be bold, and the clear-obscure well understood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RELIGION (Religio) is a Latin word, derived, according to Cicero, @@<sup>1</sup> from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">relegere,</span><span class="font0"> to reconsider ; but, according to Servius and most modem grammarians, from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">religare,</span><span class="font0"> to&nbsp;bind fast. The reason assigned by the Roman orator for&nbsp;deducing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">religio</span><span class="font0"> from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">relego,</span><span class="font0"> is in these words : “ Qui au-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
