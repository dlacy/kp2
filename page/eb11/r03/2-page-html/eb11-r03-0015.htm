<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RICHELIEU, ARMAND JEAN DU PLESSIS DE, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cardinal </span><span class="font1">(1585-1642), French statesman, was born of an ancient family&nbsp;of the lesser nobility of Poitou. The original name of the family&nbsp;was Du Plessis, but in the 15th century a younger branch&nbsp;obtained by marriage the estate of Richelieu with its strong&nbsp;castle surrounded by the waters of the Mable, and took the name&nbsp;of Du Plessis de Richelieu. The family produced not a few&nbsp;turbulent warriors during the Hundred Years’ War, and the&nbsp;cardinal’s father, François du Plessis, seigneur de Richelieu,&nbsp;began his career by killing the murderer of his elder brother and&nbsp;then fighting through the wars of religion, first as a favourite&nbsp;of Henry III., and after his death under Henry IV. He was a&nbsp;typical fighting gentleman of the period. The mother of the&nbsp;cardinal, Susanne de La Porte, belonged to a family of the&nbsp;magistrature, her father, François de La Porte, being one of the&nbsp;first advocates of the parlement of Paris. Armand was the third&nbsp;son and was born in Paris on the 9th of September 1585. When&nbsp;he was five years old his father died while assisting at the siege&nbsp;of Paris (on the 10th of July 1590); and his mother was left&nbsp;with five children and the estate heavily in debt. By care and&nbsp;economy, however, aided by generous royal grants, she was&nbsp;enabled to pay off mortgages and to bring up the children in a&nbsp;way befitting their rank. At the age of nine Armand was sent&nbsp;to Paris to the College of Navarre, where he passed with credit&nbsp;the regular courses in grammar and philosophy, and then&nbsp;entered a “ finishing academy ” which prepared the sons of&nbsp;nobles for the life of a courtier or a cavalier. But his training&nbsp;for a military career was suddenly cut short by the refusal of&nbsp;his elder brother, Alphonse, to accept the office of bishop of&nbsp;Luçon. The right of preferment to that see had been given&nbsp;to the Richelieu family by Henry III. as a reward for the&nbsp;services of Armand’s father, and the family drained its revenues&nbsp;for private use. When the cathedral chapter found courage&nbsp;to oppose this and opened suit to recover the ecclesiastical&nbsp;revenues for ecclesiastical purposes, Richelieu’s mother proposed&nbsp;to make her second son, Alphonse, bishop. He defeated this&nbsp;scheme, however, by becoming a monk of the Grande Chartreuse,&nbsp;and Armand, whose health was rather feeble in any case for a&nbsp;military career, was induced to propose himself for the priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1606, at the age of twenty-one, Richèlieu was nominated bishop of Luçon by Henry IV. As he was almost five years&nbsp;under the canonical age, he was obliged </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">go to Rome to obtain&nbsp;a dispensation and was consecrated there in April 1607. In&nbsp;the winter of 1608 Richelieu went out to his poverty-stricken&nbsp;little bishopric, and for the next six years devoted himself&nbsp;seriously to his episcopal duties. He became favourably known&nbsp;among the zealous reformers of the church, and it was during&nbsp;this stage of his career that he made a friend of Father Joseph.&nbsp;Meanwhile he was impatiently waiting for an opening to a larger&nbsp;career. This came in 1614 when he was elected by the clergy&nbsp;of Poitou to the last States-general which met before the&nbsp;Revolution. In this he attracted the favourable attention of&nbsp;Marie de’ Medici, the queen-mother, and was chosen at its close&nbsp;to present the address of the clergy embodying its petitions&nbsp;and resolutions. After the States-general was dissolved he&nbsp;remained in Paris, and the next year he became almoner to&nbsp;Anne of Austria, the child-queen of Louis XIII. Then, by&nbsp;adroit courtly intrigue and* faithful service to Concini, he was&nbsp;appointed in 1616 a secretary of state to the king. But he owed&nbsp;all to Concini, and his taste of power ended with the murder&nbsp;of his patron on the 24th of August 1617.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reign which Richelieu was to dominate so absolutely began with his exile from the court. He had, however, already shown&nbsp;his ability, his firmness, and his diplomatic skill, and conducted&nbsp;the negotiations on the part of the queen-mother with Luynes,&nbsp;the king’s representative. Then, as he had incurred too much&nbsp;of the odium of a creature of Concini to hope for royal favour,&nbsp;he resigned himself to the post of chief adviser to Marie de’&nbsp;Medici in her exile at Blois. Here he sought to ingratiate&nbsp;himself with Luynes and the king by reporting minutely the&nbsp;actions of AIarie and by protestations of loyalty. As this ungrateful work brought no reward, Richelieu, in spite of the&nbsp;earnest entreaties of the queen-mother, retired once more to&nbsp;his bishopric. But the king, while approving his conduct, was&nbsp;still suspicious of him, and he was exiled to Avignon, along with&nbsp;his brother and brother-in-law, on the 7th of April 1618. There&nbsp;he lived in discreet, if melancholy retirement, writing “ A Defence&nbsp;of the Main Principles of the Catholic Faith,” and had apparently&nbsp;little hope of a further political career when the escape of Marie&nbsp;de’ Medici from Blois, on the 22nd of February 1619, again opened&nbsp;paths for his ambition. Luynes and the king recalled him to&nbsp;the post at Angoulême with the queen-mother, who received&nbsp;him ungraciously but who soon yielded to his judgment and&nbsp;allowed him </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">sign the treaty of Angoulême with the Cardinal&nbsp;de la Rochefoucauld, acting for the king. By this treaty Marie&nbsp;was given liberty to live wherever she wished, and the government of Anjou and OfNormandywithseveral Castleswasentrusted&nbsp;to her. The bishop of Luçon was led to believe that the king&nbsp;would recommend him for a cardinalate, but, if we may trust&nbsp;the evidence, Luynes secretly opposed the request, and it was&nbsp;not until after his death that Richelieu was made a cardinal&nbsp;by Pope Gregory XV., on the 5th of Septfcmber 1622. His&nbsp;rank in the church was due to his skill in intrigue with Marie&nbsp;de’ Medici.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Luynes’s death on the 15th of December 1621 made possible a reconciliation a month later between the king and his mother.&nbsp;Although Louis still distrusted her at heart, and disliked her&nbsp;dominating minister more, he allowed her to take up her&nbsp;residence in the Luxembourg palace in Paris, thus rendering&nbsp;intercourse possible. Richelieu seized his opportunity. He&nbsp;furnished Marie de’ Medici with political ideas and acute&nbsp;criticisms of the king’s ministry, especially of the Brularts.&nbsp;Marie zealously pushed her favourite towards office, and had&nbsp;gone so far as to absent herself from court for three months on&nbsp;account of the king’s persistent refusal, when Charles, duc de&nbsp;La Vieuville, then head of the council, in need of her aid in his&nbsp;negotiations with reference to the marriage of her daughter&nbsp;Henriette Marie, finally agreed to force Richelieu’s appointment&nbsp;to office upon the king, Louis XIII. La Vieuville thought to&nbsp;compromise by forcing the cardinal into a “ council of despatches,” with merely the privilege of advising the king’s&nbsp;council but entrusted with no power. Richelieu raised many&nbsp;objections to such a partial realization of his ambition, but the&nbsp;king ended them in April 1624 by naming him as a member of&nbsp;his council. By August Vieuville’s worst fears were realized;&nbsp;he was arrested on the 13th of the month for corrupt practices in&nbsp;office, and the intriguing cardinal who had caused his overthrow&nbsp;became chief minister of Louis XIII. His advent was hailed&nbsp;with joy by both the Catholic party and the patriotic party,&nbsp;eager for the overthrow of Habsburg supremacy in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the next eighteen years the biography of Richelieu is the history of France, and to a large degree that of Europe. His&nbsp;work was directed toward a twofold aim: to make the royal&nbsp;power—his power—absolute and supreme at home, and to crush&nbsp;the rival European power of the Habsburgs. At home there&nbsp;were two opponents to be dealt with: the Huguenots and the&nbsp;feudal nobility. The former were crushed by the siege of La&nbsp;Rochelle and the vigorous campaign against the duc de Rohan.&nbsp;But the religious toleration of the edict of Nantes was reaffirmed&nbsp;while its political privileges were destroyed, and Huguenot&nbsp;officers fought loyally in the foreign enterprises of the cardinal.&nbsp;The suppression of the independence of the feudal aristocracy&nbsp;was inaugurated in 1626 by an edict calling for the destruction&nbsp;of all fortified castles not needed for defence against invasion.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
