<p><span class="font2">been covered with t</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2">ιe pools belonging to the “ golden house of Nero.” Owing to the stability of its construction, it survived the era of barbarism, and was so perfect in&nbsp;the thirteenth century, that games were celebrated in it&nbsp;for the amusement of all the nobility of Italy. Its destruction was, in a great measure, the work of the Romans themselves, who carried off the materials to build their own&nbsp;dwellings.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">till at length Benedict XIV. secured it from further dilapidation, by erecting a cross in the middle of the arena, and proclaiming it to be consecrated ground, hallowed by&nbsp;the blood of the martyrs. The form of the Coliseum is&nbsp;elliptical ; the length measures 591¼ feet, and the breadth&nbsp;508¾ ; it is 1683¾ feet in circumference, and 147 in height.&nbsp;The exterior elevation presents four divisions or storeys, of&nbsp;which the three lower are supported by half columns, and&nbsp;the uppermost by pilasters. The interior elevation, beginning from the arena, presented first the podium, a kind of&nbsp;covered gallery, destined for the use of the emperor and&nbsp;persons of the first description ; then three successive orders of seats for the spectators, called collectively the cavea;&nbsp;and at the top the attic, with the velarium or awning. It&nbsp;has been calculated that the cavea, with the podium, could&nbsp;contain 80,000 persons seated ; but taking into account the&nbsp;upper gallery, and the number of persons necessarily engaged about the arena, that not less than 100,000 souls&nbsp;have sometimes been contained within these walls. At the&nbsp;dedication, which lasted one hundred days, 5000 wild beasts&nbsp;were exhibited and slain.@@<sup>1</sup> The arena also was overflowed&nbsp;with water, and made the scene of a mock naval fight. The&nbsp;northern side is pretty entire ; but on the south, the stupendous arches have been stripped of their external decorations. In the interior the destruction is more complete ;&nbsp;the marble steps are all torn away, the steps and vomitories&nbsp;overthrown, and the sloping walls and broken arches are&nbsp;covered with weeds and shrubs. Around the arena the&nbsp;pictured representations of the fourteen stages of our Lord’s&nbsp;passion are placed at regular intervals. In the centre of&nbsp;it stands a huge black cross, which offers the liberal recompense of one hundred days’ indulgence to every person who&nbsp;devoutly kisses it. A broad pathway runs through the middle ; the rest is covered with a smooth green sod. “ Here,”&nbsp;says Mr. Forsyth, “ sat the conquerors of the world, coolly&nbsp;to enjoy the tortures and death of men who had never&nbsp;offended them. Two aqueducts were scarcely sufficient to&nbsp;wash off the human blood which a few hours’ sport shed in&nbsp;this imperial shambles. Twice in one day came the senators and matrons of Rome to the butchery. A virgin always gave thc signal for slaughter; and when glutted with&nbsp;bloodshed, those ladies sat down in the wet and steaming&nbsp;arena to a luxurious supper. Such reflections check our&nbsp;regret for its ruin. As it now stands, the Coliseum is a&nbsp;striking image of Rome itself, decayed, vacant, serious, yet&nbsp;grand, half grey and half green, erect on one side and fallen&nbsp;on the other, with consecrated ground in its bosom ; inhabited by a beadsman, visited by every cast; for moralists,&nbsp;antiquaries, painters, architects, devotees, all meet here to&nbsp;meditate, to examine, to draw, to measure, and to pray.”@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Between the Aventine and Palatine hills stood the Circus Maximus, which occupied the whole valley; and though all traces of the building have disappeared, its form is still&nbsp;very apparent. This circus was first laid out by Tarquinius&nbsp;Priscus ;@@<sup>3</sup> but it does not appear to have attained any great&nbsp;degree of splendour till the time of Julius Cæsar, who enlarged the whole space, and rendered it capable of containing 150,000 spectators. Pliny states that in the time of&nbsp;Trajan it held 250,000.@@<sup>4</sup> It was the last place where games&nbsp;were celebrated in Rome. So late as the close of the fifth&nbsp;century, it was filled for the last time with spectators of the&nbsp;gladiatorial combats, when Telemachus, an Asiatic monk,&nbsp;having ineffectually tried remonstrance, descended into the&nbsp;arena to separate the combatants, and was stoned to death&nbsp;by the enraged people. But the sacrifice was not made in&nbsp;vain, for from that day Honorius abolished the combats of&nbsp;gladiators. The last remains of tlle Circus Maximus were&nbsp;removed by Paul III., “ that universal destroyer of antiquities.” Attached to this circus were the shops or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tabernœ,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">in which, during the reign of Nero, began the conflagration&nbsp;that consumed ten out of fourteen quarters of the city. Of&nbsp;all tlle circuses of ancient Rome, one only is sufficiently&nbsp;entire to shew what a circus was. It stands on the Via&nbsp;Appia, beside the tomb of Cecilia Metella, and is called the&nbsp;circus of Caracalla, though there is no reason for believing&nbsp;it to have been built by tllat emperor. It is still in excellent preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the outside of the Coliseum are the mouldering ruins of a building, supposed to have been that famous fountain&nbsp;the Meta Sudans, which existed even in the time of the&nbsp;republic.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the most attractive of the ancient edifices of Rome, is the Pantheon or Rotondo, “ the pride of Rome.”&nbsp;That glorious combination of beauty and magnificence,&nbsp;which was erected by Agrippa, is 132 feet in height, the&nbsp;same in diameter, and 396 feet in circumference. It is&nbsp;generally believed that the body of the building is of earlier erection than the portico ; that it was built for a thermal hall, or something belonging to the baths of Agrippa,&nbsp;and that the portico was afterwards added in order to convert it into a temple. It has long been a matter of dispute&nbsp;to whom the Pantheon was dedicated. The popular belief&nbsp;is, that it was dedicated to Jupiter and all the gods of antiquity ; but Pliny expressly says that it was dedicated to&nbsp;Jupiter the Avenger.@@<sup>6</sup> In the year 608, Pope Boniface&nbsp;IV. obtained permission of the emperor Phocas to consecrate it for a Christian church. It then received the title&nbsp;of St. Maria Rotondo, which it still preserves. About fifty&nbsp;years after its consecration, Constans II. stripped off the&nbsp;bronze covering of the roof, the bronze bassi relievi of the&nbsp;pediment, and tlle silver which adorned the interior of the&nbsp;dome, and carried away the spoil to send it to Constantinople ; but being murdered at Syracuse on his return, these&nbsp;ornaments were afterwards conveyed by tlle Saracens to&nbsp;Alexandria. In 1632, Pope Urban VIII., one of the Bar-berini family, carried off all the bronze that was left, and&nbsp;moulded it into ornaments for St. Peter’s tomb in the&nbsp;Vatican, and cannon for the castle of St. Angelo. It has&nbsp;been calculated that upwards of forty· five millions of pounds&nbsp;weight of metal was taken away on that occasion. This&nbsp;gave rise to the pasquinade, “ Quod non fecerunt Barbari&nbsp;Romæ, fecerunt Barberini.” The same pope disfigured the&nbsp;building by placing before the dome two hideous belfries,&nbsp;as a perpetual monument of his wretched taste. As a sort&nbsp;of compensation, however, he replaced one of the three&nbsp;deficient columns of the portico. The other two were&nbsp;restored by Pope Alexander VII. The portal has been&nbsp;pronounced to be “ positively the most sublime result that&nbsp;was ever produced by so little architecture.” The original&nbsp;folding doors are said to have been carried off by Genseric ;&nbsp;but the present gates are obviously ancient also, and are&nbsp;supposed to have been taken from some other Roman&nbsp;building.
