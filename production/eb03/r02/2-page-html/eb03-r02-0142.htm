<p><span class="font0">Campanians. The Samnites were the braveſt men the Romans had ever yet encountered, and the contention&nbsp;between the two nations was managed on both ſides&nbsp;with the moſt determined reſolution. But the fortune&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">Rome prevailed; the Samnites at length fled, averring, that they were not able to withſtand the fierce&nbsp;looks and the fire-darting eyes of the Romans. The&nbsp;other conſul, however, was not at firſt ſo fortunate;&nbsp;for having unwarily led his army into a defile, he was&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font0">danger of being cut off, had not Decius, a tribune&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font0">the army, poſſeſſed himſelf of an hill which commanded the enemy: ſo that the Samnites, being attacked on either ſide, were defeated with great ſlaughter, no leſs than 30, 000 of them being left dead upon&nbsp;the field of battle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some time after this victory, the ſoldiers who were ſtationed at Capua mutinying, forced Quintius, an old&nbsp;and eminent ſoldier, who was then reſiding in the country, to be their leader ; and, conducted by their rage&nbsp;more than their general, came within eight miles of&nbsp;the city. So terrible an enemy, almoſt at the gates,&nbsp;not a little alarmed the ſenate ; who immediately created&nbsp;Valerius Corvus dictator, and ſent him forth with another army to oppoſe them. The two armies were now&nbsp;drawn up againſt each other, while fathers and ſons beheld themſelves prepared to engage in oppoſite cauſes ;&nbsp;but Corvus, knowing his influence among the ſoldiery,&nbsp;inſtead of going forward to meet the mutineers in an&nbsp;hoſtile manner, went with the moſt cordial friendſhip&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font0">embrace and expoſtulate with his old acquaintances.&nbsp;His conduct had the deſired effect. Quintius, as their&nbsp;ſpeaker, only deſired to have their défection from their&nbsp;duty forgiven ; and as for himſelf, as he was innocent&nbsp;of their conſpiracy, he had no reaſon to ſolicit pardon&nbsp;for his offences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A war between the Romans and the Latins followed ſoon after ; but as their habits, arms, and language,&nbsp;were the ſame, the moſt exact diſcipline was neceſſary&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font0">prevent confuſion in the engagement. Orders,&nbsp;therefore, were iſſued by Manlius the conſul, that no&nbsp;ſoldier ſhould leave his ranks upon whatever provocation ; and that he ſhould be certainly put to death who&nbsp;ſhould offer do do otherwiſe. With theſe injunctions,&nbsp;both armies were drawn out in array, and ready to begin ; when Metius, the general of the enemy’s cavalry,&nbsp;puſhed forward from his lines, and challenged any&nbsp;knight in the Roman army to ſingle combat. For ferne&nbsp;time there was a general pauſe, no ſoldier offering to&nbsp;diſobey his orders, till Titus Manlius, the conſul’s own&nbsp;ſon, burning with ſhame to ſee the whole body of the&nbsp;Romans intimidated, boldly iallied out againſt his adverſary. The ſoldiers on both ſides for a while ſuſpended the general engagement to be ſpectators of this&nbsp;fierce encounter. Manlius killed his adverſary ; and&nbsp;then deſpoiling him of his armour, returned in triumph&nbsp;to his father’s tent, where he was preparing and giving&nbsp;orders relative to the engagement. Howſoever he&nbsp;might have been applauded by his fellow-ſoldiers, being&nbsp;as yet doubtful of the reception he ſhould find from his&nbsp;father, he came, with heſitation, to lay the enemy’s&nbsp;ſpoils at his feet, and with a modeſt air inſinuated, that&nbsp;what he did was entirely from a ſpirit of hereditary virtue. But he was ſoon dreadfully made ſenſible of his&nbsp;error, when his father, turning away, ordered him to&nbsp;be led publicly forth before the army, and there to</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">have his head ſtruck off on account of his diſobeying orders. The whole army was ſtruck with horror at&nbsp;this unnatural mandate : fear for a while kept them in&nbsp;ſuſpenſe ; but when they ſaw their young champion’s&nbsp;head ſtruck off, and his blood ſtreaming upon the&nbsp;ground, they could no longer contain their execrations '&nbsp;and their groans. His dead body was carried forth&nbsp;without the camp, and being ‘adorned with the ſpoils of&nbsp;the vanquiſhed enemy, was buried with all the pomp of&nbsp;military diſtreſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, the battle joined with mutual fury ; and as the two armies had oſten fought under&nbsp;the ſame leaders, they combated with all the animo-ſity of a civil war. The Latins chiefly depended on&nbsp;their bodily ſtrength ; the Romans, on their invincible&nbsp;courage and conduct. Forces ſo nearly matched ſeemed only to require the protection of their deities to turn&nbsp;the ſcale of victory ; and, in fact, the augurs had foretold, that whatever part of the Roman army ſhould be&nbsp;diſtreſſed, the commander of that part ſhould devote&nbsp;himſelf for his country, and die as a ſacriſice to the&nbsp;immortal gods. Manlius commanded the right wing,&nbsp;and Decius led on the left. Both ſides fought for ſome&nbsp;time with doubtful ſucceſs, as their courage was equal ;&nbsp;but, after a time, the leſt wing of the Roman army&nbsp;began to give ground. It was then that Decius, who&nbsp;commanded there, reſolved to devote himſelf for his&nbsp;country, and to offer his own life as an atonement to&nbsp;ſave his army. Thus determined, he called out to&nbsp;Manlius With a loud voice, and demanded his inſtructions, as he was the chief pontiff, how to devote himſelf, and the form of the words he ſhould uſe. By his&nbsp;directions, therefore, being clothed in a long robe, his&nbsp;head covered, and his arms ſtretched forward, ſtanding&nbsp;upon a javelin, he devoted himſelf to the celeſtial and&nbsp;infernal gods for the ſafety of Rome. Then arming&nbsp;himſelf, and mounting on horſeback, he drove furiouſly into the midſt of the enemy, carrying terror and&nbsp;conſternation wherever he came, till he ſell covered with&nbsp;wounds. In the mean time, the Roman army conſidered his devoting himſelf in this manner as an aſſurance&nbsp;of ſucceſs ; nor was the ſuperſtition of the Latins leſs&nbsp;powerfully influenced by his reſolution ; a total rout&nbsp;began to enſue : the Romans preſſed them on every&nbsp;ſide ; and ſo great was the carnage, that ſcarce a fourth&nbsp;part of the enemy ſurvived the defeat. This was the laſt&nbsp;battle of any conſequence that the Latins had with the&nbsp;Romans : they were forced to beg a peace upon hard&nbsp;conditions ; and two years after, their ſtrongeſt city,&nbsp;Pædum, being taken, they were brought under an entire&nbsp;ſubmiſſion to the Roman power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A ſignal diſgrace which the Romans ſuſtained about this time in their conteſt with the Samnites, made a&nbsp;pauſe in their uſual good fortune, and turned the ſcale&nbsp;for a while in the enemy’s favour. The ſenate having&nbsp;denied the Samnites peace, Pontius their general was&nbsp;reſolved to gain by ſtratagem what he had frequently&nbsp;loſt by force. Accordingly, leading his army into a&nbsp;defile called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Claudium,</span><span class="font0"> and taking poſſeſſion of all its&nbsp;outlets, he ſent 10 of his ſoldiers, habited like ſhepherds,&nbsp;with directions to throw themſelves in the way the Romans were to march. The Roman conſul met them,&nbsp;and taking them for what the) appeared, demanded the&nbsp;route the Samnite army had taken ; they,, with ſeeming&nbsp;indifference, replied, that they were gone to Luceria, a</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
