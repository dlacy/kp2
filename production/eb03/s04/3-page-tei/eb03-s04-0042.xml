Mr Magellan informs us, that its calx, precipitated by volatile alkali, gives a yellow colour to glaſs, and that he has ſeen it ſtained in this manner ſo high as almoſt to appear of a red colour. It unites with moſt metals, even with iron. The nature of this alloy has been but little inquired into, though Fourcroy is of opinion that it may probably be of the greateſt utility in the arts. It combines in all proportions with copper, by which it is not deprived of its ductility, but renders it harder and more ſonorous; by which means it is often uſed in bells. It is otherwiſe highly uſeful, on account of its indeſtructibility by fire and air, and its extreme ductility. Its fine colour renders it extremely proper for ornamental purpoſes, and it is applied like gold on the ſurface of different bodies, and even on copper. It likewiſe enters the texture of rich ſilks ; but its moſt conſiderable use is that of being employed as money of an inferior value to gold. In this case, it is alloyed with one-twelfth part of copper. It is likewiſe often employed in making houſehold utenſils of all kinds, though its great price renders it leſs common than it would otherwiſe be for this purpoſe. For plate, it is uſually alloyed with one twenty-fourth of copper, which gives it a greater degree of hardneſs and coherence, without rendering it in the leaſt noxious.</p><p>Silver has alſo been uſed in medicine : but its extreme cauſticity, when diſſolved in the nitrous acid, and its inactivity otherwiſe, have brought it into difuſe. The cryſtals of ſilver have been recommended in very ſmall quantity in dropſical caſes; but they are by no means ſuperior, or even equal in efficacy, to much ſafer medicines.

Cleanſe the metal with aquafortis, by waſhing it lightly, and immediately throwing it into pure water ; or by heating it red-hot, and ſcouring it with ſalt and tartar and pure water with a ſmall wire bruſh. 2. Dissolve ſome ſilver in aquafortis, in a broad-bottomed glaſs veſſel, or of glazed earth ; then evaporate away the aquafortis over a chaffing diſh of coals. 3. Put five or six times its quantity of water, or as much as will be neceſſary to disſolve it perfectly, on the remaining dry calx ; evaporate this water with the like heat ; then put more freſh water, and evaporate again ; and, if need be, the third time, making the fire towards the latter end ſo ſtrong as to leave the calx perfectly dry, which, if your ſilver is good, will be of a pure white. 4. Take of this calx, common ſalt, cryſtal of tartar, of each a like quantity or bulk, and mixing well the whole compoſition, put the metal into pure water, and take of the ſaid powder with your wet fingers, and rub it well on, till you find every little cavity of the metal ſufficiently silvered over. 5.

The head is naked ; the mouth let round with hairy filaments ; the bronchiæ have from 4 to 14 rays ; the ray of the pectoral fins, or the firſt dorſal one, is prickly, and dentated backwards-— There are 21 ſpecies, moſt of them natives of the Indian and American ſeas. Mr Haſſelquiſt mentions one called the <hi rend="italic">clarias</hi> by Linnæus, and <hi rend="italic">ſcheilan</hi> by the Arabians.

From theſe he compoſed a hiſtory of the kings of England, from A. D. 616 to 1130; with ſome ſmaller hiſtorical pieces. Simeon both ſtudied and taught the ſciences, and particularly the mathematics at Oxford ; and became precentor of the church at Durham, where he died, probably ſoon after the concluſion of his hiſtory, which was continued by John, prior of Hexham, to A. D. 1156.</p><p>SIMIA, the <hi rend="smallcaps">Monkey,</hi> a genus of quadrupeds belonging to the claſs of mammalia, and order of primates, in the Linnæan ſyſtem, but by Mr Pennant arranged under the digitated quadrupeds. According to the Linnæan ſyſtem, the characteriſtics of this genus are theſe : There are four cloſe ſet fore-teeth on each jaw ; ſingle tuſks on each ſide in both jaws, which are longer than the reſt, and ſomewhat remote from them. The grinders are obtuſe, and the feet are formed like hands. Mr Pennant gives the following generic deſcription of the fimia. There are four cutting teeth in each jaw, and two canine. Each of the feet are formed like hands, generally with flat nails, and, except in one inſtance, have four fingers and a thumb. There are eyebrows both above and below. </p><p>They are a numerous race ; but almoſt all confined to the torrid zone. They fill the woods of Africa from Senegal to the Cape, and from thence to Æthiopia. They are found in all parts of India, and its iſlands ; in Cochin-China, in the ſouth of China, and in Japan ; (and one is met with in Arabia) ; and they ſwarm in the foreſts of South America, from the isthmus of Darien as far as Paraguay. They are lively, agile, full of frolic, chatter, and grimace. From the ſtructure of their members, they have many actions in common with the human kind. Moſt of them are fierce and untameable ; ſome are of a milder nature, and will ſhow a degree of attachment ; but in general they are endowed with miſchievous intellects ; and are filthy, obſcene, laſcivious, and thieving. They inhabit the woods, and live on trees ; feeding on fruits, leaves, and insects. In general, they are gregarious, going in vaſt companies ; but the different ſpecies never mix with each other, always keeping apart and in different quarters. They leap with vaſt activity from tree to tree, even</p></body></text></TEI>
