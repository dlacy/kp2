in zoology. See Mus.</p><p>The following receipt is ſaid to have been found ef-• fectual for the deſtruction of rats. Take of the feeds of ſtavefacre or loufewort, powdered, more or leſs as the occaſion requires, one part ; of oat-meal, three parts ; mix them well, and make them up into a paſte with honey. Lay pieces of ſt in the holes, and on the places where mice and rats frequent ; and it will effectually kill or rid the place of thoſe kind of vermin by their eating thereof.</p><p>Some time ago, the ſociety for encouraging arts pro-pofed a premium of 50l. for a preparation capable of alluring or faſcinating rats ſo that they might be taken ahve. In conſequence of this, a great number of new’ traps, &amp;c. were invented ; and the following methods of alluring the rats to a certain place were publiſhed.</p><p>Θne of thoſe moſt eaſily and efficaciouſly practiſed is the trailing ſome pieces of their moſt favourite food, which ſhould be of the kind that has the ſtrongeſt ſcent, ſuch as toaſted cheeſe or broiled red herrings, from the holes or entrances of the cloſet to their receſſes in every part of the houſe or contiguous building. At the extremities and in different parts of the courfe of this trailed track, ſmall quantities oſ meal, or any other kind, of their food, ſhould be laid, to bring the greater number into the tracks, and to encourage them to purſue it to the place where they are intended to be taken : at that place, when time admits oſ it, a more plentiful repail is laid for them, and the trailing repeated for two or three nights.</p><p>Beſides this trailing and way-baiting, fome of the moſt expert of the rat-catchers have a ſhorter and per-haps more effectual method of bringing them together; which is the calling them, by making ſuch a whiffling node as reſembles their own call ; and by this means, with the aſſiſtance of the way-baits, they call them out of their holes, and lead them to the repaſt prepared for them at the place deſigned for taking them. But this is much more difficult to be practiſed than the art of trailing ; for the learning the exact notes or cries of any kind oſ beaſts or birds, fo as to deceive them, is a peculiar talent which is ſeldom attained : though fome perfons have been known who could call tog-ether a great number of cats ; and there was a man in London who.could bring nightingales, when they were within hearing, about him, and even allure them to perch on his hand, lo as to be taken.</p><p>In practiſing either of thoſe methods, of trailing or calling, great caution muſt be uled by the operator to ſupprefs and prevent the fcent of his feet and body from being perceived ; which is done by overpowering that ſcent by others of a ſtronger nature. In order to this, the feet are to be covered with cloths rubbed over with afafiaetida, or other ſtrong-ſmelling fubſtances ; and even oil of rhodium is fometimes uſed for this purpoſe, but ſparingly, on account of fits dearneſs, .though it has a very alluring as well as diſguiling effect. If this caution of avoiding the ſcent of the operator’s feet, near the tιack, and in the place where the rats are propoſed to be collected, be not properly obſerved, it will very much obſtruct the ſucceſs of the attempt to take them ; for they are very ſhy of coming where the ſcent of human feet lies very freſh, as it intimates to their ſagaci-υus inſtinct the preſence of human creatures, whom they</p>

<p>naturally dread. To the above-mentioned means oſ aI-luring by trailing, way-baiting, and calling, is added another of a very material efficacy, which is, the uſe of oil of rhodium, which, like the marum Syriacum in the caſe of cats, has a very extraordinary faſcinating power on theſe animals. This oil is extremely dear, and therefore ſparingly uſed. It is exalted in a ſmall quantity in the place, and at the entrance of it, where the rats are intended to be taken ; particularly at the time when tlicy are to be laſt brought together, in order to their deſtruction ; and it is uſed alfi&gt; by fτnearing it on the ſurface of ſome of the implements uſed in taking by the method below deſcribed ; and the effect it has in taking off their caution and dread, by the delight they appear to have in it, is very extraordinary.</p><p>It is uſual, likewife, for tlie operator to diſguiſe his figure as well as ſcent, which is done by putting on a fort of gown or cloak, of one colour, that hides the natural form, and makes him appear like a poſt or fome ſuch inanimate thing ; which habit muſt likewiſe be ſcented as above, to overpower the ſmell of his perſon and beſides this, he is to avoid all motion till he has ſe-cured his point of having all the rats in his power.</p><p>when the rats are thus enticed and collected, where time is afforded, and the whole in any houſe and outbuildings are intended to be cleared away, they are ſuffered to regale on what they moſt like, which is ready prepared for them, and then to go away quietly for two or three nights ; by which means thoſe that are not allured the firſt night are brought afterwards, either by their fellows, or the effects of the trailing, &amp;c. and will not fail to come duly again, if they are not diſturbed or moleſted. But many of the rat-catchers make ſhort -er work, and content themſelves with what can be brought together in one night or two ; but this is never effectual, unleſs· where the building is ſmall and en-tire, and the rats but few in number..</p><p>The means of taking them, when they are brought together, are various. Some entice them into a very large bag, the mouth of which- is ſufficiently capacious to cover nearly the whole floor of the place where they are collected ; which is done by fmearing fome veffel, placed in the middle of the bag, with oil of rhodium, and laying in the bag baits of food. This bag, which before lay ſtat on the ground with the mouth ſpread open, is to be fuddenly cloſed when, the rats are all in.. Others drive or fright them, by ſtight noiſes or motions, into a bag of a long form, the mouth of which, after all the rats, are come in, is drawn up to the opening of the place by whieh they entered, all other ways of retreat being ſeeured. others, again, intoxicate or poiſon them, by mixing with the repaſt prepared for them the cocu-Ius Indicus, or the nux vomica. They direct four oun-ces of the coculus Indieus, with twelve ounces of oatmeal, and two ounces of treacle or honey, made into a moiſt paſte with ſtrong-beer : but if the nux vomica be uſed, a much leſs proportion will ſerve than, is here given of the coculus. Any ſimilar compoſition of theſe drugs, with that kind of food the rats are moſt fond of, and which has a ſtrong flavour, to hide that of tlie drugs, will equally well anſwer the end. If indeed the coculus Indicus be well p⅛wdered, and infuſed in ſtrong-beer for ſome time, at leaſt half the quantity here directed will ſerve as well as the quantity before-men-tioned. when the rats appear to be thoroughly in</p><p>toxicated with the coculus, or ſick with the nux vomica, they may be taken with the hand, and put into a bag or cage, the door of the place being firſt drawn to, leſt thoſe who have ſtrength and ſenſe remaining eſcape.</p><p><hi rend="italic">RAT-Iſland,</hi> a ſmall detached part of the iſland of Lundy, off the north coaſt of Devon. ’ Though noted in Donn’s map of the county, it is not worth mention here, but as giving opportunity to ſubjoin a farther notice of Lundy, which iſland was purchaſed a few years ſince by Mr Cleveland Μ. P. for about 1200 guineas# who has a ſmall villa on it : not more than 400 acres are cultivated : it is let altogether for 70h a-year. The foil is good, though no trees will grow on the iſland.' It has fine ſprings of water : the houſes are ſeven : the inhabitants, men, women, and children, do not exceed 24. The bird called <hi rend="italic">murr,</hi> whoſe eggs are very large-and fine, the Lundy parrot, and rabbits, are the chief produce ; theſe abound, and are taken for the feathers,-eggs, and ſkins, principally. They have now (1794) 70 bullocks and 400 ſheep, but the latter do not thrive.' They pay no taxes : fiſhing ſkiffs often call with neceſſaries : the ſituation is very pleaſant, and the rocks: around, which are large, and partly granite, are wild,, romantic, and novel. It had probably more inhabitants once, as human bones have been ploughed up. It has no place of worſhip, nor public-houſe; but ſtrangers are always welcome. Eight cannon lie on the battlements on the top of a very ſteep precipice, under which· is a curious cavern. Lord Gower, Mr Benfon, and Sir J. B. warren, K. B. have been former proprietors.
