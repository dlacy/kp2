<p><span class="font3">Zinc in sheets is a material largely used as a roof covering, and if care be taken to ensure metal of good quality, it proves itself light,&nbsp;strong and durable, as well as inexpensive. Zinc is&nbsp;stronger weight for weight than lead, slate, tile and glass,&nbsp;but weaker than copper, wrought-iron and steel, although with the&nbsp;exception of the two last mentioned it is not so durable when</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">exposed to the weather. It is not liable to easy breakage as are&nbsp;slate, tile and glass. It is usually&nbsp;supplied in flat sheets, although&nbsp;it can also be had in the corrugated form similar to corrugated sheet-iron. When exposed,&nbsp;a thin coating of oxide is&nbsp;formed on the surface which</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">protects the metal beneath from any further change, and obviates the necessity of painting. In laying the sheets, the use of solder&nbsp;and nails, should be avoided entirely except for fixing clips and&nbsp;tacks which do not interfere with the free expansion and contraction of the sheets. The reason for this is that zinc expands&nbsp;freely, and sheets laid with soldered seams </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">or</span><span class="font3"> fixed with nails are&nbsp;liable to buckle and probably break away owing to movements set&nbsp;up by changes of temperature. The usual sizes of zinc sheets are&nbsp;7 ft. or 8 ft. long by 3 ft. wide. The thickness and weights of zinc&nbsp;are shown in the following table, which compares the Vieille Mon-tagne Gauge with the Old Belgian Gauge and the British Imperial&nbsp;Standard Wire Gauge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The best method of laying a zinc flat roof is with the aid of wood &quot; rolls ” of about 2 in. X2 in. in section, splayed at sides and spaced&nbsp;2 ft. 8 in. apart and fixed to the roof boarding with zinc nails. Iron&nbsp;nails should not be used as this metal affects, the zinc. The sheets&nbsp;of zinc are laid between the rolls with their sides bent up ii in. or&nbsp;2 in. against them, and held firmly in position by clips of zinc&nbsp;attached to the rolls. A cap of the same metal is then slipped over&nbsp;each roll and fastened down by tacks about 3 in. long soldered inside&nbsp;’ it </span><span class="font2">so </span><span class="font3">as to hook under the same clips that hold the sheet down.&nbsp;Drips of about 2$ in. are made in the slope at intervals of 6 ft. or&nbsp;7 ft.—that is, the length of a sheet—and special care must be taken at&nbsp;these points to keep the work waterproof. The lower sheet is bent&nbsp;up the face of the drip and under the projecting portion of the upper&nbsp;sheet, which is finished with a roll edge to turn off the water. The&nbsp;end of the roll has a specially folded cap which also finishes with a&nbsp;curved or beaded water check, and this in conjunction with the&nbsp;saddle piece of the roll beneath forms a weather-proof joint (figs. 17&nbsp;and 18). The fall between the drips is usually made about 1 j in.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">but where necessary it may be less, the least permissible fall being about 1 in 80. Felt laid beneath zinc has the effect of lengthening</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">the life of the roof and should always be used, as the edges of the boarding upon which it is laid are, when the latter warps, apt to cut&nbsp;the sheets. It also forms a cushion protecting the zinc if there is&nbsp;traffic across the roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Sheet-lead forms a much heavier roof covering than zinc, but it lasts a great deal longer and more easily withstands the attacks of&nbsp;impure air. Lead must be laid on a close boarding, for&nbsp;its great ductility prevents it from spanning even the&nbsp;smallest spaces without bending and giving way,. This characteristic of the metal, however, conduces largely to its usefulness, and&nbsp;enables it to be dressed and bossed into awkward corners without&nbsp;the necessity of jointing. The coefficient of expansion for lead&nbsp;is nearly as great as that for zinc and much higher than in the&nbsp;case of iron, and this fact requires precautions similar to those&nbsp;affecting zinc to be taken when laying the roofing. The manner of&nbsp;laying is with rolls and drips as in the case of zinc, the details of the&nbsp;work differing somewhat to suit the character of the material&nbsp;(see figs. 19, 20 and 2l), Allowances must be made for expansion</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">and contraction, and the use of nails and solder avoided as far as possible. Contact with iron sets up corrosion in lead, and when&nbsp;nails are necessary they should be of copper; Screws should be of&nbsp;brass. Lead is supplied in rolls of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">25 to 35 ft.</span><span class="font3"> long and 6 ft. to 7 ft.&nbsp;6 in. wide. That in general use varies from one-fourteenth to one-seventh of an inch in thickness. The weights most suitable for&nbsp;employment in roofing work are ,7 or 8 lb per square foot for flats&nbsp;and gutters, 6 lb for ndges and hips, and 5 lb for flashings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">As a roof covering copper is lighter, stronger and more durable than either zinc or lead. It expands and contracts much less than&nbsp;these metals, and although not so strong as wrought-iron&nbsp;and steel it is much more durable. From a structural&nbsp;point of view these qualities enable it to be classed as the best&nbsp;available metal for roof covering, although its heat-conducting&nbsp;properties require it to be well- insulated by layers of felt and other&nbsp;non-conducting material placed beneath the metal. On exposure&nbsp;to the air copper develops a feature of great beauty in the coating&nbsp;of green carbonate which forms upon its surface protecting it from&nbsp;further decomposition. Perhaps the chief disadvantage in the use&nbsp;of copper lies in its first cost, but against this must be set the almost&nbsp;imperishable nature of the metal and the fact that by reason of its&nbsp;light weight less substantial framework is required for its support.&nbsp;Copper roofing should be laid in a similar manner to zinc, with wood&nbsp;rolls at intervals of about 2 ft. 4 in. It is, however, often laid with&nbsp;welted seams. The general stock sizes of sheets are from 4 ft. to&nbsp;5 ft. 3 in. long and 2 ft. to 3 ft. 6 in. wide. The thickness almost&nbsp;invariably used is known as 24 S.W.G. and weighs 16 oz. per square&nbsp;foot. Thinner metal would suffice, but owing to the increased cost&nbsp;of rolling very little would be gained by adopting the thinner&nbsp;gauges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the United States of America “ tin ” roofs are quite commonly used. Sheets of wrought-iron coated either,with tin or zinc are&nbsp;used of a size usually 14 in. by 20 in., though they may&nbsp;be had double this size. Preparation for laying is made&nbsp;by fixing an insulating foundation of somewhat stout paper&nbsp;or felt; this must be dry, else it is apt to spoil tne impermeable&nbsp;covering laid upon it by causing it to rust. Junctions between&nbsp;the sheets are made by welted seams in which the four edges of the&nbsp;sheets are turned over so as to lock together, thus forming one large&nbsp;sheet of tin covering the roof. In high-class work of a permanent&nbsp;nature the seams in addition are soldered, rosin only being used as a&nbsp;flux. Each sheet also is secured to the roof with two or three tin&nbsp;cleats. The life of such roofs may be practically doubled by the&nbsp;application of a good coat of paint, which, however, adds considerably to the cost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Slate is a strong and veiy impermeable material, and these</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">?</span><span class="font3">|ualities and the fact that it is easily split into thin plates suitable or laying, as well as its low cost, cause it to be by far.the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">slate,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">most generally used of all materials for roof covering..</span></p>
