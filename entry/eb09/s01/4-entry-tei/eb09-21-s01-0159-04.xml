Besides working a considerable number of coal-mines, St diamond employs twelve mills in the silk manufacture, and from 12,000 to 15,000 looms (mostly driven by hydraulic machinery) in lace-making, and has a variety of other manufactures. The population was 14,149 in 1881.</p><p>St diamond, founded in the 7th century by St Ennemond or diamond, archbishop of Lyons, became the chief town of the Jarret, a little principality formed by the valley of the Gier. Silk-milling was introduced in the town in the middle of the 16th century by Gayotti, a native of Bologna, and perfected towards the beginning of the 19th by Richard Chambovet. Remains are found at St diamond of a Roman aqueduct, which conveyed the waters of the Janon along the valley of the Gier to Lyons.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
