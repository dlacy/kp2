In 1801 Rose left office with Pitt, but returned 'with him to power in 1804, when he was made vice-president of the committee on trade and joint paymaster-general. He resigned these offices a few days after Pitt’s death in 1806, but he served as vice-president of the committee on trade and treasurer of the navy under the duke of Portland and Spencer Perceval from 1807 to 1812. He was again treasurer of the navy under Lord Liverpool, and he was still member of parliament for Christchurch, a seat which he had held since 1790, when he died at Cuffnells, in Hampshire, on the 13th of January 1818. Rose was an able and conscientious public servant, although he and his two sons drew a large amount of money from sinecures, a fact referred to by William Cobbett in his “ A New Year’s Gift to old George Rose.” He wrote several books on economic subjects, and his <hi rend="italic">Diaries and Correspondence,</hi>  edited by the Rev. L. V. Harcourt, was published in i860.</p><p>His elder son, Sir George Henry Rose (1771-1855), was in parliament from 1794 to 1813, and again from 1818 to 1844, and in the meantime he was British minister at Munich and at Berlin; in 1818 he succeeded his father as clerk of the parliaments. He was the father of Baron Strathnairn (9.V.). The second son was the poet William Stewart Rose (?.v.).</p><p>ROSE, HUGH JAMES (1795-1838), English divine, was born at Little Horsted in Sussex on the 9th of June 1795, and was educated at Uckfield school and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated B.A. in 1817, but missed a fellowship. Taking orders, he was appointed to Buxted, Sussex, in 1819, and to the vicarage of Horsham in 1821. He had already attained some repute as a critic, which was enhanced when, after travelling in Germany, he delivered as select preacher at Cambridge, four addresses against rationalism, published in 1825 as <hi rend="italic">The State of the Protestant Religion in Germany.</hi>  The book was severely criticized in Germany, and in England by E. B. Pusey. In 1827 Rose was collated to the prebend of Middleton; in 1830 he accepted the rectory of Hadleigh, Suffolk, and in 1833 that of Fairsted, Essex, and in 1835 the perpetual curacy of St Thomas’s, Southwark. In 1833-1834 he was professor of divinity at Durham, a post which ill-health forced him to resign. In 1836 he became editor of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Metropolitan,</hi>  and he projected the <hi rend="italic">New General Biographical Dictionary,</hi>  a scheme carried through by his brother Henry John Rose (1800-1873). He was appointed principal of King’s College, London, in October 1836, but he was attacked by influenza, and after two years of ill-health he died at Florence on the 22nd of December 1838. Rose was a high-churchman, who to propagate his views in 1832 founded the <hi rend="italic">British Magazine</hi>  and so came into touch with the leaders of the Oxford movement. Out of a conference at his rectory in Hadleigh came the Association of Friends of the Church, formed by R. H. Froude and Wm. Palmer.</p><p>See J. W. Burgon, <hi rend="italic">Lives of Twelve Good Men</hi>  (1891).</p><p>ROSE, WILLIAM STEWART (1775-1843), English poet and translator, second son of George Rose (g.f.), was born in 1775. He was educated at Eton College, and in 1796 was returned to parliament for the borough of Christchurch. In 1800 he accepted the Chiltern hundreds on his appointment as reading clerk of the House of Lords and clerk of the private committees. His first work, <hi rend="italic">A Naval History of the Late War,</hi>  was undertaken at his father’s wish, but he only completed one volume. He produced a free version of the <hi rend="italic">Amadis de Gaul</hi>  from the French text of Herberay des Essarts in 1803, followed by a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Partlnopex de Blois</hi>  (1807) after Le Grand d’Aussy. With <hi rend="italic">Part&amp;nopex</hi>  he printed his ballad of “ The Red King,” and in 1810 appeared <hi rend="italic">The Crusade of King Louis</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">King Edward the Martyr.</hi>  In 1814 he made a prolonged journey through Italy and eastern Europe, spending the year 1817 at Venice, where he married a Venetian lady. <hi rend="italic">The Court and Parliament of Bees,</hi>  a translation of the <hi rend="italic">Animali Parlanti</hi>  of Casti, and <hi rend="italic">Letters from the North of Italy, addressed to Henry</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Hallam, Esq.,</hi>  appeared in 1819. In the same year the publisher Murray offered him £2000 for a translation of Ariosto (T. Moore, <hi rend="italic">Diary,</hi>  14th of April 1819). He had already written an abridged version of Berni’s <hi rend="italic">rifacimento</hi>  of the <hi rend="italic">Orlando Inamorato</hi>  of Boiardo, and had begun his <hi rend="italic">Orlando Furioso translated into English Verse</hi>  which appeared in two parts in 1823 and 1831. This, which has become the standard English version, is a close rendering in the <hi rend="italic">ottava rima</hi>  of the original. Rose retired from his official position in 1824. He suffered from paralysis in his later years, and at Abbotsford, where he was an honoured guest, rooms were specially fitted up on the ground floor for his use. His last works were <hi rend="italic">An Epistle to the Right Honourable John Hookham Frere</hi>  (1834), in verse, and a volume of <hi rend="italic">Rhymes </hi>(1837) (see <hi rend="italic">Quarterly Review,</hi>  July 1836 and April 1837). He died on the 30th of April 1843.</p><p>ROSE <hi rend="italic">{Rosa}.</hi>  The rose has for all ages been the favourite flower, and as such it has a place in general literature that no other plant can rival. In most cases the rose of the poets and the rose of the botanist are one and the same in kind, but popular usage has attached the name rose to a variety of plants whose kinship to the true plant no botanist would for a moment admit. In this place we shall employ the word in its strict botanical significance, and in commenting on it treat it solely from the botanical point of view. The rose gives its name to the order Rosaceae, of which it may be considered the type. The genus consists of species varying in number, according to the diverse opinions of botanists of opposite schools, from thirty to one hundred and eighty, or even two hundred and fifty, exclusive of the many hundreds of mere garden varieties. While the lowest estimate is doubtless too low, the highest is enormously too large, but in any case the wide discrepancies above alluded to illustrate very forcibly the extreme variability of the plants, their adaptability to various conditions, and consequently their wide dispersion over the globe, the facility with which they are cultivated, and the readiness 'with which new varieties are continually being produced in gardens by the art of the hybridizer or the careful selection of the raiser. The species are natives of all parts of the northern hemisphere, but are scantily represented in the tropics unless at considerable elevations.</p><p>They are erect or climbing shrubs, never herbs or trees, generally more or less copiously provided with straight or hooked prickles of various shapes and with glandular hairs, as in the sweet-brier or in the moss-rose of gardens. The prickles serve the purpose of enabling the shrub to sustain itself amid other vegetation. The viscid hairs which are specially frequent on the flower stalks or in the neighbourhood of the flower serve to arrest the progress of undesirable visitants, while the perfume emitted by the glands in question may co-operate with the fragrance and colour of the flower to attract those insects whose presence is desirable. The leaves are invariably alternate, provided with stipules, and unequally pinnate, the leaflets varying in number from one (as in <hi rend="italic">R. simplici-folia</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">berberi folia}</hi>  to 11 and even 15, the odd leaflet always being at the apex, the others in pairs. The flowers are solitary or in loose cymes (eluster-roses) produced on the ends of the snoots. The flower-stalk expands into a vase- or urn-shaped dilatation, called the receptacle or receptacular tube, which ultimately becomes fleshy and encloses in its cavity the numerous carpels or fruits. From the edge of the urn or “ hip !’ proceed five sepals, often more or less compound like the leaves and overlapping in the bud. Within the sepals are five petals, generally broad or roundish in outline, with a very short stalk or none at all, and of very various shades of white, yellow or red. The very numerous stamens originate slightly above the sepals and petals; each has a slender filament and a small two-celled anther. The inner portion of the receptacular tube whence the stamens spring is thick and fleshy, and is occasionally spoken of as the “ disk but, as in this case it does not represent any separate organ, it is better <hi rend="italic">to</hi>  avoid the use of the term. The carpels are very numerous, ultimately hard in texture, covered with hairs, and each provided with a long style and button-like stigma. The carpels are concealed within the receptacular tube and only the stigmas as a rule protrude from its mouth. Each carpel contains one ovule. The so-called fruit is merely the receptacular tube, which, as previously mentioned, becomes fleshy and brightly coloured as an attraction to birds, which devour the hips and thus secure the dispersion of the seed. The dry one-seeaed fruits (achenes) are densely packed inside the hip, and are covered with stiff hairs which cling to the bird’s beak. The stamens are in whorls, and, according to Payer, they originate in pairs one on each side of the base of</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
