<p><span class="font0">ſpeeches you made on thc 9th, 12th, and 14th of July to the deputations of the conſtituent aſſembly, ſhew what&nbsp;were your intentions ; and the maſſacres oſ the ſ hnille-ries rife in evidence againſt you.—What have you to anſwer</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Louis. '“ I</span><span class="font0"> was maſter at that time to order the troops to march ; but I never had an intention of ſhed<sup>1</sup>·&nbsp;ding blood.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prey.“</span><span class="font0"> After theſe events, and in ſpite of thc promiſes which von mafic on the 15th in tlie conſtituent aſſem-bly, and on the 1 7th in the town-houſe of Paris, you&nbsp;have perſiſted in your projects againſt national liberty.&nbsp;You long eluded the execution oſ the decrees of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ι </span><span class="font0">lth of Auguſt, reſpecting the abolition of perſonal&nbsp;ſervitude, the feudal government, and tythes : you&nbsp;long refuſed acknowledging the rights of man ; you&nbsp;doubled the number of the life-guards, and called the&nbsp;regiment of Flanders to Verſailles : you permitted, iu&nbsp;orgies held before your eyes, the national cockade to&nbsp;be trampled under foot, the white cockade to be hoiſt-ed, and the nation to be ſlandered. At laſt, you rendered neceſſary a freſh infurrection, occaſioned the death&nbsp;of -ſeveral citizens, and did not change your language&nbsp;till after your guards had been defeated, when you renewed your perfidious promiſes. 'ſ'he proofs of theſe&nbsp;facts arc in your Gbſervations of the 18th oſ September, in the decrees of the 11th of Auguſt, in the minutes of the conſtituent aſſembly, in the events of Verſailles of the 5th and 6th of October, and in the converſation you had on the ſame day with a deputation of&nbsp;the conſtituent aſſembly, when you told them you would&nbsp;enlighten yourſelf with their councils, and never recede from them.—what have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font0"> “ I have made the obſervations which I thought juſt 011 the two firſt heads. As to the cockade,&nbsp;it is ſalſe ; it did not happen in my preſence.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prof. “</span><span class="font0"> You took an oath at the federation of the 14th of July, which you did not keep. You ſoon&nbsp;tried to corrupt the public opinion, with the aſliſtance&nbsp;of Talon who acted in Paris, and Mirabeau who was&nbsp;to have excited counter-revolutionarv movements in the&nbsp;provinces.—what have you to anſwer?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font0"> &quot; I do not know what happened at that time ; but the whole is anterior to my acceptance of the conſtitution.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prof.</span><span class="font0"> &quot; You laviſhed millions of money to effect this corruption, and you would even uſe popularity as a&nbsp;means of enſlaving the people. Theſe </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">facts </span><span class="font0">are the reſult of a memorial of Talon, on which you have made&nbsp;your marginal comments in your own hand-writing, and&nbsp;of a letter which Laporte wrote to you on the 19th of&nbsp;April; in which, recapitulating a converſation he had&nbsp;with Rivarol, he told you, that the millions which you&nbsp;had been prevailed upon to throw away had been productive of nothing. For a long time you had meditated on a plan of eſeape. A memorial was delivered&nbsp;to you on the 28th oſ February, which pointed out&nbsp;the means ſor you to effect it ; you approve of it by&nbsp;marginal notes.—what have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Louis. “ </span><span class="font0">I felt no greater pleaſure than that of re-lieving the needy : this proves no deſign.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prof</span><span class="font0"> &quot; On the 28th a great number of the nobles and military came into your apartments in the caſtle oſ&nbsp;the Thuilleries to favour that cſcape : you wanted to&nbsp;quit Paris on the 10th of April to go to St Clair , —&nbsp;what have you to anſwer?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font0"> &quot; i his accuſation is abſurd.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prof “</span><span class="font0"> But the reſiſtance of the citizens made you ſenſible that their diſtruſt was great ; you endeavoured&nbsp;to diſcard it by communicating to the conſtituent' aſſembly a letter, which you addreſſed to the agents of&nbsp;the nation near foreign powers, to announce to them&nbsp;that you had freely accepted the conſtitutional articles,&nbsp;which had been preſented to you ; and, notwithſtanding,&nbsp;on the 2iſt you took flight with a ſalſe paſſport. You&nbsp;leſt behind a proteſt againſt theſe ſelf-ſame conſtitutional&nbsp;articles ; you ordered the miniſters to ſign none of the&nbsp;acts iſſued by the National Aſſembly ; and you forbade&nbsp;thc miniſter of juſtice to deliver up the ſeals of ſtate.&nbsp;The public money was laviſhed to inſure the ſuccefs of&nbsp;this treachery, and the public force was to protect it,&nbsp;under the orders of Bouille, who ſhortly before had&nbsp;been charged with the maffacre of Nancy, and to whom&nbsp;you wrote on this head, &quot; to take care of his popularity, becauſc it would be of ſervice to you.” Thcſe&nbsp;facts aie proved by the memorial of the 23d of Febru-ary, with marginal comments in your own hand-writing ; by your declaration of the 20th of June, wholly&nbsp;in your own hand-writing ; by your letter of the 4th&nbsp;of September 1790 to Bouille ; and by a note of the&nbsp;latter, in which he gives you an account of the uſe he&nbsp;made of 993,000 livres, given by you, and employed&nbsp;partly in trepanning the troops who were to eſcort you.&nbsp;—what have you to anſwer ?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lows.</span><span class="font0"> “ I have no knowledge whatever of the me-morial of the 23d of February. As to what relates to my journey to Varennes, I appeal to my declaration to the&nbsp;commiſſaries of the conſtituent aſſembly at that period.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Prof.</span><span class="font0"> &quot; After vour detention at Varennes, the exerciſe of the executive power was ſor a moment ſuſpended in your hands, and yon again formed a conſpiracy. On the 17th of July the blôod of citizens was ſhed in&nbsp;the Champ de Mars. A letter, in your, own hand-writing, written in 1790 to La Fayette, proves that a&nbsp;crirninal coalition fubſiſted between you and La Fayette,&nbsp;to which Mirabeau acceded. The reviſion began under&nbsp;theſe cruel auſpices ; all kinds of corruptions were made&nbsp;uſe of. You have paid for libels, pamphlets, and newf-papers, designed to corrupt the public opinion, to diſ-credit the aſlignats, and to ſupport the caufe of the emigrants. The regiſters of Septeuil ſhcw what immenſe&nbsp;ſums have been made nſe of in theſe liberticide manœuvres.—what have yon to anfwer?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Louis.</span><span class="font0"> “ what happened on the 17th of July has nothing at all to do with me. I know nothing of it.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pre!·</span><span class="font0"> “ You ſeemed to accept the conſtitution on the 14th of kSeptember ; your ſpeeches announced an intention of ſupporting it, and you were buſy in overturning&nbsp;it, even before it was completed A convention was&nbsp;entered into at Pilnitz on the 24th of July, between«&nbsp;Leopold of Auſtria and Frederic-william of Branden-burgh, who pledged themſelves to re-erect in France&nbsp;the throne of 'abſolute monarchy, and you were ſilenL&nbsp;upon this convention till the moment when it was known;&nbsp;by all Europe.—what have you to anfwer?”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lows.</span><span class="font0"> “ I made it known as ſoon as it came to my knowledge ; beſides, every thing that refers to this ſubject concerns the miniſter.”</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
