<p><span class="font0">form some of the writings of Washington Irving, Fenimore Cooper, Bulwer Lytton and Benjamin Disraeli. He also&nbsp;brought out a number of shilling books in “ Routledge’s Universal Library.” Routledge died in London on the 13th of&nbsp;December 1888. After being styled Routledge, Wame &amp;&nbsp;Routledge, his firm changed its name to that of George Rout-ledge &amp; Sons. A branch of the business was established in&nbsp;New York in 1854.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUVIER, MAURICE (1842- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), French statesman, was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">bom at Aix on the 17th of April 1842, and spent the early years of his manhood in‘ business at Marseilles. He supported&nbsp;Gambetta’s candidature there in 1867, and in 1870 he founded&nbsp;an anti-imperial journal, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">U Égalité.</span><span class="font0"> Becoming secretary&nbsp;general of the prefecture of Bouches-du-Rhône in 1870-71,&nbsp;he refused the office of prefect. In July 1871 he was returned&nbsp;to the National Assembly for Marseilles at a by-election, and&nbsp;voted steadily with the Republican party. He became a&nbsp;recognized authority on finance, and repeatedly served on&nbsp;the Budget Commission as reporter or president. At the&nbsp;general elections of 1881 after the fall of the Ferry cabinet&nbsp;he was returned to the chamber on a programme which included&nbsp;the separation of Church and State, a policy of decentralization, and the imposition of an income-tax. He then joined&nbsp;Gambetta’s cabinet as minister of commerce and the colonies,&nbsp;and in the 1883-85 cabinet of Jules Ferry he held the same&nbsp;office. He became premier and minister of finance on the&nbsp;31st of May 1887, with the support of the moderate republican&nbsp;groups, the Radicals holding aloof in support of General&nbsp;Boulanger, who began a violent agitation against the government. Then came the scandal of the decorations in which&nbsp;President Grevy’s son-in-law Daniel Wilson figured, and the&nbsp;Rouvier cabinet fell in the attempt to screen the president.&nbsp;Rouvier’s opposition in his capacity of president of the Budget&nbsp;Commisêion was one of the causes of the defeat of the Floquet&nbsp;cabinet in February 1889. In the new Tirard ministry formed&nbsp;to combat the Boulangist agitation he was minister of finance.&nbsp;This portfolio he retained consecutively in the Freycinet, the&nbsp;Loubet and the Ribot cabinets, 1890-93. His relations with&nbsp;Cornélius Herz and the baron de Reinach compelled his retirement, however, from the Ribot cabinet at the time of the&nbsp;Panama scandals in December 1892. Again, in 1902, he became&nbsp;minister of finance, after nearly ten years in exclusion from&nbsp;office, in the Radical cabinet of M. Combes; and on the fall&nbsp;of the Combes ministry in January 1905 he was invited by&nbsp;the president to form a new ministry. In this cabinet he at&nbsp;first held the ministry of finance. In his initial declaration&nbsp;to the chamber the new premier had declared his intention of&nbsp;continuing the policy of the late cabinet, pledging the new&nbsp;ministry to a policy of conciliation, to the consideration of&nbsp;old age pensions, an income-tax, separation of Church and&nbsp;State. Public attention, however, was chiefly concentrated&nbsp;on foreign policy. During the Combes ministry M. Delcassé&nbsp;had come to a secret understanding with Spain on the Moroccan&nbsp;question, and had established an understanding with England.&nbsp;His policy had aroused German jealousy, which became evident&nbsp;in the asperity with which the question of Morocco was handled&nbsp;in Berlin. At a cabinet meeting on June 5th it is said that&nbsp;M. Rouvier reproached the Foreign Minister with imprudence&nbsp;in the matter of Morocco, and after a heated discussion&nbsp;M. Delcassé gave in his resignation. M. Rouvier himself took&nbsp;the portfolio of foreign affairs at this anxious juncture. He,&nbsp;after critical negotiations, secured on July 8th an agreement with&nbsp;Germany accepting the international conference proposed by&nbsp;the sultan of Morocco on the assurance that Germany would&nbsp;recognize the special nature of the interest of France in maintaining order on the frontier of her Algerian empire. Lengthy&nbsp;discussions resulted in a new convention in September, which&nbsp;contained the programme of the proposed conference, and in&nbsp;December M. Rouvier was able to make a statement of the&nbsp;whole proceedings in the chamber, which received the assent&nbsp;of all parties. M. Rouvier’s government did not long survive&nbsp;the presidential election of 1906. The disturbances arising</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">in connexion with the Separation Law were skilfully handled by M. Clemenceau to discredit the ministry, which gave place&nbsp;to a cabinet under the direction of M. Sarrien.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROVERETO, the most important industrial town in the southern or Italian-speaking portion of the Austrian province&nbsp;of Tirol, though its population (which in 1900 was 10,180,&nbsp;Italian-speaking and Romanist) is less than that of Trent. It&nbsp;is also the principal town of the administrative district of&nbsp;Rovereto. Built on the left bank of the Adige, in the widest&nbsp;portion of the Val Lagarina (the name given to the Adige valley&nbsp;from Acquaviva, above Rovereto, to the Italian frontier), it is&nbsp;divided into two parts by the Leno torrent. It is on the&nbsp;Brenner railway, by which it is 15 m. SAV. of Trent and 41 j m.&nbsp;N. of Verona. Save in the newer quarter of the town, the streets&nbsp;are narrow and crooked, several being named after the most&nbsp;distinguished native of the place, Antonio Rosmini-Serbati&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v). </span><span class="font0">The finest chnrch is that of Santa Maria del Carmine,&nbsp;the old 14th-century church now serving as a sacristy to that&nbsp;built from 1678 to 1750. The church of San Marco dates from&nbsp;the 15th century. The town is dominated by the castle (now&nbsp;used as barracks), which was reconstructed in 1492 by the&nbsp;Venetians, after it had been burnt in 1487 by the count of&nbsp;Tirol. The staple silk industry (which dates from the 16th&nbsp;century) has declined, the number both of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filande</span><span class="font0"> (establishments wherein the cocoons are unwound) and of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filatoje</span><span class="font0"> (those&nbsp;wherein the silk is spun) having diminished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1132 the emperor Lothair found the passage of the gorge above the site of the town barred by a castle, which he took&nbsp;and gave to one of his Teutonic followers, the ancestor of the&nbsp;Castelbarco family. Towards the middle of the 13th century&nbsp;that family obtained by marriage the lands of the Lizzana family&nbsp;(whose castle rises S. of the town), and in 1300 practically&nbsp;founded the town and surrounded it with walls. In 1416 it was&nbsp;taken by the Venetians, who in 1487 successfully resisted, at&nbsp;Calliano, an attempt to take it made by the count of Tirol and&nbsp;the bishop of Trent. In 1509, at the outset of the war of the&nbsp;League of Cambray, the town gave itself voluntarily to the&nbsp;emperor Maximilian, to whom it was ceded formally by Venice&nbsp;in 1517, and next year incorporated with Tirol. South of&nbsp;Rovereto is the village of Marco, near which are certain natural&nbsp;remains (either those of a landslip that occurred in 883, or of a&nbsp;glacier moraine) believed to have been described by Dante&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Inf.</span><span class="font0"> xii. 4-9), who is said to have spent part of the year 1304,&nbsp;during his exile from Florence, in the castle of Lizzana, between&nbsp;Marco and Rovereto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W. A. B. C.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROVIGNO, a seaport of Austria, in Istria, 75 m. S. of Trieste by rail. Pop. (1900) 10,205, mostly Italian. It is situated on&nbsp;the west coast of Istria, and possesses an interesting cathedral,,&nbsp;built on the summit of the promontory Monte di Sant* Eufemia.&nbsp;Its campanile, built after the model of the famous campanile in&nbsp;Venice, is crowned with a bronze statue of St Eufemia, the&nbsp;patron saint of the town, whose remains are preserved in the&nbsp;church. It contains a station of the Berlin Aquarium, with a&nbsp;fine collection of the fauna of the Adriatic Sea. In the neighbourhood are vineyards, which produce the best wine in Istria,&nbsp;and olive gardens, while its hazel-nuts are reputed the finest&nbsp;in the world. Rovigno is the principal centre of the Austrian&nbsp;tunny and sardine fishery. The industries, in addition to shipbuilding and the preservation of fish, include the manufacture&nbsp;of tobacco, cement, macaroni and similar preparations, and&nbsp;flour. There is an active export trade. Its inhabitants are&nbsp;renowned seamen. Rovigno is the ancient </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arupenum</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rubinum,</span><span class="font0"> and according to tradition it was originally built on an&nbsp;island, Cissa by name, which disappeared during the earthquakes about 737. Rovigno passed definitively into the hands&nbsp;of the Venetians in 1330, and it remained true to the republic&nbsp;till the treaty of Campo Formio (1797).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROVIGO, a town of Venetia, Italy, capital of the province of Rovigo. It stands on the low ground between the lower Adige&nbsp;and the lower Po, 50 m. by rail SAV. of Venice and 27 m. S.SAV.&nbsp;of Padua, and on the Adigetto Canal, 17 ft. above sea-level.&nbsp;Pop. (1901) 6038 (town); 10,735 (commune). It is a station</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
