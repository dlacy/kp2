<p><span class="font1">wards the Caspian, without coming into contact on the east  with the mountain systems of Asia. It is called at different points the Orenburg, Baschkir, and Kirghis Urals, and&nbsp;sends out an offshoot on the south-west, between the rivers&nbsp;Ural and Samara, the Obschtschei-Syrt, which stretches to&nbsp;the banks of the Volga. The Sok Mountains form a part&nbsp;of this spur of tire Urals. There are seven defiles or passes&nbsp;through this great range, the most practicable of which are&nbsp;the roads from Perm and Orenburg into Asia. Between the&nbsp;southern declivities of the Urals and the Caspian Sea and&nbsp;Aral, there is an opening of about two hundred and eighty&nbsp;miles in breadth, through which, more than once, the hordes&nbsp;of Asia in former times have poured like a flood over Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Steppes, or plains, are an important feature of the geography of Russia, as well as of that of Tartary, with which the term is more frequently associated. The most important of&nbsp;these are the following: 1. The Steppe of Petchora, which&nbsp;stretches along both sides of the rivers Dvina and Petchora,&nbsp;from the Icy Ocean and White Sea, to the northern part of&nbsp;the government of Vologda. It is called Tundra, and consists of turf-moor covered with moss. In the north it is&nbsp;destitute of wood; in the south it is thickly wooded, and has&nbsp;many small fresh-water lakes. 2. The little Jaroslav Steppe,&nbsp;situated between Koslov and Tambov, a plain rich in flowers,&nbsp;and fifty versts @@<sup>1</sup> in diameter. In connection with it may be&nbsp;mentioned the great steppe between Tambov and Kopersk,&nbsp;which is plentifully supplied with water, very fruitful, and&nbsp;rich in vegetables and pasture. 3. The Steppe of the Don,&nbsp;belonging to the Don Cossacks. This immense plain, wholly&nbsp;destitute of hills, is about 57,600 geographical square miles&nbsp;in extent; in some parts it is fruitful, but in general the&nbsp;soil is barren and uncultivated. 4. The Kuban Steppe, extending from Kuban to the Manitch. The soil is very unproductive, and rests on a bed of sandy limestone. 5. The&nbsp;Steppe of Azof, which extends on both sides of the Lower&nbsp;Manitch, to the Sea of Azof and the Lower Don ; but it is&nbsp;as worthless as the former. 6. The Steppe of Taurida, a&nbsp;gentle declivity of the northerly and easterly mountains of&nbsp;Taurida, inclining towards Kertsch and the Bosphorus, the&nbsp;Putrid Sea (a branch of the Sea of Azof), and the Straits of&nbsp;Perekop. The soil near the mountains is poor and unproductive ; but farther down it becomes clayey and fruitful,&nbsp;and towards the sea is impregnated with salt. Similar to&nbsp;the Steppe of Taurida are those of Vosnesenks and Otcha-kof. 7. The Steppe of Nogais on the Black Sea and the&nbsp;Sea of Azof, from the Lower Don to the Lower Dnieper. It&nbsp;is a dry unwooded tract, of some value to the wandering&nbsp;tribes, but nearly useless to the settled countryman. 8. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Steppe of Astracan, stretching between the Don, the Volga, and the Caucasus; and, 9. the Steppe of Kalmytz. According to Pallas, both of these immense plains must at one&nbsp;time have been covered with the waters of the Caspian Sea.&nbsp;But, in fact, the whole country appears at some period of&nbsp;remote antiquity to have lain beneath the tide of the ocean.&nbsp;Two large oases must be noticed as occurring in the midst&nbsp;of these steppes ; they form the country of the Little Russians, and that of the Don Cossacks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">M. Huot, in his new edition of Malte-Brun’s great geographical work, thus mentions the rivers of Russia. “ The soil of Russia is so slightly undulated, that to consider&nbsp;the spaces traversed by its rivers as true basins, would be&nbsp;an abuse of terms; notwithstanding that it contains the&nbsp;most important water-courses in Europe. It would not perhaps be more exact to apply the same name to the Black,&nbsp;Caspian, and Baltic Seas, or to the Icy Ocean, in one or&nbsp;other of which all its waters disembogue. I prefer designating by the denomination of declivities the inclination of&nbsp;the. soil to these several seas, and hence shall term them&nbsp;the Tauric, Caspian, Icy, and Baltic declivities. The Tau-ric, to which I give the name because all the water-courses&nbsp;which descend on this side have their embouchures around&nbsp;the peninsula of Taurida, is watered by the Dniester, the&nbsp;Dnieper, the Bog, and the Don; the Caspian, the waters&nbsp;of which fall into the sea of that name, is furrowed by the&nbsp;Terek, the Volga, and the Ural; the Icy declivity, formed&nbsp;by the tracts which incline towards the White Sea and Icy&nbsp;or Frozen Ocean, is watered by the Petchora, the Mezen,&nbsp;and the Northern Dvina; lastly, the Baltic comprehends all&nbsp;the streams which fall into the Baltic, the most important&nbsp;being the Torneo or Tornea, the Neva, the Southern Dvina&nbsp;or the Dvina, and the Niemen.” Some eminent German&nbsp;geographers have also adopted this plan of classifying the&nbsp;rivers according to the seas into which they discharge themselves ; and as it has several advantages over the usual method of describing the streams of a country in the order of&nbsp;their size and importance, we shall follow it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the declivity which slopes to the Black Sea and the Sea of Azof, there is, 1. the Danube, whose northern arm forms&nbsp;part of the southern boundary between Russia and Turkey.&nbsp;Below Galatz it receives its last tributary the Pruth, which&nbsp;descends from the mountains of Gallicia or Austrian Poland, and separates Bessarabia in Russia from Moldavia in&nbsp;Turkey. 2. The Dniester, which rises also in Gallicia, and&nbsp;flows with many serpentine windings towards Russia. Below Chotzim it is broken by rapids, so that near Bender&nbsp;boat-navigation is interrupted, and without receiving any&nbsp;tributaries of importance it falls into the Black Sea at the&nbsp;broad but shallow estuary or Lake of Ovidovo. 3. The&nbsp;Dnieper, which has its source in the government of Smolen-sko, on the southern slope of the Volkouski Wood, and empties itself into the Black Sea below Kerson. This noble&nbsp;stream receives many tributaries, amongst which, on .the&nbsp;right, flow in the Berezina, the Priepetz, and the Bug, and on&nbsp;the left the Soj, the Desna, the Sem, Sula, Psiol, Vorskla,&nbsp;and others. This river is the ancient Borystlienes. It is&nbsp;connected by canals with the Dvina and the Niemen. 4.&nbsp;The Don, which originates in the small lake of Ivanovsko,&nbsp;in the government of Riasan. After intersecting the Cossack territory to which it gives name, it discharges itself below Tcherkask into the Sea of Azof, by several mouths.&nbsp;In summer it is shallow; in spring it overflows its low banks&nbsp;to a great extent, and forms unhealthy morasses. By means&nbsp;of navigable canals it is connected with the rivers Shat,&nbsp;Upa, Oka, and Volga. Its principal affluents on the right&nbsp;are the Sosna and Donetz, and on the left the Voronej (on&nbsp;which stream Peter the Great built his ships for the Black&nbsp;Sea), the Khoper, Medveditsa, anti the Manitch. 5. The&nbsp;Kuban, which descends from the northern side of Elburz&nbsp;in the Caucasus, flows first north and then west, upon the&nbsp;boundary between Asia and Europe. It separates into two&nbsp;main branches, the northern of which falls into the Sea of&nbsp;Azof, and the southern into the Black Sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> As we shall have frequent occasion to mention Russian weights anil measures, we here present a table, to which the reader can refer, in order to understand what the calculations are equivalent to in English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A verst is 3520 English feet; consequently three versts are equal to two English miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A dessaitine is equal to 2<sub>T</sub>’<sub>3</sub>ths English acres nearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A chetwert is equal to 5-952 Winchester bushels; consequently 100 chetwerts are equivalent to 74-4 English quarters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A vedro is equal to 3Jth English wine gallons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A rouble, that is, a paper rouble, the only basis of commercial calculations, is equal to lOJd., which is very nearly the value of a French franc. But the rouble fluctuates with the exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A pood or poud is always reckoned in commerce as equal to thirty-six pounds English.</span></p>
