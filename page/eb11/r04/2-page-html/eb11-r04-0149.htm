<p><span class="font0">usually form part of the army, and were only enrolled in it in seasons of emergency. Nevertheless the army was not only&nbsp;national, but became increasingly democratic, so that in the&nbsp;ioth century it included every class of inhabitants except&nbsp;churchmen and slaves. At that period we sometimes find the&nbsp;whole people designated as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">exercitus,</span><span class="font0"> those actually under&nbsp;arms being distinguished as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">militia exercitus Romani.</span><span class="font0"> This again was divided into bands or ‘‘numbers,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> regiments, and also, in a manner peculiar to Rome,&nbsp;into </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scholae militum.</span><span class="font0"> These </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scholae</span><span class="font0"> were associations derived&nbsp;from antiquity, gaining strength and becoming more general&nbsp;in the middle ages as the central power of the state declined.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scholae</span><span class="font0"> of notaries, of church singers, and of nearly every leading employment; there were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scholae</span><span class="font0"> of foreigners&nbsp;of diverse nationalities, of Franks, Lombards, Greeks, Saxons,&nbsp;&amp;c. Even the trades and crafts began to form </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scholae.</span><span class="font0"> These&nbsp;were at first very feeble institutions, and only later gained&nbsp;importance and became gilds. As early as the 8th century there&nbsp;were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scholae militum</span><span class="font0"> in the army, which was thus doubly&nbsp;divided. But we have no precise definition of their functions.&nbsp;They were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font0"> corporations with separate property, churches&nbsp;and magistrates of their own. The latter were always </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">optimates,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and guarded the interests of the army. But the real chiefs of&nbsp;the bands or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">numeri</span><span class="font0"> were the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duces</span><span class="font0"> or tribunes, and under the&nbsp;Franks the latter became </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comités.</span><span class="font0"> These chiefs were styled&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">magnifici consules, optimates de militia</span><span class="font0">, often too </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices de&nbsp;militiaj</span><span class="font0"> since, as was the custom of the middle ages, they wielded&nbsp;political and judicial as well as military authority. The title of&nbsp;consul was now generally given to superior officers, whether&nbsp;civil or military. The importance of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scholae militum&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">began to decline in the ioth century; towards the middle&nbsp;of the 12th they disappeared altogether, and, according to&nbsp;Felix Papencordt, were last mentioned in 1145. It is probable&nbsp;that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scholae militum</span><span class="font0"> signified local divisions of the army,&nbsp;corresponding with the city wards, which were twelve in number&nbsp;during the ioth and nth centuries, then increased to thirteen,&nbsp;and occasionally to fourteen. It is certain that from the beginning the army was distributed under twelve flags; after the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scholae</span><span class="font0"> had disappeared, we find it classified in districts, which&nbsp;were subdivided into companies. The division of cities into&nbsp;quarters, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sestieri</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rioni,</span><span class="font0"> corresponding with that of the army,&nbsp;and also with that of the municipal government, was the&nbsp;common practice of Florence, Siena and almost all the Italian&nbsp;communes. But, while usually losing importance as the gilds&nbsp;acquired power, in Rome the insignificance of the gilds added&nbsp;to the strength of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regioni</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rioni,</span><span class="font0"> which not only became&nbsp;part of the army but finally grasped the reins of government.&nbsp;This was a special characteristic of the political constitution&nbsp;of the Roman commune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We now come to a question of weightier import for all desiring to form a clear idea of the Roman government at that period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">What had become of the senate ? It had undoubtedly lost its original character now that the empire was&nbsp;extinct. But, after much learned discussion, historical&nbsp;authorities are still divided upon the subject. Certain&nbsp;Italian writers of the 18th century—Vendettini, for&nbsp;example—asserted with scanty critical insight that the&nbsp;Roman senate did not disappear in the middle ages. The&nbsp;same opinion backed by much learned research was maintained&nbsp;by the gréât German historian Savigny. And Leo, while&nbsp;denying the persistence of the curia in Lombard Italy, adhered&nbsp;to Savigny’s views as regarded Rome. Papencordt did the&nbsp;same, but held the Roman senate to be no more than a curia.&nbsp;This judgment was vigorously contested, first by Hegel and&nbsp;Giesebrecht, then by Gregorovius. These writers believe that&nbsp;after the middle of the 6th century the senate had a merely&nbsp;nominal existence. According to Gregorovius its last appearance was in the year 579. After that date it is mentioned in no&nbsp;documents, and the chroniclers are either equally silent or&nbsp;merely allude to its decay and extinction. In the 8th century,&nbsp;however, the terms </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">senator, senatores, senatus</span><span class="font0"> again reappear.&nbsp;Wc find letters addressed to Pippin, beginning thus: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Omnis&nbsp;senatus atque universi populi generalitas.</span><span class="font0"> When Leo III. returned from Germany he was met by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tarn proceres clericorum&nbsp;cum omnibus clericis, quamque optimates ei senatus, cunctaque&nbsp;militia</span><span class="font0"> (see Anastasius, in Muratori, vol. iii. 198c). But it has&nbsp;been noted that the senate was never found to act as a political&nbsp;assembly; on occasions when it might have been mentioned&nbsp;in that capacity we hear nothing of it, and only meet with it in&nbsp;ceremonials and purely formal functions/ Hence the conclusion&nbsp;that the term </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">senator</span><span class="font0"> was used in the sense of noble, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">senatus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of nobility, and no longer referred to an institution hut only to a&nbsp;class of the citizens. Even when we find that the emperor&nbsp;Otto III. (who sought to revive all the ancient institutions of&nbsp;Rome) addressed an edict to the “ consuls and senate of Rome,”&nbsp;and read that the laws of St Stephen were issued </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">senatus decreto,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the learned Giesebrecht merely remarks that no important&nbsp;changes in the Roman constitution are to be attributed to&nbsp;the consuls and senate introduced by Otto III. Thus for the&nbsp;next glimpse of the senate we must pass to the 12th century,&nbsp;when it was not only reformed, as some writers believe, but&nbsp;entirely reconstituted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But in this case a serious difficulty remains to be disposed of. Gregorovius firmly asserts that the nobles acquired great&nbsp;power between the 7th and ioth centuries, not only filling the&nbsp;highest military, judicial and ecclesiastical offices, “ but also&nbsp;directing the municipal government, presumably with the&nbsp;prefect at their head.” He further adds: “ Notwithstanding&nbsp;the disappearance of the senate, it is difficult to suppose that&nbsp;the city was without governing magistrates, or without a&nbsp;council.” Thus, after the 7th century, tlje </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">optimates</span><span class="font0"> at the&nbsp;head of the army were also at the head of the citizens, and&nbsp;“ formed a communal council in the same manner in which&nbsp;it was afterwards formed by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi”@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font0"> Now, if the nobles&nbsp;were called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">senatores</span><span class="font0"> and the nobility </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">senatus,</span><span class="font0"> and if this body&nbsp;of nobles met in council to administer the affairs of the republic,&nbsp;there is no matter for dispute, inasmuch as all are agreed that&nbsp;the original senate must have had a different character from&nbsp;the senate of the middle ages. And, since the absence of all&nbsp;mention of a prefect after the 7 th century is not accepted as a&nbsp;proof of his non-existence, and we find him reappear under&nbsp;another form in the 8th century, so the silence as to the senate&nbsp;after the year 579, the fresh mention of it in the 8th century,&nbsp;and its reappearance in the 12th as a firmly reconstituted body&nbsp;reasonably lead to the inference that, during that time, the&nbsp;ancient senate had been gradually transformed into the new&nbsp;council. Its meetings must have been held very irregularly,&nbsp;and probably only in emergencies when important affairs had&nbsp;to be discussed, previously to bringing them before the parliament or general assembly of the people. Historians&nbsp;are better agreed as to the significance of the term&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">consul.</span><span class="font0"> At first this was simply a title of honour&nbsp;bestowed on superior magistrates, and retained that meaning&nbsp;from the 7th to the nth century, but then became—as mother&nbsp;Italian cities—a special title of the chief officers of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During this period the Roman constitution was very simple. The duke, commanding the army, and the prefect, presiding&nbsp;over the criminal court, were the chiefs of the republic; the&nbsp;armed nobility constituted the forces, filled all of superior offices,&nbsp;and occasionally met in a council called the senate, although it&nbsp;had, as we have said, no resemblance to the senate of older times.&nbsp;In moments of emergency a general parliament of the people&nbsp;was convoked. This constitution differed little from that of&nbsp;the other Italian communes, where, in the same way, we find all&nbsp;the leading citizens under arms, a parliament, a council, and one&nbsp;or more chiefs at the head of the government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But Rome had an element that was lacking elsewhere. We have already noted that, in the provinces, the administrators&nbsp;of church lands were important personages, and exercised&nbsp;during the middle ages, when there was no exact division of&nbsp;power, both judicial and political functions. It was very&nbsp;natural that the heads of this vast administration resident in&nbsp;Rome should have a still higher standing, and in fact, from the</span></p><div>
