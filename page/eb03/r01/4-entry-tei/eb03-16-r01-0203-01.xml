the buckthorn, in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the pentan-dria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 43d order, <hi rend="italic">Dumofœ.</hi> The calyx is tubulous, with five minute ſcales ſurrounding the ſtamina ; there is no corolla ; the fruit is a berry. There are 27 ſpe-cies ; of which the moſt remarkable are,</p><p>I. The catharticus, or common purging buckthorn, growing naturally in ſome parts of Britain. This glows to the height of. 12 or 14 feet, with many irregular branches at the extremities. The leaves are oval-lan-ceolate, finely ſerrated on the edges, their nerves con-verging together. The flowers grow in cluſters, one on each footſtalk, white, and in this ſpecies divided into four ſegments : the fruit is a round black berry, containing four feeds. The juice of the berries is a</p><p>ſtrong purgative, and is made ufe of for making the common ſyrup of buckthorn kept in the ſhops. The bark is emetic : the juice of the unripe berries with alum dyes yellow, of the ripe ones a ſine green ; the bark alſo dyes yellow. The green colour yielded by the berries, called by the French <hi rend="italic">verde-vefjie,</hi> is much eſteemed by miniature painters.</p><p>Of this ſpecies there are two varieties, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the dwarf buckthorn, a ſhrub of about a yard high, of a greeniſh colour but little ſhow; and the long-leaved dwarf buck-thorn, which is a larger ſhrub, with leaves fomewhat larger, but in other reſpects very ſimilar to tlie dwarf buckthorn.</p><p>2. The zizyphus is the ſpecies in which the lac in-ſect* forms its cells, and produces the wax callecl <hi rend="italic">gum-lac.</hi> See Lacca.</p><p>3. The lotus has the leaves, prickles, flowers, and fruit, of the zizyphus or jubeb ; only with this difference, that the fruit is here round, ſmaller, and more lufeious, and at the ſame time the branches, like thofe of the paliurus, are neither ſo much jointed nor crook-ed. Ί he fruit is in great repute, taſtes ſomething like gingerbread, and is fold in the markets all over the ſouthern diſtricts of theſe kingdoms. The Arabs call it <hi rend="italic">aneb enta el feedra,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the jubeb of the feedra ;</hi> which Olavus Celſius had ſo high an opinion of, that he has deſcribed it as the dudaim of the ſcriptures. This ſpe-cies is very common in the Jereede and other parts of Bombay ; and has been ſuppoſed by ſome to be the ſame plant with that celebrated by Homer for its en-chanting property; though the latter is more generally ſuppoſed to have been a ſpecies of Diospyros (which ſee). It is proper, however, to diſtinguiſh between both theſe ſhrubs and an herb often mentioned by the ancients under the name of <hi rend="italic">lotus,</hi> which Homer men-tions as being fed upon by the horſes of Achilles, and Virgil as proper to increafe the milk of ſheep (ſee Lotus). They are alſo different from the Egyptian lo« tus deſcribed by Herodotus; ſor which ſee Nym-PHÆA.</p><p>4. The frangula, or berry-bearing alder, is a deciduous ſhrub, a native of England and moſt of the north-era parts of Europe, and affords ſeveral varieties.</p><p>5. The Alpine, rough-leaved frangula, or berrybearing alder, is alſo a deciduous ſhrub, and native of the Alps. It differs in no reſpect from the common fort, except that it has no thorns, and that it will grow to be rather taller, with tough, large, and doubly laci-niated leaves. The ſmooth-leaved Alpine frangula is a variety of this ſpecies, with ſmooth leaves and of a lower growth.</p><p>6. The paliurus, or thorn of Chriſt, is a deciduous ſhrub or tree, a native of Paleſtine, Spain, Portugal, and Italy. It will grow to nearly the height of 14,</p>

<p>ſect, and is armed with ſharp thorns, two oſ which are at each joint, one oſ which is about half an inch long, ſtraight, and upright ; the other is ſcarcely half that length, and bent backward ; and between them is the bud ſor next year’s ſhoot. June is the time oi flowering, and the flowers are ſucceeded by a ſmall fruit, ſur-roundedby a membrane. " This plant (ſays Hanbury) is undoubtedly the ſort oſ which the crown oſ thorns ſor our Bleffed Saviour was compoſed. The branches are very pliant, and the ſpines oſ it are at every joint ſtrong and ſharp. It grows naturally about Jeruſalem, as well as in many parts of Judæa ; and there is no doubt that the barbarous Jews would make choice oſ it ſor their cruel purpoſe. But what farther confirms the truth oſ theſe thorns being then uſed, are the an-cieut pictures oſ our Bleffed Saviour’s crucifixion. The thorns oſ the crown on his head exactly anſwer to thoſe oſ this tree ; and there is great reaſon to ſuppoſe theſe were taken ſrom the. earlieſt paintings oſ tlie Lord oſ Life : and even now our modern painters copy ſrom tliem, and repreſent the crown as compoſed oſ theſe thorns. Thefe plants, therefore, ſhonld principally liave a ſhare in thoſe parts of tlie plantation that are more peculiarly deſigned ſor religious retirement ; for tliey will prove excellent monitors, and conduce to due reflection on and gratitude to ‘ Him who hath loved us, and lias waſhed us from our fuis,” &amp;c.</p><p>7. The common alaternus is an evergreen tree, and native of the ſouth of Europe. There are ſeveral varieties of this ſpecies ; the moſt remarkable of which are the broad-leaved and tbe jagged-leaved alaternus, which have all been confounded with the phillyrea.</p><p>8. The inſectorius, or narrow-leaved buckthorn, is an evergreen ſhrub or tree, and native of Spain. It grows to the height of 10 or 12 feet, and fends forth ſeveral branches from the bottom to the top. They are co-vered with a blackiſh or dark-coloured bark, and each of them is terminated by a long ſharp thorn. The fruit continues on the trees all winter, making a beautiful appearance among the narrow-cluttered leaves at that ſeaſon.</p><p>9. The oleoides, or olive-leaved buckthorn, is an evergreen ſhrub, and native of Spain, and grows to the height oſ 8 or 1 o ſeet. It fends forth numerous branclies, each of which is terminated by a long ſharp ſpine. The flowers are ſmall, of a whitiſh green colour, and are ſuc-ceeded by round black berries.</p>
