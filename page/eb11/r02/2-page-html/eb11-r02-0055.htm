<p><span class="font1">It has been impossible to avoid an air of superficiality, and the repetition of facts known to every schoolboy, in this sketch&nbsp;of so complicated a subject as the Renaissance,—embracing many nations, a great variety of topics and&nbsp;an indefinite period of time. Yet no other treatment&nbsp;was possible upon the Hnes laid down at the outset,&nbsp;where it was explained why the term Renaissance&nbsp;cannot now be confined to the Revival of Learning&nbsp;and the effect of antique studies upon literary&nbsp;and artistic ideals. The purpose of this article has been&nbsp;to show that, while the Renaissance implied a new way of&nbsp;regarding the material world and human nature, a new conception of man’s destiny and duties on this planet, a new culture&nbsp;and new intellectual perceptions penetrating every sphere of&nbsp;thought and energy, it also invoIved new reciprocal relations&nbsp;between the members of the European group of nations. The&nbsp;Renaissance closed the middle ages and opened the modern era,&nbsp;—not merely because the mental and moral ideas which then&nbsp;sprang into activity and owed their force in large measure to&nbsp;the revival of classical learning were opposed to medieval&nbsp;modes of thinking and feeling, but also because the political&nbsp;and international relations specific to it as an age were at&nbsp;variance with fundamental theories of the past. Instead of&nbsp;empire and church, the sun and moon of the medieval system,&nbsp;a federation of peoples, separate in type and divergent in&nbsp;interests, yet bound together by common tendencies, common&nbsp;culture and common efforts, came into existence. For obedience to central authority was substituted balance of power.&nbsp;Henceforth the hegemony of Europe attached to no crown,&nbsp;imperial or papal, but to the nation which was capable of&nbsp;winning it, in the spiritual region by mental ascendancy, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in the temporal by force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That this is the right way of regarding the subject appears from the events of the first two decades of the 16th century,&nbsp;those years in which the humanistic revival attained its&nbsp;highest point in Italy. Luther published his theses in&nbsp;1517, sixty-four years after the fall of Constantinople,&nbsp;twenty-three years after the expedition of Charles&nbsp;VIII. to Naples, ten years before the sack of&nbsp;Rome, at a moment when France, Spain and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">England had only felt the influences of Italian culture but feebly. From that date forward two parties wrestled for&nbsp;supremacy in Europe, to which may be given the familiar&nbsp;names of Liberalism and Conservatism, the party of progress and the party of established institutions. The triumph&nbsp;of the former was most signal among the Teutonic peoples.&nbsp;The Latin races, championed by Spain and supported by the&nbsp;papacy, fought the battle of the latter, and succeeded for a&nbsp;time in roUing back the tide of revolutionary conquest. Meanwhile that Hberal culture which had been created for Europe&nbsp;by the ItaHans before the contest of the Reformation began&nbsp;continued to spread, although it was stifled in Italy and Spain,&nbsp;retarded in France and the Low Counjtries, well-nigh extirpated&nbsp;by wars in Germany, and diverted from its course in England&nbsp;by the counter-movement of Puritanism. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">autos da fê</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Seville and Madrid, the flames to which Bruno, Dolet and&nbsp;Paleario were flung, the dungeon of Campanella and the seclusion of GaHleo, the massacre of St Bartholomew and the faggots&nbsp;of Smithfield, the desolated plains of Germany and the cruelties&nbsp;of Alva in the Netherlands, disillusioned Europe of those golden&nbsp;dreams which had arisen in the earHer days of humanism, and&nbsp;which had been so pleasantly indulged by Rabelais. In truth&nbsp;the Renaissance was ruled by no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Astraea redux,</span><span class="font1"> but rather by a&nbsp;severe spirit which brought no peace but a sword, reminding&nbsp;men of sternest duties, testing what of moral force and tenacity&nbsp;was in them, compelling them to strike for the old order or the new,&nbsp;suffering no Iukewarm halting between two opinions. That,&nbsp;in spite of retardation and retrogression, the old order of&nbsp;ideas should have yielded to the new all over Europe,—that&nbsp;science should have won firm standing-ground, and political&nbsp;Hberty should have struggled through those birth-throes of its&nbsp;origin,—was in the nature of things.

<p><span class="font1">RENAIX, a town of Belgium in the province of East Flanders, 8 m. S. of Oudenarde. It has extensive dyeworks, bleaching&nbsp;grounds and manufactories for Hncn and woollen goods. Pop.&nbsp;(1904) 20,760.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RENAN, ERNEST (1823-1892), French philosopher and Orientalist, was born on the 27th of February 1823 at Tréguier.&nbsp;His father’s people were of the fisher-clan of Renans or Ronans;&nbsp;his grandfather, having made a small fortune by his fishing&nbsp;smack, bought a house at Tréguier and settled there, and his&nbsp;father, captain of a small cutter and an ardent Republican,&nbsp;married the daughter of Royalist trading-folk from the neighbouring town of Lannion. All his life Renan was divided&nbsp;between his father’s and his mother’s political beHefs. He was&nbsp;only five years old when his father died, and hjs sister Henriette,&nbsp;twelve years older than Ernest, a girl of remarkable character,&nbsp;was henceforth morally the head of the household. Having in&nbsp;vain attempted to keep a school for girls at Tréguier, she left her&nbsp;native place and went to Paris as teacher in a young ladies’&nbsp;boarding-school. Ernest meanwhile was educated in the&nbsp;ecclesiastical seminary of his native place. His good-conduct&nbsp;notes for this period describe him as “ docile, patient, diligent,&nbsp;painstaking, thorough.” We do not hear that he was brilHant,&nbsp;but the priests cared little for such qualities. While the priests&nbsp;were grounding him in mathematics and Latin, his mother&nbsp;completed his education. She was only half a Breton. Her&nbsp;paternal ancestors came from Bordeaux, and Renan used to say&nbsp;that in his own nature the Gascon and the Breton were constantly at odds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the summer of 1838 Renan carried off all the prizes at the college of Tréguier. His sister in Paris told the doctor of the&nbsp;school in which she taught about the success of her brother,&nbsp;and he carried the news to F. A. P. Dupanloup, then engaged in&nbsp;organizing the ecclesiastical college of St Nicholas du Chardonnet, a school in which the young CathoHc nobility and the&nbsp;most gifted pupils of the Catholic seminaries were to be educated&nbsp;together, with a view to cementing the bond between the&nbsp;aristocracy and the priesthood. Dupanloup sent for Renan at&nbsp;once. He was fifteen and a half. He had never been outside&nbsp;his Breton province. “ I learned with stupor that knowledge&nbsp;was not a privilege of the church ... I awoke to the meaning&nbsp;of the words talent, fame, celebrity.” Above all, reHgion seemed&nbsp;to him wholly different in Tréguier and in Paris. The superficial, brilHant, pseudo-scientific Catholicism of the capital did not&nbsp;satisfy Renan, who had accepted the austere faith of his Breton&nbsp;masters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1840 Renan left St Nicholas to study philosophy at the seminary of Issy. He entered with a passion for CathoHc&nbsp;scholasticism. The rhetoric of St Nicholas had wearied him,&nbsp;and his serious intelligence hoped to satisfy itself with the vast&nbsp;and solid material of Catholic theology. Reid and Malebranche&nbsp;first attracted him among the philosophers, and after these he&nbsp;turned to Hegel, Kant and Herder. Renan began to perceive&nbsp;the essential contradiction between the metaphysics which he&nbsp;studied and the faith that he professed, but an appetite for&nbsp;truths that can be verified restrained his scepticism. “ Philosophy excites and only half satisfies the appetite for truth; I&nbsp;am eager for mathematics,” he wrote to his sister Henriette.&nbsp;Henriette had accepted in the family of Count Zamoyski an engagement more lucrative than her former place. She exercised</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
