<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">He began as a dramatist, and this his first ambition shaped and coloured his work to the end. It was his own wish&nbsp;that the word “ dramatist </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> should stand first in the description of his occupations on his tombstone. He was&nbsp;dramatist first and novelist afterwards, not merely chronologically but in his aims as an author, always having an&nbsp;eye to stage-effect in scene and situation as well as in&nbsp;dialogue. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gold,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> his first play (1850), was but a moderate&nbsp;success. He did not achieve popularity till 1856, when&nbsp;he produced </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">It <sup>,</sup>s Never Too Late to Mend</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, a novel written&nbsp;with the purpose of reforming abuses in prison discipline&nbsp;and the treatment of criminals. The prosecution of his&nbsp;moral purpose carried him too far for most of his readers;&nbsp;he described prison life with a minuteness and fidelity—&nbsp;the result of laborious studies of blue-books and newspapers&nbsp;and personal inquiries—which become at times tedious and&nbsp;revolting; but the power of the descriptions was undeniable, and the interest of the story, in spite of all overelaboration of painful details, was profound and thrilling.&nbsp;The truth of some of his details was challenged, and the&nbsp;novelist showed himself a pungent controversialist. From&nbsp;first to last he defended himself with vigour and great&nbsp;strength of language against all attempts to rebut his contentions or damage his literary property. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">It <sup>,</sup>s Never Too&nbsp;Late to Mend</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> was his first great success, but before this&nbsp;he had gained the respect of critics with two shorter&nbsp;novels, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peg Woffington</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1852), a close study of life and&nbsp;character behind the scenes, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Christie Johnstone</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1853),&nbsp;an equally close study of Scotch fisher folk, an extraordinary </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tour de force</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> for the son of an English squire, whether&nbsp;we consider the dialect or the skill with which he enters&nbsp;into alien habits of thought. He had also established his&nbsp;position as a dramatist by writing (in combination with&nbsp;Mr Tom Taylor) a stage version of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Peg Woffington</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> under&nbsp;the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Masks and Faces</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1854), the most successful&nbsp;and the most frequently reproduced of his plays, besides&nbsp;three that were less successful, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Courier of Lyons</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (a&nbsp;powerful melodrama), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Two Loves and a Life,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The King's&nbsp;Rivals</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1854). From 1856 onwards he kept his position&nbsp;in the foremost rank of contemporary novelists. Five&nbsp;minor novels followed in quick succession,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Course&nbsp;of True Love never did Run Smooth</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1857), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jack of all&nbsp;Trades</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1858), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Autobiography of a Thief</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1858), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Love&nbsp;Me Little, Love Me Long</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1859), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Double Marriage, or&nbsp;White Lies</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1860). Then appeared, in 1861, what most&nbsp;critics regard as his masterpiece, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Cloister and the&nbsp;Heart¡{.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> He had dealt with the subject two years before&nbsp;in a short story in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Once a Week,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> but, seeing its capabilities,&nbsp;he returned to it and expanded it into its present form.&nbsp;As a picture of manners it is broad and full; yet amply&nbsp;as the novelist illustrates the times he very rarely becomes&nbsp;tedious or allows the thrilling interest of the story to lapse.&nbsp;Returning from the 15th century to modern English life,&nbsp;he next produced another startling novel with a purpose,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hard Cash</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1863), in which he strove to direct attention&nbsp;to the abuses of private lunatic asylums. Three more such&nbsp;novels, in two of which at least the moral purpose, though&nbsp;fully kept in view, was not allowed to obstruct the rapid&nbsp;flow of thrilling incident, were afterwards undertaken,—&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foul Play</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1869), in which he exposed the iniquities of&nbsp;ship-knackers, and paved the way for the labours of Mr&nbsp;Plimsoll; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Put Yourself in his Place</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1870), in which he&nbsp;grappled with the tyrannous outrages of trades-unions;&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Woman-Hater</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1877), in which he gave a helping&nbsp;hand to the advocates of woman’s rights. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wandering&nbsp;Heir</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1875), of which he also wrote a version for the stage,&nbsp;was suggested by the Tichborne trial. Outside the line of&nbsp;these moral and occasional works Reade produced three&nbsp;that might be classified as psychological, inasmuch as they&nbsp;were elaborate studies of character,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Griffith Gaunt</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1866),</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Terrible Temptation</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1871), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Simpleton</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1873). The first of these was in his own opinion the best of his novels,&nbsp;and his own opinion was probably right. He was wrong,&nbsp;however, in his own conception of his powers as a dramatist.&nbsp;At intervals throughout his literary career he sought to&nbsp;gratify his dramatic ambition, hiring a theatre and engaging a company for the representation of his own plays.&nbsp;An example of his persistency was seen in the case of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Foul&nbsp;Play.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> He wrote this in 1869 in combination with Mr Dion&nbsp;Boucicault with a view to stage adaptation. The play&nbsp;was more or less a failure</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> but he produced another version alone in 1877, under the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Scuttled Ship,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;the failure was pronounced. His greatest success as a&nbsp;dramatist attended his last attempt—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Drink</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—an adaptation of Zola’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L'Assommoir,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> produced in 1879. At his&nbsp;death in 1884 (11th April) Reade left behind him a completed novel, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Perilous Secret,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which showed no falling&nbsp;off in the art of weaving a complicated plot and devising&nbsp;thrilling situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">It was characteristic of Reade’s open and combative nature that he admitted the public freely to the secrets of his method of composition. He spoke about his method in his prefaces ; he introduced himself into one of his novels—“Dr Rolfe” in </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A Terrible&nbsp;Temptation ;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and by his will he left his workshop and his accumulation of materials open for inspection for two years after his death.&nbsp;It appears that he had collected an enormous mass of materials for&nbsp;his study of human nature, from personal observation, from newspapers, books of travel, blue-books of commissions of inquiry, from&nbsp;miscellaneous reading. This vast collection of notes, cuttings,&nbsp;extracts, gathered together week by week and year by year, is&nbsp;classified and arranged in huge ledgers and note-books duly paged&nbsp;and indexed. He had planned a great work on </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the wisdom and&nbsp;folly of nations,” dealing with social, political, and domestic&nbsp;details, and it was chiefly for this that his collection was destined,&nbsp;but in passing he found the materials very useful as a store of&nbsp;incidents and suggestions. A collector of the kind was bound to&nbsp;be systematic, otherwise his collection would have fallen into&nbsp;inextricable confusion, and Reade’s collection contains many remarkable curiosities in classification and tabulation. On the&nbsp;value of this method for his art there has been much discussion,&nbsp;the prevalent opinion being that his imagination was overwhelmed&nbsp;and stifled by it. He himself strenuously maintained the contrary ;&nbsp;and it must be admitted that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">priori</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> critics have not rightly&nbsp;understood the use that he made of his laboriously collected facts.&nbsp;He did not merely shovel the contents of his note - books into his&nbsp;novels ; they served rather as an atmosphere of reality in which he&nbsp;worked, so that his novels were like pictures painted in the open&nbsp;air. His imagination worked freely among them and was quickened rather than impeded by their suggestions of things suited to&nbsp;the purpose in hand ; and it is probably to his close and constant&nbsp;contact with facts, acting on an imagination naturally fertile, that&nbsp;we owe his marvellous and unmatchable abundance of incident.&nbsp;Even in his novels of character there is no meditative and analytic&nbsp;stagnation ; the development of character is shown through a rapid&nbsp;unceasing progression of significant facts. This rapidity of movement was perhaps partly the result of his dramatic studies ; it was&nbsp;probably in writing for the stage that he learned the value of keeping the attention of his readers incessantly on the alert. The&nbsp;hankering after stage effect, while it saved him from dulness, often&nbsp;betrayed him into rough exaggeration, especially in his comic scenes.&nbsp;But the gravest defect in his work is a defect of temper. His view&nbsp;of human life, especially of the life of women, is harsh, almost&nbsp;brutal</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> his knowledge of frailties and vices is obtruded with repellent force ; and he cannot, with all his skill and power as a storyteller, be numbered among the great artists who warm the heart&nbsp;and help to improve the conduct. But as a moral satirist and&nbsp;castigator, which was the function he professed over and above that&nbsp;of a story-teller, he undoubtedly did good service, both indirectly&nbsp;in his novels and directly in his own name.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(W.
