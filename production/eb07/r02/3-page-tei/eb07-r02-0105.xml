His best novel is usually considered to be the <hi rend="italic">Paysan Perverti,</hi>  which appeared inl776∙</p><p>Two writers may be pointed out, however, about this period, who were the representatives, if not of better taste, at least of better feelings.</p><p>Bernardin de St. Pierre (1737—1814) may be regarded as the connecting linkbetween the eighteenth and the nineteenth century : a graft of Fenelon upon Rousseau. His pathos no doubt often merges in a weakly sentimentalism ; but the calm idyllic beauty of the <hi rend="italic">Paul and Virginia</hi>  and the <hi rend="italic">Indian Cottage</hi>  (1789—1792) was not without its use in restoring to French literature a feeling for nature and its simple enjoyments, and the acknowledgment of a Providence, a belief which both philosophy and fiction had for some time past been labouring to obliterate.</p><p>The defects of St. Pierre, with very little of his redeeming excellencies, appear in the <hi rend="italic">Atala, Rene,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Natchez</hi>  of Chateaubriand. He is, no doubt, in some departments an original thinker, and a man of a poetical imagination, though a degree of vagueness and mysticism mingles even with the best of his works ; but as a novelist, his sickly sentiment and exaggeration of feeling are fatal to his success.</p><p>When the limbo of the Revolution, after its billowy heaving, began to settle again into something like a calm, under the despotism of the Consulate, the novel took the direction of broad and extravagant humour, derived from the gaieties and vulgaritiesof middle life,and,as might naturally be expected, liberally sprinkled with indecency, in the voluminous novels of Pigault Le Brun,—to whom it w*ould be unfair to deny considerable powers of broad mirth, and a fertility in imaginary burlesque situations, which remind us of Smollett. But the questionable character of the novel-writing of this period is not universal. In the tales of Madame Cottin, the authoress of <hi rend="italic">Elizabeth</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Mathilde,</hi>  a pure morality, and feminine tenderness, reappear ; and though those of Madame de Staël, with all their eloquence, occasionally inculcate more doubtful lessons, her genuine admiration for pure and elevated feeling, prevents her from willingly lending her talents to the palliation of vice. The novels of Madame de Staël, however, are far more German in their character than French.</p><p>The works of the literary veteran, Nodier, certainly owe their attractions more to the charms of a beautiful style than to theirsubstance. Throughout his whole course he has been but an imitator, putting on successively the manner of other writers. The <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi>  of’Goethe appears to have first given the tone to his novels, and the passionate energy and wild complaints of the German suicide were reproduced in his tale of <hi rend="italic">Therese Aubert.</hi>  To the influence of Goethe succeeded that of Byron, and the spirit of the <hi rend="italic">Corsair</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Lara</hi>  were infused into the Bandit.∕cαra<hi rend="italic">Sbogαr.</hi>  From Byron he passed to Scott, whom he has imitated in his <hi rend="italic">Trilby, ou lelutiη d<hi rend="sup">,</hi>Ar-gail,</hi>  a production, the effect of which, though meant to be serious and pathetic, is unintentionally of the most comic kind, for the “ tricksy spirit” of Argyle in the hands of Nodier becomes one of the most absurd of supernatural conceptions. In his <hi rend="italic">Smarra</hi>  again, a Thessalian story in the manner of the sorceries and diableries in the Golden Ass of Apuleius, he seems to have been influenced by the German night pieces of the school of Hoffmann ; and he certainly succeeds almost as well as his German master, in producing a strange ephialtic effect by a cloud of misty murky phantoms, which pass before us as if in a feverish and uneasy dream.</p><p>With the restoration of the Bourbons, some degree of external decency, at least, distinguished the productions of the French press, though still the license which its novelists permitted to themselves in their comic works, and the extravagant and terrible cast of their more tragic stories, indicated at once a looseness of morality, and a coarseness of taste, which might, in some measure, have prepared the world for that strange and revolting spectacle which the literature of fiction has presented in France, since the Revolution of 1830. The manner of Pigault le Brun, was imitated and improved upon by Paul de Koch ; for, adopting his principle of drawing chiefly from middle life, and his love for the representation of comic mischances, he has thrown into the best of his novels, scenes of simple humour, of tenderness, and even of powerful passion, to which the novelist of the Revolution had made no pretensions. To sneer at him as a Parisian cockney, or as the romance writer of the Grisettes, is easy; but we are much mistaken if his tales, homely and even coarse as they may be, will not be read when the atrocities of Sue and Masson, and the delicate depravities of Balzac, are forgotten.</p><p>In the higher sphere of romance, we have, during the same period, the earlier productions of Victor Hugo, <hi rend="italic">Hans of Iceland,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Bug Jargal. Hans of Iceland,</hi>  wild and extravagant as it is, is evidently not the work of an ordinary writer. A stern, savage northern spirit is breathed into the romance. Spiagudry, Orugix, even the monster from whom the tale derives its name, strange and ghastly creations as they are, exercise a certain fascination over the mind ; and the youthful poet has turned to great account the dreary wilds, gloomy lakes, stormy seas, and ruined fortresses of Scandinavia. <hi rend="italic">Bug Jargal</hi>  was decidedly inferior to <hi rend="italic">Hans of Iceland.</hi>  The essential improbability in the character of a negro passionately in love with a white woman, and yet tempering the wildest passion with the deepest respect, is obvious ; nor is that improbability disguised by the art with which Hugo has framed his story. There was more of genius, we think, in his <hi rend="italic">Dernier Jour d’un Condamné,</hi>  in which Hugo, like Sterne, has taken a single captive, shut him up in his dungeon, and then “ looked through the twilight of the grated door to take his picture.” In this little work he has shown how a profound interest might be given to a mere register of sensations, and a dramatic movement imparted to a monologue, in which the scene shifts only from the Bicètre to the Conciergerie, the Hotel de Ville, and the Place de Grève. Hugo’s great novel, <hi rend="italic">Notre Dame de Paris,</hi>  appeared in 1831. It is needless to speak of a work which has been more than once translated into English; and the characteristics of which, the mingled genius and extravagance, the poetical spirit in which it is conceived, and the want of nature in the characters which it pourtrays, resembling distorted and hideous masques rather than men, are now very generally and correctly appreciated.</p><p>The popularity of the romances of Scott led about the same time to a multitude of imitations, by Jacob and others, of which the <hi rend="italic">Cinq Mars</hi>  of Alfred de Vigny appears to be generally considered the most successful.</p><p>We have no idea of entering on that mass of revolting performances, equally offensive to good morals and good taste, with which the French press has teemed since 1830; and which we are but too happy to consider, with the French themselves, as a literature of transition. This school of blood and voluptuousness, funereal horrors and drunken orgies, the transitions in which remind one of the stage arrangement in the Rehearsal,—“ the coffin opens, and a banquet is discovered,”—we feel assured, can be of no long duration ; and already we believe, that the French public begin to feel that they have had enough of the endless Balzac, and Janin, and Sue, and Soulie, and Masson, and the other labourers in this Montfaucon of fiction. As for Madame du Devant, or George Sand,—the Chevalier d’Eon of French literature,—a being whose sex it would be impossible to ascertain from her works, with the warm passions and headlong eloquence of the woman, and the audacious speculation of the man ;—while the principles which she labours to inculcate, are of the most odious na-</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
