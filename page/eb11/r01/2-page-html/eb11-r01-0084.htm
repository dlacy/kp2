The standard of comparison&nbsp;generally adopted for this purpose is obtained by calculating&nbsp;the efficiency of an engine working according to the Rankine&nbsp;cycle. That is to say, expansion is adiabatic and is continued&nbsp;down to the back pressure which in a non-condensing engine&nbsp;is 14·7 ℔ per square inch, since any back pressure above this&nbsp;amount is an imperfection which belongs to the actual engine.&nbsp;The back pressure is supposed to be uniform, and there is no&nbsp;compression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fig. 21 shows the pressure-volume diagram of the Rankine cycle for one pound of steam where the initial pressure is 175 ℔ per&nbsp;square inch by the&nbsp;gauge, equivalent&nbsp;to 190 ℔ per square&nbsp;inch absolute. In&nbsp;no case could an&nbsp;engine receiving&nbsp;steam at the tem-perature corre-sponding to this&nbsp;pressure and reject-ing heat at 212° F.&nbsp;convert more heat&nbsp;into work than is&nbsp;represented by the area of this diagram. The area of the diagram&nbsp;may be measured, but it is usually more convenient to calculate the&nbsp;number of B. Th. U. which the area represents from the following&nbsp;formula, which is expressed in terms of the absolute temperature Τ<sub>1</sub>&nbsp;of the steam at the steam-pipe, and the temperature T<sub>2</sub>=461<sup>o</sup>+212<sup>o</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font1">With the initial pressure of 190 ℔ per square inch absolute it will be found from a steam table that T<sub>l</sub>=838° absolute. Using this and&nbsp;the temperature 673° in the expression, · it will be found that&nbsp;U = 185 B. Th. U. per pound of steam.

<p><span class="font1">185∕1013 = 0∙183.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">That is to say, a perfect engine working between the limits of temperature assigned would convert only 18% of the total heat&nbsp;supply into work. This would be an ideal performance for an&nbsp;engine receiving steam at 190 ℔ initial pressure absolute, and rejecting steam at the back pressure assumed above, and could never be&nbsp;attained in practice. When the initial pressure is 100 lb per square&nbsp;inch by the gauge the thermal efficiency drops to about nearly 15%&nbsp;with the same back pressure. The way the thermal efficiency of&nbsp;the ideal engine increases with the pressure is exhibited in fig. 22 by&nbsp;the curve AB. The curve was drawn by calculating the thermal&nbsp;efficiency from the above expression for various values of the&nbsp;initial temperature, keeping the final temperature constant at&nbsp;673<sup>o</sup>, and then plotting these efficiencies against the corresponding&nbsp;values of the gauge pressures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"> The actual thermal efficiencies observed in some of the cases cited in Table XXL are plotted on the diagram, the reference&nbsp;numbers on which refer to the first column in the table. Thus the </span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1">the pressure in the steam-pipe being 167 ℔ per square inch. From the diagram it will be seen that the corresponding efficiency of the ideal&nbsp;engine is about 0∙18. The efficiency ratio is therefore 0∙11∕0∙18 = 0∙61.&nbsp;That is to say, the engine actually utilized 61 % of the energy which&nbsp;it was possible to utilize by means of a perfect engine working with&nbsp;the same initial pressure against a back pressure equal to the&nbsp;atmosphere. Lines representing efficiency ratios of 0∙6, 0∙5 and&nbsp;o∙4 are plotted on the diagram, so that the efficiency ratios corre-sponding to the various experiments plotted may be readily read&nbsp;off. The initial temperature of the standard engine of comparison&nbsp;must be the temperature of the steam taken in the steam-pipe.&nbsp;For further information regarding the standard engine of comparison&nbsp;see the article Steam Engine and also the “ Report of the Committee&nbsp;on the Thermal Efficiency of Steam Engines, ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ProcHnst.

<p><span class="font2">§ 17. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Compound Locomotives. —</span><span class="font2">The thermal efficiency of a steam-engine is in general increased by carrying out the&nbsp;expansion of the steam in two, three or even more stages&nbsp;in separate cylinders, notwithstanding the inevitable drop of&nbsp;pressure which must occur when the steam is transferred from&nbsp;one cylinder to the other during the process of expansion.&nbsp;Compound working permits of a greater range of expansion&nbsp;than is possible with a simple engine, and incidentally there&nbsp;is less range of pressure per cylinder, so that the pressures&nbsp;and temperatures per cylinder have not such a wide range&nbsp;of variation. In compound working the combined volumes&nbsp;of the low-pressure cylinders is a measure of the power of&nbsp;the engine, since this represents the final volume of the steam&nbsp;used per stroke. The volume of the high-pressure cylinder&nbsp;may be varied within wide limits for the same low-pressure&nbsp;volume; the proportions adopted should, however, be such&nbsp;that there is an absence of excessive drop between them as&nbsp;the steam is transferred from one to the other. Compound&nbsp;locomotives have been built by various designers, but opinion&nbsp;is still uncertain whether any commercial economy is obtained&nbsp;by their use. The varying load against which a locomotive&nbsp;works, and the fact that a locomotive is non-condensing, are&nbsp;factors which reduce the margin of possible economy within&nbsp;narrow limits. Coal-saving can be shown to the extent of&nbsp;about 14% in some cases, but the saving depends upon the&nbsp;kind of service on which the engine is employed. The first true&nbsp;compound locomotive was constructed in 1876 from designs&nbsp;by A. M. Mallet, at the Creusot works in Bayonne. The first&nbsp;true compound locomotive in England was constructed at&nbsp;Crewe works in 1878 by F. W. Webb. It was of the same&nbsp;type as Mallet’s engine, and was made by simply bushing one&nbsp;cylinder of an ordinary two-cylinder simple engine, the bushed&nbsp;cylinder being the high-pressure and the other cylinder the&nbsp;low-pressure cylinder. Webb evolved the type of three-cylinder compound with which his name is associated in 1882.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
