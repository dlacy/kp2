<p><span class="font2">begin the reckoning from Julius Caesar or Augustus, we can include or exclude Galba, Otho and Vitellius, and, finally, when&nbsp;we have drawn our conclusions from these data, there remains&nbsp;the possibility that the book was after all not written under&nbsp;the sixth ëmperor, but was really a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vaticinium ex eventu.</span><span class="font2"> According to the different methods pursued, some have concluded&nbsp;that Nero was the sixth emperor, and thus dated thc Apocalypse&nbsp;before </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 70; others Vespasian, and yet others Domitian.&nbsp;No solution of the difficulties of the chapter is wholly satisfactory, but the best yet offered seems to be that of Bousset&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Offenbarung<sup>2</sup>,</span><span class="font2"> 410-18). He holds that 1-7, 9-1 r, 15-18,&nbsp;belong to an original source, which was written in the reign of&nbsp;Vespasian and represents the earlier stage of the Neronic myth.&nbsp;To a reviser in Domitian’s reign we owe 8,12-14 and 6b, a clause&nbsp;in 9, έτττα </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">$ρη... αυτών,</span><span class="font2"> and another in n, δ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ήν</span><span class="font2"> καί ούκ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ϊσην.</span><span class="font2"> If&nbsp;the clause καί </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ck </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">του αίματος των μαρτύρων</span><span class="font2"> Ίησου in 6 is an addition,&nbsp;then he thinks the source was Jewish and the “ blood of the&nbsp;saints ” was that shed at the destruction of Jerusalem, and the&nbsp;forecast of the author related to the destruction of Rome.&nbsp;When the reviser recast the passage it dealt not with the&nbsp;destruction of Jerusalem, but with the persecution of the&nbsp;Christians. Nero was now a demonic monster from the abyss,&nbsp;and the ten kings no longer Parthians but ghostly helpers of&nbsp;Nero. The destruction of Rome has now<sup>T</sup> become a secondary&nbsp;event: the reviser’s thought is fixed on the final strife between&nbsp;the Lamb and the Antichrist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xviii.-xix. 10.—</span><span class="font2">This section describes in prophetic language borrowed almost wholly from Isaiah and Jeremiah the coming&nbsp;judgment of Rome, and gives the ten lamentations of the kings&nbsp;and the merchants and thc seamen over her, and the thanksgivings in heaven for her overthrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xix. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11-21.—</span><span class="font2">The victory of the warrior Messiah over the two&nbsp;beasts, the Roman Empire and the imperial cultus and the&nbsp;kings of the earth. Many of the ideas set forth in earlier&nbsp;chapters here coalesce and find their consummation. The&nbsp;Messiah, whose birth and escape from the dragon was recounted&nbsp;in xii. 5, and who was to rule the nations with a rod of iron, at&nbsp;last appears in discharge of His office. The beast and the false&nbsp;prophet who arc described in xiii. are cast alive into the lake&nbsp;of fire, and the kings of the earth who had assembled for this&nbsp;conflict, xvi. 14, xvii. 14, were slain by the sword of Him that&nbsp;sat on the horse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The conception of the Messiah may be Jewish: at all events it is not distinctively Christian. The title &quot; Word of God ”&nbsp;can hardly be said to establish any connexion with the prologue&nbsp;of the Fourth Gospel; for the conceptions of the Messiah in&nbsp;that Gospel and in these chapters belong to different worlds&nbsp;of thought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It is to be observed that our author follows the apocalyptic scheme of two judgments which is first attested about 100 </span><span class="font0">B.c.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The first judgment precedes the establishment of the temporary&nbsp;Messianic kingdom, as here in xix. 19-21; and the final judgment follows at its close, as here in xx. 7-10.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xx. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-6.—</span><span class="font2">The millennium, or the period between the first&nbsp;and final judgments, when Christ, with His chosen, reigns and&nbsp;Satan is imprisoned. Rome has been overthrown, but, as&nbsp;Rome is only the last secular manifestation of Satan, there is yet&nbsp;the final struggle with Satan and his adherents. But the time&nbsp;for this struggle has not yet arrived. Satan is bound@@<sup>1</sup> and cast&nbsp;into the abyss, and the kingdom of Christ and of the martyrs&nbsp;and faithful confessors established for a thousand years. Thus&nbsp;it is shown that evil will be finally overcome; for that the true&nbsp;and ultimate power even in this world belongs to Christ and&nbsp;those that are His.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The main features of this section have been borrowed from Judaism. The Messianic kingdom was originally conceived of&nbsp;as of everlasting duration on the present earth, but about 100 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">this idea was abandoned and the hopes of the faithful were&nbsp;directed to a temporary earthly kingdom of 400 or 1000 years&nbsp;or of indefinite duration (see R. H. Charles, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Critical History of&nbsp;the Doctrine of a Future Life,</span><span class="font2"> pp. 201-4, 261, 286, 288). Moreover, the expectation that the saints would rise to share in the&nbsp;blessedness of this kingdom is also found in Judaism, 4 Ezra&nbsp;vii. 28 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(op. cit.</span><span class="font2"> p. 285).</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup>This idea appears as early as the 2nd century B.c. Cf. Test. Levi xviii. 12.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xx. ?~io.—</span><span class="font2">Release of Satan and final assault on the city of God by the hosts of Gog and Magog at the instance of Satan.&nbsp;Satan and the beasts condemned to eternal torment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xx. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;11-14.—</span><span class="font2">The Final Resurrection and Judgment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xxi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1-8.—</span><span class="font2">The new heavens and the new earth. The language&nbsp;in this and the following section is highly figurative; but as&nbsp;Porter has well remarked: <sup>44</sup>Figurative language is the only&nbsp;language in which we can express our hope of heaven, and no&nbsp;figures can have greater power to suggest this hope than those&nbsp;taken from the literal longings of exiled Israel for the recovery&nbsp;of its land and city.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xxi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9-xxii.</span><span class="font2"> 5.—The vision of the New Jerusalem. There&nbsp;are several grounds for regarding this section as an independent&nbsp;source possibly of Jewish origin and subsequently submitted to a&nbsp;Christian revision. This view is taken by Vischer, Weyland,&nbsp;Spitta, Sabatier, J. Weiss, Boussct and others. Our author&nbsp;has incorporated it as describing the consummation of the&nbsp;prevision contained in xi. 15-18, in which he foresaw the time&nbsp;when the kingdom of the world would become the kingdom of&nbsp;our Lord and of His Christ, and the saints should enter on their&nbsp;reward. Moreover, he has already hinted at its contents in&nbsp;xix. 7 and xxi. 2, where he speaks of the church as a bride and the&nbsp;marriage supper of the Lamb. But the section betrays inconsistent conceptions. The standpoint of the heavenly Jerusalem&nbsp;is abandoned in xxi. 24-27. xxii. 2, and the context implies an&nbsp;earthly Jerusalem to which the Gentiles go up as pilgrims.&nbsp;Outside the gates of this city are unclean and abominable things.&nbsp;These inconsistencies are best explained by the hypothesis that&nbsp;our author was drawing upon a literary fixed tradition. The&nbsp;doublets in xxi. 23 and xxii. 5b, in xxi. 25 and xxii. 5a, and&nbsp;in xxi. 27 and xxii. 3, point in the same direction. Various&nbsp;additions were introduced, according to Bousset, by the last&nbsp;redactor, such as the frequently recurring reference to the&nbsp;Lamb, xxi. 9, 22, 23, 27, xxii. 1,3. In xxii. 3 the fact that the&nbsp;words <sup>44</sup> of thc Lamb ” are an addition is clear from the context;&nbsp;for, after the clause <sup>44</sup> the throne of God and of the Lamb shall&nbsp;be therein ” the singular follows, <sup>44</sup> His servants shall do Him&nbsp;service.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">xxii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6-21.—</span><span class="font2">The conclusion. The promises are sure, the&nbsp;end is near and the judgment at hand. The words of the book&nbsp;are the message of Christ Himself and are inviolable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unity.—</span><span class="font2">From the preceding sections it follows that we cannot ascribe a strict literary unity to the book. The book&nbsp;is most probably the work of a single author, but it was not&nbsp;written wholly at one date, nor have all the parts come directly&nbsp;from one brain. We have several good grounds, for regarding&nbsp;vii. 1-8, xi. r-13, xii., xiii., xvii., as wholly or in part independent&nbsp;sources, which our author has laid under contribution and&nbsp;adapted more or less adequately to his purpose. He appears to&nbsp;have taken over with but slight modification xx. and xxi.&nbsp;9-xxii. 5. Furthermore, while certain fragments such as xi. 1-2&nbsp;presuppose a date anterior to </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font2"> 70, others, as xvi. 12 and&nbsp;xvii. 12, require a date not later than Vespasian’s time;&nbsp;other parts of xvii. postulate a Vespasianic date as the earliest&nbsp;admissible, and, finally, the composition of the book in its&nbsp;present form cannot be placed before the closing years of&nbsp;Domitian. But to this question we shall return presently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Nevertheless, the book exhibits a relative unity; for, whatever digressions occur in the development of its theme, the main&nbsp;object of the writer is never lost sight of. This relative unity&nbsp;is manifested also in the uniform character of the language, a&nbsp;uniformity, however, which is occasionally conspicuous by its&nbsp;absence in the case of independent sources, as in xi. 1-13. The&nbsp;author or the final redactor has impressed a certain linguistic&nbsp;character on the book, which differentiates it not only from all&nbsp;secular writings of the time, but also from all the New Testament books, including the Johannine. And yet the Apocabmse&nbsp;shows in many of its phrases an undoubted affinity to the latter—</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
