a Phenician philoſopher and hiſtorian, who is ſaid to have flouriſhed before the Trojan war about the time of Semiramis. Of this moſt ancient writer, the only remains extant are ſundry fragments of coſmogony, and of the hiſtory of the gods and firſt mortals, preſerved by Euſebius and Theodoret; both of whom ſpeak of Sancho niatho as an accurate and faithful hiſtorian; and the former adds, that his work, which was tranſlated by Philo-Byblitis from the Phenician into the Greek language, contains many things relating to the hiſtory of the Jews which deferve great credit, both becauſe they agree with the Jewiſh writers, and becauſe the author received theſe particulars from the annals of Hierombalus, a prieſt of the god Jao.</p><p>Several modern writers, however, of great learning, have called in queſtion the very exiſtence of Sanchoniatho, and have contended with much plauſibility, that the fragments which Euſebius adopted as genuine upon the authority of Porphyry, were forged by that author, or the pretended tranſlator Philo, from enmity to the Chriſtians, and that the Pagans might have ſomething to ſhow of equal antiquity with the books of Moſes. Theſe oppoſite opinions have produced a controversy that has filled volumes, and of which our limits would hardly admit of an abſtract. We ſhall therefore in few words ſtate what to us appears to be the truth, and refer ſuch of our readers as are deſirous of fuller information to the works of the authors<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> Bochart, Scaliger, Voſſius, Cumberland, Dodwell, Stillingfleet, Moſheim’s Cudworth, and Warburton.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> mentioned at the bottom of the page.</p><p>The controverſy reſpecting Sanchoniatho reſolves itſelf into two queſtions: 1. Was there in reality ſuch a writer? 2. Was he of the very remote antiquity which his tranſlator claims for him?</p><p>That there was really ſuch a writer, and that the fragments preſerved by Euſebius are indeed parts of his hiſtory interpolated perhaps by the tranſlator<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b</hi>) Of this there are indeed ſeveral proofs. Philo makes Sanchoniatho ſpeak of <hi rend="italic">Byblus</hi> as the moſt ancient</p><p>city of Phenicia, which, in all probability, it was not. We read in the book of Judges of <hi rend="italic">Berith</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Berytus,</hi> the city where Sanchoniatho himſelf lived; but not of Byblus, which was the native city of Philo, and to which he is therefore partial. He makes him likewiſe talk of the Greeks at a period long before any of the Grecian ſtates were known or probably peopled.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(b),</hi> we are compelled to believe by the following reaſons. Euſebius, who admitted them into his work as authentic, was one of the moſt learned men of his age, and a diligent ſearcher into antiquity. His conduct at the Nicene council ſhows, that on every ſubject he thought for himſelf, neither biaſſed by authority to the one fide, nor carried over by the rage of innovation to the other. He had better means than any modern writer can have of ſatisfying himſelf with reſpect to the authenticity of a very extraordinary work, which had then but lately<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0648.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0642"/>
been tranſlated into the Greek language, and made generally known; and there is nothing in the work itſelf, or at leaſt in thoſe parts of it which he has preſerved, that could induce a wife and good man to obtrude it upon the public as genuine, had he himſelf ſuſpected it to be ſpurious. Too many of the Chriſtian fathers were indeed very credulous, and ready to admit the authenticity of writings without duly weighing the merits of their claim; but then ſuch writings were always believed to be favourable to the Chriſtian cauſe, and inimical to the cauſe of Paganiſm. That no man of common ſenſe could ſuppoſe the coſmogony of Sanchoniatho favourable to the cauſe of revealed religion, a farther proof cannot be requiſite than what is furniſhed by the following extract.</p><p>“He ſuppoſeth, or affirms, that the principles of the univerſe was a dark and windy air, or a wind made of dark air, and a turbulent evening <hi rend="italic">chaos;</hi> and that theſe things were boundleſs, and for a long time had no bound or figure. But when this wind fell in love with his own principles, and a mixture was made, that mixture was called <hi rend="italic">deſire</hi> or <hi rend="italic">cupid (ποϐος).</hi></p><p>“This mixture completed, was the beginning of the (χτισεως) making of all things. But that wind did not know its own production; and of this, with that wind, was begotten <hi rend="italic">Mot,</hi> which ſome call <hi rend="italic">Mud,</hi> others the putrefaction of a watery mixture. And of this came all the ſeed of this building, and the generation of the univerſe.</p><p>“But there were certain animals, which had no ſenſe, out of which were begotten intelligent animals, and were called <hi rend="italic">Zopheſemin,</hi> that is, the ſpies or overſeers of Heaven; and were formed alike in the ſhape of an egg. Thus ſhone out <hi rend="italic">Mot,</hi> the fun and the moon, the leſs and the greater ſtars.</p><p>“And the air ſhining thoroughly with light, by its fiery influence on the ſea and earth, winds were begotten, and clouds and great defluxions of the heavenly waters. And when all theſe things firſt were parted, and were ſeparated from their proper place by the heat of the ſun, and then all met again in the air, and daſhed againſt one another, and were ſo broken to pieces; whence thunders and lightenings were made: and at the ſtroke of theſe thunders the fore-mentioned intelligent animals were awakened, and frighted with the found; and male and female ſtirred in the earth and in the ſea: This is their generation of animals.</p><p>“After theſe things our author (Sanchoniatho) goes on ſaying: Theſe things are written in the <hi rend="italic">Coſmogony</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Taautus,</hi> and in his memoirs; and out of the conjectures, and ſurer natural ſigns which his mind ſaw, and found out, and wherewith he hath enlightened us.</p><p>“Afterwards declaring the names of the winds, <hi rend="italic">north and ſouth</hi> and the reft, he makes this epilogue. 'But theſe firſt men conſecrated the plants ſhooting out of the earth, and judged them gods, and worſhipped them; upon whom they themſelves lived, and all their poſterity and all before them: to theſe they made their meat and drink offerings. ’ Then he concludes: "theſe were the devices of worſhip agreeing with the weakneſs and want of boldneſs in their minds.”</p><p>Let us ſuppoſe Euſebius to have been as weak and credulous as the darkeſt monk in the darkeſt age of Europe, a ſuppoſition which no man will make who knows any thing of the writings of that eminent hiſto</p><p>rian; what could he fee in this ſenſeleſs jargon, which even a dreaming monk would think of employing in ſupport of Chriſtianity? Euſebius calls it, and calls it truly, direct atheiſm; but could he imagine that an ancient ſyſtem of atheiſm would contribute ſo much to make the Pagans of his age admit as divine revelations the books of the Old and New Teſtaments, that he ſhould be induced to adopt, without examination, an impudent forgery not 200 years old as genuine remains of the moſt remote antiquity?</p><p>If this Phenician coſmogony be a fabrication of Porphyry, or of the pretended tranſlator, it muſt ſurely have been fabricated for ſome purpoſe; but it is impoſſible for us to conceive what purpoſe either of theſe writers could have intended to ſerve by forging a ſyſtem ſo extravagantly abſurd. Porphyry, though an enemy to the Chriſtians, was not an atheiſt, and would never have thought of making an atheiſt of him whom he meant to obtrude upon the world as the rival of Moſes. His own principles were thoſe of the Alexandrian Platoniſts; and had he been the forger of the works which bear the name of Sanchoniatho, inſtead of the incomprehenſible jargon about <hi rend="italic">dark wind, evening chaos, Mot,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">overſeers oſ heaven in the ſhape oſ an egg,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">animation proceeding from the found oſ thunder,</hi> we ſhould doubtleſs have been amuſed with refined ſpeculations concerning the operations of the <hi rend="italic">Demiurgus</hi> and the other perſons in the Platonic Triad. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Platonism</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Porphyry.</hi></p><p>Father Simon of the oratory imagines<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">*</hi> Bib. Cri. <hi rend="italic">vol. i. p. 140.</hi></p></note> * that the purpoſe for which the hiſtory of Sanchoniatho was forged, was to ſupport Paganiſm, by taking from it its mythology and allegories, which were perpetually objected to it by the Chriſtian writers; but this learned man totally miſtakes the matter. The primitive Chriſtians were too much attached to allegories themſelves to reſt their objections to Paganiſm on ſuch a foundation: what they objected to that ſyſtem was the immoral ſtories told of the gods. To this the Pagan prieſts and philoſophers replied, that theſe ſtories were only <hi rend="italic">mythologic allegories,</hi> which veiled all the great truths of Theology, Ethics, and Phyſics. The Chriſtians ſaid, this could not be; for that the ſtories of the gods had a ſubſtantial foundation in fact, theſe gods being only dead men deified, who, in life, had like paſſions and infirmities with other mortals. This then was the objection which the forger of the works of Sanchoniatho had to remove, if he really forged them in ſupport of Paganiſm; but, inſtead of doing ſo, he gives the genealogy and hiſtory of all the greater gods, and ſhows, that they were men deified after death for the exploits, ſome of them groſsly immoral, which they had performed in this world. We have elſewhere <hi rend="smallcaps">(Polytheism,</hi> n⁰ 17.) given his account of the deification of <hi rend="italic">Chryſor,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ouranos,</hi> and Ge, and <hi rend="italic">Hypſiſtos,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Muth;</hi> but our readers may not perhaps be ill pleaſed to accompany him through the hiſtory of <hi rend="italic">Ouranos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cronus,</hi> two of his greateſt gods; whence it will appear how little his writings are calculated to ſupport the tottering cauſe of Paganiſm againſt the objections which were then urged to it by the Chriſtian apologiſts.</p><p>“Ouranos (ſays he), taking the kingdom of his father, married Ge his ſiſter, and by her had four ſons; <hi rend="italic">Ilus,</hi> who is called <hi rend="italic">Cronus; Betylus; Dagon,</hi> who is <hi rend="italic">Siton, or</hi> the <hi rend="italic">god oſ corn;</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Atlas.</hi> But by other wives<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0649.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0643"/>
Ouranos had much issue, wherefore Ge being grieved at it and jealous, reproached Ouranos, ſo as they parted from each other. But Ouranos, though he parted from her, yet by force invading her, and lying with her when he liſted, went away again; and he alſo attempted to kill the children he had by her. Ge alſo often defended or avenged herſelf, gathering auxiliary powers unto her. But when Cronus came to man’s age, uſing Hermes' Trismegistus as his counſellor and aſſiſtant (for he was his ſecretary), he oppoſed his father Ouranos, avenging his mother. But Cronus had children, Perſephone and Athena; the former died a virgin, but by the counſel of the latter Athena, and of Hermes, Cronus made of iron a ſcimitar and a ſpear. Then Hermes, ſpeaking to the aſſiſtants of Cronus with enchanting words, wrought in them a keen deſire to fight againſt Ouranos in the behalf of Ge; and thus Cronus warring againſt Ouranos, drove him out of his kingdom, and ſucceeded in the imperial power or office. In the ſight was taken a well-beloved concubine of Ouranos big with child. Cronus gave her in marriage to Dagon, and ſhe brought forth at his houſe what ſhe had in her womb by Ouranos, and called him <hi rend="italic">Demaroon.</hi> After theſe things Cronus builds a wall round about his houſe, and founds <hi rend="italic">Byblus</hi> the firſt city in Phenicia. Afterwards Cronus, ſuſpecting his own brother Atlus, with the advice of Hermes, throwing him into a deep hole of the earth, there buried him, and having a ſon called <hi rend="italic">Sαdid,</hi> he diſpatched him with his own ſword, having a ſuſpicion of him, and deprived his own ſon of life with his own hand. He alſo cut off the head of his own daughter, ſo that all the gods were amazed at the mind of Cronus. But in proceſs of time, Ouranos being in flight, or baniſhment, ſends his daughter Aſtarte, with two other ſiſters Rhea and Dione, to cut off Cronus by deceit, whom Cronus taking, made wives of theſe ſiſters. Ouranos, underſtanding this, ſent Eimarmene and Hore, Fate and Beauty, with other auxiliaries, to war againſt him: but Cronus, having gained the affections of theſe alſo, kept them with himſelf. Moreover, the god Ouranos deviſed <hi rend="italic">Baetulia,</hi> contriving ſtones that moved as having life. But Cronus begat on Aſtarte ſeven daughters called <hi rend="italic">Titanides</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Artemides;</hi> and he begat on Rhea ſeven ſons, the youngeſt of whom, as ſoon as he was born, was conſecrated a god. Alſo by Dione he had daughters, and by Aſtarte moreover two fons, <hi rend="italic">Pathos</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Eros,</hi> i. e. Cupid and Love. But Dagon, after he had found out bread, corn, and the plough, was called <hi rend="italic">Zeus Arotrius.</hi> To <hi rend="italic">Sydyc,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the juſt,</hi> one of the <hi rend="italic">Titanides</hi> bare <hi rend="italic">Aſclepius.</hi> Cronus had alſo in <hi rend="italic">Peraea</hi> three ſons, I. <hi rend="italic">Cronus</hi> his father’s nameſake. 2. <hi rend="italic">Zeus Belus.</hi> 3. <hi rend="italic">Apollo”</hi></p><p>Is it conceivable, that a writer ſo acute as Porphyry, or indeed that any man of common ſenſe either in his age or in that of Philo, would forge a book filled with ſuch ſtories as theſe, in order to remove the Chriſtian objections to the immoral characters of the Pagan divinities? The very ſuppoſition is impoſſible to be made. Nor let any one imagine that Sanchoniatho is here writing allegorically, and by his tales of <hi rend="italic">Ouranos,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Ge,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Cronus,</hi> is only perſonifying the <hi rend="italic">heaven,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">earth,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">time.</hi> On the contrary, he aſſures us, that <hi rend="italic">Ouranos,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Epigeus,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Autochthon</hi> (for he gives him all theſe names), was the ſon of one <hi rend="italic">Eliaun</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hypſiſtos,</hi> who dwelt about Byblus, and that from him the ele</p><p>ment which is over us was called <hi rend="italic">heaven,</hi> on account of its excellent beauty, as the earth was named <hi rend="italic">Ge</hi> after his fiſter and wife. And his tranſlalor is very angry<note anchored="true" n="4" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"></hi> * Apud Euseb. Praep, Evang. <hi rend="italic">lib. I. cap. 6.</hi></p></note> * with the Neotoric Greeks, as he calls them, becauſe that, "by a great deal of force and ſtraining, they laboured to turn all the ſtories of the gods into allegories and phyſical diſcourſes.” This proves unanſwerably, that the author of this book, whoever he was, did not mean to veil the great truths of religion under the cloak of mythologie allegories; and therefore, if it was forged by Porphyry in ſupport of Paganiſm, the forger ſo far miſtook the ſtate of the queſtion between him and his adverſaries, that he contrived a book, which, if admitted to be ancient, totally overthrew his own cauſe, The next thing to be inquired into with repect to Sanchoniatho is his antiquity. Did he really live and write at ſo early a period as Porphyry and Philo pretend? We think he did not; and what contributes not a little to confirm us in our opinion, is that mark of national vanity and partiality, common to after-times, in making the ſacred myſteries of his own country original, and conveyed from Phenicia into Egypt. This, however, furniſhes an aditional proof that Porphyry was not the forger of the work; for he well knew that the myſteries had their origin in Egypt (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Mysteries),</hi> and would not have fallen into ſuch a blunder. He is guilty, indeed, of a very great anachroniſm, when he makes Sanchoniatho contemporary with Semiramis, and yet pretends that what he writes of the Jews is compiled from the records of Hierombalus the prieſt of the god Jao; for Bochart has made it appear in the higheſt degree probable<note anchored="true" n="5" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"></hi> † Geogr. Sair <hi rend="italic">p. 2. book 2, lib. 2. cap. 17.</hi></p></note> †, that <hi rend="italic">Hierombalus</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Jeromb-baal</hi> is the <hi rend="italic">Jerub-baal</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Gideon</hi> of ſcripture.</p><p>Between the reign of Semiramis and the Trojan war a period elapſed of near 800 years, whereas Gideon flouriſhed not above ſeventy years before the deſtruction of Troy. But ſuppoſing Sanchoniatho to have really conſulted the records of Gideon, it by no means follows that he flouriſhed at the fame period with that judge of Iſrael. He ſpeaks of the building of Tyre as an ancient thing, while our beſt chronologers<note anchored="false" n="6" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Scaliger.</hi></p></note> place it in the time of Gideon. Indeed, were we certain that any writings had been left by that holy man, we ſhould be obliged to conclude, that a large tract of time had intervened between the death of their author and their falling into the hands of Sanchoniatho; for, ſurely, they could not, in a ſhort period, have been ſo completely corrupted as to give any countenance to his impious abſurdities. His atheiſtic coſmogony he does not indeed pretend to have got from the annals of the prieſt of Jao, but from records which were depoſited in his own town of Berytus by Thoth a Phenician philoſopher, who was afterwards made king of Egypt. But ſurely the annals of Gideon, if written by himſelf, and preſerved pure to the days of Sanchoniatho, muſt have contained ſo many truths of the Moſaic religion, as muſt have prevented any man of ſenſe from adopting ſo impoſſible a theory as Thoth’s, though ſanctioned by the greateſt name of profane antiquity. Stillingfleet indeed thinks it moſt probable that Sancboniatho became acquainted with the moſt remarkable paſſages of the life of Jerub-baal from annals written by a Phenician pen. He obſerves, that immediately after the death of Gideon, the Iſraelites, with their uſual proneneſs to idolatry, worſhiped <hi rend="italic">Baal-berith,</hi> or the idol of Berytus<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0650.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0644"/>
the town in which Sanchoniatho lived; and from this circumſtance he concludes that there muſt have been ſuch an intercourſe between the Hebrews and Berytians, that in proceſs of time the latter people might aſſume to themſelves the Jerub-baal of the former, and hand down his actions to poſterity as thoſe of a prieſt inſtead of a great commander. All this may be true; but if ſo, it amounts to a demonſtration that the antiquity of Sanchoniatho is not ſo high by many ages as that which is claimed for him by Philo and Porphyry, though he may ſtill be more ancient, as we think Voſſius has proved him to be<note anchored="true" n="7" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic"></hi> * De Ηiſt. Grec <hi rend="italic">. lib. i. cap. i.</hi></p></note> *, than any other profane hiſtorian whoſe writings have come down to us either entire or in fragments.</p><p>But granting the authenticity of Sanchoniatho’s hiſtory, what, it may be aſked, is the value of his fragments, that we ſhould be at any trouble to aſcertain whether they be genuine remains of high antiquity, or the forgeries of a modern impoſtor? We anſwer, with the illuſtrous Stillingfleet, that though thoſe fragments contain ſuch abſurdſties as it would be a diſgrace to reaſon to ſuppoſe credible; though the whole coſmogony is the groſſeſt ſink of atheiſm; and though many perſons make a figure in the hiſtory, whoſe very exiſtence may well be doubted; yet we, who have in our hands the light of divine revelation, may in this dungeon diſcover many excellent relicks of ancient tradition, which throw no feeble light upon many paſſages of holy ſcripture, as they give us the origin and progreſs of that idolatry which was ſo long the opprobrium of human nature. They furniſh too a complete confutation of the extravagant chronology of the Chaldeans and Egyptians, and ſhow, if they be genuine, that the world is indeed not older than it is ſaid to be by Moſes.
