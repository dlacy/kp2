                <p><label>ROSKILDE</label> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Roeskilde,</hi> a town of Denmark
                    in the <hi rend="italic">amt</hi> (county) of Kjobenhavn (Copenhagen), 20 m. by
                    rail W. of Copenhagen, on the great lagoon-like inlet riamed Roskilde Fjord.
                    Pop. (1901) 8368. It has a small port, and is an important railway junction,
                    from which lines diverge W.,</p>
               <p>S.W. and S. through the island of Zealand. Its interest, however, is historical.
                    It was the capital of the kingdom until 1443, and the residence of the bishops
                    of Zealand until the Reformation. The cathedral, a beautiful church, was
                    consecrated in 1084, but of this early building only foundation walls remain;
                    the present structure of brick was begun in 1215, and
                    enlarged and restored at various later dates. It stands in relation to Danish
                    history somewhat as Westminster Abbey does to English, containing the tombs of
                    most of the Danish kings from Harold I. (987). The most noteworthy architectural
                    details are the Chapel of the Trinity (15th century) and that of Christian IV.
                    (Renaissance, 1617), carved choir-stalls, and an altar-piece of the 16th
                    century. Other old buildings are a church of Our Lady, dating as it stands from
                    1242, a diocesan library (partly of the 15th century), royal palace (1733) and
                    institute for daughters of noblemen (1670).</p>
