among the Romans, was a feaſt of a private nature, provided for the dead ſome time after the funeral. It conſiſted of beans, lettuces, bread, eggs, &amp; c. Theſe were laid upon the tomb, and they fooliſhly believed that the dead would come out for the repaſt. What was left was generally burnt on the ſtone. The <hi rend="italic">word silicernium</hi> is derived from si <hi rend="italic">lex</hi> and cae <hi rend="italic">na,</hi> i. e “a supper upon a ſtone.” Eating what had thus been provided for the dead, was eſteemed a mark of the moſt miſerable poverty. A ſimilar entertainment was made by the Greeks at the tombs of the deceaſed ; but it was uſual among them to treat the ghoſts with the fragments from the feaſt of the living.
