<p><label>RUTH</label>
a canonical book of the Old Testament, being âˆ£ a kind of appendage to the book of Judges, and an intro- : duction to those of Samuel, and having its title from the person whose story is there principally related. In this story are observable the ancient rights of kindred and redemption ; and the manner of buying the inheritance of the deceased, with other particulars of great note and antiquity. The canonicalness of this book was never disputed ; but the learned are not agreed about the epoch of the history which it relates. Ruth the Moabitcss is found in the genealogy of our Saviour. (Matt. i. 5.)</p>
