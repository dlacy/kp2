<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">manifest. It had recovered from the confusion consequent upon the dissolution of the ancient Roman empire. The Teutonic tribes had been Christianized, civilized, and&nbsp;assimilated to the previously Latinized races over whom&nbsp;they exercised the authority of conquerors. Comparative tranquillity and material comfort had succeeded&nbsp;to discord and rough living. Modern nationalities, defined&nbsp;as separate factors in a common system, were ready to&nbsp;cooperate upon the basis of European federation. The&nbsp;ideas of universal monarchy and of indivisible Christendom,&nbsp;incorporated in the Holy Roman Empire and the Roman&nbsp;Church, had so far lost their hold that scope was offered&nbsp;for the introduction of new theories both of state and church&nbsp;which would have seemed visionary or impious to the&nbsp;mediaeval mind. It is therefore obvious that some term,&nbsp;wider than Revival of Learning, descriptive of the change&nbsp;which began to pass over Europe in the 14th and 15th&nbsp;centuries, lias to be adopted. That of Renaissance,&nbsp;Rinascimento, or Renascence is sufficient for the purpose,&nbsp;though we have to guard against the tyranny of what is&nbsp;after all a metaphor. We must not suffer it to lead us&nbsp;into rhetoric about the deadness and the darkness of the&nbsp;Middle Ages, or hamper our inquiry with preconceived&nbsp;assumptions that the re-birth in question was in any true&nbsp;sense a return to the irrecoverable pagan past. Nor must&nbsp;we imagine that there was any abrupt break with the&nbsp;Middle Ages. On the contrary, the Renaissance was&nbsp;rather the last stage of the Middle Ages, emerging from&nbsp;ecclesiastical and feudal despotism, developing what was&nbsp;original in mediaeval ideas by the light of classic arts and&nbsp;letters, holding in itself the promise of the modern world.&nbsp;It was therefore a period and a process of transition,&nbsp;fusion, preparation, tentative endeavour. And just at&nbsp;this point the real importance of the revival of learning&nbsp;may be indicated. That rediscovery of the classic past&nbsp;restored the confidence in their own faculties to men&nbsp;striving after spiritual freedom; revealed the continuity&nbsp;of history and the identity of human nature in spite of&nbsp;diverse creeds and different customs; held up for emulation master-works of literature, philosophy, and art;&nbsp;provoked inquiry; encouraged criticism; shattered the&nbsp;narrow mental barriers imposed by mediaeval orthodoxy.&nbsp;Humanism, a word which will often recur in the ensuing&nbsp;paragraphs, denotes a specific bias which the forces&nbsp;liberated in the Renaissance took from contact with the&nbsp;ancient world,—the particular form assumed by human&nbsp;self-esteem at that epoch,—the ideal of life and civilization&nbsp;evolved by the modern nations. It indicates the endeavour&nbsp;of man to reconstitute himself as a free being, not as the&nbsp;thrall of theological despotism, and the peculiar assistance&nbsp;he derived in this effort from Greek and Roman literature,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">litter¿v humaniores,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> letters leaning rather to the side of&nbsp;man than of divinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">I It is now apparent in what sense the Renaissance has</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">־ to be treated in this article. It will be considered as implying a comprehensive movement of the European&nbsp;intellect and will toward self-emancipation, toward re-assertion of the natural rights of the reason and the&nbsp;senses, toward the conquest of this planet as a place of&nbsp;human occupation, and toward the formation of regulative theories both for states and individuals differing from&nbsp;those of mediaeval times. The revival of learning will be&nbsp;treated as a decisive factor in this process of evolution on&nbsp;a new plan. To exclude the Reformation and the Counter-Reformation wholly from the survey is impossible, as will&nbsp;appear more plainly in the sequel. These terms indicate&nbsp;moments in the whole process of modern history which&nbsp;were opposed, each to the other, and both to the Renaissance ; and it is needful to bear in mind that they have,&nbsp;scientifically speaking, a quite separate existence. Yet if&nbsp;the history of Europe in the 16th century of our era came to&nbsp;be written with the brevity with which we write the history&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Europe in the 6th century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c., </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it would be difficult at&nbsp;the distance of time implied by that supposition to distinguish the Italian movement of the Renaissance in its&nbsp;origin from the German movement of the Reformation.&nbsp;Both would be seen to have a common starting-point in the&nbsp;reaction against long dominant ideas which were becoming&nbsp;obsolete, and also in the excitation of faculties which had&nbsp;during the same period been accumulating energy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The Renaissance, if we try to regard it as a period, was essentially the transition from one historical stage to&nbsp;another. It cannot therefore be confined within strict&nbsp;chronological limits. This indecision inherent in the&nbsp;nature of a process which involved neither a political&nbsp;revolution nor the promulgation of a new religious creed,&nbsp;but was a gradual metamorphosis of the intellectual and&nbsp;moral state of Europe, is further augmented by the&nbsp;different epochs at which the several nations were prepared&nbsp;to bear their share in it. England, for example, was still&nbsp;feudal and mediaeval when Italy had socially and mentally&nbsp;entered on the modern stadium. A brother of the Black&nbsp;Prince banqueted with Petrarch in the palace of Galeazzo&nbsp;Visconti. That is to say, the founder of Italian humanism,&nbsp;the representative of Italian despotic state-craft, and the&nbsp;companion of Froissart’s heroes met together at a marriage&nbsp;feast. The memories which these names evoke prove how&nbsp;impossible it is to fix boundaries in time for a movement&nbsp;which in 1368 had reached nearly the same point in Italy&nbsp;as it afterwards attained at the close of the 16th century&nbsp;in England. The Renaissance must indeed be viewed&nbsp;mainly as an internal process whereby spiritual energies&nbsp;latent in the Middle Ages were developed into actuality&nbsp;and formed a mental habit for the modern world. The process began in Italy, and gradually extended to the utmost&nbsp;bounds of Europe, producing similar results in every nation,&nbsp;and establishing a common civilization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">There is one date, however, which may be remembered with advantage as the starting-point in time of the&nbsp;Renaissance, after the departure from the Middle Ages&nbsp;had been definitely and consciously made by the Italians.&nbsp;This is the year 1453, when Constantinople, chosen for&nbsp;his capital by the first Christian emperor of Rome, fell&nbsp;into the hands of the Turk. One of the survivals of the&nbsp;old world, the shadow of what had been the Eastern&nbsp;empire, now passed suddenly away. Almost at the same&nbsp;date that visionary revival of the Western empire, which&nbsp;had imposed for six centuries upon the imagination of&nbsp;mediaeval Europe, hampering Italy and impeding the&nbsp;consolidation of Germany, ceased to reckon among political&nbsp;actualities ; while its more robust rival, the Roman Church,&nbsp;seemed likely to sink into the rank of a petty Italian&nbsp;principality. Three lights of mediaeval Christendom, the&nbsp;Eastern empire, the Holy Roman empire, and the papacy,&nbsp;at this point of time severally suffered extinction, mortal&nbsp;enfeeblement, and profound internal transformation. It&nbsp;was demonstrated by the destruction of the Eastern and&nbsp;the dotage of the Western empire, and by the new papal&nbsp;policy which Nicholas V. inaugurated, that the old order of&nbsp;society was about to be superseded. Nothing remained&nbsp;to check those centrifugal forces in state and church&nbsp;which substituted a confederation of rival European&nbsp;powers for the earlier ideal of universal monarchy, and&nbsp;separate religious constitutions for the previous Catholic&nbsp;unity. At the same time the new learning introduced by&nbsp;the earlier humanists awakened free thought, encouraged&nbsp;curiosity, and prepared the best minds of Europe for&nbsp;speculative audacities from which the schoolmen would&nbsp;have shrunk, and which soon expressed themselves in acts&nbsp;of cosmopolitan importance. The new learning had been</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
