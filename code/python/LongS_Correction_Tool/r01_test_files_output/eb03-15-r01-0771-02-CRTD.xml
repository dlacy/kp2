W. Long. 5. 28. N. Lat. 34. 40.</p><p>Rabat, together with SaHee, which is opposite to it, was formerly famous for fitting out piratical vessels; but the late emperor Sidi Mahomet subdued them both, and annexed them to the empire; since which time the harbour of Rabat has been so filled with the sand washed in by the sea as to render it unfit to carry on such piracies in future.</p><p>The town of Rabat, whose walls inclose a large space of ground, is defended on the sea-fide by three forts to-lerably well finished, which were erected some little time ago by an English renegado, and furnished with guns from Gibraltar. The houses in general are good, and many of the inhabitants are wealthy. The Jews, who are very numerous in this place, are generally in better circumstances than those of Larache or Tangier, and their women are extremely beautiful.</p><p>The castle, which is very extensive, contains a strong building, formerly used by the late emperor as his prin-cipal treasury, and a noble terrace, which commands an extenfive prospect os the town of Sallee, the ocean, and all the neighbouring country. There are also the ruins of another castle, which is said to have been built by Jacob Almonzor, one of their former emperors, and of which at present very little remai∏3 but its walls, con-taining within them some very strong magazines for powder and naval stores. Οη the outside of these walls is a very high and square tower, handsomely built of cut stone, and called the tower of <hi rend="italic">Hajfin.</hi> From the workmanship of this tower, contrasted with the other buildings, a very accurate idea may be formed how great-ly the Moors have degenerated from their former splen-dour and taste for aιchitecture.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
