the capital of the province of Shirvan, in Persia, once large, populous, and commercial, but now ruined, and its remains entirely covered with thick brushwood. The modern city is called New Schamachi, and is situated in a plain on the river Aksisi, about thirty miles from the Kur, and nearly the same distance from the Caspian. It is built in a square form, each side of which is eight hundred paces long ; and the walls are in tolerable repair, built of unburned brick, and surrounded with a very broad and deep ditch. It is supposed to have contained 6000 inhabitants previous to its capture during the late war by Aga Mahommed. It was desolated by this tyrant, and has not recovered from its fallen state. Long. 48. 45. E. Lat. 40. 27. N.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
