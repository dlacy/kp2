<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">though some of its ablest representatives continued for some years to defend its positions. Hase’s summary is,&nbsp;that rationalism failed to recognize the historical forces&nbsp;that condition all religious life and progress; that it&nbsp;necessarily issued in a barren religion of the intellect;&nbsp;that in the last instance it drew its decisions, not from the&nbsp;depths of the soul, but from a shallow popular philosophy&nbsp;which overlooked the rights of religious feeling; that on&nbsp;that account it kept its God of the outward universe as&nbsp;far removed from men’s hearts and lives as possible; but&nbsp;that, nevertheless, it was through it especially that a&nbsp;breach between modern culture and the church was avoided&nbsp;and the banner of free inquiry was kept waving. Even&nbsp;men as far removed from rationalism as Tholuck, Dorner,&nbsp;Ritschl, and Alexander Schweizer acknowledge that it&nbsp;was a means, however imperfect, of effectually upholding&nbsp;in the church the great principle that religious truth has&nbsp;an intimate affinity to man’s nature and must be freely&nbsp;examined and intelligently appropriated. Tholuck pronounces it not an outward skin disease in the history of&nbsp;Protestantism, but an integral part of that history and a&nbsp;phase of its development, in some respects abnormal, in&nbsp;others normal and natural.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RATISBON (German </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Regensburg</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">), an ancient city of Bavaria, the seat of a bishop, and the capital of the Upper&nbsp;Palatinate, is pleasantly situated on the right bank of the&nbsp;Danube, opposite the influx of the Regen, from which it&nbsp;derives its German name. It lies almost exactly in the&nbsp;centre of the kingdom, about 65 miles to the north-east of&nbsp;Munich and 53 miles to the south-east of Nuremberg. On&nbsp;the other side of the river is the small town of Stadt-am-Hof, connected with Ratisbon by a long stone bridge of&nbsp;the 12th century, above and below which are the islands&nbsp;of the Obere and Untere Worth. In external appearance&nbsp;Ratisbon is quaint and romantic, presenting almost as&nbsp;faithful a picture of a town of the early Middle Ages&nbsp;as Nuremberg does of the later. Most of the streets&nbsp;are narrow and irregular, but spacious promenades have&nbsp;been laid out on the site of the old fortifications. One. of&nbsp;the most characteristic features in its architecture is the&nbsp;number of strong loopholed towers attached to the more&nbsp;ancient dwellings, recalling a day when civic broils were&nbsp;of frequent recurrence. The interesting “street of the&nbsp;ambassadors ” is so called because it contained the residences of most of the ambassadors to the German diet,&nbsp;whose coats-of-arms may still be seen on many of the&nbsp;houses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The cathedral of Ratisbon, though small in size, is a very interesting example of pure German Gothic, diverging in several points from the type elaborated in France.&nbsp;It was founded in 1275 and completed in 1634, with the&nbsp;exception of the towers, which were added during a recent&nbsp;restoration. The details are very harmonious and pleasing,&nbsp;and the interior contains numerous interesting monuments,&nbsp;including one of Peter Yischer’s masterpieces. Adjoining&nbsp;the cloisters are two chapels of earlier date than the cathedral itself, one of which, known as the “old cathedral,”&nbsp;goes back perhaps to the 8th century. The Schotten-kirche, a plain Romanesque basilica of the 12th century,&nbsp;derives its name from the monastery of Irish Benedictines&nbsp;(“Scoti”) to which it was attached; the principal doorway is covered with very singular grotesque carvings, the&nbsp;meaning of which remains a mystery. The old parish&nbsp;church of St Ulrich is a good example of the Transition</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">style of the 13th century. Other specimens of the Romanesque basilica style are the church of Obermiinster,&nbsp;dating from 1010, and the abbey church of St Emmeran,&nbsp;built in the 13th century and remarkable as one of the&nbsp;few German churches with a detached belfry. The beautiful cloisters of the ancient abbey, one of the oldest in&nbsp;Germany, are still in fair preservation. In 1809 the&nbsp;conventual buildings were converted into a palace for the&nbsp;prince of Thurn and Taxis, hereditary postmaster-general&nbsp;of the old German empire. The town-house, a somewhat&nbsp;gloomy pile, dating in part from the 14th century, contains&nbsp;the rooms occupied by the imperial diet of Germany from&nbsp;1663 to 1806. An historical interest also attaches to the&nbsp;Golden Cross Inn, where Charles Y. made the acquaintance&nbsp;of the fair Barbara Blumberger, the mother of Don John&nbsp;of Austria (b. 1547). The promenade is adorned with a&nbsp;bust of Kepler, who died at Ratisbon in 1630. Perhaps&nbsp;the most pleasing modern building in the city is the Gothic&nbsp;villa of the king of Bavaria on the bank of the Danube.&nbsp;Among the chief manufactures of Ratisbon are iron and&nbsp;steel wares, pottery, parquet flooring, and lead pencils.&nbsp;Boat-building is also prosecuted, and a brisk transit trade&nbsp;is carried on in salt, grain, and timber. In 1880 the town&nbsp;contained 34,516 inhabitants, of whom 27,844 were Roman&nbsp;Catholics, 5995 Protestants, and 675 Jews. Stadt-am-Hof, which practically forms a suburb of Ratisbon, contained 3392 inhabitants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Near Ratisbon are two very handsome classical buildings erected by Louis I. of Bavaria, with the aid of the architect Klenze, as&nbsp;national monuments of German patriotism and greatness. The&nbsp;more imposing of the two is the Walhalla, a costly reproduction&nbsp;of the Parthenon, erected as a Teutonic temple of fame on a hill&nbsp;rising from the Danube at Donaustauf, 6 miles to the east. The&nbsp;massive substructions of the temple somewhat dwarf the building&nbsp;itself when seen from a distance, and the choice of a classic model&nbsp;for a German Pantheon seems somewhat incongruous, but after&nbsp;these deductions are made it still remains a magnificent and&nbsp;imposing structure. The interior, which is as rich as coloured&nbsp;marbles, gilding, and sculptures can make it, contains the busts&nbsp;of more than a hundred German worthies. The second of King&nbsp;Louis’s buildings is the Befreiungshalle at Kelheim, 14 miles above&nbsp;Ratisbon, a large circular building, which has for its aim the&nbsp;glorification of the heroes of the war of liberation in 1813.</span></p>
