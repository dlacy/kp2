                        n="1"> This article represents a recast of the article contributed to the
                        9th edition of the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia</hi> by the late
                        Professor Muirhead. A large part of that article has been retained by the
                        present writer, and the plan of arrangement, though altered in some
                        respects, has been adhered to in the main. </note> The term “ Roman law ” is
                    indefinite and ambiguous, being used in more than one sense. First, in a wide
                    sense, it comprehends the totality of the laws of the Roman state, which were
                    observed by its subjects during about thirteen centuries, from Romulus to
                    Justinian. In a second and stricter meaning it indicates the law as consolidated
                    by Justinian or, in other words, the law contained in the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Corpus Juris Civilis,</hi> which is the name that has been given since the
                    16th century to Justinian’s legislative works as a whole, and distinguishes them
                    from the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris Canonici.</hi> In this acceptation it is
                    equivalent to, and is often called, “ civil law ” as contrasted with canon law.
                    In a third and loose sense Roman law em-braces, in addition to the <hi
                        rend="italic">Corpus Juris,</hi> the interpretations of it after Justinian
                    by medieval and modern courts, jurists and commentators adapting it to the
                    customs and laws of their own countries and times. The German expression, for
                    example, <hi rend="italic">modernes</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">heutiges)
                        römisches Recht,</hi> indicates the Roman law as it was applied in Germany
                    in modern times. Such medieval and modern interpretation, however, is also
                    sometimes expressed, in English usage at least, by the term “civil law ” as
                    contrasted with native or common law; writers in this field being usually styled
                    civilians rather than Romanists. It is to the Roman law in the first of the
                    above-mentioned three significations that the present article is devoted.</p>
               <p>To give a proper sketch of Roman law it must be treated historically. Nearly all
                    systems of positive law are the product more or less of an historic development,
                    but the Roman has this great advantage over other systems, that it was at all
                    times a homogeneous body complete in itself. For the Romans were comparatively
                    little indebted to other peoples for their jurisprudence, and, when they did
                    borrow legal ideas and institutions from others, they generally transformed or
                    modified these in adapting them to their own native system, so that they became
                    substantially Roman. Moreover, the various stages of progress of the law from
                    its genesis to its maturity and ultimate consolidation can be traced in unbroken
                    continuity. Beginning in 753 B.C., the traditionally accepted date of the
                    foundation of Rome, it continued its course till the death of Justinian in a.d.
                    565. Allowing for the first three centuries being without historic evidence, we
                    have at least an authenticated evolution of about 1000 years. Of no other system
                    of law, ancient or modern, can anything</p>
               <p>like the same thing be said.</p>
               <p>As to the proper method of historic treatment there have been different
                    opinions. Without going into these, it is enough to say that the subject may be
                    treated from two sides, viz. on the one side in relation to the external sources
                    of the law, including therein the political and social conditions and the
                    various constitutional changes at different periods affecting the development of
                    the law, as well as the modes in which the law manifested itself and the legal
                    literature from which our knowledge of it is derived; on the other side it may
                    be treated in relation to the several departments or institutions of the law in
                    view of their development or changes through time or circumstance, such as
                    marriage, slavery, property, and so forth. This corresponds to what Leibnitz
                    described as <hi rend="italic">external</hi> and <hi rend="italic">internal</hi>
                    history respectively, terms which are now rather out of vogue. Of course it is
                    possible to treat the historic sources of the law, constitutional and literary,
                    independently of the doctrines, and this is now often done; but unless both are
                    discussed the field of Roman law is not covered. Both the external and the</p>
               <p>internal history, however, may be treated together or in a measure interwoven,
                    and it is in this way that the subject is treated in the following pages. But
                    constitutional events affecting the law are only noticed very summarily, details
                    about these being given in separate articles.</p>
               <p>Modern writers on the history of the Roman law have as a rule, for the purpose
                    of systematic treatment, divided the subject into definite historic periods.
                    Gibbon, in the 44th chapter of his <hi rend="italic">Decline and Fall of the
                        Roman Empire,</hi> seems to have been the first to suggest this mode of
                    treatment, though the particular periods of division he selected (being based on
                    an artificial symmetry of about three hundred years each) are not satisfactory.
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> See to historic
                        epochs Muirhead, <hi rend="italic">Hist. Introd. io the Law oj Rome</hi>
                        (2nd ed. by Goudy, 1899), p. 421. </note> In the present article, the
                    division made by Muirhead in his article in the 9th edition of this
                    Encyclopaedia into five historic epochs has been left unaltered. These are: (1)
                    the regal period; (2) the jus <hi rend="italic">civile,</hi> representing the
                    period from the establishment of the Republic until the subjugation of central
                    and southern Italy; (3) the <hi rend="italic">jus gentium and jus
                        honorarium,</hi> representing the latter half of the Republic; (4) the <hi
                        rend="italic">jus naturale</hi> and maturity of Roman jurisprudence,
                    representing the period of the Empire until the beginning of the reign of
                    Diocletian; (5) the period of codification, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> from
                    Diocletian to Justinian. Not that there is any sharp or fundamental division
                    between these or, indeed, between any historic epochs. The law is a unity: it
                    has its roots in the past and grows with the nation itself, and, like it,
                    decays; there is no break in its continuity. The division is made merely for
                    convenient treatment of the subject.</p>
               <p>It must be kept in view that our knowledge of Roman customs and laws earlier
                    than the XII. Tables and even for some time after them cannot be based on strict
                    historical evidence; it is almost entirely traditional and conjectural, and
                    different writers will take different views according to the relative value they
                    place upon this or that piece of presumptive evidence.</p>

               <p>                    <hi rend="italic">The Beginnings oj the State.—</hi> The early Romans were not
                    different from other Indo-European communities in their essential
                    characteristics. The tribe, the clan, the family, the individual: each of these
                    appears in course of development prior to the XII. Tables. Putting aside much of
                    the traditional accounts of Livy, Dionysius, and other ancient historians,
                    regarding the foundation of Rome and its early political and social life, as
                    mythical, modern critical historians are none the less agreed that in the
                    earliest period of their existence as a settled community the Romans were
                    subjected to the government of a king <hi rend="italic">(rex),</hi> with a
                    council of elders <hi rend="italic">(senatus)</hi> and an assembly of burghers
                        <hi rend="italic">(comitia curiata).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It used to be a somewhat common opinion that the primitive Romans were a sort of
                    amalgam of three different races—Latin, Sabine and Etruscan. This opinion is
                    mainly based upon the tradition that the state was originally formed by a union
                    of three tribes called Ramnes, Tities and Luceres; the Ramnes being of the Latin
                    race, the Tities of the Sabine and the Luceres of the Etruscan. Attempts have
                    even been made to find in the Roman laws and institutions traces of the
                    influence of each of these races, and especially of the first two— <hi
                        rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">mamts,</hi> for
                    example, being attributed to the Latin or dominant race; adoption and
                    confarreation to the Sabine; forms and ceremonial (such as lictors, fasces,
                    &amp;c.) to the Etruscan. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    <head> Patricians, Clients and Plebeians.—But whatever their ethnographic
                        descent, it is pretty certain that the Roman civitas was in the earliest
                        period an organization that was patriarchal in its essence, but in which
                        there was to be distinguished, on the one hand, a dominant class enjoying
                        all the rights of citizenship, and, on the other, a semi-servile or
                        quasi-vassal class excluded from such rights. The former class were called
                        patricii or Quirites; <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                   <p>Patricians.—There was part of the law of Rome that even in the Empire was
                        known by the name of jus Quiritium, and this in the regal period was the
                        only law. The patricians at first were the Quirites, and prior at least to
                        the time of Servius Tullius they alone enjoyed rights under this law. From
                        their number the council of elders was selected; they alone could take part
                        in the curiate comitia; they alone could contract a lawful marriage and make
                        a testament; in a word, all the peculiar institutions of early Rome were for
                        their benefit alone.</p>
                   <p>But these rights and prerogatives they enjoyed as members of <hi
                            rend="italic">gentes</hi> or clans, the clans being aggregations of
                        families bear-ing a common name and theoretically at least tracing their
                        descent from a common ancestor. These clans, of which there were normally
                        three hundred altogether according to a rather doubtful tradition, were
                        organized consti-tutionally in curies. Of the curies, again, there were
                        thirty in all, there being probably ten in each of the three tribes,
                        organized primarily for military and secondarily for political and religious
                        purposes. Though for the federation of the <hi rend="italic">curiae</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi> Rome required a common ruler and common
                        institutions, religious, militarnd political, yet it was long before such
                        federation into a state displaced entirely the separate institutions of the
                        several <hi rend="italic">gentes.</hi> Every clan had its own cult peculiar
                        to its own members. It had its common property and its common burial-place.
                        It probably had some common council or assembly, for we read not only of
                        special gentile customs, but of gentile statutes and decrees. Tradition
                        records instances of wars waged by individual <hi rend="italic">gentes,</hi>
                        indicating that they had the right to require military service alike from
                        their members and dependants. Widows and orphans of deceased clansmen were
                        under the guardianship of the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> or of some
                        particular member of it to whom the trust was specially confided. If a
                        clansman left no descendants, his property passed to his fellow-gentiles.
                        Finally, its members were always entitled to rely upon its assistance, to
                        have maintenance when indigent, to be ransomed from captivity, and to be
                        avenged when killed or injured.</p>
                   <p>Alongwith the gentiles there were in Rome from the earliest period other
                        persons known by the name of <hi rend="italic">clientes</hi> (clients).
                        Their origin is wholly unknown. Some of them may have been the original
                        inhabitants of Rome and their</p>
                   <p>descendants,but more probably they were mostly immigrants from other
                        communities or citizens of conquered towns whom the Romans were unable or
                        unwilling to treat as slaves. Some may have been slaves to whom liberty <hi
                            rend="italic">de facto</hi> had been given. Following a custom familiar
                        both to Latins and Sabines, such persons were placed under the protection of
                        the heads of patrician families. The relationship was hereditary on both
                        sides, and known as that of patron and client. The client <note

                        family; and, as ownership or possession of lands increased in extent, it was
                        probably not unusual for the patron or his <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> to
                        give him during pleasure a plot of land to cultivate for himself. The patron
                        had, moreover, to assist him in his transactions with third parties, and
                        obtain redress for him when injured. The client, on the other hand, had to
                        maintain his patron’s interests by every means in his power. But the
                        advantage must have been chiefly on the side of the client, who, without
                        becoming a citizen, obtained directly the protection of his patron and his
                        clan, and indirectly that of the state. A large number of clients attached
                        themselves to and received protection from the king as patron—“ royal
                        clients,” as Cicero calls them.</p>
                   <p>The plebeians <hi rend="italic">(plebs,</hi> from ttX^os, meaning crowd), as
                        distinguished from the clients, must be regarded as a heterogeneous mass of
                        non-gentile freemen. It used to be the prevailing opinion among modern
                        writers, following the Roman historians, that the plebeians existed as a
                        body since the very beginning of the city. They were thought to be mainly
                        composed of immigrants and refugees who, wiiile being allowed personal
                        liberty, declined to submit themselves to a patron. But recently a theory of
                        Mommsen, based on solid philological and other grounds, has obtained wide
                        adhesion and tends to become the dominant one. Mommsen’s view is that at
                        first there were only two classes in the community, the patricians and
                        clients, or, in other words, that* the only plebeians were the clients who,
                        as such, possessed only quasi-liberty <hi rend="italic">(Halbfreiheit)</hi>
                        , and that it was not till after a century or two that the practice of
                        voluntary clientage began to decay and the class of plebeian freemen arose.
                        This was partly due to <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi> dying out, so that the
                        clients attached to them were left without patrons; partly to the numbers of
                        foreigners at Rome (through transplantation of the inhabitants of conquered
                        cities and otherwise) having become so large that they felt themselves
                        sufficiently powerful to do without protection; and partly to other causes

                   <p>However this be, it is generally admitted that, during the latter part of
                        the present epoch at least, plebeians existed as a body composed of
                        individuals of mixed races not united by any gentile organizations of their
                        own nor attached to any Roman <hi rend="italic">gentes.</hi> Tradition
                        attributes to Numa the formation of gilds or societies of craftsmen, such as
                        potters, carpenters, gold- and silver-smiths <hi rend="italic">{collegia
                            opificum)</hi> at Rome, eight or nine in number. This, though probably a
                        myth as regards Numa, may be taken as slight evidence of the creation among
                        the plebeians of associations for trade and other purposes, that to some
                        extent compensated them for the want of gentile organization. These gilds
                        seem to have had a common cult and a common council to arrange disputes and
                        consolidate customs. Between the brethren <hi rend="italic">(sodales)</hi>
                        there was a bond of close alliance and interdependence, each owing duty to

                        heaven for men on earth, much of it regulative of ceremonial, but a by no
                        means insignificant part embodying rules of conduct. It appears to have had
                        a wider range than Jus. It forbade that a war should be undertaken without
                        the prescribed fetial ceremonial, and required that faith should be kept
                        even with an enemy when a promise had been made to him under sanction of an
                        oath. It enjoined hospitality to foreigners, because the stranger guest was
                        presumed, equally with his entertainer, to be an object of solicitude to a
                        higher power. It punished murder, for it was the taking of a god-given life;
                        the sale of a wife by her husband, for she had become his partner in all
                        things human and divine; the lifting of a hand against a parent, for it was
                        subversive of the first bond of society and religion,—the reverence due by a
                        child to those to whom he owed his existence; incestuous connexions, for
                        they defiled the altar; the false oath and the broken vow, for they 'were an
                        insult to the divinities invoked; the displacement of a boundary or a
                        landmark, not so much because the act was provocative of feud, as because
                        the march-stone itself, as the guarantee of peaceful neighbourhood, was
                        under the guardianship of the gods. Some breaches of <hi rend="italic"
                            >fas</hi> were cxpiable, usually by a peace-offering to the offended
                        god; others were inexpiable. When an offence was inexpiable, the punishment
                        was usually what is called <hi rend="italic">sacratio capitis,</hi>
                        excommunication and outlawry of the offender. The precepts of the <hi
                            rend="italic">fas</hi> therefore were not mere exhortations to a
                        blameless life, but closely approached to laws, whose violation was visited
                        with punishments none the less effective that they</p>
                   <p>were religious rather than civil.</p>
                   <p>The derivation of the word <hi rend="italic">jus</hi> is disputed. The usual
                        derivation is from the Sanskrit, , to “ join, bind or unite,” from which

                        regarded as a divine office, and their vote might be nullified by the

                            >gentes</hi> varied, and that they only gradually approximated, and in

                        one of the rcgulativcs of public and private order Part of what fell within

                        brought within the domain of these last, and even down to the end of the

                        family tribunal or the censor’s <hi rend="italic">regimen morum.</hi> The
                        functions of those who took charge of <hi rend="italic">boni mores</hi> were
                        twofold: sometimes they restrained by publicly condemning—though they could
                        not prevent—the ruthless and unnecessary exercise of legal right, as, for
                        example, that of the head of the house over his dependants, and sometimes
                        they supplied deficiencies in the law by requiring observance of duties that
                        could not be enforced by any legal process. Dutiful service, respect and
                        obedience from inferiors to superiors,chastity, and fidelity to engagements,
                        express or implied <hi rend="italic">(fides),</hi> were among the <hi

                        punishments and disabilities, social, political or religious. It was the
                        duty of those in authority to enforce their observance by such <hi

                        generally; and many a wrong was prevented not by fear of having to make
                        reparation to the party injured but by the dread of the penalties that would
                        follow conduct unbecoming an upright citizen.</p>
                   <p>That the bulk of the law during the regal period was customary is

                        the XII. Tables is generally believed. Yet the jurist Pomponius, a
                        contemporary of Hadrian, speaks of certain laws enacted by the comitia of
                        the curies, which he calls <hi rend="italic">leges regiae</hi> and which, he
                        says, were collected by one Sextus Papirius, a prominent citizen in the

                        Gibbon) to Granius Flaccus himself. Nevertheless, the internal evidence from
                        the character and language of the laws themselves (apart from the weight
                        that must be given to the testimony of Pomponius, Servius and other ancient

                        the view that the <hi rend="italic">leges regiae</hi> are authentic remains
                        of laws of the regal period. This does not, however, involve the belief that

                   </p>
                   <p>It is generally agreed that towards the end of the regal period, and
                        connected with the king traditionally called Servius Tullius, a great reform
                        of the constitution took place, which exercised much influence on the
                        subsequent development of the law. No doubt there is a good deal of myth
                        attached to the name of Servius, who seems to have been regarded by later
                        Romans as a popular monarch, like Alfred by the English, but the main
                        features of the traditional account of the constitutional reforms of this
                        period may be taken as based on fair presumptive evidence. That all of them
                        indeed were evolved from one brain is hardly credible, and that some of them
                        were in observance <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> before being made
                        constitutionally binding is very likely.</p>
                   <p>The design attributed to Servius was that of altering the old constitution
                        in order to promote an advance tovzards equality between patricians and
                        plebeians. He is credited with having desired, on the one hand, to
                        ameliorate the position of the <hi rend="italic">plebs</hi> and, on the
                        other, to make them bear a proportionate share of the burdens of the
                        state—in particular, to serve in the army and contribute to the war tax <hi
                            rend="italic">{tributum).</hi> He effected this by giving them qualified
                        rights of citizenship, not indeed by admitting them into the gentile
                        organizations, but by creating a new political assembly of a distinctly
                        military character in which they as well as the gentiles could take part.
                        The so-called Servian reforms may be roughly summarized under the following
                        four heads, viz. (i) a division of the Roman territory within the city walls
                        into four local wards called <hi rend="italic">tribus</hi> (to which a
                        number of tribes outside the city— <hi rend="italic">tribus rusticae—</hi>
                        were afterwards in course of time added); (2) the establishment of a
                        register of the citizens <hi rend="italic">{census)</hi> which was to
                        contain, in addition to a record of the strength of their families, a
                        statement of the value of their lands, with the slaves and cattle employed
                        in their cultivation, and which was to be revised periodically; (3) a
                        division of the people, as appearing in the census, into five classes for
                        military purposes, determined by the value of their holdings in land and its
                        appurtenances, with a subdivision of each class into so-called <hi
                            rend="italic">centuriae;</hi> (4) the creation of a new assembly with
                        legislative power called <hi rend="italic">comitia centuriata,</hi> in which
                        the vote was to be taken by <hi rend="italic">centuriae.</hi> While it may
                        be an open question how far these reforms, and particularly the institution
                        of the centuriate comitia, were actually due to Servius, or only a result of
                        his arrangements, the whole conception of the new constitution is obviously
                        of early date and indicative of considerable statesmanship.</p>
                   <p>The plebeians were thereby made constitutionally part of the <hi

                            whole tradition about the Servian reforms untrustworthy, but the

                        assembly. It is indeed probable that a good while before Servius the
                        conception of individual ownership of lands and things necessary for their
                        cultivation had been reached, and that such ownership was recognized not
                        only among the gentiles, but also <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> even more
                        largely among the plebeians. The common lands of the <hi rend="italic"

                        families and individuals. However this be, the creation of the <hi

                        title, as it was declared that no transfers of property enrolled in it would
                        be recognized unless made by public con-veyance with observance of certain

                        maternal grandfather; for children born in lawful marriage followed the
                        family of their father, while those who were illegitimate ranked from the
                        moment of birth as <hi rend="italic">patresfamilias</hi> and <hi

                   </p>
                   <p>With the early Romans, as with the Hindus and the Greeks, marriage was a
                        religious duty a man owed alike to his ancestors and to himself. Believing
                        that the happiness of the dead in another world depended on their proper
                        burial and on the periodical renewal by their descendants of prayers and
                        feasts and offerings for the repose of their souls, it was incumbent upon
                        him above all things to perpetuate his race and his family cult. The Romans
                        were always strictly monogamous. In taking to himself a wife, he was about
                        to detach her from her father’s house and make her a partner of his family
                        mysteries. With the patrician at least this was to be done only with divine
                        approval, ascertained by <hi rend="italic">auspicia.</hi> His choice was
                        limited to a woman with whom he had <hi rend="italic">connubinm</hi>
                        (ertyajuia) or right of intermarriage. This was a matter of state
                        arrangement; and in the regal period Roman citizens could have it outside
                        their own bounds only with members of states with which they were in
                        alliance, and with which they were connected by the bond of common religious
                        observances. A patrician citizen, therefore, if his marriage was to be
                        reckoned lawful <hi rend="italic">(justae nuptiae),</hi> had to wed either a
                        fellow-patrician or a woman who was a member of an allied community. In
                        either case it was essential that she should be outside his sobrinal circle,
                            <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> more remote in kinship than the sixth
                        degree. The ceremony was a religious one, conducted by the chief pontiff and
                        the flamen of Jupiter, in presence of ten witnesses, representatives
                        probably of the ten curies of the bridegroom’s tribe, and was known as <hi
                            rend="italic">farreum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">confarreatio.</hi> Its
                        effect was to</p>
                   <p>dissociate the wife entirely from her father’s house, and to make <hi
                            rend="sub">t</hi> her a member of her husband’s; for confarreate
                        marriage involved <hi rend="italic">in manum conventio,</hi> the passage of
                        the wife into her husband’s “ hand” or power, provided he was himself <hi
                            rend="italic">pater-Jamilias}</hi> if he was not, then, though nominally
                        in his hand, she was really subject like him to his family head. Any
                        property she had of her own—which was possible only if she had been
                        independent before marriage—passed to him as a matter of course; if she had
                        none, her <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> usually provided her a dowry
                            <hi rend="italic">(dos),</hi> which shared the same fate. In fact, so
                        far as her patrimonial interests were concerned, she was in much the same
                        position as her children; and on her husband’s death she had a share with
                        them in his inheritance as if she had been one of his daughters. In other
                        respects <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> conferred more limited rights than <hi
                            rend="italic">patria potestas]</hi> for Romulus is said to have ordained
                        that, if a man put away his wife except for adultery or one or two other
                        grave offences, he forfeited his estate half to her and half to Ceres, while
                        if he sold her he was to be given over to the infernal gods. <note

                            sell his wife is one on which modern writers are not agreed. The better
                            opinion is that he could not do so if the marriage was by confarreation.
                            Apart from the <hi rend="italic">lex regia</hi> above mentioned, it
                            would have been inconsistent with her dignity as <hi rend="italic"

                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Patria potestas</hi> was the name given to the power
                        exercised by a father, or by his <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> if he
                        was himself <hi rend="italic">in potestate,</hi> over the issue of such <hi
                            rend="italic">justae nuptiae.</hi> The Roman jurists boasted that it was
                        a right enjoyed by none but Roman citizens; and it certainly was peculiar to
                        them in this sense, that nowhere else, except perhaps among the Latin race
                        from which they had sprung, did the paternal power attain such an intensity.
                        The omnipotence of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> and the
                        condition of utter subjection to him of his children <hi rend="italic">in
                            potestate</hi> became greatly modified in the course of centuries; but
                        originally the children, though in public</p>
                   <p>life on an equality with the house-father, in private life, and so long as
                        the <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> lasted, were subordinated to him to such
                        an extent as, according to the letter of the law, to be in his hands little
                        better than his slaves. They could have nothing of their own: all they
                        earned was his; and, though it was quite common when they grew up for him to
                        give them <hi rend="italic">peculia,</hi> “ cattle of their own,” to manage
                        for their own benefit, these were only <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi>
                        theirs, but <hi rend="italic">de jure</hi> his. For offences committed by
                        them outside the family circle, for which he was not prepared to make
                        amends, he had to surrender them to the injured party, just like slaves or
                        animals that had done mischief. If his right to them was disputed, he used
                        the same action for its vindication that he employed for asserting his
                        ownership of his field or his house: if they were stolen, he proceeded
                        against the thief by an ordinary action of theft; if for any reason he had
                        to transfer them to a third party, it was by the same form of conveyance
                        that he used for the transfer of things inanimate. Nor was this all; for,
                        according to the old formula recited in that sort of adoption known as
                        adrogation, he had over them the power of life and death, <hi rend="italic"
                            >jus vitae necisque.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>It might happen that a marriage was fruitless, or that a man saw all his
                        sons go to the grave before hirn, and that the <hi rend="italic"
                            >paterfamilias</hi> had thus to face the prospect of the extinction of
                        his family and of his own descent to the tomb without posterity to make him
                        blessed. To obviate so dire a misfortune, he resorted to the practice of
                        adoption, so common in India and Greece. If it was a <hi rend="italic"
                            >paterfamilias</hi> that he adopted, the process was called adrogation
                            <hi rend="italic">(adrogatio)</hi> ; if it was a <hi rend="italic"
                            >filiusfaniilias</hi> it was simply <hi rend="italic">adoptio.</hi> The
                        latter, unknown probably in the earlier regal period, was, as we first know
                        it, a somewhat complicated conveyance of a son by his natural parent to his
                        adopter, the purpose of course being expressed; its effect was simply to
                        transfer the child from the one family to the other. But the former was much
                        more serious, for it involved the extinction of one family that another
                        might be perpetuated. It was therefore an affair of state. It had to be
                        approved by the pontiffs,. who probably had to satisfy themselves that there
                        were relatives of the adro-gatee to attend to the <hi rend="italic"
                            >manes</hi> of the ancestors whose cult he was renouncing; and on their
                        favourable report it had to be sanctioned by a vote of the curies, as it
                        involved the deprivation of his <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> of their
                        possible right of succession to him and possible prejudice to creditors
                        through <hi rend="italic">capitis deminutio.</hi> If it was sanctioned, then
                        the <hi rend="italic">adrogatus,</hi> from being himself the head of a
                        house, sank to the position of a <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> in
                        the house of his adopting parent; if he had had wife or children subject to
                        him, they passed with him into his new family, and so did everything that
                        belonged to him and that was capable of transmission from one person to
                        another. The adopting parent acquired <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> over
                        the adopted child exactly as if he were the issue of his body; while the
                        latter enjoyed in his new family the same rights exactly that he would have
                        had if he had been born in it.</p>
                   <p>The <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">patria
                            potestas</hi> represent the masterful aspects of the patrician’s
                        domestic establishment. Its conjugal and parental ones, however, though not
                        so prominent in the pages of the jurists, are not to be lost sight of.</p>
                   <p>The patrician family in the early history of the law was governed as much by
                            <hi rend="italic">fas</hi> as by <hi rend="italic">jus.</hi> The husband
                        was priest in the family, but wife and children alike assisted in its
                        prayers, and took part in the sacrifices to its lares and penates. As the
                        Greek called his wife the house-mistress, ¿«nron'a, so did the Roman speak
                        of his as <hi rend="italic">materfamilias,</hi>

                        equal. As for their children, the <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> was so
                        tempered by the natural sense of parental duty on the one side and filial
                        affection on the other that in daily life it was rarely felt as a grievance;
                        while the risk of an arbitrary exercise of the domestic jurisdiction,
                        whether in the heat of passion or under the impulse of justifiable
                        resentment, was</p>

                   <p>guarded against by the rule which required in grave eases the <hi
                            rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> to consult in the first place the near
                        kinsmen oí his child, maternal as well as paternal. Even the incapacity of
                        the children of the family to acquire property of their own cannot in those
                        times have been regarded as any serious hardship; for, though the legal
                        title to all their acquisitions was in the housefather during his life, yet
                        in truth they were acquired for and belonged to the family as a whole, and
                        he was little more than a trustee to hold and administer them for the common
                        benefit.</p>
                   <p>The <hi rend="italic">patria potestas,</hi> unless the <hi rend="italic"
                            >paterfamilias</hi> voluntarily put an end to it, lasted as long as he
                        lived and retained his status. The marriage of a son, unlike that of a
                        daughter passing into the hand of a husband, did not release him from it,
                        nor did his children become subject to him so long as he himself was <hi
                            rend="italic">in potestate.</hi> On the contrary, his wife passed on
                        marriage into the power of her father-in-law, and their children as they
                        were born fell under that of their paternal grandfather; and the latter was
                        entitled to exercise over his daughters-in-law and grandchildren the same
                        rights that he had over his sons and unmarried daughters. But there was this
                        difference, that, when the <hi rend="italic">pater-familias</hi> died, his
                        sons and daughters who had remained <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi> and
                        his grandchildren by a predeceased son instantly became their own masters
                            <hi rend="italic">(sui juris))</hi> whereas grandchildren by a surviving
                        son simply passed from the <hi rend="italic">pot estas</hi> of their
                        grandfather into that of their father.</p>
                   <p>The acquisition of domestic independence by the death of the family head
                        frequently involved the substitution of the guardianship of tutors <hi

                        It is improbable that during the regal period a testamentary appointment of
                        tutors by a husband or parent to wife or children was known in practice. In

                        community of interests tend inevitably to unify customs and cause
                        dissimilarities to disappear, and the plebeians must have not only gradually
                        brought their own customs into unison <hi rend="italic">inter se,</hi> but

                        be so, but it is improbable. As the plebeians obtained by the Servian

                        them to adapt the modes sanctioned for acquiring property to the acquisition
                        of marital <hi rend="italic">manus. Coemptio</hi> was just a simple
                        adaptation of mancipation above referred to (see also <hi rend="italic"
                            >infra,</hi> p. 540). It was, as we may infer from what we know of it at
                        a later time, a sale of the woman to the man <hi rend="italic">per aes et
                            libram</hi> for a nominal price. The price being fictitious, a piece of
                        copper <hi rend="italic">(raudusculum)</hi> was used to represent it, and
                        this was handed over to the seller, who would ordinarily be the woman’s <hi

                            mutual purchase, the man and woman taking alternately the position of

                        might, as Gaius informs us, follow the marriage at any distance of time, and

                        Students of comparative law have observed that in <hi rend="italic"
                            >coemptio</hi> there arc clear traces of earlier bride purchase, so
                        common even nowadays among uncivilized tribes, where a real price in cattle
                        or sheep, and not a mere nominal one, has to be paid for the bride. <hi

                        marital <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> by possession of the woman as wife for

                        this was recognized by the law prior to the XII. Tables depends probably
                        upon whether usucaption, as a mode of acquiring property, was settled by
                        custom earlier than the Tables. Some writers, however, think it older than

                        <hi rend="italic">—</hi> The history of the early Roman community, like many
                        other primitive communities, is marked by the disintegration of the <hi
                            rend="italic">gentes</hi> and the growth of individual property. Yet the
                        distribution of land, amongst the early Romans is one of the puzzling
                        problems of their history. The Servian constitution' apparently classified
                        the citizens and determined their privileges, duties and burdens according
                        to the extent of their lands; and yet we know nothing for certain of the way
                        in which these were acquired. All is conjectural. We have indeed a
                        traditional account of a partition by Romulus of the little territory of his
                        original settlement into three parts, one of which was devoted to the
                        maintenance of the state and its institutions, civil and religious, the
                        second <hi rend="italic">(ager publicus)</hi> to the use of the citizens and
                        profit of the state, and the third <hi rend="italic">(ager privatus)</hi>
                        subdivided among his followers. Varro and Pliny relate that to each <hi
                            rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> among his followers he assigned a
                        homestead <hi rend="italic">(keredium)</hi> of two jugera, equal to about an
                        acre and a quarter. These <hi rend="italic">heredia</hi> were to be held by
                        him and his heirs for ever <hi rend="italic">(quae heredem
                            sequerentur);</hi> Pliny adding that to none did the king give more.
                        This can only be accepted as a partially correct account of what may have
                        taken place at some early period during the kingly regime. There can be
                        little doubt that a portion of the Roman territory, gradually augmented
                        through new conquests, was early reserved by the state as <hi rend="italic"
                            >ager publicus*,</hi> that is sufficiently attested by the complaints
                        made for centuries by the plebeians of its monopolization by the patricians.
                        It is also probable that <hi rend="italic">heredia (i.e.</hi> plots of land
                        within the city) may have been granted to the heads of the gentile families,
                        many of whom would be living in <hi rend="italic">pagi</hi> on their
                        respective gentile lands outside the city. Such <hi rend="italic"
                            >heredia</hi> became family property, administered as such by the <hi
                            rend="italic">paterfamilias,</hi> but inalienable by him. In this
                        respect the position would be very similar to what existed among the ancient
                        Germans and exists to-day in India among the Hindus. Even late in the
                        Republic, when the idea of</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0532" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0573.jp2"/>
                   <p>individual ownership was paramount, it was still considered a disgrace for a
                        man to alienate his <hi rend="italic">heredium.</hi> But though the
                        existence of monogamous families seems to ‘imply private ownership to some
                        extent, yet, as formerly indicated, a large part of the Roman territory at,
                        and for a good while after, the foundation of the city must have been
                        gentile lands held by the separate clans for the use of their members. The
                        fact that the majority of the rural tribes bore the names of well-known
                        patrician <hi rend="italic">gentes</hi> favours the conclusion that even in
                        the later regal period a good many of the clans still held lands in their
                        collective capacity. It was at some uncertain time before Servius that there
                        began to be a break-up of these gentile lands and their appropriation by
                        individual members. Under the influence of this movement lands were acquired
                        and held by families and individuals to a large extent. A patrician’s
                        holding must have been sometimes pretty large so as to enable him to make
                        grants (so often alluded to by ancient writers) to his clients, but we have
                        no means of estimating the normal size. The <hi rend="italic">heredia</hi>
                        were small; even during the Republic there is some evidence <hi
                            rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> the traditional story about Cincinnatus) that
                        seven jugera were regarded as the normal extent of a patrician’s holding for
                        his own and his family’s use. On the other hand, twenty jugera are commonly
                        supposed to have been the qualification for enrolment in the first of the
                        Servian classes. Of course it must be kept in view that a patrician did not
                        necessarily hold all his lands by gratuitous assignation or concession
                        either from the state or from his <hi rend="italic">gens',</hi> purchase
                        from the former was by no means uncommon, and it may have been on his
                        purchased lands that his clients were usually placed. Those dependants were
                        also probably employed in large numbers upon those
                        parts of the <hi rend="italic">ager publicus</hi> which were occupied by the
                        patricians and were in historic times known as <hi rend="italic"
                            >possessions.</hi> These, of course, were not the property of their
                        occupants; it was the lands acquired by assignation or purchase that were
                        alone, apart from the <hi rend="italic">heredia,</hi> regarded as theirs <hi
                            rend="italic">ex jure Quiritium.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>The traditional accounts of the early distribution of lands among the
                        plebeians are even, if possible, more vague than those regarding the
                        patricians. They had apparently become holders <hi rend="italic">de
                            facto</hi> of land in large numbers before the Servian reforms. But they
                        can have attained that position only by gradual stages. While their earliest
                        grants of land, probably from the kings, can only have been during pleasure,
                        latterly, as they increased in number and importance, they were allowed to
                        have permanent possession. That those who had means also acquired lands by
                        purchase from the state may be taken for granted. The distinction between
                            <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> possession and ownership was at best a
                        very vague one at this period, and, like the holders of provincial lands in
                        later times, the plebeians might have the benefits of ownership without
                        ownership. The result of the Servian constitution was to convert this <hi
                            rend="italic">de facto</hi> property or permanent</p>
                   <p>possession into quiritarian ownership. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                            <hi rend="italic">meum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tuum</hi> must have
                        been well recognized, <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> at least. Men must
                        have been in the habit of transferring things from one to another by simple

                        theftuous ” appropriation of things in a man’s occupation would be punished
                        by magisterial authority or by ordinary self-redress by the injured party. A
                        sort of ownership in</p>
                   <p>possession must at least have been recognized for movables generally. <note

                   <p>But apart from this, we must believe that certain kinds of movables, viz.
                        those which have been described as appurtenant to land and necessary for its
                        cultivation—which with land formed the real objects, as distinct from the
                        personal subjects, of the <hi rend="italic">familia—</hi> were treated from
                        the time of Romulus downwards, as <hi rend="italic">in manu</hi> of the <hi

                            mancipi</hi> already referred to. Quiritarian ownership in them, as we
                        have seen, was recognized both for patricians and plebs by the Servian
                        constitution, periodical registration of them in the census and transference
                        by the quasi-public act of mancipation being probably required. Earlier even
                        than with lands, the conception of private ownership, it has been said,
                        connected itself with them. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                            type="authorial" n="30"> Mancipation seems to have been a very ancient
                            mode of conveyance. The use of the balance in barter or sale was known
                            to the ancient Egyptians at least as early as 2000 B.C., as may be seen
                            on reliefs in the temple of Dehr-el-Bahri in Upper Egypt. The derivation
                            of <hi rend="italic">mancipium (mancipatio)</hi> from <hi rend="italic"
                                >manu capere,</hi> to seize with the hand, is given by Gaius and is
                            confirmed by the fact that at all times in its history the acquirer had
                            to lay his hand on the thing being acquired, during the ceremony, if a
                            movable. So where several things were being mancipated in a lot, this
                            had to be done to each separately. With lands and other immovables it
                            was different: they snight be mancipated in absence, which goes some way
                            to prove that mancipation must have been extended to them at a later
                            period. The derivation of <hi rend="italic">mancipatio</hi> given by
                            Muirhead <hi rend="italic">(Historicat Introduction,</hi> 2nd ed., pp.

                            places the abstract idea of power before the concrete symbol of it. Cf.

                   </p>
                   <p>A short explanation may now be given of the ceremony of mancipation and the
                        nature of <hi rend="italic">res mancipi.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>Mancipation is described by Gaius, with particular reference to the
                        conveyance of movable <hi rend="italic">res mancipi,</hi> as a pretended
                        sale in presence of not less than five citizens as witnesses and a <hi
                            rend="italic">libripens</hi> holding a pair of copper scales. The
                        transferee, with one hand on the thing being transferred, and using certain
                        words of style, declared it his by purchase with a piece of copper (which he
                        he’d in his other hand) and the scales <hi rend="italic">(hoc acre aeneaque
                            libra)',</hi> and simultaneously he struck the scales with the <hi
                            rend="italic">as,</hi> which he then handed to the transferrer as
                        figurative of the price. The principal variation when it was-an immovable
                        that was being transferred was that, the mancipation did not require to be
                        on the spot: the land was simply described by its known name in the
                        valuation roll. Although in the time of Gaius only a fictitious sale—in fact
                        the formal conveyance upon a relative contract—yet it was not always so. Its
                        history is very simple.. The use ol the scales fixes its introduction at a
                        time when coined money was not yet current, but raw copper nevertheless had
                        become a standard of value and in a manner a medium of exchange. That,
                        however, was not in the first days of Rome. Then, and for a long time,
                        values were estimated in cattle or sheep, fines were imposed in them, and
                        the deposits in the <hi rend="italic">legis actio sacramento (infra,</hi> p.
                        549) took the same form. The use of copper as a substitute for them in
                        private transactions was probably derived from Etruria. But, being only raw
                        metal or foreign coins, it could be made available for loans or payments
                        only when weighed in the scales: it passed by weight, not by tale. There is
                        no reason for supposing that the weighing was a solemnity, that it had any
                        significance beyond its obvious purpose of enabling parties to ascertain
                        that a vendor or borrower was getting the amount of copper for which he had
                        bargained.</p>
                   <p>It was this practice of everyday life in private transactions that Servius
                        apparently adopted as the basis of his mancipatory conveyance, engrafting on
                        it one or two new features intended to give it publicity and, as it were,
                        state sanction, and thus render it more serviceable in the transfer of
                        censuable property. Instead of the parties themselves using the scales, an
                        impartial balance-holder, probably an official, was required to undertake
                        the duty, and at least five citizens were required to attend as witnesses,
                        who were to be the vouchers to the census officials of the regularity of the
                        procedure. Whether they were intended as representatives of the five classes
                        in which Servius had distributed the population, and thus virtually of the
                        state, is disputed, though the fact that, when the parties appealed to them
                        for their testimony, they were addressed not as <hi rend="italic"
                            >testes</hi> but as <hi rend="italic">Quirites</hi> lends some colour to
                        this view. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="31"> See
                            Gai. ii. § 104. </note> Servius is also credited with the introduction
                        of rectangular pieces of copper of different but carefully adjusted weights,
                        stamped by his authority with various devices <hi rend="italic">(aes
                            signatum),</hi> which are</p>

                   <p>usually supposed to have been intended to take the place of the raw metal
                            <hi rend="italic">(aes rude)</hi> formerly in use, and so facilitate the
                        process of weighing; but there is more reason for thinking they were cast
                        and stamped as standards to be put into one scale, while the raw metal whose
                        weight was to be ascertained was put into the other.</p>
                   <p>Instead, therefore, of being a fictitious sale, as Gaius describes it, and
                        as it became after the introduction of coined money in the 4th century of
                        the city, the mancipation, as regulated by Servius, was an actual completed
                        sale in the strictest sense of the term. What were the precise words of
                        style addressed by the transferee to the transferrer, or what exactly the
                        form of the ceremonial, we know not. But, as attendance during all the time
                        that some thousands of pounds, perhaps of copper, were being weighed would
                        have been an intolerable burden upon the five citizens convoked to discharge
                        a public duty, it may be surmised that it early became a common practice to
                        have the price weighed beforehand, and then to re weigh, or pretend to
                        reweigh, before the witnesses only a single little bit of metal <hi
                            rend="italic">(raudusculum)</hi> , which the transferee then handed to
                        the transferrer as “ the first pound and the last,” and thus representative
                        of the whole. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="32">
                            The conjecture is suggested by the words of style in the <hi
                                rend="italic">solutio per aes et libram,</hi> Gai. iii. §§ 173, 174.
                            There were some debts from which a man could be effectually discharged
                            only by payment (latterly fictitious) by copper and scales in the
                            presence of a <hi rend="italic">libripens</hi> and the usual five
                            witnesses. In the words addressed to the creditor by. the debtor making
                            payment these occurred— <hi rend="italic">hanc tibi libram primam
                                postremamque expendo</hi> (“ I weigh out to you this the first and
                            the last pound ”). The idea is manifestly archaic, and the words, taken
                            strictly, are quite inappropriate to the transaction in the form it had
                            assumed long before the time of Gaius. </note> And where no real price
                        was intended, as in constituting a <hi rend="italic">dos</hi> or in
                        coemption, a <hi rend="italic">raudusculum</hi> would also be employed.
                        Whatever may have been its form, however its effect was instant exchange of
                        property against a price weighed in the scales. The resulting obligation on
                        the vendor to maintain the title of the vendee, and the qualifications that
                        might be superinduced on the conveyance by agreement of parties —the
                        so-called <hi rend="italic">leges mancipii—</hi> will be considered below in
                        connexion with the provisions of the XII. Tables on the subject <hi
                            rend="italic">(infra</hi> , p. 542).</p>
                   <p>The things included in the class of <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> were
                        lands and houses held on Quiritarian title, together with rights of way and
                        aqueduct, slaves, and the following domestic beasts of draught or burden,
                        viz. oxen, horses, mules and donkeys; all others were <hi rend="italic">res
                            nec mancipi.</hi> Many theories have been propounded to account for the
                        distinction between these two classes of things, and to explain the
                        principle of selection that admitted oxen and horses into the one, but
                        relegated such animals as sheep and swine to the other. But there is really
                        little difficulty. Under the arrangement of Servius, wha.t was to determine
                        the nature and extent of a citizen’s political qualifications, military
                        duties and financial burdens was apparently the value of his <hi
                            rend="italic">heredium</hi> (and other lands, if he had any), and what
                        may be called its appurtenances—the slaves that worked for the household,
                        the slaves and beasts of draught and burden that worked the farm, all of
                        which lived and worked in common with the free members of the <hi
                            rend="italic">familia.</hi> But the cattle a man depastured on the
                        public meadows were no more <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> than his
                        sheep, a fact which, though ultimately in the later Empire lost sight of,
                        was still understood in the time of Gaius. <note anchored="true"

                        classed as <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> were selected for that
                        distinction by Servius because they were what were essential to a family
                        engaged in agricultural pursuits would be to fall short of the truth. They
                            <hi rend="italic">constituted</hi> the <hi rend="italic">familia</hi> in
                        the sense of the family estate proper; whereas the herds and flocks, and

                        under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">petunia.</hi> So the words are
                        to be understood perhaps in the well-known phraseology of the mancipatory
                        testament, <hi rend="italic">familia pecuniaque mea.</hi>

                        in use, was not long in being adapted to and utilized for other transactions
                        in which other kinds of <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> were sought to be
                        acquired. These new adaptations, if confined at first for the most part to
                        plebeians, were also soon made use of by the patricians, perhaps before as
                        well as after the XII. Tables, and became by custom part of the common law.
                        Such were, for example, coemption (as explained above), emancipation and

                        intermediate class under the name of agnates does not seem well founded as
                        regards the regal period; the succession of agnates as such seems to have
                        been first legally recognized by the XII. Tables, probably to meet the case
                        of the plebeians, who, having no <hi rend="italic">gentes,</hi> were without
                        legal heirs in default of children. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                            type="authorial" n="35"> It is quite true, however, that from the first
                            the order of succession was agnatic; for it was those only of a man’s
                            children who were agnate that had any claim to his inheritance; and the
                                <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> was, theoretically at least, just a body
                            of agnates. The supposed mention of agnates in a law attributed to Numa
                            is a conjecture of P. E. Huschke’s (in <hi rend="italic">Analecta
                                litteraria,</hi> Leipzig, 1826, p. 375). The law is preserved in
                            narrative by Servius, <hi rend="italic">In Virg. Eclog.</hi> iv. 43,
                            which runs thus: “ In Numae legibus cautum est, ut si quis im-prudens
                            occidisset hominem, pro capite occisi et naris ejus in cautione
                            (Scalig.. concione) offerret arietem.” Huschke’s substitution of <hi
                                rend="italic">agnatis</hi> for <hi rend="italic">et natis</hi> is
                            all but universally adopted; but, even were it necessary, it need mean
                            nothing more than his children <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi> or
                            his <hi rend="italic">gens.</hi>

                            avowedly introduced something new in prohibiting a man of fortune from
                            instituting a woman, even his only daughter, as his testamentary heir;
                            but even it did not touch the law of intestacy. See Girard, <hi
                                rend="italic">Manuel,</hi> 4th ed. p. 816. </note> But it was rather
                        nominal than real. A daughter who had passed into the hand of a husband
                        during her father’s lifetime of course could have no share in the latter’s
                        inheritance, for she had ceased to be a member of his family. One who was
                            <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi> at his death, and thereby became <hi
                            rend="italic">sui juris,</hi> did become his heir, unless he had
                        prevented such a result by testamentary arrangements; but even then it was
                        in the hands of the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> to prevent risk of prejudice
                        to themselves. For she could not marry, and so carry her fortune into
                        another family, without their consent as her guardians; neither could she
                        without their consent alienate any of the more valuable items of it; nor,
                        even with their consent, could she make a testament disposing of it in
                        prospect of death. Her inheritance, therefore, was hers in name only; in
                        reality it was in the hands of her guardians.</p>
                   <p>Of primogeniture or legal preference of one member of the family over the
                        others there, is not the faintest trace. And yet we are told of <hi
                            rend="italic">heredia</hi> remaining in a family for many generations—a
                        state of matters that would have been impossible had every death of a <hi
                            rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> necessarily involved a splitting up of
                        the family estate. It is conceivable that this was sometimes prevented by
                        arrangement amongst the heirs themselves; and the practice of every, now and
                        then drafting the younger members of families to colonies diminished the
                        number of those who had a claim to participate. But the simplest plan of
                        avoiding the difficulty was for the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> to
                        regulate his succession by testament; and this was probably had recourse to,
                        not so much for instituting a stranger heir when a man had no
                        issue—according to patrician notions his duty, then was to perpetuate his
                        family by adopting a son—as for partitioning the succession when he had more
                        children than one.</p>
                   <p>There were two sorts of testaments made use of by the patricians of the
                        regal period—that made in the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> of the curies
                            <hi rend="italic">(test, calatis comitiis)</hi> and that made in the
                        presence of the army (probably represented for this purpose by a few
                        comrades) on the eve of battle <hi rend="italic">(test, in procinctu
                            factum).</hi> The first at least—and the second was just a substitute
                        for it on an emergency—was far from being an independent exercise of the
                        testator’s <hi rend="italic">voluntas.</hi> For, though in course of time,
                        and under the sanction of the <hi rend="italic">uti legassit ita jus
                            ¿sto</hi> of the XII. Tables, the curieS may have become merely the
                        recipients of the oral declaration by the testator of his last will, in
                        order that they might testify to it after his death, it is impossible not to
                        see in the comitial testament what must originally have been a legislative
                        act, whereby the testator’s peers, for reasons which they and the presiding
                        pontiffs thought sufficient, sanctioned in the particular case a departure
                        from the ordinary rules of succession. The pontiffs were there to protect
                        the interests of religion, and the curies to protect those of the testator’s
                            <hi rend="italic">gen$\</hi> and it is hardly conceivable that a
                        testament could have been sanctioned by them which so far set at nought old
                        traditions as to deprive a <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias of</hi> his
                        birthright, at least in favour of a stranger.</p>

                   <p>It may safely be assumed that by custom at all events the children of a
                        plebeian usually took his estate on his death intestate. But, as he was not
                        a member of a <hi rend="italic">gens,</hi> there was no provision for the
                        devolution of his succession on failure of children. The want of them he
                        could not supply by adrogation, as he had for long, it is thought, no access
                        to the assembly of the curies; and it is doubtful if adoption of a <hi
                            rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> was known before the XII. Tables. If
                        therefore, as seems probable, the XII. Tables first introduced the
                        succession of agnates, a plebeian unsurvived by children was necessarily
                        heirless, that is to say, heirless in law. But custom seems to have looked
                        without disfavour on the appropriation of his <hi rend="italic"
                            >heredium</hi> by an outsider: a brother or other near kinsman would
                        naturally have the earliest opportunity, and, if he maintained his
                        possession of it in the character of heir for a reasonable period, fixed by
                        the XII. Tables at a year, the law dealt with him as heir, and in course of
                        time the pontiffs imposed upon him the duty of maintaining the family <hi
                            rend="italic">sacra.</hi> This was probably the origin, and a very
                        innocent and laudable one, of the <hi rend="italic">usttcapio pro
                            herede,</hi> which Gaius condemns as an infamous institution, and which
                        undoubtedly lost some of its <hi rend="italic">raison d’etre</hi> once the
                        right of succession of</p>
                   <p>agnates had been introduced.</p>
                   <p>There is no trace of testamentary succession among the <hi rend="italic"
                            >plebs</hi> prior to the Servian constitution, nor is it in the least
                        degree likely that there was any such. Primitive communities are slow to
                        realize the conception of private testaments, and the plebeians could not at
                        this period make a public one either <hi rend="italic">calatis comitiis</hi>
                        or <hi rend="italic">in procinctu.</hi> But not long after their admission
                        to citizenship there is reason to conjecture that mancipation was employed
                        by them, not indeed to make a testament instituting an heir and taking
                        effect only on the testator’s death, but to make a conveyance of a whole
                        patrimony <hi rend="italic">mortis causa.</hi> The transaction took the form
                        of an absolute acquisition, in exchange for a price (usually nominal), of

                        be a misapplication of language. It would be going too far to say, however,
                        as is sometimes done, that before the time of Servius Rome had no conception
                        of contract; for men must have bought and sold, or at least bartered, from
                        earliest times—must have rented houses, hired labour, made loans, carried
                        goods and been parties to a variety of other transactions inevitable amongst
                        a people engaged to any extent in pastoral, agricultural or trading
                        pursuits. It is true that a patrician family with a good establishment of
                        clients and slaves had within itself ample machinery for supplying its
                        ordinary wants, and was thus to a great extent independent of outside aid.
                        But there were not many such families. There must therefore have been
                        contracts and some customary rules to regulate them, though these were
                        presumably very imperfect. In many cases, such as those alluded to, one of

                        resulting from a contract of pledge, for the law as yet recognized none, but
                        because, in retaining it after the purpose was served for which he had
                        received it, he was committing theft and liable to its punishment. At this
                        stage breach of contract, as such, does not seem to have founded any action
                        for damages or reparation before the tribunals; but it is not improbable
                        that, where actual loss had been sustained, the injured party was permitted
                        to resort immediately to self-redress by seizure of the wrong-doer or his
                        goods. Self-help was according to the spirit of the time —not self-defence
                        merely in presence of imminent danger, but active measures for redress of
                        wrongs already completed.</p>
                   <p>There was one contract, however, notorious in after years under the name of
                            <hi rend="italic">nexum,</hi> that must have received legal sanction
                        soon after the Servian reforms, though probably, like mancipation of
                        property itself, known in practice earlier. In the XII. Tables it is
                        apparently referred to as an existing institution. In its normal character
                        it was a loan of money, or rather of the raw copper that as yet was all that
                        stood, for money. How far in its original use it was accompanied by any
                        formalities beyond the weighing of it in a pair of scales (which was rather
                        substance than form) we know not; and what right it conferred on the
                        creditor over his debtor who failed to repay can be only matter of
                        speculation. Apparently the result of the Servian reforms was the regulating
                        and ensuring the publicity of the contract and making the creditor's right
                        of self-redress by apprehension <hi rend="italic">(manus injectio)</hi> and
                        imprisonment, &amp;c., of his debtor conditional on the observance of

                        character and effects, however, of this the earliest independent contract of

                            vengeance was taken. </note> The remarkable thing in Rome is that
                        private vengeance should so long not only have left its traces but continued
                        to be an active power. According to tradition it was an admitted right of
                        the gens or kinsmen of a murdered man in the days of Numa; a law of his is
                        said to have provided that, where a homicide was due to misadventure, the
                        offering to them of a ram should stay their hands <hi rend="italic"
                            >{supra,</hi> p. 533). And this seems to have been also prescribed in
                        the XII. Tables (VIII., 24). To avenge the death of a kinsman was more than
                        a right: it was a religious duty, for his <hi rend="italic">manes</hi> had
                        to be appeased; and so strongly was this idea entertained that, even long
                        after the state had interfered and made murder a matter of public
                        prosecution, a kinsman was so imperatively bound to set it in motion that if
                        he failed he was not permitted to take anything of the inheritance of the
                        deceased. The talion we read of in the XII. Tables is also redolent of the
                            <hi rend="italic">vindicta privata,</hi> although practically it had
                        become no more than a means of enforcing reparation. And even the nexal

                            >{infra,</hi> p. 551), which was not abolished until the 5th century of
                        the city, may not unfittingly, in view of the cruelties that too often
                        attended it, be said to have savoured more of private vengeance than either
                        punishment or procedure in reparation.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Expiatio, supplicium, sacratio capitis,</hi> all suggest
                        offences against the gods rather than against either an individual or the
                        state. But it is difficult to draw the line between different classes of
                        offences, and predicate of one that it was a .sin, of another that it was a
                        crime and of a third that it was but civil injury. They ran into each other
                        in a way that is somewhat perplexing. Apparently the majority of those
                        specially mentioned in the so-called <hi rend="italic">leges regiae</hi> and
                        other records of the regal period were regarded as violations of divine law,
                        and the punishments appropriate to them determined upon that footing. Yet in
                        many of them the prosecution was left to the state or to private
                        individuals. It is not clear, indeed, that there was any machinery for
                        public prosecution except in treason and murder— the former because it was
                        essentially a state offence, the latter because it was comparatively early
                        deemed expedient to repress the blood-feud, which was apt to lead to
                        deplorable results when clansmen and neighbours appeared to defend the
                        alleged assassin.</p>
                   <p>Take some of those offences whose sanction was <hi rend="italic">sacratio
                            capitis.</hi> Breach of duty resulting from the fiduciary relation
                        between patron and client, maltreatment of a parent by his child, exposure
                        or killing of a child by its father contrary to the Romulian rules, the
                        ploughing up or removal of a boundary stone, the slaughter of a plough-ox—
                        all these were capital offences; the offender, by the formula <hi
                            rend="italic">sacer esto,</hi> was devoted to the infernal gods. Festus
                        says that, although the rules of divine law did not allow that he should be
                        offered as a sacrifice to the deity he had especially offended <hi
                            rend="italic">{nec fas est eum immolari),</hi> yet he was so utterly
                        beyond the pale of the law and its protection that any one might kill him
                        with impunity. But, as the <hi rend="italic">sacratio</hi> was usually
                        coupled with forfeiture of the offender’s estate or part of it to religious
                        uses, it is probable that steps were taken to have the outlawry or
                        excommunication judicially declared, though whether by the pontiffs, the
                        king or the curies does not appear; such a. declaration would, besides,
                        relieve the private avenger of the incensed god of the chance of future
                        question as to whether or not the citizen he had slain was <hi rend="italic"
                            >sacer</hi> in the eye of the law.</p>
                   <p>That there must have been other wrongful acts that were regarded in early
                        Rome as deserving of punishment or penalty of some sort, besides those
                        visited with death, sacration or forfeiture of estate, total or partial,
                        cannot be doubted; no community has ever been so happy as to know nothing of
                        thefts, robberies and assaults. The XII. Tables contained numerous
                        provisions in reference to them; but it is extremely probable that, down at
                        least to the time of Servius Tullius, the manner of dealing with them rested
                        on custom, and was in the main self-redress, restrained by the intervention
                        of the king when it appeared to him that the injured party was going beyond
                        the bounds of fair reprisal, and frequently bought off with a composition.
                        When the offence was strictly within the family or the <hi rend="italic"
                            >gens,</hi> it was for those who exercised jurisdiction over those
                        bodies to judge of the wrong and prescribe and enforce the penalty.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Jurisdiction and Procedure.</hi> —Of the course of
                        justice, whether in criminal or civil matters, during the regal period we
                        know little that can.be relied on. Ancient writers speak of the king as
                        having been generally supreme in both. But this can be accepted only with
                        considerable reservation. For the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> ,
                        aided by a council in cases of importance, was judge within the family—his
                        jurisdiction sometimes excluding that of the state, at other times
                        concurring with it, and not to be stayed even by an acquittal pronounced by
                        it. He alone was competent in any charge against a member of tnc family for
                        a crime or. offence against the domestic order—adultery or unchastity of
                        wife or daughter, undutiful behaviour of children or clients, or the like.
                        Death, slavery, banishment, expulsion from the family, imprisonment, chains,
                        stripes, withdrawal of <hi rend="italic">pecutium,</hi> were all at his
                        command as punishments; and it may readily be assumed that in imposing them
                        he was freer to take account of moral guilt than an outside tribunal. The
                        indications of criminal jurisdiction on the part of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >gens</hi> are slight; but its organization was such that it is
                        difficult not to believe that it must occasionally have been called on to
                        exercise such functions. And it must not be* lost sight of that, as.murder
                        seems to have been the only crime in regard to which private revenge was
                        absolutely excluded, the judicial office of the kings must have been,
                        considerably lightened, public opinion approving and not condemning
                        self-redress so long as it was kept within the limits set by usage and
                        custom.</p>
                   <p>The boundary between civil and criminal jurisdiction, if it existed at all,
                        was extremely shadowy. Theft and robbery, for example, if one may conclude
                        from the position they held in the later jurisprudence, were regarded not as
                        public but as private wrongs; and yet when a thief was caught in the act of
                        theft by night he might be slain, and when by day might be scourged and
                        thereafter sold as a slave. But in both cases it may also be assumed that a
                        practice, afterwards formally sanctioned by the XII. Tables—that of the
                        thief compounding for his life or freedom—was early admitted, and the right
                        of self-redress thus made much more beneficial to the party wronged than
                        when nothing was attained but vengeance on the wrongdoer. In assaults,
                        non-manifest thefts, and other minor wrongs, self-interest would in like
                        manner soon lead to the general adoption of the practice of compounding;
                        what was originally, a matter of option in time came to be regarded as a
                        right; and with it there would be occasional difficulty in settling the
                        amount of the composition, and consequent necessity of an appeal to a third
                        party. Here seems to be the origin of the king’s jurisdiction in matters of
                        this sort. He was the natural person to whom to refer such a dispute; for he
                        alone, as supreme magistrate, had the power to use coercion to prevent the
                        party wronged insisting on his right of self-redress, in face of a tender by
                        the wrongdoer of what had been declared to be sufficient reparation. But
                        that self-redress was not stayed if the reparation found due was withheld;
                        as the party wronged was still entitled at a much later period to wreak his
                        vengeance upon the wrongdoer by apprehending and imprisoning him, it cannot
                        reasonably be doubted that such also was the practice of the regal period.</p>
                   <p>How far the kings exercised jurisdiction in questions of quiritarian right,
                        such as disputes about property or inheritance, is by no means obvious.
                        Within the family, of course, such questions were impossible, though between
                        clansmen they may have been settled by the gews.or its chief. The words of
                        style used in the sacramental real action <hi rend="italic">{infra,</hi> p.
                        548) suggest that there must have been a time, when the spear was the
                        arbiter, and when the contending parties, backed possibly by their clansmen
                        or friends, were actual combatants, and victory’ decided the right. Such a
                        procedure could not long survive the institution of a state. In Rome there
                        seems to have been very early substituted for it what from its general
                        complexion one would infer was a submission of the question of right to the
                        pontiffs as the repositories of legal lore. Their proper functions, however,
                        being sacred, they had to bring what was a question of purely civil right
                        within their jurisdiction, by engrafting on it a sacral element, viz. by
                        requiring each of the parties to make oath to the verity of his contention;
                        and the point that in form they decided was which of the two oaths was false
                        and therefore to be made atonement for. In substance, however, it was a
                        finding on the real question at issue; and the party in whose favour it was
                        pronounced was free to make it effectual if necessary by self-redress in the
                        ordinary way.</p>
                   <p>Of Servius, Dionysius says—using, as he often does, language more
                        appropriate to the republican than to the regal period—that he drew a line
                        of separation between public and private judicial processes, and that, while
                        he retained the former in his own hands, he referred the latter to private
                        judges, and regulated the procedure to be followed in causes brought before

                        is often referred to by Cicero, and the range of its jurisdiction in his
                        time seems to have included every possible question of <hi rend="italic"
                            >manus</hi> in the old sense of the word— status of individuals,
                        property and its casements, and inheritance whether testate or intestate.
                        By. the time of Gaius the only matters apparently that were in practice
                        brought before it were questions of inheritance by the <hi rend="italic">jus

                            >Centumviri</hi> formed a quasi-corporate body of private judges
                        selected originally from the tribes (afterwards from the ordinary list of

                        writers identify the centumviral court with the omulian senate of ioo;
                        others attribute its institution to Servius Tullius and hold that it was a
                        plebeian court at first; others make it contemporaneous with the All.
                        Tables; others bring it down to the 6th century of the city; while the
                        weight of recent authority is in favour of the view that it is not earlier
                        than the beginning of the 7th century.. The arguments in support of these
                        several views cannot be gone into here. It is enough to say that we have no
                        positive proof of its existence earlier than the 7th century, though
                        presumptions are in favour of its having been somewhat earlier. In the
                        exercise of their office the <hi rend="italic">Centumviri</hi> acted more
                        independently than private judices ventured to do, and even introduced some
                        considerable reforms into the law.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic"/> These decemvirs in historic times constituted a
                        quasi-corporate body of judicial magistrates, whose duty it was to try
                        certain kinds of actions, especially those relating to personal liberty.
                        During the Princi-pate, while ceasing to. act as a separate court, they
                        presided over the divisions into which the centumviral court had been under
                        Augustus divided. Their origin is quite unknown. Pom-poni.us indeed says
                        that they were originally created soon after the institution of the peregrin
                        praetorship in 242 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> for this very purpose of

                        generally discredited and, if true, their practice of so presiding must
                        quickly have gone into disuse. Those writers who attempt to trace back the

                        to have been a purely plebeian court which early went into desuetude, and
                        there is really no evidence of identity.</p>
                   <p>So far back as historic evidence goes we find that actions were tried and
                        judgments pronounced by <hi rend="italic">judices</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >arbitri.</hi> There never was more than a single judge <hi

                        appointed to try a case, but there might be more than one arbiter, and
                        frequently there were three. All kinds of actions, even a sacramental action
                            <hi rend="italic">in rem,</hi> could be brought before the <hi
                            rend="italic">unus judex,</hi> but especially appropriate to him were
                        all personal claims of alleged indebtedness, whether arising out of a legal
                        or illegal act, denied either <hi rend="italic">in toto</hi> or only as to
                        the amount. Matters of that sort involved as a rule no general principle of
                        law but rather mere disputes as to facts, which could well be decided by a.
                        single individual. There is much more reason for crediting Servius with the
                        institution of the single judge (the arbiters may have been a creation of
                        the Xll. Tables) than with either of the collegiate courts. If we believe
                        that in the early regal period the king acting with the pontiffs kept all
                        jurisdiction in his own hands, it is plain that this must have become a
                        practical impossibility after the admission of the plebeians to citizenship.
                        For the trial of disputed facts it would be necessary to delegate
                        jurisdiction, and the earliest <hi rend="italic">judices</hi> may have been
                        the king’s commissioners for such cases. If this be right, it was the
                        beginning of a system that bore wondrous fruit in after years, and that, as
                        will be shown in the sequel, helped the praetors to build up, through <hi

                   <p>Under the kings it is not improbable that several of the <hi rend="italic"

                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Jus Civile contrasted with Jus Quiritium.—</hi> The term
                            <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> as used to designate this chapter,
                        though almost synonymous with, may be taken as somewhat more comprehensive
                        than, <hi rend="italic">jus Quiritium.</hi> It is a term of later origin
                        than the latter. <hi rend="italic">Jus Quiritium</hi> was based entirely on
                        old custom and legislation, finding, one might say, its culmination in the
                        XII. Tables; whereas in the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> as here
                        understood, there appears the element of doctrinal interpretation of both
                        statute and custom—the magistrates and jurists (particularly the pontiffs)
                        adding much to the earlier law by introducing into it this element. We can
                        say that the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> in this sense is <hi
                            rend="italic">jus Quiritium</hi> as developed by interpretation. It is
                        as yet, however, little influenced, as was the more comprehensive <hi
                            rend="italic">jus civile</hi> of later periods, by the elements of <hi
                            rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> and equity. Still : nowhere, we must
                        note, are the terms <hi rend="italic">jus Quiritium</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">jus civile</hi> placed in contrast by the jurists; they
                        were each <hi rend="italic">jus proprium civium Romanorum.</hi> In the
                        classical law the term <hi rend="italic">jus Quiritium</hi> seems to be used
                        principally in formulae framed in accordance with old custom.</p>
                   <p>Though our information regarding the present period is less legendary than
                        that of the kings, it is still far from being completely authentic, as no
                        original documents belonging to it are extant. There is little dispute among
                        critics that Rome was sacked and burned by the Gauls about 387 b.c. or a few
                        years later, and it is probable that the original pontifical annals <hi
                            rend="italic">(annates maximi)</hi> upon which Livy and other Roman
                        historians have presumably based their narratives of early history were
                        destroyed at that time along with all other written records. What credence,
                        then, we may give to the ancient historical narratives, for the period of
                        the Republic antecedent to this event, depends largely upon how far the
                        pontífices managed to have their lost records restored. In any case,
                        however, there is sufficient presumptive evidence to warrant belief in such
                        prominent events of the early Republic as the creation of two annually
                        elected patrician consuls, with <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> similar to
                        that of the kings, the creation of tribunes of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >plebs,</hi> the enactment of the decemviral code, and periodic
                        struggles between patricians and <hi rend="italic">plebs,</hi> the one to
                        keep and the other to gain political power. To know the exact dates of these
                        events is relatively of little importance.</p>

                        and about the same time plebeian <hi rend="italic">aediles</hi> and <hi

                        their right to participate in its occupation by one of the Licinian laws of
                        367 B.c. The long course of cruel oppression of insolvents (mainly
                        plebeians) by their patrician creditors was put an end to by the Poetilian
                        law about 326 b.c., depriving nexal contract of its privileges and generally
                        prohibiting the use of chains and fetters on persons incarcerated for purely
                        civil debt. By the Hortensian law of about 287 b.c. plebiscita w <hi

                        And from 421 b.c., when one of their number first reached the regular state
                        magistracy as quaestor, down to 252 b.c., when one was elected <hi
                            rend="italic">pontifex maximus,</hi> the plebeians gradually vindicated
                        their right as citizens to share in all the honours of the state. There is
                        also evidence that plebeians were early in the Republic admitted to the
                        senate and also to the <hi rend="italic">comitia euriata.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>The legislative bodies during the present period were thus three in number:
                        the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> of the centuries, the <hi rend="italic"
                            >concilium plebis</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa.</hi>
                        As to the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> of the curies, it seems to have
                        hardly concerned itself with general legislation, but met merely to confer
                            <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> on the higher magistrates and to
                        sanction testaments and adrogations of the gentiles. The legislation of the
                        centuries dealt for the most part (though the XII. Tables were enacted by
                        it) with questions affecting public and constitutional rather than private
                        interests. It could be convened only by a magistrate having military <hi

                        reason that it was theoretically a military assembly met for civil purposes

                        and ill-adapted for legislation. As to the relation of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >concilium plebis</hi> to the <hi rend="italic">comitia tributa</hi>
                        there is much controversy. The old opinion which identified them is now
                        generally abandoned. According to Mommsen <note anchored="true"

                        following points: (1) The <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> was an assembly of
                        the whole people voting in tribes instead of centuries, while the <hi
                            rend="italic">concilium</hi> was an assembly of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >plebs</hi> alone; (2) the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> was always
                        convoked and presided over by a patrician magistrate (often the praetor),
                        while the <hi rend="italic">conciliitm</hi> had to be convoked and presided
                        over by a plebeian official (usually a tribune); (3) in the <hi
                            rend="italic">comitia</hi> auspices had to be taken beforehand, but not
                        in the <hi rend="italic">concilium-</hi> (4) an enactment of the <hi
                            rend="italic">comitia</hi> was a <hi rend="italic">lex</hi> binding on
                        all the <hi rend="italic">populus,</hi> while an enactment of the <hi

                        view that plebiscita were not binding on the whole <hi rend="italic"
                            >populus</hi> prior to the <hi rend="italic">lex Horlensia,</hi> without
                        disregarding distinct statements of Livy as to the <hi rend="italic">lex

                        assemblies to each other may have been originally, it is certain that the
                        Hortensian law equalized them so far as their effects were concerned, and,
                        looking to the small number of patricians compared with the <hi

                        in which assembly the vote was taken. The greater part of the legislation
                        dealing with the private law in the later Republic consisted of plebiscita.</p>

                        against the administration of justice. They complained that they were kept
                        in ignorance of the laws, and that in particular the consuls used their
                        magisterial punitive powers <hi rend="italic">(cocrcitio)</hi> unfairly and
                        with undue severity when a plebeian was the object of them. The state of
                        matters gradually became so intolerable that in the year 462 B.c., according
                        to the ancient tradition, a proposal for a statute was made by C.
                        Terentilius Arsa, one of the tribunes, by which a commission should be
                        appointed to draw up a code of laws in writing. He carried a rogation in the
                            <hi rend="italic">concilium plebis</hi> to this effect. The senate at
                        first strenuously resisted, but after a few years was induced to give way,
                        and its assent to the proposal w <hi rend="sup">T</hi> as obtained.</p>
                   <p>Tradition records that the first practical step towards its realization was
                        the despatch of a mission to Athens, to study the laws of Solon and collect
                        any materials that might be of service in preparing the projected code.</p>
                   <p>On the return of the commissioners in 452 b.c. all the magistracies were
                        suspended, and a body of ten patricians, called <hi rend="italic">decemviri
                            legibus scribundis,</hi> was appointed with consular powers, under the
                        presidency of Appius Claudius, for the express purpose of putting the laws
                        into shape. Before the end of the ensuing year (451) the bulk of the code
                        was ready and was at once passed into law by the <hi rend="italic"
                            >comitia</hi> of the centuries and published on ten tables (whether of
                        brass or wood is doubtful), which were set up in the Forum. Next year, owing
                        to additions being found necessary, the dccemvirate was renewed, with,
                        however, a change of membership (some plebeians being chosen), and in the
                        course of a few months it had completed the supplemental matter. On the
                        downfall of the decemvirate, these new laws, after being duly accepted by
                        the <hi rend="italic">comitia,</hi> were published on two other tables, thus
                        bringing the number up to twelve. The code then received the official name
                        of <hi rend="italic">Lex XII. Tabularum.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>The foregoing account of the enactment of the Tables is an attempt to
                        summarize what is stated by Livy and other Roman writers on the subject.
                        Though inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory about details, these
                        writers are on the main facts in concordance. Until a few years ago, the
                        fact of the publication of such a code about the date above given bad been
                        accepted by modern historians, even the most iconoclastic, without question;
                        unlike the <hi rend="italic">leges regiae,</hi> the XII. Tables had always
                        been regarded as authentic. But in his <hi rend="italic">History of
                            Rome,</hi> published in 1898, Professor Pais of Turin <note
                            anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="52"> Pais, <hi
                                rend="italic">Storia di Roma</hi> (Turin,, i. 566 seq. </note>
                        emitted the view that the decemviral code was really a private compilation
                        made about the year 304B.C. by Cn. Flavius, the scribe of Appius Claudius
                        the censor, and probably at the latter’s instigation; or, in other words,
                        that it was just the so-called <hi rend="italic">Jus Flavianum</hi> which
                        all writers had hitherto regarded as a work dealing with the styles of <hi
                            rend="italic">legis aciiones</hi> and the calendar of court days. In
                        Pais’s view the annalists, in accordance with a habit of theirs, duplicated
                        the same event by counterfeiting an earlier Appius Claudius, &amp;c., in
                        order to magnify the antiquity and authority of the laws collected by
                        Flavius, while the whole account of the decemviral legislation was invented
                        by them. More recently Professor Lambert of Lyons has attempted by similar
                        arguments to prove that the XII. Tables were a private compilation of
                        customs already in observance, and of sacerdotal and other rules already in
                        circulation, made about 197 b.c. by the jurist Aelius Paetus, and were in
                        fact identical with the <hi rend="italic">Tripcrtita</hi> or ./«s <hi

                   <p>There were provisions in the Tables that were almost literal renderings from
                        the legislation of Solon; and others bore a remarkable correspondence to
                        laws in observance in Greece, but they may have been only indirectly

                        far the greater proportion of them, however, were native and original,—not

                        customary, law, for, notwithstanding Livy’s eulogium of them as the “
                        fountain of the whole law,.both private and public,” it seems clear that
                        many branches of it were dealt with in the Tables only incidentally, or with
                        reference to some point of detail. The institutions of the family, the
                        fundamental rules of succession, the solemnities of such formal acts as
                        mancipation, <hi rend="italic">nexum,</hi> and testaments, the main features
                        of the order of judicial procedure, and so forth,—of all of these.a general
                        knowledge was presumed, and the decemvirs thought it unnecessary to define
                        them. What they had to do was to make the law. equal for all, to remove
                        every chance of arbitrary dealing by distinct specification of penalties and
                        precise declaration of the circumstances under which rights should be held
                        to have arisen or been lost, and to make sucn amendments as were necessary
                        to meet the complaints of the plebeians and prevent their oppression in the
                        name of justice. Probably very little of the customary law, therefore, was
                        introduced into the Tables, that was already universally recognized, and not
                        complained of as either unequal, defective or oppressive. Only one or two of
                        the laws ascribed to the kings (assuming their greater antiquity) reappeared
                        in them; yet the omission of the rest did not mean their repeal or imply
                        denial of their validity, for a few of them continued still in force during
                        the Empire, and are founded on by Justinian in his <hi rend="italic"

                        Republic anterior to the Tables embodied in them, although for long
                        afterwards many a man had to submit to prosecution under these laws and to
                        suffer</p>
                   <p>the penalties they imposed.</p>
                   <p>The original Tables are said to have been destroyed when Rome was sacked and
                        burned by the Gauls. But they were probably at once reproduced, and
                        transcripts of them in more or less modernized language must have been
                        abundant if, as Cicero says was still the case in his youth, the children
                        were required to commit them to memory as an ordinary school task. This
                        renders all the more extraordinary the fact that the remains of them are so
                        fragmentary and their genuineness in many cases so debateable. They were
                        embodied, as above mentioned, in the <hi rend="italic">Tripertita</hi> of.

                        writers took their contents. They must have formed the basis of all the

                        amongst them by M. Antistius Labeo in the early years of the Empire, and by
                        Gaius, probably in the reign of Antoninus Pius. Yet a couple of score or so
                        are all that can be collected of their provisions in what profess to be the
                            <hi rend="italic">ipsissima verba</hi> of the Tables, though in a form
                        in most cases more modern than what we encounter in other remains of archaic
                        Latin of the 4th century of the city. These are contained principally in the
                        writings of Cicero, the <hi rend="italic">Nodes Atticae</hi> of Aulus
                        Gellius, and the treatise <hi rend="italic">De verborum signification#</hi>
                        of Festus; the two latter dealing with them.rather as matters of antiquarian
                        curiosity than as rules of positive law. There are also many allusions to
                        particular provisions in the pages of Cicero, -Varro, Gellius and the elder
                        Pliny, as well as in those of Gaius, Paul, Ulpian and other ante-Justinian
                        jurists; but these are not to be implicitly relied on, as we have evidence
                        that they frequently represent the (sometimes divergent) glosses of the
                        interpreters rather than the actual provisions of the statute.

                        fraudulent misrepresentations; the decemvirs admitted no exceptions,
                        preferring a hard-and-fast rule to any qualifications that might cause
                        uncertainty. The system as a whole is one <hi rend="italic">oi jus</hi> as

                        criminal, is prominent. Hanging and beheading, flogging to death, burning at
                        the stake, throwing from the Tarpeian rock,—such are secular penalties that
                        are met with in the Tables; but often, though not invariably, the hanging
                        and so forth is at the same time declared a tribute to some deity to whom
                        the goods of the criminal are forfeited <hi rend="italic">(consecratio

                        procedure as under the kings, but with the addition of some regulations
                        intended to prevent its abuse. Against a thief taken in the act the same
                        procedure seems to have been sanctioned; it w <hi rend="sup">T</hi> as
                        lawful to kill him.on the spofif the theft was nocturnal, or even when it
                        was committed during the day if he used arms in resisting his apprehension.
                        According to Cicero there was a provision in these words: “ si telum manu
                        fugit magis quam jecit, arietem subicito this is perhaps just a re-enactment
                        in illustrative language of the law attributed to Numa, that for homicide by
                        misadventure— “ if the weapon have sped from the hand rather than been aimed
                        ”— a ram was to be tendered as a peace-offering to the kinsmen of him who
                        had been slain. The original purpose must have been to stay the blood
                        revenge, but in the Tables it can only have been intended to stay the
                        prosecution .which it was incumbent on the kinsmen of a murdered.man to
                        institute. So with talionic penalties: “si membrum rupit ni cum eo pacit,
                        talio esto ”—such, according to Gellius, were the words of one of the laws
                        of the Tables, and they undoubtedly recognize talion, an eye for an eye, a
                        tooth for a tooth while at the same time regulating it by enabling the

                   <p>The structure of the provisions of the Tables was not such as to enable the
                        plain citizen to apply them to concrete cases, or to-know how to claim the
                        benefit of them in the tribunals, without some sort of professional advice.
                        Pomponius states that no sooner was the decemviral legislation published
                        than the necessity was felt for its interpretation, and for the preparation
                        by skilled hands of styles of actions by which its provisions might be made
                        effectual. Both of these duties fell to-the pontiffs as the only persons
                        who, in the state of civilization of the period, were well qualified to give
                        the assistance required; and Pomponius adds that the college annually
                        appointed one of its members to-be the adviser of private parties and of the
                            <hi rend="italic">judiccs</hi> in those matters. The <hi rend="italic"

                        was essentially personal, not territorial. A man enjoyed the benefit of its
                        institutions and of its protection, not because he happened to be within
                        Roman territory, but because he was a citizen,—one of those by whom and for
                        whom its law was established. The theory of the early</p>
                   <p>Romans was that a man sojourning within the bounds of a foreign state was at
                        the mercy of the latter and its citizens, that he himself might be dealt
                        with as a slave, and all that belonged to him appropriated by the first
                        comer; for he was outside the pale of the law. Without some sort of alliance
                        with Rome a stranger had no right to claim protection against maltreatment
                        of his person or attempt to deprive him of his property; and even then,
                        unless he belonged to a state entitled by treaty to the international
                        judicial remedy of <hi rend="italic">recuperatio,</hi> it was by an appeal
                        to the good offices of the supreme magistrate, or through the intervention

                        of many new institutions of a more liberal and less exclusive character than

                        subjection in the family was immaterial, in private life it was the <hi

                        Those subject to him had a more limited personality; and, so far as capacity

                        concerned, it was not inherent in them but derived from their <hi

                   <p>An important consequence of <hi rend="italic">minima capitis deminutio</hi>
                        was that it not only extinguished <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi>
                        where it existed, but severed the bond of agnation between the <hi
                            rend="italic">capite minntus</hi> and all those who had previously been
                        related to him as agnates. There was no longer any right of succession
                        between them on intestacy; their reciprocal prospective rights of tutory
                        were defeated, and the <hi rend="italic">minutio</hi> of either tutor or
                        ward put an end to a subsisting guardianship, assuming always that it was a
                            <hi rend="italic">tutcla legitima</hi> or agnatic <hi rend="italic">cura
                            furiosi.</hi> Very remarkable, yet quite logical, was the doctrine that
                        the <hi rend="italic">minutio</hi> extinguished the claims of creditors of
                        the <hi rend="italic">minntus}</hi> their debtor, the person with whom they
                        had contracted, was civilly dead, and dead without an heir, and therefore
                        there was no one against whom an action of the/ms <hi rend="italic"
                            >civile</hi> could be directed in order to enforce payment. But equity
                        eventually provided a remedy, by</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0540" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0581.jp2"/>
                   <p>giving the creditors a praetorian action in which the <hi rend="italic"
                            >minutio</hi> was held as rescinded, and which the new <hi rend="italic"
                            >paterfamilias</hi> was bound to defend on pain of having to give up all
                        the estate he had acquired through the adrogation or <hi rend="italic">in
                            manunt convcntio.</hi> In other respects also the strict effects of this
                            <hi rend="italic">capitis minutio</hi> were attenuated or done away with
                        by the jurists of the Empire, e.g. as regards' personal servitudes.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">The Law of the Family Relations,—</hi> So far as appears
                        no serious inroad was made by the XII. Tables on the law affecting husband
                        and wife, unless in the recognition of the legality of so-called “ free ”
                        marriages, <hi rend="italic">i.e,</hi> entered into without any solemnity,
                        and not involving that subjection of the wife to the husband <hi
                            rend="italic">(manus)</hi> which was a necessary consequence of the
                        patrician confarreation and plebeian coemption. These latter were left
                        untouched, while on the other hand acquisition of marital <hi rend="italic"
                            >manus</hi> through <hi rend="italic">usus</hi> was fully recognized. As
                        formerly mentioned, it had become a practice with some of the plebeians to
                        tie the marriage bond rather loosely in the first instance, possibly in
                        consequence of objection by the women (as became quite general even among
                        patricians at a later period) to renounce their independence and right to
                        retain their own property and earnings, but more probably because taking a
                        woman to be merely the mother of children <hi rend="italic"
                            >(matriinonium)</hi> had been practically forced upon them before
                        coemption had been introduced as a means of making her a lawful wife, and so
                        they had become in a manner habituated to it. But the idea that, as a man
                        might acquire the ownership of a thing to which his legal title was
                        defective by prolonged possession of it, so he might acquire <hi
                            rend="italic">manus</hi> over the woman with whom he had thus informally
                        united himself by prolonged cohabitation with her as his wife had probably
                        matured and become customary law. The Tables accepted it; all that was
                        needed was to define the conditions under which <hi rend="italic">manus</hi>
                        should be held to have been superinduced, and the wife converted from a
                        doubtful <hi rend="italic">uxor</hi> into a lawful <hi rend="italic">mater
                            familias.</hi> Hence the provision that, if a woman, married neither by
                        confarreation nor coemption, desired to retain her independence, she must
                        each year absent herself for three consecutive nights from her husband’s
                        house <hi rend="italic">(trinoctialis nsurpatio)—</hi> twelve months’
                        uninterrupted cohabitation being required to give him that power over her
                        which would have been created instantly had the marriage been accompanied by
                        either of the recognized solem</p>
                   <p>nities.</p>
                   <p>Amongst the fragments of the Tables so industriously collected there is none
                        that refers to a wife’s marriage portion <hi rend="italic">(dos)</hi> ; but
                        it is hardly conceivable that it was as yet unknown. Justinian says that in
                        ancient times it was regarded as a donation to the husband with his wife,
                        rather than as a separate estate that was to be used by him while the
                        marriage lasted but to revert to her or her representatives on its
                        -dissolution. And it is easy to see that, where there was <hi rend="italic"
                            >manus,</hi> the wife becoming a member of her husband’s family and
                        everything of hers becoming his, such must originally have been its
                        character. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="63"> See
                            Cicero, <hi rend="italic">Top.</hi> iv. 23. </note> But even then, when
                        a man gave his daughter <hi rend="italic">(filiafamilias)—</hi> who could
                        have nothing of her own—in marriage, and promised her husband a portion with
                        her, there must have been.some process of law for compelling him to pay it;
                        and Voigt’s conjecture that an <hi rend="italic">actio dictae dotis</hi> was
                        employed for the purpose has something in its favour. <note anchored="true"

                            from more recent writers. </note> As regards divorce, Cicero alludes
                        vaguely to a provision in the Tables about a man depriving his wife of the
                        house-keys and turning her out of doors, with some such words as “ take what
                        is thine and get thee gone.” This can only refer to free or <hi
                            rend="italic">non-manus</hi> marriages, but even for hand marriages,
                        while repudiations by husbands (but not by wives) were competent, the
                        statement of the historians is that they were few and far between until the
                        6th century of the city, and that, until the same date, any man who turned
                        his wife away, however serious the ground, without the cognition of the
                        family council, was liable to penalties at the hands of the censors. <note

                   <p>Of the two or three provisions of the Tables known to us that affected
                        details of the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas,</hi> which itself was
                        assumed to be so well established by customary law as to need no statutory
                        sanction or definition,, one was in the words “ si pater (familias) ter
                        filium venum duuit, a patre filius liber esto.” This came to be construed by
                        the pontifical lawyers as meaning that so powerful was the bond of the <hi
                            rend="italic">potestas</hi> over a son that it could not be completely
                        loosed until the father had three times gone through the process of
                        fictitious sale by which emancipation was effected. But the conception of
                        the law seems to indicate that its original purpose must have been rather to
                        impose a penalty on the father and confer a benefit on a son <hi
                            rend="italic">in potestate,</hi> by declaring him <hi rend="italic">ipso
                            jure</hi> free from it on a certain event, than to place difficulties in
                        the way of his emancipation. “ If a house-father have thrice sold his son,
                        the latter shall be free from his father.” It reads as if the intention were
                        to rescue the son from what, by its frequent repetition, was suggestive of a
                        total absence of parental affection rather than reluctant obedience to
                        overwhelming necessity. May not its object have been to restrain the
                        practice, which did not wholly disappear even in the late Empire, of men
                        selling their sons or giving them to their creditors in security of
                        loans—such sales or pledges, at the time of the Tables, being effected only
                        by an actual transfer of the child <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram</hi>
                        as a free bondman <hi rend="italic">(in mancipii causa),</hi> accompanied
                        by, in the case of a loan, a pact for reconveyance when the loan was repaid?
                        Whatever its ratio, however, and whatever the earlier practice, it was upon
                        this law that the interpreting pontiffs based the rules for adoptions and
                        emancipations of <hi rend="italic">fttiifamilias,</hi> The usual procedure
                        in adoptions was as follows: The natural'father mancipated his .son to a
                        friend for a nominal price and the latter then manumitted. him, the son
                        thereupon reverting into his father’s <hi rend="italic">potestas.</hi> This
                        was repeated a second time with the same result. After the third sale <hi
                            rend="italic">(patria potestas</hi> being extinguished) the purchaser
                        remancipated to the parent. In the latter’s hands the son was now <hi
                            rend="italic">in causa mancipii,</hi> and so in a position in which he
                        could be permanently transferred to the adopter. This was effected by an <hi
                            rend="italic">in jure cessio,</hi> in which the adopter averred that the
                        child was his <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias,</hi> and in which judgment
                        was at once given in his favour on the natural parent’s admission or tacit
                        acquiescence. A similar method was followed in emancipation of a <hi
                            rend="italic">filius,</hi> except that of course there was no <hi
                            rend="italic">cessio in jure,</hi> but instead thereof the parent
                        manumitted immediately after the reconveyance to him. Neither in adoption
                        nor emancipation, however, was remancipation to the <hi rend="italic"
                            >paterfamilias</hi> essential, though it was usual, and in the case of
                        emancipation carried with it important rights of succession and tutory. For
                        daughters and grandchildren the pontifical jurists by a casuistic
                        interpretation of the said law held one mancipation to be in all cases
                        enough to extinguish the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>The nature of the relation between master and slave, like that of <hi
                            rend="italic">manus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">patria potestas,</hi>
                        seems also to have been too notorious to require exposition in the Tables.
                        We find recorded only two references to it, one dealing with the case of a
                        slave who had a conditional testamentary gift of freedom <hi rend="italic"
                            >(statu liber),</hi> the other with noxal surrender <hi rend="italic"
                            >(noxae deditio).</hi> The provision about noxal surrender was not
                        limited to a slave; it was apparently to the effect that, if a member of a
                        man’s family <hi rend="italic">(familiaris, i.e,a</hi> son of a daughter <hi
                            rend="italic">in potestate</hi> or a slave) committed a theft of, or did
                        mischief to, property belonging to a third party, or*a domestic animal
                        belonging to one man did harm to another, the father of the delinquent
                        child, or the owner of the slave or animal, should either surrender him or
                        it to the person injured or make reparation in damages. In course of time
                        the surrender came to be regarded as a means of avoiding the primary
                        obligation of making reparation. But comparative jurisprudence recognizes in
                        the enactment of the Tables a modified survival of the ancient right of an
                        injured party to have the delinquent <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi> —man,
                        beast or thing—given up to him to wreak his revenge upon it privately, the
                        modification consisting in the alternative of reparation offered to the
                        owner. This noxal surrender, failing reparation, had gone out of use in the
                        case of daughters <hi rend="italic">in potestate</hi> before the time of
                        Gaius, and in the case of sons before that of Justinian; but it was still
                        sanctioned so far as slaves and domestic animals were concerned even in that
                        emperor’s legislation.</p>

                        pupillarity after his decease <hi rend="italic">(tutela),</hi> as well as
                        with that of male members of his family who were <hi rend="italic">sui

                        account for any failure in his administration.</p>
                   <p>But, as this gentile tutory could not be extended to the plebeians, among
                        whom some law of guardianship was as much required as among their
                        fellow-citizens of the higher order, the decemvirs found it expedient to
                        devise a new one of universal application. The Tables contained no express
                        authority for testamentary nomination of tutors to the widow</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0541" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0582.jp2"/>
                   <p>of the testator, or to his pupil children and grown-up unmarried daughters;
                        but such appointment, if unknown previously, was soon held to be justified
                        by a liberal interpretation of the very inclusive provision, “ uti legassit
                        suae rci, ita jus esto.” In the absence of testamentary appointment the
                        nearest male agnates of lawful age were to be tutors. This tutory of agnates
                        was an invention of the decemvirs, just as was the agnates’ right of
                        succession on intestacy. The plebeians had no <hi rend="italic">gentes,</hi>
                        at least until a much later period; so, to make the law equal for all, it
                        was necessary to introduce a new order of heirs and tutors. “ Tutores ... ex
                        lege XII. Tabularum introducuntur</p>
                   <p>. . . agnati ” is the very notable language of Ulpian. And his words are
                        very similar in speaking of their right of succession; for, while he says of
                        testamentary inheritances no more than that they were <hi rend="italic"
                            >confirmed</hi> by the XII. Tables, he explains that the <hi
                            rend="italic">legitimae hcreditates</hi> of agnates and patrons were <hi
                            rend="italic">derived</hi> from them. <note anchored="true"

                            agnatic inheritance from the XII. Tables was specially noticed.by Danz
                            in his <hi rend="italic">Gesch. d. rdm. Rechts</hi> (2nd ed., Leipzig,
                            1871-73), ii. 95, but is generally ignored. </note> The phrases <hi

                        agnation, agnatic inheritance and agnatic tutory; for, though the word <hi
                            rend="italic">legitimus</hi> might be applied to any institution based
                        on statute, yet in the ordinary case it indicated one introduced</p>
                   <p>by the XII. Tables, the law of laws.</p>
                   <p>A man’s agnates, in the strict sense, were those of his collateral</p>
                   <p>kinsmen who were subject to the same <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi>
                        as himself, or would have been had the common ancestor been still alive. A
                        man’s sons and daughters <hi rend="italic">in potestate,</hi> therefore,
                        whether the relationship was by birth or adoption, and his wife <hi
                            rend="italic">in manu</hi> (being <hi rend="italic">filiae loco)</hi>
                        were each other’s agnates. But a wife not <hi rend="italic">in manu</hi> was
                        not their agnate; nor were children who had been emancipated or otherwise
                            <hi rend="italic">capite minuti</hi> the agnates of either their
                        brothers and sisters or their mother <hi rend="italic">in manu.</hi> A man
                        was an agnate of his brother’s children, assuming always that there had been
                        no <hi rend="italic">capitis deminutio</hi> on cither side; but he was not
                        an agnate of his sister’s children, for they were not <hi rend="italic"
                            >cjusdem familiae-.</hi> they were agnates of their father’s family, not
                        of their mother’s. In like manner, and again assuming the absence of <hi
                            rend="italic">minutio capitis,</hi> the children of brothers were each
                        other’s agnates, but not the children of a brother and a sister or of two
                        sisters. Brothers and sisters were agnates of the second degree; a man and
                        his brother’s children were of the third, the children of two brothers <hi
                            rend="italic">(patrueles)</hi> of the fourth, and so on,—it being a
                        condition, however, that the kinship should always result cither from lawful
                        marriage or from adoption in one or other of its forms.</p>
                   <p>When, therefore, a man died leaving pupil male descendants or unmarried
                        female descendants who by his death became <hi rend="italic">sui juris,</hi>
                        they got their brothers of lawful age as their tutors; if he was survived by
                        his wife, and she had been <hi rend="italic">in manu,</hi> her sons, or it
                        might be stepsons, acted for her in the same capacity; in either case they
                        took office as the nearest qualified male agnates. If the widow had no sons
                        or stepsons of full age, and the children consequently no qualified
                        brothers, the tutory devolved on the agnates next in order,— <hi
                            rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the brothers german and consanguinean of the
                        deceased husband and father; for they were agnates of the third degree. And
                        so with agnates of the fourth and remoter degrees. <note anchored="true"
                            place="bottom" type="authorial" n="67"> To determine the degree of
                            propinquity between two persons it was necessary to count the
                            generations upwards from the first to the common ancestor and downwards
                            from him to the second. Consequently brothers were related in the second
                            degree, uncle and nephew in the third, first cousins in the fourth, and
                            so on. </note> Failing agnates who could demonstrate their propinquity,
                        the tutory passed, to the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> when the ward happened
                        to belong to one. This is nowhere expressly stated; but Cicero gives what he
                        represents to be an enactment of the Tables, making the fellow-gentiles of a
                        lunatic his guardians on failure of agnates; and analogy seems to justify
                        the extension of the same rule to the case of sane pupil and female wards.

                        law, as we have seen, there was no technical word for ownership of things:
                        it was an clement of the house-father’s <hi rend="italic">manus.</hi> In
                        time, although it is impossible to say when, the word <hi rend="italic"
                            >dominium</hi> came into use, but, so far as can be discovered, it did
                        not occur in the XII. Tables, and must have been of later introduction. In
                        those days, when a man asserted ownership of a thing, he was content to say,
                        “ It is mine,” or “ It is mine according to the law of the Quirites.” It is
                        said by some jurists of eminence that under the law of
                        the Tables what afterwards came to be called “ dominium ex jure Quiritium ”
                        was competent only in. the case of <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> —of a
                        man’s house and farm, and things appurtenant thereto, as slaves and animals
                        with which he worked them. There is much to be said for this hypothesis, but
                        it is so far contradicted by Ulpian and Paul, who tell us that <hi
                            rend="italic">tigna juncta</hi> (that is, building materials, vine

                        hand, these texts may be explained as mere deductions by interpretation at a
                        later time of the words “ ne solvito ” of the XII. Tables. <note

                        important were mancipation, surrender in court, usucapion and bequest as
                        singular modes, and inheritance, <hi rend="italic">in manum conventio,</hi>
                        adrogation and purchase of a confiscated estate, as universal ones. All of
                        these, with the exception of mancipation, applied equally to <hi
                            rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">res nec

                        things of this class, simple tradition. If the transfer of these was by the
                        owner, with the intention of passing the property, then the simple delivery
                        of possession <hi rend="italic">(traditio)</hi> was enough, unless indeed it
                        was in virtue of a sale; in which latter case the ownership remained with
                        the vendor, notwithstanding the change of possession, until the price was
                        paid or security given for it. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                   <p>Originally mancipation was not the imaginary sale that Gaius speaks of, but
                        as real a sale as could well be conceived—the weighing in .scales., held by
                        an official, of the raw metal that was to be the consideration for the
                        transfer of a <hi rend="italic">res mancipi,</hi> and the handing of it by
                        the transferee to the transferrer, with the declaration that thereby and
                        therewith the thing in question became his in quiritary right. On the
                        introduction of coined money weighing became unnecessary. The price was
                        counted out before the ceremony, or sometimes left to be done afterwards;
                        and though, in that spirit of conservatism that was so marked in the
                        adhesion</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0542" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0583.jp2"/>
                   <p>to tîme-honoured forms after their <hi rend="italic">raison d'être</hi> was
                        gone, the scale-bearer and the scales were still retained as indispensable
                        elements of the mancipation, yet the scales were simply touched by the
                        purchaser with a <hi rend="italic">raudusculum</hi> or a single coin, in
                        order that he might be able to recite the old formula: “ 1 sav that this
                        slave is mine in quiritary right, and that by purchase (for such and such a
                        price) with these scales and this bit of copper.” And that one coin, says
                        Gaius, was then handed by the transferee to the transferrer as if it were in
                        fact the price of the purchase <hi rend="italic">(quasi pretti loco).</hi>
                        Thus transformed, the mancipation was undoubtedly an imaginary sale; for the
                        real price might have been paid weeks or months before, or might not be paid
                        until w <hi rend="sup">ee</hi> ks <hi rend="sup">or</hi> months afterwards.
                        The mancipation had become nothing more than a conveyance, and in this form
                        it continued down to the end of the 3rd century of the Empire to be the
                        appropriate mode of transfer of a <hi rend="italic">res mancipi,</hi> or at
                        least of conferring on the transferee of such a thing a complete legal title
                            <hi rend="italic">(dominium ex jure quiritium).</hi> After that,
                        however, it seems gradually to have gone into disuse, being inapplicable to
                        lands out of Italy that did not enjoy what was called <hi rend="italic">jus
                            Italicum*,</hi> and long before the time of Justinian it had practically
                        disappeared.</p>
                   <p>The effects of a mancipation, provided the price had been paid or security
                        given for it, were that the property passed instantly to the purchaser, and
                        that the transferrer was held to warrant the transferee against eviction
                        from the moment the price was received. In the absence of either payment or
                        sureties for it, the title still remained with the vendor, so that it was in
                        his power, by means of a real action, to get back what had been mancipated,
                        even though it had passed into the possession of the vendee. The vendor’s
                        liability to the vendee in the event of eviction is usually supposed to have
                        arisen <hi rend="italic">ipso jure—</hi> that is to say, without anything
                        expressly said about it; the acceptance by the transferrer of the coin with
                        which the scales had been struck was held to have imposed upon him an
                        obligation to maintain the transferee in possession, under a penalty of
                        double the amount of the price, recoverable bÿ the latter by what is usually
                        called an <hi rend="italic">actio auctoritatis.</hi> But this <hi
                            rend="italic">ipso jure</hi> obligation did not arise when the
                        mancipation was either really or fictitiously gratuitous <hi rend="italic"
                            >(nummo uno),—</hi> really, in the case of donations, &amp;c.,
                        fictitiously, when, on purpose to exclude the warranty, the recital of the
                        transferee was that the price was a single sesterce.</p>
                   <p>The right of a vendee to sue an <hi rend="italic">actio auctoritatis</hi>
                        arose only when eviction resulted from a decree in a regular judicial
                        process at the instance of a third party disputing his title, and was
                        conditional on his having done all that was necessary on his part to bring
                        his vendor <hi rend="italic">(atictor)</hi> into the field to defend his own
                        interests. And the duration of the <hi rend="italic">auctoritas</hi> was
                        limited by the Tables to two years in the case of lands and houses, to one
                        year in the case of other things.. As possession for those periods was
                        sufficient to cure any defect in the vendee’s title, it was but reasonable
                        that with their expiry the vendor’s liability on his warranty should be at
                        an end.</p>
                   <p>By a provision of the Tables in the very inclusive terms, “cum nexum faciet
                        mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto,” the importance of
                        mancipation was immensely increased; for any sort of qualification germane
                        to the transaction might be superinduced upon it, and the range of its
                        application thus greatly extended. Such qualifications were spoken of as <hi
                            rend="italic">leges mancipii,—</hi> self-imposed terms, conditions or
                        qualifications of the conveyance and, as integral parts of the transaction
                            <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram,</hi> they partook of its binding
                        character and were law between the parties. The matter of oral declaration
                        might be the acreage of lands, their freedom from burdens or right to
                        easements, reservation of a usufruct, undertaking to reconvey on a certain
                        event, or what not, so long as it did not express a term or condition; the
                        result was just so many obligations created <hi rend="italic">per aes et
                            libram,</hi> whose contravention or denial (Cicero tells us) was
                        punished with a twofold penalty. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        </note> Ordinarily the words spoken in the hearing of the witnesses fixed
                        the beginning and the end of the liability; it was enough that they .were
                        literally complied with, however much the other party might be injured by
                        something inconsistent with their spirit, or which he had not taken the
                        precaution to require should be made matter of declaration. But there was an
                        exception (although not introduced until long after the Tables) in the case
                        of that particular mancipatory agreement which was known by the name of <hi
                            rend="italic">fiducia,, i.e.</hi> where the mancipation was to a
                        creditor in security or to a friend for safe custody, and the engagement was
                        to return the thing mancipated, in the one case when the debt secured by it
                        was paid and in the other on demand. In such cases the transferee took the
                        conveyance more in the transferrer’s interest than his own; he became a sort
                        of trustee, entitled to be treated with consideration, and neither mulcted
                        in a twofold penalty when his inability to reconvey was due to no fault of
                        his, nor forced to reconvey until relieved of charges incurred by him in
                        reference to</p>
                   <p>the property. Accordingly it became the practice to import into the
                        mancipation a reference to <hi rend="italic">fides—</hi> “ fidi fiduciae
                        causa meum esse aio,” with explanation of the purpose, conditions,
                        &amp;c., of the <hi rend="italic">fiducia,</hi> and this explanation as
                        a rule not in the nuncupatory words, forming a relative <hi rend="italic"
                            >lex mancipii,</hi> but in a separate agreement or <hi rend="italic"
                            >pactum fiduciae.</hi> This pact then became enforceable not by ordinary
                            <hi rend="italic">legis actio,</hi> as part of the mancipation, but
                        separately on grounds of good faith alone. It gave rise to an <hi
                            rend="italic">actio fiduciae</hi> which some writers think was just an
                        application of the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per judicis
                            postulationem,</hi> but which more probably was originally an action <hi

                        principles of good faith. The fiduciary clause had the effect of freeing
                        alike the right of the vendor and the obligation of the vendee from the
                        hard-and-fast lines of the <hi rend="italic">jus strictum,</hi> and

                        was just a <hi rend="italic">rei vindicatio</hi> arrested in its initial
                        stage. The parties, cedent and cessionary, having previously arranged the
                        terms of transfer—sale, donation or otherwise—appeared before the
                        magistrate; the cessionary, taking the position of plaintiff, declared the
                        thing his in quiritary right; tne cedent, as defendant, was asked what he
                        had to say in answer; and, on his admission or silence, the magistrate at
                        once pronounced a decree <hi rend="italic">(addictio)</hi> which completed
                        the transfer, but which might be subject to a fiduciary reservation or
                        deduction of a servitude. It was probably more resorted to for the
                        constitution of servitudes, both real and personal, and transfer of such
                        rights as <hi rend="italic">patria potestas,</hi> €utory-at-law of a woman,
                        or an agnatic inheritance that had already opened, than for conveyance of
                        property. For it was not only inconvenient, inasmuch as it required the
                        parties to appear before the supreme magistrate in Rome, and could not be
                        carried through by any one under power (as mancipation might), but it had
                        also the serious disadvantage that it did not <hi rend="italic">ipso
                            jure</hi> imply any warranty of title by the cedent in the event of
                        eviction or give rise to an action <hi rend="italic">de modo agri.</hi> Nor
                        did it, like mancipation and tradition, make payment of the price a
                        condition precedent of the transfer of property. The reason was that in form
                        the right of the cessionary flowed from the magisterial decree: ‘‘ Since you
                        say the thing is yours, and the cedent does not say it is his, I declare it
                        yours,” and not from any act or word of the cedent’s, who was passive in the
                        matter.</p>

                            <hi rend="italic">(usus)</hi> into quiritary property by efflux of time.
                        The provision in the Tables, as given by Cicero, was to this effect: “ usus
                        auetdritas fundi biennium est, ceterarum rerum omnium annuus est.” The
                        relation in which the words <hi rend="italic">usus</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">auctoritas</hi> stand to each other has been a subject of
                        much discussion: the prevailing opinion amongst modern civilians is that the
                        two words should be taken disjunctively, the first alone referring to
                        usucapion, and the second to the warranty of title incumbent on the vendor
                        in a mancipation, and that both were limited to two years in the case of
                        lands (and, by extensive interpretation, houses), and to one year in the
                        case of anything else. In the later jurisprudence the possession required to
                        be based on a sufficient title and the possessor to be in good faith. But
                        the decemviral code, as is now generally admitted, contained no such
                        requirements; any citizen occupying immovables or holding movables as his
                        own, provided they were usucaptible and he had not taken them theftuously,
                        acquired a quiritary right in two years or one, as the case might be, simply
                        on the strength of his possession. Originally, therefore, it was simply the
                        conversion of <hi rend="italic">de facto</hi> possession, no matter how
                        acquired so long as not by theft, into legal ownership when prolonged for
                        the statutory period,—too often the maintenance of might at the cost of
                        right. But in time it came to be regarded rather as a remedy for some defect
                        of title, arising either from irregularity of conveyance or incapacity of
                        the party from whom a transfer had been taken; and with the progress of</p>

                   <p>The rural servitudes of way and water were no doubt very early recognized,
                        for they ranked as <hi rend="italic">res tnancipi,</hi> and the XII. Tables
                        contained various regulations in reference to the former. Usufruct, too, was
                        probably not unknown; but the urban praedial servitudes bear the impress of
                        a somewhat later jurisprudence. Pignorate and hypothecary rights were
                        certainly unknown as rights protected by action. <note anchored="true"

                            until near the end of the Republic. But Festus (s.v. “Nancitor”; see
                            Bruns, <hi rend="italic">Fontes,</hi> 6th ed., iii. 16) speaks of a
                            provision in the Cassian league between Rome and the Latin states of the
                            year 262 u.c.—“ Si quid pignoris nasciscitur, sibi habeto ”—which may
                            suggest that the Romans at this period were not altogether unacquainted
                            with pledge or pawn of movables as a transaction of some value <hi

                        was the security <hi rend="italic">praedibus praediisque</hi> required by
                        the state from those indebted to it in assurance of their obligations. Here
                        there was the double guarantee of sureties <hi rend="italic">(praedes)</hi>
                        and mortgages of lands of theirs <hi rend="italic">(praedia

                        which stood in the forefront of the provisions of the XII. Tables about
                        inheritance: “uti legassit suae rei, ita jus esto.” Whether resort was to
                        the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> or to the army, the testator’s own will
                        in the matter was henceforth to be supreme. There was to be no more
                        reference to the pontiffs as to the expediency of the testament in view of
                        the interests of the family <hi rend="italic">sacra,</hi> and of creditors
                        of the testator’s; from legislators, sanctioning a departure from the
                        ordinary rules of succession, the assembled Quirites became merely
                        witnesses—recipients of the oral declaration of the testator’s will in
                        regard to his inheritance. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                   <p><hi rend="italic">per aes et</hi> <hi rend="sub">was</hi> originally not a testament but only a makeshift for
                        one. A plebeian was not qualified in the regal period to make a testament in
                        the <hi rend="italic">comitia}</hi> so, instead, he transferred his estate
                        to a friend on whom he could rely, with instructions how to distribute it on
                        his death. The transferee was called <hi rend="italic">familiae emptor,</hi>
                        because the conveyance</p>
                   <p>was in form a mancipation for a nominal price.</p>
                   <p>It is not at all unlikely that the same device may occasionally have been
                        resorted to by a patrician who had neglected to make a regular testament,
                        and was seized with mortal illness before he had an opportunity of appealing
                        to the curies. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="77">
                            The <hi rend="italic">comitia,</hi> Gaius tells us (ii. § 102), met only
                            twice a year to sanction testaments. In Mommsen’s view, <hi
                                rend="italic">Rom. Chronologie</hi> (1859), PP*4i seq., these days
                            were the 24th of March and the 24th of May. </note> But such a
                        disposition was not a testament, and may not have been so called.
                        A.testa-ment was the nomination of a person as the testator’s heir. It made
                        the person instituted as fully the representative of the testator after his
                        death as his heir-at-law would have been had he died</p>
                   <p>intestate. The original <hi rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> mancipation that
                        opened the way for the testament <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram</hi>
                        conferred upon <hi rend="italic">familiae emptor</hi> no such character.
                        Gaius says that he stood in place of an heir <hi rend="italic">(heredis
                            loco),</hi> inasmuch as he had such of an heir’s rights and duties as
                        the <hi rend="italic">familiae venditor</hi> had it in his power to confer
                        and impose; but the transaction was but a conveyance of estate, with a
                        limitation of the right of the grantee. It has been Argued that, as the law
                        did not recognize conditional mancipation, the conveyance must have
                        operated, as a complete and immediate divestiture of the grantee. But this
                        does not follow. For it was quite competent for a man, in transferring
                        property by mancipation, to reserve to himself a life interest; and
                        apparently it was equally competent for him to postpone delivery of
                        possession, without infringing the rule that the mancipation itself could
                        not be <hi rend="italic">ex certo tempore.</hi> So far as one can sec,
                        therefore, there was nothing to prevent the grantor of the conveyance (or
                        quasi-testator) bargaining that he was to retain the possession till his
                        death; and, as the <hi rend="italic">familia</hi> was an aggregate of
                        .estate <hi rend="italic">(univer sitas rerum)</hi> which retained its
                        identity notwithstanding any change in its component elements, he must in
                        such case have been as free to operate on it while he survived, as if he had
                        never conveyed it by mancipation.</p>
                   <p>Cicero incidentally remarks <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                            type="authorial" n="78"> Cic. <hi rend="italic">De Oral.</hi> i. 57, §
                            245. </note> what indeed the nature of the transaction of itself very
                        distinctly suggests—that the true testament with the copper and the scales
                        had its statutory warrant, not in the <hi rend="italic">uti legassit suae
                            ret</hi> of the XII. Tables, but in the provision contained in the
                        words: “ cum nexum faciet mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus
                        esto.” Reflection on the import and comprehensiveness of these words led the
                        pontifical interpreters to the conclusion that there was nothing in them to
                        prevent the direct institution of an heir in the course of the <hi
                            rend="italic">verba muncupata</hi> engrafted on a mancipation. From the
                        moment this view was adopted and put in practice the <hi rend="italic"
                            >familiae mancipatio</hi> ceased to be a transfer of the testator’s
                        estate to the <hi rend="italic">familiae emptor \</hi> the latter’s purchase
                        was now for form’s sake only, though still an indispensable form, since it
                        was it alone that, according to the letter of the statute, imparted efficacy
                        to the <hi rend="italic">nuncupatio.</hi> But it was the <hi rend="italic"
                            >nuncupatio</hi> —the oral declaration addressed to the witnesses— that
                        really contained the testamentary disposition, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>
                        the institution of an heir, with such other provisions as the testator
                        thought fit to embody in it. This was the second stage in the history of the
                        testament <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram.</hi> The third was marked by
                        the introduction of tahlets in which the testamentary provisions were set
                        out in writing, and which the testator displayed to the witnesses, folded
                        and tied up in the usual manner, declaring that they contained the record of
                        his last will.</p>
                   <p>Gaius narrates the words spoken by the <hi rend="italic">familiae
                            emptor</hi> and addressed to the testator as follows: “ Your estate and
                        belongings <hi rend="italic">(familia pecuniaque tua),</hi> be they mine by
                        purchase with this bit of copper and these copper scales, subject to your
                        instructions, but in my keeping, that so you may lawfully make your
                        testament according to the statute <hi rend="italic">(quo lu jure
                            testamentum facere possis secundum legem publicam)."</hi> The meaning of
                        the words “in my keeping <hi rend="italic">(endo custodelam meant)"</hi> is
                        not quite obvious; they are probably remnants of an older style, but may be
                        due to a clerical error of the writer of the Verona MS. Certain it is that
                        they no more imported a real custody than a real property in the <hi
                            rend="italic">familiae emptor}</hi> for the testator remained so
                        entirely master of his estate that the very next day if he pleased he might
                        mancípate it. anew to a different purchaser, and nuncupate fresh
                        testamentary writings. The nuncupation by the testator was in these terms: “
                        As is written in these tablets so do I give, so do I legate, so do I declare
                        my will; therefore, Quirites, grant me your testimony "; and, adds Gaius, “
                        whatever the testator had set down in detail in his testamentary tablets he
                        was regarded as declaring and confirming by this general statement.” To the
                        appeal of the testator the witnesses responded by giving their testimony in
                        words which unfortunately are not preserved; and then the testament was
                        sealed by testator, officials and witnesses, the seals being outside
                        according to the early fashion. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        contemplated by the compilers of the Tables; it was foreign to the
                        traditional conception of the family and the family estate. But it was a
                        right whose concession could not be resisted when claimed as embraced in the

                        notoriously were the <hi rend="italic">sui hcredes</hi> entitled to the
                        first place—and that not so much in the character of heirs as of persons now
                        entering upon the active exercise of rights hitherto existing, though in a
                        manner dormant— that the compilers of the XII. Tables thought it superfluous
                        expressly to declare it. “ If a man die intestate, leaving no <hi
                            rend="italic">suus heres,</hi> his nearest agnate shall have his estate.
                        If the agnate also fail, his gentiles shall have it.” It has been pointed
                        out, in dealing with the tutory of agnates, that the notion of agnation, as
                        a bond distinct from that which connected the gentile members of a clan, was
                        due to the decemvirs. They had to devise a law of intestate tutory and
                        succession suitable alike to the patricians who had <hi rend="italic"
                            >gentes</hi> and to the plebeians who had none. To put the latter in
                        exactly the same position as the former was beyond their power; for the fact
                        had to be faced that the plebeians had no gentile institutions, and to
                        create them was impossible. The difficulty was overcome by accepting the
                        principle of agnation upon which the patrician <hi rend="italic">gens</hi>
                        was constructed, and establishing an agnatic circle of kinsmen (perhaps at
                        first limited to the sixth degree) to which the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi>
                        as a collective body should be postponed in the case of the patricians, and
                        which should come in place of it in the case of the plebeians. It was not
                        perfect equalization, but the nearest approach to it that the circumstances
                        permitted. The difference was that, when the agnates of a plebeian intestate
                        failed, his inheritance was vacant; whereas, on failure of those of a
                        patrician, there was devolution to his <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> in its
                        collective capacity. Two “ interpretations ” put upon the statute had an
                        important bearing in this connexion, viz. (i) that, if the nearest agnates
                        in existence declined the succession, those next in degree were not allowed
                        to take it; and (2) that no female agnate could take it more remote than a
                        sister of the deceased intestate. The division among two or more agnates</p>
                   <p>was always <hi rend="italic">per capita</hi> , not <hi rend="italic">per
                            stirpes.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>The order of intestate succession thus established by the XII. Tables, which
                        prevailed until amended by the praetors probably, in the 8th century of the

                        next to his nearest agnate or agnates, and finally, if the deceased was a

                        who had been emancipated, and so cut off from the family tree, could claim

                        whether in virtue of a testamentary institution or by operation of law on
                        intestacy, at once invested them with the character, rights and
                        responsibilities of heirs. No acceptance was necessary, nor, according to
                        the rules of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> was any declinature
                        competent. They</p>
                   <p>had been all along in a manner joint owners with their parent of the family
                        estate, which by his death had become, nominally at least, an inheritance;
                        and, as he had not thought fit to terminate their interest in it by
                        emancipating or disinheriting them, they were not now allowed to disown it.
                        Hence they were spoken of as necessary heirs <hi rend="italic">(heredes sui
                            et necessarii)..</hi> A slave, too whom his owner had instituted in his
                        testament with gift of liberty was a necessary heir: he could not decline,
                        and was invested with the character of heir the moment the testator died.
                        Not so with stranger institutes or agnates taking on intestacy: they were
                        free to take or reject the inheritance as they saw fit; consequently, an act
                        of acceptance <hi rend="italic">(aditio)</hi> was necessary on their part to
                        make them heirs.</p>
                   <p>This was a formal declaration before witnesses, which got the name of <hi

                            164-173. </note> It was not unusual for a testator, in instituting an
                        heir, to require that he should make a formal declaration of acceptance
                        within a limited time, failing which his right should pass to a substitute,
                        who in turn was required to enter within a certain time; and so on with any
                        number of substitutes, the series ending with one of his slaves, who became
                        heir without entry, and thus saved the testator from the disgrace of <hi
                            rend="italic">post mortem</hi> bankruptcy in the event of the
                        inheritance proving insolvent. The »zi <hi rend="italic">tegassit of</hi>
                        the Tables, as interpreted by the pontiffs, conferred upon a testator very
                        great latitude of testamentary disposition, even to the extent of disherison
                        of <hi rend="italic">sui heredes.</hi> This was a course, however, that was
                        probably rarely resorted to unless when a child had been guilty of gross
                        ingratitude, or when the parent had reason to believe his estate was
                        insolvent and desired to protect his children from the responsibilities of
                        inheritance. Usually his <hi rend="italic">sui,</hi> if he had any, would be
                        his institutes, and the purpose of the testament either to apportion the
                        estate amongst them as he thought expedient, or to give him an opportunity
                        of appointing tutors, bequeathing legacies, or enfranchising slaves. On
                        intestacy the <hi rend="italic">sui</hi> took equally, but <hi rend="italic"
                            >per stirpes*,</hi> that is to say, grandchildren by a son who had
                        predeceased or been emancipated, but who themselves had been retained in
                        their grandfather’s <hi rend="italic">potestas,</hi> took amongst them the
                        share to which their father would otherwise have been entitled, instead of
                        taking equal shares with their surviving uncles. It was by no means unusual,
                        when the whole inheritance descended to sons, for them to hold it in common
                        for many years as quasi partners <hi rend="italic">(consortes)</hi> ; but
                        any one of them was entitled at any moment to claim a partition which was
                        effected judicially, by an arbitral procedure introduced by the XII. Tables,
                        termed <hi rend="italic">a judicium</hi> (or ardi/riww) <hi rend="italic"
                            >familiae erciscundae.</hi> Where two or more strangers were instituted
                        testamentarily, whether to equal or unequal shares, if one of them failed
                        either by predecease or declinature his share accrued <hi rend="italic">ipso
                            jure</hi> to the others; for it was a rule that early became proverbial
                        that a man could not die partly testate and partly intestate. There was the
                        same accrual among agnates on intestacy; and both they and stranger
                        testamentary institutes had the same action for division of the inheritance
                        that was made use of by <hi rend="italic">sui heredes.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>According to Gaius it was as a stimulus to heirs to enter as soon as
                        possible to an. inheritance that had opened to them, and thus make early
                        provision alike for satisfying the claims of creditors of the deceased and
                        attending to his family <hi rend="italic">sacra,</hi> that the law came to
                        recognize the somewhat remarkable institution of usucapion or prescriptive
                        acquisition of the inheritance in the character of heir <hi rend="italic"
                            >(usucapió pro herede).</hi> Such usucapion was impossible—there was no
                        room for it—if the deceased had left <hi rend="italic">sui heredes*,</hi>
                        for the inheritance vested in them the moment he died. But, if there were no
                            <hi rend="italic">sui heredes,</hi> then any person taking possession of
                        the property that had belonged to the deceased, and holding it for twelve
                        months without interruption, thereby acquired it as if he were heir: in
                        fact, according to the views then held, he acquired the inheritance itself.
                        Gaius characterizes it as a dishonest acquisition, inasmuch as the
                        usucapient knew that what he had taken possession of was not his. But, as
                        already explained, the usucapion of the XI1. Tables did not require <hi
                            rend="italic">bona fides</hi> on the part of the uscapient; he might
                        acquire ownership by prolonged possession of what he knew did not belong to
                        him so long as he did not appropriate it theftuously, <hi rend="italic"
                            >i.e.</hi> knowing that it belonged to another. But an inheritance
                        unappropriated by an heir who had nothing more than a right to claim it
                        belonged in strictness to no one; and there was no theft, therefore, when a
                        person took possession of it with a view to usucapion in the character of
                        heir. There can be little doubt that on the completion of his possession he
                        was regarded as heir just as fully as if he had taken under a testament or
                        as heir-at-law on intestacy—that is to say, that he was held responsible to
                        creditors of the deceased and required to charge himself with the family <hi
                            rend="italic">sacra.</hi> Gaius does not say as much; but both the
                        Coruqcanian and the Mucian edict <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                            type="authorial" n="82"> Cic. <hi rend="italic">de leg.</hi> ii. 48, 49.
                        </note> imposed the latter burden upon him who had usucapted by possession
                        the greater part of a deceased person’s estate; and it is but reasonable to
                        suppose that the burden of debts must in like manner have fallen on the
                        usucapient or usucapients in proportion to the shares they had taken of the
                        deceased’s property.</p>

                   <p>XII. Tables it was different. In them delicts were much more prominent than
                        contracts—wrongs entitling the sufferer to demand the imposition of
                        penalties upon the wrong-doer that in most cases covered both reparation and
                        punishment. The disproportion in the formulated provisions in reference to
                        the two sources of obligation, however, is not surprising. For, first of
                        all, the purpose of the decemviral code was to remove uncertainties and
                        leave as little as possible to the arbitrariness of the magistrates. In
                        nothing was there more scope for this than in the imposition of penalties;
                        and, as different offences required to be differently treated, the
                        provisions in reference to them were necessarily multiplied. In the next
                        place, the intercourse that evokes contract was as yet very limited.
                        Agriculture was the occupation of the great majority; of trade and commerce
                        there was little; coined money had hardly begun to be used as a circulating
                        medium. Lastly, the safeguards of engagement then lay to a great extent in
                        the sworn oath or the plighted faith, of which the law <hi rend="italic"
                            >(jus)</hi> hardly yet took cognisance, but which found a protection
                        quite as potent in the religious and moral sentiments that had so firm a
                        hold on the people.</p>
                   <p>It may be asked—If a man purchased sheep or store cattle, a plough, a toga,
                        a jar of wine or oil, had he no action to compel delivery, the vendor no
                        action for payment of the price? Did the hire of a horse or the loan of a
                        bullock create no obligation? Was partnership unknown, and deposit, and
                        pledge, and suretyship in any other form than that of <hi rend="italic"
                            >vadimoniumt</hi> One can have no hesitation in answering that, as
                        transactions of daily life, they must all have been more or less familiar.
                        It does not follow, however, that they were already regulated by law and
                        protected by the ordinary tribunals. Modern historical jurists are pretty
                        well agreed that not only the real contracts of loan <hi rend="italic"
                            >{mutuum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">commodatum),</hi> deposit, and
                        pledge, but also the consensual ones of sale, location, partnership, and
                        mandate, and the verbal one of suretyship, were as yet barely recognized by
                        law. The law recognized conveyance but hardly contract. Sale was the
                        offspring of barter—of instant exchange of one thing for another. With such
                        instant exchange there was no room for obligation to deliver on either side.
                        The substitution of coined money for the raw metal can hardly have effected
                        any radical change: the ordinary practice of those early times must still
                        have been ready-money transaction—an instant exchange of ware for price; and
                        it can only have been when, for some reason or other, the arrangement was
                        exceptionally for delivery or payment at a future date, say next market day,
                        that obligation was held to have been</p>
                   <p>created. Was that obligation enforceable by the civil tribunals?</p>
                   <p>• Some jurists hold that it was—that at no time were the <hi rend="italic"
                            >jus gentium</hi> contracts outside the protection of judicial remedies,
                        although by a simpler procedure than that resorted to for enforcement of the
                        contracts of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile.</hi> But two provisions in
                        the XII. Tables seem to prove that it was not so enforceable when they were,
                        drawn up. The first is that already referred to as recorded by Justinian—
                        that, where a thing was sold and delivered, the property, nevertheless, was
                        not to pass until the price had been paid or sureties <hi rend="italic"
                            >(vades)</hi> for it accepted by the vendor. Far from being a
                        recognition of the obligatory nature of the transaction, this provision is
                        really a recognition of the inability of the law to enforce payment of the
                        price by the vendee; it is a declaration that, on the latter’s failure to
                        pay, the vendor, unprotected by any personal action, should be entitled to
                        get back the thing sold as still his own, no matter in whose hands he found
                        it. The second related to the case ot a person who had bought a victim for
                        sacrifice, but had failed to pay for it. A real action for its revindication
                        by the seller after it had been consumed on the altar was out of the
                        question; so he was authorized by the Tables, by the process of <hi
                            rend="italic">pignoris capio,</hi> at his own hand to appropriate in
                        satisfaction a sufficient equivalent out of the. belongings of the
                        purchaser, against whom he had no personal action.</p>
                   <p>It was a principle of the law of Rome through the whole of its history,
                        though in course of time subject to an increasing number of exceptions, that
                        mere agreement between two persons did not give him in whose favour it was
                        conceived a right to demand its enforcement. To entitle a man to claim the
                        intervention of the civil tribunals to compel implement of an engagement
                        undertaken by another, it was necessary (subject to those exceptions) either
                        that it should be clothed in some form prescribed or recognized by the law,
                        or that it should be accompanied or followed by some relative act which
                        rendered it something more than a mere interchange of consent. Under the
                        jurisprudence of the XII. Tables the formalities required to elevate an
                        agreement to the rank of contract and make it civilly obligatory sometimes
                        combined ceremonial act and words of style, sometimes did not go beyond
                        words of style, but in all cases took place before witnesses. <hi

                        a dowry with his daughter whom he was giving in marriage, and txjd/mozrittw,
                        the guarantee of a surety for the due fulfilment of the undertaking either
                        of a party to a contract or a party to a litigation (some think only the
                        latter), probably required nothing more than words of style before persons
                        who could if necessary bear witness to them; whereas an engagement incident
                        to a mancipation, or an undertaking to repay borrowed money, required in
                        addition a ceremony with the copper and the scales. This undertaking to
                        repay arose from the contract of <hi rend="italic">nexum,</hi> which was, it
                        is thought, older than the Tables; both it and the verbal contract by <hi

                        <hi rend="italic"/> The tumults and seditions so frequent in Rome during the
                        first two centuries of the Republic are as frequently attributed by ancient
                        writers to the abuses of the law of debt as to any other cause, social or
                        political. The circumstances of the poorer plebeians were such as to make it
                        almost impossible to avoid borrowing. Their scanty means were dependent on
                        the regular cultivation of their little acres, and on each operation of the
                        agricultural year being performed in proper rotation and at the proper
                        season. But this was every now and again interfered with by wars which
                        detained them from home at seed-time or harvest, practically rendering their
                        farms unproductive, and leaving them and their families in straits for the
                        commonest necessaries of life.</p>
                   <p>The practice of lending <hi rend="italic">per libram</hi> was doubtless of
                        great antiquity—indeed, the intervention of the scales was a necessity when
                        money or what passed for it had to be weighed instead of counted; and not
                        improbably old custom conceded to a lender who had thus made an advance in
                        the presence of witnesses some very summary and stringent remedy against a
                        borrower who failed in repayment. How, after the Servian reforms, it was
                        subjected to much the same formalities as were required for mancipation has
                        been shown already. With the introduction of a coinage the transaction,
                        instead of being <hi rend="italic">per libram</hi> simply, became one <hi
                            rend="italic">per aes et libram}</hi> the scales were touched with a
                        single piece, representing the money which had already been or was about to
                        be paid, a formula recited whereby the obligation of repayment was imposed
                        on the borrower, and an appeal made to the witnesses for their testimony.
                        Unfortunately this formula is nowhere preserved. Huschke assuming that the
                        lender was the only speaker, formulates it thus— <hi rend="sup">u</hi> quod
                        ego tibi mille libras hoc aere aeneaque libra nexas dedi, eas tu mihi post
                        annum jure nexi dare damnas esto ”— <hi rend="sup">a</hi> whereas with this
                        coin and these copper scales I have given thee a thousand <hi rend="italic"
                            >asses,</hi> be thou therefore bound <hi rend="italic">jure nexi</hi> to
                        repay them to me a year hence.” The phrase <hi rend="italic">damnas
                            esto,</hi> like the rest of the formula, is unsupported by any
                        conclusive authority;</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0546" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0587.jp2"/>
                   <p>but, as it is in harmony with the formula which is given by Gaius for
                        dissolving an obligation of this kind, and with that most frequently
                        employed in the Republic for imposing by a public act liability to pay a
                        fixed and definite sum, it may not be wide of the mark.</p>
                   <p>What was the effect of this procedure? The question is one not easily
                        answered. Brinz expressed the opinion that the creditor was entitled in
                        virtue of the <hi rend="italic">nexum</hi> to take his debtor into custody
                        at any time when he considered such a course necessary for his own
                        protection, even before the conventional term of repayment— that the debtor
                        was in bonds, virtually a pledge, from the very first, and the tightness or
                        looseness of them a matter in the discretion of his creditor. <note
                            anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="84"> Brinz, in
                            Griinhut’s <hi rend="italic">Zeitschr.</hi> i. 22. He likens the
                            position of the <hi rend="italic">nexus</hi> to that of a thing—land,
                            say—mortgaged to a creditor in security of a claim. Such security the
                            Roman jurists constantly speak of as <hi rend="italic">res
                                oblígala,</hi> and sometimes as <hi rend="italic">res nexa.</hi> As
                            Brinz observes, the thing was <hi rend="italic">oblígala</hi> from the
                            first, and continued so as long as the debt it secured was unpaid, even
                            though the creditor found it unnecessary to reduce it into possession or
                            interfere with it in any way. </note> Voigt holds that the <hi
                            rend="italic">nexum</hi> did not give the creditor any peculiar hold
                        over his debtor, and that on the latter’s failure to repay an ordinary
                        action was necessary, to be followed by the usual proceedings in execution
                        if judgment was in favour of the former. These views may be said to be the
                        two extremes; and between them lie a.good many others, more or less
                        divergent. The difficulty of arriving at a conclusion is caused to some
                        extent by the ambiguity of the words <hi rend="italic">nexus</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">nexum.</hi> The transaction itself was called <hi
                            rend="italic">nexum</hi> and occasionally also <hi rend="italic"
                            >nexus-,</hi> the money advanced was <hi rend="italic">nexum aes</hi>
                        (hence <hi rend="italic">next, i.e. aeris, datio}*,</hi> the bond was <hi
                            rend="italic">nexus</hi> (of the fourth declension); and the debtor on
                        whom the bond was laid was also <hi rend="italic">nexus</hi> (of the
                        second). All this is simple enough. But we find the same word <hi
                            rend="italic">nexus</hi> employed by the historians as almost synonymous
                        with <hi rend="italic">vinctus—</hi> to denote the condition of a debtor put
                        in fetters by his creditor. That might be the condition either of a nexal
                        borrower or of an ordinary judgment-debtor. The former in such a case. was
                        doubly <hi rend="italic">nexus-,</hi> he was at once in the bonds of legal
                        obligation and in those of physical constraint. In many passages in which
                        Livy and others speak of the <hi rend="italic">nexi</hi> it is extremely
                        difficult, sometimes impossible, to be sure in which sense they use the
                        word. It is therefore not surprising that there should be considerable
                        diversity of opinion on the subject. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                   <p>Since Huschke, the great majority of writers—Voigt <note anchored="true"
                            place="bottom" type="authorial" n="86"> He holds that the obligation
                            created <hi rend="italic">nexo</hi> did not impose any immediate
                            liability on the borrower which the lender could enforce without
                            judicial intervention, but that the latter required to proceed against

                            the necessity of further proceedings after the nexal contract, and
                            rejects the notion of non-judicial <hi rend="italic">manus

                                nuncupatae</hi> as nonexistent. Cf. Mitteis, <hi rend="italic">Rom.
                                Privatrecht</hi> (1908), pp. 137 seq. According to Lenel, <hi
                                rend="italic">Z. d. Sar. Stift.</hi> 84 seq., there never existed
                            any nexal contract of loan, and the whole doctrine on the subject has
                            therefore no solid foundation. </note> Lend and Mitteis are
                        distinguished exceptions—concur in opinion that the nexal contract entitled
                        the creditor, after expiry of thirty days from the conventional date of
                        repayment of the loan, to proceed against his debtor by wiawwj <hi
                            rend="italic">injectio</hi> without any antecedent action or judgment,
                        and failing settlement to detain him, and put him to servile labour, and
                        subject him to servile treatment, until the loan was repaid. The parallel of
                        such a course is to be met with amongst many ancient nations—Jews, Greeks,
                        Scandinavians, Germans, &amp;c. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                                <hi rend="italic">Zeitschr.</hi> i. 25. The Greek phrase was <hi
                                rend="italic">M a&amp;nart bavdfrw.</hi> There is a curious style in
                            Marculfus <hi rend="italic">(Form.</hi> ii. 27), in which a borrower
                            engages that, until he shall have repaid his loan, his creditor shall
                            have right to his services so many days a week, and shall have power to
                            inflict corporal punishment if there be dilatoriness in rendering them.
                        </note> And it was not altogether unreasonable. If a borrower had already
                        exhausted all available means of raising money, had sold or mortgaged
                        everything he possessed of any value, what other course was open to him in
                        his necessity except to impledge himself? That the creditor should have been
                        entitled to realize the right he had thus acquired without the judgment on
                        it of a court of law is equally intelligible. It was just a case of
                        regulated self-help. The nexal contract was a public act, carried out in the
                        presence of the five citizen witnesses and <hi rend="italic">libripens,</hi>
                        who were witnesses alike of the acknowledgment of indebtedness and of the
                        tacit engagement of the debtor. The only valid objection apparently that
                        could be stated against the creditor’s apprehension of his debtor in
                        execution was that the indebtedness no longer existed—that the loan had been
                        repaid. But a nexal debt</p>
                   <p>could be legally discharged only by <hi rend="italic">nexi liberatio,</hi>
                        which also was a solemn procedure <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram</hi>
                        in the presence of five citizen witnesses. What need for a judicial inquiry
                        in the presence of facts so notorious? A creditor would rarely be daring
                        enough to proceed to <hi rend="italic">manus injectio</hi> if his loan had
                        been repaid; if he did, the testimony of the witnesses to the discharge
                        would at once procure <hi rend="sup">:</hi> the release of his alleged
                        debtor. It was probably to give opportunity for such proof, if there was
                        room for it, that the XI1. Tables required that a creditor who had
                        apprehended a nexal debtor should bring him into court before carrying him
                        off into detention.</p>
                   <p>Whether there was room for a <hi rend="italic">vindex</hi> and for a
                        magisterial addiction of the debtor after sixty days, with power to kill or
                        sell into slavery after addiction, are disputed questions, but there seems
                        no good reason for distinguishing a nexal from a <hi rend="italic"
                            >judicatus</hi> debtor in these respects. Untenable is the notion at any
                        rate that the <hi rend="italic">nexus</hi> by the mere contract was placed
                            <hi rend="italic">in loco servi,</hi> or that by arrest he was in a
                        worse position than one condemned for a judgment debt, of whom Quintilian
                        states distinctly that he still retained his position in the census and in
                        his tribe. Many a time when the exigencies of the state required it, were
                        the <hi rend="italic">nexi</hi> temporarily released in order to obey a call
                        to arms—to fulfil the duty incumbent on them as citizens. The nexal debtor’s
                        position after arrest in regard to his family rights is obscure. If
                        originally they shared his nexal condition, this did not long continue to be
                        the law. If he was a house-father he seemingly still retained his <hi
                            rend="italic">manus</hi> over his wife and <hi rend="italic"
                            >potestas</hi> over his children. Their earnings legally belonged to
                        him, and did not fall to his creditor. It was the body of his debtor that
                        the creditor was entitled to, and too often he wreaked his vengeance on it
                        by way of punishment; there was as yet no machinery for attaching the
                        debtor’s goods in substantial reparation for the loss caused by his breach
                        of contract.</p>
                   <p>The abuses to which this system of personal execution gave rise were great.
                        Livy tells us that in the year 428 u.c. (326 B.c.) a more than ordinarily
                        flagrant outrage committed by a creditor upon one of his young <hi
                            rend="italic">nexi,</hi> who had given himself up as responsible for a
                        loan contracted by his deceased father, roused the populace to such a pitch
                        of indignation as to necessitate instant remedial legislation. The result
                        was the Poetilian law <hi rend="italic">(Lex Poetilia Papiria).</hi> So far
                        as can be gathered from the meagre accounts of it we possess, it contained
                        at least these three provisions—(1) that fetters and neck, arm or foot
                        blocks should in future be applied only to persons undergoing imprisonment
                        for crime or delict; (2) that no one should ever again be the <hi
                            rend="italic">nexus</hi> of his creditor in respect of borrowed money;
                        and (3) that all existing <hi rend="italic">nexi</hi> should be released.
                        The first was intended to prevent unnecessary restraint upon
                        judgment-debtors formally given over to their enditors. The second did not
                        necessarily abolish the contract of Ioan <hi rend="italic">per aes et
                            libram,</hi> but only what had hitherto been an <hi rend="italic">ipso
                            jure</hi> consequence of it—the creditor’s right to incarcerate his
                        debtor without either the judgment of a court or the warrant of a
                        magistrate. For the future, execution was to be done against a borrower only
                        as a judgment-debtor formally made over to his creditor by magisterial
                        decree, and under the restrictions and limitations imposed by the Poetilian
                        law itself. This very soon led to the disuse of nexal obligation; once it
                        was deprived of its distinctive processual advantages it rapidly gave place
                        to the simpler engagement by stipulation usually enforceable <hi
                            rend="italic">per condictionem.</hi> As for the release of the then
                        existing <hi rend="italic">nexi,</hi> Cicero, Livy and Dionysius say nothing
                        of any condition annexed to the boon the statute conferred upon them; but
                        Varro limits it to those <hi rend="italic">qui bonam copiam jurarunt</hi>
                        —those apparently who were able to declare on oath that they had done their
                        best.and could do no more to meet their creditors’ claims. <note

                        limitation can hardly be called unreasonable, even were we to assume—as
                        probably we ought to do—that the release spoken of was only from the bonds
                        of physical restraint, not from those of legal obligation.</p>

                        followed by more far-reaching consequences than the introduction of the
                        stipulation. It exercised an enormous influence on the law of contract; for
                        by means of it there was created a unilateral obligation that in time became
                        adaptable to almost every conceivable undertaking by one man in favour of
                        another. By the use of certain words of style in the form of question and
                        answer any lawful agreement could thereby be made not only</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0547" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0588.jp2"/>
                   <p>morally but legally binding, so that much which previously had no other
                        guarantee than a man’s sense of honour now passed directly under the
                        protection of the tribunals. Stipulations became the complement of
                        engagements which without them rested simply on good faith, as when a vendor
                        gave his stipu-latory promise to his vendee to guarantee peaceable
                        possession of the thing sold or its freedom from faults, and the vendee in
                        turn gave his promise for payment of the price. The question and answer in
                        the form prescribed by law made the engagement fast and sure. Hence the
                        generic name of the contract; for Paul’s derivation of it from <hi
                            rend="italic">stipuhtm,</hi> “ firm ” (which itself comes from <hi
                            rend="italic">stipes,</hi> a staff), is to be preferred to that of Varro
                        and Festus from <hi rend="italic">slips</hi> (money), or to a later and
                        rather fanciful one from <hi rend="italic">stipula</hi> (a straw). It was
                        round the stipulation that the jurists grouped most of their disquisitions
                        upon the general doctrines of the law of contract—capacity of parties,
                        requisites of consent, consequences of fraud, error and intimidation,
                        effects of conditions and specifications of time, and so forth. It may well
                        be said, therefore, that its introduction marked an epoch in the history of
                        the law.</p>
                   <p>There is, however, no certainty either as to. the time or as to the manner
                        of its introduction. So far as appears, it was unknown at the time of the
                        compilation of the XII. Tables, at least in-private life; one of the first
                        unmistakable allusions to it is in the Aquilian.law of about 287 B.c. The
                        mention of it in that enactment, however, is with regard to a phase of it
                        which cannot have been reached for many years after it had come into use;
                        and the probability is that it originated before the middle of the 5th
                        century of the city, its first statutory recognition being in the Silian law
                        introducing the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per condictionem (infra,</hi>
                        p. 550). In its earliest days it bore tne name not <hi rend="italic">of*
                            stipulatio</hi> but of <hi rend="italic">sponsio,</hi> for the reason
                        that the interrogatory of the party becoming creditor was invariably
                        formulated with the word <hi rend="italic">spondes</hi> —e.g. <hi
                            rend="italic">centum dare spondes?—</hi> while the answer was simply <hi
                            rend="italic">spondeo.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>There has been much speculation as to the origin of the contract. Modern
                        criticism has three theories: (1) that it was the verbal remnant of the <hi
                            rend="italic">nexum,</hi> after the business with the copper and the
                        scales had gone into disuse; (2) that it was evolved out of the oath ( <hi
                            rend="italic">jusjurandum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">sponsio</hi> at the
                        great altar of Hercules and the appeal to Fides ( <hi rend="italic"
                            >supra,</hi> p. 534); (3) that it was imported from Latium, which it had
                        reached from some of the Greek settlements farther south. The last view is
                        the most probable, though there is much to be said also in favour of the
                        second theory. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="90">

                        practice passed into Sicily and Lower Italy, but that gradually the libation
                        and other religious features were dropped, although the word <hi

                        that bound parties just as if the old ritual had been observed, and that it
                        travelled northward into Latium and thence to Rome under the name of <hi

                        conclusion of contracts. The meaning of <hi rend="italic">spondes</hi> as a
                        question by a creditor to his debtor (although latterly, we may well
                        believe, unknown to them) thus came to be: “ Do you engage as solemnly as if
                        the old ceremonial were gone through between us?” . There are many examples
                        of such simplification of terms, none more familiar than when a man says,
                            <hi rend="sup">h</hi> I give you my oath upon it,” without either
                        himself or the individual addressed thinking it</p>
                   <p>necessary that the form should;be gone through.</p>
                   <p>It is not a little remarkable that the use of the words <hi rend="italic"
                            >spondes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">spondeo</hi> in contracting were,
                        down at least to the time of Gaius, confined in Rome to Roman citizens. The
                            <hi rend="italic">nature sponsio</hi> as a form of contract was
                        essentially <hi rend="italic">juris civilis.</hi> So at first were the later
                        and less solemn forms of stipulation— <hi rend="italic">promittisne?
                            promitto, jideipromitlisne? fidei-promitto.</hi> Gaius speaks of these
                        latter, along with such simple forms as <hi rend="italic">dabisne? dabo
                            faciesne? faciam,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">juris gentium, i.e.</hi>
                        binding even between Romans and peregrins. Such they became eventually, but
                        peregrins probably could not make use of the stipulation until a good while
                        after the <hi rend="italic">lex Silia.</hi> Yet although <hi rend="italic"
                            >juris civilis,</hi> both the <hi rend="italic">sponsio</hi> and the
                        later forms were</p>
                   <p>from the first free from many of the impediments of the earlier <hi
                            rend="italic">actus legitimi.</hi> No witnesses were required to assist
                        at them; and they were always susceptible of qualification by conditions and
                        terms. It was long, however, before parties had much latitude in their
                        choice of language; <hi rend="italic">spondeo</hi> was so peculiarly solemn
                        that no equivalent could be admitted; and even the later styles may be said
                        to have remained stereotyped until well on in the Empire. And it was the use
                        of the words of style that made the contract. It was formal, not material;
                        that is to say, action lay upon the promise the words embodied, apart from
                        any consideration whether or not value had been given for it. In time this
                        serious disadvantage was abated by praetorian exceptions and otherwise, as
                        will be noted below. Originally the stipulation was employed only in regard
                        to engagements whose terms were in every respect definite and certain, and
                        was enforced by the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per condictionem,</hi> or
                        sometimes possibly by <hi rend="italic">actio Sacramento in personam.</hi>
                        But in time it came to be employed in engagements that were from the first
                        indefinite. This seems to have been due to the intervention of the praetors,
                        and to have received special impetus after,the system of the <hi
                            rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> had begun to give place to that <hi
                            rend="italic">per formulas.</hi> The remedy in such a case was not
                        spoken of as a <hi rend="italic">condiction</hi> but as an <hi rend="italic"

                        procedure was called which prevailed in Rome down to the substitution of
                        that <hi rend="italic">per formulas</hi> by the Aebutian and Julian laws—the
                        first either in the 6th or early in the 7th century of the city, and the
                        second in the age of Augustus. He tells us that as <hi rend="italic">genera
                            agendi</hi> or generic forms of process they were five in number, each
                        taking its name from its characteristic feature, viz. (1) <hi rend="italic"
                            >Sacramento,</hi> (2) <hi rend="italic">per judicis postulationem,</hi>
                        (3) <hi rend="italic">per condictionem,</hi> (4) <hi rend="italic">per manus
                            injectionem,</hi> and (s) <hi rend="italic">per pignoris capionem.</hi>
                        The third was unknown in the decemviral period, and was introduced by the
                        Silian law formerly mentioned. The other four were all more or less
                        regulated by the XII. Tables, but must in some form have been anterior to
                        them. It is utterly impossible, however, to say of any one of them, apart
                        from the <hi rend="italic">condictes,</hi> at what time it was introduced,
                        or what was the statute <hi rend="italic">(lex)</hi> by which it was
                        sanctioned; it may well be that they were not of statutory introduction at
                        all, but were called <hi rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> simply because
                        recognized and indirectly confirmed by the Tables. In character and purpose
                        each of the five had its peculiarities. The first three were directly
                        employed for determining a question of right or liability, which, if
                        persistently disputed, inevitably resulted in a judicial inquiry. The fourth
                        and fifth might possibly result in judicial intervention; but primarily they
                        were proceedings in execution, in which the party moving in them worked out
                        his own remedy. As regards their comparative antiquity, there is much to be
                        said for the opinion of Jhering and Bekker that <hi rend="italic">manus
                            injectio,</hi> as essentially nothing more than regulated self-help,
                        must have been the earliest of the five, and that the <hi rend="italic"
                            >legis actio Sacramento</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">judicis
                            postulatio</hi> must have been introduced in aid of it, and to prevent
                        too hasty resort to it where there was room for doubt upon questions either
                        of fact or law.</p>

                   <p>In the three judicial <hi rend="italic">legis aciiones</hi> the first step
                        was the <hi rend="italic">in jus vocatio</hi> or procedure for bringing the
                        respondent into court, minutely regulated by the provisions of the first of
                        the XII. Tables. This was not done by any officers of the law; there was no
                        writ of summons of any sort; the party moving in the contemplated litigation
                        had himself to do what was needed. If the defendant did not appear, there
                        could be no decree by default. Once before the magistrate (consul or
                        praetor), the plaintiff stated his contention. If admitted or not disputed
                        by the defendant, the magistrate at once pronounced his decree, leaving the
                        plaintiff to work out his remedy as the law prescribed. But, if the case
                        presented was met either with a denial or counterclaim, the magistrate
                        remitted it. for trial either to a collegiate tribunal or to one or more
                        private citizens as judges or arbiters. The act of remit was technically <hi
                            rend="italic">litis contestatio</hi> or <hi rend="italic">ordinatio
                            judicii,</hi> the first so named because originally the parties called
                        upon those present to be witnesses to the issue that was being sent for
                        trial. This was the ordinary practice under both the system of the <hi
                            rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> and that of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >formulae,</hi> and continued to exist until the time of Diocletian. In
                        the first stage the proceedings were said to be <hi rend="italic">in
                            jure,</hi> and the duties of the magistrate in reference to them were
                        part of his <hi rend="italic">jurisdiction</hi> in the second they were said
                        to be <hi rend="italic">in judicio,</hi> those presiding in it being styled
                            <hi rend="italic">judices.</hi> All that the judge or judges had to do
                        was.to pass judgment on the question remitted to them. They were “
                        right-declarers ” only, not “ right-enforcers.” If their judgment was for
                        the. plaintiff, and he failed to obtain an amicable settlement, he had
                        himself to make it operative by subsequent proceedings by <hi rend="italic"
                            >manus injectio,</hi> and that under the eye of the magistrate, not of
                        the judge.</p>
                   <p>From an enumeration in Cicero of a variety of causes proper to the
                        centumviral court the conclusion seems warranted that it was its peculiar
                        province to decide questions of quiritary right in the strictest acceptation
                        of the word. They were all apparently in his time real actions
                        (viWiia/wnij)—claims of property in land or of servitudes over it, of right
                        as heir under a testament or in opposition to it, of rights of tutory and
                        succession <hi rend="italic">ab intestato</hi> as agnate or gentile, and so
                        forth. It was a numerous.court of Quirites, determining by its vote the
                        question of quiritary right submitted to it. Many such questions in course
                        of time, and possibly at first of express consent of parties, came to
                        be.referred to a single judge;.but some, and notably claims of inheritance
                        under or in opposition to a testament, were still frequently remitted to the
                        centumviral court even in the classical period. Personal actions, however,
                        do not appear ever to have fallen within its cognizance: they were usually
                        sent to a. single judge—a private citizen—selected by the parties, but
                        appointed by the magistrate, and to whom the latter administered an oath of
                        office. But, in a few cases in which an action involved not so much a
                        disputed question of right as the exercise of skill and discretion in
                        determining the nature and extent of a right that in the abstract was not
                        denied, the remit was to a plurality of private judges or arbiters, usually
                        three.</p>

                            >legis actio,</hi> as described by Gaius, was that the parties, after a
                        somewhat dramatic performance before the magistrate, each challenged the
                        other to stake a certain sum, the amount of which was fixed by the Tables,
                        and which was to abide the issue of the inquiry by the court or judge to
                        whom the cause was eventually remitted. This stake Gaius refers to
                        indifferently as <hi rend="italic">sacramentum, summa sacramenti,</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">poena sacramenti.</hi> The formal question the court
                        had to determine was—whose stake had been justified, whose not <hi
                            rend="italic">(cujus sacramentum justum, cujus injustum);</hi> the first
                        was returned to the staker, the second forfeited originally to sacred and
                        afterwards to public uses. But the decision on this formal question
                        necessarily involved a judgment on the matter actually in dispute, and, if
                        it was for the plaintiff, entitled him, failing an amicable arrangement, to
                        take ulterior steps for making it effectual. The procedure was still
                        employed in the</p>
                   <p>time of Gaius in the few cases that continued to be referred to the
                        centumviral cou|;t, but otherwise it had been long in disuse.</p>
                   <p>Gaius explains that it was resorted to both in real and personal actions.
                        Unfortunately the MS. of his Institutes is defective in the passage in which
                        he described its application to the latter. We possess the greater part of
                        his account of the <hi rend="italic">actio in rem</hi> as employed to raise
                        and determine a question of ownership; but his illustration is of
                        vindication of a slave, and not so interesting or instructive as the
                        proceedings for vindication of land. These, however, can be reconstructed
                        with tolerable certainty with the aid derived from other sources, especially
                        from Cicero, Varro and Gellius.</p>
                   <p>The parties appeared before the magistrate, each carrying a rod <hi
                            rend="italic">(festuca)</hi> representing his spear <hi rend="italic"
                            >(quir</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hasta),</hi> the symbol, as Gaius says,
                        of quiritarian ownership. The first word was spoken by the raiser of the
                        action, and addressed to his opponent: “ I say that the land in question
                        [describing it sufficiently for identification] is mine in quiritary right
                            <hi rend="italic">(meum esse ex jure quiritium)</hi> ; wherefore I
                        require you to go there and join issue with me in presence of the magistrate
                            <hi rend="italic">(in jure manum conserere).”</hi> Thereupon, according
                        to the earliest practice, the magistrate and the parties, accompanied by
                        their friends and backers, proceeded to the ground for the purpose: the
                        court was transferred from the forum to the land itself. As distances
                        increased, however, and.the engagements of the consuls multiplied, this
                        became inconvenient. Instead of it, the parties went to the spot without the
                        magistrate, but on his command, and there joined issue in the presence of
                        their seconds, who had been ordered to accompany them, and who probably made
                        a report of the due observance of formalities on their return. Still later
                        the procedure was further simplified by having a turf or sod brought from
                        the place beforehand, and deposited a few yards from the magistrate’s chair;
                        and, when he ordered the parries to go to the ground and join issue, they
                        merely brought foiward the turf anti set it before him, and proceeded to
                        make their formal vindications upon it, as representing the whole land in
                        dispute..</p>
                   <p>The ritual was as follows: The raiser of the action, addressing his
                        adversary, again confirmed his ownership, but this time with the significant
                        addition: “As I have asserted my right by word of mouth, look you, so do I
                        now with <hi rend="italic">my vindicta ”</hi> and therewith he touched the
                        turf with his rod, which was called <hi rend="italic">vindicta</hi> when
                        employed for this purpose. The magistrate then asked the other party whether
                        he meant to counter-vindicate. If he replied in the negative or made no
                        response, there was instant decree <hi rend="italic">(addictio)</hi> in
                        favour of the first party, and the proceedings were at an end. If, however,
                        he counter-vindicated, it was by repeating the same words and going through
                        the same form as his adversary: “ I say that the land is mine in quiritary
                        right, and I too lay my <hi rend="italic">vindicta.</hi> upon it.” The
                        verbal and symbolical vindication and counter-vindication completed what was
                        technically the <hi rend="italic">manus consertio.</hi> The parties were now
                        in this position: each had asserted, his ownership, and had figuratively had
                        recourse to arms in maintenance of his contention. But the matter was to be
                        settled judicially, so the magistrate once more intervened and ordered both
                        to withdraw from the land. The dialogue was then resumed, the vindicant
                        demanding to know from his opponent upon what, pretence <hi rend="italic"
                            >(causa)</hi> he had counter-vindicated. In the illustration in Gaius he
                        avoided the question and pleaded the general issue:I have done as is my
                        right in laying my <hi rend="italic">vindicta</hi> on the land.” But there
                        can be little doubt that in certain circumstances the counter-vindicant
                        would deem it expedient to disclose his title. This was very necessary where
                        he attributed his right to a conveyance upon which two years’ possession had
                        not yet followed; in such a case he had to name his author <hi rend="italic"
                            >(auctorem laudare)</hi> if he desired to preserve recourse against the
                        latter on the warranty implied in the mancipation. That probably entailed a
                        suspension of the proceedings to allow of the author’s citation for his
                        interest; and on their resumption, if he appeared and admitted his <hi
                            rend="italic">auctoritas,</hi> he was formally made a party to the
                        action.</p>
                   <p>The proceedings had now reached the stage at which the sacrament came into
                        play. The first challenge came from the vindicant, —“ Since you have
                        vindicated unrightfully, 1 challenge you with a sacrament of 500 <hi
                            rend="italic">asses}'</hi> to which the counter-vindicant responded, —“
                        And I you.” This was technically the <hi rend="italic">Sacramento
                            provocatio.</hi> The magistrate thereupon remitted. the matter for trial
                        to the centumviral court, or to a single judge, having declared what exactly
                        was the question put in issue which the court or judge wafe to decide. Tjie
                        parties then called upon the bystanders to be witnesses of the magistrate’s
                        remit, this appeal to witnesses being, as is. generally held, the <hi

                        procedure, the magistrate required sureties from the parties for the
                        eventual payment by him who was unsuccessful of the sacrament he had offered

                   <p>stake, and which became a forfeit to the exchequer. (The original practice
                        probably was for the stake to be deposited by both parties in the hands of
                        the pontiffs before they were heard by the judge or judges; after judgment
                        that of the gainer was restored to him, while that of the loser was retained
                        for religious uses.) The magistrate also made arrangements for the interim
                        possession of the land by one or other of the litigants (but preferably, it
                        is thought, by the possessor), taking security from him that, if he was
                        eventually unsuccessful, it should be returned to his opponent, along with
                        all the fruits and profits drawn in the interval. At the trial, as both
                        parties were vindicants, there must have been a certain burden of proof upon
                        both sides. The vindicant, one may believe, must have been required to
                        establish in the first instance that the thing he claimed had at some time
                        been his; and then, but probably not till then, the counter-vindicant would
                        have to prove a later title in his person sufficient to exclude that of his
                        opponent. The judgment, as already observed, necessarily involved a finding
                        on the main question; but in form it was a declaration as to the sacrament:
                        that. of the party who prevailed .was declared to be just, and that of his
                        unsuccessful opponent unjust.</p>
                   <p>Looking at this ritual as a whole, the conviction is irresistible that it
                        could not have been so devised by one brain. It reveals and combines three
                        distinct stages in the history’ of procedure— appeal to arms and self-help,
                        appeal to the gods and the spiritual power, appeal to the civil magistrate
                        and nis judicial office. As Gellius says, the real and substantial fight for
                        might, that in olden days had been maintained at the point of the spear, had
                        given place to a civil and festucarian combat in which words were the
                        weapons, and which was to be settled by the interposition of .the praetor.
                        But this does not explain the <hi rend="italic">sacramentum.</hi> Various
                        theories have been proposed to account for it. According to Gaius, it was
                        nothing more than the sum of money staked by each of the parties, uhieh was
                        forfeited originally to sacred and afterwards to public uses by him who was
                        unsuccessful, as a penalty for his rashly running into litigation; and
                        substantially the same explanation is given by Festus in one of his
                        definitions of the word. But this is far from satisfactory, for it involves
                        the apparent absurdity of declaring that a penalty imposed by law could be
                        just in the case of the party who was in the right, and unjust in the case
                        of him who was in the wrong. There is another definition in Festus— “ a
                        thing is said to be done <hi rend="italic">Sacramento</hi> when the sanction
                        of an oath is interposed ”—that lends support to the opinion that there was
                        a time when parties to a question of right were required to take an oath to
                        the verity of their respective assertions; that they were also required
                        concurrently to deposit five bullocks or five sheep, according to the nature
                        or value of the thing in dispute, to abide the issue of the inquiry; <note
                            anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="95"> It was the <hi
                                rend="italic">Lex Aternia Tarpeia</hi> of the year 454 B.c. that
                            commuted the five bullocks and five sheep into 500 and 50 lb of copper
                            respectively (Cie. <hi rend="italic">De Rep.</hi> ii. 35, § 60, where
                            the words usually printed “ de multae sacramento ” should read “ dc

                            interesting to note that, by the customs of the modern Ossetians, ten
                            sheep are also held to be equivalent to one ox. See Kovalewsky, <hi

                        question for determination was whose oath was just and whose unjust; and
                        that he who was found to have sworn unjustly forfeited his cattle or sheep

                        deity—while the other party reclaimed his from the repository in which they

                            both banks of the. river by bridges bearing no particular names, he
                            suggested that the island may have been the place to which disputants
                            resorted to make their <hi rend="italic">sacramenta,</hi> and that the
                            cattle, sheep or money were deposited in a place for the purpose before
                            the bridge was crossed. Much the same explanation was offered by Huschkc
                            two years later in his book <hi rend="italic">Das alte römische
                                Jahr</hi> (Breslau, 1869), p. 360, apparently without being aware ,
                            of Danz’s speculation. He adds, on the authority of the Iguvine Tables,
                            that, while bullocks were offered to Jupiter, only sheep were offered to
                            Dius Fidius. The island, he thinks, must have been selected as neutral
                            ground to which all parties might have access, and which obviated
                            intrusion into </note> It was made an opportunity doubtless by the

                   <p>The writers who adopt this view are far from being unanimous as to details.
                        But there seems to be enough to render it more than probable that, at an
                        intermediate stage between the <hi rend="italic">vera solida vis</hi> of
                        ancient, times and the <hi rend="italic">vis civilis et festucaría</hi>
                        which Gellius and Gaius depict, there was a procedure by appeal to the gods
                        through means of oaths of verity sworn by the parties, in the manner and
                        with the consequences that have been indicated. That in time it should have
                        dropped out of the ritual is quite in the order of things. Its tendency was
                        to become a mere form, imposing no real restraint on reckless litigation.
                        The restraint was rather in the dread of forfeiture of the sacramental
                        cattle, sheep or money that would follow a verdict that an oath had been
                        unjust. And it must have been felt besides that it was unfair to brand a man
                        as a false-swearer, needing to expiate his offence by an offering to the
                        godr, whose oath had been perfectly honest. That he should suffer a
                        penalty.for his imprudence in not having taken more care to ascertain his
                        position, and for thus causing needless annoyance to others, was reasonable,
                        but did not justify his being dealt with as one who had knowingly outraged
                        the deity to whom he had appealed. So the oath—the original <hi
                            rend="italic">sacramentum—</hi> disappeared, the name passing by a
                        natural enough process to the money which had been wont to be deposited
                        before the oath was sworn, but which now ceased to be an offering in
                        expiation by a false-swearer, and became a mere penalty (forfeited to the
                        state) of rash litigation <hi rend="italic">(poena temer</hi> e <hi
                            rend="italic">litizantis).</hi> So when <hi rend="italic">praedes</hi>
                        later took the place of actual deposits, they became bound as state debtors
                        for the <hi rend="italic">sacramentum.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>It may well be assumed that in most cases the finding of the court as to the
                        justness or unjustness of the respective sacraments of the</p>
                   <p>Íjarties was the end of the case—that it was at once accepted and oyally
                        given effect to.. If in favour of the party to whom interim possession had
                        been given by the magistrate there could be no difficulty; he retained.the
                        object in dispute with the fruits and profits he had drawn in the interval
                        between <hi rend="italic">litis contestatio</hi> and judgment. If, however,
                        the finding was for the other party, and amicable arrangement was not come
                        to, it is not clear what*course was followed. Gaius says that in awarding
                        interim possession <hi rend="italic">(vindicias dicere)</hi> the praetor
                        required the grantee to give security by sureties <hi rend="italic"
                            >(praedes) to</hi> his adversary for restitution to the latter in the
                        event of his success; while Festus preserves a law of the XII. Tables which,
                        according to Mommsen’s rendering, declared that, when it turned out that
                        interim possession had been awarded to the wrong party, it was to be in such
                        party’s power to demand the appointment of three arbiters who should
                        ascertain the value of the object of vindication and its fruits, and assess
                        the damages due for non-restitution at double the amount. This provision
                        seems to have been intended to afford the wrongful interim possessor, who
                        was not in a position to make specific restitution to his successful
                        opponent, a means of avoiding the apprehension and imprisonment which were
                        the statutory consequences of failure to implement a judgment. It is
                        probable that in time this duplicated money payment came to be regarded as
                        the satisfaction to which the successful party in a vindication was entitled
                        in every case in which, no matter for what reason,, he was unable to obtain
                        the thing itself and its fruits.from their interim possessor; that
                        consequently an <hi rend="italic">arbitrium lili aestimandae,</hi> or
                        reference to arbiters to assess their value, resulted in every such case;
                        and that it was to assure its payment that the praetor required the party to
                        whom the interim possession was.awarded to give to. his opponent the
                        sureties <hi rend="italic">(praedes litis et vindiciarum)</hi> to whom Gaius
                        alludes. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="97">
                            Another theory is that, while the interim possessor could not be
                            proceeded against, the <hi rend="italic">praedes,</hi> who were really
                            bound in his place and not merely as accessories, were directly subject

                   <p>This procedure in the sacramental action for vindication of land was
                        applicable to every kind of <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> which a man could
                        claim to have over persons or things, though necessarily with variations
                        more or less important in the ritual. But the sacramental action was also
                        quite common for claims <hi rend="italic">in personam.</hi> As regards
                        personal actions, the ordinarily received opinion, which rests, however, on
                        slender foundations, is that from the first the parties met on equal terms;
                        that, if it was a case of money debt, the creditor commenced the proceedings
                        with the averment that the defendant owed him the sum in question,—“ I. say
                        that you ought to pay me <hi rend="italic">(dare oportere)</hi> iooo <hi
                            rend="italic">asses</hi> that this was met with a denial; and that a
                        sacramental challenge followed on either, side. All are agreed that the
                        remit was to a single <hi rend="italic">judex</hi> after an interval of
                        thirty days from the proceedings <hi rend="italic">in jure*</hi> that where
                        the claim was. for a definite sum the plaintiff had to establish his case.to
                        the letter; and that his sacrament was necessarily declared unjust if he
                        failed to prove his claim by a single penny. But there is considerable
                        diversity of opinion as to whether by this form of process a claim of
                        uncertain amount</p>
                   <p>the temples of the two gods on the Capitol and Quirinal respectively. And it
                        is to its use as the scene of the sacramental procedure that he attributes
                        its name of “ holy island,” rather than.to the fact of its having been the
                        seat of the temple of Aesculapius. Huschke recurs to and enforces this view
                        in his <hi rend="italic">Multa und Sacramentum</hi> (1874), p. 410, where he
                        docs refer to Danz’s paper.</p>

                   <p>could be insisted on—as, for example, for damages for breach of a warranty

                        given, and has it failed?—the sum due in respect of the breach being left to

                        case might be) in all probability was part of the procedure in the action,
                        and that from which it derived its distinctive name. Beyond this all is
                        conjecture, alike as to the nature and form of the action and the cases to
                        which it was applicable. Gaius says of the <hi rend="italic">legis actio
                            Sacramento</hi> that it was general, and that it was the procedure that
                        was to be resorted to where no other was prescribed by statute. There are,
                        however, nowhere indications of an express instruction that proceedings in
                        any particular case were to be <hi rend="italic">per judicis
                            postulationem.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>While it is impossible with certainty to trace the history of this procedure
                        to its first beginnings, yet the impression is general that it must have
                        originated in the regal period. It is commonly held to have been applicable
                        to the divisory actions, and some others triable by arbiters as directed by
                        the XII. Tables. Some eminent writers hold that it was employed in certain
                        actions in which equitable considerations were allowed to be taken into
                        account by the judge <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> the <hi rend="italic"
                            >actio fiduciae),</hi> and generally in so-called <hi rend="italic"
                            >jurgia</hi> as contrasted with <hi rend="italic">lites.</hi> But this
                        theory has many difficulties to contend with. It has no support from any
                        ancient writer, and it leads to the result that the courts by <hi
                            rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> had power to take into consideration
                        questions of <hi rend="italic">bona fides,</hi> which is not only in

                        <hi rend="italic"/> This, the youngest “ action of the law,” was introduced,
                        Gaius says, by the Silian law as a means of recovering a Uquid money debt
                            <hi rend="italic">(certa pecunia), and</hi> afterwards made available by
                        the Calpurnian law for enforcing personal claims (as distinguished from real
                        rights) for anything else definite and certain <hi rend="italic">(omnis res
                            certa),</hi> and in both its forms, therefore, essentially an action of
                        debt. The date of both enactments is matter of controversy, although there
                        is no question that the Silian was the earlier. Gaius says of it that its
                        purpose was far from obvious, as there was no difficulty in recovering money
                        either by a sacramental action or one <hi rend="italic">per judicis
                            postulationem.</hi> But it is probable, as above stated, that money due
                        under a nexal contract was recoverable by neither of these processes, but by
                        the much more summary one of <hi rend="italic">manus injectio,</hi> a
                        procedure which would be practically put an end to by the Poetilian law of
                        326 b.C. We are disposed to regard the <hi rend="italic">lex Silia</hi> and
                        the new procedure it authorized as a result of the change made by this
                        last-mentioned statute. To have put off a creditor for money lent either
                        with a sacramental action or one <hi rend="italic">per judicis
                            postulationem,</hi> would have been to deprive him of the advantages of
                            <hi rend="italic">manus injectio</hi> to a greater extent than was
                        called for. At any rate, it seems to have been provided by the Silian law
                        that, when a man disputed his liability for what was called <hi
                            rend="italic">pecunia certa credita,</hi> and forced his creditor to
                        litigation, the plaintiff was entitled, if he pleased, to require from him
                        an engagement to pay one-third more by way of penalty in the event of
                        judgment being against him, while the <hi rend="italic">soi-disant</hi>
                        creditor had similarly to undertake to pay as penalty the same amount in
                        ease of judgment in favour of the alleged debtor. Those engagements <hi
                            rend="italic">(sponsio cl restipulatio tertiae partis)</hi> were not
                        allowed in every case in which a definite sum of money was claimed <hi
                            rend="italic">per condictionem,</hi> but only when it was technically
                            <hi rend="italic">pcctmia credita.</hi> In Cicero’s time <hi
                            rend="italic">creditum</hi> might arise either from loan, stipulation or
                        literal contract <hi rend="italic">(expensilatio)',</hi> but the last dated
                        probably at soonest from the beginning of the 6th century, and stipulation
                        apparently was a result of the Silian law itself, so that the <hi
                            rend="italic">pecunia credita</hi> of this enactment can have referred
                        only to borrowed money. The same phrase, according to Livy, was employed in
                        the Poetilian law; it was thereby enacted, he says, that for <hi
                            rend="italic">pecunia credita</hi> the goods, not the body of the
                        debtor, ought to be taken in execution. A connexion, therefore, between the
                        Poetilian law and the disuse of the <hi rend="italic">nexum</hi> on the one
                        hand, and the Silian law and the introduction of the <hi rend="italic">legis
                            actio per condictionem</hi> on the other, can hardly be ignored, and
                        raises a probability that the latter statute was a consequence of the
                        former, and was passed immediately or soon after the year 326 B.C. In the
                        action on the Calpurnian law, it is probable that there was no penalty of a
                        third part on either side. A peculiarity of the <hi rend="italic">legis
                            actio per condictionem</hi> is that the plaintiff could when before the
                        magistrate refer the case to the defendant’s oath <hi rend="italic"
                            >(juramentum necessarium).</hi> Taking the oath involved absolution,
                        refusal involved condemnation.</p>
                   <p>Little is known of the procedure in this <hi rend="italic">legis actio,</hi>
                        for, in consequence of the loss of a leaf in the Verona MS., we are without
                        part of Gaius’s account of it. It got its distinctive name, he says, from
                        the <hi rend="italic">condictio</hi> or requisition made by the plaintiff on
                        the defendant, whom he had brought into court in the usual way, to attend
                        again on the expiry of thirty days to have a judge appointed. The procedure
                        on the reappearance of the parties on the thirtieth day (provided a
                        settlement had not been arrived at in the interval) varied according as the
                        action was (1) for a definite sum of money falling under the category of <hi
                            rend="italic">pecunia credita,</hi> or (2) for any other definite sum of
                        money or a definite thing or quantity of things. In the action for <hi
                            rend="italic">pecunia credita</hi> the <hi rend="italic">sponsio et
                            restipulatio tertiae partis</hi> were exchanged; and it is probable
                        that, if either party refused on the praetor’s command so to oblige himself
                        towards the other, judgment was at once pronounced in favour of the latter
                        without any remit to a <hi rend="italic">judex.</hi> How the issue was
                        adjusted when the sponsion and restipulation were duly given we are not
                        informed, but, judging by analogy from the procedure in an action for breach
                        of interdict under the iormular system, and on the broader ground that there
                        must have been machinery for a condemnation of the plaintiff on his
                        restipulation in the event of his being found in the wrong, it may
                        reasonably be concluded that there were in fact three concurrent issues sent
                        to the same <hi rend="italic">judex—</hi> the first on the main question,
                        the second on the defendant’s sponsion and the third on the plaintiff’s
                        restipulation. When a sum of money other than <hi rend="italic">pecunia
                            credita</hi> or a thing or quantity of things other than money was sued
                        for, those subsidiary issues were unnecessary if the view above expressed be
                        correct.</p>
                   <p>As Baron has demonstrated, it was not the usual practice to introduce any
                        words explanatory of the ground of indebtedness when the action was either
                        for money (other than <hi rend="italic">pecunia credita)</hi> or for a thing
                        or quantity of things. It might be loan, or bequest, or sale, or purchase,,
                        or delict, or unjustifiable enrichment, or any of a hundred <hi
                            rend="italic">causae \</hi> it would have to be stated of course before
                        the judge; but in the initial stage before the praetor and in the issue
                        all.that was necessary was the averment that the defendant was owing such a
                        sum of money or such a thing. It was for the judge to determine whether or
                        not the averment was established and, in certain cases, that non-delivery
                        was due to the fault of the defendant; the plaintiff, however, was bound to
                        make his averment good to the letter of his claim. In the event of the
                        plaintiff being successful in an action for <hi rend="italic">certa
                            pecunia,</hi> but delay was made by the defendant in satisfying the
                        judgment, execution followed in ordinary form. How the matter was arranged
                        in an action on the Calpurnian law for a <hi rend="italic">certa res</hi> is
                        not so obvious. What the plaintiff wanted was specific delivery or damages,
                        and by some the opinion is entertained that he formulated Jiis claim
                        alternatively. Of this there is no evidence; and Gaius’s statement that
                        under the system of the <hi rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> condemnation
                        was always in the <hi rend="italic">ipsa res, i.e.</hi> the specific thing
                        sued for, leads to the assumption that a judgment for the plaintiff, on
                        which specific implement failed, must have been followed by an <hi
                            rend="italic">arbitrium Uh aestimandae</hi> for assessment of the
                        damages in money, and that execution proceeded thereon as if the judgment
                        had been for a sum of money in the first instance. The general opinion,
                        however, is that the judge to whom the issue was remitted</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0551" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0592.jp2"/>
                   <p>assessed the damages himself and as a matter of course—that the instruction

                        <hi rend="italic"/> This “action of the law ” was ordinarily employed as a
                        means of execution against the body of a judgment-debtor or one who had
                        confessed liability in the first stage of a process. But, in certain cases,
                        it is conjectured, it was thought proper that a creditor should have a more
                        summary remedy than was afforded by a sacramental action or one <hi
                            rend="italic">per judicis postulationem,</hi> and he was allowed to
                        apprehend his debtor without any antecedent judgment or confession; in which
                        cases, if the debtor disputed liability, the question could be tried only in
                        proceedings at his instance, or sometimes at that of a third party on his
                        behalf, for a stay of execution. It will simplify matters, however, to
                        confine our attention to it in the meantime</p>
                   <p>as a means of execution against the body of a judgment-debtor.</p>
                   <p>Gaius’s description of it is very general; for details we are indebted
                        principally to the <hi rend="italic">Nodes Atticae</hi> of Aulus Gellius, in
                        an account which he gives (put into the mouth of Caecilius Africanus, a
                        well-known jurist of about the same time as Gaius, and a contemporary of his
                        own) of the provisions of the XII. Tables in reference to it. Africanus is
                        made to say that according to his belief <hi rend="italic">(opinor)</hi> the
                        words of the statute were these: “ For admitted money debts and in causes
                        that have been regularly determined by judgment <hi rend="italic">(aeris
                            confessi rebusque jure judicatis)</hi> there shall be thirty days’
                        grace. After that there may be <hi rend="italic">manus injedio.</hi> The
                        apprehending creditor shall then bring his debtor before the magistrate. If
                        he still fail to satisfy the judgment, and no <hi rend="italic">vindex</hi>
                        come forward to relieve him, his creditor may carry him home and put him in
                        chains. He may live at his own cost; if not, his creditor must give him
                        daily a pound of spelt, or more if he please.” Africanus continues <hi
                            rend="italic">narrolivé:</hi> “ There was still room for the parties to
                        come to terms; but, if they did not, the debtor was kept in chains for sixty
                        days. Towards the end of that time he was brought before the praetor in the
                            <hi rend="italic">comitium</hi> on three consecutive market-days, and
                        the amount of the judgment-debt proclaimed on each occasion. After the third
                        proclamation <hi rend="italic">capite poenos dotyil ”—</hi> what these words
                        mean will be considered in the sequel—“ or else he was sent across the Tiber
                        to be sold to a foreigner. And this capital penalty, sanctioned in the hope
                        of deterring men from unfaithfulness to their engagements, was one to be
                        dreaded because of its atrocity and of the new terrors with which the
                        decemvirs thought proper to invest it. For, if it was to more creditors than
                        one that the debtor had been adjudged, they might, if they pleased, cut up
                        and divide his body. Here are the words of the statute— <hi rend="italic"
                            >Tertiis nundinis partis secanto. Si phis minusve secuerunl, se fraude
                            esto? ”</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>Such is Gellius’s account of the provisions of the XII. Tables in reference
                        to this <hi rend="italic">legis adio,</hi> and he is to a considerable
                        extent corroborated by Quintilian, Tertullian and Dio Cassius. But it is to
                        be borne in mind that he does not vouch for its accuracy; the Tables were
                        already in his time matter of antiquity, and even the jurists knew little
                        about them beyond what was still in observance. That he has reproduced them
                        only partially seems almost beyond question; for in another chapter he
                        himself quotes a couple of sentences that are to all appearance from the
                        same context. We have to face, therefore, the extreme probability that the
                        record is incomplete and the possibility besides that it is not.literally
                        accurate. There is room for error, consequently, in two directions; but the
                        nature and effect of the procedure in . its main features .may be gathered
                        from the texts as they stand with reasonable certainty.</p>
                   <p>It was competent only after thirty days from the date of judgment or

                        least, an act of pure self-help. The debtor had at once to be brought before
                        the magistrate, in order that his creditor might solemnly go through, the
                        required formalities before he could carry him away and provisionally
                        confine him.in the domestic lock-up. It was this appearance before the
                        magistrate that made it a <hi rend="italic">legis adio.</hi> Such a course,
                        however, was avoided either (l) by instant payment or other implement of the
                        judgment or arrangement with the creditor, or (2) by the intervention of a
                            <hi rend="italic">vindex</hi> or champion. The position taken by the
                        latter was not. that either of a surety or of an attorney for the <hi

                        appeared rather as a con-troverier in his own name of the right of the
                        creditor to proceed further with his execution, on the ground that the
                        judgment was invalid. . This, might necessitate an action between the <hi

                        he had presumably relief against the original debtor who had been liberated
                        through his intervention. Failing a <hi rend="italic">vindex</hi> and

                        dealing with him for sixty days in the manner above described. On their
                        expiry, without any arrangement, there was a magisterial decree <hi
                            rend="italic">(addidio)</hi> awarding the debtor to his creditor.</p>
                   <p>What right did this <hi rend="italic">addidio</hi> confer upon the creditor?
                        The debtor, says Gellius, “ capite poenas dabat,” which he interprets as
                        meaning that his creditor might put him to death, the alternative being his
                        sale as a slave beyond the Tiber. There is, however, a diversity of opinion
                        among the modem writers as to the true meaning of these words. While some
                        hold, and rightly it is thought, that the.Gellian interpretation is correct,
                        others object to it as extravagant. It is objected to by Muirhead on the
                        ground, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> of its incredible severity in the
                        case of petty debtors. He holds that <hi rend="italic">capite poenas
                            dabat</hi> meant simply that the debtor “ paid the penalty with his
                        person,”.in contradistinction to “his means.” <hi rend="italic">Caput</hi>
                        is thus merely used in opposition to <hi rend="italic">bona.</hi> Even more
                        numerous are the writers who object to Gellius’s statement that the body of
                        the <hi rend="italic">addidus</hi> when killed might be cut in pieces where
                        there were several creditors. They hold that the words <hi rend="italic"
                            >partis secanto</hi> of the Tables referred not to the body but to the
                        belongings of the debtor,—that when there were concurrent creditors they
                        shared his <hi rend="italic">familia</hi> amongst them. <note

                        </note> But these views are, it is thought, somewhat fanciful refinements.
                            <hi rend="italic">Poena capitis</hi> always implies either death,
                        slavery or deprivation of citizenship; there is nothing more astonishing
                        in.a creditor’s right to kill his debtor than in a father’s right to kill
                        his child; and comparative law gives many instances, of a parallel kind, of
                        the harshness of primitive law to defaulting debtors. The <hi rend="italic"
                            >partis secanto</hi> was probably a relic of earlier times, and Gellius
                        admits that he never heard or read of a dissection having taken place.</p>
                   <p>The cruelties and indignities to which creditors subjected both their
                        judgment and nexal debtors led, as above noticed, to many a commotion in the
                        first two centuries of the Republic. The latter were probably much more
                        numerous than <hi rend="italic">the judicati,</hi> and, being in great part
                        tbe victims of innocent misfortune, it was the sufferings they endured at
                        the hands of relentless creditors that so often roused the sympathies and
                        indignation of the populace. But the judgment-debtors had suffered along
                        with them; and some of the provisions of the Poetilian law of 326 b.c.,
                        already mentioned, were meant to protect tbe former against the needless and
                        unjustifiable severity that had characterized their treatment by their
                        creditors. The <hi rend="italic">manus injedio</hi> itself was not
                        abolished, nor the possible intervention of a <hi rend="italic"
                            >vindex-,</hi> neither were the <hi rend="italic">domum dudio</hi> that
                        followed, and the provisional imprisonment with the light chains, authorized
                        by the Tables while it lasted; nor apparently was the formal <hi
                            rend="italic">addidio</hi> of the debtor to his creditor when the sixty
                        days had expired without arrangement. But after addiction, if it was for
                        nothing more than civil debt, there were to be no more dungeons and stripes,
                        fetters and foot-blocks; the creditor was to treat his debtor and his
                        industry as a source of profit that would in time diminish and possibly
                        extinguish his indebtedness, rather than as an object upon which he might
                        perpetrate any cruelty by way of punishment. Although the edict of P.
                        Rutilius of 107 B.c. provided a creditor with machinery
                        for debtors, but this view has, it is thought, insurmountable objections to overcome.

                   <p>attaching the estate of his debtor, he had still the alternative of
                        incarceration. This might be avoided under the Julian law of <hi
                            rend="italic">cessio bonorum</hi> by the debtor's making a complete
                        surrender of his goods to his creditor; but, failing such surrender,
                        incarceration continued to be resorted to even under the legislation of
                        Justinian. During the Empire, of course, it was not by <hi rend="italic"
                            >manus injectio</hi> that the incarceration was affected; for it went
                        out of use with the definitive establishment of the formular system of
                        procedure.</p>
                   <p>It was as directed against judgment and nexal debtors that <hi rend="italic"
                            >manus injectio</hi> was of most importance and chiefly made its mark in
                        history. But there were other cases in which it was resorted to under
                        special statutory authority, where a remedy seemed advisable more sharp and
                        summary than that by ordinary action. In some of these it was spoken of as
                            <hi rend="italic">manus injectio pro judicato {i.e.</hi> as if upon a
                        judgment), in others as simple <hi rend="italic">manus injectio {manus
                            injectio pura).</hi> Jn the first the arrestee was not allowed to
                        dispute his alleged indebtedness in person; he could do so only through a
                            <hi rend="italic">vindex;</hi> and if no one intervened for him in that
                        character he was carried off and dealt with by his arresting creditor as if
                        a judgment had been obtained against him. In the second he was not required
                        to find a <hi rend="italic">vindex,</hi> but might himself dispute the.
                        verity of the charge made against him, under penalty, however, as is
                        generally supposed (though it is disputed), of a duplication of his
                        liability if he failed in his contention. By. a <hi rend="italic">lex

                        this <hi rend="italic">manus injectio pura</hi> was substituted for that <hi

                        arrest was neither judgment nor so-called <hi rend="italic">depensum,

                        debtor, who failed to relieve the former within six months of such payment.

                            sacramenti</hi> thq <hi rend="italic">vis civilis et festucaria</hi> was
                        a reminiscence of the <hi rend="italic">vera solida vis</hi> with which men
                        settled their disputes about property in the earliest infancy of the
                        commonwealth. <hi rend="italic">Manus injectio</hi> was a survival from
                        times when the wronged was held entitled to lay hands upon the wrongdoer,
                        and himself subject him to punishment; custom and legislation intervened
                        merely to regulate the conditions and mode of exercise of what essentially
                        was still self-help. In <hi rend="italic">pignoris capio</hi> self-help was
                        likewise the dominant idea. It may be fairly enough described by the English
                        legal term distress—the taking by one man of property belonging to another
                        in satisfaction of or in security for a debt due by the latter which he had
                        failed to pay. The seizure, however, did not proceed upon any judgment, nor
                        did it require the warrant of a magistrate; it might be resorted to even in
                        the absence of the debtor, and on a <hi rend="italic">dies nefastus;</hi>
                        but it required to be accompanied by certain words of style, spoken probably
                        in the presence of witnesses. It was only in a few exceptional cases that it
                        was competent, in some by force of custom, in others by statute, nearly all
                        of which seem to be given by Gaius, <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        being of a military, religious or fiscal character. What was the procedure,
                        and what its effects, are far from certain. Jhering, founding on some
                        expressions of Cicero's, conjectures that, whether the debt was disputed or
                        not, the distrainer could neither destroy nor sell nor definitely
                        appropriate his <hi rend="italic">pi gnus</hi> without magisterial
                        authority,—that in every case he was bound to institute proceedings in
                        justification of his caption, and to take in them the position of plaintiff.
                        The idea is ingenious, and puts the <hi rend="italic">pignoris capio</hi> in
                        a new and interesting light. It makes it a summary means of raising a
                        question of right for whose judicial arbitrament no other process of law was
                        open,—with the additional advantage that it secured instant satisfaction to
                        the raiser of it in the event of the question being determined in bis
                        favour. If against him, the inevitable result, in substance at least, must
                        haye been a judgment that he bad no right to retain his pledge, with
                        probably a finding</p>
                   <p>that he was further liable to its owner in the value of it, as a punishment

                        quasi-judicial agencies. The supreme magistrate was frequently called upon
                        to intervene in matters brought under his cognizance by petition or
                        complaint, in which his. aid was sought not so much to protect a vested
                        right of property or claim, as to maintain public order, or to prevent the
                        occurrence or continuance, of a. state of matters that might prove
                        prejudicial to family or individual interests. The</p>

                        himself; and his finding, unless, it was a dismissal of the complaint or
                        petition, was embodied in an order <hi rend="italic">{decretum, inter
                            -dictum)</hi> which it was for him to enforce by such means as he
                        thought fit,— <hi rend="italic">manu militari,</hi> or by fine or
                        imprisonment. Some jurists are disposed to give a very wide range to this
                        magisterial intervention. One of its most important manifestations was in
                        connexion with disputes about the occupancy of the public domain lands.
                        These did not belong in property to the occupants, so that an action founded
                        on ownership was out of the question. But, as the occupancy was not only
                        recognized, but sanctioned by the state, it was right, indeed necessary in
                        the interest of public order, that it should be protected against
                        disturbance. In the measures resorted to for its protection Niebuhr
                        recognized the origin of the famous possessory interdict <hi rend="italic"
                            >uti possidetis</hi> ; and, although opinions differ as to whether
                        protection of the better right or prevention of a breach of the peace was.
                        what primarily influenced the magistrate’s intervention, there is, apart
                        from .some distinguished exceptions, a pretty general accord in accepting
                        this view. Another illustration of this magisterial intervention is to be

                        of administration a man who was squandering his family estate and reducing
                        his children to penury; a third presents itself in the removal of a tutor

                        of this magisterial intervention, which manifested itself in very various
                        directions; and it is easy to see how largely such procedure might be
                        utilized for remedying the grievances of persons who, from defect of
                        complete legal title, want of statutory authority, or otherwise, were not in
                        a position to avail themselves of the “ actions of the law.”</p>

                        remitted to find for plaintiff or defendant according to. circumstances. .
                        The recuperators were generally three, sometimes five, sometimes perhaps
                        still more, numerous, but always in odd number; but whether the nationality

                        importance. The campaigns in which Rome was engaged until the end of the
                        First Punic War absorbed all its energies. But after that time the influx of
                        strangers, and their settlement in the city for purposes of trade, became
                        very rapid—not only of Latins and other allies, but Greeks, Carthaginians

                        appointed superintended single-handed the administration of justice, alike
                        between citizens and foreigners. But with the altered condition of things in
                        the beginning of the 6th century, and the influx of strangers which has
                        already been alluded to, the work seems to have been found Joo onerous for a
                        single magistrate, and a second praetor was created. The date is generally
                        assumed to have been about the year 242 b.c.; Pomponius says distinctly that
                        the creation of the new office was rendered necessary by the increase of the
                        peregrin population of Rome, and that the new magistrate got the name of <hi
                            rend="italic">praetor peregrinus</hi> because his principal duty was to
                        dispense justice to this foreign element. After the submission of Sicily and
                        Sardinia the number of the praetors was increased to four and after the
                        conquest of Spain to six; Sulla raised the number to eight, and Caesar
                        eventually to sixteen. But all the later creations were for special
                        purposes; the ordinary administration of justice within the city was left
                        with the representatives for the time of the two earliest, who came to be
                        usually distinguished as <hi rend="italic">praetor qui inter civcs jus
                            dicit</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">urbanus)</hi> and <hi rend="italic"

                            rend="italic">peregrinus).</hi> It would be going too far to speak of
                        the latter as the principal author of the <hi rend="italic">jus
                            gentium;</hi> for a large proportion of the actions for enforcing <hi
                            rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> rights were civil, not honorary—a fact
                        which proves that the rights they were meant to protect and enforce had
                        their origin in the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> although moulded to
                        meet new requirements by tacit consuetude and the agency of the jurists. But
                        even in this view the peregrin praetor must have had a powerful influence in
                        giving shape and consistency to the rising jursiprudence, by means of the
                        formulae he adjusted for giving it practical effect.</p>

                        as regards citizens it in no wise abolished the actions of the law but
                        merely made the formulary procedure alternative to them, according as the
                        praetor, on the representation of the parties, might determine in each case;
                        formulae, in his view, being first made compulsory, subject to a few
                        exceptions, by the Julian laws. This is a probable theory and is now adopted
                        by many recent writers. The main purpose of the statute seems to have been
                        to empower the urban praetors to adapt existing remedies to altered
                        circumstances, and <hi rend="italic">inter alia to</hi> fashion new actions
                        on the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> for the use of the peregrins, to
                        whom the <hi rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> were rarely, if at all,
                        available. But, whatever may have been its actual provisions, the result was
                        the adoption of a procedure which gradually supplanted that by the actions
                        of the law, which was much more pliant than the latter, and whose
                        characteristic was this—that, instead of the issue being declared by word of
                        mouth by the parties, and requiring as a rule to embody with perfect
                        accuracy the statutory provision on which it was based, it was formulated in
                        writing under the direction of the praetor, in the shape of an instruction
                        to the judge to inquire into the merits of the dispute, with power to
                        condemn or acquit according to his finding. A statute was necessary for
                        accomplishing such an innovation, not only because the existing procedure
                        was directly prescribed by statute, but ako among other reasons because the
                            <hi rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> were favourites of the pontifical
                        colleges (being often profitable to them), and any attempt by the
                        magistrates to dispense with them would have been opposed by these powerful
                        bodies. It is now the dominant opinion among modern writers, and it seems
                        based on reasoning which cannot be gainsaid, that even prior to the <hi
                            rend="italic">lexAebutia</hi> written formulae were employed in
                        practice, particularly if not exclusively in the peregrin praetor’s court,
                        and that one of the objects of the statute was to legalize similar procedure
                        in civil actions. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial"

                        difficult to see by what means the rights and obligations of peregrins in
                        their transactions <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> or with citizens could
                        have been enforced, as civil actions, save perhaps in exceptional cases
                        where by treaty they enjoyed <hi rend="italic">jus commercii,</hi> were not
                        open to them. Written instructions to the recuperators or other judges for
                        trying suits in which a peregrin was a party would be a practical necessity,
                        for these judges would have to decide according to <hi rend="italic">jus
                            gentium,</hi> whose rules would probably be strange to them, and their
                        instructions would therefore have to be precise and definite. Verbal
                        instructions. would have led to miscarriages of justice. From this point of
                        view we can see how the peregrin praetor became the primary organ in
                        developing <hi rend="italic">jus gentium.</hi> But there is some reason for
                        holding that the urban praetor had. also, before the Acbutian law,
                        occasionally exercised his imperium by granting actions <hi rend="italic">in
                            factum,</hi> and in this way perhaps enforced ti number of contracts and
                        other obligations in which elements of equity and good faith were present
                        and. which the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> left remediless. Actions of
                        this kind among <hi rend="italic">rives</hi> would be in the nature of <hi
                            rend="italic">arbitria</hi> accepted voluntarily by the parties.. The
                        latter view certainly explains several apparent anomalies in the later law,
                        for which no other good explanation can be found, as, for instance, the fact
                        that in deposit and commodate actions <hi rend="italic">in factum</hi> as
                        well as <hi rend="italic">in jus</hi> might be brought. Also the <hi

                            rend="italic">fiducia</hi> can in this way be explained. It also serves
                        to throw light upon the development of some of the <hi rend="italic">bonae

                        face with laws and institutions in many respects differing from those of
                        Rome. Political considerations dictated how far these were to be respected,
                        how far subverted. In</p>
                   <p>some provinces, more especially the Eastern ones, it was thought unnecessary
                        to do more than supplement the existing system by the importation of
                        doctrines of the <hi rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> and the procedure of the
                        praetor’s edicts; while in others, in which it was deemed expedient to
                        destroy as rapidly as possible all national feeling and every national
                        rallying point, a Romanizing of all their institutions was resorted to, even
                        to the extent of introducing some of the formal transactions which
                        previously had been confined to citizens. But in either case there was a
                        reflex action. The native institution had to be studied, its advantages and
                        disadvantages balanced, the means considered of adapting it to the
                        praetorian procedure, and the new ideas so presented as to make them
                        harmonize as far as possible with the old. All this was a training of no
                        small value for those who, on their return to Rome, were to exercise an
                        influence on legislation and the administration of the law. They brought
                        back with them not merely an experience they could not. have obtained at
                        home, but sometimes a familiarity with foreign institutions that they were
                        very willing to acclimatize in Italy. Rome thus enriched its law from the
                        provinces, deriving from them its emphyteutic tenure of land, its hypothec,
                        its Rhodian law of general average and a variety of other features that were
                        altogether novel. They were sanctioned by tacit recognition, by edicts of
                        the praetors and in other ways; but, in whatever way received, they were
                        indirectly fruits of provincial conquest.</p>

                        fraught with such disastrous results in the later days of the Republic. The
                        private law was influenced by it to a considerable extent, alike in those
                        branches which regulated the domestic relations and those which dealt with
                        property and contract.</p>
                   <p>The ever-increasing disregard of the sanctity of the marriage tie is one of
                        those features in the history of the period which strikes even the most
                        unobservant. While from the first the law had denounced causeless separation
                        and visited it with penalties, in principle it maintained the perfect
                        freedom of repudiation on the part of the husband. With the simple and
                        frugal habits of the first five centuries of Rome, and the surveillance of
                        the <hi rend="italic">consilium domeslicum,</hi> the recognition of this
                        principle produced no evil results; family misunderstandings were easily
                        smoothed over, and divorces were of rare occurrence. But during the 6th and
                        7th centuries of the Republic a change to looser morals took place, and the
                        family council lost much of its control. This was doubtless largely due to
                        the decay of hand marriages, wives consequently remaining outside their
                        husband’s <hi rend="italic">familia</hi> and often holding</p>

                   <p>This looseness of the marriage bond, as was naturally to be expected, had
                        its effect on the other family relations. The right of children to take
                        their father’s inheritance began to be lightly esteemed. The law—or rather
                        the interpretation put upon the <hi rend="italic">uti legassit</hi> of the
                        XII. Tables—had empowered him testamentarily to disinherit them, or in
                        instituting them to limit their right to a mere fraction of the inheritance;
                        but it was assumed that this power would be exercised with discretion and
                        only when justified by circumstances. But in the later days of the Republic,
                        amid the slackened ties of domestic life, paternal as well as conjugal duty
                        seems to have often been lost sight of, and children were disinherited or
                        cut off with a nominal share of the inheritance in order that a stranger
                        might be enriched. This led to the recognition by the centumviral court,
                        without apparently any legislative enactment or praetor’s edict to warrant
                        it, of what was called the <hi rend="italic">querela inafficiosi

                        may for a time have been hesitating and uncertain, yet early in the empire,
                        through means of this <hi rend="italic">querela,</hi> the rule came to be
                        established that every child was entitled, notwithstanding the terms of his

                        the private law owed much to legislation. The vast majority of the
                        enactments of the time referred to by the historians dealt with
                        constitutional questions, municipal and colonial government, agrarian
                        arrangements, fiscal policy, sumptuary prohibitions, criminal and police
                        regulations, and other matters that affected the public law rather than the
                        private.. Those of the latter class mentioned by Gaius and Ulpian in their
                        institutional works barely exceed a score in number; and of these not above
                        half a dozen can be said to have exercised a permanent influence on the
                        principles (as distinguished from the details) of the law. Most of them were
                        enactments of. the <hi rend="italic">concilium plebis</hi> or of the <hi

                        <hi rend="italic"/> The practice of propounding edicts was very ancient, and
                        had been followed by kings and consuls long before the institution of the
                        praetorship. It was one of the most obvious ways of exercising the <hi
                            rend="italic">imperium</hi> with which the supreme magistrate was
                        invested—to lay an injunction upon a citizen and enforce his obedience, or
                        to confer upon him some advantage and maintain him in its enjoyment. It was
                        one of the ways in which public order was protected where there had been no
                        invasion of wnat the law regarded as a right, and.where, consequently, there
                        was no remedy by action. That the earlier edicts of trie praetors were of
                        this character—issued, that is to say, with reference to particular cases,
                        and.what afterwards came to be called <hi rend="italic">edicta
                            repentina</hi> or <hi rend="italic">prout res incidit posita—</hi> there
                        is little reason to doubt. In time a new class of edicts.appeared which got
                        the name of <hi rend="italic">edicta perpetua</hi> (or <hi rend="italic"
                            >perpetuae jurisdictionis causa pro-posita)—</hi> -announcements by the
                        praetor, published on his album (as the white boards displayed for the
                        purpose in the forum were called), of the remedy he would be prepared to
                        grant on the application of any one alleging that the state of facts
                        contemplated had arisen. The next year’s praetor was free to adopt the
                        edicts of his predecessor or not; but it was usual for him to do so if they
                        had tieen found beneficial in practice, he adding to them new provisions
                        suggested by demands made upon past praetors for <hi rend="italic">edicta
                            repentina,</hi> but which tney had not generalized, or even proposing
                        for acceptance some remedy entirely of his own devising. As each new praetor
                        entered upon office he announced his jurisdictional programme—his <hi
                            rend="italic">lex annua,</hi> as it was called from this particular
                        point of view, by far the greater part of it <hi rend="italic">tralaticium,
                            i.e.</hi> transmitted from his predecessors, and only a few paragraphs,
                        diminishing in number.as time progressed, representing his own contribution.
                        And so it went on in the first years of the Empire, until the praetorian
                        function was eclipsed by the imperial; and at last, after having, by
                        instruction of Hadrian, been subjected to revision, and consolidated along
                        with the Aedilian Edicts, by Salvius Julianus, it was, as will be noticed
                        below, sanctioned as binding on the whole Empire. The term “ Edict ” is
                        applied both to tne single edicts and also to the whole body of them
                        together.</p>
                   <p>There is some reason for supposing that the edict attained considerable
                        proportions in the time of Cicero; for he mentions that, whereas in his
                        youth the XII. Tables had been taught to the boys in school, in his later
                        years these were neglected, and young men directed instead to the praetor’s
                        edicts for their first lessons in law. Of a few of them the date and
                        authorship, are known with tolerable precision; but of the history of the
                        majority, including some of the most important, such as those introducing
                            <hi rend="italic">restitutio in integrum</hi> on the ground of lesion
                        through error, absence, minority ana the like, ana those revolutionizing the
                        law of succession, we are to a great extent in the dark. It was one of the
                        great advantages the edicts had over legislative enactments that they might
                        be dropped, resumed or amended by a new praetor according to his judgment of
                        public requirements. For the edict was <hi rend="italic">viva vox juris
                            civilis—</hi> intended to aid, supplement and correct it in accordance
                        with the ever-changing estimate of public necessities; and this would have
                        been impossible had its provisions from the first been as stereotyped as
                        they became by the consolidation in the time of Hadrian.</p>
                   <p>The edict seems to have contained two parts—the first what may be called the
                        edicts proper, and the second styles of actions, &amp;c., whether
                        derived from the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> or from the <hi
                            rend="italic">jus praetorium.</hi> The styles or formulae for civil
                        actions were published without any corresponding edict; for praetorian
                        actions styles were published appropriate to their corresponding edicts.
                        There were also independent formulae for interdicts, processual
                        stipulations, &amp;c. The contents of the edicts proper were in detail
                        very various, but all devoted to an exposition of the ways in which the
                        praetor meant to exercise his jurisdiction during his year of office. They
                        were not didactic or dogmatic formulations of law, but rather announcements
                        of what remedy he would grant in such and such circumstances, or direct
                        orders to do or prohibitions against, doing certain things. A party claiming
                        an action or whatever else it might be under any of them did so not of
                        right, as he would have done had his claim had a statutory or customary
                        foundation, but of grace—on the strength of the praetor’s promise to grant
                        him what he claimed and make the grant effectual. That was why originally
                        such an action had to be raised and concluded within the particular
                        praetor’s year of office—a rule which in time, by abuse, was converted into
                        the somewhat different one that a purely praetorian action <hi rend="italic"
                            >(i.e.</hi> not originally of the <hi rend="italic">jus. civile)</hi>
                        had to be raised within a year of the occurrence to which it referred.</p>
                   <p>As already observed, the praetor’s edicts proceeded upon lines of equity;
                        that is to say, they were directed against the strictness and formalism of
                        the jurisprudence of the XII. Tables. Such may be said to have been the
                        general tendency of the edicts as a whole.</p>
                    <pb xml:id="eb11-23-r04-0556" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0597.jp2"/>
                   <p>But it was the tendency of the whole jurisprudence of the time, and by no
                        means peculiar to the praetorian creation. Nowhere in the texts are the
                        praetors spoken of as the mouthpieces of equity as distinguished from law.
                        Such a distinction recurs frequently in Cicero; he identifies <hi
                            rend="italic">aequitas</hi> with the spirit of a law or agreement, and
                            <hi rend="italic">jus</hi> with its letter, but it is in order to sin£
                        the praises not of the praetors but of the pleaders who maintained the
                        former as against the latter, and of the judges who were persuaded by their
                        arguments. Much of what was contained in the edict might quite as well have
                        been embodied in statute, and we know that in time statute came to its aid;
                        witness a very remarkable provision of it— “ I will give <hi rend="italic"
                            >honor um possessio</hi> as may be enjoined by statute, whether comitial
                        enactment or scnatusconsult.”</p>
                   <p>Of the edicts of the peregrin praetor and their relation to that of his
                        urban colleague little is known. That they differed in some respects there
                        can be no doubt, for.in the <hi rend="italic">lex Rubria</hi> (49 <hi
                            rend="smallcaps">b.c.)</hi> for settling the government of Cisalpine
                        Gaul the magistrates are directed, with reference to a certain action, to
                        formulate it in the way prescribed in the edict of the peregrin praetor. The
                        latter, therefore, must to some extent have been in advance of that of the
                        urban praetor, probably in this respect, that, being prepared primarily for
                        the regulation of questions affecting non-citizens, it more thoroughly than
                        the other avoided formalities that were competent only to citizens, and thus
                        to a greater extent simplified procedure, The edicts of the provincial
                        governors must have varied according to circumstances, being in all cases
                        composites of provisions, more or less numerous, borrowed from the edicts of
                        the praetors and additions suggested by the peculiar wants of the different
                        provinces for which they were framed <hi rend="italic">(provinciate genus
                            edicendi).</hi> As for those of the curule aediles, who amongst other
                        duties were charged with the supervision of markets, their range was very
                        limited; their most important provisions having reference to open sales of
                        slaves, horses and cattle, and containing regulations about the duties of
                        vendors exposing them, and their responsibility for latent faults and vices.
                        They also had cognisance of certain delicts committed in the streets and
                        markets. As the aediles had no <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> their
                        restricted <hi rend="italic">jus edicendi</hi> may have been conferred on
                        them by custom or statute.</p>

                        philosophical jurists in defining the ground of the authority of
                        consuetudinary law, there is no room to dispute the importance of its
                        contributions to every system of jurisprudence ancient and modern. The men
                        who first drew, accepted and endorsed a bill of exchange did as much for the
                        law as any lawgiver has ever accomplished. They may or may not have acted on
                        the advice of jurists; but, whether or not, they began a practice which grew
                        into custom, and as such was recognized by the tribunals as a law-creating
                        one—one conferring rights and imposing obligations. There is much of
                        this—far more probably than is commonly imagined</p>
                   <p>—in the history of every system of law.</p>
                   <p>In Rome the process was sometimes wonderfully expeditious; witness what
                        Justinian narrates of the introduction and recognition of testamentary
                        trusts and of codicils to last wills, both in the time of Augustus. It can
                        hardly be doubted that the literal contract <hi rend="italic">per
                            expensilationem</hi> originated in the same way, probably in the end of
                        the 5th or the beginning of the 6th century of the city. The keeping of
                        domestic account-books may have been enjoined and enforced by the censors;
                        but it was custom, and neither statute nor praetor’s edict, that made an
                        entry in them to another person’s debit creative of a claim against the
                        latter for <hi rend="italic">certa pecunia credita,</hi> that might be made
                        effectual by an action under the Silian law. It must have been in exactly
                        the same way that <hi rend="italic">mutuum,</hi> formless loan of money,
                        came to be regarded as the third variety of <hi rend="italic">certa credita

                        this could not have been attained without the co-operation of the But then
                        each case was as a rule tried by a single private</p>

                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="123"> It was not
                            until the Empire that a “ series rerum perpetuo similiter judicatarum,”
                            a uniform series of precedents, was held to be law. During the Republic
                            a judge was much freer, and not only entitled but bound to decide
                            according to his own notion of what was right, taking the risk of
                            consequences if his judgment was knowingly contrary to law. </note>
                        <hi rend="italic"/> He had simply to decide whether in his view
                        expensilation or formless loan created such an obligation as was covered by
                        the words <hi rend="italic">pecuniam dari oportere.</hi> There may for a
                        time have been a divergent practice, contradictory findings, as Cicero says
                        there were in his day upon the question whether <hi rend="italic"
                            >aequitas</hi> or <hi rend="italic">jus strictum</hi> was to be applied
                        to the determination of certain matters; but the eventual unanimity of
                        judicial opinion in one direction was but the expression of the general
                        sentiment of the citizens, of whom the <hi rend="italic">judices</hi> were
                        the representatives.</p>
                   <p>These are but examples of the way in which consuetudinary law was
                        constructed. It required the combined action of the laity and <hi
                            rend="italic">the judices,</hi> both at times acting under professional
                        advice; in some cases even that of the praetors was necessary. It would have</p>
                   <p>been impossible, for instance, to have introduced the consensual contracts
                        into the Roman system and determined what were the obligations they imposed
                        on either side, without magisterial cooperation in framing the formulae that
                        were to be submitted to the judges. Taking the action on sale as an
                        illustration, the formula substantially was this: “It bein£ averred that the
                        defendant sold such or such a thing to the plaintiff, whatever, judge, it
                        shall appear that the defendant ought in good faith to give to or do for the
                        plaintiff in respect thereof, in the money equivalent thereof condemn the
                        defendant; otherwise, acquit him.” It is very manifest that the free hand
                        here given to the judge must immensely have facilitated the reception of
                        customary doctrine into the law. The judge was to a great extent the
                        spokesman of the forum; his judgment was formed in accordance with current
                        public opinion, which he had ample opportunity of gauging; it was the
                        reflection of that general sentiment of right, which, phrase it how we may,
                        is the real basis of all customary law. And so in an action for establishing
                        a right of property in a <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi.</hi> The formula
                        was very simple: “ If it appear that such or sucn a thing belongs to the
                        plaintiff in quiritary right, then, judge, whatever be its value for the
                        plaintiff, in that condemn the defendant; should it appear otherwise, acquit
                        him.” The primary duty of a judge on sucn a remit was to determine whether
                        the title on which the plaintiff founded his pretensions gave him a right
                        that came up to property; and it can hardly be disputed that it was by the
                        decisions of a series of judges, in a series of such actions, that the long
                        list of natural inodes of acquiring property given, by Justinian under
                        technical names was gradually brought into view. Those decisions, whether
                        upon the obligations of a vendor, direct or indirect, or upon the
                        sufficiency of a title founded on by a party averring a right of property by
                        natural acquisition, doubtless were in many cases arrived at under
                        professional advice, and were in all cases embodied in judgments. But that
                        does not in the least deprive the doctrine deduced from them of its
                        character of customary law. It was not until the Empire that the opinions of
                        the jurists submitted to a judge <hi rend="italic">jresponsa
                            prudentium)</hi> were invested with binding authority. During the
                        Republic, if a judge deferred to them, it was simply because he regarded
                        them as in consonance with well-qualified public opinion; and what a series
                        of consistent judgments <hi rend="italic">of this sort</hi> built up was in
                        the strictest sense a law based on consuetude.</p>
                   <p>As regards the professional jurists in particular it has already been
                        observed that, according to the testimony of the Roman historians, the law
                        was a monopoly of the patricians down at least to the middle of the 5th
                        century of the city. Livy goes so far as to speak of it as <hi rend="italic"
                            >in penetralibus pontificum repositum,</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>—among the secrets of the pontifical college. It was so doubtless during the
                        regal period. But after the publication of the XII. Tables this could be the
                        case only in a qualified sense, the pontiffs becoming the official
                        interpreters of that which in the letter was patent to the world. The <hi

                            rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> from its rightful owner, but simply by
                        tradition instead of by mancipation or cession in court, he did not acquire
                            <hi rend="italic">dominium ex jure Quiriiium,</hi> and the transferrer
                        remained undivested. The result, was that the latter was in law entitled to
                        raise a <hi rend="italic">rei vindicaiio</hi> and oust the transferee whose
                        money he might have in his pocket,while if a third party had obtained
                        possession of the thing, but in such a way as not to be amenable to an
                        interdict, the transferee could have no effectual vindication against him,
                        as he was not in a position to prove <hi rend="italic">dominium ex jure
                            Quiriiium.</hi> The first difficulty was overcome by the <hi
                            rend="italic">exceptio rei venditae et traditae,</hi> also a praetorian
                        remedy, and probably older than the Publician’; to the transferrer’s
                        vindication on the strength of his unextinguished quiritary right the
                        transferee pleaded sale and delivery as an effectual praetorian defence. .
                        But, when a third party was in possession, and the transferee by simple
                        delivery had to take the initiative, the position was more complicated. Such
                        third party might be in. perfect good faith; ne might even have acquired
                        from the original transferrer and fortified his acquisition with a formal
                        conveyance. But that was no sufficient reason in equity why he should be
                        allowed to defeat the prior right of the original transferee, who, if he had
                        possessed for the requisite period of usucapion before the third party came
                        upon the scene would have cured the defect of the informal delivery and
                        acquired an unassailable quiritary right. So the praetor announced in his
                        edict that, if a man came to him and represented that he had bought a <hi
                            rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> from its owner, and had had it delivered
                        to him, but had lost possession within the period of usucapion, he (the
                        praetor) would allow him a vindication embodying a fiction of completed
                        usucapion (fn/ra), with which he might proceed either against the
                        transferrer or any third party withholding the thing</p>
                   <p>in question.</p>
                   <p>The publication of such an edict and the formula of the action based upon it
                        (which, though of praetorian origin, was in many respects dealt with as just
                        a variety of the <hi rend="italic">rei vindicaiio}</hi> had almost the same
                        effect as if the legislature had directly enacted that in future delivery of
                        a <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> in pursuance of a sale or other good
                        cause would confer a right of ownership in it even before usucapion .had
                        been completed. Till completed, however, the transferee was not quiritary
                        owner: the thing in question was only <hi rend="italic">in bonis,</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">** of</hi> his belongings,” and the legal title, though an
                        empty one— <hi rend="italic">nudum jus Quiriiium—</hi> remained in the
                        transferrer; it was only with the completion of the usucapion that it became
                        the transferee’s <hi rend="italic">pleno jure.</hi> The inevitable result of
                        the recognition of this tenure <hi rend="italic">in bonis</hi> was that
                        mancipation came to be regarded in many cases as an unnecessary formality;
                        and the marvel is that it continued to hold its ground at all. The
                        explanation may be that it afforded a substratum for and gave force of law
                        to the <hi rend="italic">verba nuncupata</hi> that accompanied the <hi
                            rend="italic">negotium per aes et libram;</hi> and, although many of
                        these might quite well be thrown into the form of stipulations, j yet there
                        were others that it. may have been thought safer to leave to take effect
                        under the provisions of the earlier law.</p>
                   <p>The second case that was met by the Publician Edict—whether as originally
                        published or by an amendment of it cannot be determined—was that of the <hi
                            rend="italic">bona fide</hi> transferee of a thing by purchase or other
                        sufficient title who, having lost possession of it before usucapion, found
                        to his cost that the transferrer hadnot been itsowner.that noownership
                        therefore had been transmitted to him (the transferee), and that
                        consequently he was not in a position to raise a vindication with its
                        averment of <hi rend="italic">dominium ex jure Quiritium.</hi>
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="127"> This case is
                            the only one alluded to by Justinian <hi rend="italic">{Inst.</hi> iv.

                            bonitarian property, which had, he says, become in practice a mockery
                            (Cod. vii. 25), and so it was unnecessary for him to mention the other.

                        extended, and the difficulty of proving property (as distinguished from <hi

                        received considerable attention, and formed the subject of a series of
                        legislative enactments for limiting a surety’s liability; while that of
                        agency, which was sparingly admitted in Rome, had a valuable contribution
                        from the praetorian edict in the recognition of a man’s liability, more or
                        less qualified, for the contractual debts of his <hi rend="italic"
                            >iiliifamilias</hi> and slaves, as also, and without qualification, for

                        the matter of obligations generally was greatly facilitated by the
                        praetorian simplification of procedure and the introduction of new forms of
                        actions—the instruction to a judge, “ Whatever in respect thereof the
                        defendant ought to give to or do for the plaintiff, in. that , condemn him,”
                        preceded by a statement of the cause of action, giving wide scope for the

                   <p>The origin of the verbal contract of stipulation and its actionability under
                        the Silian and Calpurnian laws have already been explained. It. was
                        theoretically a formal contract, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> creative of
                        obligation on the strength of the formal question and answer interchanged by
                        tne parties, even though no substantial ground of debt might underlie it;
                        but in time it became the practice to introduce words—the single word <hi
                            rend="italic">recte</hi> was enough—excluding liability in case of
                        malpractice <hi rend="italic">{clausula doli);</hi> and finally even that
                        became unnecessary when the praetors had introduced the general <hi
                            rend="italic">exceptio doli,</hi> pleadable as an equitable defence to
                        any personal action. And it was essentially productive only of unilateral
                        obligation, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the respondent in the interrogatory
                        alone incurred liability; if mutual obligations were intended it was
                        necessary that each should promise for his own part, with the result that
                        two. contracts were executed which were perfectly independent. Originally
                        the only words that could be employed were <hi rend="italic">spondes?</hi>
                        on the one side, <hi rend="italic">spondeo</hi> on the other; and in this
                        form the contract wasjwris <hi rend="italic">civilis</hi> and competent only
                        to citizens (and noncitizens enjoying <hi rend="italic">commercium ?).</hi>
                        In time the words <hi rend="italic">promittis?</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">iromitto,</hi> came to be used alternatively. They were,
                        eventually at cast, competent to peregrins as. well as to citizens, although
                        that may not have been until the stipulation had become of daily use amongst
                        the former in the still simpler phraseology <hi rend="italic">dabis? dabo,
                            facies? faciam.</hi> Originally competent only for the creation of an
                        obligation to pay a definite sum of money, and afterwards one for delivery
                        of a specific thing other than money, the contract came in time, by the
                        simplification of the words of interrogatory and response and especially by
                        the substitution of the conditions of the formular system for <hi
                            rend="italic">the legis actiones oi</hi> the Silian and Calpurnian laws,
                        and the introduction of the <hi rend="italic">actio ex stipulate</hi> to
                        meet cases of indefinite promise—to be adaptable to any sort of unilateral
                        engagement, whether initiated by it or only confirmed. It. was of immense
                        service too outside the ordinary range of contract in. what were called
                        necessary (in contradistinction to voluntary) stipulations, of which a

                        all directions advantage was taken of it to bind a man by formal contract
                        either to do or to refrain from doing what in many cases he might already be
                        bound <hi rend="italic">ipso jure</hi> to do or to abstain from doing, and

                        </note> Notwithstanding the prolific literature of which it has been the
                        subject, it must be admitted that in many points our knowledge of it is
                        incomplete and uncertain. The prevalent opinion, formed before the discovery
                        of the Verona MS. had made known Gaius’s description of it, and almost
                        universally adhered to ever since, is that such contracts were created by
                        entries in the account-books which the censors insisted that all citizens of
                        any means should keep with scrupulous regularity. They arc often alluded to
                        by the lay writers; but the text principally relied on is what remains of
                        Cicero’s speech for the player Roscius. From the tenor of the argument in
                        that case, and incidental remarks elsewhere, the conclusion has been formed
                        that a citizen who made an entry in his <hi rend="italic">codex—</hi>
                        whether of the nature of a cash-book or a ledger is much disputed—to the
                        debit of another, thereby made the latter his debtor for a sum recoverable
                        by an <hi rend="italic">actio certae creditae pecuniae,</hi> Gaius in his
                        description of the contract does not mention the <hi rend="italic"
                            >codices\</hi> but his account is not inconsistent with the notion that
                        the entries <hi rend="italic">(nomina)</hi> of which he speaks were made in
                        them. He says that those entries were of two sorts, <hi rend="italic">nomina
                            arcaria</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nomina transscripticia.</hi> The
                        former were entries of cash advances; and of them he observes that they did
                        not create obligation, but only served as evidence of one already created by
                        payment to and receipt of the money by the borrower. These entries were
                        posted periodically (usually each month) from a day-book <hi rend="italic"
                            >(adversaria,),</hi> and there were distinct pages in the codex for what
                        was thus paid out of the <hi rend="italic">area (expensum)</hi> and what was
                        paid in. Of the <hi rend="italic">nomina transscripticia</hi> Gaius says
                        that there were two varieties, the entry transcribed from thing to person
                        and that transcribed from one person to another, and that both of them were
                        not probative merely but creative of obligation. The first was effected by a
                        creditor (A) entering to the credit of his debtor (B) the liquidated amount
                        of what the latter was already owing as the price of something purchased,
                        the rent of a house leased, the value of work done, or the like, and then on
                        the opposite page of the codex debiting him with same sum as <hi
                            rend="italic">expensum.</hi> The second was effected by A transcribing
                        B’s debt in a similar way to ¿he debit of a third party (C), hitherto a
                        debtor of B’s, and who consented to the transaction—A at the same time
                        crediting B with the sum thus booked against C, and B in his books both
                        crediting C with it <hi rend="italic">(acceptilatio)</hi> and marking it as
                        paid to A <hi rend="italic">(ex-pensilalio).</hi> These <hi rend="italic"
                            >nomina transscripticia</hi> were purely fictitious entries so far as
                        any passing of money was concerned, though they had to be made by the
                        direction <hi rend="italic">(jussus)</hi> of the person made chargeable as
                        debtor. Corresponding entries in the debtor’s own</p>
                   <p>codex, though usual, do not seem to have been necessary.</p>
                   <p>All this at first sight seems just a series of book-keeping operations. But
                        it was much more than that for the Roman citizens who first had recourse to
                        it. There was a time, as formerly stated, when sale, and lease and the like,
                        so long as they stood on their own merits, created no obligation enforceable
                        at law, however much it might be binding as a duty to Fides or (as moderns
                        would say) in the forum of conscience; to found an action at law it required
                        to be clothed in some form approved by the <hi rend="italic">jus
                            civile.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">nexum</hi> may possibly have been one
                        of those forms, the vendee or tenant being fictitiously dealt with as
                        borrower of the price or rent due under his purchase or lease; the
                        stipulation was another, the obligation to pay the price or rent being made
                        legally binding by its embodiment in formal question and answer. But
                        stipulation was competent only between persons who were face to face,
                        whereas expensilation was competent also as between persons at a distance
                        from each other. This of itself gave expensilation— which, originally at
                        least, was as much a <hi rend="italic">negotium juris' civilis</hi> as the
                            <hi rend="italic">sponsio</hi> —one advantage over stipulation. But it
                        had also a further advantage, which was not affected by the subsequent
                        recognition of the real and consensual contracts as productive of legal
                        obligation on their own merits: it enabled subsequent transcription of debts
                        from one person to another to be effected. This last must have been of
                        infinite convenience in commerce, not only by enabling traders to dispense
                        with a reserve of coin, but by obviating the risks attending the transit of
                        money over long</p>
                   <p>distances. It was this that led, as Thcophilus says was the case, to the
                        conversion even of stipulatory obligations into book-debts; it was not that
                        thereby the creditor obtained a tighter hold over his debtor, but that an
                        obligation was obtained from him which in a sense was negotiable and
                        therefore more valuable. But in other respects it was much more restricted
                        than stipulation. Thus it only applied to money debts; it did not admit of
                        conditions (though it did admit of a term); and it was never available to
                        peregrins, though the Sabinians proposed that transcription <hi
                            rend="italic">a re in personam</hi> should be binding on them.</p>
                   <p>The evolution of the four purely consensual contracts—sale, location,
                        partnership and mandate—supplies matter for one of the most interesting
                        chapters in the whole history of the law. <hi rend="sub">Coa</hi> .</p>
                   <p>But, as it is impossible in such an article as this to attempt <hi
                            rend="italic">sensual</hi> to mark the successive stages in the progress
                        of all of them, <hi rend="italic">contracts.</hi> we shall confine ourselves
                        to sale. The others did not and could not follow identically the same
                        course: location ran most nearly parallel with sale; but partnership and
                        mandate, from their nature, not only started at a different point from the
                        other two, but reached the same goal with them—that of becoming productive
                        of obligation simply on the strength of consent interchanged by the
                        parties—by paths that were sometimes far apart. Nevertheless, a sketch of
                        the history of the origin of the contract of sale may be sufficient to
                        indicate generally some of the milestones that were successively passed by
                        all four. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="131"> The
                            literature on the history of the contract of sale is profuse, but mostly
                            scattered in periodicals and much of it fragmentary. It may be enough to
                            refer to Bechmann, <hi rend="italic">Der Kauf nach Gemeinem Recht</hi>

                        meaning no more than barter; for <hi rend="italic">emere</hi> originally

                            >ot sa/e</hi> for a time have been a very usual article of exchange on
                        one side, and then came raw metal weighed in the scales. But it was still
                        exchange, instant delivery of goods on one sideagainst simultaneous delivery
                        of so many pounds weight of copper on the other. With the reforms of Servius
                        Tullius, as we have seen, came the distinction between <hi rend="italic">res
                            mancipi</hi> and <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi,</hi> and with it a
                        regulated mancipation of the former. It was still barter; but along with it
                        arose an obligation on the part of the transferrer of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >res mancipi</hi> to warrant the transferee against eviction—a warranty
                        that was implied in the mancipation. Whether this rule obtained from the
                        first or was the growth of custom it is impossible to say; but it is
                        probable that it was the XII. Tables which fixed that the measure of the
                        transferrer’s liability to the transferee in the event of eviction should be
                        double the amount of the price. Equally impossible is it to say when the
                        practice arose of embodying declarations, assurances and so forth in the
                        mancipation <hi rend="italic">(leges mancipii),</hi> which were held binding
                        on the strength of the <hi rend="italic">negotium juris civilis</hi> in
                        which they were clothed. They received statutory sanction in the Tables, in
                        the words already referred to more than once—“ cum nexum faciet
                        mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto,” which means in effect “
                        whatever shall by word of mouth be declared by the parties in the course of
                        a transaction <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram</hi> in definition of its
                        terms shall be law as between them.”</p>
                   <p>The substitution, by or soon after the decemvirs, of coined money, that was
                        to be counted, for rough metal that had been weighed, converted the object
                        of transfer on one side into price <hi rend="italic">(pretium),</hi> as
                        distinguished from article of purchase <hi rend="italic">(merx)</hi> on the
                        other; and sale thus became distinct from barter. In contemplation of the
                        separation of the mancipation and the price-paying, and the transition of
                        the former into a merely imaginary sale, the decemvirs enacted that,
                        mancipation notwithstanding, the property of what was sold should not pass
                        to the purchaser until the price had been paid or security by sureties <hi
                            rend="italic">(vaaes)</hi> given for it to the vendor; and it was
                        probably bv the interpretation of the pontiffs that to this was added the
                        rule—that until the price was paid no liability for eviction should attach
                        to the transferrer (or <hi rend="italic">auctor).</hi> The reason perhaps of
                        the provision on this point in the XII. Tables was that a vendor who had
                        niancipated or delivered a thing sold by him before receiving the price had
                        no action to enforce payment of the latter; and in such circumstances it was
                        thought but right to give him the opportunity of getting back the thing
                        itself by a real action. It might be, however, that the price had been paid,
                        and yet the vendor refused to mancipate. It was long, apparently, before the
                        purchaser could in such a case compel him to do so. After the introduction
                        of the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per condictionem</hi> he (the
                        purchaser) had undoubtedly the power to recover the money on the ground of
                        the vendor’s unjustifiable enrichment—that the latter had got it for a
                        consideration which had failed <hi rend="italic">(causa data, causa non
                            secuta)</hi> ; and it is possible that before that he had a similar
                        remedy <hi rend="italic">per judicis postulationem</hi> or by an action <hi
                            rend="italic">in factum.</hi>

                   <p>Down to this point, therefore, say the beginning of the 6th century, there
                        were several obligations consequent on sale of a <hi rend="italic">res

                        all regarded as of a delictual character; the obligations were binding, not
                        in virtue of the sale <hi rend="italic">per se,</hi> but of the transaction
                            <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram</hi> superinduced upon it; and, if
                        the vendor had at any time to return the price on failure to manci-pate what
                        he had sold, it was not because he had committed a breach of contract, but
                        because he had unjustly enriched himself at the purchaser’s expense.</p>
                   <p>In sales of <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi,</hi> just as in those of <hi
                            rend="italic">res mancipi,</hi> a vendor who had been incautious enough
                        to deliver his wares before he had been paid, or had got stipulatory
                        security for the price, or had converted it into a book-debt, might recover
                        them bv a real action if payment was unduly delayed; while the purchaser who
                        had paid in advance but failed to get delivery might also get back his money
                        from the. vendor on the pica of unwarrantable enrichment. But, as
                        mancipation was, as is generally supposed, incompetent for carrying the
                        property, some other machinery had to be resorted to than that of the copper
                        and the scales for imposing upon the vendor an obligation of warranty
                        against eviction, defects and so forth. What it was is a question much
                        controverted among modern writers. It may be that, until trade began to
                        assume considerable proportions, and when a transaction was between
                        citizens, a purchaser was content to rely partly on the honesty of his
                        vendor, partly on the latter’s knowledge that he ran the risk of an action
                        for theft if what he sold belonged to another, <note anchored="true"

                        view that it was the popularization of the stipulation that facilitated the
                        development of sale into a <hi rend="italic">bonaefidei</hi> contract.</p>

                        </note> The stipulation <hi rend="italic">habere licere</hi> occurs in</p>
                   <p>Varro, in a collection of styles of sales of sheep, cattle, &amp;c.,
                        some of which he says were abridgments of those of M. Manilius, who was
                        consul in the year 149 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> It was the guarantee
                        of the vendor of a <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi,</hi> or even
                        occasionally of a <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> sold without
                        mancipation, that the purchaser should be maintained in possession of what
                        he had bought; it entitled him to reparation on eviction, measured not by
                        any fixed standard but according to the loss he had 'sustained. It cannot
                        have been introduced, therefore, until after the <hi rend="italic">Lex
                            Aebutia</hi> and the formulation by the praetor of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >actio ex stipulate.</hi> The <hi rend="italic">stipulatio duplae</hi>
                        was one binding the vendor for double the price in case of eviction, and was
                        entered into not only where no mancipation of a <hi rend="italic">res
                            mancipi</hi> took place or one which might be challengeable for
                        invalidity, but also where valuable <hi rend="italic">res nec mancipi</hi>
                        were sold.</p>
                   <p>The idea of the <hi rend="italic">stipulatio duplae</hi> may have been
                        borrowed from the <hi rend="italic">duplum</hi> incurred by a vendor on the
                        eviction of a purchaser acquiring a thing by mancipation; for one of its
                        earliest manifestations was in the edict of the curulc aediles, who insisted
                        on it from persons selling slaves, probably because the dealers were for the
                        most part foreigners, and therefore unable to complete their sales <hi
                            rend="italic">per aes et libram.'</hi> Judging from Varro, it was a form
                        of stipulation against eviction that in his time was used only in sales of
                        slaves, although he adds that by agreement of parties it might be limited to
                        a <hi rend="italic">simplum.</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>There were also stipulations against vices in the object sold. We learn from
                        Varro—wnat is also indicated in various passages of Plautus—that the vendor
                        at the same time and in the body of the same <hi rend="italic">stipulatio
                            duplae</hi> guaranteed that the sheep or cattle he was selling were
                        healthy and of a healthy stock and free from faults,</p>
                   <p>and that the latter had not done any mischief for which their owner could be
                        held liable in a noxal action; and similarly that a slave sold was healthy
                        and not chargeable for any theft or other offence for which the purchaser
                        might have to answer. If any of these guarantees turned out fallacious, the
                        purchaser had an <hi rend="italic">actio ex stipulate</hi> against the
                        vendor: " Whereas the plaintiff got from the defendant a stipulation that
                        certain sheep he bought from him were healthy, &amp;e. [repeating the
                        words of guarantee], and that he, the plaintiff, should be free to hold them
                            <hi rend="italic">(habere licere),</hi> whatever it shall appear that
                        the defendant ought in respect thereof to give to or do for the plaintiff,
                        in the value thereof, judge, condemn him; otherwise, acquit him.” It is an
                        observation of Bekker’s <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                            type="authorial" n="135"> Bekker, <hi rend="italic">Aktionen</hi>
                            (1871), Ì. 156 seq. and 314 seq. </note> that the <hi rend="italic"
                            >actio empti</hi> in its original shape was just a simplification of the
                            <hi rend="italic">actio ex stimulate</hi> on a vendor's guarantees; the
                        stipulations to which we have been alluding had become such unfailing
                        accompaniments of a sale as to be matters of legal presumption, the result
                        being that the words "whereas this plaintiff <hi rend="italic">bought</hi>
                        from the defendant the sheep about which the action has arisen ” were
                        substituted in the <hi rend="italic">demonstratio</hi> (as the introductory
                        clause of the formula was called) for the detailed recital of what had been
                        stipulated. Bekker justifies this by reference to the language of Varro, who
                        seems to include under the words <hi rend="italic">emptio, venditio</hi> not
                        merely the agreement to buy and sell but also the stipulations that usually
                        went with it.</p>
                   <p>The introduction of an <hi rend="italic">actio empti</hi> in this shape,
                        however, was far from the recognition of sale as a purely consensual
                        contract. If the price was not paid at once, the purchaser gave his
                        stipulatory promise for it, or got some one on whom the vendor placed more
                        reliance to do so for him, or else the vendor made a booK-debt of it; and,
                        if it had to be sued for, it was in all these cases by a <hi rend="italic"
                            >condiclio certae pecuniae</hi> and not by an action on the sale. If the
                        price was paid but the thing purchased not delivered, the only remedy open
                        to the purchaser was to get back his money by the same condict ion, unless,
                        indeed, the guarantee <hi rend="italic">habere licere</hi> was held to cover
                        delivery, in which case the purchaser might obtain damages in an <hi
                            rend="italic">actio ex stipulate</hi> under the name of <hi
                            rend="italic">actio empti.</hi> But this <hi rend="italic">actio
                            empti,</hi> whether raised on the ground of non-delivery, eviction or
                        breach of some other warranty, was really an action on the verbal contracts
                        ihat had accompanied the sale—a <hi rend="italic">strictum jus</hi> action
                        in which the judge could not travel beyond the letter of the engagements of
                        the purchaser. In the latter years of the Republic, and probably a little
                        before the time of Q. Mucius Scaevola, it was a <hi rend="italic">bonae
                            fidei</hi> action. How had the change come about? A single case of
                        hardship may have been sufficient to induce it, such as the defeat of a
                        claim for damages for eviction on the ground that the stipulatory guarantee
                        had been accidentally overlooked. Ulpian says: “As the <hi rend="italic"
                            >stipulatio duplae</hi> is a thing of universal observance, action on
                        the ground of eviction will lie <hi rend="italic">ex empto</hi> if perchance
                        the vendor of a slave have failed to give his stipulatory guarantee, for
                        everything that is of general custom and practice ought to be in view of the
                        judge in a <hi rend="italic">bonae fidei judicium.</hi>
                        <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="136"> Ulp., “ Lib.

                   </p>
                   <p>Very little was required to convert the <hi rend="italic">stricti juris
                            actio empti,</hi> really nothing more than an <hi rend="italic">actio ex
                            stipulate,</hi> into a <hi rend="italic">bonae fidei</hi> one—simply the
                        addition by the praetor of the words “ on considerations of good faith ” <hi
                            rend="italic">(ex fiae bona)</hi> to the “ whatever the defendant ought
                        to give to or do for the plaintiff.” The effect, however, was
                        immeasurable—not that it did away with the practice of stipulatory
                        guarantees, for Varro wrote after the time of Q. Mucius (who speaks of the
                        action on sale as a <hi rend="italic">bonae fidei</hi> one), and references
                        to them are abundant in the pages of the classical jurists; but it rendered
                        them in law unnecessary’. It made sale a purely consensual contract in
                        which, in virtue of the simple agreement to buy and sell, all the
                        obligations on either side that usually attended it were held embodied
                        without express formulation or (still less) stipulatory or literal
                        engagement. And, in instructing the judges to decide in every case between
                        buyer and seller suing <hi rend="italic">ex empto</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                            >ex vendito</hi> on principles of good faith, it really empowered them
                        to go far beyond “ general custom and practice,” and to take cognisance of
                        everything that in fairness and equity and common sense ou^ht to influence
                        their judgment, so as to enable them freely to do justice between the
                        parties in any and every question that might directly or indirectly arise
                        out of their relation as seller and buyer. <note anchored="true"

                        actionable, under the Silian and Calpurnian laws respectively, by a
                        stipulation contemporaneous with the loan. With the rise of <hi
                            rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> loan became actionable on its own
                        merits—that is to say, the advance and receipt of money as a loan of itself
                        laid the borrower under a <hi rend="italic">stricti juris</hi> obligation to
                        repay it, even though no stipulatory engagement had intervened; the <hi
                            rend="italic">res—</hi> in this case the giving and receiving <hi
                            rend="italic">mutui causa—</hi> completed the contract. The obligation
                        that arose from it was purely unilateral, and enforceable, where the loan
                        was.of money, by the same action— <hi rend="italic">certae pecuniae
                            creditae</hi> —as stipulation and literal contract; and so strictly was
                        it construed that interest on the loan was not claimable along with it, the
                            <hi rend="italic">res</hi> given and received being the full measure of
                        the obligation of repayment. The other three—commodate, deposit and
                        pledge—became independent real contracts much later than <hi rend="italic"
                            >mutuum,</hi> possibly not all at the same time, and none of them
                        apparently until very late in the Republic. All of them, of course, had been
                        long known as transactions of daily life; the difficulty is to say when they
                        first became actionable in the urban praetor’s court (for in transactions
                        with peregrins actions <hi rend="italic">in factum</hi> would doubtless be
                        granted), and under what guise.</p>
                   <p>It is impossible within the space at our command to criticize the various
                        theories entertained of their vicissitudes, for they necessarily vary to
                        some extent in regard to each. We must content ourselves, therefore, with
                        the simple statement that eventually, and within the period with which we
                        are now dealing, they came to be recognized as independent real contracts,
                        the <hi rend="italic">res</hi> by which they were completed being the
                        delivery of a thing by one person to another for a particular purpose, on
                        the understanding that it was to be returned when that purpose was served.
                        And it is to be noted that, while <hi rend="italic">mutuum</hi> transferred
                        the property of the money lent, the borrower being bound to return not the
                        identical coins but only an equal amount, in pledge it was only the
                        possession that passes, while in commodate and deposit the lender or
                        depositor retained both property and (legal) possession, the borrower or
                        depositary having nothing more than the natural detention. In all but <hi
                            rend="italic">mutuum,</hi> therefore, there was trust; the holder was
                        bound, to an extent varying according to circumstances, to care for what he
                        held as if it were his own, and entitled to be reimbursed for outlay on its
                        maintenance—bound to return it, yet excused if his failure to do so was due
                        to a cause for which in fairness he could not be held responsible.
                        Consequently the actions on these three, contracts, differing from that on
                            <hi rend="italic">mutuum,</hi> were all <hi rend="italic">bonae

                        lead to the conclusion that the series of provisions in regard to it which
                        we find in the Julian consolidation of the Edict were the work of a
                        succession of praetors, some of them probably not under the Republic but
                        under the Empire; but it will be convenient to give here a general view of
                        the subject as a whole, disregarding the consideration that some of its

                        gradually became a momentous reform; and it is probable that this first step
                        was the announcement by some praetor that, where there was dispute as to an
                        inheritance, and a testament was presented to him bearing not fewer seals
                        than were required by law, he would give possession of the goods of the

                            after year by a series of praetors. Gaius (ii. 119) speaks of seven at

                            doubt that his was originally the seventh. </note> In this as it stands
                        there is nothing but a regulation of possession of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >bona</hi> of the inheritance pending the question of legal right. Just
                        as between two parties contending about the ownership of a specific thing in
                        a <hi rend="italic">rei vindicatio</hi> the praetor first settled the
                        question of interim possession, so did he promise to do here when a question
                        was about to be tried about the right to an inheritance (« <hi rend="italic"
                            >de hereditate ambigitur).</hi> It was a provisional arrangement merely,
                        and very necessary in view of the state of the law which permitted a third
                        party, apart from any pretence of title, to step in and complete a <hi
                            rend="italic">usucapiopro herede</hi> by a year’s possession of the
                        effects of the inheritance. Even at the time when the Edict was closed it
                        was not necessarily more than a provisional grant; for, if heirs-at-law of
                        the deceased appeared and proved that, although the testament bore on the
                        outside the requisite number of seals, yet in fact some solemnity of
                        execution, such as the /awi/tac <hi rend="italic">venditw</hi> or <hi
                            rend="italic">testamenti nuncupatio,</hi> had been omitted, the grantee
                        had to yield them up the possession that had been given him pending inquiry.
                        It was only by a rescript of Antoninus Pius that it w <hi rend="sup">r</hi>
                        as declared that a plea by the heir-at-law of invalidity of a testament on
                        the ground of defect of formalities of execution might be defeated by an <hi
                            rend="italic">exceptio doli,</hi> on the principle that it was contrary
                        to good faith to set aside the wishes of a testator on a technical objection
                        that was purely formal. Thus was the <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio
                            secundum tabulas, i.e.</hi> in accordance with a testament, from being
                        originally one in aid of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> in course of
                        time converted into one in contradiction of it. That the motives and
                        purposes of the series of praetors who built up the law of <hi rend="italic"
                            >bonorum possessio</hi> must have varied in progress of years is
                        obvious; and, once the machinery had been invented, nothing was easier than
                        to apply it to new ideas. The praetor could not make a man heir—that he
                        always disclaimed; but he could give a man, whether heir or not, the
                        substantial advantages of inheritance, and protect him in their enjoyment by
                        praetorian remedies. He gave him. possession of the goods of the deceased,
                        with summary remedies for ingathering them, which, once in his hands, would
                        become his in quiritarian right on the expiry of the period of usucaption;
                        and subsequently, by interpolation into the formula of a fiction of
                        heirship, he gave him effectual personal actions against debtors of the
                        deceased, rendering him liable in the same way to the deceased’s creditors.</p>
                   <p>Another variety of the <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio</hi> was that <hi
                            rend="italic">contra tabulas—</hi> in opposition to the terms of a
                        testament. If a testator had neither instituted nor expressly disinherited a
                        son who was one of his <hi rend="italic">sui heredes,</hi> then his
                        testament was a nullity, and the child passed over had no need of a
                        praetorian remedy. Where <hi rend="italic">sui heredes</hi> other than sons
                        were passed over the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> upheld the will but
                        allowed them to participate with the instituted heirs by a sort of accrual.
                        But the Edict went further; for, if the institute was a stranger, <hi
                            rend="italic">i.e.</hi> was not a person in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >potestas</hi> of the testator with the child passed over, then, on the
                        petition of the latter, the praetor gave him and any other <hi rend="italic"
                            >sui</hi> concurring with him possession of .the whole estate, of tne
                        deceased as on intestacy, the institute being left with nothing more than
                        the empty name of heir. Another application of the <hi rend="italic">bonorum
                            possessio contra tabulas</hi> was to the case of emancipated children of
                        the testator. By the Jus <hi rend="italic">civile</hi> he was not required
                        to institute or disinherit them; for by their emancipation they had ceased
                        to be <hi rend="italic">sui heredes,</hi> and had lost that interest in the
                        family estate which was the reason why they had to be mentioned in the
                        testament of their <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias.</hi> The praetors—
                        although probably not until the empire, and when the doctrines of the <hi
                            rend="italic">jus naturale</hi> were being more freely recognized—put
                        them on the same footing as unemancipated children, requiring that they also
                        should be either instituted or disinherited, and giving them <hi
                            rend="italic">bonorum possessio</hi> if they were not. It was <hi
                            rend="italic">contra tabulas</hi> in the sense that it displaced the
                        instituted heirs either wholly or partially— wholly when the institutes were
                        not children of the deceased, partially when they were. In the latter case,
                        at least when <hi rend="italic">sui</hi> were affected by it, the grant of
                            <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio</hi> was under the equitable
                        condition that the grantees should collate or bring into partition all their
                        own acquisitions since their emancipation.</p>
                   <p>The third variety of <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio</hi> was that
                        granted <hi rend="italic">ab intestato.</hi> The rules of the <hi
                            rend="italic">jus civile</hi> in reference to succession on intestacy
                        were, as we have seen, extremely strict and artificial. They admitted
                        neither emancipated children nor agnates who had undergone <hi rend="italic"
                            >capitis deminutio;</hi> they admitted no female agnate more remote than
                        a sister; if the nearest agnate or agnates declined, the right did not pass
                        to those of the next degree; mere cognates, kinsmen of the deceased who were
                        not agnates , <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> grandchildren or others related to
                        him through females and agnates <hi rend="italic">capite minuti,</hi> were
                        not admitted at all; while a wife had no share unless she had been <hi
                            rend="italic">in manu</hi> of the deceased and therefore <hi
                            rend="italic">filiae loco.</hi> All these rules the praetors amended,
                        and so far paved the way for the revolution in the law of intestate
                        succession which was accomplished by Justinian.</p>
                   <p>They established four orders or classes of heirs, (i) Displacing the <hi
                            rend="italic">sui heredes</hi> of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi>
                        they gave the first place to descendants <hi rend="italic">(liber i),</hi>
                        including in the term all those whom the deceased would have been bound
                        either by the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> or the Edict to institute or

                        intestate, under their old name of <hi rend="italic">legitimi heredes.</hi>
                        (3) Under the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> on failure of agnates (and
                        of the <hi rend="italic">gens</hi> where there was one), the succession was
                        vacant and fell to the fisc, unless perchance it was usucapted by a stranger
                        possessing <hi rend="italic">pro herede.</hi> The frequency of such
                        vacancies was much diminished by the recognition by the praetors of the
                        right of cognates to claim <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio</hi> in the
                        third place. Who they had primarily in view under the name of “ cognates ”
                        it is impossible to say.</p>
                   <p>The epithet is most frequently applied by modern writers to kinsmen related
                        through females; but in its widest sense it included all kinsmen without
                        exception, and in a more limited sense all kinsmen not entitled to claim as
                        agnates. There were included amongst them therefore—although it is very
                        probable that the list was not made up at once, but from time to time by the
                        action of a series of praetors—not merely kinsmen related through females
                        (who were not agnates), but also agnates of a remoter degree who were
                        excluded as such because the nearest agnates in existence had declined,
                        persons w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ho had been agnates but by reason of <hi
                            rend="italic">capitis minutio</hi> had lost that character, female
                        agnates more distantly related than sisters, and children of the intestate
                        who at the time of his death were in an adoptive family. All these took
                        according to proximity, but not beyond the sixth degree and the children of
                        a second cousin in the seventh. (4) Finally, the claim passed to the
                        survivor of husband and wife, assuming always that their marriage had not
                        involved <hi rend="italic">manus.</hi> This list constituted the praetorian
                        order of succession on intestacy among freeborn citizens. The praetorian
                        order of succession to freedmen and <hi rend="italic">emancipate</hi> was
                        necessarily different, the patron or quasi-patron taking the place of
                        agnates; but it is too detailed and complex to be gone into here.</p>
                   <p>All these <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessions</hi> had to be formally
                        petitioned for. In that <hi rend="italic">ab intestato</hi> descendants were
                        allowed a year for doing so, while other persons were limited to 100 days,

                        those entitled in the first had expired, and so on. The grant was always
                        made at the risk of the petitioner; nothing was assured him by it; it might
                        turn out real and substantial <hi rend="italic">(cum re)</hi> or merely

                        witnessed the perfection of Roman jurisprudence and the commencement of its
                        decline. During that time the history of the law presents no such great
                        landmarks as the enactment of the XII. Tables, the commencement of a
                        praetor’s edict, the recognition of simple consent as creative of a
                        contractual bond, or the introduction of a new system of' judicial
                        procedure; the establishment of a class of patented jurists speaking as in a
                        sense the mouthpieces of the prince, and the admission of all the free
                        subjects of the Empire to the privileges of citizenship, are about the only
                        isolated events to which one can point as productive of great and lasting
                        results. There were, indeed, some radical changes in particular
                        institutions, such as the caduciary legislation of Augustus, intended to
                        raise the tone of domestic morality and increase fruitful marriages, and the
                        legislation of the same emperor and his immediate successor for regulation
                        of the status of enfranchised slaves; but these, although of vast importance
                        in themselves, and the first of them influencing the current of the law for
                        centuries, yet left upon it no permanent impression. It was by much less
                        imposing efforts that it attained the perfection to which it reached under
                        the sovereigns of the Scvcran house —a steady advance on the lines already
                        marked out in the latter years of the Republic. The sphere of the <hi

                        one after another of the formalities of the strict <hi rend="italic">jus

                        <hi rend="italic"/> It is sometimes said that the notion of a <hi
                            rend="italic">jus naturale</hi> as distinct from the/us <hi
                            rend="italic">gentium</hi> was peculiar to Ulpian, and that it found no
                        acceptance with the Roman jurists generally. But this is inaccurate.
                        Justinian, indeed, has excerpted in the <hi rend="italic">Digest</hi> and
                        put in the forefront of his <hi rend="italic">Institutes</hi> a passage from
                        an elementary work of Ulpian’s, in which he speaks of a <hi rend="italic"
                            >jus naturale</hi> that is common to man and the lower animals, and
                        which is substantially instinct. This is a law of nature of which it is
                        quite true that we find no other jurist taking account, and it may be
                        attributed to a habit, specially noticeable in Ulpian’s writings, of making
                        tripartite classifications. But though the classical jurists are undoubtedly
                        indistinct in their conceptions about the matter, many of them refer again
                        and again to <hi rend="italic">jus naturale</hi> in the sense of law based
                        on natural reason; and Gaius is the only one (Justinian following him) who
                        definitely, though not consistently, makes it synonymous with <hi
                            rend="italic">jus gentium.</hi> There can be no question that the latter
                        was much more largely imbued with precepts of natural law than was the <hi
                            rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> but it seems incorrect to say that
                        natural law and <hi rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> were identical; it is
                        enough to cite but one illustration, pointed out again and again in the
                        texts: while the one admitted the legality of slavery, the other denied it.
                        While the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> studied the interests only of
                        citizens, and the <hi rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> those of freemen
                        irrespective of nationality, the law of nature had theoretically a wider
                        range and took all mankind within its purview. The doctrine of the <hi
                            rend="italic">jus gentium</hi> agreed in this respect with that of the
                            <hi rend="italic">jits civile</hi> —that a slave was nothing but a
                        chattel; yet we find the latter, when tinctured with the <hi rend="italic"
                            >jus naturale,</hi> recognizing many rights as competent to a slave, and
                        even conceding that he might be debtor or creditor in a contract, although
                        his obligation or claim could be given effect to only indirectly, since he
                        could neither sue nor be sued. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        in the principate, led the praetors to place emancipated children on a
                        footing of equality with unemaneipated in the matter of succession, and to
                        admit to succession collateral kindred through females as well as those
                        related through males; and that, in the reigns of Hadrian and Marcus
                        Aurelius respectively, induced the senate to give a mother a preferred right
                        of succession to her children, and <hi rend="italic">vice versa.</hi> It was
                        respect for the second that led to the recognition of the validity of what
                        was called a natural obligation,—one that, because of some defect of form or
                        something peculiar in the position of the parties, was ignored by the <hi
                            rend="italic">Jus civile</hi> and incapable of being made the ground of
                        an aetion for its enforcement, yet might be given effeet to indirectly by
                        other equitable remedies. Regard for the third was nothing new in the
                        jurisprudence of the period; the Republic had already admitted it as a
                        principle that a man was not to be unjustifiably enriched at another’s cost;
                        the jurists of the empire, however, gave it a wider application than
                        beforehand used it as a key to the solution of many a difficult question in
                        the domain of the law of contract. As for the fourth, it was one that had to
                        be applied with delicacy; for the <hi rend="italic">voluntas</hi> could not
                        in equity be preferred to its manifestation to the prejudice of other
                        partieswho in good faith had aeted upon the latter. We have many evidences

                        being held in eheek by considerations of individual interest and general
                        utility.</p>
                   <p>A remark of Voigt’s on the subject is well worthy of being kept in view,
                        that the risk which arose from the setting up of the precepts of a
                        speculative <hi rend="italic">jus naturale,</hi> as derogating from the
                        rules of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,</hi> was greatly diminished
                        through the position held by the jurists of the early Empire. Their <hi

                        organs of the state, so that, in introducing principles of the ins <hi

                            bonum,</hi> they at the same moment defined them and gave them the force
                        of law. They were, he says, " philosophers in the sphere of law, searchers
                        after the ultimate truth; but, while they—usually in reference to a concrete
                        case—sought out the truth and applied what they had found, they combined
                        with the freedom from constraint of speculation, the life-freshness of
                        practice, and the power of assuring the operativeness of their abstract
                        propositions.” <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="145"

                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Influence of Constitutional Changes.</hi> —The changes in
                        the constitution aided not a little the current of the law. Men of foreign
                        descent reached the throne and recruited the senate, sometimes proud indeed
                        of the history and traditions of Rome, yet in most cases free from prejudice
                        in favour of institutions that had nothing to recommend them but their
                        antiquity. Military life, for obvious reasons, had not the same attractions
                        as during the Republic; there was no longer a tribunate to which men of
                        ambition might aspire; the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> soon ceased to
                        afford an outlet for public eloquence; so that men of education and position
                        had all the more inducement to devote themselves to the conscientious study
                        and regular practice of the law. This was greatly encouraged by the aetion
                        of Augustus in creating a class of, so to say, patented jurists privileged
                        to give answers <hi rend="italic">ex auctoritate principis</hi> to questions
                        submitted to them by the magistrates ana judges. It was still more so
                        perhaps by Hadrian’s reorganization of the imperial privy council, wherein a
                        large proportion of the seats were assigned to jurists of distinction.
                        Several of the, emperors had lawyers amongst their most intimate and trusted
                        friends. Again and again the office of praetorian prefect, the highest next
                        the throne, was filled by them; Papinian, Ulpian and Paul all held it in
                        their time. Jurisprudence, therefore, was not merely an honourable and
                        lucrative profession under the new arrangements, but a passport to places of
                        eminence in the state; and till the death of Alexander the ranks of the</p>
                   <p>jurists never failed to be recruited by men of position and ability.</p>

                        continued by his successors and was very profitable, thanks to the
                        propensity of the well-to-do classes for single blessedness, followed by
                        testamentary distribution of their fortunes amongst their friends. But it
                        affected only the successions of Roman citizens, so that the great mass of
                        the provincials escaped it. Caracalla, being needy, not only increased it
                        temporarily to 10%, but widened the area, of its operation by elevating all
                        his free subjects to, the rank of citizens. The words of Ulpian regarding
                        the constitution are very inclusive,—” in orbe Romano qui sunt . . .</p>

                        importance. By conferring citizenship on the provincial peregrins it
                        subjected them in their legal relations to the law of Rome, and qualified
                        them for taking part in many transactions both <hi rend="italic">inter

                        clinging as much as possible to the form of republican institutions, thought
                        it expedient not to break with the old practice of submitting legislative
                        proposals to the vote of the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi> of the tribes.
                        Some of the <hi rend="italic">leges</hi> of his reign were far from
                        insignificant. Besides various measures for the amendment of the criminal
                        law, &amp;c., there were three sets of enactments of considerable
                        importance which owed their authorship to him: the first to improve domestic
                        morality and encourage fruitful marriage, the second to abate the evils that
                        had arisen from the too lavish admission of liberated slaves to the
                        privileges of citizenship, and the third to regulate procedure in public
                        prosecutions and private litigations.</p>
                   <p>The first set included the <hi rend="italic">lex Julia de adulteriis et de
                            fundo dotali</hi> of 18 B.c. and the <hi rend="italic">lex Julia et

                        voluminous matrimonial code, in which an earlier <hi rend="italic">lex de

                        an influence as to be regarded as one of the sources of Roman law almost as
                        much as the XII. Tables or Julian’s consolidated Edict. It was often spoken
                        of as the <hi rend="italic">lex Caducaría,</hi> one of its most remarkable
                        provisions being that unmarried persons (within certain ages and under
                        certain qualifications) should forfeit entirely anything to which they were
                        entitled under a testament, and that married but childless persons should
                        similarly forfeit one-half, the lapsed provisions <hi rend="italic"
                            >{caduca)</hi> going to the other persons named in the will who were
                        qualified in terms of the statute, and failing them to the fisc. However
                        well intended, the language of Juvenal and others raises doubts whether the
                        law did not really do more harm than good. By the Christian emperors many of
                        its provisions were repealed as inconsistent with the New Testament views of
                        celibacy, &amp;e., while others fell into, disuse; and in the Justinian
                        books hardly a trace is left of its distinctive features.</p>
                   <p>The second set included the Fufia-Caninian law of the year 2 B.c., the
                        Aelia-Sentian law of the year <hi rend="smallcaps">a.d.</hi> 4, and the

                        possibility of attaining citizenship by a process indicated in the statute,
                        or (3) a freedman who, because of his having undergone certain punishments
                        for grave offences, was forbidden to reside within a hundred miles of Rome
                        and denied the , hope of ever becoming a citizen <hi rend="italic">{libertus

                        precisely the status in the meantime of thosefreedmen who had a potentiality
                        of citizenship. It did so by assimilating them, to a large extent, to the
                        colonial Latins, denying to them the rights of a citizen proper so far as
                        concerned family and succession, but coneeding to them all the patrimonial
                        rights of a citizen and the fullest power of dealing with their belongings
                        so long as not <hi rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> and to the prejudice of
                        their patrons. This was the Junian Latinity so prominent in the plages of
                        Gaius, but of which our limits exclude any detailed description.</p>
                   <p>The third set of enactments referred to included the two <hi rend="italic"
                            >leges Juliae judiciariae,</hi> of which we know but little. They were
                        probably enacted in the year 17 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi> One <hi

                            >judicia publica</hi> and another with procedure in private litigations.
                        Gaius, however, seems to refer to two <hi rend="italic">leges Juliae
                            júdiciorum privatorum,</hi> and it is the opinion of Wlassak, who had
                        studied the subject profoundly, that the second of these was enacted for
                        municipalities outside Rome and was in similar terms to the first. It was
                        these two last-mentioned judiciary statutes that, as Gaius tells us,
                        completed the work of the Aebutian law in substituting the formular system
                        for that</p>

                   <p>of <hi rend="italic">legis actiones.</hi> The one regulating procedure in
                        private suits at Rome must have been a somewhat comprehensive statute, as a
                        passage in the <hi rend="italic">Vatican .Fragments</hi> refers to a
                        provision of its 27th section; and our ignorance of its contents therefore,
                        beyond one or two trifling details, is the more to be regretted. The opinion
                        of Wlassak, already referred to, is that the judiciary laws made procedure
                        by formulae compulsory, while the Aebutian law had left it optional. In all
                        cases remitted to a <hi rend="italic">unus judex qt</hi> other private

                   <p>From the time of Tiberius onwards it was the senate that did the work of
                        legislation, for the simple reason that the <hi rend="italic">comitia</hi>
                        were no longer fit for it. And very active it seems to have been. This may
                        have been due to some extent to the fact that so many professional jurists,
                        aware from their practice of the points in which the law required amendment,
                        possessed seats in the imperial council, where the drafts of the
                        scnatus-consults were prepared. It was the senatusconsults that were the
                        principal statutory factors of what IVas called by both emperors and jurists
                        thejtts <hi rend="italic">novum-</hi> -law that departed often very widely
                        from the principles of the old <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> , that was
                        much more in accordance with tnose of the Edict, and that to a great extent

                        praetors been overshadowed by that of the prince. In the end of the 2nd and
                        the beginning of the 3rd century the supremacy of the latter in the.senate
                        became rather too pronounced, men quoting the <hi rend="italic">or all

                        rarely stood in need of further discussion; but the ignoring of the formal
                        act that followed it tended unduly to emphasize, the share borne in it by
                        the sovereign, and made it all the easier for the emperors after Severus
                        Alexander to dispense</p>
                   <p>altogether with the time-honoured practice.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">The Consolidated Edictum Perpetuum.—</hi> The edicts of
                        the praetors, which had attained very considerable proportions before the
                        fall of the Republic, certainly received some additions in the early Empire.
                        But those magistrates did not long enjoy the same independence as of old;
                        there was a greater <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> than theirs in the
                        state, before which they hesitated to lay hands on the law with the boldness
                        of their predecessors. They continued as before to publish annually at entry
                        on office the edicts that had been handed down to them through generations;
                        but their own additions were soon almost limited to mere amendments rendered
                        necessary by the provisions of some senatusconsult that affected the <hi
                            rend="italic">jus honorarium.</hi> They ceased to be that <hi
                            rend="italic">viva vox juris civilis</hi> which they had been in the
                        time of Cicero; the emperor, if any one, was now entitled to the epithet;
                        the annual edict had lost its <hi rend="italic">raison d'etre.</hi> Hadrian
                        apparently .was of opinion. that the time had come for writing its “
                        explicit,” and giving it another and more enduring and authoritative shape,
                        binding on all future magistrates. He accordingly, it is said, commissioned
                        Salvius Julianus to revise it—or Julian, when urban praetor, may have done
                        so at his own hand with the emperor’s approval—and the senate gave it
                        binding force. It did not, however, become statute law ; the distinction
                        between <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi> and <hi rend="italic">jus
                            praetorium</hi> still continued.</p>
                   <p>The revised Edict unfortunately, like the XII. Tables, is no longer extant.
                        It is only a very slight account we have of the revision—a line or two in
                        Eutropius and Aurelius Victor, and a few lines in two of Justinian’s
                        prefaces to the Digest. We may assume from what is said there that both
                        abridgment and rearrangement, of the edicts of the urban praetor took place,
                        but the question remains how far Julian consolidated with them those of the
                        peregrin praetor and other officials who had contributed to the <hi
                            rend="italic">jus honorarium.</hi> Those of the curule aediles, we are
                        told, were included; Justinian says that they formed the last part of
                        Julian’s work; they formed, in fact, a sort of addendum to it. There is
                        reason to believe that so much of the edicts of the provincial governors as
                        differed from those of the praetors were also incorporated in it,.and that
                        the edicts of the peregrin praetors, in so far as they contained available
                        matter not embodied in those of their urban colleagues or the provincial
                        governors, were dealt with in the same way. <note anchored="true"
                            place="bottom" type="authorial" n="149"> It may be, however, that the
                            edicts of the peregrin praetors and provincial governors were
                            independently codified. See Girard, <hi rend="italic">Manuel

                            identify the <hi rend="italic">edictum provinciale</hi> with that of the
                            peregrin praetor from the time of Augustus is far from convincing and
                            has received no support from other writers. See Kipp. <hi rend="italic"

                        name of <hi rend="italic">Edictum Perpetuum</hi> in a sense somewhat
                        different from that formerly imputed to <hi rend="italic">edicta
                            perpetua</hi> as distinguished from <hi rend="italic">edicta
                            repentina;</hi> it became perpetual in the English sense of the word.
                        Sanctioned by senatusconsult and by the emperor, it became a closed chapter
                        so far as the praetors were concerned; for,. though it continued for a time
                        to hold its place on their album with its formularies of actions, they had
                        no longer any power to alter</p>
                   <p>or even perhaps make additions to it. Having ceased to be a mere efflux of
                        their <hi rend="italic">imperium</hi> and become a type prescribed by
                        statute, its interpretation and amendment w'ere no longer in their hands but
                        in the hands of the emperor.</p>
                   <p>The Julian Edict w'as not divided into parts or books like Justinian’s
                        Digest but only into titles, which w'ere perhaps numbered and certainly were
                        rubricated. Since the publication of Lenel’s great work, noted below, modern
                        Romanists are agreed that the formularies of actions it contained were
                        distributed in their appropriate places throughout the work and not
                        collected together in one place as used to be supposed. Thus a formula based
                        on the civil law <hi rend="italic">(e.g</hi> the <hi rend="italic">rei
                            vindicate)</hi> appeared by itself <hi rend="italic">(i.e.</hi> without
                        any edict) as a separate head or subdivision of the title appropriate to it;
                        while formulae based on the praetor’s <hi rend="italic">imperium (e.g.</hi>
                        that of the praetorian action <hi rend="italic">de dolo)</hi> were placed
                        under their respective edicts. The general arrangement of the subject-matter
                        is not. difficult to discover, as we have documentary evidence to a certain
                        extent in writings which have come down to us. These are principally (1) the
                        Digest .of Justinian, in the prefaces to w'hich we are told expressly that
                        it followed the order of the Edict except in certain places specially
                        noticed; (2) the Code of Justinian; (3) the extracts from, divers
                        commentaries on the Edict by the classical jurists principally preserved in
                        the Digest. As the inscriptions of these extracts contain tht name of the
                        author, the work and the {»articular book from which they are taken, they
                        have proved of great help towards understanding the arrangement—especially
                        the commentaries of Ulpian and Paul on the urban edict and the commentary of
                        Gaius on the provincial edict. Lenel has showm that Julian’s plan, of
                        arrangement was neither logical nor symmetrical, but adhered in great
                        measure to the old order (tralatitious) of the urban praetors. The following
                        fourfold division of the subject-matter.is, according to Lenel (partially
                        following Rudorff), clearly ascertainable: first, a series of titles.dealing
                        with the preliminary steps in all actions such as jurisdiction, summons,
                        intervention of procurators and the like; second, titles dealing mainly with
                        matters of ordinary procedure or rather with actions granted principally in
                        accordance with statute <hi rend="italic">(judicia légitima)</hi> as <hi
                            rend="italic">petitio hereditatis, rei vindicatio,</hi> &amp;c. ;
                        third, titles dealing with actions resting principally on the. magistrate’s
                            <hi rend="italic">imperium (judicia imperio continentia)</hi> ; fourth,
                        execution of judgments, including bankruptcy., &amp;c. These four parts
                        were followed by a kind of appendix containing in three titles the separate
                        styles of interdicts, exceptions and praetorian stipulations. Finally, the
                        edicts of the curule aediles, with their formulae also consolidated, were
                        added at the end of the work. From the fragments of the jurists preserved by
                        Justinian (principally from the three above-mentioned commentaries, but also
                        to an important extent from. Julian himself in his <hi rend="italic"
                            >Digesta)</hi> repeated attempts have been made in modern times to
                        reproduce the Edict in its entirety. Most of these are mere transcripts with
                        attempted reconstructions of passages in Justinian’s Digest and of little
                        value. The only really scientific and worthy critical efforts are those of
                        Rudorff in 1869 and, above all, of Lenel in 1883. <note anchored="true"

                        his successors down to about the time of Severus Alexander, did not imply
                        any curtailment of the right of unlicensed jurists to give advice to any one
                        who chose.to consult them.</p>
                   <p>YVhat it did was to give an authoritative character to a response, so that
                        the judge who had asked for it and to whom it was presented—Tor the judges
                        were but private citizens, most of them unlearned in the law—was practically
                        bound to adopt it as if it had emanated from the emperor himself. It may hie
                        that Augustus was actuated by a political motive—that he was desirous by
                        this concession to attach lawyers of eminence to the newregime, and prevent
                        the recurrence of the evils experienced during the Republic from the too
                        great influence of patrons. But, whatever may have prompted his action in
                        the matter, its beneficial consequences for the law.can hardly be overrated.
                        For the powers with which they were invested enabled the patented counsel to
                        influence current doctrine not speculatively merely but positively <hi

                        to give a new complexion to the system.</p>
                   <p>Instead of giving his opinion like the unlicensed jurist by word of mouth,
                        either at the request of the judge or at the instance of one of the parties,

                        Augustus docs not seem to have contemplated the possibility of conflicting
                        responses being tendered from two or more jurists equally privileged. It was
                        an awkward predicament for a judge to be placed in. Hadrian solved the
                        difficulty by declaring that in such a case the judge should be entitled to
                        use his own discretion. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        that the number of patented responding counsel was very limited; that a
                        judge, if he desired their assistance, was required by this rescript to

                        constitution, whether in the shape of rescript, decree or edict, had the
                        force of statute. It may be that by the time of Ulpian that was the
                        prevailing opinion; but modern criticism is disposed to regard the dictum of
                        Gaius, written in the time of Antoninus Pius, as coloured by his Asiatic
                        notions, and not quite accurate so far at least as the edicts were
                        concerned. Apart from executive laws <hi rend="italic">(leges datae),</hi>
                        the early imperial edicts were theoretically rather part of the <hi
                            rend="italic">jus honorarium.</hi> As supreme magistrate the emperor had
                        the same <hi rend="italic">jus edicendi</hi> that consuls and praetors had
                        had before him, and used it as they did to indicate some course of action he
                        meant to adopt and follow or some relief he proposed to grant. His edicts
                        were as a rule drawn up in writing in the imperial council and publicly
                        notified in all parts of the Empire. His range, of course in respect of his
                            <hi rend="italic">imperium,</hi> was much greater than that of the
                        praetors had been; for his authority endured for life, and extended over the
                        whole Empire and every department of government. But in principle, .it is
                        thought, his successor on the throne was no more bound to adopt any ofhis
                        edicts than a praetor was to adopt those of his predecessors. That it was
                        not unusual for an edict to be renewed, and that it occasionally happened
                        that the renewal was not by the immediate successor of its original author,
                        are manifest from various passages in the texts. Sometimes, when its utility
                        had stood the test of years, it was transmuted into a senatus-consult; this
                        fact proves of itself that an edict <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> had not
                        the effect of statute. But their adoption by a succession of two or three
                        sovereigns, whose reigns were of average duration, may have been held
                        sufficient to give them the character of consuetudinary law; and, by a not
                        unnatural process, unreflecting public opinion may have come to impute force
                        of statute to the edict itself rather than to the <hi rend="italic">longa
                            consuetudo</hi> that followed on it, thus paving the way for the
                        assertion.by the sovereigns of the later Empire of an absolute right of
                        legislation, and for the recognition of the <hi rend="italic">lex</hi>
                   </p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">edictalis</hi> as the only form of statute.</p>
                   <p>The imperial rescripts and decrees <hi rend="italic">(rescripta,
                            decreta)</hi> apparently acquired force of law <hi rend="italic">(legis
                            vicem obtinent)</hi> pretty early in the Empire, and their operation was
                        not theoretically limited to the lifetime of the prince from whom they had
                        proceeded. But they were not directly acts of legislation. In both the
                        emperor theoretically did no more than authoritatively interpret existing
                        law, although the boundary between interpretation and new law, sometimes
                        difficult to define, was not always closely adhered to. Thus the <hi
                            rend="italic">decretum Mar ci,</hi> penalizing procedure by self-help,
                        and the <hi rend="italic">epistula Hadriani,</hi> introducing the <hi
                            rend="italic">beneficium divtsionts</hi> among co-sureties, are notable
                        instances of authoritative interpretation. The rescript was strictly a
                        written answer by the emperor to a petition, either by an official or a
                        private party, for an instruction as to how the law was to be applied in any
                        particular case to the facts set forth; when the answer was in a separate
                        writing it was usually spoken of as an <hi rend="italic">tpistula*,</hi>
                        when noted at the foot of the application its technical name was <hi
                            rend="italic">subscriptio.</hi> But sometimes also general orders of the
                        smperors addressed to some official and intended for a province or
                        particular community were classed under the head of rescripts. The decree
                        was the emperor's ruling, orally announced, in a case submitted to him
                        judicially; it might be when it had been brought before him in the first
                        instance <hi rend="italic">extra ordinem,</hi> or when it had been removed
                        by <hi rend="italic">supplicatio</hi> from an inferior court in its earliest
                        stage, ?r when it came before him by appeal. Such decrees were duly</p>
                   <p>recorded and kept <hi rend="italic">apud acta.</hi> It was theoretically as
                        a judge that the emperor pronounced his decree, though in practice he
                        sometimes went beyond the case in hand, evolving new doctrines. Proceeding
                        as it did from the iountain of authoritative interpretation, the decree had
                        a value far beyond that of the sentence of an inferior court (which was law
                        only as between the parties), and formed a precedent which governed all
                        future cases involving the same question. Those rescripts and decrees
                        constituted one of the most important sources of the law during the first
                        three centuries of the Empire, and were elaborated with the assistance of
                        the most eminent jurists of the day, the rescripts being the special charge
                        of the <hi rend="italic">magister libellorum.</hi> From the time of the
                        Gordians to that of the abdication of Diocletian they were almost the only
                        channel of the <hi rend="italic">jus scriptum</hi> that remained.</p>
                   <p>A fourth class of imperial constitutions were the so-called <hi
                            rend="italic">mandata.</hi> These, however, were mainly of the nature of
                        instructions by the emperors to individual imperial officials, similar to
                        edicts, ana dealt with public law for the most part.</p>

                        the period with which we are dealing saw the substantial disappearance of
                        the distinction between citizen and peregrin, it witnessed the expansion of
                        another—that between soldiers and civilians <hi rend="italic">(milites,
                            pagan!).</hi> The most remarkable effluxes of the <hi rend="italic">jus
                            militare</hi> (as it is sometimes called) were the military testament
                        and the <hi rend="italic">castrense peculium.</hi> The first was practically
                        exempted from all the rules of the <hi rend="italic">jits civile</hi> and
                        the praetors’ edict alike as to the form and substance of last wills. It
                        might be in writing, by word of mouth, by the unspoken signs perhaps of a
                        dying man; all that was required was the <hi rend="italic">voluntas</hi> so
                        manifested as not to be mistaken. More extraordinary still—it was sustained
                        even though its provisions ran counter to the most cherished rules of the
                        common law. Contrary to the maxim that no man could dispense with the
                        institution of an heir or die partly testate and partly intestate, a soldier
                        might dispose of part of his estate by testament with or without nomination
                        of an heir,.and leave the rest to descend to his heirs <hi rend="italic">ab
                            intestato.</hi> Contrary also to the maxim <hi rend="italic">semel heres
                            semper heres,</hi> he might give his estate to A. for life or for a term
                        of years, or until the occurrence of some event, with remainder to B.
                        Contrary to the general rule, a Latin or peregrin, or an unmarried or
                        married but childless person, might take an inheritance or a bequest from a
                        soldier as freely as could a citizen with children. His testament, in so far
                        as it disposed only of <hi rend="italic">bona castrensia,</hi> was not
                        affected by <hi rend="italic">capitis deminutio minima.</hi> It was not
                        invalidated by praeterition of $2« <hi rend="italic">heredes,</hi> nor could
                        they challenge it because they had less under it than their “legitim”; nor
                        could the instituted heir claim a Falcidian fourth, even though nine-tenths
                        of the succession had been assigned to legatees. Finally, a later testament
                        did not nullify an earlier one, if it appeared to be the intention of the
                        soldier testator that they should be read together.</p>

                   <p>All this is remarkable, manifesting a spirit very different from that which
                        animated the common law of testaments. True, it was a principle with the
                        jurists of the classical period that the <hi rend="italic">voluntatis
                            ratio</hi> was to be given effect to in the interpretation of
                        testamentary writings; but that was on the condition that the requirements
                        of law as to form and substance had been scrupulously observed. But in the
                        military testament positive rules were made to yield to the <hi
                            rend="italic">voluntas</hi> in all respects: the will was almost
                        absolutely unfettered. Roman law in this matter gave place to natural law.
                        One would have expected the influence of so great a change to have
                        manifested itself by degrees in the ordinary law of testaments; yet it is
                        barely visible. In a few points the legislation of Constantine, Theodosius
                        II. and Justinian relaxed the strictness of the old rules; but there was
                        never any approach to the recognition of the complete supremacy of the <hi
                            rend="italic">voluntas.</hi> In the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi>
                        the contrast between the <hi rend="italic">testamentum paganum</hi> and the
                            <hi rend="italic">testamentum militare</hi> was almost as marked as in
                        the days of Trajan. The latter was still a privileged deed, whose use was
                        confined to a soldier actually on service, and if he received an honourable
                        discharge, for twelve months after his retirement.</p>
                   <p>The <hi rend="italic">peculium castrense</hi> had a wider influence; for it
                        was the first of a series of amendments that vastly diminished the
                        importance of the <hi rend="italic">patria potestas</hi> on its patrimonial
                        side. It had its origin in a constitution of Augustus granting to <hi
                            rend="italic">filiifamilias</hi> on service the right to dispose by
                        testament of what they had acquired in the active exercise of their
                        profession <hi rend="italic">{quod in castris adquisterant).</hi>

                        <hi rend="italic"/> But it soon went much further. Confined at first to <hi
                            rend="italic">filiifamilias</hi> on actual service, the privilege was
                        extended by Hadrian to those who had obtained honourable discharge. The same
                        emperor allowed them not merely to test on their <hi rend="italic">peculium
                            castrense,</hi> but to manumit <hi rend="italic">inter vivos</hi> slaves
                        that formed part of it; and by a little step further the classical jurists
                        recognized their right to dispose of it onerously or gratuitously <hi
                            rend="italic">inter vtvos.</hi> In the 3rd century the range of it was
                        extended so as to include not only the soldier’s pay and prize, but all that
                        had come to him, directly or indirectly, in connexion with his
                        profession—his outfit, gifts made to him during his service, legacies from
                        comrades and so on. All this was in a high degree subversive of the
                        doctrines of the common law. It may almost be called revolutionary; for it
                        involved in the first place the recognition of the right of. a person <hi
                            rend="italic">alieni juris</hi> to make a testament as if he were <hi
                            rend="italic">sui juris,</hi> and in the second place the recognition of
                        a separate estate in a <hi rend="italic">filiusfami-lias</hi> which he might
                        deal with independently of his <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias,</hi> which
                        could not be touched by the latter’s creditors, and which he was not even
                        bound to collate (or bring into hotch-pot) on claiming a share of his

                        still in law required no more for its creation than deliberate interchange
                        of nuptial consent, although in.certain cases some act indicative of change
                        of life, such as the bride’s home-coming to her husband’s house, was

                        his time, it was almost unknown by the end of the period. Husband and wife
                        therefore had their separate estates, the common establishment being
                        maintained by the husband, with the assistance of the revenue of the wife's

                            >repudium</hi> by either spouse) was unfortunately very common; it was
                        lawful even without any assignable cause; when blame attached to either

                   <p>Not only in the case of a <hi rend="italic">filiusfamilias</hi> who had
                        adopted a military career, but in all directions, there was manifested a

                        the hold that the principles of natural law were gaining within the Roman

                   <p>to the-fact that the emperors, having succeeded to the censorial <hi

                        influence their edicts and rescripts. Exposure of an infant was still
                        apparently allowed; but a parent was no longer permitted, even in the
                        character of household judge, to put his son to death or cruelly ill-treat
                        him; in fact his prerogative was limited to moderate chastisement, the
                        law.requiring, in the case of a grave offence that merited severer
                        punishment, that he should bring his child before the comi&gt;etent
                        magistrate. His right of sale, in like manner, was permitted only when.he

                        had been a <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias,</hi> with one exception, namely,
                        when his debt was for borrowed money; in that case, with some very
                        reasonable qualifications, it was declared by the well-known Macedonian
                        scnatusconsult (of the time of Vespasian) that.the lender should not be
                        entitled to recover payment, even after his borrower had become <hi

                        contract; but so was there now between a father and his soldier son in any
                        matter relating to the <hi rend="italic">peculium castrense,</hi> even
                        though the son was <hi rend="italic">in potestate.</hi> What is still more
                        remarkable is that, the new sentiment which was operating on the <hi

                        regulation by the jurists, whose exposition indeed of the law of
                        guardianship generally, whether by tutors or curators, has found wide
                        acceptance in modern systems of jurisprudence.</p>

                        and <hi rend="italic">nuncupatio testamenti.</hi> It was his rescript,
                        formerly mentioned, declaring that an heir-at-law should no longer be

                        non-compliance with the purely formal requirements of the law, that
                        practically established what Justinian calls the praetorian testament.</p>
                   <p>One of the commonest provisions in the testaments of the period was the <hi

                        in favour of a third party. It was introduced in the time, of Augustus by
                        (it is said by Thcophilus) a testator who had married a peregrin wife, and
                        desired thus indirectly to give to his peregrin children the succession
                        which, as not being citizens, they could neither take <hi rend="italic">ab

                        approval of the new institution by remitting the matter to the consuls of
                        the day, with instructions to do in the circumstances what they thought
                        just. So quickly did it establish itself in public favour, and so numerous
                        did the questions become as to the construction and fulfilment of
                        testamentary trusts, that under Claudius it was found necessary to institute
                        a court specially charged with their adjudication—that of the <hi

                   </p>
                   <p>The employment of a trust as a. means of benefiting those who were under
                        disqualifications as heirs or legatees, as, for example, persons who had no

                        statute; but that did not affect its general popularity. For, whether what
                        was contemplated was a transfer of the universal <hi rend="italic"
                            >hereditas</hi> or an aliquot part of it to the beneficiary <hi

                        particular thing <hi rend="italic">(fideicommissum rei singularis),</hi> a
                        testamentary trust had various advantages over either a direct institution
                        or a direct bequest <hi rend="italic">(legatum).</hi> Still the imposition
                        upon the heir of a trust in favour of a beneficiary, whether it required
                        him. to denude of .the whole or only a part of the inheritance, did not in
                        theory deprive him of his character of heir or relieve him of the
                        responsibilities of the position; and at common law therefore he was
                        entitled to decline the succession, often to the great prejudice of the
                        beneficiary. In order to avoid such a mischance, ana at the same time to
                        regulate their relations <hi rend="italic">inter se</hi> and towards
                        debtors.and creditors of the testator, it became the practice for the
                        parties to enter into stipulatory arrangements about the matter; but these
                        were to some extent rendered superfluous by two se.natusconsults, the
                        Trebellian in the time of Nero and the Pegasian in that of Vespasian, which
                        not only secured the beneficiary against the trustee’s (i.e. the heir’s)
                        repudiation of the inheritance, but also protected the latter from all risk
                        of loss where he was trustee ana nothing more, and enabled the former to
                        treat directly with debtors and creditors.of the testator and himself
                        ingather the corporeal items of the inheritance.</p>
                   <p>It was one of the advantages of a trust-bequest, whether universal or
                        singular, that it might be conferred in a codicil, even though unconfirmed
                        by any relative testament. The codicil <hi rend="italic">(codicilli),</hi>
                        also ^n invention of the time of Augustus, was a deed of a very simple
                        nature. Though in the later Empire it required to be formally attested by at
                        least five witnesses, it was at first quite informal. It was inappropriate
                        either for disherison of <hi rend="italic">sui</hi> or institution of an
                        heir; but if confirmed by testament, either prior or posterior to its date,
                        it might contain direct bequests, manumissions, nominations of tutors, and
                        the like, and whether confirmed or unconfirmed might, as stated, be utilized
                        as a vehicle for trust-gifts. Latterly it was held operative, even in the
                        absence of a testament, the trusts contained in it being regarded as burdens
                        on the heir-at-law.</p>
                   <p>The most important changes in the law of intestate succession during the
                        period were those accomplished by the Tertullian and Orphitian
                        senatusconsults, fruits of.that respect for the precepts of natural law
                        which in so many directions was modifying the doctrines of the <hi
                            rend="italic">jus civile.</hi> The first was passed in the reign of
                        Hadrian, the second in the year 178, under Marcus Aurelius. Down to the time
                        of the Tertullian senatusconsult a mother and her child by a marriage that
                        was unaccompanied with <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> stood related to each
                        other only as cognates, being in law members of different families;
                        consequently their chance of succession to each other was remote, being
                        postponed to that of their respective agnates. The purpose of the
                        senatusconsult was to prefer a mother to all agnates of her deceased child
                        except father and brother and sister; father and brother excluded her; but
                        with a sister of the deceased, and in the absence of father or brother, she
                        shared equally. While there can be little doubt that it was considerations
                        of natural law that.dictated this amendment, yet its authors were too timid
                        to justify it on the abstract principle of common humanity, and so they
                        confined its application to women who had the <hi rend="italic">jus
                            liberorum, i.e.</hi> to women of free birth who were mothers of three
                        children and freedwomen who were mothers of four, thus making it ostensibly
                        a reward of fertility. The Orphitian senatusconsult was the counterpart of
                        the Tertullian. It gave children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, a
                        right of succession to their.mother in preference to all her agnates; and
                        subsequent constitutions extended the principle, admitting lawful children
                        to the inheritance not only of their maternal grandparents but also to that
                        of their paternal grandmother.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic"/> The ordinary procedure during the greater part of the
                        first three centuries of the Empire was still two-staged; it commenced
                        before the praetor <hi rend="italic">(in jure)</hi> and was concluded before
                        a judge or judges <hi rend="italic">(in judicio).</hi> But the <hi
                            rend="italic">legis actiones</hi> had with a few exceptions given place
                        to praetorian formulae. Under the sacramental system parties,</p>
                   <p>and particularly the plaintiff, had themselves to formulate in statutory or
                        traditional words of style the matter in controversy between them; and as
                        they formulated, so did it go for trial to centumviral court or <hi
                            rend="italic">judex,</hi> with the not infrequent result that it was
                        then all too late discovered that the real point in the case had been
                        missed. Under the formular system parties were free to represent their
                        plaint and defence to the praetor in any words they pleased, the plaintiff
                        asking for a formula and usually indicating the style on the <hi
                            rend="italic">album</hi> that he thought would suit his purpose, and the
                        defendant demanding when necessary an exception, t.c. a plea in defence,
                        either praetorian or statutory, that, without traversing the facts or law of
                        the plaintiff’s case, avoided his demand on grounds of equity or public
                        policy or the like. It was for the praetor to consider and determine whether
                        the action or exception should or should not be granted, and, if granted,
                        whether it should be according to the style exhibited on the <hi
                            rend="italic">cdbum</hi> or according to a mixlification of it. The
                        result he embodied in a written and signed appointment of a j udge, whom he
                        instructed what he had to try, and empowered to pronounce a finding either
                        condemning or acquitting the defendant. This writing was the formula.</p>
                   <p>Although it was not until the early Empire that this system of civil
                        procedure attained its full development, yet it had l/egun between one and
                        two centuries before the fall of the Republic. Gaius ascribes its
                        introduction and definitive establishment to the <hi rend="italic">lex
                            Aebutia</hi> and two judiciary laws of the time of Augustus, formerly
                        mentioned <hi rend="italic">(supra,</hi> pp. 98, 124). The Aebutian law, of
                        which unfortunately we know very little,, is generally supposed to have
                        empowered the praetors (1) to devise a simpler form of procedure for causes
                        already cognizable <hi rend="italic">per legis actionem,</hi> (2) to devise
                        forms of action to meet cases not cognizable undertheoldcr system, and (3)
                        themselves to formulate the issue and reduce it to writing. It was by no
                        means so radical a change as is sometimes supposed. There were formulae
                        employed by the peregrin praetor before it and also perhaps something
                        analogous thereto by the urban praetor. There were also formulae of a kind
                        employed both in the procedure <hi rend="italic">per judicis
                            postulationem</hi> and in that <hi rend="italic">per condictionem.</hi>
                        The difference between the latter and the <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi> of
                        the Aebutian system was that they were in part mere echoes of the statutory
                        words of style uttered by the plaintiff, and that they were not written but
                        spoken in the hearing of witnesses.</p>
                   <p>A large proportion of the personal actions of the formular system were
                        evolved out of the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per condictionem.</hi> The
                        sequence of operations may have been something like this. Taking the
                        simplest form of it, the action for <hi rend="italic">certa pecunia</hi>
                        under the Silian law, the first step was to drop the formal <hi
                            rend="italic">condictio</hi> from which it derived its character of <hi
                            rend="italic">legis actio,</hi> thus avoiding a delay of thirty days;
                        the plaintiff stated his demand in informal words, and, if the defendant
                        denied indebtedness, the praetor straightway formulated a written
                        appointment of and instruction to a judge, embodying in it the issue in
                        terms substantially the same as those he would have employed under the
                        earlier procedure:—“Titius be judge. Should it appear that N. N. ought to
                        pay <hi rend="italic">(dare oportere)</hi> 50,000 sesterces to A. A., in
                        that sum condemn N.N. to A.A.; <note anchored="true" place="bottom"
                            type="authorial" n="163"> In the typical Roman styles of actions the
                            plaintiff was usually called Aulus Agerius and the defendant Numerius
                            Negidius. </note> should it so not appear, acquit him.” This was no
                        longer the <hi rend="italic">legis actio per condictionem,</hi> because what
                        had made it <hi rend="italic">legis actio</hi> was gone, but the <hi
                            rend="italic">condictio certae pecuniae</hi> of the formular system. The
                            <hi rend="italic">condictio triticaria</hi> of the same system ran on
                        the same lines: “ Titius be judge.. Should it appear that N. N. ought to
                        give A. A. the slave Stichus, then, whatever be the value of the slave, in
                        that condemn N. N. to A. A.,” and so on. In each of these examples the
                        formula included only two of the four principal clauses that might find
                        place in it <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="164">
                            Gaius enumerates them as <hi rend="italic">demonstratio, intentio,
                                adjudicatio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">condemnatio,</hi> and
                            describes their several functions in iv. §§ 39-43. The <hi rend="italic"
                                >intentio</hi> and <hi rend="italic">condemnatio</hi> were much the
                            most important, the others being employed only in certain kinds of
                            actions. Besides, these a <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> might be
                            preceded by a <hi rend="italic">praescriptio</hi> (Gai. iv. §§ 130-137),
                            and have incorporated in it fictions (§§ 32-38). exceptions (§§

                        an “ intention ” and a “ condemnation.” The matter of claim in both cases
                        was certain,—so much money in one, a slave in the other; but, while in the
                        first the condemnation, also was certain, in the second it w’as uncertain.
                        What if the.claim also was uncertain,—say a share of the profits of a joint
                        adventure assured by stipulation ? It was perhaps competent for the
                        plaintiff to specify a definite sum, and claim that as due to him; but it
                        was very hazardous, for unless he was able to prove the debt to the last
                        sesterce he lost his case. To obviate the risk of such failure the praetors
                        devised the <hi rend="italic">actio ex stipulate,</hi> whose formula
                        commenced with a “demonstration ” or indication of the cause of action, and
                        w'hose “ intention ” referred to it and was conceived indefinitely: “ Titius
                        be judge. Whereas A. A. stipulated with N. N. for a share of the profits of

                        Once this point was attained further progress was comparatively easy, the
                        way being open for the construction of formulae upon illiquid claims arising
                        from transactions in which the practice of stipulation gradually dropped out
                        of use, till at last the <hi rend="italic">bonae fidei indicia</hi> were
                        reached, marked by the presence in the “ intention <hi rend="sup">T</hi> '
                        of the words <hi rend="italic">ex fide bona—</hi> “ whatever in respect
                        thereof N. N. ought in good faith to give to or do for A. A.”</p>
                   <p>In the case of real actions the transition from the <hi rend="italic">legis
                            aetiones</hi> to the formulae followed a different course. The Aebutian
                        law, while sanctioning the competency of formulae, did not interfere with
                        the procedure <hi rend="italic">per sacramentum</hi> when reference was to
                        be to the centumviral court on a question of quintarían right. In the time
                        of Cicero that court was apparently still in full activity <hi rend="italic"
                            >(supra),</hi> but by that</p>
                   <p>of Gaius, owing, it is supposed, to the Julian laws having made formulae in
                        most cases compulsory, it was rarely resorted to except for trial of
                        questions of inheritance. In his time questions of property were raised
                        either <hi rend="italic">per sponsionem</hi> or <hi rend="italic">per
                            fortnulam peti-toriam.</hi> The procedure by sponsion may be regarded as
                        a sort of bridge between the sacramental process and the petitory <hi
                            rend="italic">vindi* catio.</hi> In it the question of real right was
                        determined only indirectly. The plaintiff required the defendant to give him
                        his stipulatory promise to pay. a nominal sum of twenty-five sesterces in
                        the event of the thing in dispute being found to belong to the former; and
                        at the.same time the defendant gave sureties for its transfer to the
                        plaintiff, with all fruits and profits, in the same event. The formula that
                        was adjusted and remitted to a judge raised <hi rend="italic">ex facie</hi>
                        only the simple question whether the twenty-five sesterces were due or not:
                        the action was in form a personal, not a real one, and was therefore
                        appropriately remitted to a single <hi rend="italic">judex</hi> instead of
                        to the centumviral tribunal. But judgment on it could be reached only
                        through means of a finding <hi rend="italic">(sententia)</hi> on the
                        question of real right; if it was for the plaintiff, he did not claim the
                        amount of the sponsion, but the thing which had been found to be his; and,
                        if the defendant delayed to deliver it, with its fruits and profits, the
                        plaintiff had recourse against the latter’s sureties. The petitory formula,
                        was undoubtedly of later introduction and much more straightforward. Like
                        the <hi rend="italic">condictio certae pecuniae,</hi> it contained only
                        “intention” and “condemnation/It ran thus: “ Titius be judge. Should it
                        appear that the slave Stichus, about whom this action has been raised,
                        belongs to A. A. in quiritary right, then, unless the slave be restored,
                        whatever be his value, in that you will condemn N. N. to A. A.; should it
                        not so appear, you will acquit him.”</p>
                   <p>The formulae given above, whether applicable to real or personal actions,
                        are so many illustrations of tne class known as <hi rend="italic">formulae

                        characteristic of such a formula was that it contained in the “ intention ”

                        Where a direct action was inapplicable to pdrticular cases or persons,
                        according to the terms of a <hi rend="italic">lex,</hi> edict, &amp;c.,
                        the praetor frequently adapted the statute, &amp;c., to such cases and
                        persons by granting an <hi rend="italic">actio utilis.</hi> He did so where
                        he thought them to be within the spirit though not the letter of the law. He
                        effected his object, commonly by a modification of the regular formula
                        either objectively, as by adding, or omitting, or altering words, or
                        subjectively by transposing names of parties. But sometimes also the
                        adaptation was maae by the introduction of a legal fiction into the regular
                        formula, and in this case the action was called <hi rend="italic">utilis
                            fictitia</hi> or simply <hi rend="italic">fictitia.</hi> The <hi
                            rend="italic">aetiones utiles</hi> might, therefore, be of two kinds,
                        ordinary and fictitious. Those of common occurrence early became stereotyped
                        in the Edict and even got special names.</p>
                   <p>As illustrations of .an ordinary <hi rend="italic">actio utilis,</hi> in
                        which the formula was objectively modified, reference may be made to the
                        numerous actions for wrongful damage to property under the <hi rend="italic"
                            >lex Aquilia.</hi> Thus this statute in its first chapter used the term
                            <hi rend="italic">oceidere,</hi> which means killing by a physical act
                        of violence <hi rend="italic">(corpore corpori),</hi> but to meet cases of
                        Killing without violence (c.g. by poison) the praetors simply substituted
                        the words <hi rend="italic">mortis causam praestare</hi> for <hi
                            rend="italic">oceidere</hi> in the formula. As illustrations of an
                        ordinary <hi rend="italic">actio utilis</hi> with subjective transposition
                        of names, we may mention the <hi rend="italic">actio Rutiliana</hi>
                        applicable to a purchaser of the bankrupt estate of a living debtor, the
                        action by an assignee of a debt against the debtor, and the action of a
                        procurator suing for his principal. In these the names of. the bankrupt,
                        cedent and principal respectively appeared in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >intentio,</hi> while the plaintiff’s name was inserted in the <hi

                   <p>Resort to a fiction is sometimes said to be a confession of weakness, and
                        adversely criticized accordingly. But every amendment on the law is an.
                        admission of defect in w hat is being amended; and it was in sympathy with
                        the spirit of Roman jurisprudence, when it found an action too narrow Jn its
                        definition, to include some new case that ought to fall within it, rather by
                        feigning that the new case was the same as the old, to bring it within the
                        scope of the existing and familiar action, than to cause disturbance by.
                        either altering the definition of the latter or introducing an entirely new
                        remedy. A <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessor</hi> held a position unknown
                        to the <hi rend="italic">jus civile*,</hi> he was not an heir, and therefore
                        not entitled offhand to employ the actions competent to an heir, either for
                        recovering the property of the defunct or proceeding against his debtors.
                        The praetor could have had no difficulty in devising new actions to meet his
                        case; but he preferred the simpler expedient of adapting to it an heir’s
                        actions, by introducing into the formula a fiction of civil heirship; so he
                        did with the <hi rend="italic">bonorum emptor</hi> or purchaser of a
                        deceased bankrupt’s estate at the sale of it in mass by his creditors. A
                        peregrin could not sue or be sued for the penalties imposed for theft or
                        culpable damage to property, for the XII. Tables and the Aquilian law
                        applied only to citizens; but he could both sue and be sued under cover of a
                        fiction of citizenship. A man who had acquired a <hi rend="italic">res
                            mancipi</hi> on a good title, but without taking a conveyance by
                        mancipation or surrender in court, if he was dispossessed before he had
                        completed his usucapion, could not sue a <hi rend="italic">rci
                            vindicatio</hi> for its. recovery, for he was not in a position to
                        affirm that he was quiritarian owner; neither, for the same reason, could a
                        man who in good faith and on a sufficient title had acquired a thing from
                        one who was not in a position to alienate it. But in both cases the praetor
                        granted him w hat was in effect a <hi rend="italic">rei vindicatio</hi>
                        proceeding on a fiction of completed usucapion—the Publician .action
                        referred to on p. 556. These are examples of <hi rend="italic">aetiones

                        by this very simple expedient to cases, to which otherwise they would have
                        been inapplicable, and forming one of the most important varieties of the

                        however, it became the practice in certain cases to abstain from adjusting a

                        as an administrative official. Such cases did not necessarily come before
                        the ordinary judicial praetors; on the contrary, they were committed as a
                        rule to special officials <hi rend="italic">(e.g.</hi> consuls) who were
                        appointed to decide them by the emperors. This kind of procedure was adopted
                        sometimes because the claim that was being made rested rather on moral than
                        on legal right, and sometimes in order to avoid unnecessary disclosure of
                        family misunderstandings. Thus, the earliest questions that were raised
                        about testamcntaiy trusts were sent for consideration and disposal to the
                        consuls, apparently because, in the existing state of jurisprudence, it was
                        thought incompetent for a beneficiary to maintain in reference to the heir
                        (who had only been <hi rend="italic">requested</hi> to comply with the
                        testator’s wishes) that he was bound in law to pay him (¿are <hi
                            rend="italic">oportere)</hi> his bequest. Had the difficulty arisen at
                        an earlier period, and in the heyday of the constructive energy of the
                        praetors, they would probably have solved it with an <hi rend="italic">actio
                            in factum.</hi> As it was, it fell to the emperors to deal with it, and
                        they adopted the method of <hi rend="italic">extraordinaria cognitio,</hi>
                        the jurisdiction which they in the first instance conferred on the consuls
                        being before long confided to a magistrate specially designated for it.,—the
                            <hi rend="italic">praetor fidei commissarius.</hi> Questions between
                        tutors and their pupil wards in like manner began to be dealt with <hi
                            rend="italic">extra ordinem,</hi> the cognition being entrusted by
                        Marcus Aurelius to a <hi rend="italic">praetor tutelaris;</hi> while fiscal
                        questions in which a private party was interested went to a <hi
                            rend="italic">praetor fisci,</hi> whose creation was due to Nerva.
                        Claims for aliment between parent and child or patron and freedman rested on
                        natural duty rather than on legal right; they could not therefore well be
                        made the subject-matter of a <hi rend="italic">judicium,</hi> and
                        consequently went for disposal to the consuls or the city prefect, and in
                        the provinces to tne governor. Questions of status, especially of freedom or
                        slavery, at least from the time of Marcus Aurelius, were also disposed of
                            <hi rend="italic">extra ordinem;</hi> and so. were claims by physicians,
                        advocates and public teachers for their <hi rend="italic">honoraria,</hi>
                        and by officials for their salaries, the Romans refusing to admit that these
                        could be recovered by an ordinary action of location. In all those
                        extraordinary cognitions the procedure began with a complaint addressed to
                        the magistrate, instead of an <hi rend="italic">in jus vocatiooi</hi> the
                        party complained against; it was for the magistrate to require the
                        attendance of the latter <hi rend="italic">(evocatio)</hi> if he thought the
                        complaint relevant. The decision was a <hi rend="italic">judicatum</hi> or</p>

                        increased under that of the <hi rend="italic">jus praetorium.</hi> The
                        characteristic of the developed procedure by interdict was this—that in it
                        the praetor reversed the ordinary course of things, and, instead of waiting
                        for an inquiry into the facts alleged by a complainer, provisionally assumed
                        them to be true and pronounced an order upon the respondent, which he was
                        bound either to obey or show to be unjustified. The order pronounced might
                        be either rcstitutory, exhibitory (in both cases usually spoken of in the
                        texts as a <hi rend="italic">decretum),</hi> or prohibitory:—rcstitutory,
                        when, for example, the respondent was. ordained to restore something he was
                        alleged to have taken possession of by violent means, to remove impediments
                        he had placed in the channel of a river, and the like; exhibitory, when he
                        was ordained to produce something he was unwarrantably detaining, <hi
                            rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the body of a freeman he was holding as his
                        slave, or a will in which the complainer alleged that he had an interest;
                        prohibitory, as, for example, that he should not disturb the <hi
                            rend="italic">status quo</hi> of possession as between the complainer
                        and himself, that he should not interfere with a highway, a watercourse, the
                        access to a sepulchre, and so forth. If the respondent obeyed the order
                        pronounced in a restitutory or exhibitory decree, there was an end of the
                        matter. But frequently, and perhaps more often than not, the interdict was
                        only the commencement, of a litigation, facilitated by sponsions and
                        restipula.tions,.in which the questions had to be tried (1) whether <hi
                            rend="sup">-</hi> the interdict or injunction was justified, (2) whether
                        there had been breach of it, and, (3) if so, what damages were due in
                        consequence. The procedure therefore was often anything but summary.. .</p>

                        to both parties. Gaius says, but, as most modern writers think, erroneously,
                        that they had been devised as ancillary to a litigation about ownership, and
                        for the purpose of deciding which of the parties, as possessor, was to have

                        to which they led up. Take the interdict <hi rend="italic">uti

                            >utrubi</hi> did to movables. Both parties being present, the praetor
                        addressed them to this effect: " I forbid that one of you two who does not
                        possess the house in question to use force in order to prevent the other who
                        is in possession, provided he is so neither by clandestine or violent
                        exclusion of the.first, nor in virtue of a grant from him during pleasure,
                        from continuing, to possess as at present." It is manifest that this decided
                        nothing; it was no more than a prohibition of disturbance of the <hi
                            rend="italic">status quo</hi> ; it left the question entirely open which
                        of the parties it was that was in possession, and which that was forbidden
                        to interfere. The manner of its explication was somewhat singular. Each of
                        the parties was bound at once to commit what in the case of one of them must
                        have been a breach of the interdict, by a pretence of violence offered to
                        the other <hi rend="italic">(vis ex conventu);</hi>

                        <hi rend="italic"/> each of them was thus in a position to say to the other:
                        " We have both used force; but it was you alone that did it in defiance of.
                        the interdict, for it is I that am in possession." The interim enjoyment, of
                        the house was then awarded to the highest bidder, who gave his stipulatory
                        promise to pay rent to his adversary in the event of the. latter being
                        successful in the long-run; penal sponsions and restipulations were
                        exchanged upon the question which of them had committed a breach of the
                        interdict; and on these,, four in number, <hi rend="italic">formulae</hi>
                        were adjusted and sent to a <hi rend="italic">judex</hi> for trial. If the
                        procedure could not thus be explicated, because either of the parties
                        declined to take part in the <hi rend="italic">vis ex conventu,</hi> or the
                        bidding, or the sponsions and restipulations, he was assumed to be in the
                        wrong, and, by what was called a secondary interdict, required to yield up
                        his possession or detention and to abstain from disturbing the other " in
                        all time coming." Whatever we may think of the action system of the Romans

                                rend="italic">Aktionen,</hi> ii. chap. 16. </note> was a stipulatory
                        engagement imposed upon a man by a magistrate or judge, in order to secure a
                        third party from the chance of. loss or prejudice through some act or
                        omission either of him from whom the engagement was exacted or of some other
                        person for whom he was responsible. Although called praetorian, because the
                        cases in which such stipulations were exigible were set forth in the Edict,
                        there can be no question that they originated in the <hi rend="italic">jus
                            civile}</hi> in fact, they were just a means of assuring to a man in
                        advance the benefit of an action of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile</hi>
                        whereby he might obtain reparation for any injury suffered by him through
                        the occurrence of the act or omission contemplated as possible. They were
                        enforced nearly always by granting or refusing an action or by <hi
                            rend="italic">missio in possessionem,</hi> Ulpian classifies them
                        (rather illogically) as cautionary <hi rend="italic">(cautionales),</hi>
                        judicial and common. The first were purely precautionary, and quite
                        independent of any action already in dependence between the party moving the
                        magistrate to exact the stipulation and him on whom it was desired to impose
                        it. There were many varieties of them, connected with all branches of the
                        law— for example, the. <hi rend="italic">cautio damni infecti,</hi> security
                        against damage to a man’s property in consequence, say, of the ruinous
                        condition of his neighbours house, the.cn«/i&lt;9 <hi rend="italic"
                            >usufrucluaria</hi> that property usufructcd should revert unimpaired to
                        the owner .on the expiry of the usufructuary’s life interest, the aedilian
                        stipulation against faults in a thing sold, and so forth. In all these cases
                        the stipulation or <hi rend="italic">cautio</hi> was a guarantee against
                        future loss or injury, usually corroborated by sureties, and made effectual,
                        by an action on. the stipulation in the event of loss or injury resulting.
                        Judicial stipulations, according to Ulpian’s classification, were those
                        imposed by a judge in the course of and with reference to an action in
                        dependence before him, as, for example, the <hi rend="italic">cautio
                            judicatum solvi</hi> (that the defendant would satisfy the judgment),
                        the <hi rend="italic">cautio de dolo</hi> (that a thing claimed in the
                        action would not be fraudulently impaired in the meantime) and many others.
                        Common were such as might either be imposed by a magistrate apart from any

                        to the imperial consistory alone that men looked for interpretation of old
                        law or promulgation of new.</p>
                   <p>In the reign of Diocletian rescripts were still abundant; but the
                        constitutions in the Theodosian and Justinianian Codes from the time of
                        Constantine downwards are mostly of a wider scope, and of the class known as
                        genera! or edictal laws <hi rend="italic">(leges generates edictales).</hi>
                        It would be wrong, however, to infer that rescripts had ceased; for
                        Justinian’s Code contains various regulations as to their form, and the
                        matter is dealt with again in one of his Novels. The reason why so few are
                        preserved is that they were no longer authoritative except for the parties
                        to whom they were addressed. This was expressly declared by the emperors
                        Arcadius and Honorius in 398 in reference to those they issued in answer to
                        applications for advice from officials; and it is not unreasonable to assume
                        that a limitation of the same sort had been put at an earlier date on the
                        authority of those addressed to private parties. Puchta is of opinion that
                        the enactment of Honorius ana Arcadius applied equally to <hi rend="italic"
                            >decreta,</hi> for the reason that during this period matters of
                        litigation did not come under the cognisance of the emperors except on
                        appeal, and that under the new arrangements of Constantine the judgment of
                        affirmance or reversal was embodied in a rescript addressed to the
                        magistrate from whom the appeal had been taken. The rule of Arcadius and
                        Honorius was renewed in 425 by Theodosius and Valentinian, who qualified it,
                        however, to this extent—that, if it contained any distinct indication that
                        the doctrine it laid down was meant to be of general application, then it
                        was to be received as an edict or <hi rend="italic">lex generalis,</hi> To
                        this Justinian adhered in so far as rescripts in the old sense of the word
                        were concerned; but he declared that his judgments <hi rend="italic"
                            >(decreta)</hi> should be received everywhere as laws of general

                        nascent Christianity with the humaner spirit which began to operate on some

                        of Seneca did quite as much—nay, far more—to influence it then than the
                        lessons that were taught in the little assemblies of the early converts. It
                        would be a bold thing to say that, had Christianity never gained its
                        predominance, that spirit of natural right would not have continued to
                        animate the course of legislation, and to evoke, as years progressed, most
                        of those amendments in the law of the family and the law of succession that
                        were amongst the most valuable contributions of the imperial constitutions
                        to the private law. It may well be that that spirit was intensified and
                        rendered more active with the growth of Christian belief; but not until the
                        latter had been publicly sanctioned by Constantine, and more especially
                        after Theodosius declared it to be the religion of the state, do we meet
                        with incontestable records of its influence.- We find them in enactments in
                        favour of the church and its property, and of its privileges as a legatee;
                        in those conferring or imposing on the bishops a supervision of charities
                        and charitable institutions, and. a power of interfering in matters of

                        in presence of two or three of the clergy and thereafter recorded in the

                        which heretics and apostates were visited, and in a variety of minor
                        matters. Of greater importance were three features for which it was directly
                        responsible—the repeal of the caduciary provisions of the Papia-Poppaean
                        law, the penalties imposed upon divorce, and the institution of the <hi

                   </p>
                   <p>The purpose of the caduciary law was to discourage celibacy and encourage
                        fruitful marriages; but legislation in such a spirit could not possibly be
                        maintained when celibacy had come to be inculcated as a virtue* and as the
                        peculiar characteristic of a holy life. The penalties alike of <hi
                            rend="italic">orbitas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">coelibatus</hi> were
                        abolished by Constantine in the year 320. The legislation about divorce,
                        from the first of Constantine’s enactments on the subject down to those of
                        Justinian, forms a miserable chapter in the history of the law. Not one.of
                        the emperors who.busied himself with the matter, undoing the ill* advised,
                        work of his predecessors and substituting legislation, of his own quite as
                        complicated and futile, thought of interfering with the old principle that
                        divorce ought to be as free as marriage and independent of the sanction or
                        decree of a judicial tribunal. Justinian was the first who, by one of his
                        Novels, imposed a condition on parties to a divorce of common accord <hi
                            rend="italic">(communi consensu)</hi> , namely, that they should both
                        enter a convent, otherwise it should be null.; but, so distasteful was this
                        to popular feeling, and so little conducive to improvement of the tone of
                        morals within the conventual precincts, that it was repealed by his
                        successor. The legislation of Justinian’s predecessors and the bulk of his
                        own were levelled at one-sided repudiations, imposing, penalties, personal
                        and patrimonial (1) upon the author of a repudiation on some ground the law
                        did not recognize^ as. sufficient—ana the lawful grounds varied almost from
                        reign to reign—and (2) upon the party whose misconduct gave rise to a
                        repudiation that was justifiable. The bishop’s court <hi rend="italic"
                            >(episcopate judicium, episcopates audientia)</hi> had its origin in the
                        practice of the primitive Christians, in accordance with the apostolic
                        precept, of submitting their differences to one or two of their brethren in
                        the faith, usually a presbyter or bishop, who acted as arbiter. On the state
                        recognition of Christianity the practice obtained legislative sanction,
                        Constantine giving the bishop’s court concurrent jurisdiction with the
                        ordinary civil courts where both parties preferred the former, and by a
                        later enactment (whose authenticity, however, is open to some doubt) going
                        so far as to empower one of the parties to a suit to remove it to the
                        ecclesiastical tribunal against the will of the other. He also declared that
                        the judgments were to be enforced by the civil courts. <note anchored="true"

                        proper discharge of his spiritual functions, so that in 398 Arcadius in the
                        Eastern Empire judged it expedient to revert to Constantine’s original rule,
                        and, at least as regarded laymen, to limit the right of resort to the
                        episcopal judicatory to cases in which both parties consented. The same
                        thing was done by Valentinian in the Western Empire in 452. It is impossible
                        to say with any approach to exactitude what effect this intervention of the

                        was of infinite advantage to the law; for the judgment was as a rule that of
                        a free and independent citizen* untrammelled by officialism, fresh from some
                        centre of business, chosen by, and in full sympathy with, the parties
                        between whom he had to decide. Such a system was incompatible with the
                        autocratic government of Diocletian and Constantine; and it is with no
                        surprise that we find the former of these sovereigns instructing the
                        provincial governors that in future, unless w'hen prevented by . pressure of
                        business (or, according to a later constitution of Julian’s, when the matter
                        was of trifling importance), they were not to remit them but were themselves
                        to hear the causes brought.before them from first to last, as had previously
                        been the practice in the <hi rend="italic">extraordinariae cognitiones.</hi>
                        The remit in the excepted cases was not, as formerly, to a private citizen,
                        but to what was called a <hi rend="italic">judex pedaneus,</hi> who acted as
                        an inferior substitute of the magistrate and was probably a matriculated
                        member of the local bar; and for a time his delegated authority was embodied</p>
                   <p>in a <hi rend="italic">formula</hi> after the old fashion. But even this
                        exceptional use of it did not long survive, for an enactment by the two sons
                        of Constantine, conceived in terms the most comprehensive, declared fixed
                        styles to be but traps for the unwary, and forbade their use in any legal
                        act whatever, whether contentious or voluntary. The result was, not only the
                        formal disappearance of the distinction between the proceedings <hi
                            rend="italic">in jure</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in judicio
                            (judicium</hi> receiving a more extensive meaning) but the practical
                        (though not formal) disappearance also of the distinctions between actions
                            <hi rend="italic">in jus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">in factum,</hi> and
                        between <hi rend="italic">actiones directae</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                            >actiones utiles,</hi> the conversion of the interdict into an <hi

                        by the aid of officers of the law.</p>

                        —the procedure by which a plaintiff himself brought his adversary into

                            >vadimonium.</hi> In the earlier part of the period the proceedings
                        commenced with the <hi rend="italic">litis denuntiatio</hi> introduced in
                        the time of Marcus Aurelius and remodelled by Constantine; but under
                        Justinian (though probably begun before his reign) the initial step was what
                        was. called the <hi rend="italic">libellus conventionis.</hi> This was a
                        short and precise written statement addressed by the plaintiff to the court,
                        explaining (but without detail) the nature of the action he proposed to
                        raise and the claim he was making, which was accompanied by a formal
                        undertaking to proceed with the cause and follow it out to judgment, under
                        penalty of having to pay double costs to the defendant. If the judge was
                        satisfied of the relevancy of the libel, he pronounced an interlocutor <hi
                            rend="italic">(interlocutio)</hi> ordaining its service on the
                        respondent; this was done by an officer of the court, who cited him to
                        appear on a day named, usually at a distance of one or two months. The
                        defendant, through the officer, had to. put in an answer <hi rend="italic"
                            >(libellus contradictions),</hi> at the same time giving security for
                        the proper maintenance of the defence and eventual satisfaction of the
                        judgment. If defendant did not appear after three summonses the case was
                        heard and decree given in his absence. On the day appointed the parties or
                        their procurators were first heard on any dilatory pleas, such as defect of
                        jurisdiction;if none were offered, or those stated repelled, they then
                        proceeded to expound their respective grounds of action and defence, each
                        finally making oath of his good faith in the matter <hi rend="italic"
                            >(juramentum calumniae),</hi> and their counsel doing the same.</p>
                   <p>From this point, which marked the <hi rend="italic">litis contestatio</hi>
                        or joinder of issue, the procedure was much the same as that <hi
                            rend="italic">in judicio</hi> under the formular system. Evidence was
                        taken and judgment given. But in all cases in which the demand was that a
                        particular thing should be given or restored, and the plaintiff desired to
                        have the thing itself rather than damages, execution might be specific and
                        effected through officers of the law <hi rend="italic">(manu militari).</hi>
                        Where, on the other hand, the condemnation was pecuniary, the usual course,
                        where performance was not made, was for the judge, through his officers, to
                        take possession of such things belonging to the defendant as were thought
                        sufficient to satisfy the judgment <hi rend="italic">(pignus</hi>

                   <p>This constitution has always been regarded as a signal proof of the
                        lamentable condition into which jurisprudence had sunk in the beginning of
                        the 5th century. Constantine, a hundred years earlier, had condemned the
                        notes of Ulpian and Paul upon Papinian. There were no longer any living
                        jurists to lay down the law <hi rend="italic">(jura condere)</hi> ; and, if
                        it was to be gathered from the writings of those who were dead, it was
                        perhaps as well that the use of them should be regulated. The Valentinian
                        law proceeded so far in the same direction. It made a selection of the
                        jurisconsults of the past whose works alone were to be allowed to be
                        cited,—Papinian, Paul, Ulpian and Modestine, the four latest patented
                        counsel of any distinction; Gaius, ol authority previously only in the
                        schools, but whose writings were now approved universally, notwithstand* ing
                        that he had never possessed the <hi rend="italic">jus respondendi',</hi> and
                        all the earlier jurists whose dicta these five had accepted. But it went yet
                        a step further, for it declared all of them, with the sole exception of
                        Papinian, to be ol the same authority, and degraded the function of the
                        judge in most cases—so far at least as a question of law was concerned—to.
                        the purely arithmetical task of counting up the names which the industry of
                        the advocates on either side had succeeded in adducing in support of these
                        respective contentions. It is probable that, from the days of Hadrian down
                        to Severus Alexander, when the emperor in his council had to frame a
                        rescript or a decree, its tenor would be decided by the vote of the
                        majority; but that was after argument and counter-argument, which must in
                        many cases have modified first impressions. Taking the votes of dead men,
                        who had not heard each other’s reasons for their opinions, was a very
                        different process. It may have been necessary; but it can have been so only
                        because a living jurisprudence had no existence,—because the constructive
                        talent of the earlier Empire had entirely disappeared.</p>

                        Empire, apparently at the end of the 3rd century, but at any rate not later
                        than the year 324. As, however, it contains a constitution of the year 365
                        there must have been subsequent additions to it. Only fragmentary remains of
                        it are extant, obtained from the same sources as the</p>
                   <p>Gregorian. Its author was a certain Hermogenianus (perhaps the jurist of
                        that name cited in the Digest), and the work seems to have been intended as
                        a sort of supplement to the Gregorian Code. It was a smaller work than the
                        latter, being divided only into titles, and, unlike it, contains no
                        pre-Diocletian constitutions. . It has, however, a great number of
                        contemporary ones, issued by Diocletian especially during the years 293 and
                        294. It was from this work and that of Gregorius that Justinian obtained the
                        constitutions contained in his Code for the period prior to Constantine, and
                        from the language he uses about the two Codes it would seem that they had
                        been regarded in the courts before his time as the only authoritative record
                        of constitutions during the period covered by them.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Codex Theodosianus.—</hi> In the year 429 the emperor
                        Theodosius nominated a commission of nine persons to collect the
                        constitutions issued by the emperors from Constantine to his own reign. From
                        the term soft he edict appoint! ng them he seems to have intended to
                        initiate the preparation of a body of law which, if his scheme had been
                        carried into execution, would have rendered that of Justinian unnecessary.
                        In a constitution about ten years later he explains the motives that had
                        actuated him: that he saw with concern the poverty-stricken state of
                        jurisprudence and how few men therewerewho, notwithstanding the prizes that
                        awaited them, were able to make themselves familiar with the whole range of
                        law; and that he attributed it very much to the multitude of books and</p>
                   <p>the lar^e mass of statutes through which the law was dispersed, and which it
                        was next to impossible for any ordinary mortal to master. His.scheme was
                        eventually to compile one single code from materials derived alike from the
                        writings of the jurists, the Gregorian and Hermogenian collections of
                        rescripts, and the constitutions from the time of. Constantine downwards.
                        His language leaves little doubt that it was his intention to have this
                        general code carefully prepared, so as to make it a complete exponent of the
                        existing law, which should take the place of everyth ing, statutory or
                        jurisprudential, of an earlier date. The collection 01 constitutions which
                        he directed his commissioners meantime to prepare, and which was to contain
                        even those that were merely of historical interest (provided only it was
                        made clear how later enactments had affected them), was to be the first step
                        in the execution of his project. For some reason or other nothing followed
                        upon this enactment, and in 435 a new commission of sixteen persons was
                        nominated to collect the constitutions, but nothing was said in their
                        instructions about anything ulterior. They were directed, however, to deal
                        with their material in a systematic way, as by arranging the constitutions
                        chronologically under definite titles, separating, where necessary, any
                        constitutions dealing with more than one matter into parts, so as to bring
                        each matter under its proper title, and with power otherwise to make such
                        omissions, additions and alterations as seemed good to .them for the same
                        object. The work was completed in less than three years and published at
                        Constantinople early in the yeai 438, with the declaration that it should
                        take effect from the 1st of January following, and a copy was sent to
                        Valentinian, who notified it to the senate at Rome and ordained that it
                        should come into force, in the West from the 12th of January 439. The
                        arrangement is in sixteen books, subdivided into titles with rubrics in
                        which the constitutions are as a rule (though not consistently) placed in
                        chronological order. They cover the whole field of law, private and public,
                        civil and criminal, fiscal and administrative, military and ecclesiastical.
                        The private law is contained in the first five books. This code was usually
                        called an later documents “ Theodosianus,’’ without <hi rend="italic"
                            >codex</hi> adjected. All constitutions since Constantine not contained
                        in it were abrogated. The manuscripts in which it has come down to us are
                        very defective, but many lacunae have been filled up from other sources,
                        especially from Alaric’s Breviary. Unfortunately the lacunae are principally
                        in the books relating to the private law. <note anchored="true"

                        Valentinian III. in 447, was published by the latter emperor in the

                        law mentioned in this section, there were several official collections made
                        prior to Justinian in Western Europe, after it had fallen under the dominion
                        of Gothic and other kings. There are three of these which require special
                        notice—each of them compiled from documentary sources of ante-Justinian law.
                        Though of considerable use in explicating difficulties and filling, up
                        lacunae in the earlier law sources, they must be used with caution.for that
                        purpose, as they contain not a few corruptions of the original texts. They</p>
                   <p>                        are:—

                        the Ostrogoths, not long after the year 500 (not later than 515). Theoderic
                        after he had conquered Italy</p>

                   <p>acknowledged his suzerainty. He did not aim at being an independent
                        legislator, and his Edict is therefore of limited scope and in no proper
                        sense a code. Its materials were</p>
                   <p>mainly drawn, without however indication given, from the writings of Paul,
                        the Gregorian, Hermogenian and Theodosian Codes, and the post-Theodosian
                        Novels. Divided into 155 chapters, with no systematic arrangement, it
                        touches upon.all branches of the law, public and private, but especially
                        criminal law and procedure. Though it contains a certain infusion of Gothic
                        law and was professedly intended to apply to all Theoderic's subjects, both
                        Goths and Romans, it seems nevertheless generally admitted that this idea
                        cannot have been fully realized, and that in some matters with which it
                        deals, <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi> the law of the family, Gothic customs
                        must still have continued to prevail for Gothic subjects.</p>

                        last mentioned. It was compiled by a commission of lawyers appointed by
                        Alaric II.. king of the Western Goths, with approval of the bishops and
                        nobles, and published at Aire in Gascony in tne year 506. The compilers
                        selected their material partly from the <hi rend="italic">leges</hi>
                        (imperial constitutions after Diocletian) and partly from the <hi

                        except in the way of excision of passages that were obsolete or superseded.
                        For the <hi rend="italic">leges</hi> they, utilized some aoo of the 3400
                        enactments (according to Haenel’s estimate) of the Theodosian Code and about
                        30 of the Post-Theodosian Novels; for the <hi rend="italic">jus</hi> they
                        made use of Paul’s Sentences, Gaius’s Institutes (in a corrupt ana greatly

                        these, except Gaius (for the reason mentioned), were accompanied by <hi

                        which resemble the interpretation of the XII. Tables in that they are often
                        not so much explanatory of the text as qualificative or corrective. The
                        Breviary exercised great influence in western Europe; and there is no

                        and procedure, distributed through forty-seven titles, and is arranged much
                        in the same order as the <hi rend="italic">Gundobada,</hi> from which it has

                        sort of supplement to the Breviary, being often bound in the same volume

                   <p>Taking his enactments in the Code and his Novels together, we have of
                        Justinian’s own legislation not far short of 600 constitutions. Diocletian’s
                        contributions to the Code are more than twice as numerous; but most of them
                        professed to be nothing more than short declaratory statements of
                        pre-existing law, whereas Justinian’s, apart from his Fifty Decisions, were
                        mostly reformatory enactments, many of those in the Novels as long as an
                        average act of parliament, and often dealing with diverse matters under the
                        same rubric. They cover the whole field of law, public and private, civil
                        and criminal, secular and ecclesiastical. It cannot be said that they afford
                        pleasant reading: they are so disfigured by redundancy of language, involved
                        periods and nauseous self-glorification. But it cannot be denied that many
                        of those which deal with the private law embody reforms of great moment and
                        of most salutary tendency. The emperor sometimes loved to pose as the
                        champion of the simplicity and even-handedness of the early law, at others
                        to denounce it for its subtleties; sometimes he allowed himself to be
                        influenced by his own extreme asceticism, and now and again we detect traces
                        of subservience to the imperious will of his consort; but in the main his
                        legislation was dictated by what he was pleased to call <hi rend="italic"
                            >humanitas</hi> so far as the law of persons was concerned, and by <hi

                        concerned that of things. The result was the eradication of almost every

                        disappeared of the old conception of the/ami/ia as an aggregate of persons
                        and estate subject absolutely to the power and dominion of its head. <hi
                            rend="italic">Manus,</hi> the power in a husband over his wife and her
                        belongings, was a thing of the past; both stood now on a footing of equality
                        before the law; perhaps it might be more accurate to say, at least with
                        reference to the Justinianian legislation, that the wife was the more
                        privileged of the two in respect both of the protection and the indulgence
                        the law accorded her.</p>
                   <p>With <hi rend="italic">manus</hi> the old. confarreation and coemption had
                        ceased, marriage needing nothing more than simple interchange of.consent,
                        except as between persons of rank <hi rend="italic">{illustres)</hi> or
                        when.the intention was to legitimate previous issue; in the latter case a
                        written marriage settlement <hi rend="italic">{instrumentum dotale)</hi> was
                        required, and in the former both such a settlement and a marriage in church
                        before the bishop and. at least three clerical witnesses, who granted and
                        signed a certificate of the completed union. The legislation of.the
                        Christian emperors on the subject of divorce, largely contributed to by
                        Justinian in his Novels, has already been referred to. In regard to the <hi
                            rend="italic">dos,</hi> many new provisions were introduced,,
                        principally, for curtailing the husband’s power of dealing with it while the
                        marriage lasted, enlarging the right of the wife, and her heirs in respect
                        of it, and simplifying the means of recovering it from the husband or his</p>
                   <p>heirs when the marriage was dissolved. Between the time of Constantine and
                        that of Theodosius and Valentinian a new form of matrimonial settlement
                        became established, ft became apparently a legally sanctioned practice for a
                        man to make (apart from ordinary marriage presents) a settlement on his
                        intended wife cither by actual transfer or by promise of a provision which
                        was to remain his property (though without the power of alienation) during
                        the marriage, but to pass to her on his predecease or on divorce by his
                        fault. This got the name of <hi rend="italic">donatio ante nuptias,</hi> or
                        sometimes, as being a sort of counterpart for the <hi rend="italic">dos,
                            antipherna.</hi> There was some important legislation about it by the
                        two last-mentioned emperors; Leo and Justin followed suit; and Justinian, in
                        his Code and Novels, published five or six enactments for its regulation.
                        The general result was that, wherever a <hi rend="italic">dos</hi> was given
                        or promised on the part of the wife, there a <hi rend="italic">donatio</hi>
                        of equal amount was to be constituted on the part of the husband; that, if
                        one was increased during the marriage, a corresponding increase was to be
                        made to the other; that it might be constituted or increased after the
                        marriage without infringing the rule prohibiting donations between husband
                        and wife, which caused Justinian to change its name to <hi rend="italic"
                            >donatio propter nuptias;</hi> that the wife might demand its transfer
                        to her (to tne same extent as she could that of the <hi rend="italic"
                            >dos)</hi> on her husband’s insolvency, but under obligation to apply
                        its income to the maintenance of the family; and that on the dissolution of
                        the marriage by her husband's death or by a divorce for which he w <hi
                            rend="sup">f</hi> as in fault, she had an hypothec and other ample
                        remedies for reducing it into possession. <note anchored="true"

                   <p>The change in the complexion of the relations between husband and wife under
                        the Christian emperors, however, was insignificant when compared with that w
                        hich had overtaken the relation between parent and child. Justinian in his
                        Institutes reproduces the boast of Gaius that nowhere else had a father such
                        power over his children as was exercised by a Roman <hi rend="italic"
                            >paterfamilias.</hi> True it is that the <hi rend="italic">patria
                            potestas</hi> in name still held a prominent place in the Justin-íanian
                        collections; but it had been shorn of most.of the prerogatives that had
                        characterized it in earlier periods. To expose a newborn child was forbidden
                        under penalties. To take the life of a grownup one—unless it was a daughter
                        slain with her paramour, in the act of adultery—was murder; for the domestic
                        tribunal, with the judicial power of life and death in the <hi rend="italic"
                            >paterfamilias</hi> as its head, had long disappeared.</p>
                   <p>Further, a parent could no longer sell his child save only when the child
                        was an infant and he in such extreme poverty as to be unable to support it.
                        Even the right to make a noxal surrender of his son to a party who had
                        suffered from the latter’s delict had silently become obsolete; so greatly
                        had altered sentiment, in sympathy with, legislation, curtailed the power of
                        the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> over those in his <hi rend="italic"
                            >potestas.</hi> This <hi rend="italic">noxae deditio</hi> was formally
                        abolished by Justinian. All that remained of the <hi rend="italic">patria
                            potestas,</hi> in short, in the Justinianian law was little more than
                        would be sanctioned in most modern systems as natural emanations of the
                        paternal relationship.</p>
                   <p>Thus he had right of moderate chastisement for offences (for the infliction
                        of graver punishments he had to apply to the magistrate), of testamentary
                        nomination of guardians, of pupillary substitution (enlarged by Justinian),
                        and of withholding consent from the marriage, of a child, but subject in
                        this last ease to magisterial intervention if used unreasonably.</p>
                   <p>How the right of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi> over the earnings
                        and acquisitions of his children was modified by the recognition of the <hi
                            rend="italic">peculium castrense</hi> has been shown in a previous page.
                        But the modification was carried to such an extent by.the Christian emperors
                        as finally to negative the father’s ownership altogether, except as regarded
                        acquisitions that were the outcome of funds advanced by him to his child for
                        his separate use <hi rend="italic">{peculium profecticium).</hi> Of some of
                        the child's acquisitions <hi rend="italic">{bona. adventicia)</hi> his
                        father had, down to.the time of Justinian, the life interest and right of
                        administration; but by his legislation even these might be excluded at the
                        pleasure of the parties from whom the acquisitions had been derived or by
                        maladministration of the father.</p>
                   <p>By the classical law the father’s radical right in his son’s <hi
                            rend="italic">peculium castrense</hi> revived on the latter’s death; for
                        if he died intestate the former appropriated it not as his son’s heir, but
                        as an owner whose powers as such had been merely temporarily suspended. But
                        by one of the chapters in the famous 118th Novel on the law of intestate
                        succession even this prerogative of the <hi rend="italic">paterfamilias</hi>
                        was abolished, and all a child’s belongings except his <hi rend="italic"
                            >peculium profecticium</hi> were recognized as his own in death as.well
                        as in life, so that if any of them should pass to his parent on his
                        intestacy it should only be by title of inheritance and in the absence of
                        descendants.</p>
                   <p>In every other branch of the law of the family the same reforming spirit was
                        manifested. Adoption of <hi rend="italic">filiafamilias</hi> was no longer
                        followed in all cases by a change of family for the adoptee, but only when
                        either the adopter was in fact one of his ancestors in whose</p>

                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi> he had never been, such as a paternal or
                        maternal grandfather, when there was a natural <hi rend="italic"
                            >potestas</hi> to underlie and justify the civil one—or when an ancestor
                        gave in adoption a grandchild who was in his <hi rend="italic">potestas</hi>
                        but would not become <hi rend="italic">sui juris</hi> by his death. The mode
                        of strict adoption also was simplified, the old procedure by sales and
                        manumissions, which degraded the child too much to the level of a slave, was
                        abolished. The modes of legitimation of children born of a concubine,
                        especially that by subsequent marriage of the parents, first introduced by
                        Constantine, were regulated, and the extent of the rights of the legitimated
                        issue carefully defined. Emancipation was simplified in a similar way to
                        that of strict adoption. Tutory at law was opened to the pupil's nearest
                        kinsman, whether on ’the father’s side or the mother’s; and the mother
                        herself, or the child's grandmother, might be allowed, under certain
                        conditions, to act as its guardian. Slavery was often converted into the
                        milder condition of colonate; but, even where this did not happen, the
                        rights of owners were not allowed to be abused; for slaves were permitted to
                        claim the protection of the magistrate, and cruelty by a master might result
                        in his being deprived of his human property. Kinship that had arisen between
                        two persons when one or both were slaves <hi rend="italic"
                            >(serviliscognatio)</hi> was recognized as creative not only of
                        disabilities but of rights. The modes of manumission were multiplied, and
                        the restriction of the legislation of the early empire abolished; and a
                        freedman invariably became a citizen, Junian Latinity and dediticiancy being
                        no longer recognized.</p>

                        simplification of the forms of conveyance, the extension of the colonate,
                        the introduction and regulation of emphyteusis and the remodelling of the
                        law of prescription. Simplification of the forms of conveyance was necessary
                        only in the case of <hi rend="italic">resmancipi,</hi> for <hi rend="italic"
                            >resnecmancipt</hi> had always passed by deliveiy. From the Theodosian
                        Code it is apparent that movable <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> usually
                        passed in the same way from very early in the period, and that for the
                        mancipation of lands and houses—for <hi rend="italic">in jure cessio</hi>
                        had disappeared with the formular system— <hi rend="italic">asolemnis

                        and both before witnesses, had been gradually substituted. Of this there is
                        no trace in the Justinianian Code. For Justinian abolished all remains of
                        the distinction between <hi rend="italic">res mancipi</hi> and <hi
                            rend="italic">res nec mancipi,</hi> between full ownership, bonitarian

                        conveyance was concerned. But, as regarded the possession required of an
                        acquirer to cure any defect in the conveyance, he made a marked difference
                        between immovables and movables. For, amalgamating the old positive,

                        distinguishable from ownership. It conferred upon him and his heirs a
                        perpetual right in the lands included in the grant, in consideration of a
                        fixed annual payment to the lord <hi rend="italic">(canon)</hi> and due
                        observance of conventional and statutory conditions; but he was not entitled
                        to abandon it, nor able to free himself of the obligations he had
                        undertaken, without the lord’s consent. The latter was entitled to hold the
                        grant forfeited if the <hi rend="italic">canon</hi> fell into arrear for
                        three years (in church lands for two), or if the land-tax was in arrear for
                        the same period, or if the <hi rend="italic">emphyteuta</hi> allowed the

                        statutory requirements. These were that he should intimate an intended
                        alienation and the name of the intended alienee to the lord, so that the
                        latter, before giving his assent, might satisfy himself that he would not be
                        a loser by the transaction; and, if the alienation was to be by sale, he had
                        to state the price fixed, so as to give the lord the opportunity of
                        exercising his statutory right of pre-emption at the same figure. If those
                        requirements were complied with, and. the lord (himself declining to
                        purchase) stated no reasonable objection to the proposed alienee, he was not
                        entitled to resist the alienation, provided a payment <hi rend="italic"
                            >(laudemium)</hi> was made.to him of 2% of the sale price or of the
                        value of the lands in consideration of his enforced consent.</p>
                   <p>The changes in the law of obligation were more superficial than those in the
                        law of property, and consisted principally in the simplification of
                        formalities and in some cases in their entire abolition. To describe them,
                        however, would carry us into details which would here be out of place.</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Changes in the Law of Succession.—</hi> The changes made
                        in the law of succession by Justinian’s Christian predecessors, especially
                        Theodosius 11. and Anastasius, were far from insignificant; but hisown were
                        in somedirectionspositively revolutionary.</p>
                   <p>The testament <hi rend="italic">per aes et libram</hi> of the/us <hi
                            rend="italic">civile</hi> probably never obtained any firm footing in
                        the East; for it was only by Caracalla’s constitution conferring citizenship
                        on all his free subjects that provincials generally acquired <hi
                            rend="italic">testamenli factio;</hi> and by that time a testament
                        bearing.externally the requisite number of seals had been recognized as
                        sufficient for a grant of <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio</hi>
                        unchallengeable by the heirs-at-law, even though they were able to prove
                        that neither <hi rend="italic">familiae mancipatio</hi> nor <hi
                            rend="italic">testamenli nuncupatio</hi> had intervened. Hence th£
                        universal adoption of what Justinian calls the praetorian testament, which,
                        however, underwent considerable reform at the hands of the emperors, notably
                        Theodosius 11. and Valentinian 111., in the requirement (in the ordinary
                        case) of signature by the testator and subscription by the witnesses,
                        thereby becoming what Justinian calls the tripartite testament. There was
                        much hesitating legislation on the subject before the law was finally
                        established as it stands in the Justinianian books; and even at the last we
                        find it encumbered with many exceptions and reservations in favour of
                        testaments that were merely deeds of division by a parent among his
                        children, testaments made in time of plague, testaments made before a
                        magistrate and recorded in books of court, testaments entrusted to the safe
                        keeping of the emperor, and so forth. Codicils had become deeds of such
                        importance as, in the absence of a testament, to be dealt with as imposing a
                        trust on the heir-at-law; it was therefore thought expedient to deny effect
                        to them unless attested by at least five witnesses. And a most important
                        step in advance was taken by Justinian in the recognition of the validity of
                        an o <hi rend="sup">r</hi> al <hi rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> trust; for
                        he declared that, if it should be represented to a competent judge that a
                        person on his death-bed had.by word of mouth directed his heir to give
                        something to the complainant, the heir should be required either on his oath
                        to deny the averment or to give or pay what was claimed. <note

                   <p>In the matter of intestacy there had been long a halting between two
                        opinions—a desire still further to amend the law in the direction taken by
                        the praetors and by the legislature in the Ter-tullian and Orphitian
                        senatusconsults, and yet a hesitancy about breaking altogether from the
                        time-hallowed principle of agnation. Justinian in his Code went far beyond
                        his predecessors, making a mother’s right of succession independent
                        altogether of the <hi rend="italic">jus liberorum;</hi> extending that of a
                        daughter or sister to her descendants, without any deduction in favour of
                        agnates. thus excluded; admitting emancipated collaterals and their
                        descendants as freely as if there had been no <hi rend="italic">capitis
                            deminutio minima;</hi> applying to agnates the same <hi rend="italic"
                            >successio graduum</hi> that the praetors had allowed to cognates, and
                        so forth. But it was by his Novels, especially the 118th and 127th, that he
                        revolutionized the system, by eradicating agnation altogether (except as
                        regard? adopted children) and settling the canons of descent—which were the
                        same, for real and personal estate—solely on the basis of blood kinship,
                        whether through males or females, and whether crossed or not by a <hi

                        different degrees. Failing descendants, the succession passed to the nearest
                        ascendants, and, concurrently with them, to brothers and sisters of full
                        blood <hi rend="italic">(germani)</hi> and (by Nov. 127) the children of any
                        that had predeceased. Where there were ascendants alone, one-half of the
                        succession went to the paternal line and one-half to the maternal; where
                        there were ascendants and brothers and sisters, or only brothers and
                        sisters, the division was made equally <hi rend="italic">per capita;</hi>

                        sisters of half blood and their children, and grandchildren of brothers and
                        sisters german; the division here was on the same principle as in the second
                        class. The fourth class included all other collaterals according to
                        propinquity, apparently to the remotest degree, and without distinction
                        between full and half blood;</p>

                   <p>but among those the nearest in degree excluded the more remote, and when all

                   <p>A reform effected by Justinian by his 115th Novel ought not to pass
                        unnoticed; for it rendered superfluous all the old rules about disherison
                        and praeterition of a testator’s children, practically abolished <hi
                            rend="italic">bonorum possessio contra tabulas</hi> as regards freeborn
                        persons and established the principle that a child had, as a general rule,
                        an inherent and indefeasible right to be one of his father’s heirs in a
                        certain share at all events of his succession, and that a parent had the
                        same right in the succession of his child if the latter had died without
                        issue. The enactment enumerated certain grounds upon which alone it should
                        be lawful for a parent to disinherit his child or a child his parent,
                        declaring that in every case of disherison the reason of it should be stated
                        in the testament, but giving leave to the person disinherited to dispute and
                        disprove the facts when the testament was opened. If a child who had not
                        been disinherited-y-and one improperly disinherited was eventually in the
                        same position—was not instituted to some share, however small, of his
                        parent’s <hi rend="italic">hereditas,</hi> he was entitled to have the
                        testament declared, null in so far as the institutions in it were concerned,
                        thus opening the succession to himself and the other heirs-at-law, but
                        without affecting accessory provisions, such as bequests., nominations of
                        tutors, &amp;c.; and if the share to which he was instituted was less
                        than his legitim <hi rend="italic">(legitima</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                            >debita portio)</hi> he was entitled to an action in supplement. The
                        legitim, which under the practice of the centum viral court had been
                        one-fourth of the share to which the child would have been entitled <hi
                            rend="italic">ab intestato,</hi> had been raised by Justinian (by Novel
                        18) to one-third at least, and one-half where there were five or.more
                        entitled to participate. He did not allow challenge of the will to be
                        excluded, as in the earlier <hi rend="italic">querela inofficiosi
                            testamentó,</hi> because the testator had made advances to his child
                        during his life or left him a legacy which quantitatively equalled the
                        legitim; his idea was that a child was entitled to recognition by his parent
                            <hi rend="italic">as one of his heirs,</hi> and that to deny him that
                        position without statutory grounds was to put upon</p>
                   <p>him an indignity which the law would not permit.</p>
                   <p>Amongst the other beneficial changes effected by Justinian may be mentioned
                        the assimilation so far as possible of <hi rend="italic">hereditas</hi> and
                            <hi rend="italic">bonorum possessio,</hi> so that the latter might be
                        taken like the former without formal petition for a grant of it; the
                        cquiparation of legacies and singular trust-gifts, and the application of
                        some of their rules to <hi rend="italic">mortis causa</hi> donations; the
                        extension of the principle of “ transmission ” to every heir without
                        exception, so that, if he died within the time allowed him for considering
                        whether or not he would accept <hi rend="italic">(tempus deliberandi),</hi>
                        his power of acceptance or declinature passed to <hi rend="italic">his</hi>
                        heirs, to be exercised by them within what remained 01 the period; the
                        introduction of entry under inventory <hi rend="italic">(cum beneficio
                            inventarii),</hi> which limited the heir’s responsibilities and rendered
                        unnecessary the nine or twelve months of deliberation; and the application
                        of the principle of collation to descendants generally, so that they were
                        bound to throw into the mass of the succession before its partition every
                        advance</p>

                        the Institutes were primarily intended to serve as a text-book in the
                        schools, it was expressly declared that it and the Digest and the Code
                        should be regarded as just so many parts of one great piece of legislation
                        and all of equal authority; and that, although Digest and Code were but
                        collections of common law and legislation that had proceeded originally from
                        many different hands, yet they were to be treated with the same respect as
                        if they had. been the work of Justinian himself. But, while everything
                        within them was to be held as law, nothing outside them was to be looked at,
                        not even the volumes from which they had been collected; and so far did this
                        go that, after the publication in 534 of the revised Code, neither the first
                        edition of it nor the Fifty Decisions were allowed to be referred to. If a
                        case arose for which no precedent was to be found, the emperor was to be
                        resorted to for his decision, as being outside his collections the only
                        fountain of the law. To preserve the purity of the texts Justinian forbade
                        the use of conventional abbreviations <hi rend="italic">(sigla)</hi> in
                        making transcripts, visiting an offender with the penalties of falsification

                        were authorized, and indeed were necessary for many of his subjects; so were

                        passages, texts or individual titles. Commentaries and general summaries
                        were forbidden under heavy penalties, as an interference with the imperial

                        the Institutes; but .it contains a good many inaccuracies and its value has
                        been very differently rated by different critics. Its latest editor,
                        Ferrini, who puts a high estimate on it, is of opinion that the original of
                        it was a reproduction in Greek of Gaius, drawn up at Beirut, which was
                        remodelled after the plan of Justinian’s Institutes, and had the new matter
                        of this latter work subsequently incorporated in order to adapt it to the
                        altered conditions; but he denies that there is any sufficient authority for
                        ascribing it to Theophilus. If he be right in assuming that it was really
                        based on a redaction of Gaius, its historical explanations will be received
                        with all the more confidence. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                        Bologna school it was to a much greater extent from the Romano-Barbarian
                        codes than from the books of J ustinian that centrafand western Europe,
                        apart from Italy, derived their acquaintance with Roman law.. Theoderic’s
                        Edict can have had little influence after J ustinian's recovery of Italy,
                        and the Roma no-Burgundian law was no doubt gradually displaced by Alaric’s
                        Breviary after Burgundy had fallen into the hands of the Franks; but the
                        Breviary itself found its way in all directions in France and Germany,
                        penetrating even into England, mainly through the agency of the church.
                        There must, however, have been other repertories of Roman law in circulation
                        (and among others, probably either Gaius’s. Commentaries or Ulpian’s Rules),
                        as witness a testament made ¡n Paris in the end of the 7th century,
                        mentioned by Sa vigny as preserved by Mabillon, in which the testator uses
                        the old formula of the <hi rend="italic">jus civile,— “ ita do, ita lego,
                            ita testor, ita vos Quirites testimonium mihi per-hibetote,”</hi> words
                        that are not to be found either in the Visigothic or the Justinianian
                        collections. We know that in his pragmatic sanction of the year 554,
                        Justinian anew accorded his imperial sanction to the <hi rend="italic"
                            >jura</hi> and <hi rend="italic">leges, i.e.</hi> the Digest and Code,

                        declaring that his Novels were to be of the same authority there as in the
                        East. Two years after this came Julian’s Latin epitome of the Novels (a
                        private work by a Constantinopolitan professor), not improbably prepared by
                        command of the emperor himself. That Justinian’s works soon came</p>

                        caused in Italy for two centuries, and the barrier they formed between it
                        and the rest of Europe militated against the spread of the Justinianian law
                        northwards; but it was taught (from the 6th to the nth century) without much
                        interruption at law schools in Rome, and also at Ravenna, the scat of the
                        exarchs, to which (but this is doubtful) the school <hi rend="italic"
                            >{studium)</hi> of Rome, revived by Justinian, is said to have been
                        transferred in the nth century. By the Lombards, as their savagery toned
                        down, the Roman law was so far recognized that they allowed it to be applied
                        to the Romans living within their territory, and it is said even to have
                        been taught in Pavia, which they had established as their capital. Their
                        overthrow by Charlemagne opened an outlet for it beyond Italy; and there is
                        evidence that in the 9th century Justinian's works, or some of them, were
                        already circulating in the hands of the clergy in various parts of Europe.
                        Yet there are few remains of any literature of this period indicating much
                        acquaintance with them. The only writings worth mentioning are the so-called

                        It was at the very end of the nth century that at the law school of Bologna,
                        then under the guidance of the celebrated Irnerius, the study of Roman law
                        began somewhat suddenly to attract students from all parts of Europe. Partly
                        through ignorance and partly through the action of the clergy, the parts of
                        the Justinianian legislation that had hitherto been in ordinary use were the
                        Institutes, the Code and the Novels. The first, from its elementary
                        character, had naturally commended itself; the Code and the Novels, with
                        their abundant legislation on matters ecclesiastical, were in many respects
                        charters of the church’s privileges, and were prized accordingly; but the
                        Digest, as being the work of pagan jurists, had been looked on askance and
                        practically little used. The Code and the Novels, however, with their
                        modicum of wheat concealed in a great quantity of chaff, offered little
                        attraction to laymen of intelligence; and, when under the guidance of
                        Irnerius their attention was first concentrated on the Digest, it must have
                        come to them as a sort of revelation. Dogmatic and exegetic teaching of the
                            <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi> in all its parts was actively begun,
                        and a new school arose called the glossarists <hi rend="italic"
                            >{glossatores),</hi> of whom Irnerius has always been rightly regarded,
                        as the founder. This great man, who is said to have been trained both in
                        logic and rhetoric and to have afterwards studied and taught law at Rome
                        before coming to Bologna, w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> as more than a glossator.
                        He was also the first of the medievalists to treat the law in a scientific
                        way. In his <hi rend="italic">Summa Codicis</hi> (a work attributed to him
                        by Fitting on evidence which seems almost conclusive) he produced for his
                        contemporaries and successors an independently planned and. so far
                        systematic manual of the subject-matter of the Code, omitting the last three

                        (both grammatical and doctrinal) with which they furnished the texts of the</p>
                   <p>                        <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris</hi> which were in their hands. They also
                        wrote <hi rend="italic">summae, casus, brocarda,</hi> &amp;c., for use
                        both in the courts and the.schools, and occasionally special treatises. They
                        confined their work entirely to the <hi rend="italic">Corpus Juris,</hi>
                        being almost wholly ignorant of the history of the law. Beginning with
                        Irnerius, the school lasted for about a century and a half, and ended with
                        Franciscus Accursius, who died in 1260 after having made a systematic but
                        summarized collection of the glosses of his predecessors, which was
                        afterwards known as the <hi rend="italic">Glossa Ordinaria</hi> or “ The
                        Great Gloss.” Among the more famous representatives of the school (other
                        than Irnerius) were, in the 12th century, Bulgarus, Martinus, Jacobus and
                        Hugo, known as the <hi rend="italic">quattuor doctores,</hi> and Accursius
                        himself. To these may be added Placcntinus and Vacarius of the 12th and Azo
                        and Odofrcdus of the 13th century. The Digest, as used by the glossarists,
                        was divided into three parts, known as <hi rend="italic">Digestum Vetus</hi>
                        (books 1-24, tit. 2), <hi rend="italic">Infortiatum</hi> (books 24, tit-
                        3-38), and <hi rend="italic">Digestum Novum</hi> (books 39 to the end). The
                        manuscripts of these, as used by the glossarists, are called the Vulgate <hi
                            rend="italic">{lectio Vulgate),</hi> to distinguish them from the
                        Florentine Manuscript <hi rend="italic">{lectio Pisana),</hi> on which,
                        indeed (or on the same original source as it), they were probably all
                        primarily based, but from which, as far at least as book 33, they varied in
                        numerous readings. The historical explanation of the cause of this
                        just-mentioned threefold division is given by Mommsen in the preface to his
                        larger edition of the Digest, to which it will be sufficient to refer. <note

                        the Institutes; 134 of the Novels in Latin (known as the <hi rend="italic"

                            contained a more complete collection and correcter translation of the
                            Greek Novels than the Epitome of Julian. It was the one used in the law
                            courts in the middle ages. </note>

                   <p>The success of the Accursian gloss was rather detrimental to scientific
                        development of the law. It became a sort of code in itself which both in the
                        schools and the courts tended to supersede the texts of Justinian. The
                        intelligent study of the Sources was neglected while, lawyers devoted
                        themselves to subtle distinctions and useless divisions of subject-matter.
                        It led to the application during the 14th and 15th centuries of the methods
                        of scholasticism to the Roman law. The authors of this scholastic
                        jurisprudence, which prevailed during the greater part of these centuries,
                        have been called post-glossators and <hi rend="italic">scribentes</hi> or
                        commentators. Their most noted representative was Bartolus (1314-1357),
                        after whom they were often called Bartolists. This school, however (mainly
                        Italian), did much towards developing a definite system of common law in
                        Italy based on the Roman, and thereby facilitated the reception of Roman law
                        in Germany and other countries. <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                   <p>In the 16th century a new start or, so to say, second renaissance was given
                        to the Roman law. The study of classical antiquities, so active on the side
                        of literature, extended to jurisprudence also. The juridical writings which
                        had been handed down from the Romans ceased to be regarded purely as
                        positive law, binding according to the letter, but as a part of ancient
                        tradition whose spirit as well as form .must be examined by the light of the
                        past. Among the pioneers in this new method, to whom the name of Humanists
                        has been given, must be specially mentioned Alciatus (1492-1540), Cujacius
                        (1522-1590) and Donellus (1527-1591). Medievalism has passed away, and with
                        these jurists began what has been called the modern Roman law, to describe
                        which, however, is entirely beyond the province of this article. (H. Go.)
