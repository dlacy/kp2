<p><span class="font1">Congress political disagreement ripened soon into bitter enmity. As the quarrel developed Congress ignored the recommendations&nbsp;of the President, repassed by the requisite majority and without&nbsp;due consideration of his objections each measure that he&nbsp;vetoed, took from him the power to remove subordinates which&nbsp;had been exercised by his predecessors, deprived him of his&nbsp;constitutional rights as commander-in-chief of the army, and&nbsp;finally in 1868 undertook to drive him from office by impeachment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1867 Congress, under the control of the radical wing of the Republican party, set aside nearly all reconstructive work that&nbsp;had been accomplished previously and put into execution a plan&nbsp;of its own, under which the Southern States were reconstructed&nbsp;anew and admitted to representation in Congress between the&nbsp;years 1867 and 1870. Inevitable consequences of the Congressional plan of reconstruction were: first, the erection of&nbsp;state governments that were inefficient, corrupt, ruinously&nbsp;wasteful and shamefully oppressive; second, the extreme&nbsp;demoralization of the freedmen suddenly transformed from&nbsp;slaves into rulers of their former masters; third, the demoralization, in many cases also extreme, of the great body of the Southern&nbsp;whites by the expedients to which they resorted in order to&nbsp;escape from the rule of the freedman, led by the “ Carpet&nbsp;Bagger ” his Northern, and the “ Scalawag ” his Southern, white&nbsp;ally; fourth, the alienation of the white and coloured races in the&nbsp;South,—an alienation which was to each a source of immeasurable&nbsp;evils; fifth, the speedy overthrow’ on the withdrawal of military&nbsp;support of the governments set up under the Congressional&nbsp;plan, and the creation of a South “ solid ”,in resentful opposition&nbsp;to the North and the Republican party. And sixth, as the outcome of all these results, an unfortunate delay in reuniting&nbsp;North and South. The Republican party suffered during this&nbsp;period a moral decline, seen in the frequent efforts to gain party&nbsp;advantage by kindling anew the earlier sectional animosities,&nbsp;a growing arrogance, the increasing weight of the partisan and&nbsp;spoilsman in party management, and the widespread corruption&nbsp;that came to light in the “ scandals ” of the second administration of General Grant. The mismanaged Liberal Republican&nbsp;movement of 1870-1872 was a reaction against this moral&nbsp;decline and a protest against the Southern policy of the party&nbsp;and its support of the <sup>u</sup> Spoils ” system^ The service of the&nbsp;Liberal Republicans consisted mainly in the aid they gave to&nbsp;the reform of the RepubIican party and in the influence they&nbsp;exerted to induce the Democratic party to accept the results of&nbsp;the war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But despite the warnings it received, the prestige it had gained during the war and the popularity of President Grant, the&nbsp;Republican party lost ground steadily during the second half&nbsp;of the period. In the election of 1874 the Democratic party&nbsp;gained control of the House of Representatives; and in the&nbsp;election of 1876 came within a hair’s breadth of winning the&nbsp;presidency.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Election of Mr Hayes to that of Mr McKinley, 1876-1896.— </span><span class="font1">During these twenty years the subsidence of old and the rise of&nbsp;new issues led to a reconstruction of the party system, which,&nbsp;although less radical than that of 1840 to i860, brought into&nbsp;existence several new parties and changed in important- respects&nbsp;the character and policies of those already in the field. From&nbsp;the standpoint of party history the chief interest of these twenty&nbsp;years lies in the answer to the question, How did the discredited&nbsp;Republican party secure in 1896 a new and prolonged lease of&nbsp;power? The task was not easy. The reconstruction policy&nbsp;of the party had alienated many Northern supporters and had&nbsp;made the South solidly Democratic. The prevalence of the&nbsp;spoils system and the scandals of the second administration&nbsp;of General Grant had hurt the prestige of the party as a&nbsp;guardian of public morals and of thp national honour. What&nbsp;gave the Republicans a fighting chance were: its record down&nbsp;to the close of the- Civil War; its proven aptitude for the&nbsp;tasks of government; and the growth among the people of a&nbsp;more vital national feeling which turned instinctively to the&nbsp;party that had saved the nation. Despite these substantial&nbsp;advantages over their Democratic rivals thc Republicans lost&nbsp;the presidential elections of 1884 and 1892, and thc entire&nbsp;Democratic party—some Republicans agreeing—has always&nbsp;held that a just decision of thc contested election of 1876&nbsp;would have seated Samuel J. Tilden, thc Democratic candidate, instead of Mr Hayes. In thc Senate the Republicans&nbsp;were in a majority during fourteen years. In the House,&nbsp;whose members are chosen by popular vote, these figures&nbsp;were reversed, the Democrats having control during fourteen&nbsp;years. In each of five successive presidential elections,&nbsp;those of 1876, 1880, 1884, j888 and 1892, the Democratic&nbsp;popular vote was larger than thc Republican. Marked features&nbsp;of the party situation were the apparent similarity for a time&nbsp;of the principles of the two great parties, the influence on&nbsp;their policy exerted by the stronger minor parties, and the rise&nbsp;of the Mugwumps (not strictly a party), who claimed the right to&nbsp;vote for the best candidate' independently of party and were in&nbsp;the main of Republican origin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the issues of the period one, the reform of the civil service, was served by both of the great parties with imperfect fidelity.&nbsp;Each of thc Republican presidents, Hayes, Garfield, Arthur and&nbsp;Harrison gave it efficient and steadfast support; and so did&nbsp;Cleveland, the Democratic president, although under stronger&nbsp;pressure from party hunger. The same was true in the case of&nbsp;the more important questions of foreign policy and, to a degree&nbsp;in its early stage, of the question of silver coinage. It was not so&nbsp;with the treatment of the South. President Hayes<sub>t</sub>withdrew the&nbsp;national troops from S. Carolina and Louisiana and thus brought&nbsp;to an end Federal military interference with state governments.&nbsp;For this course a considerable section of the Republican party gave&nbsp;him thereafter a support which 'was half-hearted and inconstant.&nbsp;Further disaffection resulted‘from efforts to reform the civil&nbsp;service of New York which brought the President into conflict&nbsp;with the powerful Republican party machine in that state.@@<sup>1</sup> The&nbsp;high character of the President and his firm, wise and upright&nbsp;course raised the reputation of the party. His veto of the Silver&nbsp;Bill and the resumption of specie payments tended to the same&nbsp;result. The failure in 1889 of the third term movement for&nbsp;General Grant worked for the health of the party. The struggle of&nbsp;President Garfield with New York spoilsmen and his assassination by a disappointed office-seeker, gave a fresh impetus to the&nbsp;movement for the reform of the civil service. President Arthur&nbsp;maintained the high standard established by Presidents Hayes&nbsp;and Garfield.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">• In the election of 1884 the old parties were competitors for the confidence oj the conservative and reforming elements of the&nbsp;country. Mr Blaine, the Republican candidate, who in&nbsp;brilliancy, popularity, patriotism, and disappointing personal&nbsp;fortunes recalled the Whig leader, Henry Clay, lost the election&nbsp;by a narrow margin because, while meeting the requirements of&nbsp;the conservatives, he had lost in a measure the confidence of&nbsp;the reformers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the election of 1888 Mr Cleveland, by making tariff reform the issue, turned the manufacturing interests to the support of Mr&nbsp;Harrison, the candidate of the Republicans, who thereby WOn the&nbsp;election. Mr Harrison, while not personally popillar, maintained&nbsp;the best traditions of his Republican predecessors. The highly&nbsp;protective McKinley tariff, fraihed in obedience to the people’s&nbsp;mandate in 1888, proved somewhat disappointing, and in the&nbsp;election of 1892, Mr Cleveland, as the champion of lower tariff&nbsp;rates, was successful for the second time; AIr Cleveland, at the&nbsp;beginning of his second term, secured the repeal of the act for the&nbsp;purchase of silver, and thus strengthened himself with the conservatives of both parties. Democratic defection in the Senate&nbsp;nullified largely the downward revision of the tariff urged by&nbsp;the President and supported by the House.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The election of 1896 marked the close of the period of party</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> In the course of this conflict, which continued to disturb thc harmony of the Republican party until the death of President&nbsp;Garfield, the term “ Stalwarts ” was used to designate the supporters&nbsp;of Senator Conkling, who was in control of the Republican machine&nbsp;in New York state, and the term “ Half-Brecds ” to designate the&nbsp;supporters of the administration.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
