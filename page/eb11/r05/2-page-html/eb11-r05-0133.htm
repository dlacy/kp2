The Kuma, the Terek and the Kura, with the Aras,&nbsp;which receives the waters of Lake Gok-cha, belong to Caucasia.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The soil of Russia depends chiefly on the distribution of the boulder-clay and loess, on the degree to which the rivers have&nbsp;severally excavated their valleys, and on the moistness oí&nbsp;the climate. Vast areas in Russia are quite unfit for&nbsp;cultivation, 19% of the aggregate surface of European Russia&nbsp;(apart from Poland and Finland) being occupied by lakes, marshes,&nbsp;sand, &amp;c., 39% byj forests, 16% by prairies, and only 26% being&nbsp;under cultivation. The distribution of all these is, however, very&nbsp;unequal, and the five following subdivisions may be established:—&nbsp;(1) the tundras; (2) the forest region; (3) the middle region, comprising the surface available for agriculture and partly covered with&nbsp;forests; (4) the black-earth </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(chernozyom)</span><span class="font0"> region; and (5) the steppes.&nbsp;Of these the black-earth region—about 150,000,000 acres—which&nbsp;reaches from the Carpathians to the Urals, from the Pinsk marshes&nbsp;in the S.W. to the upper Oka in the N.E., is the most important.&nbsp;It. is covered with a thick sheet of black earth, a kind of loess, mixed&nbsp;with 5 to 15% of humus, due to the decomposition of an herbaceous&nbsp;vegetation, which developed luxuriantly during the Lacustrine&nbsp;period on a continent relatively dry even at that epoch. On the&nbsp;three-fields system corn has been grown upon it for fifty to seventy&nbsp;consecutive years without manure. Isolated black-earth islands,&nbsp;though less fertile, occur also in Courland and Kovno, in the Oka-Volga-Kama depression, on the slopes of the Urals, and in. a few&nbsp;patches in the N. Towards the Black Sea coast its thickness&nbsp;diminishes, and it disappears in the valleys. In the extensive&nbsp;region covered with boulder-clay the black earth appears only in&nbsp;isolated places, and the soil consists for the most part of a sandy clay,&nbsp;containing a much smaller admixture of humus. There cultivation&nbsp;is possible only with the aid of a considerable quantity of manure.&nbsp;Drainage finding no outlet through the thick clay, the soil of the&nbsp;forest region is often hidden beneath extensive marshes, and the&nbsp;forests themselves are often mere thickets choking marshy ground;&nbsp;large tracts of sand appear in the W., and the admixture of boulders&nbsp;w'ith. the clay in the N.W. renders agriculture difficult. On the&nbsp;Arctic coast the forests disappear, giving place to the tundras.&nbsp;Finally, in the S.E., towards the Caspian, on the slopes of the southern&nbsp;Urals and the plateau of Obshchiy Syrt, as also in the interior of&nbsp;the Crimea, and in several parts of Bessarabia, there are large tracts</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of real desert, buried under coarse sand and devoid of vegetation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notwithstanding the fact that Russia extends from N. to S. through 30<sup>o</sup> of latitude, the climate of its different portions, apart&nbsp;from the Crimea and Caucasia, presents a striking uniformity. The aerial currents—cyclones, anti-cyclones&nbsp;and dry S.E. winds—prevail over extensive areas, and sweep across&nbsp;the flat plains without hindrance. Everywhere the winter is cold&nbsp;and the summer hot, both varying in their duration, but differing&nbsp;relatively little in the extremes of temperature recorded. There is&nbsp;no place in Russia, Archangel and Astrakhan included, where the&nbsp;thermometer does not rise in summer nearly to 86° Fahr. and descend&nbsp;in winter to -13° and -22 <sup>o</sup>. It is only on the Black Sea coast that the&nbsp;absolute range of temperature does not exceed 108°, while in the&nbsp;remainder of Russia it reaches 126° to 141,, the oscillations being&nbsp;between -22<sup>o</sup> and -31 ®, occasionally going down as low as-54, and&nbsp;rising as high as 86° to 104°, or even 109®. Everywhere the rainfall&nbsp;is small•. if Finland and Poland on the one hand and Caucasia with&nbsp;the Caspian depression on the other be excluded, the average yearly&nbsp;rainfall varies between 16 and 28 in. Nowhere docs the maximum&nbsp;rainfall take place in winter (as in W. Europe), but it occurs in&nbsp;summer, and everywhere the months of advanced spring are warmer</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">than the corresponding months of autumn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though thus exhibiting the distinctive features of a continental climate, Russia does not lie altogether outside the reach of the&nbsp;moderating influence of the ocean. The Atlantic cyclones penetrate&nbsp;to the Russian plains, mitigating to some extent the cold of winter,&nbsp;and in summer bringing with them their moist winds and thunderstorms. Their influence is chiefly felt in W. Russia, though it does&nbsp;reach as far as the Urals and beyond. They thus check the extension&nbsp;and limit the duration of the cold anticyclones.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">Throughout Russia the winter is of long duration. The last days of frost arc experienced for the most part in April, but as late as May&nbsp;to the N. of 55° N. The spring is exceptionally beautiful in central&nbsp;Russia; late as it usually is, it sets in with vigour, and vegetation&nbsp;develops with a rapidity which gives to this season in Russia a&nbsp;special charm, unknown in warmer climates. The rapid melting of&nbsp;the snow at the same time causes the rivers to swell, and renders a&nbsp;great many minor streams navigable for a few weeks. But a return&nbsp;of cold weather, injurious to vegetation, is very frequently observed&nbsp;in central and E. Russia between May the 18th and the 24th, so&nbsp;that it is only in June that warm weather sets in definitely, and it&nbsp;reaches its maximum in the first half of July (or of August on the&nbsp;Black Sea coast).. In S.E. Russia the summer is much warmer than&nbsp;in the corresponding latitudes of France, and really hot weather is&nbsp;experienced everywhere. It does not, however, prevail for long,&nbsp;and in the first half of September frosts begin on the middle Urals.&nbsp;They descend upon W. and S. Russia in the beginning of October,&nbsp;and arc felt on the Caucasus about the middle of November. The&nbsp;temperature drops so rapidly that a month later, about October the&nbsp;10th on the middle Urals and November the 15th throughout Russia,&nbsp;the thermometer ceases to rise above the freezing-point. The&nbsp;rivers freeze rapidly; towards November 20th all tnc streams of&nbsp;the White Sea basin are ice-bound, and so remain for an average of&nbsp;167 days; those of the Baltic, Black Sea and Caspian basins freeze&nbsp;later, but about December the 20th nearly all the rivers of the&nbsp;country are highways for sledges. The Volga remains frozen for&nbsp;a period varying between 150 days in the N. ana 90 days at Astrakhan,&nbsp;the Don for 100 to no days, and the Dnieper for 83 to 122 days.&nbsp;On the W. Dvina ice prevents navigation for 125 days, and even the&nbsp;Vistula at Warsaw remains frozen for 77 days. The lowest temperatures are experienced in January, the average being as low as 20®&nbsp;to 5° Fahr, throughout Russia; in the west only does it rise above&nbsp;22®. On the whole, February and March continue to be cold, and&nbsp;their average temperatures rise above zero nowhere except on the&nbsp;Black Sea coast.. Even at Kiev and Lugansk the average of March&nbsp;is below 30°, while in central Russia it is 25° to 22°, and as low as&nbsp;20® and 16®. at Samara and Orenburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All Russia is comprised between the isotherms of 32® and 54°. On the whole, they are more remote from one another than even&nbsp;on the plains of J4. America, those of 46® to 32® being distributed&nbsp;over twenty degrees of latitude. They are, on the whole, inclined&nbsp;towards the S. in E. Russia; thus the isotherm of 39® runs from&nbsp;St Petersburg to Orenburg, and that of 35® from Tomcä in Finland&nbsp;to Uralsk. The inflexion is still greater for the winter isotherms.&nbsp;Closely following one another, they run almost N. and S.; thus&nbsp;Odessa and Königsberg are situated on the same winter isotherm&nbsp;of 28®; St Petersburg, Orel and the mouth of the Ural river on&nbsp;about 20®; and Mezen and Ufa on 9®. The summer isotherms cross&nbsp;the winter isotherms nearly at right angles, so that Kiev and Ufa,&nbsp;Warsaw and Tobolsk, Riga and the upper Kama have the same&nbsp;average summer temperatures of 64®, 62^® and 61® respectively.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The laws and relations of the cyclones and anti-cyclones in Russia are not yet thoroughly understood. It appears, however,&nbsp;that in January the cyclones mostly travel across N.W. Russia&nbsp;(N. of 55° and W. of 40® E.), following directions which vary&nbsp;between N.E. and S.E. In July they are pushed farther towards&nbsp;the N., and cross the Gulf of Bothnia, while another series of&nbsp;cyclones sweep across middle. Russia, between 50° and 55® N.&nbsp;Nor are the laws of the anti-cyclones established. The winds&nbsp;closely depend on the routes, followed by both. Generally, however, it may be said that alike in January, and in July W. and&nbsp;S.W. winds prevail in W. Russia, while E. winds arc most common&nbsp;in S.E. Russia. N. winds are predominant on the Black Sea coast.&nbsp;The strength of the wind is greater, on. the whole, than in the&nbsp;continental parts of W. Europe, and it attains its maximum velocity&nbsp;in winter. Terrible tempests blow from October to March, especially on the S. steppes ana on the tundras. Hurricanes accompanied&nbsp;with snow (&amp;M/ans, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">myatels),</span><span class="font0"> and lasting from two to three days,&nbsp;or N. blizzards without snow, are especially dangerous to man&nbsp;and beast. The average relative moisture reaches 80 to 85%&nbsp;in the N., and only 70 to 81 % in S. and E. Russia. In the steppes&nbsp;it is only 60% during summer, and still less (57) at Astrakhan.&nbsp;The average amount of cloud is </span><span class="font1">73 </span><span class="font0">to 75% on the White Sea and&nbsp;in Lithuania, 68 to 64 in central Russia, and only. 59 to 53 in the&nbsp;S. and S.E. The 'amount of rainfall is shown in the Table on&nbsp;next page.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The flora of Russia, which represents an intermediate link between the flora of Germany and the flora of Siberia, is strikingly uniform&nbsp;over a. very large area. Though not poor at any given&nbsp;place, it appears so if the space occupied by Russia be&nbsp;taken into account, only 3300 species of phanerogams and ferns</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
