<p><span class="font2">Basel and Mainz, the tributaries, though numerous, are mostly short and unimportant. The 111 and the Nahe on the left and the&nbsp;Neckar and the Main on the right are, however, notable exceptions.&nbsp;Before joining the Rhine the 111 runs almost parallel with it and&nbsp;at no great distance for upwards of 50 m. In the narrow part of&nbsp;the valley, between Bingen and Cologne, the Rhine receives the&nbsp;waters of the Lahn and the Sieg on the right, and those of the&nbsp;Mosel, bringing with it the Saar, and the Ahr on the left. Still&nbsp;lower down, but before the Dutch frontier is reached, come the&nbsp;Ruhr and the Lippe on the right, and the Erft on the left. The&nbsp;numerous arms into which the Rhine branches in Holland have&nbsp;already been noticed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Physical Geography.—</span><span class="font2">The Rhine connects the highest Alps with the mud banks of Holland, and touches in its course the most&nbsp;varied geological periods; but the river valley itself is, geologically&nbsp;speaking, of comparatively recent formation. Rising amid the&nbsp;ancient gneiss rocks of the St Gotthard, the Rhine finds its way&nbsp;down to the Lake of Constance between layers of Triassic and&nbsp;Jurassic formation; and between that lake and Basel it penetrates&nbsp;the chalk barrier of the Jura. The upper Rhenish valley is evidently&nbsp;the bed of an ancient lake, the shores of which were formed by&nbsp;the gneiss and granite of the Black Forest on the one side and the&nbsp;granite and sandstone of the Vosges on the other. Within the&nbsp;valley all the alluvial deposits are recent. Between Bingen and&nbsp;Bonn the Rhine forces its way through a hilly and rocky district&nbsp;belonging to the Devonian formation. The contorted strata of&nbsp;slate and greywacke rock must have been formed at a period vastly&nbsp;anterior to that in which the lake of the upper valley managed&nbsp;to force an outlet through the enclosing barriers. Probably this&nbsp;section may be looked upon as the oldest portion of the river course&nbsp;proper, connecting the upper Rhenish lake with the primeval&nbsp;ocean at Bonn, ln this district, too, as has already been remarked,&nbsp;is the finest scenery of the Rhine, a fact due in great part to the&nbsp;grotesque shapes of the quartzose rocks, left denuded of the less&nbsp;durable slate and sandstone. All the strata intersected by the&nbsp;Rhine between Bingen and Bonn contain fossils of the same classes.&nbsp;The deposits of the actual valley here, belonging to the Miocene&nbsp;group of the Tertiary system, are older than the deposits either&nbsp;tarther up or farther down the river; but they are contemporaneous with the basalts of the Rhine, w'hich at Coblenz and in the&nbsp;peaks of the Seven Mountains also contribute to the scenic charm&nbsp;of the river. The very extensive pumice deposits at Neuwied&nbsp;and the lava and other volcanic rocks belong to a more recent epoch.&nbsp;Below Bingen the formations belong almost entirely to the Post-Tertiaiy period. Numerous extinct volcanoes rise near Neuwied,&nbsp;ln the natter parts of the valley occur Jarge beds of loam and rubble,&nbsp;sometimes in terraces parallel with, but several hundred feet above,&nbsp;the river, proving by their disposition and appearance that the&nbsp;valley has been formed by the action of water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Navigation.—</span><span class="font2">The Rhine has been one of the chief waterways of Europe from the earliest times; and, as its channel is not exposed&nbsp;to the danger of silting up like those of the Elbe and the Oder,&nbsp;it has always been comparatively easy to keep it open* The&nbsp;Romans exerted themselves to improve the lower navigation of&nbsp;the river, and appointed prefects of the Rhine to superintend the&nbsp;shipping and to exact the moderate dues imposed to keep the&nbsp;channel in repair. Fhe Franks continued the same policy and&nbsp;retained a system of river-dues. Afterwards, as the banks became&nbsp;parcelled out among a host of petty princelings, each of whom&nbsp;arrogated the right </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font2">laying a tax on passing vessels, the imposts&nbsp;became so prejudicial as seriously to hamper the development of&nbsp;the shipping. —Many of the riparian potentates derived the bulk&nbsp;of their revenue from this source, and it is calculated that in the&nbsp;18th century the Rhine yielded a total revenue of £200,000, in spite&nbsp;of the comparatively insignificant amount of the shipping. The&nbsp;first proposal for a tree Rhine was mooted by the French at the&nbsp;congress of Rastatt (1797-1799), but Holland, commanding the&nbsp;mouth of the river, placed every obstacle in the way of the suggestion. ln 1831, on the separation of Holland and Belgium, the former&nbsp;had become more amenable to reason; and a system was agreed&nbsp;upon which practically gave free navigation to the vessels of the&nbsp;riverine states, while imposing a moderate tariff upon foreign ships.&nbsp;After the war of 1866, Prussia negotiated with Baden, Bavaria&nbsp;and Hesse-Darmstadt with a view' to the removal of all tolls.&nbsp;It was not, however, till 1868 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Rhein-Sckiffakrts Akte vom&nbsp;Ijten Okt., 1868)</span><span class="font2"> that the last vestige of a toll disappeared and the&nbsp;river was thrown open without any restriction. »The management&nbsp;of the channel and navigation is now vested in a central commission, meeting at Mannheim on the ist of July in each year. .The&nbsp;channel has been greatly improved and in many places made more&nbsp;direct since the beginning of the 19th century, large sums being&nbsp;annually spent in keeping it in order. Capacious river harbours&nbsp;have been formed at various points, twenty-nine of these being in&nbsp;Germany and eight in Holland. The position of the river is highly&nbsp;favourable for the development of its trade. It flows through the&nbsp;...cT; populous regions of the continent of Europe, to discharge&nbsp;into one of the most frequented seas opposite Great Britain, and,&nbsp;besides serving as a natural outlet for Germany, Belgium and&nbsp;Holland, is connected with a great part of central and southern</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">France by the Rhine-Rhone and the Rhine-Marne canals, and with the basin of the Danube by the Ludwugs-Canal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The introduction of steam has greatly increased the shipping on the Rhine; and small steamers nly also on the Main, the Neckar,&nbsp;the Maas and the Mosel. The first Rhine steamer was launched&nbsp;in 1817; and now the river is regularly traversed by upwards of a&nbsp;hundred, from the small tug up to the passenger saloon-steamer^&nbsp;The steamboat traffic has especially encouraged the influx of&nbsp;tourists, and the number of passing travellers may now be reckoned&nbsp;as between one and two millions annually. The river is navigable&nbsp;without interruption from Basel to its mouth, a distance of 550&nbsp;miles, of which 450 lie within Germany. Above Spires, however,&nbsp;the river craft are comparatively small, but lower down vessels of&nbsp;500 and 600 tons burden find no difficulty in plying. Between&nbsp;Basel and Strassburg the depth of w’atcr is sometimes not more&nbsp;than 3 ft.; between Strassburg and Mainz it varies from 5 to 25 ft.;&nbsp;while below Mainz it is never less than Q or 10 ft. The deepest&nbsp;point is opposite the Lorclei (Lurlei) Rock near St Goar, where it&nbsp;is 75 ft. in depth; at Düsseldorf the depth is about 50 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">London, Hamburg, Bremen and the chief Baltic ports as far as Riga and St Petersburg participate in the traffic on the Rhine.&nbsp;The boats which ply up and down the river itself, without venturing&nbsp;upon the open sea, are mostly craft of 100 to 200 tons, owned in&nbsp;the great majority of cases by their captains, men principally of&nbsp;German or Dutch nationality. This fleet is computed to number&nbsp;some 8500 craft, with an aggregate capacity of over 2 million tons,&nbsp;of which about one-tenth are steamships. The traffic at the chief&nbsp;German ports of the river aggregated 4,489,000 tons in 1870, but by&nbsp;1900 this had grown to a total of 17,000,000 tons, thus distributed :&nbsp;Ruhrort<sub>1</sub> 6,512,000 tons; Duisburg, 3,000,000 tons; Cologne,&nbsp;1,422,000 tons; and Mannheim, 6,021,000 tons. These are not&nbsp;the only ports on the river; a large trade is also done at Kchl,&nbsp;Maxau (for Karlsruhe), Ludwigshafcn, Mainz, Bonn, Rotterdam&nbsp;and a host of smaller places. The amount of traffic which passed&nbsp;the town of Emmerich near the Dutch frontier,.both ways, increased&nbsp;from an annual average of about 6 million tons in 1881-85 to over&nbsp;<sup>9 T</sup> rnijlion tops jn τ8^9- Notwithstanding the inherent difficulties of constructî3ïr-€aused by the great variations in the level&nbsp;of the stream, amounting sometimes to 20 ft. or more, the chief&nbsp;ports of the Rhine are admirably constructed, and well equipped&nbsp;with modern contrivances for loading and unloading vessels.&nbsp;Boats carrying as much as 600 tons «are often able to proceed as far&nbsp;up stream as Strassburg, and smaller craft get as far as Hüningen,&nbsp;a little above Basel. Large passenger boats ply regularly between&nbsp;Mainz and Düsseldorf, and sometimes extend their journeys as high&nbsp;up as Mannheim, and as far in the other direction as Rotterdam.&nbsp;The efforts of the river authorities are being directed to the deepening and improvement of the navigable channel from the sea to&nbsp;Strassburg, the low-water depths aimed at being 10 ft. from&nbsp;Rotterdam to the German frontier, and 10 ft. thence to Cologne;&nbsp;8 ft. 3 in. from Cologne to St Goar, and 6 ft. 6 in. from St Goar&nbsp;to Mannheim. At present the Rhine in Holland has a depth of&nbsp;about 9 ft. and a width of 1200 to 1300 ft., though the Merwede&nbsp;branch exceeds this depth by 8 in. Altogether a sum approaching&nbsp;£2,500,000 was spent in Holland w’ithin the latter part of the 19th&nbsp;century on the improvement of the Rhine and its principal arteries.&nbsp;Above Mannheim the depth of the stream is always less than 5 ft.,&nbsp;and generally varies bctw<sup>r</sup>een that figure and 4 ft. 6 in. The&nbsp;difficulty of ascending the rapids near Bingen is usually surmounted&nbsp;by the help of steam hauling machinery placed on the bank,&nbsp;though powerful tugs have also come into use for this purpose.&nbsp;The work of blasting out the rocks which at that spot projected&nbsp;in the bed of the river, begun in 1830, was continued down to the&nbsp;year 1887, so that now there arc two navigable channels of sufficient&nbsp;depth for all vessels which ply up and down that part of the stream.&nbsp;One of the most interesting features of the Rnine navigation is&nbsp;afforded by the huge rafts of timber that are floated down the river.&nbsp;Single tree trunks sent down to the Rhine by the various tributaries&nbsp;are united into small rafts as they reach the main stream; and&nbsp;these again are fastened together to form one large raft about&nbsp;Andernach. Though not so large as formerly, these timber rafts&nbsp;are still sometimes 400 or 500 ft. in length, and are navigated by&nbsp;200 to 400 men, who live in little huts on the raft, forming actual&nbsp;floating villages. On reaching Dort the rafts are broken up and&nbsp;sold, a single raft sometimes producing as much as £30,000. The&nbsp;voyage from Bingen to Dort takes from one to six w<sup>r</sup>eeks, and the&nbsp;huge unwieldy structures require to be navigated with great care.&nbsp;The commerce carried on by the river itself is supplemented by&nbsp;the numerous railways, which skirt its banks and converge to its&nbsp;principal towns. Before the introduction of railways there were&nbsp;no permanent bridges across the Rhine below Basel; but now&nbsp;trains cross it at about a dozen different points in Germany and&nbsp;Holland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font0">Politically the Rhine has always played a great part. The wholt valley seems to have been originally occupied&nbsp;by Celtic tribes, who have left traces of their presence on the&nbsp;contents of tombs and in the forms of names (Moguntiaeum</span></p>
