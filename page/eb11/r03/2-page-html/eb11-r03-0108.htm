<p><span class="font0">at Carlisle, the younger Robert joined Sir William Wallace, who raised the standard of Scottish independence in the name&nbsp;of Baliol after that king had surrendered his kingdom to Edward&nbsp;in 1296. Urgent letters were sent ordering Bruce to support&nbsp;John de Warenne, earl of Surrey, Edward’s general, in the&nbsp;summer of 1297; but, instead of complying, he assisted to&nbsp;lay waste the lands of those who adhered to Edward. On&nbsp;the 7th of July Bruce and his friends were forced to make&nbsp;terms by a treaty called the capitulation of Irvine. The&nbsp;Scottish lords were not to serve beyond the sea against their&nbsp;will, and were pardoned for their recent violence, in return&nbsp;owning allegiance to Edward. The bishop of Glasgow, James&nbsp;the steward, and Sir Alexander Lindesay became sureties for&nbsp;Bruce until he delivered his daughter Marjorie as a hostage.&nbsp;Wallace almost alone maintained the struggle for freedom&nbsp;which the nobles, as well as Baliol, had given up, and Bruce&nbsp;had no part in the honour of Stirling Bridge in September 1297,&nbsp;or the reverse of Falkirk, where in July 1298 Edward in person&nbsp;recovered what his generals had lost, and drove Wallace into&nbsp;exile. Shortly afterwards Bruce appears again to have sided&nbsp;with his countrymen; Annandale was wasted, while he, as&nbsp;Walter of Hemingford says, “when he heard of the king’s&nbsp;coming, fled from his face and burnt the castle of Ayr which&nbsp;he held.” Yet, when Edward was forced by home affairs&nbsp;to quit Scotland, Annandale and certain earldoms, including&nbsp;Carrick, were excepted from the districts he assigned to his&nbsp;followers, Bruce and other earls being treated as waverers&nbsp;whose allegiance might still be retained. About 1299 a regency&nbsp;was appointed in Scotland in the name of Baliol, and a letter&nbsp;of Baliol mentions Robert Bruce, lord of Carrick, as regent,&nbsp;along with William of Lamberton, bishop of St Andrews, and&nbsp;John Comyn the younger, a strange combination—Lamberton&nbsp;the friend of Wallace, Comyn the enemy of Bruce, and Bruce&nbsp;a regent in name of BalioL Comyn in his own interest as&nbsp;BalioFs nephew and heir was the active regent; the insertion&nbsp;of the name of Bruce was an attempt to secure his co-operation.&nbsp;For the next four years he kept studiously in the background,&nbsp;waiting his time. A statement of Peter Langtoft that he&nbsp;was at the parliament of Lincoln in 1301, when the English&nbsp;barons repudiated the claim of Pope Boniface VIII. to the&nbsp;suzerainty of Scotland, is not to be credited, though his father&nbsp;may have been there. In the campaign of 1304, when Edward&nbsp;renewed his attempt on Scotland and reduced Stirling, Bruce&nbsp;supported the English king, who in one of his letters to him&nbsp;says, “ If you complete that which you have begun, we shall&nbsp;hold the war ended by your deed and all the land of Scotland&nbsp;gained.” But, while apparently aiding Edward, Bruce had&nbsp;taken a step which bound him to the patriotic cause. On&nbsp;the nth of June, five weeks before the fall of Stirling, he met&nbsp;Lamberton at Cambuskenneth and entered into a secret bond&nbsp;by which they were to support each other against all adversaries&nbsp;and undertake nothing without consulting together. The&nbsp;death of his father in 1304 may have determined his course,&nbsp;and led him to prefer the chance of the Scottish crown to his&nbsp;English estates and the friendship of Edward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This determination closes the first chapter of his life; the second, from 1304 to 1314, is occupied by his contest for the&nbsp;kingdom, which was really won at Bannockburn, though&nbsp;disputed until the treaty of Northampton in 1328; the last,&nbsp;from 1314 to his death in 1329, was the period of the establishment of his government and dynasty by an administration&nbsp;as skilful as his generalship. It is to the second of these that&nbsp;historians, attracted by its brilliancy even amongst the many&nbsp;romances of history and its importance to Scottish history,&nbsp;have directed most of their attention, and it is during it that&nbsp;his personal character, tried by adversity and prosperity,&nbsp;gradually unfolds itself. But all three periods require to be&nbsp;kept in view to form a just estimate of Bruce. That which&nbsp;terminated in 1304, though unfortunately few characteristics,&nbsp;personal or individual, have been preserved, shows him by his&nbsp;conduct to have been the normal Scottish noble of the time.&nbsp;A conflict of interest and of bias led to contradictory action,&nbsp;and this conflict was increased in his case by his father’s residence in England, his own upbringing at the English court,&nbsp;his family feud with Baliol and the Cornyns, and the jealousy&nbsp;common to his class of Wallace, the mere knight, who had&nbsp;rallied the commons against the invader and taught the nobles&nbsp;what was required in a leader of the people. The merit of&nbsp;Bruce is that he did not despise the lesson. Prompted alike&nbsp;by patriotism and ambition, at the prime of manhood he chose&nbsp;the cause of national independence with all its perils, and stood&nbsp;by it with an unwavering constancy until he secured its triumph.&nbsp;Though it is crowded with incident, the main facts in the&nbsp;central decade of Bruce’s life may be rapidly told. The fall&nbsp;of Stirling was followed by the capture and execution of Wallace&nbsp;in London in August 1305. Edward hoped still to conciliate&nbsp;the nobles and gain Scotland by a policy of clemency to all who&nbsp;did not dispute his authority. A parliament in London in&nbsp;September 1305 to which Scottish representatives were summoned, agreed to an ordinance for the government of Scotland,&nbsp;which, though on the model of those for Wales and Ireland,&nbsp;treating Scotland as a third subject province under an English&nbsp;lieutenant, was in other respects not severe. Bruce is reputed&nbsp;to have been one of the advisers who assisted in framing it;&nbsp;but a provision that his castle of Kildrummy was to be placed&nbsp;in charge of a person for whom he should answer shows that&nbsp;Edward, not without reason, suspected his fidelity. The&nbsp;details of his final breach with the English king are somewhat&nbsp;obscure. According to one account, the bond between Bruce&nbsp;and Lamberton was revealed to Edward by Comyn while&nbsp;Bruce was at the English court. Alarmed by a hint dropped&nbsp;by Edward, he left England secretly, and in the church of the&nbsp;Friars Minorite at Dumfries on the 10th of February 1306 met&nbsp;Cornyn, whom he slew before the high altar for refusing to join&nbsp;in his plans. So much is certain, though the precise incidents&nbsp;of the interview are variously told. It was not their first&nbsp;encounter, for a letter of 1299 to Edward from Scotland&nbsp;describes Comyn as having seized Bruce by the throat at a&nbsp;meeting at Peebles, where they were with difficulty reconciled&nbsp;by the regents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The bond with Lamberton was now sealed by blood, and the confederates lost no time in putting it into execution. Within&nbsp;little more than six weeks Bruce, collecting his adherents in&nbsp;the south-west, passed from Lochmaben to Glasgow and thence&nbsp;to Scone, where he was crowned king of Scotland on the 27th&nbsp;of March 1306. Two days later Isabella, countess of Buchan,&nbsp;claimed the right of her family, the Macduffs, earls of Fife,&nbsp;to place the Scottish king on his throne, and the ceremony&nbsp;was repeated with an addition flattering to the Celtic race.&nbsp;Though a king, Bruce had not yet a kingdom, and his efforts&nbsp;to obtain it were disastrous failures until after the death of&nbsp;Edward I. In June 1306 he was defeated at Methven, and&nbsp;on the nth of August he was surprised in Strathfillan, where&nbsp;he had taken refuge. The ladies of his family were sent to&nbsp;Kildrummy in January 1307, and Bruce, almost without a&nbsp;follower, fled to the island of Rathlin. Edward came to the&nbsp;north in the following spring On his way he granted the&nbsp;Scottish estates of Bruce and his adherents to his own followers,&nbsp;Annandale falling to Humphrey de Bohun, 4th earl of Hereford. At Carlisle there was published a bull excommunicating&nbsp;Bruce; and Elizabeth his wife, Marjorie his daughter, and&nbsp;Christina his sister, were captured in a sanctuary at Tain,&nbsp;while three of his brothers were executed. In a moment all&nbsp;was changed by the death of Edward I. on the 7th of July&nbsp;1307. Instead of being opposed to the greatest, Bruce had&nbsp;now as his antagonist the feeblest of the Plantagenets. Quitting&nbsp;Rathlin, he had made a short stay in Arran, and before, Edward’s&nbsp;death had failed to Take Ayr and Turnberry, although he defeated Aymer de Valence, earl of Pembroke, at Loudoun Hill&nbsp;in May 1306. After wasting the critical moment of the war in&nbsp;the diversions of court life, the new English king, Edward II.,&nbsp;made an inglorious march to Cumnock and back without&nbsp;striking a blow; and then returned south, leaving the war to&nbsp;a succession of generals.
