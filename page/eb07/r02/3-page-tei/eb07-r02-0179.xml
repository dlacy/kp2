Behind the altars which crowd the principal recesses, are placed on shelves the busts of the most distinguished men of modern Italy. The pavement, which is supposed to be the work of Septimius Severus, is composed of porphyry and yellow marble, and of pavonazzetto, laid down in large slabs, alternately round and square. The splendid dome which rises over the whole is still uninjured.</p><p>A large circular aperture at the top, surrounded with a girth of metal, admits a flood of light sufficient to illuminate the whole building. The remains of Raphael are interred in the Pantheon, together with many of those whose names reflected lustre on modern Italy in her proudest days. The situation of the Pantheon is extremely unfavourable. It is sunk in the dirtiest part of modem Rome. The congregated filth of the pavement, the incessant uproar, and the crowds of clamorous beggars, tend materially to lessen the enthusiasm with which the spectator gazes upon this monument of the taste and magnificence of antiquity. Yet in spite of all this, and of the dilapidations which it has suffered from the lapse of eighteen centuries, and the rapacity of barbarians, still, under every disadvantage, it is pre-eminently beautiful. “ The pure and perfect architecture, the greatness of design, the harmony, the simplicity, and the imposing majesty of the whole, command our never satiated admiration, our approbation, and our praise.” “ Though plundered of all its brass, except the ring which preserves the aperture above ; though it has been twice the prey of fire ; though it is always open to the rain, and is sometimes flooded by the river, yet no monument of equal antiquity is so well preserved as this rotondo.”@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p><p>Near the Tiber there is a beautiful little temple, popularly called the temple of Vesta, though no satisfactory reason can be given for the designation. Its form and elegance have been much admired ; and bronze models of the “ little temple of Vesta” are dispersed over most of Europe. It is entirely built of Parian marble, and its portico is composed of a circular colonnade of twenty fluted Corinthian columns. Of these only one is wanting ; but all the architrave is lost. The small circular cell within the colonnade is now converted into a chapel, dedicated to “ La Madonna dell’ Sole,” (the virgin of the sun.)</p><p>Opposite to this beautiful building, stands the church of St. Maria in Cosmedin, built by Adrian I. on the ruins of an ancient temple, the name of which is unknown. It appears, like the Pantheon, to have eight columns, and fifteen at the sides. Six of the front columns of the most beautiful Parian marble may still be traced, built up into this hideous compound of deformity and bad taste. The church of S. Maria Egizziaca has been formed out of another ancient temple, which is usually called by the name of Fortuna Virilis. On that ruin-covered spot, which now bears the name of the Roman Forum, but without its ancient limits, stands the temple of Antoninus and Faustina. It is a fine specimen of ancient architecture. Its noble portico, which, though entire, has evidently suffered from fire, is composed of six Corinthian columns of Cippol-lino marble in front, and two on each side. The exquisite chiseling of the friese and cornice, tlle sculptured griffins, candelabros, vases, &amp;c. which form the ornaments, are scarcely equalled in any Roman monument of the kind in existence. A little farther on is the church of the saints Cosmo and Damiano, supposed to be the double temple of Romulus and Remus. Near the Coliseum are the remains</p><lb/><p>of Hadrian’s magnificent temple of Venus and Rome.@@<hi rend="sup">2 </hi>Some striking ruins of the interior of the fabric still exist in the middle of the site. Pope Honorius I. covered the whole of St. Peter’s basilica with bronze tablets which he took from the roof of this temple.</p><p>Many other ruins of the magnificent temples of ancient Rome are scattered throughout the city, but their remains are so scanty that it is impossible to obtain any information respecting their origin or extent.</p><p>Various temporary theatres seem to have been erected at different times in Rome, but the first that was built of stable materials in this city was the theatre of Pompey. It was rebuilt by Tiberius, and again by Claudius, but there is not a single vestige of it now remaining. The theatre of Marcellus was built by Augustus, who named it after his nephew, whose death has been commemorated by Virgil in such pathetic strains.@@<hi rend="sup">3</hi> Of this once magnificent edifice nothing now remains except a very small portion of the two lower arcades, which are considered models of architecture.</p><p>Ancient Rome possessed a number of noble porticos, but all that now remains of these is a fragment of the portico of Octavio. It originally consisted of a double line of marble columns covered width a roof, so as to afford shelter to those who walked within it. In the open square stood the temples of Jupiter and Juno, the first in Rome that were built of marble. Here were exhibited many splendid paintings and statues ; and this portico contained one of the three public libraries which Rome possessed in the Augustan age. The only remains of this magnificent building are four Corinthian columns, and three pilasters of beautiful marble, with a part of the ancient pediment. They stand in what a modem traveller has pronounced tlle “ filthiest spot upon the whole face of the globe—the pescheria or fishmarket, the crowded quarter where the Jews are condemned to reside.”</p><p>It has been justly said that no monument of ancient architecture is calculated to inspire such an exalted idea of Roman magnificence, as the ruins of their thermæ, or baths. These magnificent structures were not, however, erected for bathing alone ; but in them there were rooms for almost every kind of athletic exercises ; walks shaded by rows of trees ; fountains adorned with statues and precious marbles ; libraries ; spacious halls and vestibules decorated with the finest objects of art, where poets recited, orators declaimed, and philosophers lectured. A splendid description has been given by Pliny of the sculptures and paintings, the magnificent seats of solid silver, the silver pipes and baths, the polished vases, the pavements of precious stones, and all the sumptuous decorations of these magnificent buildings dedicated to the luxury and idleness of the Romans.@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi> The thermae of ancient Rome are known to have stood in all their original magnificence so late as the fourth century, and their destruction seems to have been almost entirely owing to the rapacity of the modern Romans. Of all the thermae that adorned imperial Rome, the ruins of those of Titus, Diocletian, and Caracalla, are all that now remain in any considerable degree of preservation. The thermae of Caracalla are situated at the base of Mount Aventine, on the Via Appia. They were left incomplete by Caracalla, and were finished by Heliogabalus, and by Alexander Severus.@@<hi rend="sup">5</hi> These baths, together with the outworks, were one mile in circumference, and their ruins still cover a vast extent of ground ; but it is impossible to form from them any idea of the peculiar destination of the particular parts.
