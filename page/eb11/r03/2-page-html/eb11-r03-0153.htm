<p><span class="font1">on University Avenue in the eastern part of the city. With it is connected the Ward Museum, containing the valuable&nbsp;geological and zoological collections of Henry Augustus Ward&nbsp;(1834-1906), an American naturalist, professor of natural&nbsp;sciences here in 1860-75, who had in Rochester a laboratory&nbsp;for the manufacture of plaster-casts of fossils, and who prepared natural history cabinets for many museums. Much&nbsp;of the success of the university was due to Martin Brewer&nbsp;Anderson (1815-1890), president from 1853 to 1888, and David&nbsp;Jayne Hill (b. 1850), who was president from 1888 to 1896,&nbsp;and subsequently was assistant secretary of state in 1898-1903,&nbsp;and minister to Switzerland in 1903-5 and to the Netherlands&nbsp;from 1905 to 1907, when he became ambassador to Germany.&nbsp;Rochester Theological Seminary (1850) is also under the control&nbsp;of the Baptist Church, but has no organic connexion with the&nbsp;university of Rochester. Its library of 36,500 volumes includes the valuable collection (6500 vols.) of the German church&nbsp;historian, Johann August Wilhelm Neander. Other educational&nbsp;institutions include St Bernard's Theological Seminary (Roman&nbsp;Catholic; 1893); Wagner Memorial Lutheran College (German);&nbsp;Academy of the Sacred Heart (Roman Catholic), &amp;c. One of,&nbsp;Rochester’s most noteworthy institutions is the Athenaeum&nbsp;and Mechanics’ Institute (an outgrowth of the Rochester&nbsp;Athenaeum, established in 1829); it was founded in 1885&nbsp;by Henry Lomb, of the Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co., and has&nbsp;a large building, the gift of George Eastman (b. 1854), of the&nbsp;Eastman Kodak Co. It has an endowment of $650,000, and&nbsp;more than 60 instructors, and in 1907-8 more than 5000&nbsp;students were enrolled. Since 1907 public school buildings&nbsp;have been used as club-houses for community civic clubs with&nbsp;libraries and gymnasiums; and in 1909 a League of Civic&nbsp;Clubs was organized. Besides the law library and the libraries&nbsp;of the educational institutions mentioned above, Rochester&nbsp;has the Reynolds (Public) Library, containing more than&nbsp;65,000 volumes in 1910.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Falls of the Genesee provide a valuable water-power, early utilized by the flour-inilling industry, of which, owing largely to&nbsp;the nearness of the fertile wheat-fields of the Genesee VaIIcy and the&nbsp;transportation facilities furnished by the Erie Canal and Lake&nbsp;Ontario, as well as to the water-power, Rochester was for many&nbsp;years the most important centre in the country. Flour-milling&nbsp;is no longer so important an industry here, but Rochester ranks&nbsp;high among the great manufacturing cities of the country, holding&nbsp;third rank in this as in population in New York state, and is remarkable for the great size and output of several of its manufacturing&nbsp;plants, which are the largest of their sort in the United States or&nbsp;the world. In 1905 the value of the city’s factory products was&nbsp;$82,747,370, an increase of 38-7% since 1900. In value of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">f</span><span class="font1">iroduct and in number of wage-earners employed the manu-acture of men’s clothing stood first; the value of the product was $14,948,703, or more than 18 % of the total value of all the&nbsp;city’s manufactures; and 20% of the factory wage-earners in the&nbsp;city were employed in this industry. The second industry in 1905&nbsp;was the making of boots and shoes, of which the value was $8,620,011,&nbsp;an increase of 24-3% since 1900. In the value of clothing and&nbsp;in the value of boots and shoes manufactured Rochester ranked&nbsp;seventh among the cities of the United States in 1905. In the&nbsp;manufacture of photographic apparatus and materials and optical&nbsp;goods Rochester easily holds first place in the world, and it has the&nbsp;largest establishment for the manufacture of cameras (the Eastman&nbsp;Kodak Co. at Kodak Park) and the largest manufactory of lenses,&nbsp;telescopes, opera and field glasses (Bausch &amp; Lomb Optical Co.).&nbsp;I he total value of the photographic apparatus in 1905 was $2,886,071 »&nbsp;which represented 82*9% of the product value of photographic&nbsp;apparatus manufactured in the entire United States, and was 176*1 %&nbsp;more than in 1900. Photographic materials amounted in value&nbsp;to $4,528,582, 47*4% of the total value of the product of the&nbsp;country. The value of the output of this industry was 2100%&nbsp;more in 1905 than in 1900. Another remarkable increase was&nbsp;shown in the value of electrical machinery and apparatus, which&nbsp;was only $15,000 in 1900, but in 1905 was $2,078,360. Flour&nbsp;and grist mill products in 1905 were valued at $3,222,257. In&nbsp;Rochester is an immense refinery of lubricating oil, and the oil&nbsp;product more than doubled in value between 1900 and 1905. Other&nbsp;important manufactures, with the value of their product in 1905,&nbsp;arc as follows: foundry and machine-shop products, $2,874,142;&nbsp;furniture, $2,364,859; tobacco, cigars, snuff, &amp;c., $2,234,531;&nbsp;malt liquors, $2,173,707; confectionery, $1,512,611; lumber and&nbsp;planing mill products, $1,495,229; carriages and wagons, $1,229,570;&nbsp;and stationery goods, $1,130,873. Rochester is also the nurserygardening centre of the United States. The first nursery, that of&nbsp;Ellwanger &amp; Barry, now one of the largest in the world, was established here in 1840. There arc now more than a score of large&nbsp;nurseries, representing an investment of several millions of dollars,&nbsp;and annually shipping seeds, bulbs and plants having an approximate value of $2,000,000. Rochester is the port of entry for the&nbsp;Gcnesee customs-district, importing Canadian lumber and wheat&nbsp;and exporting dairy, garden, farm and orchard products. In 1909&nbsp;its imports were valued at $1,809,746 and its exports at $1,360,367.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The government of Rochester is that of cities of the first class (the state census of 1905 showed that it had more than the 175,000&nbsp;inhabitants necessary for a city of the first class under the New York&nbsp;state law). The city owns its water supply system, the supply being&nbsp;obtained largely from Hemlock Lake, 30 m. S. of the city limits.&nbsp;The value of the plant is approximately $8,000,000. Rochester is&nbsp;famous for the purity of its milk supply, which is regulated under&nbsp;a strict system of supervision and inspection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The region about Rochester, when first visited by Europeans, was the home of the Sencca Indians. The Jesuits, Peter&nbsp;Joseph Marie Chaumonot (1611-1693) and Jacques Fremin&nbsp;(d. 1691), worked among the Indians in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;In 1687 the marquis dc Denonville fought a battle with the&nbsp;Iroquois near the falls. In 1710 there was a French post on&nbsp;Irondequoit Bay. The district was included in the Phelps-Gorham Purchase in 1788. It was not until Ebenezer Allan&nbsp;(called “ Indian Allan ”) built a saw and grist mill at the falls&nbsp;in 1790 that a small settlement began to grow up. In 1802 a&nbsp;large tract of land, which included the site of the present city,&nbsp;passed into the hands of three Maryland proprietors, Charles&nbsp;Carroll, William Fitzhugh, and Nathaniel Rochester (1752-1831).&nbsp;Rochester, from whom the city took its name, was a native of&nbsp;Virginia, had been a manufacturer at Hagerstown, Maryland,&nbsp;and after settling in Rochester in r8i8 was a member in 1822&nbsp;of the New York Assembly. He established a settlement,&nbsp;largely of New Englanders, at the falls in 1810-12, but its&nbsp;growth was slow as it was not on the direct road between Albany&nbsp;and Buffalo, and the region was malarial. It was known&nbsp;at first as “ The Falls ” or “ Falls Town.” In 1817 it was&nbsp;incorporated as the village of Rochesterville, the name being&nbsp;shortened to its present form two years later. In 1820 it had&nbsp;only 1502 inhabitants. In 1821 Monroe county was erected&nbsp;with Rochester as the county-seat. The real growth of the&nbsp;place began with the completion of the Rochester and Lock-port section of the Erie Canal in 1823, and in two years the&nbsp;population had about doubled. Rochester was first chartered&nbsp;as a city in 1834, with 12,000 inhabitants. Rochester’s first&nbsp;newspaper, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette,</span><span class="font1"> was established in 1816, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Telegraph&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">following in 1818. The first daily newspaper was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Daily&nbsp;Advertiser</span><span class="font1"> (1826). Between 1828 and 1830 Rochester was the&nbsp;centre of the anti-Masonic political movement, and here&nbsp;Thurlow Weed published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anti-Masonie Enquirer.</span><span class="font1"> Subsequently it was a centre of the abolitionist movement in&nbsp;New York state; Myron Holley (1779-1841) began here the&nbsp;publication of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freeman</span><span class="font1"> in 1839, and in 1847 Frederick&nbsp;Douglass established the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">North Star.</span><span class="font1"> For many years before&nbsp;the Civil War it was a busy station of the “ Underground&nbsp;Railroad,” by which fugitive slaves were assisted in escaping&nbsp;to Canada. In 1846 Miss Susan B. Anthony settled in&nbsp;Rochester, and the city has been a gathering-place for advocates of women’s rights. Here lived the Fox sisters, Margaret&nbsp;(1836-1893) and Katharine (b. 1839), whose spiritualistic demonstrations became notorious about 1850 as the “ Rochester&nbsp;Rappings,” and the city has been a gathering-place for American&nbsp;spiritualists also. The narrowness of the gorge through which&nbsp;the Genesee river runs has always rendered the city liable to&nbsp;disastrous floods. Several of these in its early history practically destroyed the manufacturing industries along the river, but&nbsp;the loss of property in the more recent ones has been relatively&nbsp;less; that of 1865 entailed a loss of more than $1,000,000, and in&nbsp;that of 1902 the damage exceeded $1,500,000.</span></p>
