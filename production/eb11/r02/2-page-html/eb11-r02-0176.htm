<p><span class="font3">in the progress of events ever new illustrations of the working of the great principles which are revealed. And ... it will&nbsp;gladly accept all that research and discovery can yield for the&nbsp;better understanding of the conditions under which the book&nbsp;was written.” The chief value of this very scholarly book is&nbsp;to be found in its textual side.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The greater number of the methods discussed above have made no permanent contribution to the exegesis of Revelation;&nbsp;the method among them that has done most in this direction&nbsp;is the contemporary-historical. But, though this method has&nbsp;been applied in its fullness, and that by the keenest exegetes,&nbsp;there remains a consciousness that it has failed to solve many&nbsp;of the problems of the book. In many important points,&nbsp;however, its upholders are agreed, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font3"> that the book is directed&nbsp;against Rome, that Nero </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">redivivus</span><span class="font3"> is to be recognized in the&nbsp;wounded head, that the number 666 denotes Nero Caesar, and&nbsp;that in chap. xi. the preservation of the temple is foretold.&nbsp;Consequently the date of the composition of the book is placed&nbsp;before </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 70. Against the date assigned to the opening&nbsp;verses of this chapter modern scholars can make no objection,&nbsp;but, if this be the date of the entire work, then many passages&nbsp;in it are hopelessly inexplicable; for the latter just as certainly&nbsp;demand a date subsequent to </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 70 as xi. 1-2, a date prior to&nbsp;it. If, therefore, the possibilities of exegesis were exhausted in&nbsp;the list of methods already enumerated, science would have&nbsp;,to put the New Testament Apocalypse aside as a hopeless&nbsp;enigma. But there is no such </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">impasse.</span><span class="font3"> For in the New&nbsp;Testament Apocalypse there is not that rigid consistency and&nbsp;unity in detail that the past presupposed. The critical studies&nbsp;of recent years have shown that most of the Old Testament&nbsp;prophetical books are composite. And this holds true in no&nbsp;less a degree of most of thc Jewish apocalypses. Such works&nbsp;are to be explained on what might be called the &quot; fragmentary&nbsp;hypothesis.” Other books, like the Ethiopic Enoch, exhibit a&nbsp;series of independent sources connected more or less loosely&nbsp;together. Such are to be explained on the &quot; sources hypothesis.” Others, like the Ascension of Isaiah, betray the handiwork of successive editors, and are accordingly to be explained&nbsp;on the &quot; redaction hypothesis.” Now modern scholars have&nbsp;with varying success used in turn these three hypotheses with&nbsp;a view to the solution of the problems of the New Testament&nbsp;Apocalypse. To these we shall now address ourselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">II. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Methods—Literary-Critical—presupposing some Degree of Compositeness in the Book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">i. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Redaction Hypothesis.—</span><span class="font3">Suggestions, as we have already&nbsp;observed, had been made in this direction, but it was not till&nbsp;Weizsäcker </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Theol. Littcroturzeitung,</span><span class="font3"> 1882, p. 78 seq.) reopened&nbsp;the question that the problem was seriously undertaken. In&nbsp;the same year his pupil Volter </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Entstehung der Apok.,</span><span class="font3"> 1882,&nbsp;1885) put forward the bold theory that the original Apocalypse&nbsp;consisted of i. 4-6, iv. i-v. 10, vi. 1-17, vii. 1-8, viii. 1-13,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ix. 1-21, xi. 14-19, xiv. 1-3, 6, 7, xiv. 14-20, xviii. 1-24, xix.. 1-4,&nbsp;xix. s-ioa, which he assigned to the year </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 66 (so the second&nbsp;edition). To this the original author added as an appendix x.&nbsp;i-xi. 13, xiv. 8, xvii. 1-18, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 68-70. The work underwent three later redactions at the hands of successive editors&nbsp;in the reigns of Trajan and Hadrian. Instead of the above&nbsp;complex theory this writer now offers another </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Offenbarung&nbsp;Johannis,</span><span class="font3"> 1904),@@<sup>1</sup> in which he distinguishes an apocalypse of&nbsp;John, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 65, i. 4-6, iv. i-v. 10, vi. i-vii. 8, viii.-ix., xi. 14-19,&nbsp;xiv. 1-3, 6-7, xiv. 14-20, xviii. i-xix. 4, xix. 5-10 (pp. 3-56),&nbsp;an apocalypse of Cerinthus </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 70, x. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ι-ii,</span><span class="font3"> xvii. 1-18, xi. 1-13,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">xii. 1-16, xv. 5-6, 8, xvi. 1-21, xix. n-xxi. 8, xxi. 9-xxii. 6&nbsp;(pp. 56-129), a redaction of the work in </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 114-15, i. 7<sup>_8</sup>&gt;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">V. </span><span class="font3">6b, 11-14, vii. 9-17, xii. n, i8-xiii. 18, xiv. 4-5, 9-12, xv.&nbsp;1-4, 7, xvi. 19b, xvii. 14, 16, 17, xxi. 14, 22-27, xxii. 1-2, 8-9&nbsp;(pp. 129-48), and certain additions, i. 1-3, 9-iii. 22, xiv. 13,&nbsp;xvi. 15, xxii. 7, 10-20, made in the time of Hadrian (pp. 148-171).&nbsp;First of all it should be observed that Vôltèr was the first to&nbsp;call attention to the radical difference in outlook betwcen&nbsp;vii. 1-8 and vii. 9-17—a difference now generally recognized.&nbsp;Next it is noteworthy that in the second scheme here given&nbsp;Volter has abandoned his theory of a redaction hypothesis&nbsp;in favour of a sources hypothesis+a redactor. The earlier view&nbsp;of Volter was rejected on every side: the later will not prove&nbsp;more acceptable, though individual suggestions of this scholar&nbsp;will be occasionally helpful. The problem was next dealt&nbsp;with by Vischer </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Offenbarung Johannis, eine Jüdische&nbsp;Apokalypse in Christlicher Bearbeitung,</span><span class="font3"> 1886, 2nd ed., 1895),&nbsp;who took iv. i-xxii. 5 to be a Jewish apocalypse revised and&nbsp;edited by a Christian, to whom he assigned i.-iii., v. 9-14, vii.&nbsp;9-17, xi. 8b, xii. 11, xiii. 9, 10, xiv. 1-5, 12, 13, xvi. 15, xvii.&nbsp;14, xix. 9, 10, 13b, xx. 4b~5a, 6, xxi. 5b-8, 14b, xxii. 6-21,&nbsp;together with some isolated expressions and all references to&nbsp;the Lamb. This scheme met with a better reception than that&nbsp;of Volter, but it also has failed to solve the problem. In 1891&nbsp;Erbes </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Offenbarung Johannis,</span><span class="font3"> 1891) maintained that the book&nbsp;was entirely of Christian origin. The groundwork was written&nbsp;about </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 62. In this an editor incorporated a Caligula&nbsp;apocalypse, and a subsequent editor revised the existing work&nbsp;in many passages and made considerable additions, especially&nbsp;in the later chapters. Another attempt, mainly from this&nbsp;standpoint, has recently been made by J. Weiss of Marburg&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Offenbarung des Johannis,</span><span class="font3"> 1904). This writer seeks to establish the existence of an original Christian apocalypse written&nbsp;before </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 60. This included (see p. m) i. 4-6 (7, 8), 9-19,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">@@@<sup>1</sup> Besides the works mentioned here Volter wrote two other works on the Apocalypse: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Die Offenbarung Johannis,</span><span class="font2"> 1886; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Das Problem&nbsp;der Apokalypse,</span><span class="font2"> 1893.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font3">ii.-vii., ix., xii. 7-12, xiii. 11-18, xiv. 1-5, 14-20, xx. 1-15, xxi. 1-4, xxii. 3-5, 8 sqq. With this a Jewish apocalypse (x.-xi. 13,&nbsp;xii. 1-6, 14-17, xiü. 1-7, xv.-xix., xxi. 9-27—see p. 115), written&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 70, was incorporated by the redactor. This latter apocalypse&nbsp;consisted of a series of independent prophecies which appeared&nbsp;to have thc same crisis in view. This redactor, moreover, was&nbsp;the first who gave to the Apocalypse the character of an attack&nbsp;on the Roman Empire and the imperial cult by means of a&nbsp;series of small additions. In the above work we have a combination of the redaction and sources hypotheses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Sources Hypothesis.—</span><span class="font3">The same year Weyland </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Theol.&nbsp;Tijdsch.,</span><span class="font3"> 1886, 454-70; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Omwcrkings en Compilatie-Hypothesen&nbsp;toegepast op de Apoc. van Johannis,</span><span class="font3"> 1888) advanced the theory&nbsp;of two Jewish sources </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(k</span><span class="font3"> and □), which were subsequently&nbsp;worked over by a Christian redactor. Such a theory as that&nbsp;just mentioned hopelessly fails to account for the linguistic&nbsp;unity of the book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A very elaborate form of this theory was issued in 1884 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Offenbarung Johannis)</span><span class="font3"> by Spitta, who found three main&nbsp;sources in the Apocalypse. First, there was the primitive&nbsp;Christian apocalypse embracing the letters and the seals written&nbsp;by John Mark soon after </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 60,—i. 4-6, 9-19, ii. 1—iii. 22,&nbsp;iv.-vi., viii. 1, vii. 9-17, xix. 9b, 10, xxii. 8, 10-13, 16a, 17, 18a,&nbsp;20b—21. Secondly, the trumpet source of the time of Caligula&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(circa</span><span class="font3"> 40),—vii. 1-8, viii. 2-ix., x. 1-7, xi. 15, 19, xii .-xiii. 18,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">xiv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ι-ii,</span><span class="font3"> xvi. 13-20, xix. 11-21, xx. 1-3, 8-15, xxi. 1, 5a, 6a.&nbsp;Thirdly, the vials source from the time of Pompey </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(circa</span><span class="font3"> 63),—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">x. ib, 2a, 8a, 9b, 10-11, xi. 1-13, 15b, 17, 18, xiv. 14-20,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">xv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2-6, 8, xvi. 1-12, 17a, 21, xvii. i-6a, xviii. 1-23, xix. 1-8,&nbsp;xxi. 9-xxii. 3a, 15. The rest of the book is from the hands of&nbsp;the redactor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1891 Schmidt resolved the book into three independent sources which were put together by a redactor </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Anmerkungen&nbsp;über</span><span class="font3"> d. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Komposition der Offenb. Johannis).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In 1895 Briggs </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Messiah of the Apostles,</span><span class="font3"> 1895) developed this theory to a still more extreme degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Fragment Hypothesis.—</span><span class="font3">The previous theories have brought&nbsp;to light and emphasized the fact that within the Apocalypse&nbsp;there are passages' inconsistent with the tone and character of&nbsp;the whole. But, notwithstanding this fact, the Apocalypse&nbsp;gives a strong impression of its unity. Thus apparently the&nbsp;only remaining theory which can account for both these phenomena is that at which we have now arrived, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font3"> the fragment&nbsp;hypothesis. To Weizsäcker we owe the first statement of this&nbsp;theory: In 1882 </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Theol. Litteraturz.</span><span class="font3"> pp. 78-9) he suggested</span></p>
