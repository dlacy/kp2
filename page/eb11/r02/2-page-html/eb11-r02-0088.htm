<p><span class="font3">the question arose as to its morphological significance; whether it is.to be regarded as a modified form of the gametophyte, or as an&nbsp;altogether new form intercalated in the life-history: iij other&nbsp;words, whether the alternation is“ homologous ”or“ antithetic.”&nbsp;In certain plants there is a succession of forms which are undoubtedly homologous: for instance, in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Coleochaete</span><span class="font3"> where a&nbsp;succession of individuals without sexual organs is produced by&nbsp;zoospores (gonidia). The main fact that has been established is&nbsp;that the sporophyte, from the simple zygote of the Thallophyta&nbsp;to the spore-bearing plant of the Phanerogams, is characterized by its diploid nuclei; that it is a diplophyte, in contrast&nbsp;to the haplophytic gametophyte. Were these nuclear characters&nbsp;absolutely universal, there could be no question but that the&nbsp;sporophyte is an altogether new antithetic form, and not an&nbsp;homologous generation. But certain exceptions to the rule have&nbsp;been detected, which are described under </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Abnormalities of Reproduction:</span><span class="font3"> at present it will suffice to say that such things as&nbsp;a diploid gametophyte and a haploid sporophyte have been observed in certain ferns. It can only be inferred that alternation&nbsp;of generations is not absolutely dependent upon the periodic&nbsp;halving in meiosis and the subsequent doubling by a sexual act,&nbsp;of the number of chromosomes in the nuclei, though the two&nbsp;sets of phenomena usually coincide. It must not, however,&nbsp;be overlooked that these exceptional cases occur in plants&nbsp;presenting an abnormal life-history: the fact remains that where&nbsp;there is both normal spore-formation with meiosis, and a subsequent sexual act, the haploid form is the gametophyte, the&nbsp;diploid the sporophyte. But the actual observation of a haploid&nbsp;sporophytè and of a diploid gametophyte makes it clear that&nbsp;however generally useful the nuclear characters may be in the&nbsp;distinction of sporophyte and gametophyte, they do not afford&nbsp;an absolute criterion, and therefore their value in determining&nbsp;homologies is debatable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">IV. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Abnormalities of Reproduction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In what may be regarded as the type of normal life-history, the transition from the one generation to the other is marked by&nbsp;definite processes: there is the meiotic development of spores&nbsp;by the sporophyte, and the sexual production of a zygote, or&nbsp;something analogous to it, by the gametophyte. But it has been&nbsp;mentioned in the preceding pages that the transition may, in&nbsp;certain cases, be effected in other ways, which may be regarded&nbsp;as abnormal, though they are constant enough in the plants in&nbsp;which they occur, in fact as manifestations of reproductive&nbsp;degeneration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In the first place, the sporophyte may be developed either after an abnormal sexual act, or without any preceding sexual&nbsp;act at all, a condition known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">apogamy.</span><span class="font3"> In the second, the&nbsp;gametophyte may be developed otherwise than from a post-meiotic spore, a condition known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">apospory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">• Apogamy.</span><span class="font2">—The cases to be considered under this head may be arranged in two groups:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">• 'l. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudapogarny: sexual act abnormal.—</span><span class="font2">The following abnormalities have been observed :—</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(d)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no female organ: fusion takes place between two</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">2. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eu-apogamy: no kind of sexual act—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thegametophyte is haploid :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(a) </span><span class="font2">The sporophyte is developed from the unfertilized oosphere: no such case of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">true parthenogenesis</span><span class="font2"> has yet&nbsp;been observed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">In all the cases enumerated under </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eu-apogamy, </span><span class="font2">apogamy is associated with some form of apospory’ except&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nephrodium molle,</span><span class="font2"> full details of which have not yet been&nbsp;published.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Many other ferns are known to be apogamous, but they are not included here because the details of their&nbsp;nuclear structure have not been investigated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Apospory.</span><span class="font2">—The known modes of apospory may be arranged as follows:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pseudapospory: a spore is formed but without meiosis, so that&nbsp;it is diploid-</span><span class="font2">—observed only in heterosporous plants, viz. certain&nbsp;Species of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marsilia (e.g. Marsilia Drummondii)</span><span class="font2"> where the megaspore&nbsp;has a diploid nucleus (32 chromosomes) and the resulting prothallium&nbsp;and female organs are also diploid (Strasburger); and in various&nbsp;Phanerogams, some Compositae </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Taraxacum</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Antennaria alpina,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Juel), some Rosaceae </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Eu-Alchemitla<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font2">  Strasburger), and occasionally&nbsp;in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Thalictrum Purpurascens</span><span class="font2"> (Overton), where the megaspore (embryo-sac) is diploid; in some species of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hieracium</span><span class="font2"> it has been found&nbsp;(Rosenberg) that adventitious diploid embryo-sacs are developed in&nbsp;the nucellus: these plants are also apogamous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eu-apospory: no spore is formed</span><span class="font2">—of this there are two&nbsp;varieties :</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With meiosis: this occurs in some Thallophyta which form</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">no spores; the sporophyte of the Fucaceae bears no spores, consequently meiosis takes place in the developing&nbsp;sexual organs; the. Conjugate Green Algae also have no&nbsp;spores, meiosis taking place in the germinating zygospore,&nbsp;which develops directly into the sexual plant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(b)</span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without meiosis: the gametophyte is developed upon the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">sporophyte by budding; · that is, spore-reproduction is replaced by a vegetative process: for instance, in mosses&nbsp;it has been found possible to induce the development of&nbsp;protonema, the first stage of the gametophyte, from tissue-cells of the sporogonium: similarly, in certain ferns&nbsp;(varieties of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Athyrium Filix-foemina, Scolopendrium&nbsp;vulgare, Lastraea pseudo-mas, Polystichum angulare,</span><span class="font2"> and&nbsp;in the species </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pteris aquilina</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aspleniurn dirnorphum),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the gametophyte (prothallium) is developed by budding&nbsp;on the leaf of the sporophyte, and in some of these cases it&nbsp;has been ascertained that the gametophyte so developed&nbsp;has the same number (2x).of chromosomes in its nuclei as&nbsp;the sporophyte that bears it—that is, it is diploid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Apospory has.been found to be frequently associated with apogamy ; in fact, in the absence of meiosis, this&nbsp;association would appear to be inevitable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Combined Apospory and Apogamy.—</span><span class="font3">Instances have been given of the occurrence of both apospory and apogamy in the&nbsp;same life-history; but in all of them there is a regular succession&nbsp;of sporophyte and gametophyte. The cases now to be considered are those in which one or other of the generations gives&nbsp;rise directly to its like, sporophyte to sporophyte, gametophyte&nbsp;to gametophyte, the normally intervening generation being&nbsp;omitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is possible to conceive of this abbreviation of the life-history taking place in various ways. Thus, a sporophyte might be&nbsp;developed from a haploid spore instead of a gametophyte as is&nbsp;the normal case, but this has not been observed: again, a&nbsp;sporophyte might be developed from a diploid spore (as distinguished from a zygote or a diploid oosphere), a possibility&nbsp;that is to some extent realized in the life-history </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font3">some&nbsp;Uredineae in which successive forms of the polymorphic sporophyte are developed from diplogonidia. Similarly a .gametophyte might be developed from a fertilized or an unfertilized</span></p>
