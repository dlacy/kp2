anciently called <hi rend="italic">Thermes Selinuntiae,</hi> in Sicily, derives its preſent denomination from the Arabic word <hi rend="italic">Scheich.</hi> It is a very ancient place, being mentioned in the account of the wars between the Greeks and Carthaginians, to the latter of whom it belonged. It is defended by ancient walls and the caſtle of Luna. It ſtands upon a very ſteep rock, hanging over the ſea, and excavated in every direction into prodigious magazines, where the corn of the neighbouring territory is depoſited for exportation; there is no harbour, but a ſmall bay formed by a wooden pier, where lighters lie to load the corn which they carry out about a mile to ſhips to anchor.</p><p>The town is irregularly but ſubſtantially built, and contains 13,000 inhabitants, though Amico's Lexicon <hi rend="italic">. Topographicum</hi> ſays the laſt enumeration found only 9484. His accounts do not take in eccleſiaſtics, and ſeveral denominations of lay perſons.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
