Shah Nadir, an lndian prince, had two principal diamonds in his throne, one of them denominated the Sun of the Sea, and the other the Moon of the Mountain. When that prince was assassinated, many precious ornaments belonging to the crown were pillaged, and privately disposed of by the soldiers who shared the plunder.</p><p>Shafras, who was called <hi rend="italic">Millionshik</hi> at Astrakhan, had then his residence at Bassora, with two of his brothers. A chief of the Afghans one day applied to him, and proposed to sell the diamond already mentioned for a very moderate sum (probably the Moon of the Mountain), together with a very large emerald, a ruby of considerable size, and other precious stones of less value. Shafras was astonished at the offer ; and giving out that he had not a sufficient sum to purchase them, he requested time to consult with his brothers on the subject. The vender did not again make his appearance, probably from suspicious motives. Shafras, with the approbation of his brothers, went directly in search of the stranger with the jewels, but by that time he had left Bassora. Shafras, however, accidentally met him at Bagdad, and paid him 50,000 piastres (L.8958. 6s. 8d.) for all his jewels. Shafras and his brothers, being well aware that the most profound secrecy was absolutely necessary, resolved to remain at Bassora.</p><p>At the expiration of twelve years, Shafras set off with the largest of the jewels, directing his route through Sham and Constantinople, and afterwards through Hungary and Silesia to the city of Amsterdam by land, where he publicly offered them for sale.</p><p>It is reported that the British government was among the bidders. The Russian court sent for the large diamond, with an offer to reimburse all reasonable expenses if the price could not be agreed on. When the diamond arrived, Count Panin, the Russian minister, made the following offer to Shafras. Besides the patent of hereditary nobility, which the vendor demanded, he was to receive an annual pension of 6000 roubles during life, 500,000 roubles in cash (L.l 12,500 sterling), one fifth of which was to be payable on demand, and the remainder by instalments in the course of ten years. He also claimed the order of nobility for his brothers, persisting so obstinately in his demands, that the diamond was returned.</p><p>Shafras was now very much perplexed. He had involved himself in expenses, was forced to pay interest for considerable sums of borrowed money, and he saw no prospect of selling the jewel to advantage. The negociation was recommenced with Russia by Count Gregory Grigorevitsh Orlof, afterwards created a prince of the empire ; and the diamond was purchased for 450,000 roubles (L. 105,250) ready money, together with a grant of Russian nobility. We are informed that 120,000 roubles (L.27,000) fell to the share of the negociators for commission, interest, and similar expenses. Shafras settled at Astrakhan ; and his riches, which by inheritance devolved to his daughters, have been in a great measure dissipated by the extravagance of his sons-in-law.</p><p>SHAFTESBURY, a town in the hundred of Rudland, in the county of Dorset, 101 miles from London. It stands on a hill, is not well supplied with water, and the houses are generally of an humble character. It contains three parishes, with their respective churches. It is an ancient town, supposed to have been founded by Alfred. It is a borough, with a mayor, recorder, and twelve burgesses, and returned two members to parliament till 1832, but now elects only one. The chief trade is making shirt-buttons. The population in 1821 amounted to 2903, and in 1831 to 3061.</p><p>SHAGREEN, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Chagreen</hi>, in <hi rend="italic">commerce,</hi> a kind of</p><p>grained leather prepared of the skin of a species of squalus, and much used in covering cases, books, and other articles. The best is that which is brought from Constantinople, and is of a brownish colour ; the white is the worst. It is extremely hard, yet, when steeped in water, it becomes very soft and pliable ; and hence it is of great use among case-makers. It takes any colour that is given to it, red, green, yellow, or black. It is frequently counterfeited, by using morocco formed like shagreen ; but this last is distinguished by its peeling off, which the first does not.</p><p>SHAHABAD, an extensive town and district of Hindustan, province of Bahar, most advantageously situated between the rivers Soane and Ganges. It is fertile and tolerably well cultivated, and produces barley, wheat, tobacco, and some pease of a small kind. It is estimated to contain more than a million of inhabitants, in the proportion of nineteen Hindus to one Mahommedan. Its chief towns are Chunar, Boujepore, and Arrah. The town is situated on the east side of the Gurrah river, in the district of Khyrabad. It was formerly a large place, but has now fallen greatly to decay. Long. 79. 55 E. Lat. 27. 39. N. There is another town of this name, in the province of Delhi, belonging to the Sikhs, which has also fallen into decay. It is 105 miles north by west from Delhi. Long. 76. 28. E. Lat. 30. 12. N.</p><p>SHAHJEHANPOOR, a considerable town of Hindustan, in the Mahratta territories, province of Malwah, situated on the banks of the Sagormutty river, forty miles north-north- east from Oojain. Long. 76.18. E. Lat 23. 28. N. There is another town of the same name, in the province of Delhi, district of Bareilly, situated on the Gurrah river, ninety-five miles north-east from Lucknow. Long. 79. 53. E. Lat. 27. 51. N. Both these towns are called after Shah Jehan, who reigned in the middle of the seventeenth century.</p><p>SHAHNOOR, <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanore, Sevanore,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Savanoor,</hi> a town of Hindustan, in the province of Bejapoor, fifty miles south-south-east from Darwar, and capital of a district of the same name. It was formerly a fortified town, and contained a palace and many good buildings, the greater part of which are now in ruins. It is a place of no strength, though it is enclosed by a wall and ditch. Outside the wall to the northward are several long streets of houses, mostly uninhabited. This place was conquered from the Hindus by the Bhamenee sovereigns in 1397 ; it afterwards became the capital of a small Patan state, its hereditary’ possessor receiving the title of nabob. Abdul Hakeem Khan, the seventh lineal descendant, reigned in 1792, and was tributary to Tippoo till 1784, when he accepted the protection of the Mahrattas, on which his territories were ravaged by ' the armies of Tippoo, the palaces and public buildings were destroyed and razed, and the whole country was laid waste. In 1792 it was wrested from him and restored to the nabob. The district is now under the peishwa’s government, being part of the territory received in exchange from the British government for an equivalent in Bundelcund. Long. 75. 22. E. Lat. 15. 1.

There are various other towns in Hindustan of this name, which signifies King’s Town, many of them of too little consequence to merit any particular notice.</p><p>SHAIRGHUR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Delhi, twenty-six miles north from Bareilly. Long. 79. 21. E. Lat. 28. 40. N.</p></body></text></TEI>
