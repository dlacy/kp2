There is the like indemnifying clauſe, in caſe any of the mob be unfortunately killed in the endeavour to diſperſe them ; being copied ſrom the act of queen Mary. And by a fubſequent clauſe of the new act, if any perſon, ſo riotouſly aſſembled, begin even before proclamation to pull down any church, chapel, meeting-houſe, dwell-ing-houſe, or out-houſes, they ſhall be felons without benefit of clergy.</p><p>Riots, routs, and unlawful aſſemblies, muſt have three perſons at leaſt to conſtitute them. An <hi rend="italic">unlawful af-ſembly</hi>  is, when three, or more, do aſſemble themſelves together to do an unlawful act, as to pull down incloſures, to deſtroy a warren or the game therein ; and part without doing it, or making any motion towards it. A <hi rend="italic">rout</hi>  is where three or more meet to do an unlawful act upon a common quarrel, as forcibly breaking down fences upon a right claimed of common, or of way, and make ſome advances towards it. A <hi rend="italic">riot </hi>is where three or more actually do an unlawful act of violence, either with or without a common cauſe or quarrel ; as if they beat a man ; or hunt and kill game in another’s park, chaſe, warren, or liberty ; or do any other unlawful act with force and violence ; or even do a lawful act, as removing a nuiſance, in a violent and tumultuous manner. The puniſhment of unlawful aſſemblies, if to the number of 12, we have juſt now ſeen, may be capital, according to the circumſtances that attend it ; but, ſrom the number of three to eleven, is by fine and impriſonment only. The ſame is the caſe in riots and routs by the common law ; to which the pillory in very enormous caſes has been ſometimes ſu-peradded. And by the ſtatute 13 Hen. IV. c. 7. any two juſtices, together with the ſheriff or under-ſheriff of the county, may come with the <hi rend="italic">po[fe cornitatus,</hi>  if need be, and ſuppreſs any ſuch riot, aſſembly, or rout, arreſt the rioters, and record upon the ſpot the nature and circumſtances of the whole tranſaction ; which record alone ſhall be a ſufficient conviction of the offenders. In the interpretation of which ſtatute it hath been holden, that all perſons, noblemen and others, except women, clergymen, perſons decrepit, and infants under 15, are bound to attend the juſtices in ſup-preſſing a riot, upon pain of fine and impriſonment; and that any battery, wounding, or killing the rioters, that may happen in ſuppreſſing the riot, is juſtiſiable. So that our ancient law, previous to the modern riot-act, ſeems pretty well to have guarded againſt any violent breach of the public peace ; eſpecially as any riotous aſſembly on a public or general account, as to re-dreſs grievances or pull down all 1nclofure3, and alſo re-ſiſting the king’s forces if ſent to keep the peace, may amount to overt acts of high treaſon, by levying war againſt the king.</p><p>RIPEN, a town of Denmark, in north Jutland, and capital of a dioceſe of the ſame name, with a biſhop’s ſee, a good harbour, a caſtle, two colleges, and a public library. The tombs of ſeveral of the kings of Denmark are in the cathedral church, which is a very handſome ſtructure. The harbour, which has contributed greatly to the proſperity of this place, is at a</p><lb/><p>ſmall diſtance, being ſeated at the mouth of the river Nipſaa, in a country which ſupplies the beſt beeves in Denmark. It is 47 miles north-weft of Sleſwick and 25 ſouth-by-weſt of Wiburg. E∙ Long. 8. 94. N. Lat. 55. 25. The dioceſe is bounded on the north by thoſe of Wiburg and Athuys, on the ſouth by the duchy of Sleſwick, and on the eaſt and weft by the ſea.</p><p>RIPENING <hi rend="italic">of Grain,</hi>  means its arriving to maturity. The following paper, which appeared in the firſt volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society of E-dinburgh, may be worthy the attention of farmers in this country ; where it frequently happens, from continued rains, that the corn is quite green when the ſroſt ſets in ; in conſequence of which, the farmers cut it down, without thinking it can poſſibly arrive at further maturity.</p><p>“ Summer 1782 having been remarkably cold and unfavourable, the harveſt was very late, and much of the grain, eſpecially oats, was green even in October, In the beginning of October the cold was ſo great, that, in one night, there was produced on ponds near Kinneil, in the neighbourhood of Borrowſtounneſs, ice three quarters of an inch thick. It was apprehended by many farmers, that ſuch a degree of cold would effectually prevent the further filling and ripening of their corn. In order to aſcertain this point, Dr Roebuck ſelected ſeveral ſtalks of oats, of nearly equal fulneſs, and immediately cut thoſe which, on the moſt attentive compariſon, appeared the beſt, and marked the others, but allowed them to remain in the field 14 days longer ; at the end of which time they, too, were cut, and kept in a dry room for 10 days. The grains of each parcel were then weighed ; when 11 of the grains which had been left ftanding in the field were found to be equal in weight to 30 of the grains which had been cut a fortnight ſooner, though even the beſt of the grains were far from being ripe. During that, fortnight (viz. from October 7th to October 2iſt) the average heat, according to Fahrenheit’s thermometer, which was obſerved every day at eight o’clock in the morning and fix in the evening, was a little above 43 „ Dr Roebuck obſerves, that this ripening and filling of corn in ſo low a temperature ſhould be the leſs ſurpri-fing to us, when we reflect, that ſeed-corn will vegetate in the ſame degree of heat ; and he draws an important inference from his obſervations, viz. That farmers ſhotild be cautious of cutting down their unripe corn, on the ſuppofition that in a cold autumn it could fill no more.”</p><p>A writer in the Scots Magazine ſor June 1792, under the ſignature of <hi rend="italic">Agricola,</hi>  when ſpeaking on this ſubject, adds the following piece of information, viz. “ That grain cut down before it is quite ripe will grow or ſpring equally well as ripe and plump grain, provided it is properly preferred. I relate this from a fact, and alſo oa the authority of one of the moſt judicious and experienced farmers in this iſland, William Craik of ArbigLnd, Eſq; near Dumfries, who was taught by ſuch a ſeaſon as this threatens to prove. This being the caſe, every wife economical farmer will preſerve his ripe and plump grain for bread, and ſow the green and ſeemingly ſhri-velled grain, with a perfect conviction that the plants proceeding from ſuch feed will yield as ſtrong and thriving corn as what grows from plump feed. By this means the farmer will enjoy the double advantage of having the corn moſt productive in flour for bread, and</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
