            <p>'heart of man. The sentiment is congenial to his nature, and therefore it is
                universal ; and we could almost appeal to the feelings of every reader, whether he
                does not perceive it in his own breast. Perhaps we may be mistaken in our opinion in
                the case of the corrupted inhabitants of</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>the populous and busy cities, who are habituated to the fond contemplation of their
                own individual exertions as the sources of all their hopes. Give the shoemaker but
                leather and a few tools, and he defies the powers of nature to disappoint him ; but
                the simpler inhabitants of the country,</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>the most worthy and the most respectable part of every nation, after equal, perhaps
                greater exertion, both of skill and of industry, are more accustomed to resign
                themselves to the great ministers of Providence, and to look up to heaven for the “
                early and the latter rains,” without which all their labours are fruitless.</p>

            <p>--Extrema per illos</p>
            <p>Numenque excedens terris vestigia fecit.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>And among the husbandmen and the shepherds of all nations and ages, we find the same
                fond attachment to their springs and rivulets.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Fortunate senex, hie, inter flumina nota Et fontes sacros, frigus captabis
                opacum,</p>

            <p>was the mournful ejaculation of poor Meliboeus. We hardly know a river of any note in
                our own country whose source is not looked on with some respect.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>We repeat our assertion, that this worship was the offspring of affection and
                gratitude, and that it is giving a very unfair and false picture of the human mind
                to ascribe these superstitions to the working of fear alone. These would have
                represented the river-gods as seated on ruins, brandishing rooted-up trees, with
                angry looks, pouring out their sweeping torrents. But no such thing. The lively
                imagination of the Greeks felt, and expressed with an energy unknown to all other
                nations, every emotion of the human soul. They figured the Naiads as beautiful
                nymphs, pat</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>terns <hi rend="italic">of</hi> gentleness and of elegance. These they represented as
                partially attached to the children of men ; and their interference in human affairs
                is always in acts of kind assistance and protection. They resemble, in this
                    respect,<hi rend="sup"> </hi>the rural deities<hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                northern nations, the fairies, but without their caprices and resentments. And if we
                attend to the descriptions and representations of their river-gods, beings armed
                with power, an attribute which slavish fear</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>never fails to couple with cruelty and vengeance, we shall find the same expression
                Of affectionate trust and confidence in their kind dispositions. They are generally
                called by the respectable but endearing name <hi rend="italic">of father. “</hi> Da
                Tyberi pater, ’ says Virgil. Mr Bruce says that the Nile at its source is called the
                    <hi rend="italic">abay,</hi> or “ father.” We observe this word, or its radix,
                blended with many names of rivers of the east ; and think it probable that when our
                traveller got this name from the inhabitants <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                neighbourhood, they applied to the stream what is meant to express the tutelar
                or</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>presiding spirit. The river-gods are always represented as venerable old men, to
                indicate their being coeval with the world. But it is always a <hi rend="italic"
                    >cruda viridisque senectus, and </hi>they are never represented as oppressed
                with age and decrepitude. Their beards are long and flowing, their looks placid,
                their attitude easy, reclined on a bank, covered, as they are crowned, with
                never-fading sedges and bulrushes,</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>and leaning on their urns, from which they pour out their plentiful and fertilizing
                streams. Mr Bruce’s description of the sources of the Nile, and of the respect paid
                to the sacred waters, has not a frowning feature ; and the hospitable old man, with
                his fair daughter frepone, and the gentle priesthood which peopled the little
                village of Geesh, form a contrast with the neighbouring Galla (among whom a mili</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>tary leader was called the <hi rend="italic">lamb,</hi> because he did not murder
                pregnant women), which very clearly paints the inspiring principle of this
                superstition. Pliny says (lib. viii. 81 that at the source of the Clitumnus there is
                an ancient temple highly respected. The presence and the power of the divinity are
                expressed by the fates which stand in the vestibule. Around this temple are several
                little chapels, each of which covers a sacred fountain ; for the Clitumnus is the
                father of several little rivers which unite their streams with him. At some distance
                below the temple is a bridge</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>which divides the sacred waters from those which are open to common use. No one must
                presume to set his foot in the streams above this bridge ; and to step over any of
                them is an indignity which renders a person infamous. They can only be visited in a
                consecrated boat. Below the bridge we are permitted to bathe, and the place is
                incessantly occupied by the neighbouring villagers. See also Vibius Se</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>quester Oberlini, p. 101-103, and 221-223; also Sueton. <hi rend="italic"
                    >Caligula,</hi> c. 43; Virg. <hi rend="italic">Georg,</hi> ii. 146.</p>
            <p>What is the cause of all this? The Clitumnus, near its source, flows through the
                richest pastures, through which it was carefully distributed by numberless drains ;
                and these nourished cattle of such spotless whiteness and extraordi</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>nary beauty that they were sought for with eagerness over all Italy’, as the most
                acceptable victims in their sacrifices. Is not this superstition then an effusion of
                gratitude ?</p>
            <p>Such are the dictates of kind-hearted nature in our breasts, before it has been
                vitiated by vanity and self-conceit, and we should not be ashamed of feeling the
                impression. We</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>hardly think of making any apology for dwelling a little on this incidental
                circumstance of the superstitious veneration paid to rivers. We cannot think that
                our readers will be displeased at having agreeable ideas excited in their
                minds, being always of opinion that the torch of true philosophy will not only
                enlighten the understanding, but also warm and cherish the affections of the
                heart-</p>
            <p>With respect to the origin of rivers, we have very little to offer in this place. It
                is obvious to every person, that</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>besides the torrents which carry down into the rivers what part of the rains and
                melted snow's is not absorbed by the soil or taken up by the plants which cover the
                earth, they</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>are <hi rend="italic">ted</hi> either immediately or remotely by the springs. A few
                remarkable streams rush at once out <hi rend="italic">of the</hi> earth in force,
                and must be considered as the continuation of subterraneous rivers, whose origin we
                are therefore to seek out ; and we do not know any circumstance in which their first
                beginnings differ from those <hi rend="italic">of</hi> other rivers, which
                are formed by the union of little streams and rills, each of</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>which has its own source in a spring or fountain. This question, therefore, what is
                the process of nature, and what are the supplies which fill our springs ? will be
                treated of under the word Spring.</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Whatever be the source of rivers, it is to be met with in almost every’ part of the
                globe. The crust of earth with which the rocky framing of this globe is covered is
                generally stratified. Some of these strata are extremely pervious to water, having
                but small attraction for its particles,</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>and being very porous. Such is the quality of gravelly strata in an eminent degree.
                Other strata are much more firm, or attract water more strongly, and refuse it
                passage. This is the case with firm rock and with clay. When a stratum of the first
                kind has one of the other immediately under it, the water remains in the upper
                stratum, and bursts out wherever the sloping sides of the hills cut off the
                strata,</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>and this will be the form of a trickling spring, because the water in the porous
                stratum is greatly obstructed in its passage towards the outlet. As this irregular
                formation of the earth is very general, we must have springs, and of course rivers
                or rivulets, in every corner where there are high grounds.</p>
            <p>Rivers flow from the higher to the low grounds. It is</p>
