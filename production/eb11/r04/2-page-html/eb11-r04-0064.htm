<p><span class="font0">HOME </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Roma},</span><span class="font0"> the capital of the modern kingdom of Italy, in the province of Rome, on the river Tiber, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">17</span><span class="font0"> miles N.E. from&nbsp;its mouth on the Mediterranean. As formerly the centre of the&nbsp;ancient Roman republic and of the Roman empire, and the&nbsp;headquarters of the Christian Church, Rome is unique among&nbsp;historical cities, and its antiquarian interest far surpasses that&nbsp;of any other locality in the world. In the following account&nbsp;the general subject of Rome is treated broadly under two&nbsp;aspects, themselves subdivided. These are:—(1) the topography and growth of the city of Rome, the evolution of which&nbsp;is traced from the earliest times to the present, and (2) Roman&nbsp;history, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the political and social history of the Roman republic,&nbsp;empire and medieval commune.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The nine or ten hills and ridges on which the city stands are formed of masses of tufa or conglomerated sand and ashes&nbsp;thrown out by neighbouring volcanoes now extinct, but active&nbsp;down to a very recent period. One group of these volcanoes is&nbsp;that around Lago Bracciano, while another, still nearer to Rome,&nbsp;composes the Alban Hills. That some at least of these craters&nbsp;have been in a-state of activity at no very distant period has&nbsp;been shown by the discovery at many places of broken pottery&nbsp;and bronze implements below the strata of tufa or other volcanic&nbsp;deposits. Traces of human life have even been found below&nbsp;that great flood of lava which, issuing from the Alban Hills,&nbsp;flowed towards the site of Rome, only stopping about 3 miles&nbsp;short, by the tomb of Cecilia Metella.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The superficial strata on which Rome is built are of three main kinds: (1) the plains and valleys on the left bank of the Tiber&nbsp;are covered, as it were, by a sea of alluvial deposits, in the midst&nbsp;of which (2) the hills of volcanic origin rise like so many islands;&nbsp;and (3) on the right bank of the Tiber, around the Janiculan&nbsp;and Vatican Hills, are extensive remains of an ancient sea-beach, conspicuous in parts by its fine golden sand and its deposits of greyish white potter’s clay. From its yellow sand the&nbsp;Janiculan has been sometimes known as the Golden Hill, a&nbsp;name which survives in the church on its summit called S. Pietro&nbsp;in Montorio (Monte d’Oro). In addition to these three chief&nbsp;deposits, at a few places, especially in the Aventine and Pincian&nbsp;Hills, under-strata of travertine crop out—a hard limestone&nbsp;rock, once in solution in running water, and deposited gradually&nbsp;as the water lost its carbonic-acid solvent, a process still rapidly&nbsp;going on at Term, Tivoli and other places in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;The conditions under which the tufa hills were formed have been&nbsp;very various, as is clearly seen by an examination of the rock&nbsp;at different places. The volcanic ashes and sand of which the&nbsp;tufa is composed appear in parts to lie just as they were showered&nbsp;down from the crater; in that case it shows but little sign of&nbsp;stratification, and consists wholly of igneous products. In parts&nbsp;time and pressure have hound together these scoriae into a soft&nbsp;and friable rock; in other places they still lie in loose sandy&nbsp;beds and can be dug out with the spade. Other masses of&nbsp;tufa again show signs either of having been deposited in water,&nbsp;or else washed away from their first resting-place and redeposited&nbsp;with visihle stratifications; this is shown by the water-worn&nbsp;pebbles and chips of limestone rock, which form a conglomerate&nbsp;bound together by the volcanic ashes into a sort of natural&nbsp;cement. A third variety is that which exists on the Palatine&nbsp;Kill. Here the shower of red-hot ashes has evidently fallen&nbsp;on a thickly growing forest, and the burning wood, partly&nbsp;smothered hy the ashes, has been converted into charcoal,&nbsp;large masses of which are embedded in the tufa rock. In some&nbsp;places charred branches of trees, their form well preserved, can&nbsp;be easily distinguished. The so-called “ wall of Romulus ” is&nbsp;built of this conglomerate of tufa and charred wood; a very&nbsp;perfect section of the branch of a tree is visible on one of the&nbsp;blocks by the Scalae Caci.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So great have been the physical changes in the site of Rome since the first dawn of the historic period that it is difficult&nbsp;now to realize what its aspect once was. The Forum Romanum,&nbsp;the Velabrum, the great Campus Martius (now the most&nbsp;crowded part of modern Rome), and other valleys were once&nbsp;almost impassable marshes or pools of water (Ov. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fasti,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">vi. 401; Dionys. ii. 50). The draining of these valleys was&nbsp;effected by means of the great cloacae, which were among&nbsp;the earliest important architectural works of Rome (Varro,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ling. Lat.</span><span class="font0"> iv. 149). Again, the various hills and ridges were&nbsp;once more numerous and very much more abrupt than they&nbsp;are now. At an early period, when each hill was crowned by a&nbsp;'Separate village fort, the great object of the inhabitants was&nbsp;to increase the steepness of its cliffs and render access difficult.&nbsp;At a later time, when Rome was united under one government, the very physical peculiarities which had originally&nbsp;made its hills so populous, through their natural adaptability&nbsp;for defence, became extremely inconvenient in a united city,&nbsp;where architectural symmetry and splendour were above all&nbsp;things aimed at. Hence the most gigantic engineering works&nbsp;were undertaken: tops of hills were levelled, whole ridges&nbsp;cut away, and gentle slopes formed in the place of abrupt&nbsp;cliffs. The levelling of the Velia and the excavation of the&nbsp;site for Trajan’s forum are instances of this. The same works&nbsp;were continued in the middle ages, as when in the 14th century&nbsp;an access was made to the Capitoline Arx@@<sup>1</sup> from the side of&nbsp;the Campus Martius; up to that time a steep cliff had prevented&nbsp;all approach except from the side of the Forum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Finally, after Rome had become the capital of united Italy, in the last quarter of the 19th century, an extensive government plan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{piano regulatore)</span><span class="font0"> was gradually carried out, with&nbsp;the object of reducing hills and valley to a uniform level and&nbsp;constructing wide boulevards on the chessboard method of&nbsp;a modem American city. The constant fires which have at&nbsp;times devastated Rome have been a powerful agent in obliterating the natural contour of the ground; and the accumulated&nbsp;rubbish from this and other causes has in some places overlaid&nbsp;the ground to a depth of 40 ft., notably in the valleys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Ancient City</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief building materials used in ancient Rome may be enumerated as follows: (1) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tufa,</span><span class="font0"> the “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ruber et niger&nbsp;tophus”</span><span class="font0"> of Vitruvius (ii. 7), varying in colour from&nbsp;warm brown to yellow or greyish green (called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">capellaccio).</span><span class="font0"> The Aventine, Palatine and Capitoline&nbsp;Hills contained quarries of the tufa, much worked at an early&nbsp;period (see Liv. xxvi. 27, xxxix. 44, and Varro, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L.L.</span><span class="font0"> iv. 151).&nbsp;It is a very bad “ weather-stone,” but stands well if protected&nbsp;with stucco (Plin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font0"> xxxvi. 166).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lapis Albanus,</span><span class="font0"> from</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alba Longa, of volcanic origin, a conglomerate of ashes, gravel and fragments of stone; its quarries are still worked at Albano&nbsp;and Marino. This is now called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peperino,</span><span class="font0"> from the black&nbsp;scoriae, like peppercorns, with which the brown conglomerate&nbsp;mass is studded. (3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lapis Gabinus,</span><span class="font0"> from Gabii, very similar&nbsp;to the last, but harder and a better weather-stone; it contains&nbsp;large lumps of broken lava, products of an earlier eruption,&nbsp;and small pieces of limestone. According to Tacitus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Ann.</span><span class="font0"> xv.&nbsp;43), it is fire-proof, and this is also the case with the Alban&nbsp;stone. Lapis Gabinus is now called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sperone.</span><span class="font0"> (4) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Silex</span><span class="font0"> (mod.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">selce),</span><span class="font0"> a lava from the now extinct volcanoes in the Alban&nbsp;Hills, used for paving roads; when broken into small&nbsp;pieces and mixed with lime and pozzolana it formed an&nbsp;immensely durable concrete. It is dark grey, very hard and&nbsp;breaks with a slightly conchoidal fracture (Plin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font0"> xxxvi.&nbsp;<sup>I</sup>3S&gt; Vitr. ii. 7), but does not resemble what is now called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">silex&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or flint. (5) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lapis Tiburtinus</span><span class="font0"> (travertine), the chief quarries&nbsp;of which are at Tibur (Tivoli) and other places along the&nbsp;river Anio; a hard pure carbonate of lime, of a creamy white&nbsp;colour, deposited from running or dripping water in a highly</span></p>
