in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the decandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking with thoſe of which the order is doubtful. The calyx is quinquepartite and coloured; there is no corolla; the capſule in the inſide reſembles a berry, is trivalved and unilocular; the ſeeds neſtling.</p><p><note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Niebubr's Travels by Heron.</hi></p></note> SANA, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanaa,</hi> a large, populous, and handſome town of Aſia, capital of Arabia Felix, is ſituated in Proper Yemen, at the foot of mount Nikkum, on which are ſtill to be ſeen the ruins of a caſtle, which the Arabs ſuppoſe to have been built by Shem. Near this mountain ſtands the caſtle; a rivulet runs upon the other fide; and near it is the Buſtan el Metwokkel, a fpacious garden, which was laid out by Imam Metwokkel, and has been embelliſhed with a fine garden by the reigning imam. The walls of the city, which are built of bricks, exclude this garden, which is incloſed within a wall of its own. The city, properly ſo called, is not very extenſive: one may walk round it all in an hour. The city-gates are ſeven. Here are a number of moſques, ſome of which have been built by Turkiſh pachas. Sana has the appearance of being more populous than it actually is; for the gardens occupy a part of the ſpace within the walls. In Sana are only 12 public baths; but many noble palaces, three of the moſt ſplendid of which have been built by the reigning Imam. The palace of the late Imam El Manzor, with ſome others, belong to the royal family, who are very numerous.</p><p>The Arabian palaces are built in a ſtyle of architecture different from ours. The materials are, however, burnt bricks, and ſometimes even hewn ſtones; but the houſes of the common people are of bricks which have been dried in the ſun. There are no glaſs windows, except in one palace, near the citadel. The reſt of the houſes have, inſtead of windows, merely ſhutters, which are opened in fair weather, and ſhut when it is foul. In the laſt caſe, the houſe is lighted by a round wicket, fitted with a piece cf Muſcovy glaſs; ſome of the Arabians uſe ſmall panes of ſtained glaſs from Venice.</p><p>At Sana, and in the other cities of the Eaſt, are great ſimſeras or caravanſeras for merchants and travellers. Each different commodity is ſold in a ſeparate market. In the market for bread, none but women are to be ſeen; and their little ſhops are portable. The ſeveral claſſes of mechanics work, in the ſame manner, in particular quarters in the open ſtreet. Writers go about with their deſkes, and make out brieves, copybooks, and inſtruct ſcholars in the art of writing, all</p><p>at the ſame time. There is one market where old clothes are taken in exchange for new.</p><p>Wood for the carpenter’s purpoſe is extremely dear through Yemen; and wood for the fire at Sana is no leſs ſo. All the hills near the city are bleak and bare, and wood is therefore to be brought hither from the diſtance of three days journey; and a camel’s burthen commonly coſts two crowns. This ſcarcity of wood is particularly ſupplied by the uſe of a little pit-coal. Peats are burnt here; but they are ſo bad, that ſtraw muſt be intermixed to make them burn.</p><p>Fruits are, however, very plenteous at Sana. Here are more than 20 different ſpecies of grapes, which, as they do not all ripen at the ſame time, continue to afford a delicious refreſhment for ſeveral months. The Arabs likewiſe preſerve grapes, by hanging them up in their cellars, and eat them almoſt through the whole year. The Jews make a little wine, and might make more if the Arabs were not ſuch enemies to ſtrong liquors. A Jew convicted of conveying wine into an Arab’s houſe is ſeverely puniſhed; nay, the Jews muſt even uſe great caution in buying and ſelling it among themſelves. Great quantities of grapes are dried here; and the exportation of raiſins from Sana is conſiderable. One fort of theſe grapes are without ſtones, and contains only a ſoft grain, the preſence of which is not perceptible in eating the raiſin.</p><p>In the caſtle, which ſtands on a hill, are two palaces. “I ſaw (ſays Niebuhr) about it ſome ruins of old buildings, but, notwithſtanding the antiquity of the place, no remarkable inſcriptions. There is the mint, and a range of priſons for perſons of different ranks. The reigning Imam reſides in the city; but ſeveral princes of the blood-royal live in the caſtle. The battery is the moſt elevated place about theſe buildings; and there I met with what I had no expectation of, a German mortar, with this inſcription, <hi rend="italic">Jorg Selos Goſmick,</hi> 1513. I ſaw alſo upon the ſame battery ſeven iron cannons, partly buried in the fand, and partly ſet upon broken carriages. Theſe ſeven ſmall cannons, with fix others near the gates, which are fired to announce the return of the different feſtivals, are all the artillery of the capital of Yemen. ”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
