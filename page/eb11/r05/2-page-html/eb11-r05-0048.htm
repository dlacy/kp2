<p><span class="font0">the formula C&amp;H®. It thus possesses the same composition as the hydrocarbon of gutta-percha and.as that of oil of turpentine and&nbsp;other terpenes which are the chief components of essential oils.&nbsp;The properties of caoutchouc clearly show, however, that its actual&nbsp;molecular structure is considerably more complex than is represented by the empirical formula, and that it is to be regarded as the&nbsp;polymer of a terpene or similar hydrocarbon and composed of a&nbsp;cluster of at least ten or twenty molecules of the formula CiHg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When solid caoutchouc is strongly heated it breaks down, without change in its ultimate composition, into a number of simpler liquid&nbsp;hydrocarbons of the terpene class (dipentene, di-isoprene, isoprene,&nbsp;&amp;c.), of which one, isoprene (CgHg), is of simpler structure than oil&nbsp;of turpentine (CioHu), from which it can also be obtained by the&nbsp;action of an intense heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When this volatile liquid hydrocarbon (isoprene) is allowed io stand for some time in a closed bottle, it gradually passes into a&nbsp;substance having the principal properties of natural caoutchouc.&nbsp;The same change of isoprene into caoutchouc may also be effected&nbsp;by the action of certain chemical agents. . 11 may therefore be said&nbsp;that caoutchouc has been already artificially or synthetically prepared, and the possibility of producing synthetic rubber cheaply&nbsp;on a commercial scale remains the only problem. At present&nbsp;the change of isoprene into caoutchouc is mainly of scientific&nbsp;interest in indicating possibilities with regard to the conversion of&nbsp;the liquid globules of the latex into rubber and to the formation&nbsp;of rubber by plants. . The exact chemical nature of caoutchouc, is,&nbsp;however, not determined, and recent researches point to the view&nbsp;that its molecular structure may even be somewhat different from&nbsp;that of the terpenes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The exact manner in which isoprene passes into caoutchouc is also not understood. These problems are, however, certain to be&nbsp;solved in the near future, and then probably caoutchouc may be&nbsp;formed in other ways than from isoprene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The question as to whether synthetic rubber will ever be produced cheaply on a com merical scale is therefore the important one for&nbsp;those who are largely interested in the rubber-planting industry.&nbsp;No definite answer can be given to this question at the present time.&nbsp;Its settlement will depend in part on the cost, of producing rubber&nbsp;from plants, which from their point of view it is to the interests of&nbsp;planters to reduce as far as possible. There are many substances&nbsp;produced by plants which can be synthetically prepared by chemical&nbsp;means, but, as with quinine, the process involved is too costly to&nbsp;enable the synthetic product to compete with the natural product.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief properties of caoutchouc and its employment for technical purposes may now be considered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Caoutchouc is not dissolved by water or alcohol, and is not affected except by the strongest acids. Alkalis have little effect on it&nbsp;under ordinary circumstances, although prolonged contact with&nbsp;ammonia results in a partial change. The best solvents for rubber&nbsp;are carbon bisulphide, benzol and mineral naphtha, carbon tetrachloride and chloroform. These liquids, either alone or mixed,&nbsp;are employed in making the rubber solutions used for technical&nbsp;purposes. Vegetable and other oils rapidly penetrate caoutchouc&nbsp;and lead to deterioration of its properties. Sulphur when warmed&nbsp;with caoutchouc combines with it, and on this fact the vulcanization&nbsp;of rubber depends, and also the production, with an excess of sulphur,&nbsp;of the hard black material known as vulcanite or ebonite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Caoutchouc is a soft elastic resilient solid. In this respect it differs from gutta-percha, which, like caoutchouc, is derived from&nbsp;the latices of certain plants. The technical value of caoutchouc&nbsp;chiefly depends on the extent to which it is capable of being stretched&nbsp;without breaking, and the extent to which it at once returns to its&nbsp;original dimensions. Caoutchouc is a bad conductor of heat and&nbsp;electricity, and alone or mixed with other materials is employed&nbsp;as an electrical insulator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When caoutchouc is heated slightly above the temperature of boiling water it becomes softer and loses much of its elasticity,&nbsp;which, however, it recoveres on cooling.. At about I5o°-2oo° C.&nbsp;caoutchouc melts, forming a viscous liquid which does not solidify&nbsp;on cooling. This viscous liquid is present in small proportion in&nbsp;some commercial rubbers owing to overheating during their preparation. It appears to be the principal cause of stickiness or the&nbsp;tacky ” condition of some rubbers, which considerably depreciates&nbsp;their commercial value. There is some evidence that &quot; tackiness ”&nbsp;may be induced by a kind of fermentation which takes place in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">crude rubber.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At higher temperatures the viscous, liquid suffers decomposition with the formation of various liquid hydrocarbons, principally&nbsp;members of the terpene series. Similar products are also formed&nbsp;by heating gutta-percha which closely resembles caoutchouc in&nbsp;its chemical structure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubber slowly absorbs oxygen when exposed to air and light, the absorption of oxygen being accompanied by a gradual change&nbsp;in the characteristic properties of rubber, and ultimately to the&nbsp;production of a hard, inelastic, brittle substance containing oxygen.&nbsp;Ozone at once attacks rubber, rapidly destroying it. If ozone is&nbsp;passed into, a solution of rubber in chloroform the caoutchouc&nbsp;combines with a molecule of ozone forming a compound of the&nbsp;empirical composition CcHgOj. When this compound is acted on&nbsp;by water, hydrogen peroxide and levulinic aldehyde are formed,&nbsp;the aldehyde being subsequently oxidized by the hydrogen peroxide,&nbsp;forming levulinic acid. The hydrocarbon of gutta-percha yields&nbsp;similar results and is therefore closely related to caoutchouc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The study of the action of, ozone on caoutchouc has thrown new light on the complex question of the chemical structure of this&nbsp;substance, and discloses relationships with the sugars and other&nbsp;carbohydrates from certain of which levulinic acid is obtained by&nbsp;oxidation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Caoutchouc, like other ** unsaturated ” molecules, forms compounds with chlorine, bromine, iodine and sulphur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Commercial Treatment of Rubber,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the industrial working </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">indiarubber, the various impurities present in the crude “ wild <sup>r</sup> rubber (bark, dirt and the principal&nbsp;impurities derived from the latex, except resin) are removed by the&nbsp;following process: The lumps of crude caoutchouc are first softened&nbsp;by the prolonged action of hot water, and then cut into slices&nbsp;by means of a sharp knife—generally by hand, as thus any large&nbsp;stones or other foreign substances can be removed. The softened&nbsp;slices are now repeatedly passed between grooved rollers, known</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">as washing rollers (fig. 8), a supply </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">hot or cold water being made to flow over them. Solid impurities speedily become&nbsp;crushed, and are carried away by the water, while the rubber&nbsp;takes the form of an irregular sheet perforated by numerous&nbsp;holes. The.loss on washing ranges from 10-15 % with “ fine Para ”&nbsp;to 4.0 .% with other “ wild ” rubbers. In the future this washing&nbsp;of wild ” rubber may be conducted in the tropics, thus furnishing&nbsp;the manufacturer with rubber which, like “ plantation ” rubber,&nbsp;need not be subjected to this process in the factory. The washed&nbsp;product contains in its pores a notable proportion of water, which&nbsp;is removed by hanging the rubber for some days in a warm room.&nbsp;It is now ready either for incorporation with sulphur and other&nbsp;materials, or for agglomeration into solid masses by means of the&nbsp;masticating machine—an apparatus which consists of a strong&nbsp;cylindrical cast-iron casing, inside which there revolves a metal&nbsp;cylinder with a fluted or corrugated surface. Some of the rubber&nbsp;having been placed in the annular space between the inner cylinder&nbsp;and the outer casing, the former is made to revolve; and the&nbsp;continued kneading action to .which the rubber is subjected works&nbsp;it into a solid mass, something like a gigantic sausage. Before&nbsp;commencing the mastication it is generally necessary to warm the&nbsp;apparatus by means of steam; but as the operation proceeds the&nbsp;heat produced requires to be moderated by streams of cold watej&nbsp;flowing through channels provided for the purpose.. The inner&nbsp;cylinder is generally placed somewhat excentrically in the outer&nbsp;casing,, in order to render the kneading more perfect than would&nbsp;otherwise be the case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To convert the masticated rubber into rectangular blocks, it is first softened by heat, and then forced into iron boxes or moulds.&nbsp;The blocks are cut into thin sheets by means of a sharp knife, which&nbsp;is caused to. move to and fro about two thousand times per minute,&nbsp;the knife being kept moistened with water, and the block fed up to it&nbsp;by mechanical means. Cut sheets are largely used for the fabrication of certain classes of rubber goods—these being made by&nbsp;cementing the sheets together with a solution of rubber in&quot;naphtha&nbsp;or benzol. Most articles made of cut sheet rubber would, however,&nbsp;be of very limited utility were they not hardened or vulcanized by&nbsp;the action, of sulphur or some compound of that element. After&nbsp;vulcanization, rubber is no longer softened by a moderate heat, a&nbsp;temperature of 160° C. scarcely affecting it, nor is it rendered rigid&nbsp;by cold, and the ordinary solvents fail to dissolve it. It must,&nbsp;however, be distinctly understood that it is not the mere admixture&nbsp;but the actual combination of sulphur with indiarubber that causes&nbsp;vulcanization. If an article made of cut sheet be immersed for a&nbsp;few minutes in a bath of melted sulphur, maintained at a temperature of 120<sup>0</sup> C., the rubber absorbs about one-tenth of its weight of&nbsp;that element, and, although somewhat yellowdsh in colour from the&nbsp;presence of free sulphur, it is still unvulcanized, and unaltered as&nbsp;regards general properties. If, however, it be now subjected for an&nbsp;hour or so to a terqperature of 140° C., a combination occurs, and&nbsp;vulcanized caoutchouc is the result. When a manufactured article&nbsp;has been saturated with sulphur in the melted sulphur bath,.the&nbsp;heat necessary for vulcanization may be obtained, either by high-pressure steam, by heated glycerin, or by immersion in a sulphur&nbsp;bath heated to. about 140° C. In this last case absorption of the&nbsp;sulphur and its intimate combination with the rubber occur&nbsp;simultaneously. Cut sheets, or articles made from them, may be</span></p>
