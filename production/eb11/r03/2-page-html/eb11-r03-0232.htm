<p><span class="font0">operation. But neither exhibits in any considerable degree the element of the marvellous, or the religious element, and the love&nbsp;interest itself is, even in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Horn,</span><span class="font0"> simple and not very dramatically&nbsp;or passionately worked out. In the later </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roman Paventtires<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;which the 13th century was so prolific (such as, to give one&nbsp;example out of many, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amadas and Idoine),</span><span class="font0"> these elements&nbsp;appear fully, and so they do in the great Auchinleck collection&nbsp;in English, which, though dating well within the 14th, evidently&nbsp;represents the meditation and adaptation of French examples&nbsp;for many years earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The last of our divisions, however, exhibits the whole body of romantic elements as nothing else docs. It is not our business&nbsp;in this place to deal with the Arthurian legend generally as&nbsp;regards origin, contents, &amp;c., nor, in the present division of this&nbsp;actual article, to look at it except for a special purpose and in&nbsp;connexion with and contradistinction to the other groups just&nbsp;surveyed. Here, however, we at last find all the elements of&nbsp;romance, thoroughly mixed and thoroughly at home, with the&nbsp;result not merely that the actual story becomes immensely&nbsp;popular and widely spread; not only that it receives the&nbsp;greatest actual development of any romantic theme; but that,&nbsp;in a curious fashion, it attracts to itself great numbers of practically independent stories—in not a few cases probably quite&nbsp;independent at first—which seem afraid to present themselves&nbsp;without some tacking on (it may be of the loosest and most&nbsp;accidental description) to the great </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">polycentric</span><span class="font0"> cycle, thê stages&nbsp;of which gather round Merlin, the Round Table, the Grail and&nbsp;the Guinevere-Lancelot-Mordred catastrophe. All the elements,&nbsp;let it be repeated, are here present: war, love and religion;&nbsp;the characteristic extension of subject in desultory adventure-chronicles; the typical rather than individual character (though&nbsp;the strong individuality of some of the unknown or half-known&nbsp;contributors sometimes surmounts this); the admixture of the&nbsp;marvellous, not merely though mainly as part of the religious&nbsp;element; the presence of the chivalrous ideal. The strong&nbsp;dramatic interest of the central story is rather superadded to&nbsp;than definitely evolved from thèse elements; but they are&nbsp;still present, just as, though more powerfully than, in the&nbsp;weakest of miscellaneous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">romans Paventures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A further step in the logical and historical exploration of romance may be taken by regarding the character-and-story&nbsp;classes round which it instinctively groups itself,&nbsp;and which from the intense community of medieval&nbsp;literature—the habit of medieval writers not so much&nbsp;to plagiarize from one another as to take up each after each the&nbsp;materials and the instruments which were not the property of&nbsp;any—is here especially observable. Prominent above everything is the world-old motive of the quest; which, world-old&nbsp;as it is, here acquires a predominance that it has never held&nbsp;before or since. The object takes pretty various, though not&nbsp;quite infinitely various, forms, from the rights of the disinherited heir and the hand or the favour of the heroine, to&nbsp;individual things which may themselves vary from the Holy&nbsp;Grail to so many hairs of a sultan’s beard. It may be a&nbsp;friendly knight who is lost in adventure, or a felon knight who&nbsp;has to be punished for his trespasses; a spell of some kind to&nbsp;be laid; a monster to be exterminated; an injured virgin, or&nbsp;lady, or an infirm potentate, to be succoured or avenged;&nbsp;an evil custom to be put an end to; or simply some definite&nbsp;adventure or exploit to be achieved. But quest of some sort&nbsp;there must almost certainly be if (as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sir Launfal,</span><span class="font0"> for instance)&nbsp;it is but the recovery of a love forfeited by misbehaviour or&nbsp;mishap. It is almost a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sine qua non—</span><span class="font0">the present writer,&nbsp;thinking over scores, nay hundreds, of romances, cannot at the&nbsp;moment remember one where it is wanting in some form or</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">another.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will be observed that this at once provides the amplest opportunity for the desultory concatenation or congregation&nbsp;of incident and episode which is of the very essence&nbsp;of romance. Often, nay generally, the conditions,&nbsp;localities and other circumstances of the quest are half&nbsp;known, or all but unknown, to the knight, and he is sometimes</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">intentionally led astray, always liable to be incidentally called off by interim adventures. In many (perhaps most) cases the love&nbsp;interest is directly connected with the. quest, though it may be&nbsp;in the way of hindrance as well as of furtherance or reward.&nbsp;The war interest always is so connected; and the religious&nbsp;interest commonly—almost universally in fact—is an inseparable accident. But everything leads up to, involves,&nbsp;eventuates in the fighting. The quest, if not always a directly&nbsp;warlike one, always involves war; and the endless battles&nbsp;have at all times, since they ceased to be the great attraction,&nbsp;continued to be the great obloquy of romance. It is possible&nbsp;no doubt that reports of tournaments and single combats&nbsp;with lance and sword, mace and battle-axe, may be as tedious&nbsp;to some people as reports of football matches certainly are to&nbsp;others. It is certain that the former were as satisfactory&nbsp;in former times to their own admirers as the latter are now.&nbsp;In fact the variety of incident is almost*as remarkable as the&nbsp;samëness. And the same may be said, with even greater&nbsp;confidence, of the adventures between the fights in castle&nbsp;and church and monastery, in homestead or hermitage. The&nbsp;actual stories are not much more alike than those who have&nbsp;read large numbers of modem novels critically know to be&nbsp;the case with them. But the absence, save in rare cases, of&nbsp;the element of character, and the very small presence of that&nbsp;of conversation, show up the sameness that exists in the earlier&nbsp;case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This same deficiency in individual character-drawing, and in the conversation which is one of its principal instruments,&nbsp;brings out in somewhat unfair relief some other&nbsp;cases of apparent sameness—the “ common forms ”&nbsp;of story and of character itself. The disinherited heir,&nbsp;the unfaithful or wronged wife, the wicked stepmother, the&nbsp;jealous or wrongly suspected lover, are just as universal in&nbsp;modem fiction as they are in medieval—for the simple&nbsp;reason that they are common if not universal in nature.&nbsp;But the skeleton is more obvious because it is less clothed&nbsp;with flesh and garments over the flesh; the texture of the&nbsp;canvas shows more because it is less worked upon. Some of&nbsp;these common forms, however, are more peculiar to medieval&nbsp;times; and some, though not many, allow excursions into&nbsp;abnormalities which, until recently, were tabooed to the&nbsp;modem novelist. Among the former the wickedness of the&nbsp;steward is remarkable, and of course not difficult to account&nbsp;for. The steward or seneschal of romance, with some honourable exceptions, is as wicked as the baronet of a novel, but&nbsp;here the explanation is not metaphysical. He was constantly&nbsp;left in charge in the absence of his lord and so was exposed&nbsp;to temptation. The extreme and almost Ephesian consolable-ness of the romance widow can be equally rationalized—and&nbsp;in.fact is so in the stories themselves—by the danger of the&nbsp;fief being resumed or usurped in the absence of a male tenant&nbsp;who can maintain authority and discharge duties. While&nbsp;such themes as the usually ignorant incest of son with mother&nbsp;or the more deliberate passion of father for daughter come&nbsp;mostly from very popular early examples—the legend of&nbsp;St Gregory of the Rock or the story of Apollonius of Tyre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The last point brings us naturally to another of considerable importance—the singular </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">purity</span><span class="font0"> of the romances as a whole,&nbsp;if not entirely in atmosphere and situation, yet in&nbsp;language and in external treatment. It suited the&nbsp;purposes of the Protestant controversialists of the&nbsp;Renaissance, such as our own Ascham, to throw&nbsp;discredit upon work so intimately connected with Catholic&nbsp;ceremony and belief as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morte PArihur',</span><span class="font0"> and it is certain&nbsp;that the knights of romance did not even take the benefit of&nbsp;that liberal doctrine of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cursor Mundi</span><span class="font0"> which regards even&nbsp;illicit love as not mortal unless it be “ with spouse or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sib P&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">But if in the romances such love is portrayed freely, and with&nbsp;a certain sympathy, it is never spoken of lightly and is always&nbsp;punished; nor are the pictures of it ever coarsely drawrn. In&nbsp;a very wide reading of romance the present writer does not&nbsp;remember more than two or three passages of romance proper</span></p>
