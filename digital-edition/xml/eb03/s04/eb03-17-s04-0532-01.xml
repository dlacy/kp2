carried on at preſent by the merchants of Europe with the natives of Africa. It is well known that the Portugueſe were the firſt Europeans who embarked in this trade, and that their example was ſoon followed by the Dutch and the Engliſh. Of the riſe and progreſs of the Engliſh commerce in ſlaves, the reader will find a ſufficient account in other articles oſ this work<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* See Company, vol. p. 225. and Guinea.</p></note> *. That commerce, though long cherished by the government as a ſource of national and colonial wealth, was from its commencement conſidered by the thinking part of the nation as a traffic inconſiſtent with the rights of man, and ſuspected to be carried on by acts of violence. Theſe ſuſpicions have been gradually ſpread through the people at large, and conſirmed, in many inſtances, by evidence incontrovertible. Laws have in conſequence been enacted to make the negroes more comfortable on what is called the middle passage, and to protect them againſt the wanton cruelty of their masters in the West Indies : but the humanity of the nation was rouſed ; and not many years ago a number of gentlemen, of the moſt reſpectable characters, finding that no adequate protection can be afforded to perſons in a ſtate of hopeleſs ſervitude, formed themſelves into a ſociety at London, for the purpoſe of procuring a total abolition of the ſlave-trade. That the motives which influence the leading men of this ſociety are of the pureſt kind, cannot, we think, be queſtioned ; for their object is to deliver thoſe who had none to help them, and from whom they can expect no other reward for their labours of love than the bleſſings of them who are ready to periſh. To a cauſe ſo truly Chriſtian, who would not pray for ſucceſs ? or who but muſt feel the moſt pungent regret, if that ſucceſs has been rendered doubtful, or even been delayed, by the imprudence of ſome of the agents employed by the ſociety ? This we apprehend to have been really the caſe. Language calculated only to exaſperate the planters cannot ſerve the negroes ; and the legislature of Great Britain will never ſuffer itſelf to be forced into any meaſure by the menaces oſ individuals.</p><p>In the year 1793, petitions were preſented to parliament for the abolition of this inhuman traffic, which gave a pleaſing picture of the philanthropy of the nation ; but, unfortunately for the cauſe of freedom, it was diſcovered that many of the names ſubjoined to thoſe petitions had been collected by means not the moſt honourable. This diſcovery, perhaps, would never have been made, had not the inſulting epithets indiſcriminately heaped upon the ſlave-holders provoked thoſe men to watch with circumſpection over the conduct of their opponents. The conſequence was, that ſuſpicions of unfair dealing on the part of the petitioners were ex-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0539.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0533"/>
cited in the breaſts of many who, though they ardently wiſhed well to the cauſe, choſe not to add their names to thoſe of ſchool-boys under age, and of peaſants who knew not what they were ſubrcribing. Let the rights of the Africans be maintained with ardour and firmneſs ; but never let their advocates ſuppoſe that the cauſe of humanity requires the ſupport of artifice. Abſolute ſlavery, in which the actions of one man are regulated by the caprice of another, is a ſtate demonſtrably inconſiſtent with the obvious plan of the moral government of the world. It degrades the mental faculties of the ſlave, and throws, both in his way and in his maſter’s, temptations to vice almoſt inſurmountable. Let theſe truths be ſet in a proper light by thoſe who have doubtleſs ſeen them exemplified ; and they will ſurely have their full effect on the minds of a generous, and, we truſt, not yet an impious people<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Asiatic searches, vol. ii.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(n).</hi> The trade will be gradually aboliſhed ; pains will be taken to cultivate the minds of the West Indian negroes; and the era may be at no great diſtance when ſlavery ſhall ceaſe through all the Britiſh dominions.</p><p>But what benefit, it will be aſked, would the negroes of Africa reap from an abolition of the ſlave trade ? Should any thing ſo wildly incredible happen, as that all the nations of Chriſtendom, in one common paroxyſm of philanthropy, ſhould abandon this commerce in ſervants, which has been proſecuted in all ages, and under all religions ; they would only abandon it to thoſe who were originally posseſſed of it, who ſtill penetrate into the country, and who even puſh up to Gago at the very head oſ the ſlave coaſt ; and leave the wool-headed natives of it to Mahometan maſters, in preference to Chriſtian. Under ſuch maſters they were in Judea at the time of the cruſades. Under ſuch, as we learn from Meffrs Saugnier, Briſſon, and others, they ſtill are in the deſerts of Africa, as well as in the iſlands of Johanna<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Essay on colonization.</p></note> * and Madagaſcar: and it is univerſally known that they enſlave one another as a puniſhment for the moſt whimſical crimes. Among them, indeed, ſlavery ſeems to be reduced to a ſyſtem, and to deſcend, as it has done in more poliſhed nations, from father to ſon ; for both Saugnier and Wadſtrom<note anchored="true" n="4" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Dalzel's History.</p></note> * ſpeak of particular families of negroes who are exempted from that degrading ſtate by the laws of the country.</p><p>All this we admit to be true. Moſt certainly the negroes would not be exempted from the miſeries of ſervitude, though Europe and the West Indies were</p><p>swallowed up in the ocean. The <hi rend="italic">customs</hi> of the country, as the king of Dahomy aſſured Mr Abſon<note anchored="true" n="5" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Ramsay's Essay, p. 292, &amp;c.</p></note> *, will be <hi rend="italic">made</hi> as long as black men ſhall continue to poſſeſs their own territories, in their preſent ſtate of depravity and ignorance ; and theſe cuſtoms appear to involve ſlavery of the cruelleſt kind. But if ſlavery be in itſelf unlawful, is it a ſufficient excuſe for our continuing the traffic that it is carried on by the rude negroes and the ſavage Arabs? Are people, whom we ſometimes affect to conſider as an inferior order of beings, to furniſh examples of conduct to thoſe who boaſt of their advancements in ſcience, in literature, and in refinement ? Or will the benevolent Lord of all things pardon us for oppreſſing our helpleſs brethren, merely becauſe they are cruelly oppreſſed by others ? It is indeed true that the natives of Guinea cannot be made really free but by introducing among them the bleſſings of religion and the arts of civil life ; but ſurely they would have fewer temptations than at preſent to kidnap one another, or to commence unprovoked wars for the purpoſe of making captives, were the nations of Europe to abandon the commerce in ſlaves<note anchored="true" n="6" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(n)</hi> We have not inſiſted upon the impolicy of the ſlave-trade, or endeavoured to prove that its abolition would be <hi rend="italic">advantageous</hi> to the ſugar-planters ; for the planters ſurely underſtand their own intereſt better than thoſe can do, who, having never been in the West Indies, are obliged to content themſelves with what information they can glean on the ſubject from a number of violent and contradictory publications. To countenance ſlavery under any form is undoubtedly immoral. This we know : and therefore upon this ground only have we oppoſed the ſlave-trade, which cannot be continued without preferring intereſt to virtue.</p></note> (o). That commerce, we grant, would be continued by the Arabs, and perhaps by others of the eaſtern nations ; but the ſame number of people could not be carried off by them alone that is now carried off both by them and by the Europeans.</p><p>Were it indeed poſſible to put the ſlave-trade under proper regulations, ſo as to prevent all kidnapping and unjuſt wars among the Africans, to ſupply the markets ; and were it likewiſe to enſure to the negroes in the West Indies mild treatment and religious inſtruction ; we are far from being ſure that while the natives of Guinea continue ſo rude, and their neighbours the Arabs ſo ſelfiſhly ſavage, it would be proper to abandon at once to hordes of barbarians the whole of this commerce in bond ſervants. “ The trade, which in its preſent form is a reproach to Britain, might be made to take a new ſhape, and become ultimately a bleſſing to thouſands of wretches who, left in their native country, would have dragged out a life of miſerable ignorance, unknowing the hand that framed them, unconscious of the reaſon of which they were made capable, and heedleſs of the happineſs laid up for them in ſtore<note anchored="true" n="7" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(o) In a ſpeech which Mr Dalzel ſays the king of Dahomy made to Mr Abſon, when he was informed of what had paſſed in England on the ſubject of the ſlave-trade, are theſe remarkable words : “ In the name of my anceſtors and myself, I aver that no Dahoman ever embarked in war merely for the ſake of procuring wherewithal to purchaſe your commodities.” With all due reſpect ſor his fable majeſty, we muſt take the liberty to queſtion the truth of this ſolemn averment. That the ſlave-trade is not the so <hi rend="italic">le</hi> cauſe of the Dahoman wars every man will admit, who does not fancy that thoſe people have neither paſſions nor appetites, but for the commodities of Europe : but the bare affirmation of this bloody deſpot, who boaſted of having killed many thouſands at the <hi rend="italic">customs,</hi> will not convince thoſe who have read either Wadſtrom’s Essay on Colonization, or the evidence reſpecting the ſlave-trade given at the bar oſ the Houſe of Commons, “ that no Dahoman ever embarked in war merely to procure ſlaves to barter for European commodities."</p></note> *.</p><p>Slavery is, indeed, in every form an evil; but it ſeems to be one of thoſe many evils which, having long prevailed in the world, can be advantageouſly removed only by degrees, and as the moral cultivation of the ſlaves<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0540.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0534"/>
may enable them to ſupport the rank and diſcharge the duties of free men. This is doubtleſs the reaſon why it was not expreſsly prohibited by the divine Author of our religion, but ſuffered to vaniſh gradually before the mild influence of his Heavenly doctrines. It has vanished before theſe doctrines in moſt countries of Europe ; and we truſt that the time is at hand when our traffic in human fleſh with the inhabitants of Africa ſhall ceaſe ; and that the period is not very diſtant when the ſlaves in the West Indies ſhall be ſo much improved in moral and religious knowledge, as that they may be lately truſted with their own freedom. To ſet them free in their preſent ſtate of ignorance and depravity, is one of the wildeſt propoſals that the ardour of innovation has ever made. Such freedom would be equally ruinous to themſelves and to their maſters ; and we may say of it what Cicero ſaid of ſome unſeaſonable indulgences propoſed to be granted to the ſlaves in Sicily ; Quae <hi rend="italic">cum accidunt, nemo eſt, quin intelligat ruere illam rempublicam ; haec ubi veniunt, nemo est, qui ullam ſpem ſalutis reliquam eſſe arbitretur.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
