(Thomas), D. D. the intimate friend of Dean Swift, is ſaid by Shield, in Cibber’s “ Lives of the Poets,” to have been born about 1684, in the county of Cavan, where, according to the ſame authority, his parents lived in no very elevated ſtate. They are deſcribed as being unable to afford their ſon the advantages of a liberal education; but he, being obſerved to give early indications of genius, attracted the notice of a friend to his family, who font him to the college of Dublin, and contributed towards his ſupport while he remained there. He aftewards entered into orders, and ſet up a ſchool in Dublin, which long maintained a very high degree of reputation, as well for the attention beſtowed on the morals of the ſcholars as for their proficiency in literature. So great was the eſtimation in which this ſeminary was held, that it is aſſerted to have produced in some years the ſum of L. 1000. It does not appear that he had any conſiderable preferment ; but his intimacy with Swift, in 1725, procured for him a living in the south of Ireland worth about L. 150 a-year, which he went to take poſſeſſion of, and, by an act of inadvertence, deſtroyed all his future expectations of riling in the church ; for being at Corke on the 1st of Auguſt, the anniverſary of King George’s birth-day, he preached a ſermon, which had for its text, “ Sufficient for the day is the evil thereof.” On this being known, he was ſtruck out of the list of chaplains to the lord lieutenant, and forbidden the castle.</p><p>This living Dr Sheridan afterwards changed for that of Dunboyne, which, by the knavery of the farmers, and power of the gentlemen in the neighbourhood, fell so low as L. 80 <hi rend="italic">per annum.</hi> He gave it up for the free ſchool of Cavan, where he might have lived well in so cheap a country on L. 80 a-year ſalary, beſides his ſcholars ; but the air being, as he ſaid, too moiſt and unwholesome, and being diſguſted with some perſons who lived there, he fold the ſchool for about L. 400 ; and having ſoon ſpent the money, he fell into bad health, and died Sept. 10. 1738, in his 55th year.</p><p>Lord Corke has given the following character of him : “ Dr Sheridan was a ſchool-maſter, and in many inſtances perfectly well adapted for that ſtation. He was deeply verſed in the Greek and Roman languages, and in their cuſtoms and antiquities. He had that kind of good nature which abſence of mind, indolence of body, and careleſſneſs of fortune, produce ; and although not over ſtrict in his own conduct, yet he took care of the morality of his ſcholars, whom he font to the university remarkably well founded in all kinds of claſſical learning, and not ill inſtructed in the ſocial duties of life. He was ſlovenly, indigent, and cheerful. He knew books much better than men ; and he knew the value of money leaſt of all. In this ſituation, and with this diſpoſition, Swift faſtened upon him as upon a prey with which he intended to regale himſelf whenever his appetite ſhould prompt him.” His Lordſhip then mentions the event of the unlucky ſermon, and adds : “ This ill-ſtarred, good-natured, improvident man, returned to Dublin, unhinged from all favour at court, and even baniſhed from the castle. But still he remained a punſter, a quibbler, a fiddler, and a wit. Not a<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0365.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0359"/>
day paſſed without a rebus, an anagram, or a madrigal. His pen and his fiddleſtick were in continual motion ; and yet to little or no purpoſe, if we may give credit to the following verſes, which ſhall ſerve as the concluſion of his poetical character :</p><p>“ With muſic and poetry equally bleſs’d,</p><p>“ A bard thus Apollo most humbly addreſs’d ;</p><p>“ Great author of poetry, muſic, and light,</p><p>“ Inſtructed by thee, I both fiddle and write ;</p><p>“ Yet unheeded I ſcrape, or I ſcribble all day,</p><p>My tunes are neglected, my verſe flung away.</p><p>“ Thy ſubſtitute here, Vice-Apollo diſdains</p><p>“ To vouch for my numbers, or lift to my ſtrains.</p><p>“ Thy manual ſign he refuſes to put</p><p>To the airs I produce from the pen or the gut :</p><p>“ Be thou then propitious, great Phœbus, and grant</p><p>“ Relief, or reward, to my merit or want.</p><p>“ Tho’ the Dean and Delany tranſeendently ſhine,</p><p>“ O ! brighten one ſolo or ſonnet of mine :</p><p>“ Make one work immortal, ’tis all I requeſt.</p><p>“ Apollo look’d pleas’d, and reſolving to jeſt,</p><p>“ Replied — Honest friend, I’ve consider’d your caſe,</p><p>" Nor diſlike your unmeaning and innocent face.</p><p>“ Your petition I grant, the boon is not great,</p><p>“ Your works ſhall continue, and here’s the receipt, “ On rondeaus hereafter your fiddle-ſtrings ſpend,</p><p>“ Write verſes in circles, they never ſhall end.”</p><p>“ One of the volumes of Swift’s miſcellanies conſiſts almoſt entirely of letters between him and the Dean. He publiſhed a proſe tranſlation of Perſius ; to which he added the best notes of former editors, together with many judicious ones of his own. This work was printed at London, 1739, in 12mo. <hi rend="italic">Biographical Dictionary.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sheridan</hi> (Mrs Frances), wife to Thomas Sheridan, M. A. was born in Ireland about the year 1724, but deſcended from a good Engliſh family which had removed thither. Her maiden name was Chamberlaine, and ſhe was grand-daughter of Sir Oliver Chamberlaine. The firſt literary performance by which ſhe diſtinguiſhed herſelf was a little pamphlet at the time of a violent party-diſpute relative to the theatre, in which Mr Sheridan had newly embarked his fortune. So well-timed a work exciting the attention of Mr Sheridan, he by an accident diſcovered his fair patroneſs, to whom he was ſoon afterwards married. She was a perſon of the moſt amiable character in every relation of life, with the most engaging manners. After lingering ſome years in a very weak ſtate of health, ſhe died at Blois, in the south of France, in the year 1767. Her “ Sydney Biddulph” may be ranked with the firſt productions of that claſs in ours or in any other language. She alſo wrote a little romance in one volume called <hi rend="italic">Nourjahad,</hi> in which there is a great deal of imagination productive of an admirable moral. And ſhe was the authoreſs of two comedies, “ The Diſcovery” and “ The Dupe.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
