<p><span class="font0">friendship and said: “ These terrible strangers have taken our country, and to-morrow they will take yours if you do not come&nbsp;and help us.” In response to this call some Russian princes&nbsp;formed a league and went out eastward to meet the foe, but they&nbsp;were utterly defeated in a great battle on the banks of the&nbsp;Kalka (1224), which has remained to this day in the memory&nbsp;of the Russian common people. Now the country was at the&nbsp;mercy of the invaders, but, instead of advancing, they suddenly&nbsp;retreated and did not reappear for thirteen years, during which&nbsp;the princes went on quarrelling and fighting as before, till they&nbsp;were startled by a new invasion much more formidable than&nbsp;its predecessor. This time the invaders came to stay, and they&nbsp;built for themselves a capital, called Sarai, on the lower Volga.&nbsp;Here the commander of “ the Golden Horde,” as the western&nbsp;section of the Mongol empire was called, fixed his&nbsp;headquarters and represented the majesty of his&nbsp;sovereign the grand khan who lived w*ith the Great</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Horde in the valley of the Amur. About the origin and character of these terrible invaders we are much better informed than the early Russian chroniclers. The nucleus of&nbsp;the invading horde was a small pastoral tribe in Mongolia, the&nbsp;chief of which, known subsequently to Europe as Jenghiz&nbsp;Khan (g.t&gt;.), became a mighty conqueror and created a vast&nbsp;empire stretching from China, across northern and central&nbsp;Asia, to the shores of the Baltic and the valley of the Danube&nbsp;—a heterogeneous state containing many nationalities held&nbsp;together by purely administrative ties and by an enormous&nbsp;military force. For forty years after the death of its founder&nbsp;it remained united under the authority of a series of grand khans&nbsp;chosen from among his descendants, and then it began to fall to&nbsp;pieces till the various fractions of it became independent khanates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The khanate closely connected with the history of Russia was that of Kipchak or the Golden Horde, the khans of which&nbsp;settled, as we have seen, on the lower Volga and built for themselves a capital called Sarai. Here they had their headquarters&nbsp;and held Russia in subjection for nearly three centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The term by which this subjection is commonly designated, the Mongol or Tatar yoke, suggests ideas of terrible oppression,&nbsp;but in reality these barbarous invaders from the Far&nbsp;East were not such cruel, oppressive taskmasters as&nbsp;is generally supposed. In the first place, they never&nbsp;settled in the country, and they had not much direct dealings with the inhabitants. In accordance with the admonitions of Jenghiz to his children and grandchildren, they&nbsp;retained their pastoral mode of life, so that the subject races,&nbsp;agriculturists and dwellers in towns, were not disturbed in their&nbsp;ordinary avocations. In religious matters they were extremely&nbsp;tolerant. When they first appeared in Europe they were&nbsp;idolaters or Shamanists, and as such they had naturally no&nbsp;religious fanaticism; but even when they adopted Islam they&nbsp;remained as tolerant as before, and the khan of the Golden&nbsp;Horde (Berkai) who first became a Mussulman allowed the&nbsp;Russians to found a Christian bishopric in his capital. One of&nbsp;his successors, half a century later, married a daughter of the&nbsp;Byzantine emperor, and gave his own daughter in marriage to a&nbsp;Russian prince. These represent the bright side of Tatar rule. It&nbsp;had its dark side also. So long as a great horde of nomads was&nbsp;encamped on the frontier the country was liable to be invaded&nbsp;by an overwhelming force of ruthless marauders. These invasions were fortunately not frequent, but when they occurred&nbsp;they caused an incalculable amount of devastation and suffering.&nbsp;In the intervals the people had to pay a fixed tribute. At first&nbsp;it was collected in a rough-and-ready fashion by a swarm of&nbsp;Tatar tax-gatherers, but about 1259 it was regulated by a census&nbsp;of the population, and, finally, the collection of it was entrusted&nbsp;to the native princes, so that the people were no longer brought</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">into direct contact with the Tatar officials.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the princes the “ yoke ” was felt more keenly, and it was very galling. In order to reply to accusations brought&nbsp;against them, or in order to be confirmed in their function^,&nbsp;they had to travel to the Golden Horde on the Volga or even&nbsp;to the camp of the grand khan in some distant part of Siberia,&nbsp;and the journey was considered so perilous that many of them,&nbsp;before settijg out, made their last will and testament and wrote&nbsp;a parental admonition for the guidance of their children. Nor&nbsp;were these precautions by any means superfluous, for not a few&nbsp;princes died on the journey or were condemned to death and&nbsp;executed for real or imaginary offences. Even when the visit&nbsp;to the Horde did not ¿nd so tragically, it involved a great deal of&nbsp;anxiety and expense, for the Mongol dignitaries had to be conciliated very liberally, and it was commonly believed that the&nbsp;judges were more influenced by the amount of the bribes than&nbsp;by the force of the arguments. The grand khan was the lord&nbsp;paramount or suzerain of the Russian princes, and he had the&nbsp;force required for making his authority respected. Ambitious&nbsp;members of the Rurik dynasty, instead of seeking to acquire&nbsp;territory by conquest in the field, now sought to attain their&nbsp;ends by intrigue and bribery at the Mongol court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of all the princes who sought to advance their fortunes in this way the most dexterous and successful were those of Moscow.&nbsp;They made themselves responsible for the tribute of&nbsp;other principalities as well as of their own, and gradually they became lieutenants-general of their Mongol&nbsp;suzerain. So long as the Mongol empire remained&nbsp;united and strong, they were most submissive and&nbsp;obsequious, but as soon as it was weakened by internal&nbsp;dissensions and began to fall to pieces, they assumed airs&nbsp;of independence, intrigued with the insubordinate Tatar&nbsp;generals, retained for their own use the tribute collected for&nbsp;the grand khan, and finally put themselves at the head of the&nbsp;patriotic movement which aimed at throwing .off completely the&nbsp;hated Mongol yoke. For this purpose Dimitri Donskoi formed&nbsp;in 1380 a coalition of Russian princes, and gained a great victory&nbsp;over Khan Mamai of the Golden Horde on the famous battlefield of Kulikovo, the memory of which still lives in the popular&nbsp;legends. For some time longer the Tatars remained troublesome&nbsp;neighbours, capable of invading and devastating large tracts of&nbsp;Russian territory and of threatening even the city of Moscow,&nbsp;but the Horde was now broken up into independent and&nbsp;mutually hostile khanates, and the Moscow diplomatists could&nbsp;generally play off one khanate against the other, so that there&nbsp;was no danger of the old political domination being re-established.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having thus freed themselves from Tatar control, the Moscow princes continued to carry out energetically their traditional&nbsp;policy of extending and consolidating their dominions at the&nbsp;expense of their less powerful relations. Already Dimitri of the&nbsp;Don was called the grand-prince of all Russia, but the assumption of such an ambitious title was hardly justified by facts,&nbsp;because there were still in his time principalities with grand-princes who claimed to be independent. The complete suppression of these small moribund states and the creation of the&nbsp;autocratic tsardom of Muscovy were the work of Ivan III.,&nbsp;surnamed the Great, his son Basil and his grandson Ivan IV.,&nbsp;commonly known as Ivan the Terrible, whose united reigns&nbsp;cover a period of 122 years (r462-1584).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">III. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Tsardom of Muscovy.—</span><span class="font0">What may be called the home policy of these three remarkable rulers consisted in absorbing&nbsp;the few principalities which still remained independent, and in creating for themselves an uncontrolled&nbsp;monarchical authority. In the pursuit of both of these&nbsp;objects they were completely successful. When Ivan III.&nbsp;came to the throne the remaining independent principalities&nbsp;were Great Novgorod, Pskov, Tver, Ryazan and Novgorod-Seversk. He first directed his attention to Novgorod, and by&nbsp;gradually undermining and then destroying the ancient republican liberties he reduced the haughty city, which had long&nbsp;styled itself Lord Novgorod the Great, to the rank of a provincial&nbsp;town. Then he annexed its colonies and thereby extended his&nbsp;dominions to the Polar Ocean and the Ural Mountains. At the&nbsp;same time he took possession of Tver, on the ground that the&nbsp;prince had allied himself with Lithuania. His successor Basil followed in his footsteps, and dealt with&nbsp;the municipal republic of Pskov Was Ivan had dealt&nbsp;with Novgorod.
