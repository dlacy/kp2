Coarse in workmanship, intensely feeble in design, and utterly without expression or life, the pagan sculpture of that time is merely a dull and ignorant imitation of the work of previous centuries. The old faith was dead, and the art which had sprung</p><p>from it died with it. In</p><p>the same century a large</p><p>amount of sculpture was</p><p>produced by Christian</p><p>workmen, which, though</p><p>it reached no very high</p><p>standard of merit, was at</p><p>least far superior to the</p><p>pagan work. Although</p><p>it shows no increase of</p><p>technical skill or know</p><p>ledge of the human form,</p><p>yet the mere fact that it</p><p>was inspired and its sub</p><p>jects supplied by a real</p><p>living faith was quite</p><p>sufficient to give it - a</p><p>vigour and a dramatic</p><p>force which raise it æs-</p><p>thetically far above the</p><p>expiring efforts of pagan</p><p>ism. Fig. I shows a very</p><p>fine Christian relief of</p><p>the 4th century, with a</p><p>noble figure of an arch</p><p>angel holding an orb and</p><p>a sceptre. It is a leaf from</p><p>an ivory consular dip</p><p>tych, inscribed at the top</p><p>ΔEXOY ΠΑΡΟΝΤΑ KAI</p><p>MAΘWN ΤΗΝ ΑΙΤΙΑΝ,</p><p>“Receive these presents</p><p>and having learnt the oc</p><p>casion ...” A number</p><p>of large marble sarco</p><p>phagi are the chief exist</p><p>ing specimens of this early</p><p>Christian sculpture. In</p><p>general design they are</p><p>close copies of pagan tombs, and are richly decorated outside with reliefs. The subjects of these are usually scenes from the Old and New Testaments. From the former those subjects were selected which were supposed to have some typical reference to the life of Christ : the Meeting of Abraham and Melchisedec, the Sacrifice of Isaac, Daniel among the Lions, Jonah and the Whale, are those which most frequently occur. Among the New Testament scenes no representations occur of Christ’s sufferings; @@1 the subjects chosen illustrate His power and beneficence : the Sermon on the Mount, the Triumphal Entry into Jerusalem, and many of His miracles are</p><p>frequently repeated. The Vatican and Lateran museums are rich in examples of this sort. One of the finest in the former collection was taken from the crypt of the old basilica of St Peter ; it contained the body of a certain Junius Bassus, and dates from the year 359. @@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> Many other similar sarcophagi were made in the provinces of Rome, especially Gaul ; and fine specimens exist in the museums of Arles, Marseilles, and Aix; those found in Britain are of very inferior workmanship.</p><p>In the 5th century other plastic works similar in style were still produced in Italy, especially reliefs in ivory (to a certain extent imitations of the later consular diptychs), which were used to decorate episcopal thrones or the bindings of MSS. of the Gospels. The so-called chair of St Peter, still preserved (though hidden from sight) in his great basilica, is the finest example of the former class ; of less purely classical style, dating from about 550, is the ivory throne of Bishop Maximianus in Ravenna cathedral (see fig. 2). Another very remarkable work of</p><p>the 5th century is the series of small panel reliefs on the doors of S. Sabina on the Aventine Hill at Rome. They are scenes from Bible history carved</p><p>in wood, and in them much of the</p><p>old classic style survives. @@<hi rend="superscript">3</hi></p><p>In the 6th century, under the Byzantine influence of Justinian, a new class of decorative sculpture was produced, especially at Ravenna. Subject reliefs do not often occur, but large slabs of marble, forming screens, altars, pulpits, and the like, were ornamented in a very skilful and original way with low reliefs of graceful vine-plants, with peacocks and other birds drinking out of chalices, all treated in a very able and highly decorative manner (see fig. 3 and the upper band of fig. 2).
