                in Cosmedin.@@<sup>1</sup> Some of its substructures, with remains of&nbsp;very
                early tufa structures on the Palatine side, still exist below the&nbsp;church of S.
                Anastasia (see 58 in fig. 17). The obelisk now in the&nbsp;Piazza del Popolo was set
                on the spina by Augustus. The Circus&nbsp;Flaminius in the Campus Martius was built
                by the C. Flaminius&nbsp;Nepos killed at Thmsymene in 217 b.c. ; remains of the
                structure&nbsp;were found in the 16th century under the Palazzo Mattel. In
                the&nbsp;Middle Ages its long open space was used as a rope-walk, hence
                the&nbsp;name of the church called S. Caterina dei Funari, which occupies&nbsp;part
                of its site.@@<sup>2</sup> The circus of Caligula and Nero was at the foot&nbsp;of

                which exist under most of the&nbsp;houses of the Piazza Navona (Agonalis), and
                especially below S.&nbsp;Agnese, is probably that built by Domitian and restored by
                Severus&nbsp;Alexander. It was called from the latter emperor the
                Stadium&nbsp;Alexandrinum. That it was a stadium and not a circus is shown&nbsp;by
                the fact that its starting end is at right angles to the sides and&nbsp;not set
                diagonally, as was always the case with the careeres of a&nbsp;circus ; nor is there
                any trace of foundations of a spina. The best&nbsp;preserved circus is that built by
                Maxentius in honour of his deified&nbsp;son Romulus, by the Via Appia, 2 miles
                outside the walls of Rome.&nbsp;Itwasattributed to Caracalla till 1825, when an

                Pompey,&nbsp;carefully concealed underground. The theatre of Marcellus is
                much&nbsp;more perfect ; complete foundations of the cunei exist under
                the&nbsp;Palazzo Savelli, and part of the external arcade is well

                has travertine&nbsp;arches with engaged columns, and the upper has brick-faced
                pilasters.&nbsp;It was built by Cornelius Balbus in 13 b.c. (Suet., </span><span

                style="font-style:italic;">(H.N.,</span><span class="font1"> xxxvi. 2, 24).&nbsp;The
                same writer mentions an almost incredible building, which&nbsp;consisted of two
                wooden theatres made to revolve on pivots, so that&nbsp;the two together made an
                amphitheatre ; this was erected by C.&nbsp;Curio in 50 b.c.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The first stone amphitheatre in Rome was that built by Statilius
                Taurus in the reign of Augustus. Its ruins are supposed to form&nbsp;the elevation
                called Monte Giordano, but none of it is visible. For&nbsp;the Colosseum see
                Amphitheatre, vol. i. The Amphitheatrum&nbsp;Castrense is in the line of the wall of
                Aurelian near tlιe Porta&nbsp;Asinaria ; it is built of concrete, faced with neat
                brickwork, and&nbsp;was decorated with friezes and other ornaments in moulded
                terracotta. Its exterior had two tiers of arches between engaged&nbsp;Corinthian
                columns, all, even the foliage of the capitals, very&nbsp;neatly executed in
                terra-cotta. Only one piece with the upper&nbsp;order still exists on the outside of
                the Aurelian line. This amphitheatre is mentioned in the regionary catalogues under
                Regio v.&nbsp;It is supposed to have been erected for the amusement of the
                troops&nbsp;in the neighbouring camp, hence its name. From the character of&nbsp;the
                brick-facing the building appears to date from the early part of&nbsp;the 2d
                century.</span></p>

        <p><span class="font1">The earliest triumphal arches were the two erected by L. Stertinius
                (196 b.c.) in the Forum Boarium and in the Circus Maximus, out&nbsp;of spoils gained
                in Spain.@@<sup>9</sup> In the later years of the empire there&nbsp;were nearly
                forty in Rome. The arch of Titus and Vespasian on&nbsp;the Summa Sacra Via was
                erected by Domitian to commemorate the&nbsp;conquest of Judæa by Titus in his
                father’s reign. Reliefs inside&nbsp;the arch represent the triumphal
                procession—Titus in a chariot,&nbsp;and on the other side soldiers bearing the
                golden candlestick,&nbsp;trumpets, and table of prothesis, taken from the Jewish
                temple.&nbsp;The central part only of this monument is original ; the sides
                were&nbsp;restored in 1823.@@<sup>1</sup>° Another arch in honour of Titus had
                previously&nbsp;been built (80 a.d.) in the Circus Maximus ; its inscription is
                given&nbsp;in the Einsiedeln MS. (Gruter, </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Inscr.,</span><span class="font1"> p. 244, No. 6). A
                plain travertine arch near the supposed palace of Commodus on the Ccelian&nbsp;is
                inscribed with the names of the consul Publius Corn. Dolabella&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font0">(10 A.D.) </span><span class="font1">and of the flamen martialis, C.
                Junius Silanus. In later&nbsp;times Nero’s aqueduct was built over it. It may
                possibly have&nbsp;been an entrance into the Campus Martialis, an enclosure on
                the&nbsp;Ctelian sacred to Mars, which was used for games when the
                Campus&nbsp;Martius was flooded. The so-called arch of Drusus by the
                Porta&nbsp;Appia also carries the specus of an aqueduct,—that built by Caracalla to
                supply his great thermæ. Its coarse details show, however, that it is much later
                than the time of Drusus (Suet., </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Claud.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1). It was usual
                to ornament specially the arch of an aqueduct&nbsp;that happened to cross a road,
                ami this arch was probably built by&nbsp;Caracalla with the rest of his branch of
                the Aqua Marcia. Adjoining the church of S. Giorgio in Velabro a rich though
                coarsely&nbsp;decorated marble gateway with flat lintel still exists,—built,
                as&nbsp;its inscription records, in honour of Severus and his sons by
                the&nbsp;argentarii (bankers and silversmiths) and other merchants of the&nbsp;Forum
                Boarium in 204. It formed an entrance from the Forum&nbsp;Boarium into the Velabrum.
                The figure of Geta in the reliefs and&nbsp;his name have been erased by Caracalla ;
                the sculpture is poor&nbsp;both in design and execution@@<sup>11</sup> (see
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bull. Insk,</span><span
                class="font1"> 1867, p. 217, and&nbsp;1871, p. 233). Close by is a quadruple arch,
                set at the intersection&nbsp;of two roads, such as was called by the Romans an arch
                of Janus&nbsp;Quadrifons. Though partly built of earlier fragments, it is of
                the&nbsp;worst style of work ; it cannot be earlier than the time of Constantine,
                and probably is of still later date. The finest existing arch is&nbsp;that by the
                Colosseum erected by Constantine. It owes, however,&nbsp;little of its beauty to
                that artistically degraded period. Not only&nbsp;most of its reliefs but its whole
                design and many of its architectural&nbsp;features were stolen from an earlier arch
                erected by Trajan as an&nbsp;entrance to his forum (see p. 826 above). The arch of
                Claudius,&nbsp;built in 43 to commemorate his supposed victories in Britain,
                stood&nbsp;across the Via Lata (modern Corso) between S. Francesco Saverio&nbsp;and

                portraits&nbsp;of him made in the reign of Hadrian (117-138) are among the most
                beautiful existing specimens of Roman or Græco-Roinan sculpture ; while after the
                accession of Severus in 193 no sculpture of any real artistic merit seems to have
                been&nbsp;produced.</span></p>
