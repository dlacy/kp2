<p><span class="font0">The typical rats and mice, together with their nearest relatives, constitute the sub-family Murinae, which is represented by more&nbsp;than three hundred species, distributed over the whole of the Old&nbsp;World except Madagascar. The molars (fig. 13, A) are rooted&nbsp;and have a plate-like structure, with the&nbsp;cusps or tubercles forming three longitudinal rows in those of the upper jaw,&nbsp;but only two distinct ones in the lower.&nbsp;By this structure the Murinac are broadly&nbsp;distinguished both from the Cricctinac&nbsp;(fig. 13. B) and the Microtinac. ln the&nbsp;skull the tympanic bulla is hollow, the&nbsp;pterygoid fossa shallow and the zygomatic&nbsp;arch slender, with a rudimentary’ jugal&nbsp;bone. The tail is long and scaly (fig. 12).&nbsp;The genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mus,</span><span class="font0"> with about a couple of&nbsp;hundred species, includes the true mice&nbsp;and rats (sec Mouse and Rat), and has&nbsp;the typical characters of the group, the&nbsp;incisors being narrow and smooth, the&nbsp;molars small, the eyes and cars large&nbsp;and the tip of the muzzle naked, ln some cases there may&nbsp;be spines among the fur. None are much larger than the&nbsp;hrown rat </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">CM. norvegicus)</span><span class="font0"> or smaller than the harvest mouse;&nbsp;and they all have habits generally similar to those of one&nbsp;or other of the English species, although some live in trees like&nbsp;squirrels, or in the water; among the latter being the brown-footed&nbsp;rat (M. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fuscipes)</span><span class="font0"> of western and southern Australia (fig. 12).&nbsp;The genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nesocia</span><span class="font0"> is like </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mus,</span><span class="font0"> but with the incisors and molars&nbsp;broader, and the transverse laminae of the latter more clearly&nbsp;defined. This genus contains a few clumsily built rats spread&nbsp;over Southern Asia from Palestine to Formosa, and from Kashmir&nbsp;to Ceylon (see Bandicoot-Rat). Among other important genera&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cricetomys</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eosaccomys</span><span class="font0"> (both African) stand apart by the&nbsp;possession of cheek-pouches: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. gambianus</span><span class="font0"> being a very large&nbsp;species. The Javan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pithechirus</span><span class="font0"> has the thumb opposable, while&nbsp;the Papuan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chirurornys</span><span class="font0"> has the tip of the tail naked abo\*e and&nbsp;prehensile. The spiny mice, /Ifowyj (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acanthomys),</span><span class="font0"> of Western&nbsp;Asia, Cyprus and Africa, take their name from the fur being almost&nbsp;entirely replaced by flattened spines, and are further distinguished&nbsp;by the rudimentary coronoid process of the lower jaw. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dasymys&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is an allied African genus; while </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arvicanthis</span><span class="font0"> includes the African&nbsp;striped mice. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Golunda,</span><span class="font0"> from India and Africa, is like </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mus,</span><span class="font0"> but&nbsp;with grooved upper incisors. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vandeleuria,</span><span class="font0"> ranging from India to&nbsp;Yunnan, has flat nails on the first and fifth toes of both feet, and&nbsp;a very long tail; while the Indo-Malay </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiropodomys</span><span class="font0"> has a flat&nbsp;nail on the first toe of both feet and a tufted tail. In the Philippines occur the peculiar genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Batomys, Carpomys</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crateromys,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">confined to the mountains of Luzon, the third remarkable for&nbsp;its huge size and long hair. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mastacomys</span><span class="font0"> is like </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mus,</span><span class="font0"> but with&nbsp;the molars remarkably broadened, and with only four teats. The&nbsp;single species is from Tasmania, though it has been found fossil&nbsp;in New South Wales; it is somewhat similar in size and appearance&nbsp;to the English water-rat, but has longer and softer fur. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uromys&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">differs from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mus</span><span class="font0"> in having the scales of the tail not overlapping,&nbsp;but set edge to edge, so as to form a sort of mosaic work. There&nbsp;are several species, spread over the northern part of the Australian&nbsp;region from the Aru islands to Queensland. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Echinothrix</span><span class="font0"> is a rat&nbsp;with an extremely elongated muzzle, all the bones of the face&nbsp;being much produced, and the incisors faintly grooved, the only&nbsp;species, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">E. leucnra,</span><span class="font0"> being about the size of the common rat, with&nbsp;its fur thickly mixed with spines, a native of Celebes., Australia&nbsp;is the home of the group of jumping species, known as jerboa-rats,&nbsp;characterized by the elongation of the hind limbs, arranged under&nbsp;the genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Notomys, Dipodillus, Ammomys</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Conilurus,</span><span class="font0"> distinguished from one another by the structure of the molars and the&nbsp;number of teats and foot-pads, the second being further character</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ized by its long ears.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The large-eared African </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Otomysand</span><span class="font0"> the allied </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oreomys (Oreinomys), </span><span class="font0">often made the type of a distinct sub-family, may be included in&nbsp;this section; as well as the small African tree-mice, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dendromys,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">allied to which is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deomys,</span><span class="font0"> peculiar in the circumstance that only&nbsp;the first molar has three rows of cusps, the other two having only&nbsp;a couple of such rows, as in cricetines. Other allied African genera&nbsp;are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Steatornys</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lophuromys,</span><span class="font0"> which include several species of&nbsp;small mouse-like rodents, with the habits of dormice generally,&nbsp;though some burrow in cornfields. Here also may be noticed&nbsp;the huge Philippine long-haired rats of the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phlaeomys,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">characterized by their broad incisors, transversely laminated&nbsp;molars and large claws. They are often regarded as forming a&nbsp;sub-family by themselves. The gerbils, which arc widely distri-buted over the more or less desert-like regions of the Old World&nbsp;exclusive of the Malay countries and Australia, form the sub-family&nbsp;GcrbilIinae. They have long hind limbs, large eyes and ears; and&nbsp;in correlation with the latter an enlarged auditory bulla to the&nbsp;skull, which is hollow and divided into a tympanic and a mastoid&nbsp;portion. The tail is generally long and hairy. There are three&nbsp;pairs of rooted molars, whose crowns carry transverse plates, decreasing in number from three in the first to one in the last tooth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gerbillus</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tatera),</span><span class="font0"> with a large number of species, has a range coextensive with that of the sub-family; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pachyuromys,</span><span class="font0"> with two&nbsp;African species, has a short club-shaped tail and enormous auditory bullae; while the remaining members of the group, which&nbsp;arc confined to North Africa, Eastern Europe and Asia, are arranged&nbsp;in the genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Meriones, Psammomys</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhombomys,</span><span class="font0"> the latter&nbsp;represented only by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">R. opimus</span><span class="font0"> from Russia and Central Asia (see&nbsp;GerbilJ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The last representatives of the Muridae are confined to Australasia and the Philippines, and constitute the sub-family&nbsp;Hydromyinae, characterized by the very general presence of only&nbsp;two pairs of molars in each jaw. In the typical Australian and&nbsp;Papuan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hydromys,</span><span class="font0"> locally known as water-rats, the molars originally have transverse ridges, the enamel folds between which form&nbsp;cutting edges whose sharpness depends upon the degree to which&nbsp;the teeth have been worn, while the large hind feet are webbed. The&nbsp;typical </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">H. Chrysogaster</span><span class="font0"> is a large brown rat with an orange belly,&nbsp;which feeds on small fishes and insects. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Limnomys,</span><span class="font0"> from New&nbsp;Guinea, is a type less specialized for swimming, the hind-feet being&nbsp;much less twisted than in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hydromys,</span><span class="font0"> and not so fully webbed. Still&nbsp;less specialized are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chrotomys</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Xerornys,</span><span class="font0"> which include Philippine land-rats, while </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crunomys,</span><span class="font0"> from the same area, retains the&nbsp;third molars, and thus connects the group with the Murinac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Finally, the Philippine </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhynchomys</span><span class="font0"> is represented by a rat with two pairs of molars and a long shrew-like nose, the zygomatic arch&nbsp;of the skull being also placed unusually far backward.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Strand-Moles.-yWith</span><span class="font0"> the so-called strand-moles of South Africa, forming the section Bathycrgoidea, and the family Bathyergidac,&nbsp;which were formerly placed with the Spalacidac, we come to the first&nbsp;of two sections in which the lower jaw has a totally different form to&nbsp;that obtaining in all the preceding groups. In the rodents now&nbsp;to be considered, the angular process of the lower jaw arises from the&nbsp;outer side of the sheath of the incisor. The malleus and incus cf&nbsp;the internal ear are united, and there is no transverse canal in the&nbsp;skull. At least one pair of premolars is present in each jaw; and&nbsp;these teeth and the molars typically have one outer and one inner&nbsp;enamel fold. There is no foramen at the lower end of the humerus,&nbsp;and no horny layer in the stomach.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Bathyergoidea the scaphoid and lunar of the carpus ate separate, the tibia and fibula united and the clavicles normal. The&nbsp;masseter muscle does not pass through the narrow infra-orbital&nbsp;canal, and the temporal muscle is large. All the Bathycrgidae arc&nbsp;African, and adapted to a burrowing life, having minute ears and&nbsp;eyes, a short tail and the thumb armed with a large claw. The&nbsp;largest species represents the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bathyergus,</span><span class="font0"> while several&nbsp;smaller kinds are included in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Georychus,</span><span class="font0"> The former constructs&nbsp;its tunnels in the sandy flats near the shore at the Cape, but the&nbsp;latter generally frequent higher ground, in both genera there is&nbsp;only a single pair of premolars in each iaw, but in the smaller&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Myoscalops</span><span class="font0"> there are usually three pairs of these teeth. The most&nbsp;remarkable members of the family arc the sand-rats of Somaliland&nbsp;and Shoa, forming the genera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heterocephalus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fornarina,</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;which the premolars may be reduced to two pairs. They ha\c&nbsp;large heads,projecting incisors, no cars, almost fUnctionlcss eyes and&nbsp;moderately long tails; the skin, with the exception of a few hairs&nbsp;on the body and fringes on the feet, being naked. They spend&nbsp;their whole time buried in the hot desert sand, in which they&nbsp;construct burrows, throwing up at intervals small hillocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Porcupines.—</span><span class="font0">In the second section, or Hystricoidea, including several families, the skull (fig. 14) is characterized by the heavy</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">zygomatic arch, the middle portion of which is formed by the more or less straight and horizontal jugal, and the large infra-orbital&nbsp;canal, traversed by a portion of the masseter muscle. The tibia&nbsp;and fibula are separate, but the scaphoid and lunar are united,&nbsp;and the clavicles arc generally incomplete. There is never more</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
