<p><span class="font1">by alluvion is occasionally of considerable practical importance. In the reign of Charles I. the estate of Lord Berkeley was increased&nbsp;by 300 acres left dry by the Severn. The land was claimed for Vie&nbsp;crown, but judgment was given in favour of Lord Berkeley. If an&nbsp;island be formed in the stream, it belongs to the proprietor to&nbsp;whose land it is nearest; if it be exactly in mid-stream, it belongs&nbsp;to the riparian proprietors equally. The r⅛ht of use of the water&nbsp;of a natural stream cannot be better described than in the words&nbsp;of Lord Kingsdown :—“ By the general law applicable to running&nbsp;streams, every riparian proprietor has a right to what may be called&nbsp;the ordinary use of water flowing past his land,—for instance, to&nbsp;the reasonable use of the water for domestic purposes and for his&nbsp;cattle, and this without regard to the effect which such use may&nbsp;have in case of a deficiency upon proprietors lower down the&nbsp;st ream. But, further, he has a right to the use of it for auy purpose,&nbsp;or what may be deemed the extraordinary use of it, provided he&nbsp;does not thereby interfere with the rights of other proprietors,&nbsp;either above or below him. Subject to this condition, he may&nbsp;dam up a stream for the purposes of a mill, or divert the water for&nbsp;the purpose of irrigation. But he has no right to intercept tho&nbsp;regular flow of the stream, if he thereby interferes with the lawful&nbsp;use of the water by other proprietors, and inflicts upon them a&nbsp;sensible injury,” (Miner®. Gilmour, 12 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Moore's Privy Council Cases,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">156). The rights of riparian proprietors where the flow of water&nbsp;is artificial rest on a different principle. As the artificial stream&nbsp;is made by a person for his own benefit, any right of another&nbsp;person as a riparian proprietor does not arise at common law, as&nbsp;in the case of a natural stream, but must be established by grant&nbsp;or prescription. The rights of a person nota riparian proprietor&nbsp;who uses land abutting on a river by the licence or grant of the&nbsp;riparian proprietor are not as full as though he were a riparian&nbsp;proprietor, for he cannot be imposed as a riparian proprietor upon&nbsp;the other proprietors without their consent. The effect of this&nbsp;appears to be that he is not entitled to sensibly affect their rights,&nbsp;even by the ordinary as distinguished from the extraordinary use&nbsp;of the water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The limitations to which the right of the riparian proprietor is subject may be divided into those existing by common right, those&nbsp;imposed for public purposes, and those established against him by&nbsp;crown grant or by custom or prescription. Under the first head&nbsp;comes the public right of navigation, of anchorage and fishery from&nbsp;boats (in tidal waters), and of taking shell-fish (and probably other&nbsp;fish except royal fish) on the shore of tidal λvaters as far as any&nbsp;right of several fishery does not intervene. Under the second head&nbsp;would fall the right of eminent domain by which the state takes&nbsp;riparian rights for public purposes, compensating the proprietor,&nbsp;the restrictions upon the fishery rights of the proprietor, as by Acts&nbsp;forbidding the taking of fish in close time, and the restrictions on&nbsp;the ground of public health, as by the Rivers Pollution Act, 1876.&nbsp;The jurisdiction of the state over rivers in England may be exercised by officers of the crown, as by commissioners of sewers or&nbsp;by the Board of Trade under the Crown Lands Act, 1866. A bridge&nbsp;is erected and supported by the county authorities, and the riparian&nbsp;proprietor must bear any inconvenience resulting from it. An&nbsp;example of an adverse right by crown grant is a Ferry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;a port. The crown, moreover, as the guardian of the realm, has&nbsp;jurisdiction to restrain the removal of the foreshore, the natural&nbsp;barrier of the sea, by its owner in case of apprehended danger to the&nbsp;coast. The rights established against a riparian proprietor by&nbsp;private persons must as a rule be based on prescription or custom,&nbsp;only on prescription where they are in the nature of profits </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a&nbsp;prendre</span><span class="font1"> (see Prescription). Among such rights are the right to&nbsp;bathe, to land, to discharge cargo, to tow, to dry nets, to beach&nbsp;boats, to take sand, shingle, or water, to have a sea-wall maintained, to pollute the water (subject to the Rivers Pollution Act).&nbsp;In some cases the validity of local riparian customs has been recognized by the legislature. The right to enter on lands adjoining&nbsp;tidal waters for the purpose of watching for and landing herrings,&nbsp;pilchards, and other sea-fish was confirmed to the fishermen of&nbsp;Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall by 1 Jac. I. c. 23. The digging&nbsp;of sand on the shore of tidal waters for use as manure on the land&nbsp;was granted to the inhabitants of Devon and Cornwall by 7 Jac. I.&nbsp;c. 18. The public right of taking or killing rabbits in the daytime on any sea bank or river bank in the county of Lincoln, so far&nbsp;as the tide extends, or within one furlong of such bank, was preserved by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">24 &amp;</span><span class="font1"> 25 Viet. c. 96, § 17. It should be noticed that&nbsp;rights of the public may be subject to private rights. Where the&nbsp;river is navigable, although the right of navigation is common to&nbsp;the subjects of the realm, it may be connected with a right to&nbsp;exclusive access to riparian land, the invasion of which may form&nbsp;the ground for legal proceedings by the riparian proprietor (see&nbsp;Lyon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">v.</span><span class="font1"> The Fishmongers’ Company, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Law Reports—Appeal Cases,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">vol. i., 662).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A freshwater lake appears to be governed by the same law as a non-tidal river. The preponderance of authority is in favour of the&nbsp;right of the riparian proprietors as against the crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Unlawful and malicious injury to sea and river banks, towing paths, sluices, floodgates, milldams, &amp;c., or poisoning fish is a crime&nbsp;under 24 &amp; 25 Viet. c. 97.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland.—</span><span class="font1">The law of Scotland is in general accordance with that of England. One of the principal differences is that in Scotland,&nbsp;if a charter state that the sea is the boundary of a grant, the foreshore is included in the grant, subject to the burden of crown&nbsp;rights for public purposes. Persons engaged in the herring fishery&nbsp;off the coast of Scotland have, by 11 Geo. III. c. 31, the right to&nbsp;use the shore for 100 yards from high-water mark for landing&nbsp;and drying nets, erecting huts, and curing fish. Similar powers&nbsp;were given to those engaged in any white fish fishery by 29 Geo. II.&nbsp;c. 23 ; but the section of the Act giving these powers was repealed&nbsp;by the Sea Fisheries Act, 1868.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">United States.—</span><span class="font1">In the United States the common law’ of England was originally adopted, the State succeeding to the right of the&nbsp;crown. This was no doubt sufficient in the thirteen original&nbsp;States, where rivers of the largest size do not occur, but was not&nbsp;generally followed in later times when it had become obvious that&nbsp;English law was insufficient to meet the case of the vast rivers and&nbsp;lakes of North America. “ In Pennsylvania, North Carolina, South&nbsp;Carolina, Iow<sup>,</sup>a, Mississippi, and Alabama, it has been determined&nbsp;that the common law<sup>,</sup> does not prevail, and that the ownership of&nbsp;the bed or soil of all rivers navigable for any useful purpose of trade&nbsp;or agriculture, whether tidal or fresh u<sup>r</sup>ater, is in the State”&nbsp;(Bouvier, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Law Diet., s.υ.</span><span class="font1"> “River”). The supreme court of the&nbsp;United States in 1857 declared constitutional an Act of Congress of&nbsp;1845, extending the admiralty jurisdiction of the United States to&nbsp;all public navigable rivers and lakes where commerce is earned on&nbsp;between different States or with foreign nations (The Propeller&nbsp;Genesee Chief </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">v.</span><span class="font1"> Fitzhugh, 12 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Howard's Reports,</span><span class="font1"> 443). The right&nbsp;of eminent domain has been exercised to a much greater extent than&nbsp;in England in the acquisition of sites for mills under the powers of&nbsp;State legislation in encouragement of trade. Such a course has&nbsp;never been necessary in England (see Angell, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Law of Watercourses,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">§ 478). The law as to subterranean water seems to be still&nbsp;unsettled. Some State decisions have recognized a public right to&nbsp;moor vessels and place cargo on the shore.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(J. W+.)</span></p>

This commentary, however, which is now an&nbsp;integral part of the book, was not written for it by Rashi&nbsp;himself, who could scarcely have known of Riph’s existence, and much less of his work.
