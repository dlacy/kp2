<p><span class="font2">his bearing towards other scholars Ruhnken was generous and dignified, distributing literary aid with a free hand,&nbsp;and meeting onslaughts for the most part with a smile. It&nbsp;would be difficult to point out in the history of scholarship&nbsp;the name of another man who so thoroughly possessed the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">savoir vivre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the records of learning Ruhnken occupies an important position. He forms a principal link in the chain which connects Bentley with the modern scholarship of&nbsp;the Continent. The spirit and the aims of Hemsterhuis,&nbsp;the great reviver of Continental learning, were committed&nbsp;to his trust, and were faithfully maintained. He greatly&nbsp;widened the circle of those who valued taste and precision&nbsp;in classical scholarship. He powerfully aided the emancipation of Greek studies from theology ; nor must it be&nbsp;forgotten that he first in modern times dared to think of&nbsp;rescuing Plato from the hands of the professed philosophers—men presumptuous enough to interpret the&nbsp;ancient sage with little or no knowledge of the language&nbsp;in which he wrote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rnhnken’s principal works are editions of (1) Timæus’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lexicon of Platonic Words,</span><span class="font1"> (2) Thalelæus nnd other Greek commentators&nbsp;on Roman law, (3) Rutilius Lupus and other grammarians, (4)&nbsp;Velleius Paterculus, (5) the works of Muretus. He also occupied&nbsp;himself much with the history of Greek literature, particularly the&nbsp;oratorical literature, with the Homeric hymns, the scholia on Plato,&nbsp;and the Greek and Roman grammarians and rhetoricians. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span class="font1"> discovery famous in its time was that in the text of the work of&nbsp;Apsines on rhetoric a large piece of a work by Longinus was&nbsp;embedded. Recent views of the writings attributed to Longinus&nbsp;have lessened the interest of this discovery without lessening its&nbsp;merit. The biography of Ruhnken was written by his great pupil&nbsp;Wyttenbach, soon after his death.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. S. R. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RUHRORT, a busy trading town in Prussia, is situated at the junction of the Ruhr and Rhine, in the midst of a&nbsp;productive coal district, 15 miles north of Düsseldorf.&nbsp;Ruhrort has the largest river harbour in Germany, with&nbsp;very extensive quays; and most of the IJ million tons of&nbsp;coal which are annually exported from the neighbourhood&nbsp;are despatched in the fleet of steam-tugs and barges which&nbsp;belong to the port. About one half of the coal goes to&nbsp;Holland, and the rest to towns on the upper Rhine.&nbsp;Grain and timber are also exported. In 1881 11,282&nbsp;craft, carrying 1,791,213 tons, left the harbour. The&nbsp;goods traffic between Ruhrort and Homberg on the&nbsp;opposite bank of the Rhine is carried on by large steam&nbsp;ferry boats, in which the railway waggons are placed with&nbsp;the help of towers, 128 feet high, on each side of the river.&nbsp;The industries of the town include active shipbuilding,&nbsp;iron and tin working, and the making of cordage and&nbsp;machinery. The inhabitants numbered 1443 in 1816, and&nbsp;9130 in 1880. Ruhrort formerly belonged to Cleves:&nbsp;it received town rights in 1587.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RULHIERE, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">RulhiLres, Claude Carloman de </span><span class="font2">(1735-1791), poet and historian, was born at Bondy in&nbsp;1735, and died at Paris in 1791. He was for a time&nbsp;a soldier, and served under Richelieu in Germany. But at&nbsp;twenty-five he accompanied Breteuil to St Petersburg as&nbsp;secretary of legation. Here he actually saw the revolution which seated Catherine IL on the throne, and thus&nbsp;obtained the facts of his best-known and best work, the&nbsp;short sketch called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anecdotes sur la Revolution de Russie&nbsp;en 1762.</span><span class="font2"> It was not published till after the empress’s&nbsp;death. The later years of Rulhière’s life were spent either&nbsp;in Paris, where he held an appointment in the foreign&nbsp;office and went much into society, or else in travelling&nbsp;over Germany and Poland. The distracted affairs of this&nbsp;latter country gave him the subject of his longest work,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de FAnarchix de Pologne</span><span class="font2"> (1807), which was never&nbsp;finished, and which the patriotism of its latest editor, M.&nbsp;Ostrowski, has rather unjustifiably rebaptized </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Revolutions&nbsp;de Pologne.</span><span class="font2"> Rulhière was made an Academician in 1787.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Besides the historical works mentioned, he wrote one on the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1788).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rulbiere as an historian has much merit of style and arrangement, and the short sketch of the Russian revolution is justly ranked&nbsp;among the masterpieces of the kind in French. Of the larger&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polaiui</span><span class="font1"> Carlyle, as justly, complains that its allowance of fact is&nbsp;too small in proportion to its bulk. The author was also a fertile&nbsp;writer of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vers de société,</span><span class="font1"> short satires, epigrams, Ac., which show&nbsp;much point and polish, and he had a considerable reputation among&nbsp;the witty and ill-natured group also containing Chamfort, Rivarol,&nbsp;Champcenetz, Ac. On the other hand he has the credit of being&nbsp;long and disinterestedly assiduous in caring for J. J. Rousseau in&nbsp;his morose old age, until Rousseau as usual quarrelled with him.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RUM is a spirituous liquor, prepared from molasses, skimmings of the boiling house, and other saccharine byeproducts, and the refuse juice of the cane-sugar manufacture. Its distillation, which is a simple process, may be&nbsp;conducted in connexion with any cane-sugar establishment, but the rum which comes to the American and&nbsp;European markets is chiefly the produce of the West&nbsp;India Islands and Guiana. The ordinary method of&nbsp;working in the West Indies is the following. A wash is&nbsp;prepared consisting of sugar skimmings 4 parts, lees of&nbsp;still or d under 5 parts, and molasses 1 part, the quantity&nbsp;prepared being equal to the capacity of the still in use.&nbsp;Dunder consists of the residue of the still from previous&nbsp;distillations, and it takes the place of a ferment, besides&nbsp;which the acetic acid it contains, derived from the fermenting wash of previous operations, has a favourable&nbsp;influence on the progress of attenuation. The wash prepared as above is placed in the fermenting vat, where,&nbsp;according to weather and other conditions, the fermentation proceeds more or less briskly ; but usually a week or&nbsp;ten days is the period required for attenuation, during&nbsp;which time the scum formed is removed from the surface&nbsp;of the vat twice daily. λVhen sufficiently attenuated, the&nbsp;wash is run into the still, which is generally of a simple&nbsp;construction, and distilled off, the first product being&nbsp;“ low wines,” which on redistillation come over as “ high&nbsp;wines” or strong rum. When a Pontefex still is used,&nbsp;which contains two intermediate “ retorts” between the&nbsp;still and the worm, a strong spirit is obtained at the first&nbsp;distillation. The charge of wash yields from 10 to 12&nbsp;per cent, of rum, of an average strength of 25’ over&nbsp;proof. Pure distilled rum is an entirely colourless liquid,&nbsp;but as imported and sold it generally has a deep brown&nbsp;colour imparted by caramel or by storage in sherry casks.&nbsp;It has a peculiar aroma, derived principally from the presence of a minute proportion of butyric ether. Rum varies&nbsp;very considerably in quality, the finest being known as&nbsp;Jamaica rum, whether it is the product of that island or&nbsp;not. An inferior quality of rum is known among the&nbsp;French as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tafia</span><span class="font2"> ; and the lowest quality, into the wash for&nbsp;which debris of sugar cane enters, is called negro rum, and&nbsp;is mostly consumed by the coloured workers in the sugar&nbsp;houses and distilleries. The planters sometimes put rinds&nbsp;and slices of pine-apple into the barrels in which rum is&nbsp;matured, to improve and add to its flavour, and occasionally anise and other flavouring ingredients are also used.&nbsp;The spirit prepared from molasses of beet-sugar factories&nbsp;cannot be classed with rum. The product has a highly&nbsp;disagreeable odour and taste, and it can only be rendered&nbsp;fit for consumption by repeated distillation and concentration to a high degree of strength, whereby the spirit is&nbsp;rendered “silent,” or has only a faint rum flavour. In&nbsp;this condition it is used for mixing with strongly flavoured&nbsp;rum, and for the Jireparation of a fictitious rum, the&nbsp;flavour of which is due to “ rum essence,”—a mixture of&nbsp;artificial ether, birch bark oil, and other substances. Cane-sugar molasses enters largely into the materials from which</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
