It is primarily a residential district. Among its institutions are the Roxbury Latin School, established in 1645,@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> the Fellowes Athenaeum (a part of the Roxbury branch of the Boston Public Library), -with about 26,000 volumes in 1909, and the New England Hospital for Women and Children (1863), the New England Baptist Hospital (1893), the Woman’s Charity Club Hospital (1890), the Roxbury Homoeopathic Dispensary (1886), the Roxbury Home for Children and Aged Women (1856), a Home for Aged Couples (1884) and the Massachusetts Home,for Intemperate Women (1879). On Mount Bellevue, in West Roxbury (set apart from Roxbury in 1851 and annexed to Boston in 1873), there is an observatory (erected in 1869 by the city of Boston as a standpipe for the high service water supply). Among the manufactures of the district are cotton and woollen goods, cordage, carpets, shoes and foundry products. The town of Roxbury (at first usually spelled Rocksbury) was founded in 1630 by some of the Puritan immigrants who came with Governor John Winthrop; the settlers were led by William Pynchon, who in 1636 led a party from here and founded Springfield, Mass. At the home of Rev Thomas Welde (d. 1662), the first minister, Anne Hutchinson<hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>  was held in custody during the winter of 1637-38. Associated as teacher with Welde and his successors, Samuel Danforth and Nehemiah Walter, was John Eliot, the apostle to the Indians, who removed to Roxbury in 1632 and died here in 1690. Roxbury was the home also of Thomas Dudley, of his son Joseph and of his grandson Paul; of Robert Calef (d. 1719), the leader of the opposition to the witchcraft craze; of General Joseph Warren, and of William Eustis (1753-1825), who was U.S. secretary of war (1809-12), minister to the Netherlands (1814-18), and governor of Massachusetts (1823-25); and from 1837 to 1845 Theodore Parker was the pastor of the Unitarian Church of West Roxbury. Of special interest in the old Roxbury burial-ground is the “ Ministers’ Tomb,” containing the remains of John Eliot, and the tomb of the Dudleys. West Roxbury was the scene of the Brook Farm experiment (see Brook Farm). Roxbury was</p><p>. chartered as a city in 1846.</p><p>See F. S.

In 1746, when an assistant in the office of Colonel Watson, deputy quartermaster-general in North Britain, he began the survey of the mainland of Scotland, the results of which were embodied in what is known as the “duke of Cumberland’s map.” In 1755 he obtained his commission in the 4th King’s Own Foot, and in 1759 gained his lieutenancy and went to serve in Germany in the Seven Years’ War. In 1765 he appears as deputy quartermaster-general to the forces, surveyor-general of coasts and engineer-director of military surveys in Great Britain; in 1767 he became F.R.S., in 1781 major-general, in 1783 director of Royal Engineers. Besides his Campaigns and observations in Germany, his visits to Ireland (1766) and to Gibraltar (1768) were important. In 1783-84 he conducted observations for determining the relative positions of the French and English royal observatories. His measurement of a base-line for that purpose on Hounslow Heath in 1784, the germ of all subsequent surveys of the United Kingdom, gained him in 1785 the</p><p>@@@ This school was founded, primarily through the influence of the Rev. John Eliot, by inhabitants of Roxbury. In 1672 Thomas Bell, one of the original founders, bequeathed to the school all his Roxbury lands. In 1789 the school was incorporated.</p><p>Copley medal of the Royal Society. Roy’s measurements (not fully utilized till 1787, when the Paris and Greenwich observatories were properly connected) form the basis of the topographical survey of Middlesex, Surrey, Kent and Sussex. He was finishing an account of this work for the <hi rend="italic">Phil. Trans. </hi>when he died on the 1st of July 1790.</p><p>Roy’s principal book-publication is the <hi rend="italic">Military Antiquities of the Romans in Britain</hi>  (1793).

It is a handsome plant with bi-pinnate fronds 2 to 6 ft. long and 1 ft. or more broad; the tops of the fronds are fertile, the fertile pinnae being cylindrical and densely covered with the spore-cases, giving the appearance of a dense panicle of flowers, whence the plant is known as the flowering fern. There are various cultivated forms—<hi rend="italic">cristata </hi>has the ends of the fronds and the pinnae finely crested, and <hi rend="italic">corymbifera</hi>  has curiously forked and crested fronds. Several other species, such as <hi rend="italic">0. cinnamomea, O. Claytoniana,</hi>  are known as handsome greenhouse ferns (see also Ferns).</p><p>ROYAL SOCIETY, THE, thé oldest scientific society in Great Britain, and one of the oldest in Europe. The Royal Society (more fully, The Royal Society of London for Improving Natural Knowledge) is usually considered to have been founded in the year 1660, but a nucleus had in fact been in existence for some years before that date. As early as the year 1645 weekly meetings were held in London of “ divers worthy persons, inquisitive into natural philosophy and other parts of human learning, and particularly of what hath been called the <hi rend="italic">New Philosophy</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Experimental Philosophy/’</hi>  and there can be little doubt that this gathering of philosophers is identical with the “ Invisible College ” of which Boyle speaks in sundry letters written in 1646 and 1647. These weekly meetings, according to Wallis, were first suggested by Theodore Haak, “ a German of the Palatinate then resident in London,” and they were held sometimes in Dr Goddard’s lodgings in Wood Street, sometimes at the Bull-Head Tavern in Cheapside.</p><p>Some of these “ Philosophers,” resident in Oxford about 1648, formed an association there under the title of the Philosophical Society of Oxford, and used to meet, most usually in the roonis of Dr Wilkins, warden of Wadham College. A close intercommunication was maintained between the Oxford and London Philosophers; but ultimately the activity of the society was concentrated in the London meetings, which were held principally at Gresham College.</p><p>On November 28, 1660, the first journal book of the society was opened with a “ memorandum,” from which the following is an extract: “ Memorandum that Novemb. 28.1660, These persons following, according to the usuall custom of most of them, mett together at Gresham Colledge to heare Mr Wren’s lecture, viz. The Lord Brouncker, Mr Boyle, Mr Bruce, Sir Robert Moray, Sir Paul Neile, Dr Wilkins, Dr Goddard, Dr Petty, Mr Ball, Mr Rooke, Mr Wren, Mr Hill. And after the lecture was ended, they did, according to the usuall manner, withdrawe for mutuall converse. Where amongst other matters that were discoursed of, something was offered about a désigné of founding a Colledge for the promoting of Physico-Mathematicall Experimental! Learning.” It was agreed at this meeting that the company should continue to assemble on Wednesdays at three o’clock; an admission fee of ten shillings with a subscription of one shilling a week was instituted; Dr Wilkins was appointed chairman; and a list of forty-one persons judged likely and fit to join the design was drawn up. On the following Wednesday Sir Robert Moray brought word that the king (Charles II.) approved the design of the meetings; a form of obligation was framed, and was signed by all the persons enumerated in the memorandum of the 28th of November and by seventy-three others. On the 12th of December another meeting was held at</p></body></text></TEI>
