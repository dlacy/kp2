<p><label>RADNOR, NEW</label>
a market and borough town in the county of Radnor, in South Wales, 159 miles from London. It was formerly defended by a strong castle at the entrance of the pass between the two hills in which it is built, but that was destroyed by Owen Glendower in the reign of Henry IV. It is still a borough, and has a market which is held on Saturday. The population was in 1801, 329 ; in 1811, 380 ; in 1821, 426 ; and in 1831, 472. It now returns one member conjointly with the boroughs of Knighton, Rhayadyr, Cefn-llys, and Crwclas.</p>
