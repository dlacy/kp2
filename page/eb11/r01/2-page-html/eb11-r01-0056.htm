<p><span class="font0">in turn fixed to the sleepers by two iron spikes, half-round wooden cross sleepers being employed on embankments and&nbsp;stone blocks 20 in. square by 10 in. deep in cuttings. The fish-bellied rails, however, were found to break near the chairs,&nbsp;and from 1834 they began to be replaced with parallel rails&nbsp;weighing 50 lb to the yard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next important development in rail design originated in America, which, for the few lines that had been laid up to 1830,&nbsp;remained content with wooden bars faced with iron. In that&nbsp;year Robert Livingston Stevens (1787-1856), devised for the&nbsp;Camden &amp; Amboy railway a rail similar as to its top to those&nbsp;in use in England, but having a flat base or foot by which it was&nbsp;secured to the sleepers by hook-headed spikes, without chairs&nbsp;(fig. 3); he had to get the first lot of these rails, which were&nbsp;15 ft. long and weighed 36 ℔ to the yard, manufactured in&nbsp;England, since there were then no mills in America able to roll&nbsp;them. This type, which is often known as the Vignoles rail, after&nbsp;Charles Blacker Vignoles (1793-1875), who re-invented it in&nbsp;England in 1836, is in general use in America and on the continent&nbsp;of Europe. The bridge-rail (fig. 4)—so called because it was</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">first laid on bridges—was supported on continuous longitudinal sleepers and held down by bolts passing through the flanges,&nbsp;and was employed by I. K. Brunel on the Great Western railway,&nbsp;where, however, it was abandoned after the line was converted&nbsp;from broad to standard gauge in 1892. In the double-headed&nbsp;rail (fig. 5), originated by Joseph Locke in 1837, and first laid&nbsp;on the Grand Junction railway, the two tables were equal.&nbsp;This rail was more easily rolled than others, and, being reversible,&nbsp;was in fact two rails in one. But as it was laid in cast-iron chairs&nbsp;the lower table was exposed to damage under the hammering&nbsp;of the traffic, and thus was liable to be rendered useless as a&nbsp;running surface. In consequence the bull-headed rail (fig. 6)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">was evolved, in which the lower table was made of smaller size and was intended merely as a support, not as a surface to be&nbsp;used by the wheels. There was a waste of metal in these early&nbsp;rails owing to the excessive thickness of the vertical web, and&nbsp;subsequent improvements have consisted in adjusting the&nbsp;dimensions so as to combine strength with economy of metal,&nbsp;as well as in the substitution of steel for wrought iron (after&nbsp;the introduction of the Bessemer process) and in minute attention&nbsp;to the composition of the steel employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was found, naturally, that the rails would not rest in their chairs at the joints, but were loosened and bruised at the ends&nbsp;by the blows of the traffic. The fish-joint was therefore devised&nbsp;in 1847 by W. Bridges Adams, the intention being by “ fishing ”&nbsp;the joints to convert the rails into continuous beams. In the&nbsp;original design two chairs were placed, one under each rail, a&nbsp;few inches apart, as in fig. 7. The joint was thus suspended&nbsp;between the two chairs, and two keys of iron, called&nbsp;“ fishes, ” fitting the side channels of the rails, were driven&nbsp;in on each side between the chairs and the rails. In subse-quent modifications the fishes were, as they continue to be,&nbsp;bolted to and through the rails, the sleepers being placed&nbsp;rather further apart and the joint being generally suspended&nbsp;between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The iron tramway or railway had been known for half a century and had come into considerable use in connexion with&nbsp;collieries and quarries before it was realized that for the carriage</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of general merchandise it might prove a serious competitor to the canals, of which a large mileage had been constructed in&nbsp;Great Britain during that period. In the article on “Railways”&nbsp;in the Supplement to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</span><span class="font0"> published in&nbsp;1824, it is said: “It will appear that this species of inland&nbsp;carriage [railways] is principally applicable where trade is&nbsp;considerable and the length of conveyance short; and is chiefly&nbsp;useful, therefore, in transporting the mineral produce of the&nbsp;kingdom from the mines to the nearest land or water communication, whether sea, river or canal. Attempts have been made&nbsp;to bring it into more general use, but without success; and it is&nbsp;only in particular circumstances that navigation, with the aid&nbsp;either of locks or inclined planes to surmount the elevations,&nbsp;will not present a more convenient medium for an extended&nbsp;trade. ” It must be remembered, however, that at this time the&nbsp;railways were nearly all worked by horse-traction, and that the&nbsp;use of steam had made but little progress. Richard Trevithick,&nbsp;indeed, had in 1804 tried a high-pressure steam Iocomotive, with&nbsp;smooth wheels, on a plate-way near Merthyr Tydvil, but it&nbsp;was found more expensive than horses; John Blenkinsop in&nbsp;1811 patented an engine with cogged wheel and rack-rail which&nbsp;was used, with commercial success, to convey coal from his&nbsp;Middleton colliery to Leeds; William Hedley in 1813 built two&nbsp;locomotives—Puffing Billy and Wylam Dilly—for hauling coal&nbsp;from Wylam Colliery, near Newcastle; and in the following&nbsp;year George Stephenson’s first engine, the Blucher, drew a train&nbsp;of eight loaded wagons, weighing 30 tons, at a speed of 4 m. an&nbsp;hour up a gradient of 1 in 450. But, in the words of the same&nbsp;article, “ This application of steam has not yet arrived at such&nbsp;perfection as to have brought it into general use. ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The steam locomotive, however, and with it the railways, soon began to make rapid progress. On the Stockton &amp;&nbsp;Darlington railway, which was authorized by parliament in&nbsp;1821, animal power was at first proposed, but on the advice&nbsp;of Stephenson, its engineer, steam-engines were adopted.&nbsp;This line, with three branches, was over 38 m. in length, and&nbsp;was in the first instance laid with a single track, passing-places&nbsp;being provided at intervals of a quarter of a mile. At its&nbsp;opening, on the 27th of September 1825, a train of thirty-four vehicles, making a gross load of about 90 tons, was drawn&nbsp;by one engine driven by Stephenson, with a signalman on horse-back in advance. The train moved off at the rate of from 10&nbsp;to 12 m. an hour, and attained a speed of 15 m. an hour on&nbsp;favourable parts of the line. A train weighing 92 tons could be&nbsp;drawn by one engine at the rate of 5 m. an hour. The principal&nbsp;business of the new railway was the conveyance of minerals&nbsp;and goods, but from the first passengers insisted upon being&nbsp;carried, and on the 10th of October 1825 the company began&nbsp;to run a daily coach, called the “ Experiment, ’’ to carry six&nbsp;inside, and from fifteen to twenty outside, making the journey&nbsp;from Darlington to Stockton and back in two hours. The&nbsp;fare was 1s., and each passenger was allowed to take baggage&nbsp;not exceeding 14 ℔ weight. The rate for carriage of merchandise was reduced from 5d. to one-fifth of a penny per ton&nbsp;per mile, and that of minerals from 7d. to 1½d. per ton per mile.&nbsp;The price of coals at Darlington fell from 18s. to 8s. 6d. a ton.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The example of the Stockton &amp; Darlington line was followed by the Monklands railway in Scotland, opened in 1826, and several other small lines—including the Canterbury &amp;</span></p>
