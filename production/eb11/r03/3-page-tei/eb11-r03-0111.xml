In 1368 he was created earl of Carrick, and he took somepart in the government of the kingdom until about 1387, when he was disabled by the kick of a horse. It was probably in consequence of this accident that his brother Robert, earl of Fife, and not the crown prince himself, was made guardian of the kingdom in 1389; but the latter succeeded to the throne on his father’s death in May 1390. At this time he changed his baptismal name of John, which was unpopular owing to its connexion with John de Bahol, for that of Robert, being crowned at Scone in August 1390 as King Robert III. Although he probably attended several parliaments the new king was only the nominal ruler of Scotland, the real power being in the hands of his brother, the earl of Fife. In 1399, however, owing to the king’s “ sickness of the body,” his elder son, David, duke of Rothesay, was appointed Ueutenant of the kingdom; but this event was followed by an EngUsh invasion of Scotland, by serious differences between Rothesay and his uncle, Robert, now duke of Albany, and finally in March 1402 by Rothesay’s. mysterious death at Falkland. Early in 1406 the king’s only surviving son, afterwards King James I., was captured by the EngUsh; and on the 4th of April 1406 Robert died, probably at Rothesay, and was buried at Paisley. He married AnnabeUa Drummond (c. 1350-1402), daughter of Sir John Drummond of StobhaU, and, in addition to the two sons already mentioned, had four daughters.</p><p><hi rend="bold">ROBERT I. </hi><hi rend="italic">(o'</hi>  865-923), king of France, or king of the Franks, was the younger son of Robert the Strong, count of Anjou, and the brother of Odo, or Eudes, who became king of the western Franks in 888. Appointed by Odo ruler of several .counties, including the county of Paris, and abbot <hi rend="italic">in Commendam</hi>  of many abbeys, Robert also secured the office of duke of the Franks, a miUtary dignity of high importance. He did not claim the crown of France when his brother died in 898; but recognizing the supremacy of the Carolingian king, Charles III., the Simple, he was confirmed in his offices and possessions, after which he continued to defend northern France from the attacks of the Normans. The peace between the king and his powerful vassal was not seriously disturbed until about 921. The rule of Charles, and especiaUy his partiality for a certain IIagano, had aroused some irritation; and, supported by many of the clergy and by some of the most powerful of the Frankish nobles, Robert took up arms, drove Charles into Lorraine, and was himself crowned king of the Franks at Reims on the 29th of June 922. CoUectingan army, Charles marched against the usurper, and on the 15th of June 923, in a stubborn and sanguinary battle near Soissons, Robert was kiUed, according to one tradition in single combat with his rival. Robert left a son. Hugh the Great, duke of the Franks, and his grandson was Hugh Capet, king of France.</p><p>See F. Lot, <hi rend="italic">Les Derniers Carolingiens</hi>  (Paris, 1891); and E. Lavisse, <hi rend="italic">Histoire de France,</hi>  tome U. (Paris, 1903).</p><p><hi rend="bold">ROBERT H. </hi>(c. 970-ro3r), king of France, was a son of Hugh Capet, and was born at Orleans. Hewas educated at Reims under Gerbert, afterwards Pope SUvester II. As the ideal of medieval Christianity he won his surname of “ Pious ” by his humility and charity, but he also possessed some of the quaUtics of a soldier and a statesman. His father associated him with himself in the government of France, and he was crowned in December 987, becoming sole king on Hugh’s death in October 996. Robert’s reign is chiefly remembered for its dramatic side. In 988 he had married Rosala, or Susanna, widow of Arnold IL, count of Flanders. This lady, however, was much older than Robert, who repudiated her in 989, fixing his affections upon Bertha, daughter of Conrad the Peaceful, king of Burgundy, or Arles, and wife of Eudes L, count of Blois; and although the pair were related, and the king had been godfather to one of Bertha’s children, they were married in 996, a year after the death of Eudes. Pope Gregory V., whose favour Robert vainly sought to win by allowing Arnulf, the imprisoned archbishop, to return to his see of Reims and forcing Gcrbert to flee to the court of the emperor Otto III., excommunicated the king, and a council at Rome imposed a seven years’ penance upon him. For five years the king braved aU anathemas, but about 1002 he gave up Bertha and married Constance, daughter of a certain Count WiUiam, an intriguing and ambitious woman, who made life miserable for her husband, while the court was disturbed by quarrels between the partisans of the two queens. Still attached to Bertha, Robert took this lady with him to Rome in roro, but the pope refused to recognize their marriage, and the king was forced to return to Constance. By this wife Robert had four sons, and in 1017, the eldest of these, Hugh, (roo7~ro25), was crowned as his father’s coUeaguc and successor. After Hugh’s death the king procured the coronation of his second son, Henry, duke of Burgundy, afterwards king of France, a proceeding which displeased Constance, who wished her third son, Robert (d. 1075), afterwards duke of Burgundy, to receive the crown. Robert’s concluding days were troubled by a rising on the part of these two sons, and after a short war, in which he was worsted, the king died at Melun on the 20th of July i03r. The notable gain to France during this reign was the duchy of Burgundy, which Robert claimed on the death of his uncle, Duke Henry, in ioor. The other daimant, however, Otto WUliam, count of upper Burgundy, or Franche Comté, offered so stubborn a resistance that it was not until roi5 that the king secured the duchy, which he gave as an apanage to his son Henry. Nevertheless, Robert himself kept a close oversight over its government, and this was one reason which led to the revolt of .his sons in r030. Owring to family quarrels, he could not prevent the kingdom of Burgundy, or Arles, from passing into the hands of the emperor Conrad II., and no serious results followed his interference in Flanders or in Lorraine. Robert added to the royal domains, and was greatly aided by the support of Richard II. and Richard III., dukes of Normandy, the latter of whom was his son-in-law.</p><p>His life was written by his chaplain, Helgaud, and this panegyric, <hi rend="italic">Epitoma vitae Roberti regis,</hi>  is published by J.

But his efforts, like those of his father and grandfather, proved fruitless, and the Angevins were compelled at last to agree to the peace of CaltabeUotta (1302). On the death of Charles in 1309 Robert succeeded to the throne, although his nephew Caroberto (Carlo Roberto), son of his elder brother Charles Martel, who had died before his father, had a prior claim. Hewas crotvned by Pope Clement V. at Avignon, and on the descent into Italy of the emperor Henry VII. was appointed papal vicar in Romagna to resist the imperiaUsts; thenceforth he became the recognized leader of the Guelphs or papal faction in Italy and took part in aU the wars against the GhibelUnes. On various occasions he obtained for himself or his sons the suzerainty over Rome, Florence, and other cities, and was regarded as the most powerful Italian prince of his day. Pope John XXIL created him papal vicar in Italy against the emperor Louis the Bavarian. In r32o Robert summoned his kinsman PhiUpV. of France to Italy, and he waged war against Sicily once more from 1325 to rj4r, but failed to drive out the Aragonese.
