<p><span class="font0">merse eggs in oil or melted fat ; by which means, not be- ing exposed to the air or to frost, they are well preserved, and contract no bad taste or smell. Another experiment, still&nbsp;more important, made by our author, was to introduce into&nbsp;France the art of hatching fowls and birds, as practised in&nbsp;Egypt, without covering the eggs. Active, sedulous, and&nbsp;attentive, he was early in his study, often at six in the&nbsp;morning. Exact in his experiments and observations, he&nbsp;let no circumstance escape him. His writings must be of&nbsp;great use to future philosophers. In society he was distinguished through life for his modest and agreeable behaviour. His probity, benevolence, goodness of heart, and&nbsp;other amiable qualities, as well natural as acquired, endeared him to his countrymen. He died in the seventy-sixth&nbsp;year of his age, on the 18th of October 1757, and left this&nbsp;world filled with sentiments of piety. His death was the&nbsp;consequence of a fall, which happened at the castle of Bar-nardière on the Maine, where he went to pass his vocation.&nbsp;He bequeathed to the Academy of Sciences his manuscripts&nbsp;and all his natural productions. His works are, 1. A very&nbsp;great number of memoirs, and observations on different parts&nbsp;of natural history, printed in the collections of the Academy&nbsp;of Sciences; and, 2. A large work printed separately in six&nbsp;vols. 4to, entitled a Natural History of Insects. This important work contains a description of vast numbers of caterpillars, moths, gall-insects, flies with two and four wings,&nbsp;lady-birds, and those ephemeron flies which live only in that&nbsp;form a few hours ; and, lastly, of those singular and wonderful insects which are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">polypes,</span><span class="font0"> which being cut into&nbsp;several pieces, each piece lives, grows, and becomes an insect, and affords to our eyes a great number of prodigies.&nbsp;The works of M. de Reaumur are exact, curious, interesting,&nbsp;and exceedingly ingenious. They are written with much candour, clearness, and elegance ; but it must be acknowledged&nbsp;that his manner is somewhat too diffuse. We must not deceive the reader. He often raises our expectations, and does&nbsp;not give us all the satisfaction which we promise ourselves&nbsp;from his writings. His method of raising poultry, in particular, rather disappoints us. He spared neither care,&nbsp;time, nor expense, to render it practicable. He flattered&nbsp;himself and his countrymen with the greatest hopes ; but,&nbsp;notwithstanding his assiduous industry and vast charges, it&nbsp;proved abortive. M. PAdvocat recommended him to ob</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tain from Egypt better information on the subject, and if possible to procure a person versed in the art to instruct&nbsp;him in it ; but his death prevented the completion of the&nbsp;scheme. If any native of Egypt had arrived, showed M.&nbsp;de Reaumur a better method than his own, and practised&nbsp;it with success, as in his country, the community would&nbsp;have been benefited ; on the other hand, he would have&nbsp;seen, if it had tailed, that the climate of France was not&nbsp;proper for such experiments. M. Maillet, consul at Cairo,&nbsp;to whom the regent had written to obtain the art, offered&nbsp;to send over a native of Egypt, if the government would&nbsp;pay the expense of his voyage, and allow him a pension of&nbsp;1500 livres. M. Mailletjudged rightly when he preferred&nbsp;this method of proceeding. M. de Reaumur was not ignorant of the design, but he flattered himself that his efforts&nbsp;would be successful without further aid, and thought he&nbsp;should acquire some honour. He certainly had great talents, industry, sagacity, and every other requisite which is&nbsp;necessary in such attempts ; but it is morally impossible&nbsp;that a single man, in a different climate, can attain such&nbsp;knowledge in an art as those who live in a more favourable&nbsp;country, and have had the experience of many ages to profit by. Yet, however unsuccessful M. de Reaumur may&nbsp;have been, posterity is indebted to him for his repeated trials.&nbsp;He has removed some difficulties in the road, and those who&nbsp;travel it may discover what he only saw at a distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REBATE, or Rebatement, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Commerce,</span><span class="font0"> a term much used at Amsterdam for an abatement in the price of seve-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VOL. XIX.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ral commodities, when the buyer, instead of taking time, advances ready money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rebatement, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heraldry,</span><span class="font0"> a diminution or abatement of the bearings in a coat of arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REBELLION, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rebellio,</span><span class="font0"> amongst the Romans, was where those who had been formerly overcome in battle, and yielded to their subjection, made a second resistance. But with&nbsp;us it is generally used for the taking up of arms traitorously against the king, whether by natural subjects or others&nbsp;when once subdued ; and the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rebel</span><span class="font0"> is sometimes applied to him who wilfidly breaks a law, as also to a villein&nbsp;disobeying his lord.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is a difference between enemies and rebels. Enemies are those who are out of the king’s allegiance ; and therefore subjects of the king, either in open war or rebellion, are not the king’s enemies, but traitors. Thus David&nbsp;prince of Wales, who levied war against Edward L<sub>1</sub> because he was within the allegiance of the king, had sentence pronounced against him as a traitor and a rebel. Private persons may arm themselves to suppress rebels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REBUS, an enigmatical representation of some name or thing, by using figures or pictures instead of words or parts&nbsp;of words. Camden mentions an instance of this kind of&nbsp;wit in a gallant who expressed his love to a woman named&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rose Hill,</span><span class="font0"> by painting in the border of his gown a rose, a&nbsp;hill, an eye, a loaf, and a well ; which, in the style of the&nbsp;rebus, reads, “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rose Hill I lave well.”</span><span class="font0"> This kind of wit&nbsp;was long practised by the great, who took the pains to find&nbsp;devices for their names. It was, however, happily ridiculed&nbsp;by Ben Jonson in the humorous description of AbelDrug-ger’s device in the Alchemist, by the Spectator in the device of Jack of Newberry, at which time the rebus, being&nbsp;raised to sign-posts, was grown out of fashion at court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rebus is also used by the chemical writers, sometimes to signify sour milk, and sometimes for what they call the ultimate matter of which all bodies are composed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rebus, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heraldry,</span><span class="font0"> is a coat of arms which bears an allusion to the name of the person ; as three castles for Castleton, three cups for Butler, three conics for Conisby ; a kind of bearings which are of great antiquity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RECANATI, a city of Italy, in the delegation of Macerata, in the papal dominions. It is situated on a mountain overlooking the Adriatic Sea. It is the seat of a bishop in union with the city of Loretto, and has a cathedral, eight parish churches, eight monasteries, and four nunneries. It is well built, and has a haven at the mouth of the&nbsp;Potenza, with a population of 5990 persons. Long. 13. 27.&nbsp;48. E. Lat. 43. 25. 40. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RECENSIO was an account taken by the censors, every lustrum, of all the Roman people. It was a general survey,&nbsp;at which the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">equites,</span><span class="font0"> as well as the rest of the people, were&nbsp;required to appear. New names were now put upon the&nbsp;censor’s list, and old ones cancelled. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">recensio,</span><span class="font0"> in short,&nbsp;was a more solemn and accurate sort of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">probatio,</span><span class="font0"> and answered the purpose of a review, by showing who were fit&nbsp;for military service.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RECHÀBITES, a kind of religious order amongst the ancient Jews, instituted by Jonadab the son of Rechab,&nbsp;comprehending only his own family and posterity. Their&nbsp;Ibimder prescribed them three things : first, not to drink&nbsp;any wine ; secondly, not to build any houses, but to dwell&nbsp;in tents ; and, thirdly, not to sow any corn or plant vines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RECHEAT, in hunting, a lesson which the huntsman plays on the horn, when the hounds have lost their game,&nbsp;to call them back from pursuing a counter scent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RECHERCHE Archipelago, agroup of islands stretching about 126 miles along the south coast of New Holland, between the thirty-third and thirty-fourth degrees of south&nbsp;latitude. Several of them are naked rocks; and from the&nbsp;coast of New Holland the access is extremely difficult, owing&nbsp;to the rocks and shoals that are interspersed.</span></p>
