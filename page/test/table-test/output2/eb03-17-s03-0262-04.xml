in eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, a name anciently, and even at this day, given to ſuch as retain ſome tincture of Pelagianiſm. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Pelagians.</hi></p><p>Caſſian, who had been a deacon of Conſtantinople, and was afterwards a prieſt at Marſeilles, was the chief of theſe Semipelagians ; whoſe leading principles were,</p><p>1. That God did not diſpenſe his grace to one more than another in conſequence of predeſtination, i. e. an eternal and abſolute decree, but was willing to ſave all men, if they complied with the terms of his goſpel.</p><p>2. That Chriſt died for all men. 3. That the grace purchaſed by Chriſt, and neceſſary to ſalvation, was offered to all men. 4. That man, before he received grace, was capable of faith and holy deſires. 5. That man was born free, and was conſequently capable of refitting the influences of grace, or of complying with its fuggeſtion. The Semipelagians were very numerous ; and the doctrine of Caſſian, though variouſly explained, was received in the greateſt part of the monaſtic ſchools in Gaul, from whence it ſpread itſelf far and wide thro'</p><p>the European provinces. As to the Greeks and other eaſtern Chriſtians, they had embraced the Semipelagian doctrines before Caſſian, and ſtill adhere to them. In the 6th century, the controverſy between the Semipelagians and the diſciples of Auguſtin prevailed much, and continued to divide the weſtern churches.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
