<p><span class="font3">The reſults of theſe experiments were as-conformable to the theory as could be wiſhed. The reſiſtance was&nbsp;always a little leſs than wſhat the theory required, but&nbsp;greatly exceeded its half ; the reſult of the generally re-ceived theories. This defcct ſhould be expected ; for&nbsp;the demonſtration ſuppoſes· the plane MN to be infinitely extended, fo that the film of water which iffues&nbsp;through the chink may be accurately parallel to the&nbsp;plane. This never can be completely effected. Alſo&nbsp;it was ſuppoſed, that the velocity was juſtly meaſured&nbsp;by the amplitude of the parabola EGK. But it is well&nbsp;known that the. very putting the plane MN in the way&nbsp;of the jet, though at the diſtance of an inch from the&nbsp;orifice, will diminiſh the velocity, of the efflux through&nbsp;this orifice. This is eaſily verified by experiment, 05-ferve the time in which the veſſel will be emptied when&nbsp;there is no plane in the way. Repeat the experiment&nbsp;.with the plane in its place ; and more time will be ne-ceſſary. The following is a note of a courſe of ex-periments, taken as they ſtand, without any ſelection.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">In order to demonſtrate this propofition in ſuch a manner as to furniſh the means of inveſtigating the&nbsp;jwhole mechaniſm and action of moving fluids, it is neceffary to premife an elementary theorem of curvilineal&nbsp;motions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If .a particle of matter deſcribes a curve line ABCE (fig. 13∙) by the continual action of deflecting forces,&nbsp;which vary in any manner, both with reſpect to inten-fity and direction, and if the action of thfeſe forces, in&nbsp;.every point of the curve, be reſolved into two directions, perpendicular and parallel to the initial direction&nbsp;AK; then,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">i. The accumulated effect of the deflecting forces, eſtimated in a direction AD perpendicular to AK, is&nbsp;to the final quantity of motion as the fine of the final&nbsp;change of direction is to radius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Let us ſirſt fuppofe that the accelerating forces act by ſtarts, at equal intervals of time, when the body&nbsp;is in the points A, B, C, E. And let AN be the de-flecting force, which, acting at A, changes the origi-nal direction AK to AB. Produce AB till BH=&nbsp;AB, and complete the parallelogram BFCH. Then&nbsp;FB is the force which, by acting at B, changed the&nbsp;motion BH (the continuation of AB) to BC. In&nbsp;like manner make </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ch</span><span class="font3"> (in BC produced) equal to BC,&nbsp;and complete the parallelogram C/EÂ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cſ</span><span class="font3"> is the&nbsp;deflecting force at C, &amp;c. Draw BO parallel to AN, and&nbsp;GBK perpendicular to AK. Alſo draw lines through&nbsp;C and E perpendicular to AK, and draw through B&nbsp;and C lines parallel to AK. Draw alſo HL, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h∕</span><span class="font3">per-pendicular, and FG, HI, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">hi,</span><span class="font3"> parallel to AK.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It is plain that BK is BO or AN eſtimated in the direction perpendicular to AK, and that BG is BF&nbsp;eſtimated in the ſame way. And fince BH = AB, HL&nbsp;or IM is equal to BK. Alſo CI is equal to BG.&nbsp;Therefore CM is equal to AP+BG. By ſimilar rea-ſcning it appears that E∕w = Ez-f-Z&gt;∕,=∑C⅛<sup>r</sup>4-CM, =&nbsp;C^~f-BG, ſt-AP.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Therefore if CE be taken for the meaſure of the final velocity or quantity of motion, Em will be the&nbsp;accumulated effect of the deflecting forces eſtimated in&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">the direction </span><span class="font3">AD perpendicular </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">to AK.

<p><span class="font3">to CE as the fine </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of mCE </span><span class="font3">is to radius; and the angle wCE is the angle contained between the initial and&nbsp;final directions, becauſe </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cm</span><span class="font3"> is parallel to AK. Now&nbsp;let the intervals of time diminiſh continually and the&nbsp;frequency of the impulſes increaſe. The deflection be-eomes ultimately continuous, and the motion curvili*&nbsp;iieal, and the propofition is demonfl rated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">we ſee that the initial velocity and its ſubſequent changes do not affect the conclufion, which depends&nbsp;entirely on the final quantity of motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">2.</span><span class="font3"> The accumulated effect of the accelerating forces, when eſtimated in the direction AK of the original&nbsp;motion, or in the oppofite direction, is equal to the&nbsp;difference between the initial quantity of motion and the&nbsp;product of the final quantity of motion by the cofine&nbsp;of the change of direction.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cor.</span><span class="font3"> I. The ſame action, in the direction oppofite to that of the original motion, is neceffary for caufing&nbsp;a body to move at right angles to its former direction&nbsp;as for ſtopping its motion. For in this caſe, the co-fine of the change of direction is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">— 0,</span><span class="font3"> and A Ο—CE&nbsp;×cofine ECM=Ao—ο, “ΑΟ, = the original motion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cor. 2.</span><span class="font3"> If the initial and final velocities are the ſame, the accumulated action of the accelerating forces, eſti-mated in the direction OA, is equal to the product of&nbsp;the original quantity of motion by the verſed fine of&nbsp;the change of direction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The application of theſe theorems, particularly the ſecond, to our preſent purpoſe is very obvious. All the&nbsp;filaments of the jet were originally moving in the direction of its axis, and they are finally moving along the&nbsp;reſiſting plane, or perpendicular to their former motion.&nbsp;Therefore their tranſverſe forces in the direction of th&lt;s&nbsp;axis are </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(in cumulo)</span><span class="font3"> equal to the force which would&nbsp;ſtop the motion. For the aggregate of the ſimulta-neous forces of every particle in the whole filament is&nbsp;the ſame with that of the ſucceſſive forces of one particle,&nbsp;as it arrives at different points of its curvineal path.&nbsp;All the tranſverſe forces, eſtimated in a direction per-pendicular to the axis of the vein, preciſely balance and&nbsp;ſuſtain each other; and the only forces which can pro-duce a ſenſtble effect are thoſe in a direction parallel&nbsp;to the axis. By theſe all the inner filaments are preſſed towards the plane MN, and muſt be withſtood by it.&nbsp;It is highly probable, nay certain, that there is a quantity&nbsp;of ſtagnant water in the middle of the vein which ſuſtains&nbsp;the preffures of the moving filaments without it, and&nbsp;tranſmits it to the ſolid plane. But this does not alter&nbsp;the caſe. And, fortunately^ it is of no conſequence&nbsp;what changes happen in the velocities of the particles&nbsp;while each is deſcribing its own curve. And it is from&nbsp;this circumſtance, peculiar to this particular caſe of per-peudicular impulſe, that we are able to draw the con-clufion. It is by no means difficult to demonſtrate that&nbsp;the velocity of the external ſurface of this jet is con-ſtant, and indeed of every jet which is not acted on by&nbsp;external forces after it has quitted the orifice : but this&nbsp;diſcuſſion is quite unneceffary here. It is however extremely difficult to aſcertain, even in this moſt fimp<sup>,</sup>e</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
