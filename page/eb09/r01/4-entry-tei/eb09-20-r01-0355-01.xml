<hi rend="smallcaps">Adrian,</hi> a meritorious Dutch Orientalist, was born at Ryp, July 17, 1676, studied at Utrecht and Leyden and successively professed Oriental languages with great success at Harderwijk (1699) and Utrecht (1701). In the latter chair, from which he also lectured on sacred antiquities, he remained till he died of small-pox February 5, 1718.</p><p>Reland’s most important work is <hi rend="italic">Palestina ex vcteribus monu-mcntis illustrata,</hi> Utrecht, 1714, an admirable collection which is still the most valuable book on the historical geography of the Holy Land. His <hi rend="italic">Antiquilates sacras veterum Ilebraeorurn,</hi> learned, clear, and compact, is also a most useful book; and his other writings and collections—for he reprinted many curious and useful tracts of other scholars on Biblical and Rabbinical topics—all show judgment as well as knowledge. His works are enumerated by Burmau, <hi rend="italic">Traj. Erud.,</hi> p. 296 <hi rend="italic">sq.</hi></p>
