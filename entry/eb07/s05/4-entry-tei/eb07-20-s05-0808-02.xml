a large island in the Eastern Seas, about 180 miles in length by forty in average breadth. It is situated between the eighth and ninth degrees of south latitude, and is separated from Lombhook by the Straits of Allass. It is almost divided into two equal parts by a deep bay, which indents it in the middle. This island is divided into the different states of Beema, Dompoo, Tambora, San- gur, Pekat, and Sumbawa, all governed by their respective chiefs, who were formerly either allies or under the protection of the Dutch East India Company, and were all sufficiently obedient, with the exception of the chief of Sumbawa, who rebelled. Near the north-east end of the island, on a fine bay which stretches seven or eight leagues south, is situated the town of Beema, remarkable for its excellent harbour, the sides of which are bold and high, and the approach safe; but the passage through is sometimes dangerous, from the strong current which generally prevails, and the great depth of water, as 100 fathoms of line, though close in shore, will hardly reach the bottom. The channel in some places is only 150 or 200 yards across ; but the depth is so great that a ship of the line may sail on either side within thirty yards of the rocky mountains. These give a grand and picturesque appearance to the channel, which terminates in a safe and commodious basin, presenting one of the finest harbours in the world. On the east side of the bay stands the town of Beema, which comprehends under its jurisdiction the Straits of Sapy, the whole of Manzeray, and the island of Gonong Api. The island produces sappan wood, rice, horses, saltpetre, sulphur, wax, birdsâ€™ nests, tobacco, &amp;c., though there is but little trade carried on at this place. The number of horses exported under the appellation of Beema horses is very considerable. There are two volcanic mountains in the island, Gonong Api and another, which are looked upon with superstitious veneration by the inhabitants. Gold-dust is found in Sumbawa, particularly in the district of Dompoo, which also supplies teak-timber. Pearls are fished for in the large bay to the westward of Beema Bay, as also at Pekat.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
