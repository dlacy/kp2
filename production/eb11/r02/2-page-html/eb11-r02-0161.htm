<p><span class="font1">paroxysmal nature, to whIch the term cardiac asthma has been applied. Similarly, to a form of dyspnoea met with occasionally&nbsp;as a manifestation of uraemia in chronic Bright’s disease the&nbsp;term of renal asthma has been given.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pleurisy, or inflammation of the pleura, is a very common affection, and is met with under different forms. In many&nbsp;instances we have simply the pouring out, over a&nbsp;greater or less area of the surface of the pleura,&nbsp;of a fibrinous exudation which may become absorbed or&nbsp;undergo organisation, a certain amount of thickening of the&nbsp;pleura, and adhesions of the two layers resulting. Such cases&nbsp;form the group known as cases of dry pleurisy. In other&nbsp;instances a greater or lesser amount of serous exudation takes&nbsp;place into one or other pleural cavity, forming the cases of&nbsp;serous pleuritic effusion. In others the exudation into the&nbsp;pleural cavity is purulent, giving rise to the condition known&nbsp;as empyema or purulent pleuritic effusion. The occurrence&nbsp;of dry pleurisy is probably very frequent, and leads to small&nbsp;pleural adhesions which cause little or no inconvenience. In&nbsp;post-mortem examinations of persons who have died from&nbsp;various diseases it is common to find such pleural adhesions&nbsp;present, although they have never been suspected during life.&nbsp;Pleurisy in one or other of the above forms may come on in a&nbsp;person apparently in good health (idiopathic pleurisy), or it may&nbsp;follow a fracture of the ribs or other injury to the chest. It is&nbsp;not uncommonly secondary to some other disease; thus it is&nbsp;almost a constant accompaniment of acute lobar pneumonia.&nbsp;In such cases the effusion is most commonly a simple fibrinous&nbsp;one, which with the subsidence of the primary disease is in&nbsp;great part absorbed. In other cases of pneumonia we get a&nbsp;certain amount of serous effusion into the pleura; and sometimes, especially in children, thc pneumonia is followed by the&nbsp;development of an empyema. Pleurisy with effusion is also&nbsp;frequently a complication of valvular heart disease and dilatation&nbsp;of the heart, and in such cases is often associated with the formation of superficial pulmonary infarcts. It is also seen in many&nbsp;other diseases of the lungs. For instance, in chronic pulmonary&nbsp;phthisis pleuritic adhesions over various parts of the lungs are&nbsp;the rule; and we also frequently get serous effusion into the&nbsp;pleura as a complication of the various forms of pulmonary&nbsp;tuberculosis. Purulent effusion is less common in phthisis,&nbsp;but it is the rule where the pleura is perforated by the necrosis&nbsp;of a tuberculous focus in the lung and the establishment of a&nbsp;communication between the pleura and a tuberculous cavity&nbsp;and the bronchial tubes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(pyopneumonothorax)</span><span class="font1">, a combination in&nbsp;which there is both air and pus in the pleural cavity. Secondary&nbsp;pleurisy is also seen in an extension of the disease from neighbouring parts, as from peritonitis, sub-diaphragmatic abscess,&nbsp;and suppuration in the liver or spleen. As a secondary disease,&nbsp;pleurisy is also known in the course of various forms of nephritis,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rheumatism, and the acute specific diseases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cases formerly classed as idiopathic pleurisy are now Tcnown to be caused by certain micro-organisms. These vary in relation to the character of the effusion. The most frequent is the&nbsp;tubercle bacillus, which is generally present in sero-fibrinous&nbsp;effusions. In this case the pleurisy is really secondary to a&nbsp;possibly unrecognized tuberculous infection either of the lung&nbsp;or pleura. In purulent effusions the pneumococcus may occur&nbsp;as a pure infection, or the streptococcus pyogenes or the staphylococcus may be present. Mixed infections occur in 21% of&nbsp;purulent effusions, and varieties of other organisms, such as the&nbsp;influenza bacillus, the typhoid bacillus, the Klebs-Loffler&nbsp;bacillus and the colon bacillus, have been occasionally found.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are at least five types of pulmonary emphysema;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hypertrophic, idiopathic or large-lunged emphysema;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;senile or small-lunged emphysema; (3) compensatory&nbsp;emphysema; (4) acute vesicular emphysema; (5) interstitial&nbsp;or interlobular emphysema. Two points are usually admitted:&nbsp;that emphysema appears only in lungs that are congenitally&nbsp;weak, and that the exciting cause is increased Intravesicular&nbsp;tension. When one or more lobules are cut off from the working&nbsp;part of the lung the neighbouring vesicles become distended.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Should the plugging of thc lobule remain permanent, typical emphysema results. This happens in illnesses inducing violent&nbsp;respiratory efforts, such as chronic bronchitis, whooping cough&nbsp;and asthma. In large-lunged emphysema the lung is excessively&nbsp;large, and does not collapse on opening the chest wall. Microscopically two lesions are notable. -The septa between the&nbsp;vesicles are atrophied, many have disappeared and the vesicles&nbsp;have coalesced; the loss in lung tissue diminishes the vascular&nbsp;field of the lung and tends to imperfect aeration, whence thc&nbsp;dyspnoea. The elastic tissue of the lung is also lost. In small-lunged emphysema there is a condition of senile atrophy. The&nbsp;lung is smaller than normal, and the intravesicular septa are&nbsp;destroyed. In this case the primary cause is atrophy of the&nbsp;bronchi, and increased air pressure is not a factor. Compensatory emphysema is that which develops in a portion of a&nbsp;lung in which the other portion is the seat of a lesion, such as&nbsp;pneumonia. Occasionally it is merely physiological, but sometimes here too the septa undergo atrophic changes. Acute&nbsp;vesicular emphysema is hardly a pathological variety, and is&nbsp;really rapid distension coming on during an attack of asthma&nbsp;or angina pectoris. The variety is temporary only. Interstitial&nbsp;emphysema is characterized by the presence of air in the interstitial connective tissue of the lung. It is usually due to rupture&nbsp;of the air vesicles during paroxysms of coughing.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">(5) Surgery of the Respiratory System</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About the middle of the 19th century, Manuel Garcia demonstrated the working of the vocal cords in the living subject, by placing a flat mirror of about the size of a shilling at the back of&nbsp;the mouth, and throwing strong light on to it from a concave&nbsp;mirror fixed upon the observer’s forehead. By the use of a&nbsp;laryngoscope and a cocaine spray the most irritable throat can&nbsp;now be made tolerant of the presence of the small mirror, and&nbsp;thus the medical man is enabled to make a prolonged and&nbsp;thorough examination of the interior of the larynx and even to&nbsp;perform delicate operations upon it. Foreign bodies which have&nbsp;become caught in the larynx can thus be seen and extracted,&nbsp;and small growths can be satisfactorily removed even from&nbsp;the vocal cords themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A foreign body in the air-passages</span><span class="font1"> may be impacted above the vocal cords, and the prompt thrusting down of a finger may&nbsp;dislodge it and save the person from death by suffocation. If&nbsp;there is doubt as to thc site of the impaction, and the symptoms&nbsp;are urgent (as is likely to be the case) immediate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iaryngotomy&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">should be done. In this operation a tube is introduced through&nbsp;the crevice which can easily be felt Inthemiddlelineoftheneck,&nbsp;between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages. The procedure is&nbsp;easily and quickly accomplished. It is, moreover,often resorted&nbsp;to when the surgeon is about to perform some extensive operation in the mouth which must needs be accompanied by free&nbsp;haemorrhage. Laryngotomy having been done, and the&nbsp;pharynx having been plugged with gauze, the air passages can&nbsp;be kept free of blood during the whole operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">If the foreign body be such a thing as a button, cherry-stone, sugar-plum or coin, it may at once set up alarming symptoms&nbsp;of spasmodic suffocation. But when the first alarm has quieted&nbsp;down, the attacks are likely to be only occasional, as when the&nbsp;article, drawn up with the expired air, comes in contact with&nbsp;the under aspect of the vocal cords. It may be that in a violent&nbsp;fit of coughing it will be expelled, but, if not, the surgeon must&nbsp;be at hand ready to perform tracheotomy when the urgency of&nbsp;the symptoms demands it. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tracheotomy</span><span class="font1"> is the making of an&nbsp;opening into the trachea, the air-tube below the larynx. It is&nbsp;unsafe to leave a child with a foreign body loose in its windpipe,&nbsp;on account of the risk of sudden and fatal asphyxia. Possibly&nbsp;the X-rays may show its exact position and give help in its&nbsp;removal. But, in any case, the safest thing will be to perform&nbsp;tracheotomy and to leave the edges of the opening into thc&nbsp;windpipe wide asunder, so that the object may be coughed out&nbsp;—the nurse being on guard all the while. The operation of&nbsp;tracheotomy is sometimes urgently called for in the case in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
