Secundus is said to have written verses when but ten years old ; and from the vast quantity which he left behind him, we have reason to conclude that such writing constituted his principal employment. He found time, however, to carve figures of all his own family, of his mistresses, of the Emperor Charles V., of several eminent personages of those times, and of many of his intimate friends ; and in the last edition of his works, published by Scriverius, at Leyden, 1631, there is a print of one of his mistresses with this inscription around it : <hi rend="italic">Vatis amatoris Julia sculpta manu.</hi></p><p>Secundus having nearly attained the age of twenty-one, and being determined, as it would seem, to comply as far as possible with the wishes of his father, quitted Mechelen, and went to France, where, at Bourges, a city in the Or- leannois, he studied the civil law under the celebrated Andreas Alciatus. Alciatus was one of the most learned civilians of that age ; but that which undoubtedly endeared him much more to our author, was his general acquaintance with polite literature, and more particularly his taste in poetry. Having studied a year under this eminent professor, and taken his degrees, Secundus returned to Mechelen, where he remained only a very few months. In 1533 he went into Spain with warm recommendations to the Count of Nassau and other persons of high rank ; and soon afterwards he became secretary to the cardinal archbishop of Toledo, in a department of business which required no other qualifications than what he possessed in a very eminent degree, a facility in writing with elegance the Latin language. It was during his residence with this cardinal that he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Basia,</hi> a series of wanton poems, of which the fifth, seventh, and ninth <hi rend="italic">carmina</hi> of Catullus seem to have given the hint. Secundus was not, however, a servile imitator of Catullus. His expressions seem to be borrowed rather from Tibullus and Propertius; and in the warmth of his descriptions he surpasses every thing that has been written on similar subjects by Catullus, Tibullus, Propertius, C. Gallus, Ovid, or Horace.</p><p>In 1535 he accompanied the Emperor Charles V. to the siege of Tunis, but gained few laurels as a soldier. The hardships which were endured at that memorable siege were but little suited to the soft disposition of a votary of Venus and the muses ; and upon an enterprise which might have furnished ample matter for an epic poem, it is remarkable that Secundus wrote nothing which has been deemed worthy of preservation. Having returned from his martial expedition, he was sent by the cardinal to Rome to congratulate the pope upon the success of the emperor’s arms, but was taken so ill on the road, that he was not able to complete his journey. He was advised to seek, without a moment’s delay, the benefit of his native air ; and that happily recovered him.</p><p>Having now quitted the service of the archbishop of Toledo, Secundus was employed in the same office of secretary by the bishop of Utrecht; and so much had he hitherto distinguished himself by the classical elegance of his compositions, that he was soon called upon to fill the important post of private Latin secretary to the emperor, who was then in Italy. This was the most honourable office to which our author was ever appointed ; but before he could enter upon it, death put a stop to his career of glory. Having arrived at Saint Amand, in the district of Tournay, in order to meet, upon business, with the bishop of Utrecht, he was, upon the 8th of October 1536, cut off by a violent fever, in the very flower of his age, not having quite completed his twenty-fifth year. He was interred in the church of the Benedictines, of which his patron the bishop was abbot; and his near relations erected to his memory a marble monument, with a plain Latin inscription.</p><p>The works of Secundus have gone through several editions, of which the best and most copious is that of Scriverius already mentioned. It consists of, 1. Julia, eleg. lib. i. ; 2. Amores, eleg. lib. it. ; 3. Ad Diversos, eleg. lib. iii. ; 4. Basia, styled by the editor <hi rend="italic">incomparabilis er divinus prorsus liber ;</hi> 5. Epigrammata ; 6. Odarum liber unus ; 7. Epistolarum liber unus ; 8. Epistolarum liber alter, heroico carmine scriptus; 9. Funerum liber unus; 10. Sylvie et Carminum fragmenta ; 11. Poemata nonnulla fratrum ; 12. Itineraria Secundi tria; 13. Epistolæ totidem, soluta oratione. Of these works it would be superfluous in us to give any character, after the ample testimonies prefixed to them by Lelius Greg. Gyraldus, the elder Scaliger, Theodore Beza, and others equally celebrated in the republic of letters, who all speak of them as excellent.</p><p>SECUTORES, a species of gladiators among the Romans, whose arms were a helmet, a shield, and a sword or a leaden bullet. They were armed in this manner, because they had to contend with the retiarii, who were dressed in a short tunic, and bore a three-pointed lance in their left hand, and a net in their right. The retiariue attempted to cast his net over the head of the secutor ; and if he succeeded, he drew it together and slew him with his trident ; but if he missed his aim, he immediately betook himself to flight, till he could find a second opportunity of entangling his adversary with his net. He was pursued by the secutor, who endeavoured to despatch him in his flight.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Secutores </hi>was<hi rend="italic">,</hi> also a name given to such gladiators as took the place of those that were killed in the combat, or who engaged the conqueror. This post was usually taken by lot.</p><p>SEDAN, an arrondissement of the department of the Ardennes, in France, extending over 278 square miles, divided into four cantons and eighty-two communes, with, in the year 1836, 63,233 inhabitants. The capital is the fortified city of the same name, situated on the river Meuse. It is celebrated for its cloth manufactures, especially those of black ; and it has also some considerable establishments for making cannon, muskets, and other arms, as well as other kinds of hardware, and china. In the same year its population amounted to 13,719. It was the birthplace of the celebrated Turenne. Long. 4. 52. 31. E. Lat. 49. 22. 29. N.</p><p>SEDAN-CHAIR is a covered vehicle for carrying a single person, being suspended by two poles, and borne by two men, who are hence denominated <hi rend="italic">chairmen.</hi> They were first introduced into London in 1634, when Sir Sanders Duncomb obtained the sole privilege to use, let, and hire a number of the said covered chairs for fourteen years.</p><p>SEDASIER, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Mysore, and district of Coorg. In 1799 the troops of Tippoo Sultan were here defeated by the British. It is seven miles north-west of Periapatam.</p><p>SEDBERGH, a town in the wapentake of Staincliff and Ewcross, in the west riding of the county of York, 271 miles from London. It is situated on the borders of Westmoreland, at the foot of the Houghill Fells. It has a market, which is held on Thursday. The population amounted in 1821 to 4483, and in 1831 to 4711.</p><p>SEDHOUT, a district in the Balaghaut ceded territories, situated principally between the fourteenth and fifteenth degrees of north latitude. It lies immediately within the Eastern Ghauts. It is a rocky and mountainous region, indifferently cultivated, but interspersed with fertile valleys. The chief river is the Pennar, and the principal town is Odegherry. The fortress of Sedhout, the capital of the above district, was taken by Meer Jumla about the year 1650. At this period Sedhout and the adjoining district were celebrated for their diamond mines, which, however, are no longer worked.</p><p>SEDITION, among civilians, is used for a factious com-</p></body></text></TEI>
