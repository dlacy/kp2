<p><label>RIDGE</label>
(a word common to many Teutonic languages, meaning “ back,” whether of a man or an animal, cf. German <hi rend="italic">Rücke),</hi> the word applied to many objects resembling the projecting line of an animal's back, such as the strip of soil thrown up by a plough between furrows, the elevations or protuberances on bones which serve for the attachment of muscles or ligaments, &amp;c. In architecture the ridge (Fr. <hi rend="italic">faite, crête,</hi> Gr. <hi rend="italic">First;</hi> ItaL <hi rend="italic">asinello)</hi> is the highest portion of a roof, which is covered with lead, slate, or tiles, and sometimes decorated with a cresting in terra-cotta or metal-work. The term is also applied to the meeting of the common rafters on each side of a roof, which are sometimes butted against an upright board known as the ridge-piece. For the ridge-rib see <hi rend="smallcaps">Rib.</hi></p>
