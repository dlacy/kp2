RABBI
or Rabbins, a title which the Pharisees and doctors of the law among the Jews assumed, and literally fignifies
mqflers
or
excellents.
There were several gradations before they arrived at the dignity of a rabbin ; which was not conferred till they had acquired the prcfoundest knowledge of the law and the traditions. It does not, however, appear that there was any fixed age or previous examination nccessary ; but when a man had distinguished himsels by his skill in the written and oral law, and passed through the subordinate degrees, he was faluted a rabbin by the public voice.
Among the modern Jews, for near 700 years past, the learned men retain no other title than that of
rabbi,
or
rabbins
; they have great respect paid them, have the first places or seats in their synagogues, determine all matters of controversy, and frequently pronounce upon civil affairs ; they have even power
f o
excommunicate the disobedient.
