<p><span class="font3">disease is reached, the patients cease to suffer pain, and are inconvenienced only by the deformities in the· limbs, in which a&nbsp;considerable degree of motion may be retained. Remarkable&nbsp;deformities are seen in hands in which a considerable amount&nbsp;of usefulness still remains. Dyspepsia and anaemia are frequently associated with arthritis. Monarticular arthritis more&nbsp;particularly affects the aged; and when it affects the hip is&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">morbus coxae senilis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The atrophic form of arthritis is not very common. The&nbsp;chief anatomical change is due to atrophy in the bone and cartilage.&nbsp;The disease occurs at an earlier period in life than the peri-articular&nbsp;form, from which the initial symptoms do not markedly differ;&nbsp;but the disorganization in the joint is greater, dislocations&nbsp;frequently occur, and ankylosis of the joints follows. This is the&nbsp;most serious form of arthritis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the hypertrophic form the anatomical changes include&nbsp;the formation of new bone as well as changes in the cartilage.&nbsp;This new-bone formation may lead to progressive ankylosis in&nbsp;the joints. Should the, vertebral column be affected a rigid&nbsp;condition of the spine known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">spondylitis deformans</span><span class="font3"> (“ poker&nbsp;back ”) may ensue. What are termed “ Heberden’s nodes ”&nbsp;are small hard knobs about the size of a pea frequently found&nbsp;upon the fingers near the terminal phalangeal joints; they&nbsp;rarely give rise to symptoms. Popularly ascribed to gout, these&nbsp;nodes are in reality a manifestation of arthritis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">A variety of arthritis occurring in children is known as&nbsp;Still’s disease; in which the swelling of the joints is associated with&nbsp;swelling of the lymph glands and of the spleen. The onset is often&nbsp;acute, with fever and rigors; sweating is profuse and the joints&nbsp;are enlarged and painful. There may be much muscular&nbsp;wasting and limitation of movement in the joints, and anaemia&nbsp;is associated with the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The treatment of rheumatoid arthritis is rarely curative, once the disease has been permanently established; and it&nbsp;is therefore important to begin treatment before destructive&nbsp;changes have taken place in the joints. In the acute febrile&nbsp;form, which is frequently taken for rheumatism, the essential&nbsp;treatment is rest to the affected joints, with the application of&nbsp;oil of Wintergreen; the joint should not be fixed but supported.&nbsp;In the more chronic forms medicinal treatments are usually&nbsp;of little value. Potassium iodide is useful in some cases by&nbsp;promoting absorption of the hypertrophied fibrous tissue, and&nbsp;guaiacol if administered for a sufficiently long time is said to&nbsp;be capable of arresting the disease, diminishing the size of the&nbsp;joint and helping movement. Where anaemia accompanies the&nbsp;disease iron and arsenic are of value. The general health of a&nbsp;patient suffering from rheumatoid arthritis must be maintained,&nbsp;and he should live upon a dry soil. Visits to Aix-les-Bains,&nbsp;Buxtön, Bath or Droitwich, with their baths and shampooings,&nbsp;often prove useful, particularly when combined with gentle&nbsp;massage. It is a mistake to keep the joints entirely at rest&nbsp;in the chronic forms, as this tends to the formation of contractures&nbsp;and ankylosis. Moderate exercise without undue fatigue is&nbsp;desirable. Patients should go early to bed and have plenty of&nbsp;rest, sunshine and fresh air. It is important that the diet should&nbsp;be nourishing and plentiful, and should there be intestinal&nbsp;putrefaction fermented milk is useful. As regards the local&nbsp;treatment, it will be well in the majority of cases to determine&nbsp;by the X-rays the exact state of the affected joints. Radiant&nbsp;heat, vibration and hot-air baths are among the best treatments.&nbsp;The active hyperaemia induced by hot air favours restoration&nbsp;of movement and alleviates pain, but where there is pronounced&nbsp;destruction of bone and cartilage full restoration of a joint&nbsp;cannot take place. Systematic exercises of the joints tend to&nbsp;prevent the atrophy of the adjacent muscles, And Bier’s passive&nbsp;hyperaemia induced by the temporary use of an elastic bandage&nbsp;has the same results. Should an X-ray photograph reveal the&nbsp;presence of spurs or loose bodies in the joints interfering with&nbsp;free movement their removal is called for. Sometimes the&nbsp;breaking down of adhesions under an anaesthetic is necessary,&nbsp;and gentle passive and later active movements of the joints&nbsp;should follow if freedom of use is to be gained.

<p><span class="font3">RHEYDT, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine province, situated on the Nicrs, 19 m. W. of Düsseldorf, on the main line of railway to Aix-la-Chapelle, and at the junction of lines&nbsp;to’ Crefeld and Stolbcrg. Pop. (1905) 40,149. It has two&nbsp;Roman Catholic and two Evangelical churches,'a handsome&nbsp;new town hall (1895), <sup>a</sup> gymnasium, and several technical&nbsp;schools. The principal products of its numerous factories are&nbsp;silk, cotton, woollen and mixed fabrics, velvet, iron goods,&nbsp;machinery, shoes, cables, soap and cigars. Dyeing and finishing,&nbsp;brewing and distilling, are also carried on. Rheydt is an ancient&nbsp;place, but its industrial importance is of very recent growth,&nbsp;and it only received municipal rights in 1856.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">RHÏANUS, Greek poet and grammarian, a native of Crete, friend and contemporary of Eratosthenes (275-195 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C.).&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Suidas says he was at first a slave and overseer of a palaestra,&nbsp;but obtained a good education later in life, and devoted himself&nbsp;to grammatical studies, probably in Alexandria. He prepared a&nbsp;new recension of, the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey,</span><span class="font3"> characterized by sound&nbsp;judgment and poetical taste. His bold atheteses are frequently&nbsp;mentioned in the scholia. He also wrote epigrams, eleven of&nbsp;which, preserved in the Greek anthology and Athcnaeus, show&nbsp;elegance and vivacity.

<p><span class="font3">RHIGAS, CONSTANTINE, known as Rhigas </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font3">Velestinos (Pherac), or Rhigas Pheraios (1760-1798), Greek patriot and&nbsp;poet, was born at Velestinos, and was educated at Zagora and&nbsp;at Constantinople, where he became secretary to Alexander&nbsp;Ypsilanti. In 1786 he entered the service of Nicholas Mavro-genes, hospodar of Wallachia, at Bucharest, and when war broke&nbsp;out between Turkey and Russia in 1787 he was charged with the&nbsp;inspection of the troops at Craiova. Here he entered into close&nbsp;and friendly relations with a Turkish officer named Osman&nbsp;Passvan-Oglou (1758-1807), afterwards the famous governor&nbsp;of Widin, whose life he saved from the vengeance of Mavrogenes.&nbsp;After the death of his patron Rhigas returned to Bucharest to&nbsp;serve for some time as interpreter at the French Consulate. At&nbsp;this time he wrote the famous Greek version of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">well known in Byron’s paraphrase as “ sons of the Greeks,&nbsp;arise.” He was the founder of the Hetaireia, a society formcd&nbsp;to organize Greek patriotic sentiment and to provide the Greeks&nbsp;with arms and money. Believing that the influence of the&nbsp;French Revolution would spread to the Near East, he betook&nbsp;himself to Vienna to organize the movement among the exiled&nbsp;Greeks and their foreign supporters in 1793, or possibly earlier.&nbsp;He published in Vienna many Greek translations of foreign&nbsp;works, and presently founded a Greek press there, but his chief&nbsp;glory was the collection of national songs which, passed from&nbsp;hand to hand in MS., roused patriotic enthusiasm throughout&nbsp;Greece. They were only printed posthumously at Jassy in&nbsp;1814. While at Vienna Rhigas entered into communication&nbsp;with Bonaparte, to whom he sent a snuff-box made of the root&nbsp;of a laurel tree taken from the temple of Apollo, and eventually&nbsp;he set out with a view to meeting the general of the army of&nbsp;Italy in Venice. But before leaving Vienna he forwarded&nbsp;papers, amongst which is said to have been his correspondence</span></p>
