It has been ſaid, that the Ruffians think it beneath them to dance, and that they call in their Poliſh or Tartarian ſlaves to divert them with this exer-ciſe in their hours of diſſipation. Such may have been the caſe formerly, or may be ſo now, in the diſtant and moſt barbarous provinces oſ the empire ; but at St Peterſhurgh dancing is at preſent much reliſhed, and a minuet is nowhere ſo gracefully performed in Europe as by the faſhionable people in that metropolis.</p><p>We have elſewhere obſerved, that the Ruſſian language is a dialect of the Sclavonic, and the pureſt perhaps that is now anywhere to be found (ſee Philology, Sect. ix. § 3.) ; but they have nothing ancient written in it, except a tranſlation of Chryſoſtom’s Offices for Eaſter, which are at this day good Ruſſian, and intelligible to every boor, though certainly not leſs than 800 years old. There is no Ruſſian poetry which there is reaſon to believe 200 years old ; and the oldeſt tranſlation of the Scriptures into that language is but a late thing, and come to them from Koningſ-berg. Science has made but a very ſmall progreſs among them ; and the reputation of the imperial academy at St Peterſhurgh has been hitherto ſupported by the exertions ot foreigners. For antiquarian reſearch they have as little reliſh as for ſcientiſic inveſtigation. Every thing, to pleaſe, muſt be new ; and the only elucidations which we have of their antiquities are the performances of Germans and other foreigners, ſuch as profeſſors Bayer, Muller, and Gmelin. One native has indeed ſhown ſome deſire to recover and preſerve what he can of their moſt ancient poetry ; but in his reſearches, he ſeems more indebted to an exquiſitely nice ear than to any erudition. Erudition indeed they hold in the moſt ſovereign contempt. No gentleman is ever taught Latin or Greek ; and were a Ruſſian ſtranger in company to give any hint of his poſſeſſing ſuch knowledge, every man with a, ſword would draw away his chair, and let him down for a charity-boy. Peter the Great and the preſent empreſs have done what ſovereigns could do to diſpel theſe clouds of ignorance, by inſtituting ſchools and colleges, and giving the maſters and profeſſors military rank ; but all in vain. One oſ the moſt accompliſhed ſeſholars of the age, after having made himſelf extremely agreeable to a company of ladies, by means of his taſte in muſic, and a ſword at his ſide, was inſtantly deſerted by them upon ſome perſon’s whiſpering through the room that he was a man of learning ; and before his fair companions would be reconciled to him, he was obliged to pretend that he was a lieutenant colonel, totally illiterate.</p><p>The two ſirſt ſentences of Prince Shtcherbatoff’s dedication of his Hiſtory of Ruſſia, which was printed in three volumes 4<hi rend="sup">to</hi>, in 1770, afford an admirable ſpecimen of Ruſſian literature. “ The hiſtory of the human underſtanding (ſays this dedicator) aſſures us,that everywhere the ſciences have followed the progreſs of the proſperity and the ſtrength of kingdoms. When the Grecian arms had overthrown, the greateſt monarchy then in the world, when they had the famous generals Miltiades, Themiſtocles, Ariſtides, Conon, and Alcibiades, at the ſame time flouriſhed among them Anaximander, Anaxagoras, Archytas, Socrates, and Plato. And when Auguſtus had conquered the world, and had ſhut the gates of the temple of Janus,and the proud Romans, under his happy government, cheerfully obeyed his commands, then did Titus Livius, Thucydides, Virgil,and Horace, adorn his court, and celebrate his glory.”—A paſſage ſo replete as this with blunders and anachroniſms it would ſurely be difficult to find in any other author.</p><p>The Ruffians were converted to the Chriſtian religion towards the latter end of the tenth century, as has been already related. Since that period they have conſeſſed the articles of the Greek church, mingled with certain ſuperſtitious ceremonies of their own. They do not believe in the pope’s infallibility or ſupremacy, or even hold communion with the ſee of Rome : they uſe auricular conſeſſion, communicate in both kinds* adopt the Athanaſian creed, and adhere to the eſtabliſhed liturgy of St Baſil. They worſhip the Virgin Mary, and other ſaints ; and pay their adorations to croſſes and relics. They obſerve four great faſts in the year, during wſhich they neither taſte fiſh, fleſh, nor any animal production : they will not drink after a man who has eaten fleſh, nor uſe a knife that has cut meat in leſs than 24 hours aſter it has been uſed; nor will they, even though their health is at ſtake, touch any thing in which hartſhorn or any animal· ſubſtance has been infuſed. While this kind of Lent continues, they ſubſiſt upon cabbage, cucumbers, and rye-bread, drinking nothing ſtronger than a fort of ſmall beer called <hi rend="italic">quaffi-</hi>@@<hi rend="italic">.</hi>  They likewiſe faſt every Wedneſday and Friday. Their common penance is to abſtain from every ſpecies of food and drink, but bread, iβlt, cucumbers, and water. They are ordered to bend their bodies, and continue in that painful poſture, and between whiles to ſtrike their head againſt an image.</p><p>The Muſcovites at all times reject as impure; hotſe-fleſh, elk, veal, hare, rabbit, aſs’s milk, mare’s milk, and Venice-treacle, becauſe the fleſh of vipers is an ingredient ; alſo every thing that contains even the ſmalleſt quantity of muſk, civet, and caſtor : yet they have no averſion to ſwine’s fleſh ; on the contrary, the country produces excellent bacon. They celebrate 15 grand feſtivals in the year. On Palm-ſunday there is a magnificent proceſſion, at which the czar aſſiſts in perſon and on foot. He is apparelled in cloth of gold ; his train is borne up by the prime ot the nobility, and he is attended by his whole court. He is immediately preceded by the officers of his houſehold, one of whom carries his handkerchief on his arm, lying upon another of the richeſt embroidery. He halts at a fort of platform of free-ſtone, where, turning to the eaſt, and bending his body almoſt double, he pronounces a ſhort prayer : then he proceeds to the church of Jeruſalem, where he renews his devotion. This exerciſe being performed, he returns to his palace, the bridle of the patriarch’s horſe reſting upon his arm. The ho lie’s head being covered with white linen, is held by ſome nobleman ; while the patriarch, fitting ſide wiſe, and holding a croſs in his hand, diſtributes benedictions as he moves, along: on his head he Wears a cap edged with ermin, adorned with loops and buttons of gold <hi rend="sub">1</hi> and precious ſtones : before him are diſplayed banners of conſecrated ſtuff, in a variety of colours. Above 500 prieſts walk in the proceſſion ; thoſe who are near the patriarch bearing pictures oſ the Virgin Mary, richly ornamented with gold, jewels, and pearls, together with croſſes, relics, and religious books, including a copy of the Goſpels, which they reckon to be of in-</p><p>@@@See <hi rend="italic">Peaſant</hi></p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
