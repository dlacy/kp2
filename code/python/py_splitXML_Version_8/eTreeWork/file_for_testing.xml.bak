<p><label>RABIRIUS, GAIUS</label>
a Roman senator, who was defended (63 b.c.) by Cicero in a speech still extant. Nearly forty years after the death of L. Appuleius Saturninus, Titus Labienus (whose uncle had lost his life among the followers of Saturninus on that occasion) was put up by Caesar to accuse Rabirius of having been implicated in the murder. Caesar’s real object was to warn the Senate against interference by force with popular movements, to uphold the sovereignty of the people and the inviolability of the person of the tribunes. The obsolete accusation of pcrducllio was revived, and the case was heard before Julius and Lucius Caesar as commissioners specially appointed (1duoviri pcrducllionis). Rabirius was condemned, and the people, to whom the accused had exercised the right of appeal, were on the point of ratifying the decision, when A let ell us Celer pulled down the military flag from the Janiculum, which was equivalent to the dissolution of the assembly. Caesar’s object having been attained, the matter was then allowed to drop. </p> <p> A nephew, known as C. Rabirius Postumus, was also defended by Cicero (54 B.C.) in the extant speech Pro Rabirio Postumo, when charged with extortion in Egypt and complicity with Aulus Gabinius (?.t&gt;.). </p> <p> See Cicero, Pro Rabirio, ed. \V. E. Heitland (1882); Dio Cassius, xxxvii. 26-28; H. Putsche, Vber das genus judicii der Rede Ciceros pro C. Rabtrio (Jena, 1881); O. Schulthess, Der Process des C. Rabirius (Frauenfeld, 1891). </p> <anchor xml:id="caption1"/>  <head> <anchor xml:id="bookmark0"/> RACAN, HONORS DE BUEIL, MxRquiS DE (1589-1670), </head> <p> French poet, was born at the ch&amp;teau of La Roche-Racan in 15S9.

But in middle life he inherited some property, and he was thus able to devote himself to the practice of poetry, in which he was the faithful, and perhaps the most distinguished, disciple of Malherbe. He had known Malherbe when he was a page at the court of Henry IV., and had early contributed to the fashionable albums of the day. In 1625 he published his most important work, Bergeries, a dramatic pastoral in five acts, a part of which, entitled Arthenice, was played in 1618. Racan was also the author of Sept psaumes (1631), Odes sacrées tirées des psaumes de David (1651), Dernières œuvres et poésies chrétiennes (1660), in all of which be was hampered by his inability to read the sacred writings except in other French paraphrases. He was one of the original members of the French Academy. He died in February 1670. </p> <p> His Œuvres complètes were edited by Tenant de Latour in 1857, and the edition includes a biographical notice. See Sainte-Beuve, Causeries du lundi. </p>
