 uſually called <hi rend="italic">Porto Rico,</hi> one of the Weft India iſlands belonging to Spain, is ſituated in about 18. N. Lat. and between 65. 36. and 67. 45. W. Long, and is about 40 leagues long and 20 broad. The iſland is beautifully diverſifieded with woods, valleys, and plains, and is extremely fertile. It is well watered with ſprings and rivers, abounds with meadows, is divided by a ridge of mountains running from eaſt to weſt, and has a harbour ſo ſpacious that the largeſt ſhips may lie in it with ſafety. Before the arrival of the Spaniards it was inhabited by 4 or 500, 000 people, who, in a few years, were extirpated by its mercileſs conquerors. Raynal ſays, that its whole inhabitants amounts at preſent only to 1500 Spaniards, Meſtoes, and Mulattoes, and about 3000 negroes. Thus one of the fineſt iſlands in the Weſt Indies has been depopulated by the cruelty, and left uncultivated by the indolence, of its poſſeſſors. But it is the appointment of Providence, who ſeldom permits flagrant crimes to paſs unpuniſhed, that poverty and wretchedneſs ſhould be uniform conſequences of oppreſſion.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
