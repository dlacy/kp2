About the same time with Ma'nā’s translations began the Aristotelian studies of the Syrian Nestorians. To understand and translate the writings of their favourite Greek theologians, Paul of Samosata, Diodore of Tarsus, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Nestorius himself, not to mention Theodoret@@<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> of Cyrrhus, required a considerable knowledge of the Aristotelian logic. Hence the labours of Probus (<hi rend="italic">Πρόβςo</hi>, in Syriac <hi rend="italic">Pr</hi>ō<hi rend="italic">bhos, Prōbhā,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Prōbhē),</hi> who translated and commented on the ∏<hi rend="italic">ερί</hi> ἑ<hi rend="italic">μηvείaς,</hi>@@<hi rend="italic superscript">7</hi> and probably treated in a similar manner other parts of the <hi rend="italic">Organorι.</hi>@@<hi rend="italic">°</hi> It is not easy to fix his date precisely. 'Abhd-īshō'@@<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> makes him contemporary with Ibas and another translator named Kūmī. If the Berlin MS. Sachau 226 can be trusted, he was archdeacon and archiater at Antioch. Hoffmann@@<hi rend="superscript">10</hi> has assigned reasons for supposing him not to be anterior to the Athenian expositor Syrianus (433-450 ?).</p><p>Whilst the Nestorians were thus making rapid progress all over the East, another heresy was spreading in the West. Eutyches had found followers in Syria, among others Bar-saumā the archimandrite, a man famous for his piety and asceticism,@@<hi rend="superscript">11</hi> who represented the abbots of Syria at the second council of Ephesus,@@<hi rend="superscript">12</hi> and was afterwards condemned by the council of Chalcedon.@@<hi rend="superscript">13</hi> He died in 458.@@<hi rend="superscript">14</hi> His life was written by his disciple Samuel, in much the same style as that of Simeon Stylites, and is extant in several MSS. in the British Museum.@@<hi rend="superscript">15</hi> His memory has always been held in the greatest reverence by the Jacobites. The Armenians, according to Assemani,@@<hi rend="superscript">6</hi> keep his commemoration on the 1st of February, the Syrians and Copts on the 3d. The decisions of the council of Chalcedon produced an immediate and irreparable breach in the Eastern Church ; and the struggle of the rival factions was carried on with desperate fury alike at Constantinople, Antioch, and Alexandria. In Syria the persecution of the Monophysites was violent during the years 518-521, under the emperor Justin, and again in 535 and the following years, under Justinian, when they seemed in a fair way of being completely crushed by brute force.</p><p>The first name to be mentioned here, as belonging to both the 5th and 6th centuries, is that of Jacob of Sĕrūgh, one of the most celebrated writers of the Syrian Church,@@<hi rend="superscript">17</hi> “the flute of the Holy Spirit and the harp of the believing church.” There are no less than three biographies of him extant in Syriac,—the first, by his namesake Jacob of Edessa@@<hi rend="superscript">18</hi> ; the second, anonymous@@<hi rend="superscript">9</hi>; the third, a lengthy metrical panegyric, said to have been written for his commemoration@@<hi rend="superscript">20</hi> by a disciple of his named George.@@<hi rend="superscript">21</hi> This, however, seems, from the whole tone of the composition, to be unlikely, and Bickell is probably right in supposing the author to be George,</p><p>bishop of Sĕrūgh, a contemporary of Jacob of Edessa.@@<hi rend="superscript">22</hi> Jacob was born at Kurtam, “a village on the river Euphrates,” probably in the district of Sĕrūgh, in 451. His father was a priest, and, as his parents had been childless for many years, his birth was regarded as a reward for their alms, prayers, and vows. Whether he was educated at Edessa or not, he soon acquired a great reputation for learning and eloquence. He appears to have led a life of quiet work and study, and to have devoted himself in particular to literary composition. He became periodeutes of Ḥaurā in Sĕrūgh, whence we find him writing to the Christians of Najrān, and to the city of Edessa when threatened by the Persians.@@<hi rend="superscript">23</hi> As periodeutes he is mentioned in eulogistic terms by Joshua the Stylite@@<hi rend="superscript">24 </hi>(503). In 519, when sixty-eight years old, he was made bishop of Batman, the chief town of Sĕrūgh, where he died on 29th November 521. Jacob’s prose writings are not numerous.@@<hi rend="superscript">25</hi> A liturgy is ascribed to him, and an order of baptism, the former of which has been translated by Renaudot,@@<hi rend="superscript">26</hi> the latter edited by J. A. Assemani.@@<hi rend="superscript">27 </hi>Further, he composed six festal homilies, one of which has been published by Zingerle,@@<hi rend="superscript">28</hi> who has also translated the whole of them into German@@<hi rend="superscript">29</hi> ; a discourse showing that we should not neglect or despise our sins@@<hi rend="superscript">30</hi>; another for the night of Wednesday in the third week of Lent@@<hi rend="superscript">31</hi> ; and some short funeral sermons.@@<hi rend="superscript">32</hi> To him we also owe a life of Mār Hannīnā (died in 500), addressed to one Philotheus.@@<hi rend="superscript">33</hi> Of his letters a considerable number have been preserved, particularly in two MSS. in the British Museum, Add. 14587 and 17163, ff. l-48.@@<hi rend="superscript">34</hi> Of these Martin has edited and translated the three epistles to the monks of the convent of Mār Bassus at Ḥārim,@@<hi rend="superscript">35</hi> with a reply by the monks, and another letter to Paul, bishop of Edessa, from all of which it is evident that Jacob always was a Monophysite, and continued such to his death.@@<hi rend="superscript">36 </hi>The letter to Stephen bar Ṣūdh-ailē is given, with an English version, by Frothingham@@<hi rend="superscript">37</hi>; and that to the Himyarite Christians of Najrān has been edited and translated by Schröter in the <hi rend="italic">Z.D.M.G., </hi>xxxi. (1877), p. 360 <hi rend="italic">sg.</hi> It belongs to the year 519 or 520.@@<hi rend="superscript">38</hi> According to Bar-Hebræus,@@<hi rend="superscript">9</hi> he also wrote “a commentary on the six centuries of Evagrius, at the request of Mär George, bishop of the (Arab) tribes, who was his disciple.” As George, bishop of the Arab tribes, was a contemporary of Jacob of Edessa, this statement seems to rest on some misapprehension ; at all events no such work now exists. The paucity of Jacob’s prose writings is more than compensated by a flood of metrical compositions, mostly in dodecasyllabic verse, or the four-syllable line thrice repeated. “He had,” says Bar-Hebræus,@@<hi rend="superscript">40</hi> “seventy amanuenses to copy out his metrical homilies, which were 760@@<hi rend="superscript">41</hi> in number, besides commentaries and letters and odes (<hi rend="italic">madhrāshē)</hi> and hymns (<hi rend="italic">sughyāthā)</hi> Of these homilies more than the half have perished, but nearly 300 are still preserved in European collections.@@<hi rend="superscript">42</hi> Very few of them have as yet been published, though many of them are by no means devoid of interest.@@<hi rend="superscript">43</hi> Indeed Jacob is on the whole far more readable than Ephraim or Isaac of Antioch.</p><p>Very different from the gentle and studious bishop of Sĕrūgh was his contemporary and neighbour, the energetic and fiery Philoxenus of Mabbōgh.
