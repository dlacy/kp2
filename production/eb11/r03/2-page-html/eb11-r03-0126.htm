            <p><span class="font2">Among the State Papers of 1625 is a &quot; Discourse on what

            <p><span class="font2">This costume is illustrated in Hollar’s engraving of the
                    coronation procession of Charles II. Towards the end of the 17th
                    century&nbsp;the judges took to wearing wigs, and have continued to wear
                    them&nbsp;ever since. The wearing of wigs naturally concealed the coif
                    and&nbsp;velvet skull-cap, so a device had to be invented by which
                    they&nbsp;could still be displayed. The expedient was hit upon of putting&nbsp;a
                    round patch of white stuff, with a black spot in the middle of it,&nbsp;on the
                    crown of the wig of certain of the judges, to represent the&nbsp;coif and
                    skull-cap. The rank of serjeant no longer existing, this&nbsp;round patch has
