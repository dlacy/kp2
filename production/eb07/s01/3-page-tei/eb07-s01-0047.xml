They are praised by Captain King for their mild and affectionate dispositions; yet it is difficult to reconcile such dispositions with the habits of savage life, which are always ferocious and cruel. Humanity, mildness, and all the gentler sympathies of the human heart, are fostered by civilization. They are the result of cultivation, and not the spontaneous produce of the human heart ; and, accordingly, they come to no maturity in the adverse soil of barbarism. Besides, they are inferior to the other islanders in that sure test of humanity, namely, respect for women. It has even been suspected, though no positive evidence of the fact has been found, that they are or have been in the practice of eating the bodies of their enemies ; and it is well known, that the sacrificing of human victims was commonly practised among them, which is certainly no index of any mildness in their manners ; and the same ferocious spirit is indicated by their wearing, as ornaments the most precious and invaluable, which are handed down as a sort of heir-looms in families, the bones of their enemies slain in battle, which are fashioned into various forms. Their natural capacity when they were first visited by Europeans was found to be good ; they had made some improvements in agriculture and manufactures ; and the eager curiosity with which they attended the armourer’s forge, and the many expedients they invented for working the iron procured from Europeans, afforded strong proofs of their docility and their ingenuity. They had, however, all the peculiar customs of the most savage nations, and are still in the practice, along with all the other inhabitants of these islands, notwithstanding the example and exhortations of the missionaries settled among them, of ta- tooing their bodies, and also their face, which is peculiar to them and to the New Zealanders. The common dress of all ranks of people consists only of a piece of thick cloth ten or twelve inches broad, which they pass between the legs and tie round the waist. They have another dress appropriated to ceremonial occasions, which consists of a feathered cloak and helmet, and which is remarkable for its beauty and magnificence, and is reserved chiefly for persons of high rank. The common people chiefly subsist on fish and vegetables, such as yams, sweet potatoes, ta- mow, plantains, sugar-canes, and bread. To these the people of a higher rank add the flesh of hogs and dogs, dressed in the same manner as at the Society Islands. They also eat fowls.

In the vicinity is an extensive lake. Sandy is twenty-five miles south-east from Furruckabad. Long. 70. 58. E. Lat. 27. 18. N.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sandy Desert,</hi> an extensive tract in Hindustan, so named in the maps, bounded on the south by the province of Cutch, on the east by that of Gujerat, on the west by Sinde, and on the north by Ajmecr. This region is but little known to Europeans ; but, from the accounts of those by whom it has been traversed, it does not appear to be such a uniform and barren wilderness as it has been represented, being interspersed with many fertile spots, the seats of petty chiefships or stationary tribes. The most powerful of these chiefs are the Beloochee Kosahs, who settled in the country a good many years ago, and are a race of sanguinary thieves, who infest the district of Parkur, and extend their ravages to the Joudpour territories. They amount to about 12,000. They disown all allegiance to any superior, subsisting by their horses and their swords, and hiring out their services to the different predatory chieftains. The only produce of this tract is a coarse species of grain, which only grows where the sandy soil is a little mixed with clay. Wa</p><p>termelons grow abundantly and in great perfection throughout the whole of this parched region, and furnish a most grateful refreshment. The river Loonee, which comes from Marwar, runs through the Gurrah district, and is said to fall into the Run, which bounds Cutch to the north. The route across this tract of country from Rahdunpore is fifty coss, and is said to be good the whole way. Thirty coss west from Pareenuggur is situated Islamnaggur. The intervening country consists of sand-hills, in traversing which the traveller is exposed to great hardship from the heat, the glare, and the want of water. All over this sandy tract are to be found scattered jungle, and coarse vegetation of different sorts, which supply the cattle with food. Islamnaggur is described as a strong fort, situated in the desert, and destitute of water without the walls. The country north from Parkur, towards Amercote, is called Dhat, and the distance is eighty coss. The country is of the same character as that already described, being composed of sand-hills and jungle, with occasional wells. In many parts there is no cultivation, and the inhabitants subsist on the produce of their numerous flocks of cattle, and camels. The natives are described as pacifically inclined, possessing few horses, and armed with swords only. It was in this tract that the array of the celebrated Mahmoud of Ghizni was nearly lost.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sandy Island,</hi> a small island near the west coast of Sumatra. Long. 100. 18. E.

In 1581 he was collated to a prebend in the cathedral of York. He travelled into foreign countries ; and, upon his return, became famous for learning, prudence, and virtue. While he was at Paris, he drew up a tract, published under the title of <hi rend="italic">Europa Speculum.</hi> In 1602, he resigned his prebend ; and the year following he was knighted by King James I., who employed him in several important affairs. He was dexterous in any great employment, and a good friend and patriot. Opposing the court, however, with vigour in the parliament in 1621, he, with Mr Selden, was committed to custody for a month. He died in 1629, having bequeathed L.1500 to the university of Oxford, for the endowment of a metaphysical lecture.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sandys, </hi><hi rend="italic">George,</hi> brother of Sir Edwin, and youngest son of Archbishop Sandys, was born in 1577. He was a very accomplished man, travelled over several parts of Europe and the East, and published a relation of his journey in folio in 1615. He made an elegant translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses ; and composed some poetical pieces of his own, which were greatly admired at the time in which they were written. He also paraphrased the Psalms ; and has left behind him a translation, with notes, of one Sacred Drama, written originally by Grotius, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Christus Patiens,</hi> on which, with <hi rend="italic">Adamus Exul,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Masenius,</hi> is founded Lauder’s impudent charge of plagiarism against Milton. Our author became one of the privy chamber to Charles I., and died in 1643.</p><p>SANGA, a regularly-built seaport of Japan, in the island of Ximo, with wide streets, and defended by a citadel.
