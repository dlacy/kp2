The Emperor even prohibited all affem-blages of emigrants within his ſtates ; and the King intimated to the Aſſembly that he had declared to the&nbsp;Elector of Treves, that unleſs the emigrants ſhould&nbsp;ceaſe before tbe 15th of January to make hoſtile preparations within his territories, he would be conſidered as&nbsp;the enemy of France. All this, however, did not preſerve the court from ſuſpicion ; for although the diffe-rent foreign courts had openly declared pacific inten-tions, yet the French emigrants boldly aſſerted, that all&nbsp;Europe was actually arming in their favour. Accordingly they ceaſed not to ſolicit their equals in rank,&nbsp;wlio ſtill remained within tlie country, to leave it to&nbsp;îoin witli tliem in what tliey called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">royal cauſe.—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The unhappy Louis, placed between a republican&nbsp;party that was gradually gathering ſtrengtli, and an&nbsp;ariſtocratical party that was rouſing Europe to arms&nbsp;againſt a nation of wliich he was the conſtitutional&nbsp;chief, and a combination of Princes juſtly ſuſpected of&nbsp;wiſhing to ſeize upon a part of his dominions, ſtood in&nbsp;.a ſituation which would have perplexed tlie moſt ſkilful&nbsp;ſtateſman ; and it is no proof of incapacity that he ſell&nbsp;a ſacrifice to circumſtances which miglit have overwhelmed any known meaſure of human ingenuity. Addreffes were crowding into the Aſſembly, diſapproving&nbsp;the conduct of the court. M. Montmorin reſigned ;&nbsp;M. Deleſſart ſucceeded him ; and M. Caluer de Ger-villc became miniſter of the interior. M. du Portail&nbsp;reſigned alfo, and M. Narbonne ſucceeded him as ml-niſter of war. In the month of November, M. Bailly’s&nbsp;mayoralty terminated ; and the once popular La Fayette&nbsp;appeared as a candidate to ſucceed him. But he was&nbsp;ſucceſsfully oppoſed by M. Petion, a violent Jacobin,&nbsp;and a declared republican, who was elected mayor of&nbsp;Paris by a great majority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this period the moderate men, who were friends of the conſtitution, attempted to counteract the influence of the Jacobin club by the eſtabliſhment of a ſi-milar one. It derived its name from the vacant convent of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Feudlans,</span><span class="font0"> 111 whlch lt affembled. ſt he moſt&nbsp;active members of the Conſtituent Affembly belonged&nbsp;to it, ſuch as Μ. M. D’ Andre, Barnave, the Lametbs,&nbsp;Du Port, Rabaud, Sieyes, Chapelier, Thouret, La-bord, Taleyrand, Montefquieu, Beaumetz, &amp;c. The&nbsp;Jacobins contrived to excite a riot at the place of their&nbsp;meeting, which was in the vicinity of the hall of the&nbsp;National Aſſembly. This afforded a pretext for ap-plying to the Affembly for tbe removal of the new clilb.&nbsp;The A ſſembly ſhowed their diſpoſition, by complying&nbsp;with this requeftt</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At the end of this year, the kingdom of France was by no means proſperous. The public revenue had&nbsp;fallen far ſhort of the expenditure. The emigrant no-bility had carried out of the kingdom tbe greater part&nbsp;of the current coin, and a variety of manufacturers,&nbsp;who depended upon their oftentatious luxury, were re-duced to much diſtrefs. The diſpoſitions of foreign&nbsp;courts appeared very doubtful. The new year, how-ever, opened with deluſive proſpects of tranquillity.—&nbsp;The German Princes appeared ſatisfied with the mode&nbsp;of compenfation whieh the French had offered for the&nbsp;loſs of their poffeffions in Alſace and Lorraine. The&nbsp;Prince of Loweſtein accepted of an indemnification.—&nbsp;The Princes of Hohenlohe and Salm-Salm declared&nbsp;themſelves ready to treat upon the ſame terms. Prince</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">Maximilian, and tlie Dukes of wirtemberg and Deux-Ponts, freely ncgociated. It is unneceffary to ftate in detail the ſubterfuges employed, in the mean time, by&nbsp;the crafty Leopold, for amuſing the French with the&nbsp;appearances of peace. M. Deleſſart, miniſter for fo-reign affairs, fell a ſacriſice to them, and probably to&nbsp;the undecided character of Louis. He was accufed&nbsp;by M. Briffot of not having given timely notice to the&nbsp;National Aſſembly of the diſpoſitions of foreign powers,&nbsp;and of not preffing proper meaſures for ſecuring the ho-nour and ſafety of the nation. A decree of accuſation&nbsp;paffed againſt him in his ab fence. He was apprehend-ed, tried by the high national court at Orleans, and&nbsp;executed in conſequence of its ſentence. '</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſudden death of Leopold on the ſirſt of March gave riſe to a tranſient hope that peace might ſtill be&nbsp;preſerved. A ſuſpicion of poiſon ſell upon the French,&nbsp;but it was removed by the detail of his diſeaſe that was&nbsp;ſpeedily piibliſhed. On the 16th of the fame month,&nbsp;the King of Sweden was wounded by a nobleman of&nbsp;the name of Ankerſtrom, ftnd died on the 29th. This&nbsp;enterpriſing Prince had overturned the conſtitution of&nbsp;his own conntry, and he had formed the project of con-ducting in perſon his troops to the frontiers of France,&nbsp;and of commanding or accompanying the combined ar-mies of Europe in their attempt to avenge the cauſe of&nbsp;inſulted royalty. It was in a great meaſure to counter-act this ſeheme that he was aſſaffinated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſudden fall, however, of thefe two enemies rather accelerated than retarded the meditated hoſtilities. The young King of Hungary, who ſucceeded to the&nbsp;empire, made no ſecret either of his own intentions or&nbsp;of the exiſtence of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">concert of Princes</span><span class="font0"> againſt France.&nbsp;M. Dumourier was now at the head of the war-office,&nbsp;M. Rolland was miniſter of the interior, and M. Cla-viere miniſter of finance. The Jacobins were all-powerful. The Court gave way to the torrent. The property of the emigrants was conſiſeated, reſerving the&nbsp;rights of creditors. The Imperial miniſter, Prince&nbsp;Kaunitz, demanded three things of France; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lſt,</span><span class="font0"> Tile&nbsp;reſtitution of their feudal rights to the German Princes;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zdly,</span><span class="font0"> To reſtore Avignon to the Pope, the inhabitants&nbsp;of which had fome time before thrown off their allegiance, and prevailed with the Conſtituent Affembly to&nbsp;receive their country as a part of France ; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">laſtly,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Prince Kaunitz demanded, that &quot; the neighbouring&nbsp;powers ſhould have no reaſon for apprehenſion from the&nbsp;preſent weakneſs of the internal government of France.”&nbsp;On receiving thefe demands, the king propoſed a decla-ration of war, which was decreed by the National Aſe&nbsp;ſembly on the 20th of April, againſt </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the King oſ Hungary and Bohemia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The French immediately began the war, by attack-ing in three different columns the Auſtrian Netherlands. M. Theobald Dillon advanced from Liile to Tournay,&nbsp;where he found a ſtrong body of Auſtrians ready to receive him. The national troops, unaccuſtomed to ſuſtain the ſire of regular ſoldiers, were inſtantly thrown&nbsp;into confuſion, and fled even to the gates of Liſie. The&nbsp;cry of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">treaſon</span><span class="font0"> refounded on all ſides; and their com.&nbsp;mander, an experienced and faithful officer, was murdered by bis own ſoldiers and the mob.
