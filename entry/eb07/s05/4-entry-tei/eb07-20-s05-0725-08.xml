It was customary to stigmatize the worshippers and votaries of some of the gods. The marks used on these occasions were various ; sometimes they contained the name of the god, sometimes his particular ensign, as the thunderbolt of Jupiter, the trident of Neptune, the ivy of Bacchus ; or they marked themselves with some mystical number, by which the godâ€™s name was described.

Theodoret is of opinion that the Jews were forbidden to brand themselves with stigmata, because the idolaters, by that ceremony, used to consecrate themselves to their false gods.
