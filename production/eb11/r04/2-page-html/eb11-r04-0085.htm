It may date from the 2nd century </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">B.c. </span><span class="font2">The neighbouring Ionic temple, popularly called of Fortuna Virilis, is of special interest from its early date, probably the end of the 3rd century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The complete absence of marble and the very sparing use </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font2"> travertine, combined with the simple purity of its design, indicate an&nbsp;early date.<sup>@@1</sup> It has a prostyle tetrastyle portico of travertine, and&nbsp;a short cella of tufa with engaged columns; the bases of these and&nbsp;of the angle columns are of travertine. The frieze has reliefs of&nbsp;ox skulls and garlands. The whole was originally stuccoed and&nbsp;painted so that the different stones used would not show. Fig. 12&nbsp;gives the plan, showing the hard travertine used at the points of&nbsp;greatest pressure, while the main walls with the half columns are&nbsp;of the weaker and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I softer tufa. The dedication of this&nbsp;temple is doubtful;&nbsp;but it is probably&nbsp;either that of Fortuna or of Mater&nbsp;Matuta, both of&nbsp;which were destroyed by fire in&nbsp;213 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> and restored in the following year. The&nbsp;church of S. Maria&nbsp;in Cosmedin contains some remains of a temple (Plan, No. 4)&nbsp;which has been identified with that of Hercules built by Pompey&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ad Circum Maximum</span><span class="font2"> (Vitr. iii. 2, 5; Plin. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.N.</span><span class="font2"> xxxiv. 57).&nbsp;The temple stands close to the carccres of the Circus . Maximus, in the Forum Boarium. The columns built up in the&nbsp;church did not, however, belong to a temple, but to a porticus.&nbsp;Within the walls of S. Niccolo in Carcere in the Forum Holitorium&nbsp;(Plan, No. 18) are preserved remains of three small hexastyle&nbsp;peripteral temples, two Ionic and one Tuscan, set close side&nbsp;by side.<sup>@@2</sup> A fragment of the marble plan includes part of this&nbsp;group. The Tuscan temple is built of travertine, the others&nbsp;of tufa and peperino,. with travertine at the points of greatest&nbsp;pressure. They are probably those of Janus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ad Theatrum Marcelli,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">dedicated by C. Duilius in the First Punic War (Tac. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.</span><span class="font2"> ii. 49);&nbsp;of Spes, built by A. Atilius Calatinus, of about the same date (Tac.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.</span><span class="font2"> ii. 49); and of Juno Sospita, dedicated by C. Cornelius&nbsp;Cethegus in 197 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> (Liv. xxxiv. 53). Near the Forum Holitorium&nbsp;ate extensive remains of the large group of buildings included in the&nbsp;Porticus Octaviae (Plan, No. 16), two of which, dedicated to Juno&nbsp;Regina and Jupiter Stator, with part o<sup>f</sup> the enclosing porticus and&nbsp;the adjoining temple of Hercules Musarum, are shown on a fragment&nbsp;of the marble plan. The Porticus Octaviae, a large&nbsp;rectangular space enclosed by a double line of columns,&nbsp;was built in honour of Octavia by her brother Augustus&nbsp;on the site of the Porticus Metelli, founded in.146 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> This must&nbsp;not be confounded with the neighbouring Porticus Octavia founded&nbsp;by Cn. Octavius, the conqueror of Perseus (Liv. xlv. 6, 42), in&nbsp;168 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C., </span><span class="font2">and rebuilt under the same name by Augustus, as is recorded in the Ancyran inscription. The whole group was one of&nbsp;the most magnificent in Rome, and contained a large number of&nbsp;works of art by Pheidias and other Greek sculptors. The existing&nbsp;portico, which was the main entrance into the porticus, is a restoration of the time of Severus in 203. The church of S. Angelo in&nbsp;Peschcria and the houses behind it conceal extensive remains of the&nbsp;porticus and its temples (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.

<p><span class="font2">Remains of a large peripteral Corinthian temple are built into</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the side of the Borsa (formerly the Custom House). Eleven marble columns and their rich entablature are still </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;situ,</span><span class="font2"> with the corresponding part of the cella wall of&nbsp;peperino; in 1878 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">piece of the end wall of the cella&nbsp;was discovered, and, under the houses near, part of a large peribolus wall, also of peperino, forming an enclosure with columns&nbsp;all round the temple nearly 330 ft. square (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bull. Comm. Arch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rom.</span><span class="font2"> vi. pi. iv., 1878). This temple has commonly been identified with that cf Neptune (Dio Cass. lxvi. 24), built by Agrippa, and&nbsp;surrounded by the Porticus Argonautarum (Dio Cass. liii. 27;&nbsp;Mart. iii. 20, 11); but it clearly dates, at least in its present form,&nbsp;from the 2nd century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.,</span><span class="font2"> and is not improbably the temple of&nbsp;Hadrian, mentioned in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia</span><span class="font2"> as being near this spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The temple of Venus and Rome on the Velia (see fig. 8) was the largest in Rome; it was pseudo-dipteral, with ten Corinthian columns of Greek marble at the ends, and probably twenty at the sides; it had an outer colonnade&nbsp;round the peribolus of about 180 columns of polished&nbsp;granite. Of these only a few fragments now exist; for several centuries</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">the whole area of this building was used as a quariy, while the residue of the marble was burnt into lime on the spot in kilns built&nbsp;of broken fragments of the porphyry columns. A considerable part&nbsp;of the two cellae with their apses, set back to back, still exists; in&nbsp;each apse was a colossal seated figure of the deity, and along the&nbsp;side walls of the cellae were rows of porphyry columns and statues&nbsp;in niches. The vault is deeply coffered with stucco enrichments&nbsp;once painted and gilt. The roof was covered w’ith tiles of gilt&nbsp;bronze, which were taken by Pope Honorius I. (625-38) to cover the&nbsp;basilica of St Peter’s., These were stolen by the Saracens during&nbsp;their sack of the Leonine city in 846. The emperor Hadrian himself&nbsp;designed this magnificent, temple, which was partially completed&nbsp;in 135; the design was criticized severely by the architect Apollo-dorus (Dio .Cass. lxix. 4; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vita lladr.</span><span class="font2"> 19). The temple was&nbsp;probably finished by Antoninus Pius; it was partly burned in&nbsp;the reign of Maxentius, who began its restoration, which was&nbsp;carried on by Constantine. The existing remains of the two cellae&nbsp;are mainly of Hadrian’s time, but contain patches of the later&nbsp;restorations. Between the south angle of this temple and the arch&nbsp;of Constantine stand the remains of a fountain, usually known as the&nbsp;Meta Sudans. This was a tall conical structure in a large circular&nbsp;basin, all lined with marble. From its brick facing it appears to be&nbsp;a work of the Flavian period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That part of the Caelian hill which is near the Colosseum is covered with very extensive remains—a great peribolus of brickfaced. concrete, apparently of Flavian date, and part of a&nbsp;massive travertine arcade in two storeys, similar to that&nbsp;of the Colosseum; most of the latter has been removed&nbsp;for the sake of the stone, but a portion still exists under&nbsp;the monastery and campanile of SS. Giovanni e Paolo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There can be no reasonable doubt that these substructures carried the temple of Claudius, built by Vespasian (Suet. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vesp.</span><span class="font2"> 9).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The so-called temple of Minerva Medica (“ Nympheum ” on Plan) on the eastern slope of the Esquiline (so named ftom a statue found&nbsp;in it), a curiously planned budding, with central decagonal domed&nbsp;hall, probably belonged to the palace of Gallienus (263-68). Somewhat similar ruins beside the neighbouring basilica of S. Croce&nbsp;formed part of the Sessorium, a palace on the Esquiline. The&nbsp;remains on the Quirinal, in the Colonna gardens, of massive marble&nbsp;entablatures richly sculptured were formerly thought to belong to&nbsp;Aurelian's great temple of the Sun, but it now appears certain that&nbsp;they belong to the very extensive thermae of Constantine, part of&nbsp;the site of which is now occupied by the Quirinal palace and neighbouring buildings.<sup>@@4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The excavations of recent years have brought to light, and in many cases destroyed, a large number of domestic, buildings;&nbsp;these discoveries are recorded in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Notizie degli Scavi&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bull. Comm. Arch. Rom.</span><span class="font2"> The extensive cutting&nbsp;away of the Tiber bank for the new embankment exposed&nbsp;some very ornate houses near the Villa Farnesina, richly decorated&nbsp;with marble, fine wall-paintings, and stucco reliefs, equal in beauty&nbsp;to any works of the kind that have ever been found. These are now&nbsp;exhibited in the Museo delie Terme, but the houses themselves have&nbsp;been destroyed. The laying out of the new Quirinal and Esquiline&nbsp;quarters has also exposed many fine buildings. Some remains on&nbsp;the Esquiline have been supposed (without much probability) to&nbsp;belong to the villa of Maecenas. A very remarkable vaulted room,&nbsp;decorated with paintings of plants and landscapes, has been shown&nbsp;to be a greenhouse;<sup>@@5</sup> at one end is an apse with a series of step-like&nbsp;stages for flowers. This one room has been preserved, though the&nbsp;rest of the villa has been destroyed; it is on the road leading from&nbsp;S. Maria Maggiore to the Lateran. The walls are a very fine specimen of tufa </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticulatum,</span><span class="font2"> unmixed with brick, evidently of the&nbsp;early imperial period. Among the numerous buildings discovered&nbsp;in the Horti Sallustiani near the Quirinal was a very fine house of&nbsp;the 1st century </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">A.D., </span><span class="font2">in concrete faced with brick and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">opus reticu-latum.</span><span class="font2"> It had a central circular domed hall, with many rooms and&nbsp;staircases round it, rising four storeys high. This house was set in&nbsp;the valley against a cliff of the Quirinal, so that the third floor is&nbsp;level with the upper part of the hill. It is nearly on the line of the&nbsp;Servian wall, which stood here at a higher level on the edge of the&nbsp;cliff. This park was laid out by the historian Sallust, and remained&nbsp;in the possession of his family until the reign of Tiberius, when it&nbsp;became imperial property; it was used as a residence by Nero&nbsp;(Tac. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.</span><span class="font2"> xiii. 47) and other emperors till the 4th century.<sup>@@6</sup> In&nbsp;1884, near the Porta S.
