<p><span class="font0">root bearing at the apex a stem bud. As in the case of the stem, growth in length occurs only for a short distance behind the apex,&nbsp;but in long-lived roots increase in diameter&nbsp;occurs continually in a similar manner to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">growth in thickness in the stem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roots are usually underground and colour</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">less, but in some cases where they arise from the stem they pass for some distance through&nbsp;the air before reaching the soil. Such, roots&nbsp;are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aerial.</span><span class="font0"> They are well seen in the&nbsp;screw-pine </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pandanus), </span><span class="font0">the Banyan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ficus&nbsp;indica,</span><span class="font0"> fig. 7), and many, other species of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ficus, </span><span class="font0">where they assist in supporting the&nbsp;stem and branches.. In the mangrove they&nbsp;often form the entire, support of the stem,&nbsp;which has decayed at its lower part. In tree-ferns they form a dense coating around, and&nbsp;completely concealing, the stem; such is&nbsp;also the case in some Dracaenas and palms.&nbsp;In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epiphytes,</span><span class="font0"> or plants growing in the air,&nbsp;attached to the trunks of trees,»such as orchids&nbsp;of warm climates, the aerial roots produced&nbsp;do not reach the soil; they continue always&nbsp;aerial and greenish, and they possess stomata.&nbsp;Delicate hairs are often seen on these epiphytal roots, as well as a peculiar spongy&nbsp;investment formed by the cells of the epidermis which have lost their succulent contents and are now filled with air. This layer is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">velamen,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and serves to condense the moisture contained in the air, on which</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the plant is dependent for its water-supply. The aerial roots of the ivy are not. the nutritive roots of the plant, but are only intended&nbsp;for mechanical support. The climbing roots of many orchids, aroids&nbsp;and epiphytic ferns branch and form places of lodgment for humus&nbsp;into which absorbent branches of the climbing roots penetrate.&nbsp;Some leafless epiphytic orchids, such as species of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Angraecum,</span><span class="font0"> depend&nbsp;entirely upon their aerial roots for nourishment; the roots, which&nbsp;are green, perform the functions both of leaves and roots. A&nbsp;respiratory or aerating function is performed by roots of certain&nbsp;mangroves growing, in swampy soil or water and sending vertical&nbsp;roots up into the air which are provided with aerating passages by&nbsp;which the root system below can communicate with true outside air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Parasitic plants, as the mistletoe (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vi scum),</span><span class="font0"> broom-rape </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Orobanche) </span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rafflesia,</span><span class="font0"> send root-like processes into the substance of the plants&nbsp;whence they derive nourishment. In the dodder </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Cuscuta),</span><span class="font0"> the tissue&nbsp;around the root swells into a kind of sucker (haustorium), which is&nbsp;applied flat upon the other plant, and ultimately becomes concave,&nbsp;so as to attach the plant by a vacuum. From the bottom of the&nbsp;sucker the root protrudes, and penetrates the tissue of the host&nbsp;plant. Leaf-buds are sometimes formed on roots, as in plum,&nbsp;cherry and other fruit trees; the common elm affords an excellent&nbsp;example, the.young shoots which grow up in the neighbourhood&nbsp;of a tree arising from the roots beneath the soil. In some plants&nbsp;no roots are formed at all; thus in the orchid </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Corallorhiza,</span><span class="font0"> known&nbsp;as coral-root, a stem-structure, the shortly branched underground&nbsp;rhizome,.performs all the functions of a true root which is absent.&nbsp;In aquatic plants the root acts merely as a holdfast or is altogether&nbsp;absent as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Salvinia, Utricularia</span><span class="font0"> and others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROPE and ROPE-MAKING. All varieties of cordage having a circumference of an inch or more are known by the general&nbsp;name of “ rope.” Twisted cordages of smaller dimensions are&nbsp;called cords, twines and lines, and when the sectional area&nbsp;is still smaller, the article is known as thread or doubled yarn.&nbsp;All these varieties of cordage are composed of a number of&nbsp;separate yarns, each of which is made from some kind of textile&nbsp;fibre by preparing and spinning machinery. The number of&nbsp;separate yarns which ultimately form the rope or cord depends&nbsp;upon the fineness of the yam, and also upon the circumference&nbsp;of the finished article. From thread and fine twine upwards&nbsp;the whole art of manufacture is that of twisting together fibres&nbsp;and yams; but the comparative heaviness and coarseness of&nbsp;the materials operated on in rope-making render necessary&nbsp;the adoption of heavy machinery and modified processes which&nbsp;clearly define this manufacture as a distinct calh’ng. The&nbsp;modem trade of rope-making is again divided into two distinct&nbsp;branches dealing with vegetable fibres and metallic wire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many different vegetable fibres are used for rope-making, but for the combined qualities of strength, flexibility and&nbsp;durability, none can compete yvith the common hemp, which&nbsp;is consequently the staple of the rope-maker. Cotton ropes&nbsp;are, however, much more flexible, and in addition are strong&nbsp;and durable; they are, therefore, much preferred for power&nbsp;transmission in textile and other works. Manila hemp is a&nbsp;fibre of remarkable tenacity, of unapproached value for heavy&nbsp;cordage, but too stiff for small cords and twines. After these&nbsp;in utility come Sisal hemp of Central America </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Agava Sisalana),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Phormium hemp of New Zealand </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Phormium tenax}</span><span class="font0"> and Sunn&nbsp;hemp of the East Indies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Crotalaria juncea)—</span><span class="font0">all fibres of great&nbsp;strength, and largely used by rope-makers. Jute </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;India </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Corchorus capsularis</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. olitorus)</span><span class="font0"> is now largely&nbsp;used by rope-makers on account of its cheapness. When used&nbsp;alone it is deficient in strength and durability, but when used&nbsp;in conjunction with proper proportions of hemp it makes a&nbsp;very satisfactory and useful rope. Among fibres more rarely&nbsp;seen in rope-works are Jubbulpore hemp </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Crotalaria tenuifolia),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">boxstring hemp </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Sanseviera zeylanica),</span><span class="font0"> and other hemps of the&nbsp;East Indies, plantain fibre </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Musa paradisica),</span><span class="font0"> and agave fibre&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Agave americana)</span><span class="font0"> of America. Coir and many other fibres&nbsp;are used, but principally in the locab’ties of their production.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A rope is composed of a certain number of <sup>a</sup> strands,” the strand itself being made up of a number of single threads or&nbsp;yarns. Three strands laid or twisted together form a “ hawser-laid ” rope, and three | such hawsers similarly laid make a&nbsp;“ cable-laid ” rope or “ cable.” A “ shroud-laid ” rope usually&nbsp;consists of four strands laid around a central strand or core.&nbsp;The prepared fibre is twisted or spun to the right hand to form&nbsp;yarn; the required numher of yams receive a left-hand twist&nbsp;to make a strand; three strands twisted to the right make&nbsp;a hawser; and three hawsers twisted to the left form a cable.&nbsp;Thus the twist in each operation is in a different direction&nbsp;from that of the preceding one, and this alternation of direction&nbsp;serves, to some extent, to preserve the parallelism of the fibres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The primary object of twisting fibres together in a rope is that by mutual friction they may [be held together when a&nbsp;strain is applied to the whole. Hard twisting has the further&nbsp;advantage of compacting the fibres and preventing, to some&nbsp;extent, the penetration of moisture when the ropes are exposed&nbsp;to water; but the yield of rope from a given length of yam&nbsp;diminishes in proportion to the increase of twist. The proper&nbsp;degree of twist given to ropes is generally such that the rope is&nbsp;from three-fourths to two-thirds the length of yarn composing it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rope-walk Spinning.</span><span class="font0">—The sequence of operations in this method of working is as follows: (i) hackling the fibre;&nbsp;(2) spinning the yarn; (3) tarring the yam when necessary;&nbsp;(4) forming the strands; (5) laying the strands into ropes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hackling differs but slightly from the hand-hackling process used in the preparation of flax. The hackle board consists&nbsp;of a wooden block studded with strong, tapered and sharp-pointed steel prongs. A series of such hackle boards is used&nbsp;in the progressive hackling operation, the prongs diminishing</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
