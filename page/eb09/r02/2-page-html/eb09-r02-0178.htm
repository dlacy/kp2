<p><span class="font1">all the comforts of life, they spend the more in the purchase of luxuries, the production of which increases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A fundamental part of the teaching of Rodbertus is his theory of social development. He recognized three stages in the economic&nbsp;progress of mankind : (1) the ancient heathen period in which&nbsp;property in human beings was the rule ; (2) the period of private&nbsp;property in land and capital ; (3) the period, still remote, of property as dependent on service or desert. The goal of the human&nbsp;race is to be one society organized on a communistic basis ; only&nbsp;in that way can the principle that every man be rewarded according to his work be realized. In this communistic or socialistic&nbsp;state of the future land and capital will be national property, and&nbsp;the entire national production will be under national control ; and&nbsp;means will be taken so to estimate the labour of each citizen that&nbsp;he shall be rewarded according to its precise amount. An immense&nbsp;staff of state officials will be required for this function. As we have&nbsp;already said, Rodbertus believed that this stage of social development is yet far distant ; he thought that five centuries will need&nbsp;to pass away before the ethical force of the people can be equal to it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From temperament, culture, and social position Rodbertus was averse to agitation as a means of hastening the new era ; and, in&nbsp;the measures which he recommends for making the transition&nbsp;towards it he showed a scrupulous regard for the existing interests&nbsp;of the capitalists and landholders. He proposed that those two&nbsp;classes should be left in full possession of their present share of the&nbsp;national income, but that the workers should reap the benefit of&nbsp;the increasing production. To secure them this increment of production he proposed that the state should fix a “ normal working&nbsp;day ” for the various trades, a normal day’s work, and a legal wage,&nbsp;the amount of which should be revised periodically, and raised&nbsp;according to the increase of production, the better workman receiving a better wage. By measures such as these carried out by the&nbsp;state in order to correct the evils of competition would Rodbertus&nbsp;seek to make the transition into the socialistic era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The economic work of Rodbertus is therefore an attempt made in a temperate and scientific spirit to elucidate the evil tendencies&nbsp;inherent in the competitive system, especially as exemplified in the&nbsp;operation of the iron law of wages. The remedy he proposes is&nbsp;a state management of production and distribution, which shall&nbsp;extend more and more, till we arrive at a complete and universal&nbsp;socialism,—and all based on the principle that as labour is the&nbsp;source of value so to the labourer should all wealth belong. It is&nbsp;therefore an attempt to place socialism on a scientific basis ; and&nbsp;he is certainly entitled to be regarded as one of the founders of&nbsp;“scientific socialism ” (see Socialism).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RODEZ, a town of France, chef-lieu of the department of Aveyron and the see of a bishop, 412 miles south of&nbsp;Paris by the railway which continues to Béziers, is built&nbsp;at a height of 2077 feet on a promontory surrounded by&nbsp;the Aveyron, a sub-tributary of the Garonne by the Tarn.&nbsp;In population—14,425 inhabitants (15,333 in the commune)&nbsp;in 1881—it ranks next to the industrial town of Millau.&nbsp;The cathedral was built between 1277 and 1535. A great&nbsp;flamboyant rose window and a gallery in the same style&nbsp;are the chief features of the principal façade. Each transept has a fine Gothic doorway. At the north side of the&nbsp;building rises a tower (erected in the beginning of the&nbsp;l6th century) which ranks by its height as one of the&nbsp;wonders of the south of France, and bears aloft a colossal&nbsp;statue of the Virgin surrounded by the four evangelists.&nbsp;The interior has a fine rood loft and several interesting&nbsp;tombs. The episcopal palace with its collection of sculptured stones; the church of St Amans, in the Romanesque&nbsp;style, but entirely restored externally in the l8th century ;&nbsp;and several curious old houses of the 13th, 15th, and 16th&nbsp;centuries, such as the Hôtel d’Armagnac, on the site of&nbsp;the old palace of the counts, also deserve to be mentioned.&nbsp;The ruins of a Roman amphitheatre still exist, and the&nbsp;town is supplied with water by the old Roman aqueduct&nbsp;recently restored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rodez, called Segodunum under the Gauls and Ruthena under the Romans, was the capital of a tribe allied to the Arvernians. In&nbsp;the 4th century it adopted the Christian faith and St Amans, its&nbsp;first bishop, was elected in 401. During the Middle Ages contests were rife between the bishops in the “city” and the counts&nbsp;in the “bourg.” The Albigenses were defeated near Rodez in&nbsp;1210. The countship of Rodez depended in succession on the&nbsp;count of Toulouse, on the king of France, and from the close of the&nbsp;13th century on the count of Armagnac. From 1360 to 1368 the&nbsp;English held the town. After the confiscation of the estates of the&nbsp;Armagnacs in 1473 it passed to the dukes of Alençon and then to&nbsp;the D’Albrets. Henry IV. finally annexed it to the crown of&nbsp;France. Neither the Protestants nor the Leaguers any more than&nbsp;in earlier days the Albigenses were able to make themselves masters&nbsp;of Rodez.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RODNEY, George Brydges Rodney, Baron (1718-1792), English admiral, second son of Henry Rodney of Walton-on-Thames, was born there on 19th February 1718.&nbsp;His father had served in Spain under the earl of Peterborough, and on quitting the army obtained command of&nbsp;the king’s yacht. George was sent to Harrow when quite&nbsp;young, and on leaving entered the navy. By warrant&nbsp;dated 2lst June 1732 he was appointed as volunteer on&nbsp;board the “ Sunderland,” a fourth-rate. While serving on&nbsp;the Mediterranean station under Admiral Haddock he was&nbsp;made lieutenant in the “Dolphin,” his promotion dating&nbsp;15th February 1739. In 1742 he attained the rank of&nbsp;post-captain, having been appointed to the “Plymouth,”&nbsp;9th November. After minor services of an active character in home waters, he obtained command of the “Eagle,”&nbsp;sixty guns, and in this ship took part in Hawke’s victory&nbsp;off Ushant, 14th October 1747, over the French fleet under&nbsp;L’Etanduère. On that day Rodney gained his first laurels&nbsp;for gallantry, under a chief to whom he was in a measure&nbsp;indebted for subsequent success. On 9th May 1749 he&nbsp;was appointed governor and commander-in-chief of Newfoundland, with the rank of commodore, it being usual at&nbsp;that time to appoint a naval officer, chiefly on account of&nbsp;the fishery interests. Returning home, he was elected M.P.&nbsp;for Saltash in May 1751, and married his first wife, Jane&nbsp;Compton, sister to the earl of Northampton, 3d February&nbsp;1753. During the Seven Years’ War Rodney rendered&nbsp;important service. In 1757 he had a share in the expedition against Rochefort, commanding the “Dublin,” seventy-four. Next year, in the same ship, he served under&nbsp;Admiral Boscawen at the taking of Louisburg (Cape&nbsp;Breton). On 19th May 1759 Rodney became a rear-admiral and was shortly after given command of a small&nbsp;squadron intended to destroy a large number of flat-bottomed boats and stores which were being collected at&nbsp;Havre for an invasion of the English coasts. He bombarded the town for two days and nights without ceasing,&nbsp;and inflicted great loss of war-material on the enemy. In&nbsp;July 1760, with another small squadron, he succeeded in&nbsp;taking many more of the enemy’s flat-bottomed boats and&nbsp;in blockading the coast as far as Dieppe. Elected M.P.&nbsp;for Penryn in 1761, he was in October of that year&nbsp;appointed commander-in-chief of the Leeward Islands&nbsp;station, and within the first three months of 1762 had&nbsp;reduced the important island of Martinique, while both&nbsp;St Lucia and Grenada had surrendered to his squadron.&nbsp;During the siege of Fort Royal his seamen and marines&nbsp;rendered splendid service bn shore. At the peace of 1763&nbsp;Admiral Rodney returned home, having been during his&nbsp;absence made vice-admiral of the Blue and voted the&nbsp;thanks of both Houses of Parliament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1764 Rodney was created a baronet by patent of 21st January, and the same year he married Henrietta, daughter&nbsp;of John Clies of Lisbon. From 1765 to 1770 he was&nbsp;governor of Greenwich Hospital, and on the dissolution&nbsp;of parliament in 1768 he successfully contested Northampton at a ruinous cost. When appointed commander-in-chief&nbsp;of the Jamaica station in 1771 he lost his Greenwich post,&nbsp;but a few months later received the office of rear-admiral&nbsp;of Great Britain. Till 1774 he held the Jamaica com</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
