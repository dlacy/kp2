<p><span class="font3">in Dalmatian </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font3"> before </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font3"> are always preserved as velars, and in south Sardinian and in Rumanian the palatalization is more recent,&nbsp;and secondary. The preservation of the tenues between vowels&nbsp;as breathed fortes is peculiar to Rumano-Dalmatian, but as north&nbsp;Sardinian used breathed lenes in their place, while the dialect of&nbsp;Nuoro, in Sardinia, preserved the fortes, we have every ground for&nbsp;assuming that central and south Sardinia also possessed either&nbsp;fortes or lenes in earlier times. Moreover, south Italy, Sicily and&nbsp;a large part of central ltaly as far as the Apennines replace the&nbsp;old Latm tenues either with breathed fortes or breathed lenes,&nbsp;in marked contrast to the regions of the Po, to Gallic and the Iberian&nbsp;group. All these phenomena may perhaps be explained in conjunction with two historical events. By the abandonment of the&nbsp;province of Dacia (in a.d. 270), Rumanian lost its close touch with&nbsp;the languages of nearest affinity; and the division of the empire&nbsp;under Diocletian and Constantine.necessarily entailed a linguistic&nbsp;division. At that epoch the linguistic conditions were roughly as&nbsp;follows :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The principal changes in the vowel-system, especially the development of qualitative beside quantitative variations, had been accomplished, but there was still a difference between I and « and p. The old future had disappeared, and no tendency to produce a&nbsp;substitute had as yet appeared. The Latin pluperfect subjunctive&nbsp;still maintained its old usage, probably also the imperfect subjunctive and the future perfect. In declensions the type </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">membrum,&nbsp;-a,</span><span class="font3"> had begun to spread; but </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Corpus<sub>t</sub> -Ora<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font3"> was still in existence.&nbsp;Sardinia seems to have been, perhaps owing to its isolation, the&nbsp;first to have detached, itself from this group. For it. was not content with differentiating </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font3"> and t, but it also retains whereas&nbsp;the East-Rumanian and an ltalian group suppressed. </span><span class="font2">-5, </span><span class="font3">and in&nbsp;consequence also the difference between, the nominative and the&nbsp;accusative singular. This and the levelling of neuters in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">-us</span><span class="font3"> and&nbsp;masculines in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">-u</span><span class="font3"> made it possible for the types </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">membra</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">corpora&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">to spread at the expense of the type </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">loci,</span><span class="font2">—a </span><span class="font3">possibility of which&nbsp;South ltalian and Rumanian made the fullest use.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">On the given basis the various languages carried on their various developments, influenced partly by contiguity of other idioms,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ö</span><span class="font3">by causes unknown to us. Among neighbouring idioms, had by right of its degree of civilization and its political&nbsp;power great influence in giving Rumanian and South Italian a&nbsp;similar direction, and that at a time when every trace of a geographical connexion between these two language-çroups had&nbsp;long vanished. Thus, the replacing of the construction “ 1 will&nbsp;come ” by “1 will that I come ” took its rise in Greece and was&nbsp;passed on to Rumania and Apulia.. The rise of the new future&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">voïu Cantd<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font3"> “ 1 will sing,” in Rumanian is probably due to Greek&nbsp;influence, ln Latin itself both </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ille Caballus</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Caballus ille</span><span class="font3"> are&nbsp;found, the position depending on the accentual conditions of the&nbsp;sentence. Then the loss of 5 made room for the form </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Caballlu] ille&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">with a victory for the inverted order, ln Rumania alone this was&nbsp;the actual process, under the influence of the surrounding speech—&nbsp;Illyrian or Bulgarian, or perhaps independently of them, in this&nbsp;latter case serving as prototype to these languages. Dalmatian&nbsp;and South Italian, on the other hand, were so closely connected&nbsp;with the languages that preserved 5 and therefore prefixed the&nbsp;article that in this particular they separated from Rumanian.&nbsp;This is not the place to show how the Rumanian vocabulary and&nbsp;the structure of words was permeated markedly by elements from&nbsp;Slav, less markedly by elements from Turkish, Mod. Greek and&nbsp;Hungarian, which gave the language an alien appearance in point&nbsp;of vocabulary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In its consonants, and, as far as one can judge, in its morphology,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dalmatian has preserved the stamp of antiquity. But in its vowel-system there are marked changes, especially in the substitution of diphthongs for close vowels, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font3"> changing </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font3"> to e, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span class="font3"> through the w&nbsp;stage to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">oi, i</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ei, ç</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">au, e</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ai.</span><span class="font3"> Diphthongs such as they appear&nbsp;also in lstrian and Abruzzian, so that we must presuppose some&nbsp;sort of connexion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">lt may be that Sardinian took another course of development because (a.d. 458) the island was rent from Rome and incorporated&nbsp;in the African empire of Genseric, king of the Vandals. Therefore&nbsp;the sympathies of Sardinia were alienated from Italy, and turned&nbsp;on the one hand towards Africa (and unfortunately we have no&nbsp;information as to the “ latinity ” of this region), on the other towards the Iberian peninsula. These conditions lasted for a while,&nbsp;but later we find Genoa and Pisa fighting at intervals for supremacy&nbsp;in Sardinia, their organization being in many points identical&nbsp;with that of the island. On the whole, this new combination has&nbsp;not materially affected the language, especially in Logodoro.. The&nbsp;vowel system (of great antiquity), as well as the velar pronunciation&nbsp;of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font3"> before </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font3"> t, remained unchanged, neither did they get as far as&nbsp;to adopt the future-forms current on the mainland; on the contrary,&nbsp;the Sardinians arrived independently and later at their usage of&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">depo Cantare</span><span class="font3"> or </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">haia a cantor.</span><span class="font3"> But the use of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">ipse</span><span class="font3"> as an article in&nbsp;Sardinia, Mallorca, and in the earliest times also in the Catalanian-Gascon area, clearly proves the linguistic connexion which for a time&nbsp;covered this area, and we may also see some connexion in the fact&nbsp;that the lenes became voiced between vowels. On the whole,&nbsp;and in spite of everything, Sardinian is the most archaic of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Romance languages. Owing to its retaining </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">s,</span><span class="font3"> it has failed to extend the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">membra-tempora</span><span class="font3"> types of formation, indeed it has almost rejected them entirely. It has retained the imperfect subjunctive&nbsp;to this day, and as a corollary it has lost the pluperfect of that mood.&nbsp;And though every Romance language.has a number of Latin words&nbsp;that are not common to the rest, yet in this language the number of&nbsp;these </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">&amp;πα£ Xcybutva</span><span class="font3"> is greater than in others, and it is noteworthy&nbsp;that these have here survived such common expressions as </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">domo,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">“ house,” </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">rnannu,</span><span class="font3"> “ great,” with other examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The East-Rumanian group (coupled with Sardinia) finds its counterpart in the great group based upon the Latinity of Gaul<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>the lberian peninsula, and north ltaly. This group contains a&nbsp;considerable number of fundamental peculiarities in phonology,&nbsp;morphology and vocabulary which prima facie lead us to assume a&nbsp;fairly long period of contact..</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The chief of these peculiarities is the final change of the vowel-system, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font3"> the loss of the distinction between </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font3"> and 1, between </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">0 </span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ü</span><span class="font3"> ; then the change of breathed plosives and fricatives between&nbsp;vowels into voiced plosives and fricatives respectively; the use of&nbsp;the Jjluperfect subjunctive instead of the lost imperfect subjunctive&nbsp;(ltal. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">contasse,</span><span class="font3"> Fr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">que je chantasse,</span><span class="font3"> Sp. nmlase, Port, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cantasse),&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">the formation of a new future from the infinitive of the verb and the&nbsp;present, or (as the case may be) the imperfect or perfect of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">habere,&nbsp;e.g.</span><span class="font3"> Ital. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Canterb<sub>1</sub> Canterei<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font3"> Fr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">je chanterai, chanterais,</span><span class="font3"> Sp. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cantaré,&nbsp;cantaria.</span><span class="font3"> If it is safe to assume that this latter formation had its&nbsp;origin in places where we find it most firmly rooted, we are led to&nbsp;assign it to the north of France. For it is only there that both&nbsp;elements in the formation are inseparably connected from the&nbsp;beginning of our record. In the old Provençal the two constituent&nbsp;parts are still, separable; in the oldest Spanish and Portuguese&nbsp;their position is not fixed </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font3"> the auxiliary may follow or precede&nbsp;the verb). In north Italy we frequently find the form </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">avrb Cantare&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">instead of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cantarb<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font3"> obviously because this formation is not properly&nbsp;acclimatized. But at any rate it is clear that the change of function&nbsp;from </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">cantare habeo</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Cantabo</span><span class="font3"> belongs, to the time when the three&nbsp;great groups were still in close contact, and the evidence of the&nbsp;Latin texts falls into line with this view, showing this construction&nbsp;well established from the second half of the 4th century.@@<sup>1</sup> ln the&nbsp;vocabulary we must note, among other things, the introduction of&nbsp;Germanic words, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. elmo,</span><span class="font3"> Fr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">heaume,</span><span class="font3"> Sp. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">yelmo,</span><span class="font3"> “helmet”;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">harpa,</span><span class="font3"> “harp,” Ital. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">arpa,</span><span class="font3"> Fr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">harpe,</span><span class="font3"> Sp. and Port, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">arpa; medus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">“ meed,” which is found in Antimus and lsidore, but disappears&nbsp;later (cf. O. Fr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">mies,</span><span class="font3"> “meed”); </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">waidanian,</span><span class="font3"> Ital. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">guadagnare,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Fr. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">gagner,</span><span class="font3"> Sp. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">guadaüar,</span><span class="font3"> and many more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The further steps in the process of differentiation were conditioned by the breaking up of the Roman empire by the great migrations. The. establishment of the rule of the Franks in north&nbsp;Gaul, of the Visigoths in south Gaul and the lberian peninsula,&nbsp;loosened old ties, created new nations and in consequence new and&nbsp;independent groups of languages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The Iberian group was marked primarily by a striking simplicity in its flexions. The three-case system was given up at an early&nbsp;stage, even in prehistoric times, and has left no traces whatever.&nbsp;Owing to the preservation of -j the type </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">membra</span><span class="font3"> was doomed to&nbsp;perish, and thus we find, from the beginning of our record and&nbsp;therefore presumably soon after the great cleavage took place,&nbsp;the prevalence in nouns of the following simple rule: sing, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">-e,&nbsp;-o, -a*,*</span><span class="font3"> jjlur..</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">-es, -os, -as.</span><span class="font3"> The loss of the dative may have some&nbsp;connexion with the fact that the form </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">illui</span><span class="font3"> for the 3rd personal&nbsp;pronoun had not yet established itself; and the desire for uniformity may have ousted the nominative of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">o-</span><span class="font3"> stems. There are&nbsp;analogies in the conjugation. The pluperfect indicative was preserved, and even (largely) with a Latin significance, but in the&nbsp;region of . flexion much simplification took place, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font3"> uniformity of&nbsp;accentuation in the three conjugations, marked reduction of the&nbsp;s- perfect and w- perfect forms and a great reduction in the number&nbsp;of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">u-</span><span class="font3"> participles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The vocabulary is characterized by certain archaisms, and still more by the fact that a series of common ideas are rendered by&nbsp;new words limited in use to the lberian peninsula. Thus we have&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">querer (quaerere)</span><span class="font3"> instead of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">velle ; quedar (quietare)</span><span class="font3"> instead of&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">manere; collar</span><span class="font3"> (deriv. uncertain) for </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tacere; Hablar (fabulare),&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">“to speak”; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">llegar (plicare),</span><span class="font3"> “to arrive”; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">dejar</span><span class="font3"> (?) instead of&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Iacrare<sub>1</sub></span><span class="font3"> &amp;c. Further, we may mention the preference of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">tenere</span><span class="font3"> to&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">habere</span><span class="font3"> evon for the formation of perfect-forms, of which examples&nbsp;are to be found in Orosius, and of </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">magis</span><span class="font3"> to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">plus</span><span class="font3"> for expressing&nbsp;comparisons, for which also we may find examples in Latin authors&nbsp;or the Iberian peninsula. The influence of the Goths or Suevi and&nbsp;Vandals on the vocabulary is inconsiderable, and when we trace it&nbsp;it is not easy to explain; </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font3"> Galician </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">laverca,</span><span class="font3"> “lark,” is clearly&nbsp;from a western Gothic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">*lawerka,</span><span class="font3"> but it is difficult to see why the name&nbsp;for this bird should have been supplied by the Germanic. To sum&nbsp;up, one may say that the Latin of Iberia was a self-contained&nbsp;language, at first showing little modification by influences from&nbsp;lberian, or later by those from Germanic; further, that its development was slow, and that it aimed at simplicity.</span></p>
