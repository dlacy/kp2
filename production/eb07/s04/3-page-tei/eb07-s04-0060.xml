To restrain the violence of party fury, which so widely prevailed, a treaty was concluded with France, by which that power agreed to maintain a large military force in the country, until the Spanish army could be organized. This was certainly a wise measure in the circumstances ; for Spain, if left to itself, would probably have fallen into irretrievable confusion. It was divided by two parties, who mortally hated each other ; and the bonds of society, already shaken loose by years of war and unrestrained licentiousness, required little more to dissolve them altogether. The reports from the provinces were appalling ; the treasury was empty ; home and foreign credit were alike destroyed ; and trade and commerce were paralyzed. The personal moderation of the king led to the formation of a plot by the absolutists, to compel him to ab dicate, and to raise his brother Carlos to the throne. This was the origin of the Carlists, who make so conspicuous a figure in the sequel. An attempt to restore the inquisition was happily frustrated. In May 1824, a decree of amnesty appeared ; but it was a mere mockery, for it contained so many exemptions, that those who were to enjoy its benefits seemed rather to form the exception than the rule. The year 1825 was disturbed by several insurrections of the Carlists, which were attended with numerous executions. The independence of the American colonies was recognised by foreign powers, but Spain herself did not acknowledge it till the year 1836. The general interruption of commerce and industry, with the flight of many persons of property, occasioned much distress. The disturbances continued for some years, attended with the same marks of feebleness on the part of the government, and a continuance of general distress. It was a period of terror for the liberals, who were plundered and imprisoned on the slightest pretexts. The army, purged of all officers suspected of liberalism, was recruited by a motley throng of adventurers, friars, smugglers, mechanics, publicans, and muleteers, who had been officers in the guerilla bands of Catalonia and Navarre. The ranks being replenished in this manner, the French troops were enabled to evacuate Spain in 1828. Some insurrections, which had broken out during the preceding year, were suppressed without much trouble; and in spite of the arbitrary rule of the Carlists, their tortuous policy, and their open violence, the country began to show some symptoms of improvement.</p><p>In May 1829, Ferdinand lost his queen, and on the 9th of November following, her place was supplied by a Neapolitan princess, Christina Maria. Unblessed with issue by his three former marriages, the hope and the desire of having a child of his own to inherit his honours and preserve the throne to his dynasty, probably hastened the nuptials of Ferdinand. The French revolution of 1830 caused much less sensation in Spain than might have been ex pected. The fact is, the liberal party had been so devour ed or dispersed by the sword, the scaffold, exile, and the dungeon, that in the country itself it was not powerful ; but a rash and ill-judged attempt in the constitutional cause was made from without. General Mina assembled a body of refu gees and others, and invaded the Basque provinces ; but they were speedily repelled, and sought refuge in France. Mean while, some events of momentous importance had taken place in the royal family. The Infant Don Carlos was presumptive heir of the throne ; the succession to the Spa nish crown had been subjected to the Salic law by Philip V., so that, as matters stood at present, no daughter of the reigning king could interrupt its descent to his brother. The queen of Ferdinand' was about to make him a father, and in order to secure the crown to his own child, should the issue prove a female, he resolved on revoking the Salic law, which excludes females. It is important to observe, that, in 1789, Charles IV. issued a pragmatic sanction, having</p><p>the force of law, and establishing the regular succession to the crown of Spain in females as well as males. The Cortes of 1812 likewise solemnly revoked the law of Philip V., and reestablished the old law of the Partidas. But as Ferdinand had annulled the acts of that assembly, and as the decree of Charles IV. might be cavilled at by the fierce and intolerant party who wished that Carlos should succeed to the throne, the king obtained the records of the Cortes of 1789 regarding the succession, and on the mar gin opposite the decree of Charles IV., with his own hand, wrote a decree to the same effect. The minister, Calomarde (a Carlist at heart), remonstrated with the king against its publication ; but Ferdinand was firm, and ordered the resolution to be carried into effect. In compliance with this demand, the whole was forwarded to the council ; and in the gazette of the 6th of April 1830, the edict was published to the world. It was likewise regularly proclaimed in the streets of Madrid with the usual formalities. Ferdinand's foresight was justified. The infant with which the queen presented him was a daughter, born on the 10th of October, and christened Isabella Maria Luisa.</p><p>But the Carlists did not wait for the expected birth of the heir to the throne to show how terribly the publication of the decree had staggered them. They rushed into hasty plots against the government, which were detected before they were ripe for execution ; and in various ways showed their chagrin and irritation. In order to render the succession still more secure, Ferdinand called a meeting of the Cortes, before which the edict of Philip V. was again repealed, and his daughter, the Infante Isabel, recognised as princess of the Asturias. An insurrection broke out in Cadiz in 1831, at the head of which was General Torrijas. It was soon quelled, and the leader, with fifty-three companions, fled to Malaga, where they were taken prisoners, and all shot in cold blood. The other events of this year are unimportant, with the exception of a sudden illness of the king, which so excited the hopes of the Carlists, that they strenuously urged their master to take advantage of the circumstance, and at once seize the crown. This re markable fact shows with what spirit they were animated. It was not a love of justice, but ambition, and a spirit of vindictive hostility to the constitutionalists, who now began to be tolerated, that instigated them to attempt the exaltation of Carlos to the throne, and that at all hazards, even before he possessed the semblance of a claim to it; for while Ferdinand lived, by what right could he grasp at his sceptre? Yet his partisans extol his magnanimity in refusing it at this time.</p><p>In the course of the year 1832, Ferdinand had an alarming relapse of his disease, during the paroxysms of which a transaction took place of the utmost importance in itself, and which has been very differently represented by different parties. It was the signing of a decree by which he re stored the Salic law to full operation, and the further confirming the disinheriting of his daughter, by annulling his testament in her favour. It is certain that the ministers strenuously urged him to adopt this measure ; and that they were under Carlist influence, is no less certain. Every thing was accomplished to their wishes ; the document was signed and properly secured, and the king appeared to have fallen into the sleep of death. His dissolution indeed was announced ; but, contrary to all human expectation, the disease took a favourable turn ; all symptoms of immediate danger disappeared, and consciousness and understanding were restored to Ferdinand. The use which he made of the lucid interval thus vouchsafed to him, was to dismiss his ministers, to appoint the queen regent during his illness, and to undo what he had lately done regarding the succession, thus restoring to his daughter her right to the throne. The decree to this effect was issued on the last day of the year. The former ordinance, he declared, had been extort</p></body></text></TEI>
