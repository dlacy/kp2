<p><span class="font0">to be situated in the depths of Guiana. He returned to England the same year, and soon afterwards published an account of his expedition. In the following year he was one of the&nbsp;admirals in the successful expedition against Cadiz, under&nbsp;the command of Howard and the Earl of Essex : and in&nbsp;1597 he sailed with the same commanders against the&nbsp;/Yzores. Soon after these expeditions we find him assiduously engaged in parliamentary business. His speeches&nbsp;evince a knowledge of political economy far superior to any&nbsp;man of his time. In 1600 he was sent on a joint embassy&nbsp;with Lord Cobham to Flanders, and on his return made&nbsp;governor of Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Queen Elizabeth died in the beginning of the year 1603 ; and with her Raleigh’s glory and felicity sunk, never to rise&nbsp;again. Upon the accession of James, Sir Walter lost his&nbsp;interest at court, was stripped of his preferments, and accused of a plot against the king. He was arraigned at Winchester, and, on his trial, insulted with the most shocking&nbsp;brutality by the famous Coke, attorney-general, who influenced the jury to convict him without any legal proof of his&nbsp;guilt. After a month’s imprisonment, however, in daily&nbsp;expectation of his execution, he was reprieved and sent to&nbsp;the Tower; and his estates were given to Car, earl of Somerset, the king’s favourite. During this confinement he&nbsp;wrote many of his most valuable pieces, particularly his&nbsp;History of the World. In March 1615, after sixteen years’&nbsp;imprisonment, he obtained his liberty, and immediately began to prepare for another voyage to Guiana, which proved&nbsp;equally abortive and ruinous. In the year 1618, he returned&nbsp;from this fatal voyage to England, where he was soon afterwards seized, imprisoned, and beheaded. He was sacrificed&nbsp;by the pusillanimous monarch to appease the Spaniards, who,&nbsp;whilst Raleigh lived, thought every part of their dominions&nbsp;in danger. He was executed in Old Palace Yard, and buried&nbsp;in St Margaret’s adjoining, in the sixty-sixth year of his age.&nbsp;His behaviour on the scaffold was manly, unaffected, cheerful, and easy. Being asked by the executioner which way&nbsp;he would lay his head, he answered, “ So the heart be right,&nbsp;it is no matter which way the head lies.” He was a man&nbsp;of admirable parts, extensive knowledge, undaunted resolution, and perhaps the best prose writer of his age. His&nbsp;great work, the History of the World, is a truly remarkable&nbsp;performance, both for matter and for style. It has often&nbsp;been reprinted in folio. An edition of his whole works was&nbsp;published at Oxford in 1829, in eight volumes octavo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RALPH, James, an ingenious historical and political writer, of whose birth and country nothing has been ascertained. He was first known as a schoolmaster in Philadelphia, in North America. He came to England about the&nbsp;beginning of the reign of George I. and wrote some things&nbsp;in the dramatic way, which were not received with great&nbsp;applause ; but though he did not succeed as a poet, he was&nbsp;a very ingenious prose-writer. He wrote a History of England, commencing with the Stuarts, which is much esteemed; and so also were his political essays and pamphlets,&nbsp;some of which were looked upon as masterpieces. His last&nbsp;publication, the Case of Authors by Profession, is an excellent and entertaining performance. He died in 1762.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAMA, or Ramla, a considerable town of Palestine, situated in one of the most fertile and extensive districts of the Holy Land ; though at the time when Dr Clarke visited&nbsp;the country it was almost deserted, in consequence of the ravages of the plague. It seems doubtful, however, whether&nbsp;this was the ancient city described in Scripture. Some ascribe its origin to the Moslems ; yet this can scarcely have&nbsp;been the case, as it is distinctly mentioned by St Jerome.&nbsp;Rama was a splendid city, well fortified, exceedingly populous, adorned with stately buildings, and abounding in all&nbsp;the luxuries of the East, during the time of the Crusaders.&nbsp;It was one of the first cities that fell into the hands of the&nbsp;Crusaders.

The country&nbsp;in the vicinity is very wild, being overrun with woods, deep&nbsp;jungle, and dreadfully infested with tigers. There is but little cultivation, the peasants being chiefly employed in the&nbsp;breeding of cattle. In this hilly tract there is a very mild&nbsp;race of men, who subsist on game, wild roots, herbs and&nbsp;fruits, and a little grain, which they purchase from the farmers in exchange for drugs, honey, and wax. It is fifty-miles north-east from Seringapatam. Long. 77. 33. E. Lat.&nbsp;12. 44. N.</span></p>
