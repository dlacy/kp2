among the Jews, is a place where that people met to worship God. Authors are not agreed about the time when the Jews first began to have synagogues. Some suppose them as old as the ceremonial law, and others fix their beginning to the times after the Babylonish captivity. They erected synagogues not only in towns and cities, but also in the country, especially near rivers, that they might have water for their purifications and ceremonial washings. No synagogue was built in any town unless there were ten persons of leisure in it ; but there might be many in one town, or in one quarter of a town, provided it was very populous. Jerusalem is said to have contained 480. The chief things belonging to a synagogue were, 1. the ark or chest, made after the model of the ark of the covenant, containing the Pentateuch ; 2. the pulpit and desk in the middle of the synagogue, in which he that was to read or expound the law stood ; 3. the seats or pews for the people ; 4. the lamps to give light at evening service, and the feast of dedication ; 5. rooms or apartments for the utensils and alms-chest. The synagogue was governed by a council or assembly, over whom was a president, called the Ruler of the Synagogue. These are sometimes called Chiefs of the Jews, the Rulers, the Priests or Elders, the Governors, the Overseers, the Fathers of the Synagogue. Their business was to punish the disobedient, by censures, by excommunication, or by penalties, such as fines and scourging ; to take care of the alms, which are frequently called by the name of righteousness. The chief ruler, or one of the rulers, gave permission to read and expound the law, and appointed who should do it. In every synagogue there were several ministers, who had different offices assigned to them. Service was performed three times a day, namely, in the morning, in the afternoon, and at night. At the time of morning sacrifice, evening sacrifice, and after the evening sacrifice on Monday, Thursday, and Saturday, there was a more forcible obligation upon the people to attend than upon the other days.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
