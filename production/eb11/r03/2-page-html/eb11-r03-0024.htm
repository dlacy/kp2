<p><span class="font0">time Miss Stewart resisted the king’s importunities, though her behaviour was far from modest and “ she had no aversion to&nbsp;scandal.” She had numerous suitors, including the duke of&nbsp;Buckingham and Francis Digby, son of the earl of Bristol,&nbsp;whose unrequited love for her was celebrated by Dryden. Her&nbsp;beauty appeared to her contemporaries to be only equalled by&nbsp;her childish silliness; but her letters to her husband, preserved&nbsp;in the British Museum, are not devoid of good sense and feeling.&nbsp;The king’s infatuation was so great that when the queen’s life&nbsp;was despaired of in 1663, it was reported that he intended to&nbsp;marry Miss Stewart, and four years later he was considering&nbsp;the possibility of obtaining a divorce to enable him to make her&nbsp;his wife. This was at a time when Charles feared he was in&nbsp;danger of losing her as his mistress, her hand being sought in&nbsp;marriage by Charles Stuart, duke of Richmond and Lennox.&nbsp;The duchess of Cleveland, who was losing her hold on the king’s&nbsp;affections, is reported hy Hamilton to have led the king to Miss&nbsp;Stewart’s apartment at midnight when Richmond was closeted&nbsp;with her, and the duke was immediately expelled from court.&nbsp;In March 1667 the lady eloped from WhitehalI with Richmond&nbsp;and married him secretly in the country. The king, who was&nbsp;greatly enraged, suspected Clarendon of being privy to the&nbsp;marriage, and, according to Burnet, deprived him of office for&nbsp;this offence. The duchess of Richmond, however, soon returned&nbsp;to court, where she remained for many years; and although&nbsp;she was disfigured by small-pox in 1668, she retained her hold&nbsp;on the king’s affections. Her husband was sent as ambassador&nbsp;to Denmark, where he died in 1672. The duchess was present&nbsp;at the birth of the prince of Wales, son of James II., in 1688,&nbsp;being one of those who signed the certificate before the council&nbsp;She died in 1702, leaving a valuable property to her nephew the&nbsp;earl of Blantyre, whose seat was named Lennoxlove after her.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICHTER, ADRIAN LUDWIG (1803-1884), German painter and etcher, was born at Dresden in 1803, the son of the engraver&nbsp;Karl August Richter, from whom he received his training; but&nbsp;he was strongly influenced by Erhard and Chodowiecki. He&nbsp;was the most popular, and in many ways the most typicaI&nbsp;German illustrator of the middle of the 19th century. His work&nbsp;is as typically German and homely as are the fairy-tales of&nbsp;Grimm. Richter visited Italy from 1823-26, and his “ Thunderstorm in the Sabine Mountains ” at the Staedel Institute in&nbsp;Frankfort is one of the rare Italian subjects from his brush. In&nbsp;1828 he worked as designer for the Meissen factory, and in 1841&nbsp;he became professor and head of the landscape atelier at the&nbsp;Dresden Academy. The Dresden Gallery owns one of his best&nbsp;and most characteristic paintings in the “ Bridal Procession in&nbsp;a Spring Landscape.” He died at Loschwitz near Dresden&nbsp;in 1884.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHTER, ERNST FRIEDRICH EDUARD (1808-1879), German musical theorist, was born at Grosschonau in Saxony,&nbsp;on the 24th of October 1808. He first studied music at Zittau,&nbsp;and afterwards at Leipzig, where he attained so high a reputation&nbsp;that in 1843 he was appointed professor of harmony and counterpoint at the conservatorium of music, then newly founded by&nbsp;Mendelssohn. On the death of Hauptmann on the 3rd of&nbsp;January 1868, he was elected cantor of the Thomasschule,&nbsp;which office he retained until his death on the 9th of April 1879.&nbsp;He is best known by three theoretical works—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lehrbuch der&nbsp;Harmonie, Lehre vom Contrapunct</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lehre von der Fuge—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">valuable textbooks known to English students through the&nbsp;excellent translation by Franklin Taylor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHTER, EUGEN (1839-1906), German politician, was born on the 30th of July 1839 at Düsseldorf. After attending&nbsp;the universities of Bonn, Heidelberg and Berlin, he entered the&nbsp;government service, being stationed in his native town. In 1864&nbsp;he was chosen burgomaster of Neuwied; but he was already&nbsp;known for his Liberal opinions, and the government refused to&nbsp;confirm the appointment. He was hereupon transferred to&nbsp;Bromberg, in East Prussia, which to an inhabitant of the Rhineland was the worst form of exile, and in consequence he resigned&nbsp;his place in the public service. He now went to Berlin, where&nbsp;he earned his living as a journalist. He was the most consistent&nbsp;advocate of those doctrines of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">laissez faire</span><span class="font0"> and individual liberty&nbsp;which the Germans call </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manchestertum.</span><span class="font0"> He was also keenly&nbsp;interested in the attempts made at that period to create cooperative societies among the working men, and wrote a work&nbsp;on co-operative stores. It was not long before he came into&nbsp;conflict with the government; an electioneering pamphlet&nbsp;published in 1867 was confiscated; he was put on his trial but&nbsp;acquitted. In 1867 he was elected a member of the newly&nbsp;formed Reichstag, and in 1869 of the Prussian parliament. He&nbsp;soon became one of the most influential politicians in Germany.&nbsp;A member of the Progressive party, in 1880 one of the founders,&nbsp;and eventually the leader, of the Freisinnige, he was always in&nbsp;opposition. Next to Windthorst </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> he was Bismarck’s most&nbsp;dangerous opponent. After the great change of policy in 1878,&nbsp;for a time his influence was a great impediment to the government; as a consistent adherent to free trade, he was the leader&nbsp;of the opposition to the introduction of protection, to the new&nbsp;colonial policy, and to State Socialism. Itwas after 1880 that he&nbsp;raised the cry </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bismarck muss fort.</span><span class="font0"> He always took a great part&nbsp;in debates on the military and naval establishments, in vain&nbsp;opposing the constant increase of army and navy. It was his&nbsp;refusal to support the government proposals in 1893 for an&nbsp;increase of the army which led to the break up of his party: he&nbsp;was left with only eleven followers; and, except among the middle&nbsp;class of Berlin and some other Prussian cities, the old Radical&nbsp;party, of which he was the chief representative, from that time&nbsp;had influence in the country. In 1885 he founded the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Freisinnige Zeitung,</span><span class="font0"> which he edited himself; of his numerous&nbsp;brochures the most successful was his attack on Socialism,&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">SoziMemokratische Zukunftsbilder</span><span class="font0"> (Berlin, 1891), a&nbsp;clever and successful satire on the Socialist state of the future.&nbsp;This has been translated into the EngHsh. He also wrote much on&nbsp;Prussian finance, and under the title </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Das politische A, B, C Buch&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">compiled a very useful political handbook for Radical voters.&nbsp;He also published in 1892 reminiscences of his youth </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Jugend-er inner ungen),</span><span class="font0"> and two volumes of pariiamentary reminiscences&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(lm alten Reichstag,</span><span class="font0"> 1894-1896).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He died at Jena on the 26th of January 1006.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RlCHTER, HANS (1843- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), Hungarian musical conductor,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">born at Raab on the 4th of April 1843, was the son of the kapellmeister at the cathedral, and of his wife, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">née</span><span class="font0"> Josephine&nbsp;Csazinsky, who was the first to perform Venus in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tannhäuser&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">at Vienna. Young Hans sang either soprano or alto in the&nbsp;cathedral choir, according to requirement, and OccasionaHy&nbsp;played the organ. But his public </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">debut</span><span class="font0"> was made as a drummer&nbsp;in Haydn’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paukenmesse.</span><span class="font0"> In 1853, at the age of ten, he appeared&nbsp;in a concert as pianist in Hummel’s E flat quintet; and in 1854,&nbsp;after his father’s death, went to the choristers’ school, the&nbsp;Convikt (where Schubert was educated) in Vienna, and there&nbsp;became chorister in the Court ChapeL For five years from i860&nbsp;Richter studied under Heissler and Sechter in the Vienna Conservatorium,and he learnt the horn under Kleinecke. A year and&nbsp;a half after his first lesson he became hornist in the old Karnth-nerthor Theatre at £3 a month. Meanwhile he had devoted&nbsp;time to conducting. It was not till August 1868 that Richter&nbsp;made his first appearance as a conductor, at the Hof Theater,&nbsp;Munich (where he had just been appointed), in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">William Tell,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">but in the next year Jie resigned this post, went first to Paris,&nbsp;then to Brussels, and finaUy to Triebschcn, where he copied&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Der Ring des Nibelungen</span><span class="font0"> for Wagner. In April 1871 Richter&nbsp;took up his new duties as conductor of the Hungarian National&nbsp;Opera at Budapest, where he remained four years, until he&nbsp;began in May 1875 his long connexion with the Vienna Opera,&nbsp;which terminated only with the century. In 1876 Richter</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
