<p><label>REIGATE</label>
a market town and municipal borough of Surrey, is situated at the head of the long valley of Holms-dale Hollow, on three railway lines, 23 miles south of London. It consists principally of one long street, with surrounding houses and villas inhabited chiefly by persons having their occupations in London. Of the old castle, supposed to have been built before the Conquest, to com</p><p>mand the pass through the valley, there only remains the entrance to a cave beneath, 150 feet long and from 10 to 12 feet high, excavated in the sand, which the barons used as a guardroom. The grounds have been laid out as a public garden. Near the market house is the site of an ancient chapel dedicated to Thomas h Becket. In the chancel of the parish church of St Mary, a building ranging from Transition Norman to Perpendicular, which dates from the beginning of the reign of Henry VII., were buried Archbishop Ussher and Lord Howard, the commander of the English navy against the Spanish Armada. Above the vestry there is a library containing some choice manuscripts and rare books. The grammar school was founded in 1675. Among the other public buildings are the town-hall, the public hall, the market-hall, and the working men’s institute. The town has some agricultural trade, and in the neighbourhood are quarries for freestone, hearthstone, and white sand. The area of the municipal borough is 6015 acres, with a population in 1871 of 15,916, and in 1881 of 18,662.</p><p>In Domesday the town was called “ Cliurchfelle,” or “ the church in the field, ” and afterwards it was called Churchfield in Reigate, the earlier reading of the latter name being “Ridgegate.” The castle was taken by Louis the Dauphin in the reign of John. In the time of the Confessor the manor belonged to his queen Edith. A market was granted by Edward III. The town returned two members to parliament from the reign of Edward I. to the reign of William IV., and one from 1832 to 1867, when it was disfranchised for corrupt practices.</p>
