<p><span class="font1">chief tales must suffice. Only a few of them have hitherto been published. They exist in numerous MSS. which testify to their&nbsp;great popularity; in the popular songs one finds many traces of&nbsp;their influence upon the people’s imagination. They include the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Adam and Eve,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Legend of the Cross, The Apocalypse&nbsp;of Abraham,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Sibyl,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Legends of Solomon;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">numerous New Testament apocryphal tales, starting with legends&nbsp;of St John the Baptist; a very remarkable version of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gospel&nbsp;of Nicodemus;</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epistle of PUate<sub>:</sub></span><span class="font1"> Printed in tens of&nbsp;thousands of copies are certain apocalyptic legends dealing with&nbsp;eschatological problems. The ancient </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apocalypse of Peter</span><span class="font1"> appears&nbsp;here under the name of Paul, then there is an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apocalypse of the&nbsp;Virgin Mary,</span><span class="font1"> who, like Peter, is carried by the Archangel through&nbsp;the torments of Hell and the bliss of Paradise, and through whose&nbsp;intervention sufferers are granted pardon on certain days of the&nbsp;year. Combined with these is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Epistle,</span><span class="font1"> sent from&nbsp;Heaven, enjoining strict observance, not only of Sunday, but also&nbsp;of Friday and Wednesday, as holy days. Most of these texts&nbsp;date in their Rumanian form from the 16th and 17th centuries;&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Epistle</span><span class="font1"> is well known in connexion with the Flagellants.&nbsp;In the same pamphlet as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sunday Epistle</span><span class="font1"> was published the&nbsp;legend of St Sisoe and sometimes that of Avcstitza,—the former&nbsp;saved the children of his sister from the attacks of the devil, who&nbsp;had devoured them and had to restore them alive; the latter is&nbsp;the female child-stealing demon, who is prevented by an angel&nbsp;from carrying out her evil design. In both cases the repetition&nbsp;of the legend and the recitation of a string of mystical names&nbsp;serve, like some other tales, apocryphal and otherwise, as amulets,&nbsp;sufficient to protect from the devil. Upon the recitation of some&nbsp;of these texts rest many popular charms and incantations. Therein&nbsp;lies the importance of this written literature, for it gives us the&nbsp;clue to much that now lives in the mouths of the people, and is&nbsp;by some considered to be of immemorial antiquity. A number&nbsp;of astrological calendars and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">prognostica</span><span class="font1"> are among the best known&nbsp;and most widely circulated popular books, and the lives of St&nbsp;Alexius, Xenophon, &amp;c. have become chapbooks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The whole of this popular literature belongs to what, may be called the cycle of the Balkan nations, in every one of which exact</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">C</span><span class="font1">arallels are to be found. Not that there was any direct, deliberate orrowing by one nation from the other, but all of them seem&nbsp;to have stood for a long time under identical psychological, influences and to have developed on similar lines. The superstitions&nbsp;of one arc often found to be those of the others, and in such a&nbsp;form that they could not have been taken over independently&nbsp;from a third source; they show too much family likeness. Thus&nbsp;also the popular songs of Rumania, the “ doine,” the “ hora,7 the&nbsp;” cäntece,” “ colinde,” “ legende,” i.e. the love songs, the heroic&nbsp;ballads, legends, songs at the ring-dance, hymns and carols, though&nbsp;instinct with a charm of their own, find their counterparts in&nbsp;many a song, ballad, &amp;c. of the Balkan nations. The heroes are&nbsp;often the same:_ Serbs, Bulgars and Rumanians sing the heroic&nbsp;deeds of Baba Novak and recite the legend of the 'Monastery of&nbsp;Argesh, or the ballad of Iorgovan, found in the Malorussian Byliny.&nbsp;One of the first to collect these treasures of Rumanian poetry was&nbsp;V. Alecsandri (1852-1866), who, however, retained only their poetical&nbsp;beauty and did not reproduce them with that strict accuracy&nbsp;which modern study of folklore demands. A. .M. Marienescu&nbsp;collected those of Transylvania (1859); S. F. Marian, those of the&nbsp;Bukovina (1873); T. T. Burada, those of the Dobrudja (1880);&nbsp;but the most complete collection is that of G. Dem. Teodorescu,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poesii populäre romdne</span><span class="font1"> (Bucharest, 1885). The collection of&nbsp;fairy tales started later than that of the ballads. The first collection is the German translation of tales heard by the Brothers&nbsp;Schott (1845). The most important collections, now deservedly&nbsp;considered as classical from every point of view, are the successive&nbsp;publications of P. Ispirescu. The collected tales of the Moldavian&nbsp;Ion Creanga (1837-89) appeared in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Opere complecte</span><span class="font1"> (1908). Excellent collections are those of D. Stancescu, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Basme</span><span class="font1"> (1885-1893),&nbsp;I. G. Sbiera, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Basme</span><span class="font1"> (1886), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fräncu Candrea</span><span class="font1"> (1888). Kutzo-VIach&nbsp;tales and folklore will be found in G. Weigand, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Aromunen,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">vol. ii. The only review devoted to the study of folklore is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">¡fazatoare,</span><span class="font1"> founded in 1892.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In recent times a kind of stagnation seems to have overtaken</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rumania, and although attempts have been made to place the intellectual life of the nation on a sounder basis, the work of transition from the past to the present has hitherto absorbed more energy&nbsp;than appears necessary. Whatever the causes may have been, the&nbsp;fact remains, that now there is a great dearth of talent and great&nbsp;poverty in output.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUM ELIA, or Roumelia (Turkish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rumili,</span><span class="font1"> “ the land of the Romans,” f.c. the East Roman or Byzantine empire), a&nbsp;name commonly used, from the 15th century onwards, to denote&nbsp;that part of the Balkan Peninsula which was subject to Turkey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">More precisely it was the country bounded N. by Bulgaria, W. by Albania and S. by the Morea, or in other words the&nbsp;ancient provinces, including Constantinople and Salonica, of&nbsp;Thrace and Macedonia. The name was ultimately applied more&nbsp;especially to a province composed of central Albania and western&nbsp;Macedonia, having Monastir for its chief town. Owing to&nbsp;administrative changes effected between 1870 and 1875, the&nbsp;name ceased to correspond with any political division. Eastern&nbsp;Rumelia was constituted an autonomous province of the&nbsp;Turkish empire by the Berlin treaty of 1878; but on the 18th&nbsp;of September 1885, after a bloodless revolution, it was united&nbsp;with Bulgaria </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RUMFORD, BENJAMIN THOMPSON, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Count (1753-1814), British-American man of science, philanthropist and administrator, was born at Woburn, in Massachusetts, on the 26th of&nbsp;March 1753. The Thompson family had been settled in New&nbsp;England since the middle of the previous century, and belonged&nbsp;to the class of moderately wealthy farmers. His father died&nbsp;while he was very young, and his mother speedily married a second&nbsp;time. But he seems to' have been well cared for, and he was at&nbsp;the age of fourteen sufficiently advanced “ in algebra, geometry,&nbsp;astronomy, and even the higher mathematics,” to calculate a&nbsp;solar eclipse within four seconds of accuracy. In 1766 he was&nbsp;apprenticed to a storekeeper at Salem, in New England, and&nbsp;while in that employment occupied himself in chemical and&nbsp;mechanical experiments, as well as in engraving, in which he&nbsp;attained to some proficiency. The outbreak of the American&nbsp;War put a stop to the trade of his master, and he thereupon&nbsp;left Salem and went to - Boston, where he engaged himself as&nbsp;assistant in another store. He was at that * period between&nbsp;seventeen and eighteen years old, and at nineteen, he says, </span><span class="font1"><sup>a</sup> I&nbsp;married, or rather I was married.” His wife was the widow of&nbsp;Colonel Benjamin Rolfe, and the daughter of Timothy Walker,&nbsp;“ a highly respectable minister, and one of the first settlers at&nbsp;Rumford,” now called Concord, in New Hampshire. His wife&nbsp;was possessed of considerable property, and was his senior by&nbsp;fourteen years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This marriage was the foundation of his success. Soon after it he became acquainted with Governor Wentworth of New&nbsp;Hampshire, who conferred on him the majority of a local&nbsp;regiment of militia. He speedily became the object of distrust&nbsp;among the friends of the American cause, and it was considered&nbsp;prudent that he should seek an early opportunity of leaving&nbsp;the country. On the evacuation of Boston by the royal troops,&nbsp;therefore, in 1776, he was selected by Governor Wentworth&nbsp;to carry despatches to England. On his arrival in London&nbsp;Lord George Germain, secretary of state, appointed him to a&nbsp;clerkship in his office. Within a few months he was advanced&nbsp;to the post of secretary of the province of Georgia, and in about&nbsp;four years he was made under-secretary of state. His official&nbsp;duties, however, did not interfere with the prosecution of&nbsp;scientific pursuits, and in 1779 he was elected a fellow of the&nbsp;Royal Society. Among the subjects to which he especially&nbsp;directed his attention were the explosive force of gunpowder,&nbsp;the construction of firearms, and a system of signalling at&nbsp;sea. In connexion with the last, he made a cruise in the&nbsp;Channel fleet, on board the “ Victory,” as a volunteer under the&nbsp;command of Admiral Sir Charles Hardy. On the resignation of&nbsp;Lord North’s administration, of which Lord George Germain&nbsp;was one of the least popular members, he left the civil service,&nbsp;and was nominated to a cavalry command in the revolted&nbsp;provinces of America. But the War of Independence was&nbsp;practically at an end, and in 1783 he finally quitted active&nbsp;service, with the rank and half-pay of a lieutenant-colonel. He&nbsp;now formed the design of joining the Austrian army, for the&nbsp;purpose of campaigning against the Turks, and so crossed over&nbsp;from Dover to Calais with Gibbon, who, writing to his friend&nbsp;Lord Sheffield, calls his fellow-passenger “ Mr Secrctary-Colonel-Admiral-Philosopher Thompson.” At Strassburg he&nbsp;was introduced to Prince Maximilian, afterwards elector of&nbsp;Bavaria, and was by him invited to enter the civil and military&nbsp;service of that state.
