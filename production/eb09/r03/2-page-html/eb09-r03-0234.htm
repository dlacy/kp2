<p><span class="font1">RÜCKERT, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Friedrich</span><span class="font1"> (1788-1866), an eminent German poet, was born at Schweinfurt on the 16th May&nbsp;1788. He was educated at the gymnasium of his native&nbsp;place and at the universities of Würzburg and Heidelberg,&nbsp;where he studied law and philology. Having taken his&nbsp;degree, he went to the university of Jena as a “ privat-docent”; but this position he soon abandoned. For some&nbsp;time he worked in connexion with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morgenblatt</span><span class="font1"> at&nbsp;Stuttgart. Nearly the whole of the year 1818 he spent&nbsp;in Rome, where he devoted himself to study, especially to&nbsp;the study of the popular poetry of Italy ; and afterwards&nbsp;he lived for several years at Coburg. He was appointed&nbsp;a professor of Oriental languages at the university of&nbsp;Erlangen in 1826, and in 1841 he was called to a similar&nbsp;position in Berlin, where he was also made a privy councillor.&nbsp;In 1849 he resigned his professorship at Berlin, and went&nbsp;to live on his estate near Coburg. He died on the 31st&nbsp;January 1866. When Riickert began his literary career,&nbsp;Germany was engaged in her life-and-death struggle with&nbsp;Napoleon ; and in his first volume, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Deutsche Gedichte,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">published in 1814 under the name of Freimund Raimar,&nbsp;he gave vigorous expression to the prevailing sentiment of&nbsp;his countrymen. In 1816 appeared </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Napoleon, eine politische&nbsp;Komodie in drei Stücken,</span><span class="font1"> and in 1817 the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kranz der Zeit.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">He issued a collection of poems, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oestliche Rosen,</span><span class="font1"> in 1822 ;&nbsp;and in 1834-38 his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gesammelte Gedichte</span><span class="font1"> were published in&nbsp;six volumes, a selection from which has passed through&nbsp;many editions. Riickert, who was master of thirty languages, made his mark chiefly as a translator of Oriental&nbsp;poetry, and as a writer of poems conceived in the spirit of&nbsp;Oriental masters. Much attention was attracted by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die&nbsp;Verwandlungen des Abu Seid,</span><span class="font1"> a translation of Hariri’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Makamen</span><span class="font1"> (1826), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nal und Damajanti,</span><span class="font1"> an Indian tale&nbsp;(1828), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amrilkais, der Dichter und König</span><span class="font1"> (1843), and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hamasa, oder die ältesten arabischen Volkslieder</span><span class="font1"> (1846).&nbsp;Among his original poems dealing with Oriental subjects&nbsp;are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morgenlandische Sagen und Geschichten</span><span class="font1"> (1837), </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erbauliches und Beschauliches aus dem Morgenland</span><span class="font1"> (1836-38),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rostem und Suhrab, eine Heldengeschidite</span><span class="font1"> (1838), and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brahinanische Erzählungen</span><span class="font1"> (1839). The most elaborate&nbsp;of his works is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Die Weisheit des Brahmanen,</span><span class="font1"> published in&nbsp;six volumes in 1836-39. In 1843-45 he issued several&nbsp;dramas, all of which are greatly inferior to the work to&nbsp;which he owes his distinctive place in German literature.&nbsp;At the time of the Danish war in 1864 he wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ein&nbsp;Dutzend Kampf-Lieder für Schlesurig-Holstein,</span><span class="font1"> which, although published anonymously, produced a considerable&nbsp;impression. After his death many poetical translations&nbsp;and original poems were found among his papers, and&nbsp;several collections of them were published. Rückert&nbsp;lacked the simple and natural feeling which is characteristic of all the greatest lyrical poets of Germany. But&nbsp;he had a certain splendour of imagination which made&nbsp;Oriental poetry congenial to him, and he has seldom been&nbsp;surpassed in his power of giving rhythmic expression to&nbsp;ideas on the conduct of life. As a master of poetical&nbsp;style he ranks with German writers of the highest class.&nbsp;There are hardly any lyrical forms which are not represented&nbsp;among his works, and in all of them, the simplest and the&nbsp;most complex, he wrote with equal ease and grace.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RÙDAGÎ (d. 954). Hakim Mohammed Farid-eddin 'Abdallfih, the first great genius of modern Persia, was&nbsp;born in Rùdag, a village in Transoxiana, about 870-900,&nbsp;—totally blind, as most of his biographers assert, although&nbsp;the fine distinction of colours and the minute description&nbsp;of the various tints and shades of flowers in his poems&nbsp;flatly contradict the customary legend of the “ blind minstrel.” In his eighth year he knew the whole Korfin by&nbsp;heart and had begun to write verses. He had besides a&nbsp;wonderful voice which enraptured all hearers, and he played&nbsp;in a masterly way on the lute. The fame of these accomplishments at last reached the ear of the Sfimfinid Nasr II.&nbsp;bin Ahmad, the ruler of Khorâsân and Transoxiana (913—&nbsp;942), who drew the poet to his court and distinguished&nbsp;him by his personal favour. Riidagi became his daily&nbsp;companion, rose to the highest honours, and grew rich in&nbsp;worldly wealth. He received so many costly presents that&nbsp;he could allow himself the extravagance of keeping two&nbsp;hundred pages, and that four hundred camels were necessary to carry all his property. In spite of various predecessors he well deserves the title of “ father of Persian&nbsp;literature,” since he was the first who impressed upon every&nbsp;form of epic, lyric, and didactic poetry its peculiar stamp&nbsp;and its individual character. He is also said to have been&nbsp;the founder of the “ diwfin,” that is, the typical form of&nbsp;the complete collection of a poet’s lyrical compositions in&nbsp;a more or less alphabetical order which prevails to the&nbsp;present day among all Mohammedan writers. His poems&nbsp;filled, according to all statements, one hundred volumes and&nbsp;consisted of one million three hundred thousand verses ;&nbsp;but of this there remain only fifty-two kasidas, ghazals,&nbsp;and rubfi'is ; of his epic masterpieces we have nothing&nbsp;beyond a few stray lines found here and there as illustrations of ancient Persian words and phrases in native&nbsp;dictionaries. But the most serious loss is that of his&nbsp;translation of Ibn Mukaffa’s Arabic version of the old&nbsp;Indian fable book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kalilah and Dimnah,</span><span class="font1"> which he put&nbsp;into Persian verse at the request of his royal patron, and&nbsp;for which he received the handsome reward of 40,000&nbsp;dirhems. In his kasidas, which are all devoted to the&nbsp;praise of his sovereign and friend, Rfidagi has left us&nbsp;unequalled models of a refined and delicate taste, very&nbsp;different from the often bombastic compositions of later&nbsp;Persian encomiasts, and these alone would entitle him to&nbsp;a foremost rank among the poets of his country ; but his&nbsp;renown is considerably enhanced by his odes and epigrams. Those of a didactic tendency express in well-measured lines a sort of Epicurean philosophy—in the&nbsp;loftiest sense of the word—on human life and human&nbsp;happiness; more charming still are the purely lyrical pieces,&nbsp;sweet and fascinating songs, which glorify the two everlasting delights of glowing hearts and cheerful minds—love&nbsp;and wine. Rfidagi survived his royal friend, and died&nbsp;long after the splendid days of Nasr’s patronage, the time&nbsp;of wealth and luxury, had passed away—poor and forgotten&nbsp;by the world, as one of his poems, a beautiful elegy,&nbsp;seems to indicate—in 954.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A complete edition of all the extant poems of Rfidagi, in Persian text and metrical German translation, together with a biographical account, based on forty-six Persian MSS., is found in Dr Ethé’s&nbsp;“ Rfidagi der Samanidendichter </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">” .GFottvnger Nachrichten,</span><span class="font0"> 1873, pp.&nbsp;663-742).</span></p>
