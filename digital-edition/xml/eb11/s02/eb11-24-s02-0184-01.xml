S.E. of Los Angeles. Pop. (1900) 4933 (506 foreign-born); (1910) 8429. It is served by the Atchison, Topeka &amp;amp; Santa Fé, the Southern Pacific and the Pacific Electric railways. The city is situated about 10 m. from the ocean, in the lower western foothills of the Santa Ana moun-tains. There are numerous artesian wells in the surrounding region, and there is a good irrigation system. (For a description of the irrigation canal see Aqueduct.) Santa Ana is in the orange, lemon and walnut region of southern California, and in the only important celery-growing district of the state; the celery is grown in great quantities in the large district known as the “ Peatlands ” (about 9 m. from the city), which is underlaid by a deposit of peat from 1 to 100 ft. deep. Other important products of the county are petroleum, barley, sugar beets, apricots and lima beans. Santa Ana was first platted in 1869 and was incorporated in 1888. Its growth since 1900 has been rapid.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
