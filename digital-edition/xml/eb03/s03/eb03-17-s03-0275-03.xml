according to Lord Karnes, is a term appropriated to ſuch thoughts as are prompted by paſſion. It differs from a perception ; for a perception ſigniſies the add by which we become conscious of external objects. It differs from conſciouſnefs of an internal action, ſuch as thinking, ſuſpending thought, inclining, reſolving, willing, &amp;c. And it differs from the conception of a relation among objects ; a conception of that kind being termed <hi rend="italic">opinion.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sentiments,</hi> in poetry. To talk in the language of muſic, each paſſion hath a certain tone, to which every ſentiment proceeding from it ought to be tuned with the greateſt accuracy : which is no eaſy work, eſpecially where ſuch harmony ought to be ſupported during the courſe of a long theatrical repreſentation. In order to reach ſuch delicacy of execution, it is neceſſary that a writer aſſume the preciſe character and paſſion of the personage repreſented ; which requires an uncommon genius. But it is the only difficulty ; for the writer, who, annihilating himſelf, can thus become another perſon, need be in no pain about the ſentiments that belong to the aſſumed character : theſe will flow without the leaſt ſtudy, or even preconception ; and will frequently be as delightfully new to himſelſ as to his reader. But if a lively picture even of a ſingle emotion require an effort of genius, how much greater the effort to compoſe a passionate dialogue with as many different tones of paſſion as there are ſpeakers ? With what ductility of feeling muſt that writer be endued, who approaches perfection in ſuch a work ; when it is neceſſary to aſſume different and even oppoſite characters and paſſions in the quickeſt ſucceſſion ? Yet this work, difficult as it is, yields to that of compoſing a dialogue in genteel comedy, exhibiting characters without paſſion. The reason is, that the different tones of character are more delicate, and leſs in fight, than thoſe of paſſion ; and, accordingly, many writers, who have no genius for drawing characters, make a ſhift to represent, tolerably well, an ordinary paſſion in its ſimple movements. But of all works of this kind, what is truly the moſt difficult, is a characteriſtical dialogue upon any philofophical ſubject ; to interweave characters with reaſoning, by ſuiting to the character of each ſpeaker a peculiarity not only of thought but of expreſſion, requires the perfection of genius, taſte, and judgment.</p><p>How difficult dialogue-writing is, will be evident, even without reaſoning, from the miſerable compoſitions of that kind found without number in all languages. The art of mimicking any ſingularity in geſture or in voice, is a rare talent, though directed by sight and hearing, the acuteſt and moſt lively of our external ſenſes : how much more rare muſt that talent be, of imitating characters and internal emotions, tracing all their different tints, and repreſenting them in a lively manner by natural ſentiments properly expressed ? The truth is, ſuch execution is too delicate for an ordinary genius; and for that reason the bulk of writers, inſtead of expressing a paſſion as one does who feels it, content themſelves with deſcribing it in the language of a ſpectator. To awake passion by an internal effort merely, without any external cauſe, requires great ſenſibility ; and yet that operation is necessary, not leſs to the writer than to the actor ; becauſe none but thoſe who actually feel a paſſion can repreſent it to the life. The writer’s part is the more complicated : he muſt add compoſition to paſſion : and muſt, in the quickeſt ſucceſſion, adopt every different character. But a very humble flight of imagination may ſerve to convert a<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0282.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0276"/>
writer into a ſpectator, ſo as to figure, in some obſcure manner, an action as paſſing in his sight and hearing. In that figured ſituation, being led naturally to write like a ſpectator, he entertains his readers with his own reflections, with cool deſcription, and florid declamation ; inſtead of making them eye-witneſſes, as it were, to a real event, and to every movement of genuine paſſion. Thus moſt of our plays appear to be cast in the same mould ; perſonages without character, the mere outlines of paſſion, a tireſome monotony, and a pompous declamatory ſtyle.</p><p>This deſcriptive manner of repreſenting paſſion is a very cold entertainment ; our ſympathy is not raiſed by deſcription ;. we muſt firſt be lulled into a dream of reality, and every thing muſt appear as paſſing in our light. Unhappy is the player of genius who acts a part in what may be termed a <hi rend="italic">deſcriptive tragedy ;</hi> after aſſuming the very paſſion that is to be repreſented, how is he cramped in action, when he muſt utter, not the ſentiments of the paſſion he feels, but a cold deſcription in the language of a byſtander ? It is that imperfection, undoubtedly, in the bulk of our plays, which confines our ſtage almoſt entirely to Shakeſpeare, notwithſtanding his many irregularities. In our late Engliſh tragedies, we ſometimes find ſentiments tolerably well adapted to a plain paſſion : but we muſt not in any of them expect a ſentiment expreſſive of character ; and, upon that very account, our late performances of the dramatic kind are for the moſt part intolerably inſipid.</p><p>But it may be proper to illuſtrate this ſubject by examples. The firſt examples ſhall be of ſentiments that appear the legitimate offspring of paſſion ; to which ſhall be oppoſed what are deſcriptive only, and illegitimate : and in making this compariſon, the inſtances ſhall be borrowed from <bibl> Shakeſpeare </bibl> and <bibl> Corneille </bibl> , who for genius in dramatic compoſition ſtand uppermoſt in the rolls of fame.</p><p>I. <bibl> Shakeſpeare </bibl> ſhall furniſh the firſt example, being of ſentiments dictated by a violent and perturbed paſſion :</p><sp> <speaker> Lear. </speaker> <l> —Filial ingratitude! </l> <l> Is it not as if this mouth ſhould tear this hand </l> <l> For lifting food toſt ?—But I’ll puniſh home ; </l> <l> No, I will weep no more.—In ſuch a night, </l> <l> To ſhut me out !—Pour on, I will endure. </l> <l> In ſuch a night as this ! O Regan, Gonerill, </l> <l> Your old kind father, whoſe frank heart gave all— </l> <l> O ! that way madneſs lies ; let me ſhun that ; </l> <l> No more of that.— </l> </sp> <sp> <speaker> Kent. </speaker> <l> Good, my lord, enter here. </l> </sp> <sp> <speaker> Lear. </speaker> <l> Prithee, go in thyſelf, ſeek thine own eaſe, </l> <l> This tempeſt will not give me leave to ponder </l> <l> On things would hurt me more : —but I’ll go in ; </l> <l> In, boy, go firſt. You houſeleſs poverty— </l> <l> Nay, get thee in ; I’ll pray, and then I’ll ſleep— </l> <l> Poor naked wretches, whereſoe’er you are, </l> <l> That bide the pelting of this pitileſs ſtorm ! </l> <l> How ſhall your houſeleſs heads, and unfed ſides, </l> <l> Your loop’d and window’d raggedneſs defend you </l> <l> From ſeaſons ſuch as theſe !—Ο I have ta’en </l> <l> Too little care of this ! take phyſic, Pomp ; </l> <l> Expoſe thyſelf to feel what wretches feel, </l> <l> That thou may’ſt ſhake the ſuperflux to them, </l> <l> And ſhow the heav’ns more juft. </l> </sp> <bibl> King Lear , act 3. sc. 5. </bibl><p>With regard to the French author, truth obliges us to acknowledge, that he deſcribes in the ſtyle of a ſpectator, inſtead of expreſſing paſſion like one who feels it ; which naturally betrays him into a tireſome monotony, and a pompous declamatory ſtyle. It is ſcarce neceſſary to give examples, for he never varies from that tone. We ſhall, however, take two paſſages at a venture, in order to be confronted with thoſe tranſcribed above. In the tragedy of <bibl> Cinna </bibl> , alter the conspiracy was diſcovered, Æmilia, having nothing in view but racks and death to herſelf and her lover, receives a pardon from Auguſtus, attended with the brighteſt circumſtances of magnanimity and tenderneſs. This is a lucky ſituation for repreſenting the paſſions of surpriſe and gratitude in their different ſtages, which ſeem naturally to be what follow. Theſe paſſions, raiſed at once to the utmoſt pitch, and being at firſt too big for utterance, muſt, for ſome moments, be expreſſed by violent geſtures only : ſo ſoon as there is vent for words, the firſt expreſſions are broken and interrupted : at laſt, we ought to expect a tide of intermingled ſentiments, occaſioned by the fluctuation of the mind between the two paſſions. Æmilia is made to behave in a very different manner : with extreme coolness ſhe deſcribes her own ſituation, as if ſhe were merely a ſpectator ; or rather the poet takes the taſk off her hands:</p><sp> <l> Et je me rends, Seigneur, à ces hautes bontés : </l> <l> Je recouvre la vûe auprès de leurs clartés. </l> <l> Je connois mon forfait qui me sembloit juſtice ; </l> <l> Et ce que n’avoit pû la terreur du supplice, </l> <l> Je fens naître en mon ame un repentir puissant, </l> <l> Et mon cœur en secret me dit, qu’il y consent. </l> <l> Le ciel a resolu votre grandeur suprême ; </l> <l> Et pour preuve, Seigneur, je n’en veux que moi-même. </l> <l> J’ose avec vanité me donner cet éclat, </l> <l> Puisqu’il change mon cœur, qu’il veut changer l’état. </l> <l> Ma haine va mourir, que j’ai crue immortelle; </l> <l> Elle est morte, et ce cœur devient sujet fidele ; </l> <l> Et prenant déformais cette haine en horreur, </l> <l> L’ardeur de vous servir succede à sa fureur. </l> </sp> <bibl> Act 5. sc. 3 </bibl><p>So much in general upon the genuine ſentiments of paſſion. We proceed to particular obſervations. And, firſt, paſſions ſeldom continue uniform any conſiderable time : they generally fluctuate, ſwelling and ſubſiding by turns, often in a quick ſucceſſion ; and the ſentiments cannot be juſt unleſs they correſpond to ſuch fluctuation. Accordingly, a climax never ſhows better than in expreſſing a ſwelling paſſion : the following paſſages may ſuffice for an illuſtration.</p><sp> <speaker> Almeria. </speaker> <l> —How haſt thou charm’d </l> <l> The wildneſs of the waves and rocks to this ; </l> <l> That thus relenting they have giv’n thee back </l> <l> To earth, to light and life, to love and me ? </l> </sp> <bibl> Mourning Bride , act 1. ſc. 7. </bibl> <sp> <l> I would not be the villain that thou think’ſt </l> <l> For the whole ſpace that’s in the tyrant’s graſp, </l> <l> And the rich earth to boot. </l> </sp> <bibl> Macbeth , act 4. ſc. 4. </bibl>
<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0283.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0277"/>
<p>The following paſſage expreſſes finely the progreſs of conviction.</p><sp> <l> Let me not ſtir, nor breathe, lest I diſſolve </l> <l> That tender, lovely form, of painted air, </l> <l> So like Almeria. Ha ! it sinks, it falls ; </l> <l> I’ll catch it e’er it goes, and graſp her ſhade. </l> <l> ’Tis life ! ’tis warm ! ’tis ſhe ! ’tis ſhe herſelf ! </l> <l> It is Almeria ! ’tis, it is my wife ! </l> </sp> <bibl> Mourning Bride , act 2. ſc. 6. </bibl><p>In the progreſs of thought our reſolutions become more vigorous as well as our paſſions.</p><sp> <l> If ever I do yield or give conſent, </l> <l> By any action, word, or thought, to wed </l> <l> Another lord; may then just heav’n ſhow’r down, amp;c. </l> </sp> <bibl> Mourning Bride , act 1. ſc. 1. </bibl><p>And this leads to a ſecond obſervation, That the different ſtages of a paſſion, and its different directions, from birth to extinction, muſt be carefully repreſented in their order ; becauſe otherwise the ſentiments, by being misplaced, will appear forced and unnatural. — Reſentment, for example, when provoked by an atrocious injury, diſcharges itſelf ſirſt upon the author : ſentiments therefore of revenge come always ſirſt, and muſt in ſome meaſure be exhauſted before the perſon injured think of grieving for himſelf. In the Cid of Corneille, Don Diegue having been affronted in a cruel manner, expreſſes ſcarce any ſentiment of revenge, but is totally occupied in contemplating the low ſituation to which he is reduced by the affront :</p><sp> <l> O rage ! ô deſeſpoir ! ô vieilleſſe ennemie ! </l> <l> N’ai-je donc tant vecu que pour cette infamie? </l> <l> Et ne suis-je blanchi dans les travaux guerriers, </l> <l> Que pour voir en un jour fletrir tant de lauriers ? </l> <l> Mon bras, qu’avec respect tout l’Espagne admire, </l> <l> Mon bras qui tant de fois a fauve cet empire, </l> <l> Tant de fois affermi le trône de son roi, </l> <l> Trahit donc ma querelle, et ne fait rien pour moi ! </l> <l> O cruel souvenir de ma gloire passé ! </l> <l> Oeuvre de tant de jours en un jour effacée ! </l> <l> Nouvelle dignité fatale a mon bonheur ! </l> <l> Precipice élevé d’où tombe mon honneur ! </l> <l> Faut-il de votre éclat voir triompher le comte, </l> <l> Et mourir fans vengeance, ou vivre dans la honte ? Comte, fois de mon prince à present gouverneur, </l> <l> Ce haut rang n’admet point un homme fans honneur ; Et ton jaloux orgueil par cet affront insigne, </l> <l> Malgré le choix du roi, m’en a sû rendre indigne. </l> <l> Et toi, de mes exploits glorieux instrument, </l> <l> Mais d’un corps tout de glace inutile ornement, </l> <l> Fer jadis tant à craindre, et qui dans cette offense, </l> <l> M ’as fervi de parade, et non pas de defense, </l> <l> Va, quitte déformais le dernier des humains, </l> <l> Paffe pour me venger en de meilleures mains. </l> </sp> <bibl> Le Cid , act 1. ſc. 7. </bibl><p>Theſe ſentiments are certainly not the firſt that are ſuggeſted by the paſſion of reſentment. As the firſt movements of reſentment are always directed to its object, the very ſame is the caſe of grief. Yet with relation to the hidden and ſevere diſtemper that ſeized Alexander bathing in the river Cydnus, Quintus Curtius deſcribes the firſt emotions of the army as directed to themſelves, lamenting that they were left without a leader, far. from home, and had ſcarce any hopes of returning in ſafety : their king’s diſtreſs, which muſt naturally have been their firſt concern, occupies them but in the ſecond place according to that author. In the Aminta of Taſſo, Sylvia, upon a report of her lover’s death, which ſhe believed certain, inſtead of bemoaning the loss of her beloved, turns her thoughts upon herself, and wonders her heart does not break :</p><sp> <l> Ohime, ben ſon di ſaſſo, </l> <l> Poi che queſta novella non m’uccide. </l> </sp> <bibl> Act. 4. ſc. 2. </bibl><p>In the tragedy of Jane Shore, Alicia, in the full purpoſe of deſtroying her rival, has the following reflection:</p><sp> <l> Oh Jealouſy ! thou bane of pleaſing friendſhip, </l> <l> Thou worſt invader of our tender boſoms ; </l> <l> How does thy rancour poiſon all our ſoftneſs, </l> <l> And turn our gentle nature into bitterneſs ! </l> <l> See where ſhe comes ! Once my heart’s deareſt bleſſing, </l> <l> Now my chang’d eyes are blaſted with her beauty, </l> <l> Loathe that known face, and sicken to behold her. </l> </sp> <bibl> Act 3. sc. 1. </bibl><p>Theſe are the reflections of a cool ſpectator. A paſſion, while it has the aſcendant, and is freely indulged, suggeſts not to the person who feels it any ſentiment to its own prejudice : reflections like the foregoing occur not readily till the paſſion has ſpent its vigour.</p><p>A perſon ſometimes is agitated at once by different paſſions ; and the mind in that caſe, vibrating like a pendulum, vents itſelf in ſentiments that partake of the ſame vibration. This we give as a third obſervation:</p><sp> <speaker> Queen. </speaker> <l> Would I had never trod this Engliſh earth, </l> <l> Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it ! </l> <l> Ye’ve angels faces, but heav’n knows your hearts. </l> <l> What ſhall become of me now ? wretched lady ! </l> <l> I am the moſt unhappy woman living. </l> <l> Alas ! poor wenches, where are now your fortunes ? </l> <stage> [To her women. </stage> <l> Shipwreck’d upon a kingdom, where no pity, </l> <l> No friends, no hope, no kindred, weep for me ?. </l> <l> Almoſt no grave allow’d me. </l> </sp> <bibl> Henry VIII . act 3. sc. 1. </bibl> <sp> <speaker> Othello. </speaker> <l> Oh devil, devil ! </l> <l> If that the earth could teem with woman’s tears, </l> <l> Each drop ſhe falls would prove a crocodile. </l> <l> Out of my ſight ! </l> </sp> <sp> <speaker> Desdemona. </speaker> <l> I will not ſtay t’offend you. <stage> [Going. </stage> </l> </sp> <sp> <speaker> Lodovico. </speaker> <l> Truly, an obedient lady: </l> <l> I do beseech your lordſhip, call her back. </l> </sp> <sp> <speaker> Oth. </speaker> <l> Miſtress- </l> </sp> <sp> <speaker> Des. </speaker> <l> My lord. </l> </sp> <sp> <speaker> Oth. </speaker> <l> What would you with her, Sir ? </l> </sp> <sp> <speaker> Lod. </speaker> <l> Who, I, my lord ? </l> </sp> <sp> <speaker> Oth. </speaker> <l> Ay; you did wiſh that I would make her turn. </l> <l> Sir, ſhe can turn and turn, and yet go on ; </l> <l> And turn again.
