inches thick ; these are also of American pine, and are 'bolted to the cross ties with screw bolts and washers, the heads of which are countersunk into the longitudinal timbers.
The entire transverse section is horizontal where the railway is straight, and inclined according to the radius in curves; and when the whole is bolted together, it forms what is in fact a road at fifteen-feet bearings. The line is then ballasted, and the longitudinal bearings are packed in the usual manner with fine sand or gravel, till they are raised in the middle from ahalftoone-third of an inch; Rleyarethenplaned to a uniform surface, and a plank ofelm, oak, or ash, 1 ½ inches thick, and 8 inches broad, is laid on them, with a copious intervening bed of tar, and nailed down ; the heads of the nails being punched in, to allow the plank to be planed ; the upper surface of the plank slopes inwards 1 in 20.
The rails are screwed down to the plank and longitudinal bearer,after the former has beenplaned; withfeltunderneath them. The whole of the timber is kyanized, and the joints, butts, bolts, washers, keys, spikes, and nails, also the whole of the longitudinal bearers, are tarred. In fixing the rails, square· headed screws are used outside the rails, and countersunk ones inside, to be clear of the flange of the wheels ; the outside screw is first completely tightened and then the inner one, a roller weighing about 10 tons being previously drawn several times along the rail, and followed up closely by the screwing.
The principle on which the railway is intended to be constructed chiefly consists in the piles being a constant retaining power, holding the road down against the packing, which would otherwise force it up ; so that this latter can be driven much harder in than by the ordinary mode. Mr. Brunel is said to calculate that he throws an upward pressure against the base of each longitundinal timber, equal to one ton per foot forward, or about one ton per square foot. He thus obtains 3 tons for every 3 feet length of rail, while a Stoneblock containing 4cubicfeet, only weighsaboutaquarter of a ton, which is therefore the pressure with each 3 feet of rail laid in the usual way ; neglecting the impact with which the stone block is forced into its seat by the cuddy and lever, a very uncertain quantity, but which perhaps never amounts to, on the whole, less than as 3 : 2 in favour of the longitudinal bearings. The timber used in a mile of this railway, is about 420 loads of pine, and 40 loads of hard-wood ; these require 6 tons of iron bolts, and 30,000 wood screws. The rails are about 44 lbs. per yard, and the cost of the first portion, laid from London to Maidenhead, including laying, ballasting, sidings, draining, and all other work, is stated at L∙9200 per mile.
Such is the mode of construction on this railroad, which has so much agitated the minds, not only of the shareholders, but of the whole railway public. This, however, ought not to have been the case, for the matter lies in a very small compass, and a short experiment should have determined it ; it is merely a question of expense. The first outlay must, of course, be great, and it is only necessary to know whether the future saving will be commensurate with it. A desire for a greater width of guage seems now gradually gainingground among those best entitled to judge on the subject, and the public will not long rest satisfied with a velocity of twenty miles an hour. Whether Mr. Brunel has taken the right measures to compass these desirable objects, will require much more room to discuss than we have here ; but this we know, that the Great Western, for the twenty-three miles now open to the public, is by far the smoothest and easiest line we have ever travelled on.
The relative ratio between the motion of the wheels and that of the piston will be much more advantageous at a given velocity as the wheels are large, within certain limits ; the greater degree of stability acquired, from the increased width of guage is also desirable, if not carried too far ; but we must confess we should ourselves be afraid of jumping from 4 feet 8½ inches, to 7 feet, without more experience. Another company jumped from 2 feet 9 inches to 5 feet in then-length of bearing, and the result was sufficiently inauspicious.
The effect of the diameter of the wheels on the velocity of the piston, may be thus computed :
Let e= the velocity of the wheels,

p=
the velocity of the piston,    > in feet,
Z= twice the length of the stroke, j m= the number of miles per hour the engine travels.
