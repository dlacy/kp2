<p><span class="font0">The Chelydidæ thus predominate to the exclusion of the Emydidæ. They belong to five distinct genera, of which one,&nbsp;Chxlys, is the most specialized of the family. They do not extend&nbsp;to the western side of the Andes, and cease in the south with the&nbsp;system of the Plate River. Northwards they penetrate to Trinidad,&nbsp;but become scarcer in the degree in which their place is occupied&nbsp;by the Emydidæ, which have spread from Central America over&nbsp;the northern parts of this region. One, Emys d<sup>,</sup>orbignii, following&nbsp;the course of the Uruguay, has penetrated southwards to the mouth&nbsp;of the Plate River.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Land Tortoises (Testudd) are at the present day almost extinct in this region, two species only (Τestudo tabulata or earbonaria&nbsp;and T. argentina) being found on the continent of South America.&nbsp;The six other species belong to the Oceanic Island Tortoises of&nbsp;gigantic size, and inhabit or inhabited the Galapagos group.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Trionyx is entirely absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Crocodilian order is more developed in this region than in any other. Besides at least three species of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Crocοdidus,</span><span class="font1"> six Alligators occur. The former occupy&nbsp;Central America, with Mexico, the coast of Florida, the&nbsp;West Indies, Ecuador, and the system of the Orinoco ;&nbsp;the latter extend much farther southwards, throughout&nbsp;the system of the Plate River, whilst in North America&nbsp;this genus is represented by a distinct species, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A. missis-sippensis.</span><span class="font0">@@<sup>1</sup></span><span class="font1"> Alligators found in some of the West Indian&nbsp;islands are believed to be immigrants from the continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Lacertilian fauna connects Central with South America,—all the six families found in the latter area,&nbsp;viz., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Geckonidæ, Anguidæ, Ampldsbænidæ, Tejifilæ, Igua-nidæ,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Seincidæ,</span><span class="font1"> being represented in Central America.&nbsp;But Central America possesses, besides, five other families,&nbsp;small in species and restricted in range (some belonging&nbsp;to the fauna of great elevations), but highly interesting&nbsp;types. These are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Eublepharidæ, Xenosauridæ, Aniel-lidæ, Helodermatidæ,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepidophymatidæ.</span><span class="font1"> Their localization and differentiation can be accounted for on the&nbsp;hypothesis that they are the remains of the fauna of the&nbsp;various islands into which Central America was broken&nbsp;up at a former period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By far the larger number of Lizards of the Tropical American region are Iguawidæ, a family which in the New World repeats the&nbsp;Old-World Agamidæ. They are spread over the whole of the&nbsp;region, having adapted themselves in their mode of life and&nbsp;structure to every variety of ground. One species (Liolæmus&nbsp;magellanicus) ranges to the Straits of Magellan. The largest&nbsp;Iguanoids inhabit the Galapagos Islands, where they live on the&nbsp;rocks of the shore, one species (Oreocephαlus cristatus) entering seawater and feeding on sea-weeds. The next numerous family is&nbsp;the Tejidæ, the New-World representatives of the Old-World&nbsp;Laxertidæ·, Ceekonidæ, Seincidæ, Amphisbæuidæ, and Anguidæ are&nbsp;less numerous, but have also a wide range over the region. The&nbsp;Lacertilian fauna of the West Indies is wholly South-American ;&nbsp;it does not comprise any peculiar family, and only a few characteristic genera, of which Anolis is, perhaps, the most highly specialized&nbsp;and the one which is composed of the greatest number of species ;&nbsp;this genus, however, is also well represented on the continent,&nbsp;especially in Central America.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">With regard to Ophidians the Tropical American region approaches the Indian in the number of species, which&nbsp;amounts to about four hundred, but it exhibits a comparatively less variety of generic and peculiar forms ; of&nbsp;the eighty genera only about fifty do not range beyond&nbsp;its limits. However, a boundary line which would&nbsp;separate the Ophidian fauna of South America from that&nbsp;of the north does not exist. In Central America and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Mexico the generic types of the south and north are intermingled, and as the climate, in accordance with&nbsp;latitude and altitude, assumes a more temperate character&nbsp;the specifically tropical Snakes disappear and are in part&nbsp;replaced by those of North America. This mixture of&nbsp;the two faunæ and the great variety of physical conditions&nbsp;within a small area account for the relatively very large&nbsp;number of Snakes of Central America. About one&nbsp;hundred and fifty out of the four hundred species attributed to the whole region belong to this district. The West-Indian Ophidians belong to the Tropical American fauna ;&nbsp;many continental generic forms of the latter occur in the&nbsp;islands, and such genera as are peculiar to the West&nbsp;Indies do not exhibit a common feature, or are founded&nbsp;on slight characters. The exact limits to which Snakes&nbsp;extend southwards are not known ; they seem to be very&nbsp;scarce on the southern confines of the Argentine Republic.&nbsp;Quite recently a Crotaline Snake, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinocerophis,</span><span class="font1"> has been&nbsp;discovered in eastern Patagonia.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of families peculiar to or highly characteristic of this fauna we can mention one only, viz., the small family&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scytalidæ,</span><span class="font1"> which replaces the Lycodonts of the Old&nbsp;World. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Boidæ</span><span class="font1"> are likewise a prominent feature,&nbsp;although not exclusively confined to South America ; of&nbsp;eleven genera eight are Tropical American, and three&nbsp;Australian. The true Boas include the most gigantic of&nbsp;Snakes, and replace the Old-World Pythons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this fauna a peculiar and highly ornamental pattern of coloration, which consists of more or less regularly&nbsp;alternate rings of black, red, and yellow, seems to be the&nbsp;more worthy of notice, as it occurs in very distinct families,&nbsp;viz., the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C alamarüdæ, Coronellidæ, Natrwidæ, Leptognαth-idæ, Scytalidæ, Tortricidæ, Elapidæ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Typhlopidæ more than twenty species have been described, and, besides, the Stenostomatidæ are represented by seven species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Tortricidæ one species occurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Calamariidæ are represented by thirteen genera, of which ten are peculiar. The most characteristic and geographically&nbsp;important are Elapomorρhus with ten, Hamalocranium with&nbsp;sixteen, Ninia with four species. The Indian genus Geoph⅛ is&nbsp;represented in Tropical America by twenty-five species.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Coronellidæ are extremely numerous (sixty-six species referable to thirteen genera). Of these Xenodon with twelve species, Liο-phis with sixteen, Erythrοlαmρrus, and Pliocereτιs deserve special&nbsp;mention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Colubers forms with elongate compressed body, approaching arboreal forms (Sqiilotes), are not scarce.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Freshwater Snakes are not abundant, but a genus peculiar to the region, Helieops, occurs in eight species. Tropidonotus might be&nbsp;regarded as absent, but for three or four species which occur north&nbsp;of the Isthmus of Panama and in the West Indies ; also the allied&nbsp;genus Tretaηοrhinus is confined to Central America and the West&nbsp;Indies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tree Snakes are extremely abundant—some seventy species referable to six genera, of which Dromicus, Philodryas, and Herpetodryas are very characteristic forms. Of Ahætulla some seventeen species&nbsp;are knoλvn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of Dipsas and allied genera only four species occur, but of tlιe peculiarly South-American Leptognathidæ some twenty-five species&nbsp;have been distinguished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Central America there occur two extremely singular forms which, however, are imperfectly known and seem tobe restricted to&nbsp;a very limited area. One, Loxoeemus, is considered a representative of the family Pythonidæ, and the other, Nοtοpsis, is stated to&nbsp;be the type of a distinct family allied to the Indian Xtmodermidæ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the twenty species of Boidæ the West Indian contingent amounts to no less than eight or nine, a fact which clearly&nbsp;demonstrates the pertinence of the West Indies to this region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Erycidæ are absent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Poisonous Snakes are numerous, the proportion to innocuous Snakes being as 1 : 8. Besides the singular occurrence in Venezuela&nbsp;of a member of the Atraetaspididæ, Dinodipsas, the Colubriform&nbsp;poisonous Snakes are represented by one genus only, Elaρs, which,&nbsp;however, shows numerous varieties or species, and is extremely&nbsp;common and widely spread over the region. Viperidæ are absent ;&nbsp;but the largest forms of Pit Vipers {Crotalidæ) are developed in this</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
