<p><span class="font1">Bargello. The general effect of the whole can best be seen at the South Kensington Museum, where a complete cast&nbsp;is fixed to the wall. The same museum possesses a study&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gesso duro</span><span class="font1"> for one of the panels, which appears to be&nbsp;the original sketch by Luca’s own hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In May 1437 Luca received a commission from the signoria of Florence to execute five reliefs for the north&nbsp;side of the campanile, to complete the series begun by&nbsp;Giotto and Andrea Pisano. These panels are so much in&nbsp;the earlier style of Giotto that we must conclude that he&nbsp;had left drawings from which Luca worked. They have&nbsp;representative figures chosen to typify grammar, logic,&nbsp;philosophy, music, and geometry,—the last represented&nbsp;by Euclid and Ptolemy.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> In 1438 Luca received an order&nbsp;for two marble altars for chapels in the cathedral, a third&nbsp;being ordered from Donatello. The reliefs from one of&nbsp;Luca’s—St Peter’s Deliverance from Prison and his Crucifixion—are now in the Bargello. It is probable that these&nbsp;altars were never finished. A tabernacle for the host,&nbsp;made by Luca in 1442, is now at Peretola in the church&nbsp;of S. Maria. A document in the archives of S. Maria&nbsp;Nuova at Florence shows that he received for this 700&nbsp;florins 1 lira 16 soldi (about £1400 of modern money).&nbsp;In 1437 Donatello received a commission to cast a bronze&nbsp;door for one of the sacristies of the cathedral ; but, as&nbsp;he delayed to execute this order, the work was handed&nbsp;over to Luca on 28th February 1446, with Michelozzo and&nbsp;Maso di Bartolomeo as his assistants. Part of this wonderful door was cast in 1448, and the last two panels were&nbsp;finished by Luca in 1467, with bronze which was supplied&nbsp;to him by Verrocchio.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> The door is divided into ten&nbsp;square panels, with small heads in the style of Ghiberti&nbsp;projecting from the framing. The two top subjects are&nbsp;the Madonna and Child and the Baptist, next come the&nbsp;four Evangelists, and below are the four Latin Doctors,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">each subject with attendant angels. The whole is modelled with the most perfect grace and dignified simplicity ; the&nbsp;heads throughout are full of life, and the treatment of the&nbsp;drapery in broad simple folds is worthy of a Greek sculptor&nbsp;of the best period of Hellenic art. These exquisite reliefs</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">are perfect models of plastic art, and are quite free from the over-elaboration and too pictorial style of Ghiberti. Fig.&nbsp;1 shows one of the panels. A terra-cotta relief at Berlin&nbsp;and another in the South Kensington Museum are probably&nbsp;original studies by Luca for two of the panels of the doctors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most important existing work in marble by Luca (executed in 1457-58)</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> is the tomb of Benozzo Federighi,&nbsp;bishop of Fiesole, originally placed in the church of S.&nbsp;Pancrazio at Florence, but now in S. Francesco di Paola on&nbsp;the Bello Sguardo road outside the city. A very beautiful&nbsp;effigy of the bishop in a restful pose lies on a sarcophagus&nbsp;sculptured with graceful reliefs of angels holding a wreath,&nbsp;which contains the inscription. Above are three-quarter-length figures of Christ between St John and the Virgin,&nbsp;delicately carved in low relief. The whole is surrounded&nbsp;by a rectangular frame formed of painted majolica tiles of&nbsp;the most exquisite beauty, far surpassing any other existing work of the same sort. On each tile is painted, with&nbsp;enamel pigments, a bunch of flowers and fruit in brilliant&nbsp;realistic colours, the loveliness of which is very hard to&nbsp;describe The perfect mean between truth to nature and&nbsp;decorative treatment has never been more thoroughly&nbsp;obtained than in these wonderful tile pictures, each of&nbsp;which is worthy of the most careful study ; and they are&nbsp;also of special interest as being among the earliest examples of Italian majolica. Though the bunch of flowers&nbsp;on each is painted on one slab, the ground of each tile&nbsp;is formed of separate pieces, fitted together like a kind&nbsp;of mosaic, probably because the pigment of the ground&nbsp;required a different degree of heat in firing from that&nbsp;needed for the enamel painting of the centre. The few&nbsp;other works of this class which exist do not approach the&nbsp;beauty of this early essay in majolica painting, on which&nbsp;Luca evidently put forth his utmost skill and patience.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the latter part of his life Luca was mainly occupied with the production of terra-cotta reliefs covered with&nbsp;enamel,—a process which he improved upon, but did not&nbsp;invent, as Vasari asserts. The secret of this process was&nbsp;to cover the clay relief with an enamel formed of the ordinary ingredients of glass </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(gnarzacottd)</span><span class="font1"> made an opaque&nbsp;white by oxide of tin,—a method practised with great&nbsp;success in the 13th century in Persia </span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> (see Pottery, vol.&nbsp;xix. pp. 620, 628). Though Luca was not the inventor&nbsp;of the process, yet his genius so improved and extended&nbsp;its application that it is not unnaturally known now as&nbsp;Della Robbia ware ; it must, however, be remembered that&nbsp;by far the majority of these reliefs which in Italy and elsewhere are ascribed to Luca are really the work of some of&nbsp;the younger members of the family. Comparatively few&nbsp;exist which can with certainty be ascribed to Luca himself.&nbsp;Among the earliest of these are medallions of the four&nbsp;Evangelists in the vault of Brunelleschi’s Pazzi chapel in&nbsp;S. Croce. These fine reliefs are coloured with various&nbsp;metallic oxides in different shades of blue, green, purple,&nbsp;yellow, and black. It has often been asserted that the&nbsp;very polychromatic reliefs belong to Andrea or his sons,&nbsp;and that Luca’s were all in pure white ; this, however,&nbsp;is not the case : colours .were used more freely by Luca&nbsp;than by his successors. A relief in the South Kensington&nbsp;Museum furnishes a striking example and is of especial&nbsp;value from its great size, and also because its date is&nbsp;known. This is an enormous medallion containing the&nbsp;arms of René of Anjou and other heraldic devices ; it is</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

Egidio (in S. Maria Nuova). It is a relief of the Coronation of the&nbsp;Virgin executed by Lorenzo de’ Bicci in 1424 ; see Milanesi, Archwio&nbsp;Stomco Itαliano, 1860, pp. 182-183. Contemporary writers call this&nbsp;enamelled clay “terra invetriata.”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
