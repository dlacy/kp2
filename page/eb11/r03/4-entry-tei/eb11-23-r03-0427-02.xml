                <p><label>ROCHEFORT</label> a town of western France, capital of an arrondissement
                    in the department of Charente-Inférieure, 20 m. S.S.E. of La Rochelle on the
                    State railway from Nantes to Bordeaux. Pop. (1906) town, 31,433; commune,
                    36,694. It is situated on the right bank of the Charente, 9 m. from the
                    Atlantic, and is built partly on the side of a rocky hill and partly on an old
                    marshland. The town is laid out with great regularity, the streets being wide
                    and straight and centring round the Place Colbert, in the middle of which is a
                    monumental fountain of the 18th century. The public institutions of Rochefort
                    comprise the sub-prefecture, tribunals of first instance and of commerce, a
                    board of trade arbitration, a chamber of commerce, a lycée for boys, a college
                    for girls and schools of drawing and architecture. The fortifications are
                    slight. Below Rochefort the Charente is crossed by a <hi rend="italic">pont
                        transbordeur,</hi> the carrier of which is suspended at a height which
                    admits of the tallest ships passing underneath at any time. There are both a
                    naval and a commercial harbour. The former has the advantage of deep anchorage
                    well protected by batteries at the mouth of the river, and the roadstead is
                    perfectly safe. The windings of the channel, however, between Rochefort and the
                    sea, and the bar at the entrance render navigation dangerous. Rochefort is
                    capital of the fourth maritime arrondissement, which stretches from the bay of
                    Bourgneuf to the coast of Spain. The naval harbour and arsenal, separated from
                    the town by a line of fortifications with three gates, contain large covered
                    building yards, repairing docks and extensive timber basins on both banks of the
                    river. The arsenal has also a ropewalk dating from 1668, a school of navigation
                    and pilotage, the offices of the maritime prefecture, the navy commissariat, a
                    park of · artillery and various boards of direction connected with the navy.
                    Other government establishments at Rochefort are barracks for infantry,
                    artillery and marines, and the naval hospital and school of medicine. In the
                    grounds of this last institution is an artesian well, sunk in 1862-1866 to a
                    depth of 2800 ft., and yielding water with a temperature of 100° F. The
                    commercial harbour, higher up the river than the naval harbour, has two small
                    basins, a third basin with an area of 15 acres and a depth at neap-tide of 25
                    ft., at spring-tide of 29I ft., and a dry dock no yds.
                    long. Besidesshipbuilding, which forms the staple industry, flour- and
                    saw-milling, sailcloth, &amp;c., are among the local manufactures. At the
                    ports of Rochefort and Tonnay-Charente (4 m. higher up) there entered, in 1905,
                    265 vessels (166 British), with a tonnage of 192,537·</p>
               <p>The lordship of Rochefort, held by powerful nobles as early as the nth century,
                    was united to the French Crown by Philip the Fair early in the 14th century; but
                    it was alternately seized in the course of the Hundred Years’ War by the English
                    and the French, and in the Wars of Religion by the Catholics and Protestants.
                    Colbert having in 1665 chosen Rochefort as the seat of a repairing port between
                    Brest and the Gironde, the town rapidly increased in importance; by 1674 it had
                    20,000 inhabitants; and when the Dutch admiral Cornelius Tromp appeared at the
                    mouth of the river with seventy-two vessels for the purpose of destroying the
                    new arsenal, he found the approaches so well defended that he gave up his
                    enterprise. It was at Rochefort that the naval school, afterwards transferred to
                    Brest, was originally founded. The town continued to flourish in the later part
                    of the 17th century. In 1690 and in 1703 the English made unsuccessful attempts
                    to destroy it. Its fleet, under the command of Admiral la Gallissonnière, a
                    native of the place, defeated Admiral Byng in 1755 and did good service in the
                    wars of the republic. But the destruction of the French fleet by the English in
                    1809 in the roadstead of île d’Aix, the preference accorded to the harlïours of
                    Brest and Toulon and the unhealthiness of its climate seriously interfered with
                    the prosperity of the place. The convict establishment, founded at Rochcfort in
                    1777, was suppressed in 1852.</p>
