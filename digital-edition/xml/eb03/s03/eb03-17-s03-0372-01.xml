                <p><label>SHIP-BUILDING</label>, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Naval Architecture,</hi> is
                    the art of conſtructing a ſhip ſo as to anſwer a particular purpoſe either of
                    war or merchandiſe.</p>
                <p>To whom the world is indebtedfor the invention of ſhips, is, like all other
                    things of equal antiquity, uncertain.</p>
                <p>A very ſmall portion of art or contrivance was ſeen in the first ſhips : they
                    were neither ſtrong nor durable; but conſiſted only of a few planks laid
                    together, without beauty or ornament, and juſt so compacted as to keep out the
                    water. In ſome places they were only the hulks or ſtocks of trees hollowed, and
                    then conſiſted only of one piece of timber. Nor was wood alone applied to this
                    uſe ; but any other buoyant materials, as the Egyptian reed papyrus ; or
                    leather, of which the primitive ſhips were frequently compoſed ; the bottom and
                    ſides being extended on a frame of thin battens or ſcantlings, of flexible wood,
                    or begirt with wickers, ſuch as we have frequently beheld amongſt the American
                    ſavages. In this manner they were often navigated upon the rivers of Ethiopia,
                    Egypt, and Sabæan Arabia, even in latter times. But in the ſirſt of them, we
                    find no mention of any thing but leather or hides ſewed together. In a veſſel of
                    this kind, Dardanus ſecured his retreat to the country afterwards called <hi
                        rend="italic">Troas,</hi> when he was compelled by a terrible deluge to
                    forſake his former habitation of Samothrace. According to Virgil, Charon’s
                    infernal boat was of the ſame compoſition.</p>
                <p>But as the other arts extended their influence, naval architecture likewiſe began
                    to emerge from the gloom of ignorance and barbariſm ; and as the ſhips of thoſe
                    ages were increaſed in bulk, and better proportioned for commerce, the
                    appearance of thoſe floating citadels of uuuſual form, full of living men,
                    flying with ſeemingly expanded wings over the ſurface of the untravelled ocean,
                    ſtruck the ignorant people with terror and aſtonilhment: and hence, as we are
                    told by Ariſtophanes, aroſe the fable of Perſeus flying to the Gorgons, who was
                    actually carried thither in a ſhip ! Hence, in all probability, the famous ſtory
                    of Triptolemus riding on a winged dragon is deduced, only becauſe he failed from
                    Athens, in the time of a great dearth, to a more plentiful country, to ſupply
                    the neceſſities of his people. The fiction of the ſſying horſe Pegaſus may be
                    joined with theſe, who, as ſeveral mythologiſts report, was nothing but a ſhip
                    with fails, and thence ſaid to be the offspring of Neptune the ſovereign of the
                    ſea ; nor does there appear any other foundation for the ſtories of griffins, or
                    of ſhips transformed into birds and fiſhes, which we ſo often meet with in the
                    ancient poets. So acceptable to the ſirſt ages of the world were inventions of
                    this nature, that whoever made any improvements in navigation or naval
                    architecture, building new ſhips better fitted for ſtrength or ſwiftneſs than
                    thoſe uſed before, or rendered the old more commodious by additional
                    contrivances, or diſcovered countries unknown to former travellers, were thought
                    worthy of the greateſt honours, and often aſſociated into the number of their
                    deified heroes. Hence we have in aſtronomy the ſigns of Aries and Taurus, which
                    were no other than two ſhips ; the former transported Phryxus from Greece to
                    Colchos, and the latter Europa from Phoenicia to Crete. Argo, Pegaſus, and
                    Perſeus, were likewiſe new ſhips of a different fort from the former, which
                    being greatly admired by the barbarous and uninſtructed people of thoſe times,
                    were tranſlated amongſt the ſtars, in commemoration of their inventors, and
                    metamorphoſed into constellations by the poets of their own and of ſucceeding
                    ages.</p>
                <p>The chief parts, of which ſhips anciently conſiſted, were three, viz. the belly,
                    the prow, and the ſtern: theſe were again compoſed of other ſmaller parts, which
                    ſhall be briefly deſcribed in their order. In the deſcription, we chiefly follow
                    Scheffer, who hath ſo eopiouſly treated this ſubject, and with ſuch induſtry and
                    learning collected whatever is neceſſary to illuſtrate it, that very little room
                    is left for enlargement by thoſe who incline to purſue this inveſtigation.</p>
                <p>I. In the belly, or middle part of the ſhip, there was τpo∙∏-if <hi
                        rend="subscript"> j</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">carina,</hi> or the “ keel,” which was compoſed of wood : it
                    was placed at the bottom of the ſhip, being deſigned to cut and glide through
                    the waves, and therefore was not broad, but narrow and ſharp ; whence it may be
                    perceived that not all ſhips, but only the which ſhips of war were called, whoſe
                    bellies were ſtraight and of a ſmall circumference, were provided with keels,
                    the reft having uſually flat bottoms. Around the outſide of the keel were fixed
                    pieces of wood, to prevent it from being damaged when the ſhip was ſirſt:
                    launched into the water, or afterwards ſtruck on any. rocks ; theſe were called
                    γfλtuσ∙gαrα <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> in Eatin <hi rend="italic"
                    >cunei.</hi></p>
                <p>Next to the keel was <hi rend="italic">t</hi>

                    contained the χvrλ&amp;lt;ov, or “ pump ;” through which water was conveyed out
                    of the ſhip.</p>
                <p>After this, there was <hi rend="italic">'</hi>

                    <hi rend="italic">vτ∣pa τ</hi>

                    <hi rend="italic">&amp;gt;&amp;gt;tr∣ς,</hi> or the “ second keel,” ſomewhat
                    reſembling what is now called the <hi rend="italic">kelſon ;</hi> it was placed
                    beneath the pump, and called λfσfrv, ^αλx,t,wf, κλοτ«σοί«»; by ſome it is
                    falſely ſupposed to be the ſame with 1≈λ×'f.</p>
                <p>Above the pump was an hollow place, called by Herodotus οιλ» τwf »Mi, by Pollux
                    xuroexand yαs^pα, becauſe large and capacious, after the form of a belly ; by
                    the Latins, <hi rend="italic">testudo.</hi> This was formed by crooked ribs,
                    with which it was ſurrounded, which were pieces of wood riſing from the keel
                    upwards, and called by Heſychius and by others, tiχo'λ&amp;lt;α, the belly of
                    the ſhip being contained within them: in Latin, <hi rend="italic">costae;</hi>
                    and in English, <hi rend="italic">timbers.</hi> Upon theſe were placed certain
                    planks.</p>
                <p>which Ariſtophanes calls <hi rend="italic">uτtpmui(,</hi> or fvτtpwvrtα</p>

                    paffed all the former parts on both hands ; theſe were compoſed of large rafters

                <p>In both theſe ſides the rowers had their places, called τo(<hi rend="subscript">

                    In theſe apartments were spaces through which the rowers put their oars : theſe
                    were ſometimes one continued vacuity from one end to the other, called <hi

                    paſſengers appear to have been placed. On the top of all there was a passage or
                    place to walk, called ra∙αpαJ⅛&amp;lt; <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> and

                <p>2. ∏ξ-apa, the “ prow or fore-deck,” whence it is ſometimes called and commonly
                    diſtinguiſhed by other metaphorical titles taken from human taces. In ſome
                    ſlrips there is mention of two prows, as alſo two ſterns ; ſuch'was Danaus’s
                    ſhip adorned by Minerva when he fled from Egypt. It was uſual to beautify the
                    prow with gold and various forts of paint and colours ; in the primitive times
                    red was most in uſe ; whence Homer’s ſlrips were commonly dignified with the
                    titles of ∣κ∣λr&amp;gt;OT <hi rend="subscript"> f</hi> w., and
                    ro∣v&amp;lt;χoσα,&amp;gt;&amp;gt;rι <hi rend="subscript"> j</hi> or “ red
                    faced;” the blue likewiſe, or ſky-colour, was frequently made uſe of, as bearing
                    a near reſemblance to the colour of the ſea; whence we findſhips called by Homer
                    χvow∏φa∕w&amp;lt;, by Ariſtophanes χυαv&amp;lt; <hi rend="subscript"> 1</hi>
                    u.Coλo∕. Several other colours were alſo made uſe of ; nor were they barely
                    varnished over with them, but very often annealed by wax melted in the fire, ſo
                    as neither the fun, winds, nor water, were able to deface them. The art of doing
                    this was called from the wax χ-χpoypαpftχ, from the fire ιfwwn&amp;gt;∣, which
                    is deſcribed by Vitruvius, and mentioned in
                    <bibl><author>Ovid</author></bibl>.</p>

                <p>In theſe colours the various forms of gods, animals, plants, &amp;c. were uſually
                    drawn, which were likewiſe often added as ornaments to other parts of the ſhips,
                    as plainly appears from the ancient monuments preſented to the world by
                    Bayſius.</p>
                <p>The ſides of the prow were termed <hi rend="italic">-∞Ι&amp;lt;sa,</hi> or “
                    wings,” and CTα,s&amp;lt;≈, according to Scheffer, or rather ««piiai ; for ſince
                    the prow is commonly compared to a human face, it will naturally follow that the
                    ſides ſhould be called <hi rend="italic">cheeks.</hi> Theſe are now called <hi
                        rend="italic">bows</hi> by our mariners.</p>

                    of the ſhip ; it was of a figure more inclining to round than the prow, the
                    extremity of which was ſharp, that it might cut the waters ; it was alſo built
                    higher than the prow, and was the place where the pilot ſat to ſteer ; the
                    outer-bending part of it was called e*∣σ∏in-, anſwering to our term <hi
                        rend="italic">quarter.</hi></p>
                <p>They had various ornaments of ſculpture on the prow ; as helmets, animals,
                    triumphal wreaths, &amp;c.— The ſtern was more particularly adorned with wings,
                    ſhields, &amp;c. Sometimes, a little maſt was erected whereon to hang ribbands
                    of divers colours, which ſerved in- ſtead of a flag to diſtinguiſh the ſhip ;
                    and a weathercock, to ſignify the part from whence the wind blew,.</p>
                <p>On the extremity of the plow was placed a round piece of wood, called the
                    sriy¾&amp;lt;f, from its bending ; and ſometimes the “ eye” of the ſhip, becauſe
                    six</p>
                <p>ed in the fore-deck ; on this was inſcribed the name of the ſhip, which was
                    uſually taken from the figure painted on the flag. Hence comes the frequent
                    mention of ſlrips called <hi rend="italic">Pegasi, Scyllae, bulls, rams,
                        tigers,</hi> &amp;c. which' the poets took the liberty to repreſent as
                    living creatures that transported their riders from one country to another.</p>
                <p>The whole fabric being completed, it was fortified with pitch, and ſometimes a
                    mixture of roſin, to secure the wood from the waters; whence it comes that
                    Homer's ships are everywhere mentioned with the epithet of ∕∕.fλαιvα&amp;lt;, or
                    “ black.” The firſt that made uſe of pitch were the inhabitants of Phæacia,
                    ſince called Corſica; ſometimes wax was employed in the ſame uſe whence

                <p>The ſhips of war of the ancients were diſtinguiſhed from other kinds of veſſels
                    by various turrets and accessions ot building, ſome to defend their own
                    ſoldiers, and others to annoy the enemy ; and from one another, in latter ages,
                    by ſeveral degrees or ranks of oars, the most uſual number of which was four or
                    five, which appear not to have been arranged, as ſome imagine, on the ſame level
                    in different parts of the ſhip; nor yet, as others have ſuppoſed, directly above
                    one another’s heads ;' but their seats being placed one behind another, aſcended
                    gradually, like Hairs. Ptolemy Philopater, urged by a vain-glorious deſire of
                    exceeding all the world besides in naval architecture, is ſaid to have farther
                    enlarged the number of banks to 40 ; and the ſhip being otherwiſe in equal
                    proportion, this raiſed her to ſuch an enormous bulk, that ſhe appeared at a
                    diſtance like a floating mountain or iſland ; and, upon a nearer view, like a
                    prodigious caſtle on the ocean. She was 280 cubits long,. 38. broad, and 48 high
                    (each cubit being 1 Engliſh foot 5½ inches), and carried 400 rowers, 400
                    ſailors, and 3000 ſoldiers. Another which the fame prince made to ſail on the
                    Nile, we are told, was half a ſtadium long. Yet theſe were nothing in compa-
                    riſon of Hiero’s ſhip, built under the direction of Archimedes ; on the
                    ſtructure whereof Moſchion wrote a whole volume. There was wood enough employed
                    in it to make 50 galleys ; it had all the variety of apartments of a palace ;
                    ſuch as banqueting-rooms, galleries, gardens, fiſh-ponds, ſtables, mills, baths,
                    and a temple to Venus. The floors of the middle apartment were all inlaid, and
                    repreſented in various colours the ſtories of Homer’s Iliad. The ceilings,
                    windows, and all other parts, were finiſhed with wonderful art, and embelliſhedl
                    with all kinds of ornaments. In the uppermoſt apartment there was a ſpacious
                    gymnasium, or place for exerciſe, and water was conveyed to the garden by
                        pipes.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0380.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0374"/>
                    ſome of hardened clay, and others of lead. The floors of the temple of Venus
                    were inlaid with agates and other precious ſtones ; the inſide lined with
                    cypreſs wood ; the windows adorned with ivory paintings and ſmall ſtatues. There
                    was likewiſe a library. This veſſel was adorned on all ſides with fine
                    paintings. It had 20 benches of oars, and was encompaſſed with an iron rampart,
                    eight towers, with walls and bulwarks, furniſhed with machines of war,
                    particularly one which threw a ſtone of 300 pounds, or a dart 12 cubits long,
                    the space of half a mile, with many other particulars related by Athenæus.
                    Caligula likewiſe built a veſl’el adorned with jewels in the poop, with ſails of
                    many colours, and furniſhed with large porticoes, bagnios, and banquet-
                    ing-rooms, beſides rows of vines, and fruit-trees of various kinds. But these,
                    and all ſuch monſtrous fabrics, ſerved only for ſhow and oſtentation, being
                    rendered by their vaſt bulk unwieldy and unfit for ſervice. Athenæus informs us,
                    the common names they were known by, were <hi rend="italic">Cyclades,</hi> or
                        <hi rend="italic">Ætna,</hi> i. e. “ iſlands, or mountains,” to which they
                    ſeemed nearly equal in bigneſs ; conſiſting, as ſome report, of as many
                    materials as would have compoſed 50 triremes, or ſhips of three banks.</p>
                <p>The veſſels employed by the northern nations appear to have been ſtill more
                    imperfect than thoſe of the Romans ; for a law was enacted in the reign of the
                    emperor Honorius, 24th September, A. D 418, inflicting capital puniſhment on any
                    who ſhould inſtruct the barbarians in the art of ſhip-building ; a proof at once
                    of the great eſtimation in which this ſcience was then held, and of the
                    ignorance of the barbarians with regard to it.</p>

                <p>The fleet of Richard I. of England, when he weighed anchor for the holy war from

                    however pernicious in other reſpects, this ſcience ſeems to owe ſome
                    improvements ; and to this particular one we are indebted for Richard’s marine
                    code, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">Laws of Oleron,</hi> from the name
                    of a ſmall iſland on the coaſt of France, where he compoſed them, and which moſt

                    mariners, from Bayonne in Guienne, being 30 men to each ſhip ; 7 ſhips and 184
                    men from Spain, which is 26 men to each ſhip ; one from Ireland, carrying 25 men

                <p>being ſcarcely 10 men to each ſhip ; and one from Guelderland, with 24 mariners.
                    Fifteen of theſe were called the king’s own ſhips, manned with 419 mariners,
                    being ſomewhat under 17 to each ſhip.</p>
                <p>Hiſtorians repreſent the veſsels of Venice and Genoa as the largeſt and the beſt
                    about this time, but they were loon exceeded in ſize by the Spaniſh veſſels
                    called c <hi rend="italic">arricks,</hi> ſome of which carried cannon ; and
                    theſe again were exceeded by the veſſels built by the northern people,
                    particularly thoſe belonging to the Hanſe-towns.— In the 14th century, the
                    Hanſiatics were the ſovereigns of the northern ſeas, as well without as within
                    the Baltic ; and their ſhips were ſo large, that foreign princes often hired
                    them in their wars. According to Hakluyt, an Engliſh ſhip from Newcaſtle, of 200
                    tons burden, was ſeized in the Baltic by thoſe of Wiſmar and Roſtock, <hi

                    Edward IV. took of him 247⁰ tons of ſhipping, amongſt which there was one ſhip
                    of 900 tons burden, another of 500 tons, and one of 400 tons, the rest being
                    ſmaller.</p>
                <p>In the year 1506, king James IV. of Scotland built the largeſt ſhip which had
                    hitherto been ſeen, but which was lost in her way to France in the year 1512,
                    owing probably to a defective conſtruction, and the unskilfulneſs of the crew in
                    managing ſo large a ſhip.</p>
                <p>About this time a very large ſhip was likewiſe built in France. In the fleet
                    fitted out by Henry VIII, <hi rend="italic">anno</hi> 1512, there was one ſhip,
                    the Regent, of 1000 tons burden, one of 500, and three of 400 each. A ſhip ſtill
                    larger than the Regent was built ſoon after, called <hi rend="italic">Henri
                        Grace Dieu l</hi> In the year 1522 the ſirſt voyage round the globe was
                    finiſhed.</p>
                <p>The Engliſh naval hiſtorians think that ſhips carried cannon on their upper decks
                    only, and had not gun- ports before the year 1545 ; and it is certain that many
                    of the largeſt ſhips in former times were fitted out from harbours, where ſhips
                    of a moderate ſize now would not have water enough to float them. In 1575 the
                    whole of the royal navy did not exceed 24 ſhips, and the number of
                    merchant-ſhips belonging to England amounted to no more than 135 veſſels above
                    100 tons, and 656 between 40 and 100 tons.<note anchored="false" place="margin"

                    guns. Smaller veſſels were occaſionally hired by her from private owners.</p>
                <p>In the memorable ſea-fight of Lepanto between the Turks and Chriſtians, <hi
                        rend="italic">anno 1571, no</hi> veſſels were employed but galleys ; and it
                    would appear from the car- cases of ſome of them, which are ſtill preſerved in
                    the arſenal at Venice, that even theſe were not ſo large or ſo well conſtructed
                    as thoſe of our times. The Invincible Armada, as Spaniſh vanity ſtyled it, once
                    the terror and admiration of nations, in the pompous and exaggerated
                    deſcriptions of which the Spaniſh authors of thoſe times dwelt with ſo much
                    apparent pleaſure, consiſted of 130 ſhips, near 100 of which were the ſtatelieſt
                    that had yet been ſeen on the ocean. The lar- geſt of theſe, however, would be
                    no more than a third rate veſſel in our navy, and they were ſo ill conſtructed,
                    that they would neither move eaſily, ſail near the wind, nor be properly worked
                    in tempeſtuous weather. The whole of the naval force collected by Queen
                    Elizabeth to oppoſe this formidable fleet, including hired veſſels, tenders,
                    ſtore-ſhips, &amp;c. amounted to no more than 143.</p>
                <p>Ship-building began now to make a conſiderable progreſs in Britain. Both war and
                    trade required an increaſe of ſhipping ; ſo that, in the year 1670, the annual
                    charge of the navy was reported to be L. 500,000; and in 1678 the navy consiſted
                    of 83 ſhips, of which 58 were of the line. At this time the exports amounted to
                    ten millions <hi rend="italic">per annum ;</hi> and the balance of trade was two
                    millions. In 1689 there were 173 ſhips, great and ſmall, in the royal navy, and
                    it has been conſtantly increaſing; ſo that in 1761 the ſhips in the navy
                    amounted to 372, of which 129 were of the line; and in the beginning of the year
                    1795, the total amount was above 430.</p>
                <p>As ſhips of the common conſtruction are found to be very defective in many
                    particulars, various methods have therefore from time to time been propoſed to
                    remove ſome of the bad qualities they poſſeſſed. As it would be an endleſs taſk
                    to enumerate the different inventions for this purpoſe, therefore a few of them
                    only will be mentioned.</p>
                <p>In 1663 Sir William Petty conſtructed a double ſhip, or rather a ſingle ſhip with
                    a double bottom, which was found to ſail conſiderably faſter than any of the
                    ſhips with which it had an opportunity of being tried. Her firſt voyage was from
                    Dublin to Holyhead; and in her return “ ſhe turned into that narrow harbour
                    againſt wind and tide, among rocks and ſhips, with ſuch dexterity as many
                    ancient ſeamen confeſſed they had never ſeen the like.” This veſſel with 70 more
                    were lost in a dreadful tempeſt.</p>
                <p>This ſubject was again revived by Mr Gordon, in his Principles of Naval
                    Architecture, printed at Aberdeen <hi rend="italic">anno</hi> 1784; where,
                    having delivered his ſentiments on the conſtruction of large Drafts, he ſays : “
                    Theſe ex</p>
                <p>periments likewiſe point out to us methods by which two veſſels may be laterally
                    connected together, though at a conſiderable diſtance from each other, in a
                    manner ſufficiently ſtrong, with very little increaſe of weight or expence of
                    materials, and without expoſing much surface to the action or influence of the
                    wind or the waves, or obſtructing their motion in any conſiderable degree, and
                    conſequently without being much oppoſed by them on that account under any
                    circumſtances ; and if veſſels are judiciouſly conſtructed with a view to ſuch a
                    junction, it would be no eaſy matter to enumerate all the advantages that may be
                    obtained by this means.” He then enumerates the advantages that double veſſels
                    would have over thoſe of the common conſtruction. Soon after double ſhips were
                    actually built by Mr Miller of Dalſwinton.</p>
                <p>Another plan was propoſed by Mr Gordon to make a ſhip ſail fast, draw little
                    water, and to keep a good wind. For this purpole, “ the bottom (he ſays) ſhould
                    be formed quite flat, and the tides made to rise perpendicular from it, without
                    any curvature ; which would not only render her more ſteady, as being more
                    oppoſed to the water in rolling, but likewiſe more convenient for ſtowage,
                    &amp;c. while the ſimplicity of the form would contribute greatly to the eaſe
                    and expedition with which ſhe might be fabricated. Though diminiſhing the
                    draught of water is, <hi rend="italic">cateris paribus,</hi> undoubtedly the
                    moſt effectual method of augmenting the velocity with which veſſels go before
                    the wind ; yet, as it proportionally diminiſhes their hold of the water, it
                    renders them extremely liable to be driven to leeward, and altogether incapable
                    of keeping a good wind. This defect may, however, be remedied, in a ſimple and
                    effectual manner, by proportionally augmenting the depth of keel, or, as ſo
                    large a keel would be inconvenient on many accounts, proportionally increaſing
                    their number ; as, in place of adding a keel eight feet deep to a veſſel drawing
                    six feet water, to affix to different parts of her flat bottom, which would be
                    well adapted for receiving them, six different keels of two feet deep each at
                    equal diſtances from each other, with proper intervals between ; which will be
                    found equally effectual for preventing theſe pernicious effects. Four ſuch,
                    indeed, would have anſwered the purpoſe as well as the eight feet keel, were it
                    not for the ſuperior preſſure or reſiſtance of the lower water<note

                            that the reſiſtance of a ball depending through the water 13 the ſame at
                            all depths ; nay, the heaping up of the yvater on the bow, occaſioning a
                            hydroſtaticaf preſſure in addition to the real reſiſtance, will make the
                            whole oppoſition to an equal surface, but of greater horizontal
                            dimenſions, greater, becauſe it bears a greater proportion to the

                <p>Thus then it appears, that a veſſel drawing eight feet water only, keels and all,
                    may be made to keep as good a wind, or be as little liable to be driven to
                    leeward, as the sharpeſt built veſſel of the ſame length drawing 14, nay 20 or
                    upwards, if a few more keels are added, at the ſame time that ſhe would be
                    little more reſiſted in moving in the line of the keels than a veſſel drawing
                    ſix feet water only. Theſe keels, beſides, would ſtrengthen the veſſel
                    conſiderably, would render her more ſteady, and leſs Hable to be overſet, and
                        thereby<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0382.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0376"/>
                    enable her to carry more ſail ; and Mr Gordon then enumerates the ſeveral
                    advantages that a ſhip of this conſtruction will poſſeſs.</p>
                <p>This plan has lately been put into execution by Captain Schank, with this
                    difference only, that inſtead of the keels being fixed as propoſed by Mr Gordon,
                    Captain Schank conſtructed them ſo as to ſlide down to a certain depth below the
                    bottom, or to be drawn up within the ſhip as occaſion might require.</p>
                <p>Captain Schank having communicated his plans to the Navy Board, two veſſels were
                    in conſequence ordered to be built of 13 tons each, and ſimilar in dimenſions,
                    one on the old conſtruction, and the other flat- bottomed, with Aiding keels. In
                    1790 a comparative trial in preſence of the commiſſioners of the navy was made
                    on the river Thames, each having the same quantity of sail ; and although the
                    veſſel on the old conſtruction had leeboards, a greater quantity of ballaſt, and
                    two Thames pilots aboard, yet Captain Schank’s veſſel with three Aiding keels
                    beat the other veſſel, to the aſtoniſhment of all preſent, one half of the whole
                    diſtance ſailed ; and no doubt ſhe would have beat her much more had she been
                    furniſhed with a Thames pilot.</p>
                <p>This trial gave ſo much ſatisfaction, that a king’s cutter of 120 tons was
                    immediately ordered to be built on the fame conſtruction, and Captain Schank was
                    requested to ſuperintend its building. This veſſel was launched at Plymouth in
                    1791, and named the <hi rend="italic">Trial.</hi> The length of this veſſel is
                    66 feet, breadth 21 feet, and depth of the hold ſeven feet : ſher bottom is
                    quite flat, and draws only six feet water, with all her guns, ſtores, &amp;c.
                    whereas all other veſſels of her tonnage on the old conſtruction draw 14 feet ;
                    ſo that ſhe can go with ſafety into almoſt any harbour or creek. She has three
                    sliding keels incloſed in a caſe or well ; they are each 14 feet in length ; the
                    fore and the after keels are three feet broad each, and the middle keel is six
                    feet broad. The keels are moveable by means of a winch, and may be let down
                    ſeven feet below the real keel ; and they work equally well in a ſtorm as in
                    ſtill water. Her hold is divided into ſeveral compartments, all water-tight, and
                    ſo contrived, that ſhould even a plank or two ſtart at ſea in different parts of
                    the veſſel, ſhe may be navigated with the greateſt ſecurity to any place. If ſhe
                    ſhould be driven on ſhore in a gale of wind, she will not ſoon become a wreck,
                    as her keels will be driven up into their caſes, and the ſhip being
                    flat-bottomed, will not be eaſily overſet ; and being able to go into ſuch
                    ſhallow water, the crew may all be eaſily ſaved. By means of her Aiding keels
                    ſhe is kept ſteady in the greateſt gale ; ſhe is quite eaſy in a great ſea, does
                    not strain in the leaſt, and never takes in water on her deck ; and when at
                    anchor, ſhe rides more upright and even than any other ſhip can do : ſhe ſails
                    very faſt either before or upon a wind ; no veſſel ſhe has ever been in company
                    with, of equal ſize, has been able, upon many trials, to beat her in failing ;
                    and yet her ſails ſeem too ſmall.</p>
                <p>It has alſo been propoſed to conſtruct veſſels of other materials than wood ; and
                    lately a veſſel was built whoſe bottom, inſtead of being plank, was copper.</p>

                        Ships.</hi></p>
                <p>A SHIP ought to be conſtructed ſo as to anſwer the particular purpoſe for which
                    ſhe is intended. It would be an eaſy matter to determine the form of a ſhip
                    intended to ſail by means of oars ; but, when sails are uſed, a ſhip is then
                    acted upon by two elements, the wind and water : and therefore it is much more
                    difficult than is commonly imagined to aſcertain the form of a ſhip ſo as to
                    anſwer in an unfavourable as well as a favourable wind ; the ſhip at the same
                    time having a cargo of a certain, weight and magnitude.</p>
                <p>Every ſhip ought to ſail well, but particularly when the wind is upon the beam ;
                    for this purpoſe a conſiderable length in proportion to the breadth is
                    necessary, and the plane of reſiſtance ſhould be the leaſt poſſible. The main
                    frame ſhould alſo be placed in a proper ſituation ; but according to the
                    experiments of Mr Chapman<note anchored="true" n="7" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Traite de la Construction de Vaisseaux, p.
                        40</p></note> *, its plane is variable with the velocity of the ſhip : the
                    mean place of the main frame, has, however, been generally eſtimated to be about
                    one-twelfth of the length of the keel before the middle. Without a ſufficient
                    degree of ſtability a ſhip will not be able to carry a preſs of ſail : a great
                    breadth in proportion to the length and low upper-works will augment the
                    ſtability. The following particulars being attended to, the above property will
                    be gained, and the ſhip will alſo ſteer well. The wing tranſom ſhould be carried
                    pretty high ; the faſhion-pieces well formed, and not full below the load
                    water-line : the lower part of the item to be a portion of a circle, and to have
                    a conſiderable rake : the ſternpoſt to be nearly perpendicular to the keel ; and
                    all the upper works kept as low as poſſible.</p>
                <p>Many ſhips from conſtruction are liable to make much leeway. This may in a great
                    meaſure be avoided by giving the ſhip a long keel, little breadth, and a
                    conſiderable depth in the hold : whence the bow will meet with little reſiſtance
                    in compariſon to the ſide, and therefore the ſhip will not fall much to the
                    leeward.</p>
                <p>Another very great retardation to the velocity of a ſhip is her pitching. The
                    principal remedy for this is to increaſe the length of the keel and floor, to
                    diminiſh the rising afore and abaft, and to conſtruct the hull in ſuch a manner
                    that the contents of the fore-body- may be duly proportioned to the contents of
                    the afterbody.</p>
                <p>In a ſhip of war the lower tier of guns ought to be of a ſufficient height above
                    the water, otherwiſe it will be impoſſible to work the lee-guns when it blows
                    hard. This property will be obtained by giving her a long floor-timber, little
                    riſing, a full midſhip frame, light upper works, and the wing tranſom not too
                    high : And in every ſhip the extreme breadth ought always to be higher afore and
                    abaft than at midſhips.</p>
                <p>A merchant ſhip, besides being a fast ſailer, ought to carry a conſiderable cargo
                    in proportion to its length, to ſail with little ballaſt, and to be navigated
                    with few hands.</p>
                <p>That a ſhip may take in a conſiderable cargo, it<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0383.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0377"/> ſhould have a
                    great breadth and depth in proportion to its length, a full bottom, and a long
                    and flat floor. But a ſhip of this conſtruction will neither ſail faſt, nor
                    carry much ſail.</p>
                <p>If a ſhip be filled out much towards the line of floatation, together with low
                    upper works, ſhe will require little ballaſt : and that ſhip which is ſtiff from
                    conſtruction is much better adapted for failing faſt than one which, in order to
                    carry the ſame quantity of canvas, is obliged to be loaded with a much greater
                    weight : for the reſiſtance is as the quantity of water to be removed, or nearly
                    as the area of a tranſverſe ſection of the immerſed part of the body at the
                    midship frame ; and a body that is broad and ſhallow is much ſtiffer than one of
                    the ſame capacity that is narrow and deep. “ The advantages (ſays Mr Gordon) are
                    numerous, important, and obvious.<note anchored="true" place="margin"
                        type="authorial"><hi rend="italic">Principles of Naval Architecture,</hi> p.
                        100.</note> For it is evident, that by enlarging, perhaps doubling, the
                    breadth of veſſels, and forming their bottoms flat and well furniſhed with
                    keels, they muſt, in the firstplace, become much ſteadier, roll little, if any,
                    and be enabled to carry greatly more ſail, and that in a better direction, at
                    the ſame time that they would be in no danger of being diſmaſted or overſet,
                    unleſſs the maſts were of a moſt extraordinary height indeed. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Secondly,</hi> They would have little or no occaſion for ballaſt, and if
                    any was uſed, could incur leſs danger from its ſhifting. <hi rend="italic"
                        >Thirdly,</hi> That there would be much more room upon deck, as well as
                    accommodation below ; the breadth being ſo much increaſed without any diminution
                    of the height above the load-water line. <hi rend="italic">Fourthly,</hi> That
                    they would deviate much leſs from the intended courſe, and penetrate the water
                    much eaſier in the proper direction : for doubling the breadth, without any
                    increaſe of weight, would diminiſh the depth or draught of water one half ; and
                    though the extent of the directly oppoſmg ſurface would be the ſame as before,
                    yet the veſſel in moving would meet with half the former reſiſtance only : for
                    so great is the difference between the pressure, force, or reaction, of the
                    upper and the under water. <hi rend="italic">Fifthly,</hi> That they would by
                    this means be adapted for lying unſupported in docks and harbours when dry, be
                    rendered capable of being navigated in ſhallow water, and of being benefited by
                    all the advantages attending that very important circumſtance ; and it is
                    particularly to he obſerved, that making veſſels which may be navigated in
                    ſhallow water, may, in many reſpects, juſtly be regarded as a matter of equal
                    importance with increaſing the number of harbours, and improving them, as having
                    identically the ſame effects with regard to navigation ; at the ſame time, that
                    the benefits which would result from ſuch circumſtances are obtained by this
                    means without either expence, trouble, or inconveniency : beſides, it would not
                    only enable veſſels to enter many rivers, bays, and creeks, formerly
                    inacceſſible to ſhips of burden, but to proceed to ſuch places as are moſt land
                    locked, where they can lie or ride moſt ſecure, and with leaſt expence of men
                    and ground tackle. As ſhips of war would carry their guns well by being ſo
                    Ready, there could be but little occaſion for a high topside, or much height of
                    hull above water ; and as little or no ballaſt would be required, there would be
                    no neceſſity, as in other veſſels, for increaſing their weight on that account,
                    and thereby pressing them deeper into the water. Theſe are very important
                    circum</p>
                <p>ſtances, and would contribute much to improve the sailing of ſuch veſſels.” From
                    whence it appears, that there would be united, what has hitherto been deemed
                    irreconcileable, the greateſt poſſible ſtability, which is nearly as the area of
                    a tranverſe lection of the immerſed part of the body at the midſhip frame : and
                    a body that is broad and ſhallow is much ſtiffer than one of the ſame capacity
                    that is narrow and deep. A ſhip of this conſtruction may take in a conſiderable
                    cargo in proportion to her ſize ; but if deeply loaded will not ſail fast, for
                    then the area of a ſection of the immerſed part at the midſhip frame will be
                    very conſiderable, and as the sails of ſuch a ſhip muſt neceſſarily be large,
                    more hands will therefore be required.</p>
                <p>The leſs the breadth of a ſhip, the fewer hands will be neceſſary to work her ;
                    as in that caſe the quantity of ſail will be leſs, and the anchors alſo of leſs
                    weight. We ſhall gain much (ſays M. Bouguer) by making the extreme breadth no
                    more than the fifth or ſixth part of the length, if, at the ſame time, we
                    diminish the depth proportionally ; and likewise this moſt ſurpriſing
                    circumſtance, that by diminiſhing these two dimenſions, or by increaſing the
                    length, a ſhip may be made to go ſometimes as fall as the wind.</p>
                <p>In order to obtain the preceding properties, very oppoſite rules muſt be followed
                    ; and hence it appears to be impoſſible to conſtruct a ſhip ſo as to be
                    posſeſsed of them all. The body, however, muſt be ſo formed, that as many of
                    theſe properties may be retained as poſſible, always obſerving to give the
                    preference to thoſe which are moſt required. If it is known what particular
                    trade the ſhip is to be employed in, thoſe qualities are then principally to be
                    adhered to which are moſt eſſentially neceſſary for that employment.</p>
                <p>It may easily be demonſtrated that ſmall ſhips will not have the ſame advantages
                    as large ones of a similar form, when employed in the ſame trade : for a large
                    ſhip will not only ſail faster than a ſmall one of a similar form, but will alſo
                    require fewer hands to work her. Hence, in order that a ſmall ſhip may poſſeſs
                    the ſame advantages as a large one, the correſponding dimenſions will not be
                    proportional to each other. The reader will ſee in Chapman’s Architect <hi
                        rend="italic">ura Navalis Mercatoria</hi> ample tables of the ſeveral
                    dimenſions of ſhips, of different claſſes and sizes, deduced from theory

                    of the gun-ports. Several imaginary lines, namely, the upper and lower height of
                    breadth lines, water lines, &amp;c. are alſo drawn in this plan.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">half breadth</hi> or <hi rend="italic">floor plan,</hi> or,
                    as it is frequently called, the <hi rend="italic">horizontal</hi> plane,
                    contains the ſeveral halfbreadths of every frame of timbers at different heights
                    ; ribbands, water lines, &amp;c. are alſo deſcribed on this plane.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">body</hi> plan, or <hi rend="italic">plane of
                        projection,</hi> is a ſection of the ſhip at the midſhip frame or broadeſt
                    place, perpendicular to the two former. The ſeveral breadths, and the particular
                    form of every frame of timbers, are deſcribed on this plane. As the two ſides of
                    a ſhip are ſimilar to each other, it is therefore unneceſſary to lay down both;
                    hence the frames contained between the main frame and the ſtem are deſcribed on
                    one fide of the middle line, commonly on the right hand side, and the after
                    frames are deſcibed on the other side of that line.</p>
                <p>Several lines are deſcribed on theſe planes, in order the more readily to aſſiſt
                    in the formation of the timbers ; the principal of which are the following :</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">top-timber line,</hi> is a curve limiting the height of the
                    ſhip at each timber.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">top-timber halſ breadth line,</hi> is a ſection of the ſhip
                    at the height of the top-timber line, perpendicular to the plane of
                    elevation.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">height oſ breadth lines,</hi> are two lines named the upper
                    and <hi rend="italic">lower</hi> heights of breadth. Theſe lines are deſcribed
                    on the plane of elevation to determine the height of the broadeſt part of the
                    ſhip at each timber ; and being deſcribed in the body plan, limits the height
                    and breadth of each frame at its broadeſt part.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Main half breadth,</hi> is a ſection of the ſhip at the
                    broadeſt part, perpendicular to the ſheer plan, and repreſents the greateſt
                    breadth at the outſide of every timber.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Water lines,</hi> are lines ſuppoſed to be deſcribed on the
                    bottom of a ſhip when afloat by the ſurface of water ; and the uppermoſt of
                    theſe lines, or that deſcribed by the water on the ſhip’s bottom when
                    ſufficiently loaded, is called the <hi rend="italic">loud water line.</hi>
                    According as the ſhip is lightened, ſhe will riſe higher out of the water ; and
                    hence new water lines will be formed. If ſhe be lightened in ſuch a manner that
                    the keel may preſerve the same inclination to the ſurface of the water, theſe
                    lines will be parallel to each other ; and if they are parallel to the keel,
                    they will be repreſented by ſtraight lines parallel to each other in the body
                    plan ; otherwiſe by curves. In the half breadth plan, theſe lines are curves
                    limiting the half breadth of the ſhip at the height of the correſponding lines
                    in the ſheer plan. In order to diſtinguish theſe lines, they are uſually drawn
                    in green.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Ribband lines,</hi> are curves on a ſhip’s bottom by the
                    interſection of a plane inclined to the plane of elevation ; and are denominated
                        <hi rend="italic">diagonal</hi> or horizontal, according as they are
                    meaſured upon the diagonal, or in a direction perpendicular to the plane of
                    elevation. Both theſe answer to the same curve on the ſhip’s bottom, but give
                    very different curves when deſcribed on the half breadth plan.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Frames,</hi> are circular pieces of timber bolted together, and
                    raised upon the keel at certain diſtances, and to which the planks are faſtened.
                    A frame is compoſed of one floor-timber, two or three futtocks, and a top-
                    timber on each side : which being united together, form a circular incloſure,
                    and that which incloſes the greateſt ſpace is called the <hi rend="italic"
                        >midſhip</hi> or <hi rend="italic">main</hi> frame. The arms of the
                    floor-timber of this frame form a very obtuſe angle ; but in the other frames
                    this angle decreaſes with the diſtance oſ the frame from midſhips. Thoſe floor
                    timbers which form very acute angles are called <hi rend="italic">crutches.</hi>
                    The length of the midſhip floor timber is in general about half the length of
                    the main frame.</p>
                <p>A frame of timbers is commonly formed by arches of circles called <hi
                        rend="italic">ſweeps.</hi> There are generally five ſweeps :1st, The <hi
                        rend="italic">floor ſweep ;</hi> which is limited by a line in the body plan
                    perpendicular to the plane of elevation, a little above the keel ; and the
                    height of this line above the keel at the midſhip frame is called the <hi
                        rend="italic">dead rising.</hi> The upper part of this arch forms the head
                    of the floor timber. <hi rend="italic">2d,</hi> The <hi rend="italic">lower
                        breadth ſweep ;</hi> the centre of which is in the line repreſenting the
                    lower height of breadth, 3 <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> The <hi rend="italic"
                        >reconciling ſweep.</hi> This ſweep joins the two former, without
                    intersecting either ; and makes a fair curve from the lower height of breadth to
                    the riſing line. If a ſtraight line is drawn from the upper edge of the keel to
                    touch the back of the floor ſweep, the form of the midſhip frame below the lower
                    height of breadth will be obtained. The <hi rend="italic">upper breadth ſweep
                        ;</hi> the centre of which is in the line repreſenting the upper height of
                    breadth oſ the timber. This ſweep deſcribed upwards forms the lower part of the
                    top timber. <hi rend="italic">5th,</hi> The <hi rend="italic">top timber
                        ſweep</hi> is that which forms the hollow of the top timber. This hollow is,
                    however, very often formed by a mould, ſo placed as to touch the upper breadth
                    ſweep, and paſs through the point limiting the half breadth oſ the top
                    timber.</p>
                <p>The main frame, or as it is uſually called <hi rend="italic">dead-flat,</hi> is
                    denoted by the character ⊕. The timbers before dead- flat are marked A, B, C,
                    &amp;c. in order ; and thoſe abaft dead-flat by the figures 1, 2, 3, &amp;c. The
                    timbers adjacent to dead-flat, and of the same dimenſions nearly, are
                    diſtinguiſhed by the characters (A), (B), &amp;c. and (1), (2), &amp;c. That
                    part of the ſhip abaft the main frame is called the <hi rend="italic">after body
                        ;</hi> and that before it the <hi rend="italic">fore body.</hi></p>
                <p>AU. timbers are perpendicular to the half breadth plan. Thoſe timbers whoſe
                    planes are perpendicular to the ſheer plan, are called <hi rend="italic">ſquare
                        timbers ;</hi> and thoſe whoſe planes are inclined to it are called <hi
                        rend="italic">canted timbers.</hi></p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">rising line,</hi> is a curve drawn in the ſheer plan, at
                    the heights of the centres of the floor ſweeps in the body plan. As, however,
                    this line, if drawn in this manner, would extend beyond the upper line of the
                    figure, it is, therefore uſually so drawn that its lower part may touch the
                    upper edge of the keel. This is performed by taking the heights of each of the
                    centres in the, body plan, from the height of the centre of the ſweep of
                    dead-flat, and fitting them off on the correſponding timbers in the, sheer plan
                    from the upper edge of the keel.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Half breadth of the rising,</hi> is a curve in the floor plan,
                    which limits the diſtances of the centres of the floor ſweeps from the middle

                    the keel for some timbers afore and abaft the midſhip frame ; for which reaſon
                    these timbers are called <hi rend="italic">flats :</hi> but in sharp ſhips it
                    riſes gradually from the main frame, and ends on the ſtem and poſt.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">Cutting down line,</hi> is a curve drawn on the plane of

                    between them. In forming the timbers, one mould serves for two, the fore- ſide
                    of the one being ſuppoſed to unite with the aſtſide of the other, and ſo make
                    only one line, which is called the joint of <hi rend="italic">the

                    doubt, a problem of conſiderable difficulty ; and, from theory, it may be ſhown
                    that there are no determinate proportions ſubsisting between the length,
                    breadth, and depth, by which theſe dimenſions may be ſettled ; yet, by combining
                    theory and practice, the proportional dimenſions may be approximated to pretty
                    nearly.</p>
                <p>As ſhips are conſtructed for a variety of different purpoſes, their principal
                    dimenſions muſt therefore be altered accordingly, in order to adapt them as
                    nearly as poſſible to the propoſed intention ; but ſince there is no fixed
                    ſtandard whereby to regulate theſe dimenſions, the methods therefore introduced
                    are numerous, and in a great meaſure depend upon cuſtom and fancy.</p>
                <p>With regard, however, to the proportional dimen-<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0386.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0380"/> sions, they
                    perhaps may be inferred from the circle. Thus, if the extreme breadth be made
                    equal to the diameter, the length at the load water line, or the diſtance
                    between the rabbets of the ſtem and poſt at that place,may be made equal to the
                    circumference of the ſame circle ; and the depth of the hold equal to the
                    radius, the upper works being continued upwards according to circumſtances. A
                    ſhip formed from theſe dimenſions, with a bottom more or left full according as
                    may be judged neceſſary, will no doubt anſwer the propoſed intention.
                    Nevertheleſs, one or other of theſe dimenſions may be varied in order to gain
                    ſome eſſential property, which the trade that the veſſel is intended for may
                    require.</p>

                    of their keels deep enough, that the upper part may be made to admit a rabbet
                    for the gar- board ſtreak, that the main body and bearing part of the ſhips
                    bottoms may be made to form an arch downwards in their length, ſuppoſe with the
                    ſame sheer as their bends, at the rate of about 2 inches for every 30 feet of
                    the extreme length of the keel towards the midſhip or main frame, which may be
                    reckoned the crown of the arch ; and the lower part of the keel to be made
                    straight, but laid upon blocks so that it may form a regular convex curve
                    downwards at the rate of an inch for every 30 feet of the extreme length of the
                    keel, the loweſt part exactly under the main frame ; which curve, I reckon, is
                    only a ſufficient allowance for the keel to become ſtraight below, after they
                    are launched afloat, by the preſſure of the water upward againſt their floors
                    amidſhip, which cauſes their tendency to hog. And certainly a ſtraight keel is a
                    great advantage in failing, as well as to ſupport them when laid upon level
                    ground or on ſtraight blocks in a repairing dock, without taking damage.</p>
                <p>2. “As ſquare ſterned ſhips, from experience, are found to anſwer all trades and
                    purpoſes better than round or pink ſterned ſhips, I would recommend the fore
                    part of the ſternpoſt, on account of drawing the water lines in the draught,
                    only to have a few inches rake, that the after part may stand quite upright
                    perpendicular to the keel : and for the rake of the stem I would propoſe the
                    rabbet for the hudding ends for the entrance, and bows from the keel upwards, to
                    form the ſame curve as the water line from the ſtem at the harpin towards the
                    main breadth, and the bows at the harpin to be formed by a ſweep of a circle of
                    half the three- fourths of the main breadth ; and the main tranſom to be
                    three-fourths of the main-breadth ; and the buttocks, at the load or failing
                    mark aft, to be formed, in the ſame manner as the bows at the harpin, with a
                    ſweep of a circle of half the three fourths of the main breadth, to extend just
                    as far from the ſtem and ſtern poſt as to admit a regular convex curve to the
                    main frame, and from theſe down to the keel to form regular convex water- lines,
                    without any of thoſe unnatural, hollow, concave, ones, either in the entrance or
                    run ; which rules, in my opinion, will agree with the main body of the ſhip,
                    whether ſhe is designed to be built full for burden or sharp below for
                    sailing.</p>
                <p>3. “ This rule for raking the ſtem will admit all the water-lines in the ſhip’s
                    entrance to form convex curves all the way from the ſtem to the midſhip or main
                    frame, which anſwes much better for failing as well as making a ship more easy
                    and lively in bad weather. And the bows ſhould flange off, rounding in a
                    circular form from the bends up to the gunwale, in order to meet the main
                    breadth the ſooner, with a ſweep of half the main breadth at the gunwale
                    amidſhips ; which will not only prevent them greatly from being plunged under
                    water in bad weather, but ſpread the ſtanding fore-rigging the more, to ſupport
                    theſe material masts and fails forward to much greater advantage than in thoſe
                    over ſharp bowed ſhips, as has been mentioned. And as the foiling trim of ſhips
                    in general is more or left by the stern, this makes the water lines of the
                    entrance in proportion the ſharper to divide the particles of water the easier,
                    so that the ſhip may preſs through it with the leaſt resistance.</p>
                <p>4. “ The run ought to be formed ſhorter or longer, fuller or ſharper, in
                    proportion to the entrance and main body, as the ſhip is designed for burden or
                    sailing faſt. The convex curves of the water lines ſhould lessen gradually from
                    the load or foiling mark aft, as has been mentioned, downwards, till a fair
                    ſtraight taper is formed from the after part of the floor to the ſternpoſt
                    below, without any concavity in the water lines ; which will not only add
                    buoyancy and burden to the after body and run of the ſhip, but, in my opinion,
                    will help both her sailing and ſteering motions ; for the preſſure of the water,
                    as it cloſes and rises upon it to come to its level again, and fill up that
                    hollow which is made by the fore and main body being pressed forward with sail,
                    will impinge, and act with more power to help the ſhip forward in her
                    progreſſive motion, than upon thoſe unnatural concave runs, which have so much
                    more flat dead wood, that muſt, in proportion, be a hinderance to the ſtern
                    being turned so eaſily by the power of the helm to ſteer the ſhip to the
                    greateſt advantage.”</p>
                <p>Many and various are the methods which are employed to deſcribe the ſeveral parts

                    of the length before the main frame or dead flat ; therefore make R⊕ equal to
                    five- twelfths of QR, and ⊕ will be the station of the main frame ; ſpace the

                    made very full ; but if ſhe is intended to ſail fast, it is usually made ſharp.

                    that which to him appears preferable. In order to save repetition, it is judged

                    and BF, perpendicular to AB. Then, since the two ſides of a ſhip are ſimilar, it
                    is therefore thought ſufficient to deſcribe the half of each frame between the

                    of thoſe before the main frame on the other side of it. The firſt half is called

                    ſpeaking, it appears that a main frame formed of ſtraight lines will have both
                    the advantage and ſimplicity over others.” To illuſtrate this, draw the ſtraight
                    line M N ( fig. 9. ) in such a manner that the mixtitineal space M <hi

                    formed of ſtraight lines than in the other, it will therefore be more

                    the ribband MN. The ſame proceſs is to be followed to divide the other ribbands,
                    obſerving to apply the fourth ribband to the triangle, ſo that it may make an
                    angle of 86 degrees with the line SM ; the fifth ribband to make an angle of 65
                    degrees, and the ſixth an angle of 60 degrees with the line SM.</p>
                <p>The quantities of theſe angles are, however, far from being preciſely fixed. Some
                    conſtructors, in applying the ribbands to the triangle, make them all parallel
                    to its baſe ; and others vary the meaſures of theſe angles according to fancy.
                    It may alſo be remarked, that a different method of dividing the baſe of the
                    triangle is uſed by ſome. It is certainly proper to try different methods ; and
                    that is to be preferred which beſt anſwers the intended purpoſe.</p>
                <p>Beſide the frames already mentioned, there are other two laid down by ſome
                    conſtructors in the ſeveral plans, called <hi rend="italic">balance frames.</hi>
                    The after balance frame is placed at one fourth of the length of the ſhip before
                    the ſternpoſt ; and the other, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">looſ
                        frame,</hi> at one fourth oſ the ſhip’s length aft of a pernendicular to</p>
                <p>the keel from the rabbet of the ſtem. Let the dotted line at X, between the fifth
                    and ſixth frames, (fig. 23.) be the place of the after balance frame in the
                    plane of elevation. Then, in order to lay down this frame in the plane of
                    projection, its repreſentation muſt be previouſly drawn in the triangle. To
                    accomplish this, draw the line SV (ſig. 22.) ſo that the interval 5V may have
                    the ſame ratio to 5 6 (fig. 22.) that 5 X has to 5 6 (fig. 23.)<note
                        anchored="true" n="8" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="smallcaps">(d)</hi> It is evident, from the method uſed to
                            di’vide the baſe of the triangle, that this proportion does not agree
                            exactly with the conſtruction ; the difference, however, being ſmall, is
                            therefore neglected in practice.</p></note> (D). Then the ſeveral points
                    in the ribbands in the plane of projection anſwering to this frame are to be
                    found by means of the triangle in the ſame manner as before.</p>
                <p>The loof frame is nearly of the ſame dimenſions as the after balance frame, or
                    rather of a little greater capacity, in order that the centre of gravity of that
                    part of the ſhip may be nearly in the plane of the midſhip frame. Hence the loof
                    frame may be eaſily drawn in the plane of projection, and hence alſo the other
                    frames in the fore body may be readily deſcribed.</p>

                <p>Draw the middle line of the ſtem AB (fig. 24.) ∙ make AC, BD each equal to half
                    the thickneſs of the ſtem, and draw the line CD ; deſcribe alſo one half of the
                    main frame CEFGHI. Let eE, fF,, gG, hH, be water lines at the heights of the

                    the loof frame. Or ſince it is neceſſary that the capacity of the loof frame
                    ſhould be a little greater than that of the after balance frame, each of the
                    above lines may be increaſed by a proportional part of itſelf, as one-tenth or
                    one-twentieth, as may be judged proper.</p>
                <p>Conſtruct the triangle (fig. 25.) in the ſame manner as fig. 22. only obſerving,
                    that as there are fewer frames in the fore than in the after body, its baſe will
                    therefore be divided into fewer parts. Let there be eight frames in the fore
                    body, then there will be eight diviſions in the baſe of the triangle beſide the
                    extremes.</p>
                <p>Let fig. 26. repreſent the ſtem and part of the fore- body in the plane of

                    SB, the point E on thc line SM, and the point anſwering to the loof frame on the
                    dotted line SZ ; and mark upon the card the ſeveral points of interſection of
                    the lines Si,</p>
                <p>S 2, &amp;c. Now apply the card to the ribband . <hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> E
                    (fig. 24.) as before, and transfer the ſeveral points of diviſion from it to the

                    through the correſuonding points in the ribbands will be the projection of the
                    lower part of the frames in the fore body. The projections of the top-timbers of
                    the ſeveral frames may be taken from the half breadth plan ; and hence each
                    top-timber may be eaſily deſcribed.</p>
                <p>In large ſhips, particularly in thoſe of the French navy, a different method is
                    employed to form the top- timbers in the fore body, which is as follows :</p>
                <p>Let BI (fig. 27.) be one fourth of the breadth of the ſhip, and draw IK parallel
                    to AB. Take the height of the foremoſt frame from the plane of elevation, and
                    lay it off from A to B : from the point B draw BH perpendicular to AB, and equal
                    to half the length of the wing tranſom. Let E be the place of the breadth
                    ribband on the main frame, and F its place on the ſtem at the height of the wing
                    tranſom. With a radius equal to five-sixths of half the greatdſt breadth of the
                    ſhip deſcribe the quadrant EFG (fig. 28.) : Make EH equal to FG (fig. 27.), the
                    point F being at the height of the wing tranſom. Through H draw HO perpendicular
                    to EH, and interſecting the circumference in O ; then draw OL parallel to HE,
                    and EL parallel to HO. Divide EL into as many equal parts as there are frames in
                    the fore body, including the main frame, and from theſe points of diviſion draw
                    the perpendiculars 11, 22, &amp;c. meeting’ the circumference as in the figure.
                    Take the diſtance 11, and lay it off from G (fig. 27.) towards F to the point 1
                    ; and from the ſame point G lay off towards F the ſeveral perpendiculars
                    contained between the ſtraight line and the Curve to the points 2, 3, &amp;c.
                    and through theſe points draw lines parallel to EG.</p>
                <p>Take any line AB (fig. 29.) at pleaſure : divide it equally in two in the point 8
                    ; divide 8 B in two parts in the point 7, and continue this method of diviſion
                    until there are as many points as there are frames in the fore body, including
                    the main frame. Upon AB conſtruct the equilateral triangle ACB, and draw the
                    lines G8, C7, &amp;c. Place a flip of card on the parallel a K 8 (fig. 27.), and
                    mark thereon the points oppoſite to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> K, and 8 ; and let
                    them be denoted accordingly. Then apply this flip of card to the triangle, ſo
                    that the point <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which is that anſwering to the rabbet
                    of the stem, may be on the line AC ; that the point anſwering to K may be on C
                    8, and the extremity 8 on the line CB ; and mark on the card the points of
                    interſection of the lines C 7, C6, &amp;c. and number them accordingly. Now
                    apply this flip of card to the ſeventh parallel (fig. 23.), the point <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> being on the line CD, and mark on this parallel the
                    point of interſection 7 ; ſlide the card down to the ſixth parallel, to which
                    tranſfer the point n⁰ 6. In like manner proceed with the other parallels.</p>
                <p>The point K, at the interſection of the line IK with</p>
                <p>the eighth parallel, is one point through which the eighth frame passes. From
                    this point upwards a curve is to be deſcribed ſo as to reconcile with the lower
                    part of this frame already deſcribed, and the upper part, forming an invented
                    arch, which is to terminate at H. This top-timber may be formed by two ſweeps,
                    whoſe radii and centres are to be determined partly from circumſtances and
                    partly according to fancy. It however may be more readily formed by hand.</p>
                <p>Let LM (fig. 27.) be the line of the second deck at the main frame, and let LN be
                    the difference of the draught of water, if any. Make GN (fig. 28.) equal to LN ;
                    draw NM perpendicular to GN, meeting the circle in M ; and through the points G
                    and M draw the parallels GV and MV ; divide GN as before, and from the ſeveral
                    points of diviſion draw perpendiculars terminating in the curve. Transfer theſe
                    perpendiculars from L upwards (fig. 27.), and through the points thus found draw
                    the lines 11, 22, &amp;c. parallel to LM. Apply a flip of card to the eighth
                    parallel, and mark upon it the point anſwering to the ſtem, the eighth and main
                    frames : carry this to the triangle, and place it ſo that theſe points may be on
                    the correſponding lines. Then the points of interſection of the lines C 7, C 6,
                    &amp;c. are to be marked on the card, which is now to be applied ſirſt to the
                    eighth parallel (fig. 27.), then to the ſeventh, &amp;c. transferring the
                    ſeveral points of diviſion in order as before.</p>
                <p>Draw the line HO (fig. 27.) ; mark its length on a flip of card, and apply it to
                    the triangle, ſo that it may be parallel to its base, and its extremities one on
                    the eighth and the other on the main frame : mark on the card the points of
                    interſection of the ſeveral intermediate lines as before ; then apply the card
                    to HO, and transfer the divisions.</p>
                <p>There are now three points determined through which each top-timber must paſs,
                    namely, one in the breadth ribband, one in the fifth, and one in the upper
                    ribband. Through theſe curves are to be deſcribed, ſo as to reconcile with the
                    lower part of the frame, and partake partly of the curvature of the eighth
                    frame, and partly of that of the main frame, but most of that of the frame to
                    which it is neareſt : and hence the plane of projection is ſo far finiſhed, that
                    it only remains to prove the ſeveral frames by water lines.</p>
                <p>Another method of deſcribing the frames in the body plan is by ſweeps. In this
                    method it is neceſſary, in the firſt place, to deſcribe the height of the
                    bιeadth lines, and the riſing of the floor, in the plane of elevation. The half
                    breadth lines are next to be deſcribed in the floor plan. The main frame is then
                    to be deſcribed by three or more ſweeps, and giving it ſuch a form as may be
                    most ſuitable to the ſervice the ſhip is designed for. The lower, upper, and
                    top-timber heights of breadth, and the riſings of the floor, are to be ſet upon
                    the middle line in the body plan, and the ſeveral half breadths are then to be
                    laid off on lines drawn through theſe points perpendicular to the middle line. A
                    mould may then be made for the main frame, and laid upon the ſeveral tilings, as
                    in whole mouldings, explained in Chapter V. with this difference, that here an
                    under breadth ſweep is deſcribed to paſs through the point which limits the half
                    breadth of the timber, the centre of which will be in the breadth Une of that
                    timber. The proper centres for all the frames being found, and<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0393.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0387"/> the arches
                    deſcribed, the bend mould muſt be ſo placed on the riſing line of the floor,
                    that the back of it may touch the back of the under breadth ſweep. But the
                    general practice is, to deſcribe all the floor ſweeps with compaſſes, as well as
                    the under breadth ſweeps, and to reconcile theſe two by a mould wſhich is an
                    arch of a circle, its radius being the same with that of the reconciling ſweep
                    by which the midſhip frame was formed. It is uſual for all the floor ſweeps to
                    be of the same radius ; and in order to find their centres a line is formed on
                    the floor plan for the half breadth of the floor. As this line cannot be
                    deſcribed on the ſurface of a ſhip, it is therefore only an imaginary line.
                    Instead of it ſome make uſe of a diagonal in the body plane to limit the half
                    breadth of the floor upon every rising line, and to erect perpendiculars at the
                    ſeveral interſections, in the lame manner as for the midſhip frame.</p>
                <p>After the ſweeps are all deſcribed, recpurſe is had to moulds, or some such
                    contrivance, to form the hollow of the timbers, much in the same manner as in
                    whole moulding ; and when all the timbers are formed, they muſt be proved by
                    ribband and water lines, and altered, it necessary, to make fair curves.</p>
                <p>The preceding methods of deſcribing the ſeveral planes or ſections of a ſhip
                    being well underſtood, it will be a very eaſy matter to conſtruct draughts for
                    any propoſed ſhip : and as the above planes were deſcribed ſeparately and
                    independent of each other, it is therefore of little conſequence which is firſt
                    deſcribed. In the following application, however, the plane oſ elevation will be
                    first drawn, then part of the floor plan, and lastly the body plan : and in
                    connecting theſe plans the most rational and simple methods will be
                    employed.</p>

                <p>In order that the top-timber line, may look fair on the bow, and to prevent the

                    ſheer from the round of the bow to the ſtem. For this puroſe the following
                    method is uſually employed : Produce the circular ſheer before the ſtem in the
                    plane of elevation at pleaſure ; then place a batton to the round of the bow in
                    the half breadth plan, and mark on it the ſtations of the ſquare timbers and the
                    side of the ſtem ; apply the batton to the ſheer plan, and place it to the ſheer
                    of the ſhip, keeping the ſtations of the timbers on the batton well with thoſe
                    on the ſheer plan for ſeveral timbers before dead-flat, where they will not
                    alter ; then mark the other timbers and the ſtem on the ſheer line produced ;
                    through theſe points draw lines parallel, to the keel, to interſect their
                    correſponding timbers and the ſtem. in the ſheer plan ; then a curve deſcribed
                    theſe last points will be the ſheer of the ſhip round the bow, lifted as
                    required : and the heights of the timbers thus lengthened are to be transferred
                    to the body- plan as before.</p>
                <p>Draw the line AB (fig. 32.) equal to 22 feet, the whole breadth ; from the middle

                    and CF equal to half that of the ſtem, and from the points A, E, F, B, draw
                    lines parallel to CD. Make AG, BG each equal to 14 feet, the height at the main
                    frame, and draw the line GG parallel to AB. Make GH, GH each equal to half a
                    foot, the difference between the main and top timber half breadths. From A and B
                    ſet up the heights of the lower and upper breadth lines to I and K, and draw the
                    ſtraight lines IK, IK. Let CL be the rising at the main frame, and ⊕, ⊕ the
                    extremities of the floor timber. Henca, as there are now five points determined
                    in each half of the main frame, it may be very eaſily deſcribed.</p>
                <p>Make CM equal to L⊕, join M⊕, and draw the other ribbands NO, PQ. In order,
                    however, to simplify this operation, the rectilineal diſtance ⊕I was triſected,
                    and through the points of diviſion the lines NO, PQ were drawn parallel to the
                    floor ribband M⊕.</p>
                <p>Take the diſtance <hi rend="italic">bc</hi> (fig. 30.), and lay it off from F to
                    (fig. 32.); alſo make Fb (fig. 32.) equal to Fu (fig. 30.) ; through <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> draw <hi rend="italic">b c</hi> parallel to AB, and
                    equal to FR (fig. 31). In like manner take the heights of each top-timber from
                    fig. 30. and lay them off from C towards D (fig. 32) ; through theſe points draw
                    lines parallel to AB, and make them equal each to each, to the correſponding
                    half breadth lines taken from the floor plan: Then through the ſeveral points
                        <hi rend="italic">a, c,</hi> amp;c thus found, draw a line a <hi
                        rend="italic">c</hi> H, which will be the projection of the top-timber line
                    of the fore body in the body plan. Proceed in the ſame manner to find the
                    top-timber line in the after body.</p>
                <p>Transfer the height of the main breadth line on the ſtem bl (fig. 30.) from F to
                    d (fig. 32). Transfer alſo the heights of the lower and upper breadth lines at
                    timber F (fig. 30. ), namely, FW, FX, from F to <hi rend="italic">e and f</hi>
                    (fig. 32.) ; through which draw the parallels <hi rend="italic">eg, fh</hi>;
                    make them equal to FS (fig. 31.), and draw the ſtraight line <hi rend="italic">g
                        h.</hi> In this manner proceed to lay down the portions of the extreme
                    breadth at each frame, both in the fore and in the after body in the body plan,
                    and draw the upper and lower breadth lines <hi rend="italic">dh</hi> K, <hi
                        rend="italic">dg</hi> I in the fore body and K i, I <hi rend="italic">i</hi>
                    in the after body. Hence the portions of the ſeveral top-timbers contained
                    between the top-timber and main breadth lines may be eaſily deſcribed. It was
                    before remarked that their forms were partly arbitrary. The midſhip top-timber
                    has generally a hollow, the form of which is left entirely to the artiſt, though
                    in ſome ſhips, eſpecially ſmall ones, it has none. It is the common practice to
                    make a mould for this hollow, either by a ſweep or ſome other contrivance, which
                    is produced considerably above the top-timber line, in a ſtraight line or very
                    near one; The midſhip top-timber is formed by this mould, which is ſo placed
                    that it breaks in four with the back of the upper breadth ſweep. The other
                    top-timbers are formed by the ſame mould, obſerving to place it ſo that the
                    ſtraight part of it may be parallel to the ſtraight part of the midſhip timber,
                    and moved up or down, ſtill keeping it in that direction till it juſt touches
                    the back of the upper breadth ſweep. Some conſtructors begin at the after
                    timber, after the mould is made for the mid- ſhip top-timber, becauſe they think
                    it easier to keep the ſtraight part of the mould parallel to this than to the
                    midſhip timber ; and by this means the top side is kept from winding. Others,
                    again, make a mark upon</p>
                <p>the mould where the breadth line of the midſhip timber croſſes it, and with the
                    ſame mould they form the after timber ; this will occasion the mark that was
                    made on the mould when at the main frame to fall below the breadth line of the
                    after timber, and therefore another mark is made at the height of the breadth
                    line at the after timber ; the ſtraight part of the mould is then laid obliquely
                    acroſs the breadth lines of the top-timbers, in ſuch a manner that it may
                    interſect the breadth line of the midſhip timber at one of theſe marks and the
                    breadth line of the after timber at the other mark ; then the ſeveral
                    interſections of the breadth lines of the timbers are marked upon the mould ;
                    which muſt now be ſo placed in forming each timber, that the proper mark may be
                    applied to its proper breadth, and it muſt be turned about ſo as juſt to touch
                    the upper breadth ſweep. Any of theſe methods may make a fair side, and they may
                    be eaſily proved by forming another intermediate half breadth line.</p>
                <p>The remaining parts of the frames may be deſcribed by either of the methods laid
                    down in Problems IX. and X. In order, however, to illuſtrate this ſtill farther,
                    it is thought proper to ſubjoin another method of forming the intermediate
                    frames, the facility of which will recommend it.</p>
                <p>Take FZ (fig. 30.), and lay it from F to <hi rend="italic">k</hi> (fig. 32.) ;

                    plane. Now transfer the ſeveral intervals of the frames contained between the
                    middle line and the ribbands (fig. 31.) to the correſponding ribbands in the
                    body plan (fig. 32). Hence there will be five points given in each frame,
                    namely, one at the lower breadth line, one at each ribband, and one at the keel
                    ; and conſequently theſe frames may be eaſily deſcribed. In order to exemplify
                    this, let it be required to lay down the frame E in the plane of projection.
                    Take the interval En (fig. 31.), and lay it from M to <hi rend="italic">u</hi>
                    (fig. 32). Lay off alſo E <hi rend="italic">v,</hi> Ee (fig. 31.) from N to <hi
                        rend="italic">v</hi> and ſrom P to n (fig. 32 ); then through the points F,
                        <hi rend="italic">u, v, n</hi> and the lower breadth line deſcribe a curve,
                    and it will be the repreſentation of the frame E in the body plan. In like
                    manner the other frames may be deſcribed.</p>
                <p>The ribbands may now be transferred from the body plan to the plane of elevation,
                    by taking the ſeveral heights of the interſection of each ribband with the
                    frames, and laying them off on the correſponding frames in the floor plan ; and
                    if the line drawn through theſe points make a fair curve, it is preſumed that
                    the curves of the frames are rightly laid down in the body plan. Only one of
                    theſe ribbands, namely, the firſt, is laid down in fig. 30. Theſe curves may
                    alſo be farther proved, by drawing water lines in the plane of ele<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0395.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0389"/>vation, and in
                    the body plan, at equal diſtances from the upper edge of the keel. Then the
                    diſtances between the middle line of the body plan, and the ſeveral points of
                    interſection of theſe lines with the frames, are to belaid off from the middle
                    line in the floor plan upon the correſponding frames ; and if the line drawn
                    through theſe points form a fair curve, the frames are truly drawn in the body
                    plan.</p>
                <p>In figs. 30. and 32. there are drawn four water lines at any equal diſtances from
                    the keel, and from each other. Theſe lines are then transferred from fig. 32. to
                    fig. 31; and the lines paſſing through theſe points make fair curves.</p>
                <p>The tranſoms are deſcribed by Problem VIII. it is therefore unnecessary to repeat
                    the proceſs. A riſing line of the floor timbers is commonly drawn in the plane
                    of elevation.</p>
                <p>As this is intended only as an introductory example, ſeveral particulars have
                    therefore been omitted ; which, however, will be exemplified in the following
                    ſection.</p>

                <p>As it is propoſed in this place to ſhow the method of deſcribing the plans of a

                    But as it would very much confuſe the figures to have a reference to every

                <p>Draw a ſtraight line (fig. 33.) to repreſent the upper edge of the keel, erect a
                    perpendicular on that end to the right, and from thence ſet off 1 82 feet, the
                    length on the gun-deck, and there erect another perpendicular ; that to the
                    right is called the <hi rend="italic">foremost</hi> per pendicular, and the
                    other the <hi rend="italic">after</hi> one : upon theſe two perpendiculars all
                    the foremoſt and aftermoſt heights must be ſet off, which are expreſſed in the
                    dimenſions.</p>
                <p>Then ſet off the diſtance of the main frame or dead flat from the foremoſt
                    perpendicular, and at that place erect a third perpendicular, which muſt be
                    diſtinguiſhed by the character ⊕. From dead flat the room and ſpace of all the
                    timbers muſt be ſet off ; but it will only be neceſſary to erect a perpendicular
                    at every frame timber ; which in the fore body are called <hi rend="italic">dead
                        flat,</hi> A, C, E, &amp;c. and in the afterbody (2), 1, 3, 5, &amp;c. :
                    hence the diſtance between the frame perpendiculars will be double the room and
                    ſpace expreſſed in the dimenſions. Then ſet off the heights of the gun-deck
                    afore at midſhip or dead flat, and abaft from the upper fide of the keel ; and a
                    curve deſcribed through theſe three points will be the upper side of the
                    gun-deck. Set off the thickneſs of the gun-deck plank below that ; and another
                    curve being drawn parallel to the former, the gun-deck will then be deſcribed at
                    the middle line of the ſheer plan.</p>
                <p>The centre of the stem is then to be laid down by means of the table of
                    dimenſions ; from which centre, with an extent equal to the neareſt diſtance of
                    the upper edge of the keel, deſcribe a circle upwards : describe alſo another
                    circle as much without the former as the ſtem is moulded. Then ſet off the
                    height of the head of the ſtem, with the diſtance afore the perpendicular, and
                    there make a point ; and within that ſet off the moulding of the ſtem, and there
                    make another point : from this laſt mentioned point let a line paſs downwards,
                    interſecting the perpendicular at the height of the gun- deck, and breaking in
                    fair with the inner circle, and the after part of the ſtern is drawn. Draw
                    another line from the foremoſt point downwards, parallel to the former, and
                    breaking in fair with the outer circle ; then the whole ſtem will be formed,
                    except the after or lower end, which cannot be determined till hereafter.</p>
                <p>The ſtern-poſt muſt be next formed. Set off on the upper edge of the keel a ſpot
                    for the aft part of the rabbet taken from the dimenſions, and from that forward
                    ſet off another point at the diſtance of the thickneſs of the plank of the
                    bottom, which is 4½ inches ; and from this laſt mentioned point draw a line

                    set up the perpendicular the height of the wing tranſom, and draw a level line,
                    and where that line interſects, the line firſt drawn will be the aft side of the
                    wing tranſom : on the upper, part of the middle line ſet off from that place the
                    diſtance of the aft side of the ſtern-poſt ; ſet off alſo the diſtance of the
                    after part from the rabbet on the upper edge of the keel, and a line drawn
                    through theſe two points will be the aft side of the poſt. A line drawn parallel
                    to the firſt drawn line at the diſtance of 4 ½ inches, the thickneſs of the
                    plank on the bottom, will be the aft side of the rabbet : and hence the
                    ſtern-poſt is deſcribed, except the head, which will be determined
                    afterwards.</p>
                <p>From the dimenſions take the ſeveral heights of the tipper deck above the
                    gun-deck, afore, at midſhip, and abaft, and ſet them off accordingly ; though
                    theſe points deſcribe a curve, which will be the under side of the upper deck ;
                    deſcribe alſo another curve parallel thereto, at the diſtance of the thickneſs
                    of the plank, and the upper deck will be then repreſented at the middle line of
                    the ſhip.</p>
                <p>Set off the height of the lower counter, at the middle line, from the upper edge
                    of the keel, and draw a horizontal line with a pencil ; then on the pencil line
                    ſet off the diſtance the touch of the lower counter is abaſt the aft side of the
                    wing tranſom : from this point to that where the fore part of the rabbet of the
                    ſtern- poſt interſects the line drawn for the upper part of the wing tranſom,
                    draw a curve at pleaſure, which curve will repreſent the lower counter at the
                    middle line. The height of the upper counter is then to be ſet off from the
                    upper edge of the keel, and a horizontal line is to be drawn as before, ſetting
                    off the diſtance the touch of the upper counter is abaft the aft side of the
                    wing tranſom ; and a curve deſcribed from thence to the touch of the lower
                    counter will form the upper counter at the middle line.</p>
                <p>Both counters being formed at the middle line, the upper part of the ſtern timber
                    above the counters is to be deſcribed as follows : On the level line drawn for
                    the upper side of the wing tranſom ſet off the diſtance of the aft side of the
                    ſtern timber at the middle line from the aft side of the wing tranſom, at the
                    height of the top- timber line, and erect a perpendicular : then upon this
                    perpendicular, from the upper edge of the keel, ſet off the height at the middle
                    line of the top-timber line at the after side of the ſtern timber ; through this
                    point draw a ſtraight line to the touch of the upper counter, and the upper part
                    of the ſtern timber will be deſcribed.</p>
                <p>As the ſtern rounds two ways, both up and aft, the stern timber at the side will
                    conſequently alter from that at the middle line, and therefore remains to be
                    repreſented. Take the round up of the upper counter from the dimenſions, and ſet
                    it below the touch at the middle, and with a pencil draw a level line ; take
                    alſo the round aft, and ſet it forward from the touch on the touch line, and
                    ſquare it down to the pencil line laſt drawn, and the point of interſection will
                    be the touch of the upper counter at the side. In the same manner find the touch
                    of the lower counter ; and a curve, similar to that at the middle line, being
                    deſcribed from the one touch to the other, will form the upper counter at the
                    side.</p>
                <p>Take the round up of the wing tranſom, and ſet it off below the line before drawn
                    for the height of the wing tranſom, and draw another horizontal line in pencil :
                    then take the round aft of the wing tranſom, and ſet it forward on the upper
                    line from the point repre- ſenting the aft side of the wing tranſom ; ſquare it
                    down to the lower line, and the interſection will be the touch of the wing
                    tranſom : then a curve, ſimilar to that at the middle line, being drawn from the
                    touch of the wing tranſom to the touch of the lower counter at the side, will be
                    the lower counter at the side. Draw a line from the upper counter upwards, and
                    the whole ſtern timber at the side will be repreſented. But as the ſtraight line
                    drawn for the upper part of the ſide timber ſhould not be parallel to that at
                    the middle line, its rake is therefore to be determined as follows.</p>
                <p>Draw a line at pleaſure, on which ſet off the breadth of the ſtern at the upper
                    counter ; at the middle of this line ſet off the round aft of the upper counter,
                    then through this point and the extremities of the ſtern deſcribe a curve. Now
                    take the breadth of the ſtern at the top-timber line, and through the point
                    where that breadth will interſect the curve for the round aft of the ſtern draw
                    a line parallel to that firſt drawn, and the diſtance from the line laſt drawn
                    to the curve at the middle of the fine is the diſtance that the ſide timber muſt
                    be from the middle line at the height of the top-timber line.</p>
                <p>The ſheer is to be deſcribed, which is done by ſetting off the heights afore, at
                    midſhips, and abaft, and a curve deſcribed through theſe three points will be
                    the ſheer. But in order that the ſheer may correſpond exactly with the
                    dimenſions laid down, it will be neceſſary to proceed as follows : The
                    perpendicular repreſenting timber dead flat being already drawn, ſet off from
                    that the diſtances of the other frame timbers, which is double the room and
                    ſpace, as the frames are only every other one ; and erect perpendiculars,
                    writing the name under each : then on each of theſe perpendiculars ſet off the
                    correſponding heights of the top- timber line taken from the table of dimenſions
                    for conſtructing the bodies ; and through theſe points a curve being deſcribed,
                    will repreſent the ſheer of the ſhip or top timber line agreeable to the
                    dimenſions.</p>
                <p>The quarter-deck and forecaſtle are next to be deſcribed, which may be done by
                    taking their reſpective heights and lengths from the dimenſions, and deſcribing
                    their curves. In the ſame manner alſo, the round- houſe may be drawn. The decks
                    being deſcribed repreſenting their heights at the middle, it is then necessary
                    to repreſent them alſo at the ſide. For thia purpoſe take the round of the decks
                    from the dimenſions, and ſet them off below the lower line drawn for the middle,
                    and a curve deſcribed both fore and aft, obſerving to let it be rather quicker
                    than the former, will be the repreſentation of the decks at the ſide.</p>
                <p>The ports come next under conſideration. In the placing of them due attention
                    muſt be paid, ſo as to preſerve ſtrength ; or that they ſhall be so dispoſed as
                    not to weaken the ſhip in the leaſt, which is often done by cutting off
                    principal timbers, placing them in too large openings, having too ſhort timbers
                    by the ſide of them, &amp;c. The frames repreſented by the lines already drawn
                    muſt be firſt conſulted. Then with a pencil draw two curves, for the lower and
                    upper parts of the lower deck poſts, parallel to the line representing the lower
                    deck ; the diſtances of theſe lines from<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0399.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0393"/> the deck are to be taken from the dimenſions,
                    obſerving, however, to add to theſe heights the thickneſg of the deck, as the
                    deck line at the side repreſents the under part of the deck.</p>
                <p>The foremoſt port is then to be deſcribed, observing to place it as far aft as to
                    give ſufficient room for the manger : the moſt convenient place will therefore
                    be to put it between the frames R and T, and equally diſtant from each. It will
                    then be placed in the moſt conſpicuous point of ſtrength, as it will have a long
                    top-timber on the aft side and a long fourth futtock on the fore ſide of it. The
                    ſecond port may be placed in like manner between the next two frames, which will
                    be equally well ſituated for ſtrength as the former ; and by proceeding in this
                    manner, the ports on the gun-deck may alſo be placed, taking care to have two
                    frames between every two ports, all fore and aft.</p>
                <p>The upper deck ports are then to be deſcribed ; and in order to diſpoſe of them
                    in the ſtrongeſt ſituation poſſible, they muſt be placed over the middle between
                    the gun-deck ports, ſo that every frame in the ſhip will run up to the top of
                    the ſide, by their coming between a gun and upper deck port ; and every port
                    will be between the frames, which will in a great meaſure contribute towards the
                    ſtrength of the ſhip. With regard to the ports on the quarter deck, it is not of
                    ſuch material conſequence if they cut the head of the frame, as in placing them
                    the ſituation of the dead eyes muſt be conſidered, placing a port where there is
                    a vacancy between the dead eyes large enough to admit of one ; observing always
                    to place them as nearly as poſſible at equal diſtances from each other ; and
                    where it happens that they do not fall in the wake of a frame, then that frame
                    muſt by all means be carried up to the top of the ſide.</p>
                <p>The neceſſary length of the round houſe being determined in the dimenſions, it
                    may be ſet off ; obſervmg, however, to let it be no longer than is juſt
                    ſufficient for the neceſſary accommodations, as the ſhorter the round-houſe the
                    works abaft may be kept lower, and a low ſnug ſtern is always accounted the
                    handſomeſt. Then ſet off the round of the deck at the foremoſt end, below the
                    line drawn ; the deck at the ſide may be deſcribed by another curve drawn quite
                    aft. Now, from the point for the round of the deck to the ſtern timber, draw a
                    curve parallel to the top-timber line, and that will be the extreme height of
                    the top of the ſide abaft, which height continues to range fair along to the
                    foremoſt end of the round houſe, and at that place may have a fall about 14
                    inches, which may be turned off with a drift ſcroll. At the fore part of the
                    quarterdeck, the topſide may have a riſe of 14 inches, which may alſo be turned
                    off with a ſcroll. But as the raiſing of the topſide only 14 inches at that
                    place will not be ſuſſicient to unite with the heights abaft, it will therefore
                    be neceſſary to raiſe 14 inches more upon that, and break it off with a ſcroll
                    inverted on the firſt ſcroll, and continue theſe two lines, parallel to the
                    top-timber line, to the diſtance of about ſeven feet aft. At the foremoſt end of
                    the round-houſe there is a break of 14 inches already mentioned ; and in order
                    to make that part uniform with the breaks at the foremoſt end of the
                    quarter-deck, there muſt be ſet down 14 inches more below the former ; and at
                    theſe two heights continue two</p>
                <p>curves parallel to the top-timber line, from the aft part of the ſtern to the
                    ends of the two curves already drawn at the foremoſt end of the quarter deck. If
                    they ſhould happen not to break in fair with them, they must be turned off with
                    a round ; but to make them appear more handſome, the lower line may be turned
                    off with a ſcroll. Theſe lines being drawn will repreſent the upper edges of the
                    rails.</p>
                <p>The height of the top side at the fore part of the ſhip muſt next be conſidered;
                    which, in order to give proper height for the forecaſtle, muſt have a rise there
                    of 14 inches, the break being at the after end of the fore-caſtle, and turned
                    off as before. But as this part of the ſhip is ſtill conſiderably lower than the
                    after part, it will be necessary to give another of eight inches upon the
                    former, and turn it off with a ſcroll inverted. Hence this part of the ſhip will
                    appear more uniform to the after part.</p>
                <p>The finiſhing parts, namely the wales, ſtern, head, rails, &amp;c. remain to be
                    deſcribed. The wales may be firſt drawn ; and as the ſtrength of the ſhip
                    depends very much on the right placing of them, great care muſt therefore be
                    taken that they may be as little as poſſible wounded by the lower deck ports,
                    and ſo placed that the lower deck bolts ſhall bolt in them, and alſo that they
                    come as near as poſſible on the broadest part of the ſhip. In the firſt place,
                    therefore, the height of breadth lines muſt be choſen for our guide. Theſe
                    heights of breadth are to be taken from the dimenſions, and ſet off on the
                    respective frames, and curves drawn through theſe points will be the upper and
                    lower heights of breadth lines. The height of the wales may now be determined ;
                    which in general is in ſuch a manner that the upper height of breadth line comes
                    about six inches below their upper edge, and the wales are then placed right
                    upon the breadth lines. Take the heights and breadths of the wales afore, at
                    midſhips, and abaft from the table of dimenſions ; draw curves through the
                    points thus found, and the wales will be repreſented.</p>
                <p>The channel wales are then to be deſcribed. They are principally intended to
                    ſtrengthen the top side, and muſt be placed between the lower and upper deck
                    ports ; and the lower edge of them at midſhips ſhould be placed as low as
                    poſſible, in order to prevent them from being cut by the upper deck ports afore
                    and abaft. Take their heights and breadths from the dimenſions ; lay them off,
                    and deſcribe curves through the correſponding points, and the channel wales will
                    be repreſented.</p>
                <p>Lay off the dimenſions of the waste rail found in the table ; and through the
                    points draw a line parallel to the top-timber line all fore and aft. This rail
                    terminates the lower part of the paint work in the top side, as all the work
                    above this rail is generally painted, and the work of the top side below it
                    payed with a varniſh, except the main wales, which are always payed with
                    pitch.</p>
                <p>Take the draught of water from the dimensions, and draw the load water-line,
                    which is always done in green. Divide the diſtance between the load water-line
                    and the upper edge of the keel into five equal parts, and through theſe points
                    draw four more water-lines.</p>
                <p>Set off the centres of the masts on the gun-deck ; their rake may likewise be
                    taken from the dimenſions. Set off alſo the centre of the bowſprit, letting it
                        be<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0400.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0394"/> four
                    feet from the deck at the after part of the ſtem, which will give ſufficient
                    height for a light and airy figure.</p>
                <p>Draw the knight-heads ſo as to be ſufficiently high above the bowſprit to admit
                    of a chock between them for the better ſecurity of the bowſprit. The timber
                    heads may alſo be drawn above the forecaſtle, obſerving to place the most
                    convenient for the timbers of the frame, being thoſe which come over the upper
                    deck ports, as they may be allowed long enough to form handsome heads. There
                    ſhould be one placed abaft the cat-head, to which the foremoſt block is to be
                    bolted, and there may be two ports on the forecaſtle formed by them, and placed
                    where it is moſt convenient to the dead eyes.</p>
                <p>Deſcribe the channels, taking them lengths and thickneſſes from the dimenſions,
                    and place their upper edges well with the lower edge of the ſheer rail. The dead
                    eyes may then be drawn, obſerving to place them in ſuch a manner that the chains
                    may not interfere with the ports ; and the preventer plates muſt all be placed
                    on the channel wales, letting them be of ſuch a length that the preventer bolt
                    at each end may bolt on each edge of the channel wales. It muſt alſo be obſerved
                    to give each of the chains and preventer plates a proper rake, that is, to let
                    them lie in the direction of the ſhrouds, which may be done in the following
                    manner : Produce the mast upwards, upon which ſet off the length of the maſt to
                    the lower part of the head ; theſe ſtraight lines drawn from that point through
                    the centre of each dead eye will give the direction of the chains and preventer
                    braces.</p>
                <p>The senders may be then drawn, obſerving to place them right abreaſt of the main
                    hatchway, in order to prevent the ſhip’s side from being hurt by whatever may be
                    hoiſted on board. The proper place for them will therefore be at timber 3 ; and
                    the distance between them may be regulated by the diſtance between the ports.
                    The cheſt-tree may alſo be drawn, which muſt be placed at a proper diſtance
                    abaft the foremaſt, for the conveniency of hauling home the fore tack. It may
                    therefore be drawn at the aft side of timber C, from the top of the side down to
                    the upper edge of the channel wales ; and the fenders may reach from the top of
                    the fide down to the upper edge of the main wales. As the fenders and cheſt-tree
                    are on the outſide of the planks, wales, &amp;c. the lines repreſenting the
                    wales, &amp;c. ſhould not be drawn through them.</p>
                <p>Draw the ſteps on the side, which muſt be at the fore part of the main drift or
                    break, making them as long as the diſtance between the upper and lower deck
                    ports will admit of. They may be about six inches aſunder, and five inches deep,
                    and continued from the top of the side down to the middle of the main wales.</p>
                <p>In order to deſcribe the head, the height of the beak- head muſt be firſt
                    determined, which may be about two feet above the upper deck. At that place draw
                    a horizontal line, upon which ſet off the length of the beak-head, which may be
                    7 ½ feet abaft the fore part of the ſtem, and from thence ſquare a line up to
                    the forecaſtle deck ; which line will repreſent the aft part of the beak-head,
                    and will likewiſe terminate the foremoſt end of the forecaſtle. The length of
                    the head may now be determined, which by the proportions will be found to be 15
                    feet six inches from the fore part of the ſtem. Set it off from</p>
                <p>the fore part of the ſtem, and erect a perpendicular, which will be the utrnoſt
                    limits of the figure forward : them take the breadth of the figure from the
                    proportions, whhich is four feet four inches, and set it off forward ; and
                    another perpendicular being drawn will ſhow the utmoſt extent of the hair
                    bracket forward, or aft part of the figure. Then draw the lower cheek, letting
                    the upper edge be welll with the upper edge of the main wales, and the after end
                    ranging well with the beak-head line ; ſet off the depth of it on the ſtem;
                    which is about 11 inches, and let a ccurved line paſs from the after end through
                    the point on the ſtem, and to break in fair with the perpendiculaar firſt drawn
                    for the length of the head, the fore part of the curve will then repreſent the
                    poſition of the figure..</p>
                <p>The upper cheek may be next drawn ; but, in order to know the exact place of it
                    on the ſtem, the place of the main rail muſt firſt be ſet off on the ſtem, the
                    upper edge of which may be kept on a level with the beak-head ; then ſetting off
                    the depth of it below that, the place for the upper cheek may be determined,
                    letting it be exactly in the middle between that and the : lower cheek : then,
                    by drawing curves for the upper and lower edges of the cheek from the after end
                    parallel to the lower cheek, to break in fair with the perpendicular, drawn for
                    the back of the figure : then the upper cheek , will be formed. The upper part
                    may run in a ſerpentine as high as where the ſhoulder of the figure is suppoſed
                    to come, at which place it may be turned of with a ſcroll. The diſtance from the
                    ſcroll to the heel of the figure is called the hair-bracket.</p>
                <p>The head of the block may be formed by continuing the line at the breaſt round to
                    the top of the hair-bracket, obſerving to keep the top of it about six inches
                    clear of the under side of the bowſprit.</p>
                <p>Having the diſtance ſet off on the ſtem for placing the main rail, it may next be
                    deſcribed, keeping the bag of it as level as poſſible for the conveniency of the
                    gratings, and letting the foremoſt end riſe gradually according to the riſe of
                    the upper cheek and hair-bracket, ancd may turn off on the round of the ſcroll
                    before drawn for the hair-bracket. To form the after end, ſet off the ſize of
                    the head of the rail abaft the beak-head line, and erect a perpendicular ; then
                    deſcribe the arch of a circle from that perpendicular to break in fair with the
                    : lower side of the rail in the middle, and alſo another from the beak-head
                    perpendicular, to break in fair with the upper side of the rail at the middle,
                    obſerving to continue the head of it ſufficiently high to range with the timber
                    heads above the forecaſtle.</p>
                <p>The head timbers are next to be drawn, placing the ſtem timber its own thickneſs
                    abaft the ſtem, and the ſoremoſt muſt be ſo placed that the fore side may be up
                    andd down with the heel of the block or figure, which has not yet been ſet off.
                    Take therefore the diſtance from the breaſt to the heel on a ſquare which is
                    ſeven fet, and erect a perpendicular from the lower part of the lower cheek to
                    the lower part of the upper cheek ; which perpendicular will terminate the
                    foremoſt end of thee lower cheek and the heel of the figure, and will alſo
                    terminate the lower end of the hair-bracket : then, by continuing the ſame
                    perpendicular from the upper ppart of the lower deck to the under part of the
                    main rail, the fore side of the foremoſt head timber will be deſcribed ; and by
                    ſetting off its thickneſs aft, the other side may be drawn. The middle head
                    timber may be ſpaced between the two former ones ; and there may alſo be one<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0401.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0395"/> timber placed
                    abaft the ſtem, at a diſtance from the stem, equal to that between the others,
                    and the lower end of it may step on the upper edge of the lower rail.</p>
                <p>To deſcribe the middle and lower rails, divide the diſtance between the lower
                    part of the main rail and the upper part of the upper cheek equally at every
                    head timber ; and curves being deſcribed through theſe points will form the
                    middle and lower rails. The after end of the lower rail muſt terminate at the
                    after edge of the after head timber.</p>
                <p>The cat head ought to be repreſented in ſuch a manner as to come againſt the aft
                    side of the head of the main rail, to rake forward four inches in a foot, and to
                    ſteeve up 5 ½ inches in a foot, and about one foot six inches ſquare. The lower
                    part of it comes on the plank of the deck at the side, and the ſupporter under
                    it muſt form a fair curve to break in with the after end of the middle rail.</p>
                <p>The hawſe holes muſt come between the cheeks, which is the moſt convenient place
                    for them ; but their place fore and aft cannot be exactly determined until they
                    are laid down in the half-breadth plan.</p>
                <p>The knee of the head is to project from the breaſt of the figure about two
                    inches; and particular care muſt be taken that in forming it downwards it be not
                    too full, as it is then liable to rub the cable very much : it may therefore
                    have no more ſubſtance under the lower cheek at the heel of the figure than is
                    just ſufficient to admit of the bobſtay holes, and maybe 3⅛ feet diſtant from
                    the ſtem at the load water-line, making it run in an agreeable serpentine line
                    from the breaſt down to the third water line, where it may be 1 ½ feet from the
                    ſtem. By continuing the same line downwards, keeping it more dictant from the
                    ſtem as it comes down, the <hi rend="italic">gripe</hi> will be formed. The
                    lower part of it muſt break in fair with the under part of the falſe keel ; and
                    the breadth of the gripe at the broadeſt place will be found by the proportions
                    to be 4 ½ feet. As the aft part of the gripe is terminated by the fore foot, or
                    foremoſt end of the keel, it will now be proper to finiſh that part as follows :
                    From the line repreſenting the upper edge of the keel ſet down the depth of the
                    keel, through which draw a line parallel to the former, and it will be the lower
                    edge of the keel. From that point, where the aft side of the ſtem is diſtant
                    from the upper edge of the keel by a quantity equal to the breadth of the keel
                    at midſhips, erect a perpendicular, which will limit the foremoſt end of the
                    keel ; and the after or lower end of the ſtem may be repreſented by ſetting off
                    the length of the ſcarf from the foremoſt end of the keel, which may be six
                    feet. Set down from the line repreſenting the lower edge of the keel the
                    thickneſs of the falſe keel, which is ſeven inches ; and a line drawn through
                    that point parallel to the lower edge of the keel will be the under edge of the
                    falſe keel, the foremoſt end of which may be three inches afore the foremoſt end
                    of the main keel.</p>
                <p>The head being now finiſhed, proceed next to the ffern, the side and middle
                    timbers of which are already drawn. From the side timber ſet off forward 14
                    feet, the length of gallery, and draw a pencil line parallel to the side timber
                    ; draw alſo a line to interſect the touch of the upper counter at the side,
                    producing it forwards parallel to the ſheer as far as the pencil line first
                    drawn;</p>
                <p>and this line will repreſent the upper edge of the gallery rim. From which ſet
                    down eight inches, the breadth of the gallery rail, and draw the lower edge of
                    the rail. At the diſtance of eight inches from the fore side of the side timber
                    draw a line parallel thereto ; and from the point of interſection of this line
                    with the upper edge of the gallery rim, draw a curve to the middle timber
                    parallel to the touches of the upper counter, which line will repreſent the
                    upper edge of the upper counter rail as it appears on the ſheer draught. The
                    lower edge of this rail may be formed by ſetting off its depth from the upper
                    edge. In the ſame manner the lower counter rail may be deſcribed : then take the
                    diſtance between that and the upper counter rail, and ſet it off below the rim
                    rail ; and hence the rail that comes to the lower stool may be drawn, keeping it
                    parallel to the rim rail. Underneath that, the lower finiſhing may be formed,
                    making it as light and agreeable as poſſible.</p>
                <p>Set off from the middle timber on the end of the quarter-deck the projection of
                    the balcony, which may be about 2 feet, and draw a line with a pencil parallel
                    to the middle timber. On this line ſet off a point 1½ inches below the under
                    side of the quarter-deck, from which draw a curve to the side timber parallel to
                    the upper counter rail, which curve will repreſent the lower side of the foot
                    ſpace rail of the balcony as it appears in the ſheer draught.</p>
                <p>Take the diſtance between the point of interſection of the upper edge of the
                    upper counter with the middle line, and the point of interſection of the under
                    side of the foot ſpace rail with the middle line, which ſet up on a
                    perpendicular from the upper edge of the rim rail at the foremoſt end. Through
                    this point draw a line parallel to the rim rail to interſect the lower part of
                    the foot ſpace rail, and this line will repreſent the lower edge of the rail
                    that comes to the middle ſtool, and will anſwer to the foot ſpace rail. Then
                    between this line and the rim rail three lights or ſaſhes may be drawn, having a
                    muntin or pillar between each light of about 14 inches broad, and the lower
                    gallery will be finiſhed. Set off the depth of the middle ſtool rail above the
                    line already drawn for the lower edge, and the upper edge may be drawn. Then ſet
                    off the ſame depth above the curve drawn for the lower edge of the foot ſpace
                    rail, and the upper edge of that rail may then be drawn.</p>
                <p>The quarter-piece muſt be next deſcribed, the heel of which muſt ſtep on the
                    after end of the middle ſtool. Draw a line with a pencil parallel to the middle
                    timber, and at a diſtance therefrom, equal to the projection of the balcony.
                    Upon this line ſet up from the round houſe deck the height of the upper part of
                    the ſtern or taff rail, which may be four feet above the deck. At that height
                    draw with a pencil a horizontal line, and from its interſection with the line
                    firſt drawn deſcribe a curve to the middle ſtool rail, obſerving to make the
                    lower part of this curve run nearly parallel to the side timber, and the lower
                    part about three inches abaft the side timber ; and this curve will repreſent
                    the aft side of the quarter-piece at the outſide. There ſet off the thickneſs of
                    the quarter-piece, which is one foot six inches, afore the curve already drawn ;
                    and another curve being deſcribed parallel to it from the lower part to the top
                    of the ſheer, and the quarter-piece<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0402.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0396"/> at the outſide will be represented. On the
                    horizontal line drawn for the upper part of the taff-rail ſet off forward the
                    thickneſs of the taff-rail, which is one foot; then draw a curve down to the
                    head of the quarterpiece parallel to the first, and that part of the taff-rail
                    will be deſcribed. Inſtead of a fair curve, it is cuſtomary to form the upper
                    part of the taff-rail with one or two breaks, and their curves inverted. Either
                    way may, however, be uſed according to fancy.</p>
                <p>Set off the depth of the tail rail, which may be about 3 ½ feet, on the line
                    drawn for the projection ; from the upper part, and from this point, deſcribe a
                    curve as low as the heel of the quarter-piece, and about five inches abaft it at
                    that place ; obſerving to make it run nearly parallel to the after edge of the
                    quarter-piece ; and the after part of the quarter-piece, which comes neareſt to
                    the side, will be repreſented.</p>
                <p>Set up on the line drawn for the projection of the balcony the height of the
                    upper part of the balcony or breaſt rail, which is 3 ½ feet from the deck ; ſet
                    off the thickneſs of the rail below that, and deſcribe the balcony, keeping it
                    parallel to the foot ſpace rail, and terminating it at the line drawn for the
                    after part of the quarter-piece neareſt the side ; and the whole balcony will
                    then be repreſented.</p>
                <p>The upper gallery is then to be deſcribed; In order to this, its length muſt be
                    determined, which may be 11 feet. Set off this diſtance from the side timber
                    forward with the ſheer ; and at this point draw a line parallel to the side
                    timber, which line will repreſent the fore part of the gallery. Then take the
                    diſtance between the upper part of the foot ſpace rail and the upper part of the
                    breaſt rail on a perpendicular, and ſet it off on a perpendicular from the upper
                    part of the middle ſtool rail on the line drawn for the fore part of the
                    gallery, from which to the fore part of the quartet- piece draw a ſtraight line
                    parallel to the rail below, which line will be the upper edge of the upper rim
                    rail; and its thickneſs being ſet off, the lower edge may alſo be drawn. From
                    the upper edge of that rail ſet up an extent equal to the diſtance between the
                    lower rim rail and middle ſtool rail, and deſcribe the upper ſtool rail, the
                    after end of which will be determined by the quarter piece, and the lore end by
                    the line for the length of the gallery. There may be three ſaſhes drawn between
                    theſe two rails as before ; and hence the upper gallery will be formed.</p>
                <p>The upper finiſhing ſhould be next drawn, the length of which may be 1½ foot leſs
                    than the upper gallery. Draw a line parallel to the rake of the ſtern for the
                    fore end of it, and let the upper part of the top side be the upper part of the
                    upper rail, from which ſet down three inches for the thickneſs of the rail, and
                    deſcribe it. Deſcribe alſo another rail of the ſame length and thickneſs as the
                    former, and eight inches below ; from the end of which a ſerpentine line may be
                    drawn down to the upper ſtool rail, and the upper finiſhing will be
                    completed.</p>
                <p>The ſtern being now finiſhed, the rudder only remains to be drawn. The breadth of
                    the rudder at the lower part is to be determined from the proportions, and ſet
                    off from the line repreſenting the aft part of the ſtern- poſt ; which line alſo
                    repreſents the fore part of the redder. Then determine on the lower hance,
                    letting it be no higher than is juft ſufficient, which may be about</p>
                <p>one foot above the load water-line, and ſet off its breadth at that place taken
                    from the proportions. Then a line drawn from thence to the breadth ſet off at
                    the lower part will be the aft side of the rudder below the lower hance. There
                    may alſo be another hance about the height of the lower deck. The uſe of theſe
                    breaks or hances is to reduce the breadth as it riſes toward the head. The aft
                    part may be drawn above the lower hance, the break at the lower hance being
                    about ten inches, and the break at the upper hance six inches.— The back may be
                    then drawn. It is of elm, about four inches thick on the aft part. That
                    thickneſs being ſet off, and a line drawn from the lower hance to the lower end,
                    will repreſent the back. The head of the rudder ſhould be as high as to receive
                    a tiller above the upper deck. Therefore ſet off the size of the head above the
                    upper deck, and draw a line from thence to the break at the upper hance, and the
                    aft part of the rudder will be repreſented all the way up. The bearding ſhould
                    be drawm, by ſetting off the breadth of it at the keel from the fore side of the
                    rudder, which may be nine inches. Set off alſo the breadth at the head of the
                    wing tranſom, which may be a foot. Then a line being drawn through theſe two
                    points, from the lower part of the rudder to about a foot above the wing
                    tranſom, and the bearding will be repreſented. As the bearding is a very nice
                    point, and the working of the rudder depending very much upon it, it ſhould
                    always be very particularly considered. It has been cuſtomary to beard the
                    rudder to a ſharp edge at the middle line, by which the main piece is reduced
                    more than necessary. The rudder ſhould, however, be bearded from the side of the
                    pintles, and the fore side made to the form of the pintles.</p>
                <p>The pintles and braces may next be drawn. In order to which determine the place
                    of the upper one, which muſt be ſo diſpoſed that the ſtraps ſhall come round the
                    head of the ſtandard, which is againſt the head of the ſtern-poſt on the
                    gun-deck, and meet at the middle line. By this means there is double ſecurity
                    both to the brace and ſtandard. To obtain thoſe advantages, it muſt therefore be
                    placed about four inches above the wing tranſom ; the ſecond muſt be placed just
                    below the gun-deck so as to bolt in the middle of the deck tranſom, and the reſt
                    may be ſpaced equally between the lower one, which may be about six inches above
                    the upper edge of the keel. The number of them are generally ſeven pair upon
                    this claſs of ſhips; but the number may be regulated by the diſtance between the
                    ſecond and upper one, making the diſtance between the reſt nearly the ſame. The
                    length of all the braces will be found by ſetting off the length of the lower
                    one, which may be eight feet aſore the back of the ſtern-poſt, and also the
                    length of the third, which is four feet and a half afore the back of the
                    ſtern-poſt ; and a line drawn from the one extremity to the other will limit the
                    intermediate ones, as will appear on the ſheer draught. The braces will ſeem to
                    diminiſh in length very much as they go up ; but when measured or viewed on the
                    ſhape of the body, they will all be nearly of an equal length. The length of the
                    ſtraps of the pintles which come upon the rudder may all be within four inches
                    of the aft side of the rudder ; and the rudder being a flat ſurface, they will
                    all appear of the proper lengths.</p>

                    muſt be firſt drawn. Then produce the lower edge of the keel both ways, and let
                    it alſo repreſent the middle line of the half-breadth plan. Produce all the
                    frames downwards, and alſo the fore and after perpendiculars. Then from the
                    place in the sheer- plan, where the height of breadth-lines interſect the stem,
                    ſquare down to the middle line the fore and aft part of the rabbet and the fore
                    part of the ſtem. Take from the dimenſions what the ſtem is ſided at that place,
                    and ſet off half of it from the middle line in the half-breadth plan, through
                    which draw a line parallel to the middle line through the three lines ſquared
                    down, and the half-breadth of the ſtem will be repreſented in the half-breadth
                    plan. Take the thickneſs of the plank of the bottom, which is 4 ½ inches, and
                    deſcribe tbe rabbet of the ſtem in the half-breadth plan.</p>
                <p>From the points of interſection of the height of breadth lines with the counter
                    timber at the ſide, and with the counter timber at the middle line, draw lines
                    perpendicular to the middle line of the half-breadth plan, from which ſet off
                    the half breadth of the counter on the line firſt drawn; and from this point to
                    the interſection of the line laſt drawn, with the middle line draw a curve, and
                    the half breadth of the counter will be repreſented at the height of breadth,
                    which will be the broadeſt part of the ſtern.</p>
                <p>Take the main half breadth of timber dead flat from the dimenſions, and lay it
                    off from the middle line on dead flat in the half-breadth plan. Take alſo from
                    the dimenſions the main half breadth of every timber, and ſet off each from the
                    middle line on the correſponding timbers in the half-breadth plan. Then a curve
                    drawn from the end of the line repreſenting the half breadth of the counter
                    through all the points, ſet off on the timbers, and terminating at the aft part
                    of the ſtern, will be the main half breadth line. Take from the dimenſions the
                    top-timber half breadth, and deſcribe the top- timber half-breadth line in the
                    half-breadth plan, in the same manner as the main half-breadth line.</p>
                <p>Take from the dimenſions the half breadth of the riſing, and ſet it off from the
                    middle line on the correſponding timbers in the half-breadth plan, obſerving,
                    where the word <hi rend="italic">outside</hi> is expreſſed in the tables, the
                    half breadth for that timber muſt be ſet off above or on the outſide of the
                    middle line. Then a curve drawn through theſe points will be the half breadth of
                    riſing in the half-breadth plan.</p>
                <p>It will now be neceſſary to proceed to the body plan. Draw a horizontal line
                    (fig. 35.), which is called the <hi rend="italic">baſe line,</hi> from the right
                    hand extremity of which erect a perpendicular. Then ſet off on the baſe line the
                    main half breadth at dead flat, and erect another perpendicular, and from that
                    ſet off the main half breadth again, and erect a third perpendicular. The firſt
                    perpendicular, as already obſerved, is called the ſide line of the fore body ;
                    the ſecond the middle line ; and the third the ſide line of the after body.</p>
                <p>Take from the dimenſions the heights of the diagonals up the middle line, and ſet
                    them from the baſe up the middle line in the body plan. Take alſo their
                    diſtances from the middle line on the baſe, and ſet them off. Set off alſo their
                    heights up the ſide lines, and draw the diagonals. Then take from the ſheer plan
                    the heights of the lower height of breadth line, and ſet them off upon the
                    middle line in the body plan ; through theſe</p>
                <p>points lines are to be drawn parallel to the baſe, and terminating at the ſide
                    lines. In like manner proceed with the upper height of breadth line.</p>
                <p>The riſing is next to be ſet off on the body plan ; it muſt, however, be firſt
                    deſcribed in the ſheer plan :</p>
                <p>Take, therefore, the heights from the dimenſions, and ſet them off on the
                    correſponding timbers in the ſheer plan, and a curve deſcribed through theſe
                    points will be the riling line in the ſheer plan. Then take from the dimenſions
                    the riſing heights of dead flat. Set it off in the body plan, and draw a
                    horizontal line. Now take all the riſing heights from the ſheer plan, and ſet
                    them off in the body plan from the lint drawn for the riſing height of dead
                    flat, and draw horizontal linea through theſe points. Take from the half-breadth
                    plan the half breadths of the riſing, and ſet them off from the middle line in
                    the body plan, and the centres of the floor sweeps of the correſponding timbers
                    will be obtained.</p>
                <p>From the half-breadth plan take the main half- breadth lines, and ſet them off
                    from the middle line in the body plan on the correſponding lines before drawn
                    for the lower height of breadth ; and from the extremities of theſe lines ſet
                    off towards the middle line the lengths of the lower breadth ſweeps
                    reſpectively.</p>
                <p>Take from the dimenſions the diſtance of each frame from the middle line on the
                    diagonals, and ſet them off from the middle line on their reſpective diagonal
                    lines. Now theſe diſtances being ſet off, and the lower breadth and floor ſweeps
                    deſcribed, the ſhape of the frames below the breadth line may eaſily be drawn as
                    follows : Place one point of a compaſs in the diſtance ſet off for the length of
                    the lower breadth ſweep, and extend the other to the point which terminates the
                    breadth, and deſcribe an arch of a circle downwards, which will interſect the
                    points ſet off on the upper diagonal lines, letting it paſs as low as
                    convenient. Then fix one point of the compasses in the centre of the floor
                    ſweep, and extend the other to the point ſet off on the fourth diagonal, which
                    is the floor head ; and deſcribe a circle to interſect as many of the points ſet
                    off on the diagonals as it will. Then draw a curve from the back of the lower
                    breadth ſweep, through the points on the diagonals, to the back of the floor
                    ſweep. Deſcribe alſo another curve from the back of the floor ſweep through the
                    points on the lower diagonals, and terminating at the upper part of the rabbet
                    of the keel, and that part of the frame below the breadth will be formed. In
                    like manner deſcribe the other frames.</p>
                <p>Through the extremities of the frames at the lower height of breadth draw lines
                    parallel to the middle line, and terminating at the upper height of breadth
                    line, and from thence ſet off the upper breadth ſweeps; now fix one point of the
                    compaſs in the centres of the upper breadth ſweeps ſucceſſively, and the other
                    point to the extremities of the frames, and deſcribe circles upwards. Then from
                    the ſheer plan take off the heights of the top-timber lints, and ſet them off in
                    the body plan, drawing horizontal lines ; upon which ſet off the top-timber half
                    breadths taken from the correſponding timbers in thé half-breadth plan ; and by
                    deſcribing curves from the back of the upper breadth ſweeps through the points
                    ſet off on the ſeventh or upper diagonal ; and interſecting the top-timber half
                    breadths, the timbers will then be formed from the<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0404.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0398"/> keel to the
                    top of the side, The upper end of the timbers may be determined by taking the
                    ſeveral heights of the upper part of the top side above the top-timber line, and
                    ſetting them off above the top- timber line on the correſponding timbers in the
                    body plan. The lower parts of the timbers are ended at the rabbet of the keel as
                    follows : With an extent of 4 ½ inches, the thickneſs of the bottom, and one leg
                    of the compaſſes at the place where the line for the thickneſs of the keel
                    intersects the baſe line ; with the other leg deſcribe an arch to interſect the
                    keel line and the baſe. Then six one point at the interſection of the arch and
                    keel, and from the point of interſection of the keel and baſe deſcribe another
                    arch to interſect the former. Then from the interſection of theſe arches draw
                    one ſtraight line to the interſection of the keel and baſe, and another to the
                    interſection of the lower arch and the keel, and the rabbet of the keel will be
                    deſeribed at the main frame. All the timbers in the middle part of the ſhip
                    which have no riſing terminate at the interſection of the upper edge of the
                    rabbet with the baſe line ; but the lower part of the timbers, having a riſing,
                    end in the centre of the rabbet, that is, where the two circles interſect. Thoſe
                    timbers which are near the after end of the keel must be ended by ſetting off
                    the half-breadth of the keel at the port in the half- breadth plan, and describe
                    the tapering of the keel. Then at the correſponding timbers take off the
                    half-breadth of the keel ; ſet it off in the body plan, and deſcribe the rabbet
                    as before, letting every timber end where the two circles for its reſpective
                    rabbet interſect.</p>
                <p>To deſcribe the side counter or ſtern timber, take the height of the wing
                    tranſom, the lower counter, upper counter, and top-timber line at the side ;
                    from the ſheer plan transfer them to the body plan, and through theſe points
                    draw horizontal lines. Divide the diſtance between the wing tranſom and lower
                    counter into three equal parts, and through the two points of diviſion draw two
                    horizontal lines. Draw alſo a horizontal line equidiſtant from the upper counter
                    and the top-timber line in the ſheer plan, and transfer them to the body
                    plan.</p>
                <p>Now, from the point of interſection of the aft side of the ſtern timber at the
                    side, with the wing tranſom at the side in the ſheer plan, draw a line
                    perpendicular to the middle line in the half-breadth plan. Draw alſo
                    perpendicular lines from the points where the upper and lower tranſoms touch the
                    ſtern-poſt ; from the points of interſection of the ſtern timber with the two
                    horizontal linesdrawn between, and from the interſection of the ſtern timber
                    with the horizontal line drawn between the upper counter and top-timber line.
                    Then curves muſt be formed in the half-breadth plan for the ſhape of the body at
                    each of theſe heights. In order to which, begin with the horizontal or level
                    line repreſenting the height of the wing tranſom in the body plan. Lay a slip of
                    paper to that line, and mark on it the middle line and the timbers 37, 35, 33,
                    and 29; transfer the slip to the half-breadth plan, placing the point marked on
                    it for the middle line exactly on the middle in the half-breadth plan, and ſet
                    off the half-breadths on the correſponding timbers 37, 35, 33, and 29, and
                    deſcribe a curve through theſe points, and to interſect the perpendicular drawn
                    from the ſheer plan. In like manner proceed with the horizontal lines at the
                    heights of the counters, between the lower counter and wing tranſom,</p>
                <p>above the upper counter and top-timber line 5 and from the interſections of the
                    curve drawn in the half-breadth plan, with the perpendicular lines drawn from
                    the ſheer plan, take the diſtances to the middle line, and ſet them off on the
                    correſponding lines in the body plan ; ‘then a curve described through the
                    ſeveral points thus ſet off will be the repreſentative of the ſtern timber.</p>
                <p>The round-up of the wing tranſom, upper and lower counter, may be taken from the
                    ſheer draught, and ſet off at the middle line above their reſpective level lines
                    in the body plan, by which the round-up of each may be drawn. The round aft of
                    the wing tranſom may alſo be taken from the ſheer plan, and ſet off at the
                    middle line, abaft the perpendicular for the wing tranſom in the half-breadth
                    plan, whence the round aft of the wing tranſom may be deſcribed.</p>
                <p>The after body being now finiſhed, it remains to form the fore body ; but as the
                    operation is nearly the ſame in both, a repetition is therefore unneceſſary,
                    except in thoſe parts which require a different proceſs.</p>
                <p>The ſoremoſt timbers end on the item, and conſequently the method of deſcribing
                    the ending of them differs from that uſed for the timbers uſed in the after
                    body. Draw a line in the body plan parallel to the middle line, at a diſtance
                    equal to the half of what the ſtern is ſided. In the ſheer plan take the height
                    of the point of interſection of the lower part of the rabbet of the ſtern with
                    the timber which is required to be ended, and ſet it off on the line before
                    drawn in the body plan. Then take the extent between the points of interſection
                    of the timber with the lower and upper parts of the rabbet, and with one leg of
                    the compaſſes at the extremity of the diſtance laid off in the body plan
                    deſcribe a circle, and the timbers may then paſs over the back of this circle.
                    Now, by applying a ſmall ſquare to the timber, and letting the back of it
                    interſect the point ſet off for the lower part of the rabbet, the lower part of
                    the rabbet and the ending of the timbers will be deſcribed.</p>
                <p>The foremoſt timbers differ alſo very much at the head from thoſe in the after
                    body : For ſince the ſhip carries her breadth ſo far forward at the top-timber
                    line, it therefore occaſions the two foremoſt frames to fall out at the head
                    beyond the breadth, whence they are called <hi rend="italic">knuckle</hi>
                    timbers. They are thus deſcribed : The height of the top-timber line being ſet
                    off in the body plan, ſet off on it the top half breadth taken from the
                    half-breadth plan, and at that place draw a perpendicular ; then from the ſheer
                    plan take the height of the top of the side, and ſet ſt off on the perpendicular
                    in the body plan : Take alſo the breadth of the rail at the top-timber line in
                    the ſheer plan, and ſet it off below the top-timber line at the perpendicular
                    line in the body plan, and the ſtraight part of the knuckle timber to be drawn
                    will be determined. Then from the laſt mentioned point ſet off deſcribe a curve
                    through the points ſet off for the timber down to the upper breadth, and the
                    whole knuckle timber will be formed. It will hence be ſeen that thoſe timbers
                    forward will fall out beyond the main breadth with a hollow, contrary to the
                    reft of the top side, which falls within the main breadth with a hollow.</p>
                <p>The fore and after bodies being now formed, the water lines muſt next be
                    deſcribed in the half-breadth plan, in order to prove the fairneſs of the
                    bodies. In this draught the water lines are all repreſented parallel to<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0405.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0399"/> the keel ;
                    their heights may, therefore, be taken from the ſheer plan, and transferred to
                    the body plan, drawing horizontal lines, and the water lines will be repreſented
                    in the body plan. In ſhips that draw more water abaft than afore, the water
                    lines will not be parallel to the keel ; in this cafe, the heights muſt be taken
                    at every timber in the ſheer plan, and ſet off on their correſponding timbers in
                    the body plan ; and curves being deſcribed through the ſeveral points, will
                    repreſent the water lines in the body plan.</p>
                <p>Take the diſtances from the middle line to the points where the water lines
                    interſect the different timbers in the body plan, and ſet them off on their
                    correſponding timbers in the half-breadth plan. From the points where the water
                    lines in the ſheer plan interſects the aft part of the rabbet of the ſternpoſt
                    draw perpendiculars to the middle line of the half breadth plan, and upon theſe
                    perpendiculars ſet off from the middle line the half thickneſs of the ſternpoſt
                    at its correſponding water line ; which may be taken from the body plan, by
                    ſetting off the ſize of the post at the head and the keel, and drawing a line
                    for the tapering of it ; and where the line ſo drawn interſects the water lines,
                    that will be the half thickneſs required : then take an extent in the compaſſes
                    equal to the thickneſs of the plank, and fix one point where the half thickneſs
                    of the poſt interſects the perpendicular, and with the other deſcribe a circle,
                    from the back of which the water lines may paſs through their reſpective points
                    ſet off, and end at the fore part of the half breadth plan, proceeding in the
                    same manner as with the after part. A line drawn from the water line to the
                    point ſet off for the half thickneſs of the poſt will repreſent the aft part of
                    the rabbet of the poſt; and in like manner the rabbet of the ſtem may be
                    repreſented. The water lines being all deſcribed, it will be ſeen if the body is
                    fair; and if the timbers require any alteration, it ſhould be complied with.</p>
                <p>The Cant timbers of the after body may next be deſcribed in the half-breadth plan
                    ; in order to which the cant of the faſhion-piece muſt firſt be repreſented.
                    Having therefore the round aft of the wing tranſom repreſented in the
                    half-breadth plan, and alſo the ſhape of a level line at the height of the wing
                    tranſom ; then ſet off the breadth of the wing tranſom at the end, which is one
                    foot four inches, and that will be the place where the head of the faſhion-piece
                    will come : now to determine the cant of it, the ſhape of the body muſt be
                    conſidered ; as it muſt be canted in ſuch a manner as to preſerve as great a
                    ſtraightneſs as is poſſible for the ſhape of the timber, by which means the
                    timber will be much ſtronger than if it were crooked ; the cant muſt alſo be
                    conſidered, in order to let the timber have as little bevelling as poſſible.
                    Let, therefore, the heel of the timber be ſet off on the middle line, two feet
                    afore timber 35 ; and then drawing a line from thence to the point ſet off on
                    the level line for the wing tranſom, the cant of the faſhion piece will be
                    deſcribed, and will be found ſituated in the belt manner poſſible to anſwer the
                    before mentioned purpoſes.</p>
                <p>The cant of the faſhion-piece being repreſented, the cant of the other timbers
                    may now be eaſily determined. Let timber 29 be the foremoſt cant timber in the
                    after body, and with a pencil draw timber 28 ; then obſerve how many frames
                    there are between timber 28</p>
                <p>and the faſhion-piece, which will be found to be nine, namely, 29, 30, 31, 32,
                    33, 34, 35, 36, and 37. Now divide the diſtance between timber 28 and the
                    faſhion-piece on the middle line into 10 equal parts ; Divide alſo the
                    correſponding portion of the main half breadth lines into the same number of
                    equal parts ; and ſtraight lines joining the correſponding points at the middle
                    line with thoſe in the half-breadth line will repreſent the cant timbers in the
                    after body.</p>
                <p>The line drawn for the cant of the faſhion-piece repreſents the aft side of it,
                    which comes to the end of the tranſoms ; but in order to help the converſion
                    with regard to the lower tranſoms, there may be two more faſhion-pieces abaft
                    the former ; therefore the foremoſt faſhion-piece, or that which is already
                    deſcribed in the half-breadth plan, may only take the ends of the three upper
                    tranſoms, which are, the wing, filling, and deck ; the middle faſhion-piece may
                    take the four next, and the after faſhion piece the lower ones: therefore ſet
                    off in the half-breadth plan the ſiding of the middle and after faſhion-piece,
                    which may be 13 inches each ; then by drawing lines parallel to the foremoſt
                    faſhion-piece, at the aforeſaid diſtance from each other, the middle and after
                    faſhion-piece will be repreſented in the half-breadth plan.</p>
                <p>The faſhion-piece and tranſoms yet remain to be repreſented in the ſheer plan ;
                    in order to which, let the number of tranſoms be determined, which, for ſo large
                    a buttock, may be ſeven below the deck tranſom : draw them with a pencil,
                    beginning with the wing, the upper side of which is repreſented by a level line
                    at its height ; ſet off its ſiding below that, and draw a level line for the
                    lower edge. The filling tranſom follows ; which is merely for the purpoſe of
                    filling the vacancy between the under edge of the wing and the upper part of the
                    deck plank : it may therefore be repreſented by drawing two level lines for the
                    upper and lower edge, leaving about two inches between the upper edge and lower
                    edge of the wing tranſom, and four inches between the lower edge of the gun-deck
                    plank ; then the deck tranſom muſt be governed by the gun-deck, letting the
                    under side of the gun-deck plank repreſent the upper side of it, and ſetting off
                    its ſiding below that ; the under edge may alſo be drawn : the tranſoms below
                    the deck may all be ſided equally, which may be 11 inches ; they muſt alſo have
                    a ſufficient diſtance between to admit the circulation of the air to preſerve
                    them, which may be about three inches.</p>
                <p>The tranſoms being now drawn with a pencil, the faſhion-piece muſt next be
                    deſcribed in the ſheer plan, by which the length of the tranſoms as they appear
                    in that plan will be determined. As the foremoſt faſhion- piece reaches above
                    the upper tranſom, it may therefore be firſt deſcribed : in order to which, draw
                    a ſufficient number of level lines in the ſheer plan ; or, as the water lines
                    are level, draw therefore one line between the upper water line and the wing
                    tranſom, and one above the wing tranſom at the intended height of the head of
                    the faſhion-piece, which may be about five feet : then take the height of theſe
                    two level lines, and tranſfer them to the body plan ; and take off two or three
                    timbers and run them in the half-breadth plan, in the same manner as the water
                    lines were done ; then from the point where the line drawn for the cant of the
                    faſhion-piece, in the half-breadth plan, interſects the le<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0406.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0400"/>vel line drawn
                    for the head of the faſhion-piece, draw up a perpendicular to the ſaid line in
                    the ſheer plan, making a point. Again, from the interſection of the cant line,
                    with the level line for the wing tranſom in the half breadth plan, draw a
                    perpendicular to the wing tranſom in the sheer-plan. Alſo draw perpendiculars
                    from the points where the cant line in the half-breadth plan interſects the
                    level line below the wing tranſom, and alſo the water lines to the correſponding
                    lines in the ſheer plan ; then a curve deſcribed through theſe points will be
                    the repreſentation of the foremoſt faſhion-piece in the ſheer plan. In the ſame
                    manner the middle and after ſaſhion-pieces may be deſcribed ; observing to let
                    the middle one run up no higher than the under part of the deck tranſom, and the
                    after to the under side of the fourth tranſom under the deck. The tranſoms may
                    now be drawn with ink, as their lengths are limited by the faſhion-pieces.</p>
                <p>Neither the head nor the foreſide of the ſternpoſt are yet deſcribed ; take,
                    therefore, from the dimenſions, the breadth of the poſt on the keel, and ſet it
                    off on the upper edge of the keel from the aft ſide of poſt. The head of the
                    poſt muſt next be determined, which muſt juſt be high enough to admit of the
                    helm-poſt tranſom and the tiller coming between it and the upper deck beam ; the
                    height therefore that is neceſſary will be one foot nine inches above the wing
                    tranſom. Now draw a level line at that height, upon which ſet off the breadth of
                    the ſternpoſt at that place, taken from the dimenſions, and a line drawn from
                    thence to the point ſet off on the keel will be the foreſide of the ſternpoſt ;
                    obſerving, however, not to draw the line through the tranſoms, as it will only
                    appear between them. The inner poſt may be drawn, by ſetting off its thickneſs
                    forward from the ſternpoſt, and drawing a ſtraight line as before, continuing it
                    no higher than the under ſide of the wing tranſom.</p>
                <p>The cant-timbers in the aſter body being deſcribed, together with the parts
                    dependent on them, thoſe in the fore body may be next formed ; in order to
                    which, the foremoſt and aftermoſt cant timbers muſt be firſt determined, and
                    alſo the cant of the foremoſt ones. The foremoſt cant-timber will extend ſo far
                    forward as to be named amp;; the cant on the middle line may be one foot four
                    inches afore ſquare timber W, and on the main half breath line one foot nine
                    inches afore timber Y ; in which ſituation the line may be drawn for the cant ;
                    the aftermoſt may be timber The cant timbers may now be deſcribed in the ſame
                    manner as thoſe in the after body, namely, by ſpacing them equally between the
                    cant timber amp; and the ſquare timber P, both on the main half breadth and
                    middle lines, and drawing ſtraight lines between the correſponding points,
                    obſerving to let them run out to the top-timber half-breadth line, where it
                    comes without the main half breadth line.</p>
                <p>The hawſe pieces muſt next be laid down in the half breadth plan ; the ſides of
                    which muſt look fore and aft with the ſhip upon account of the round of the bow.
                    Take the ſiding of the apron, which may be about four inches more than the ſtem,
                    and ſet off half of it from the middle line, drawing a line from the main half
                    breadth to the foremoſt cant timber, which will repreſent the foremoſt edge of
                    the knight-head; then from that ſet off the ſiding of the knight-head, which may
                    be one foot four inches, and draw the aft side of it, The hawſe pieces may then
                    be drawn, which are foul in number, by ſetting off their ſidings, namely, one
                    foot six inches parallel from the knight-head and from each other ; and ſtraight
                    lines being drawn from the main half-breadth line to the foremoſt cant timber
                    will represont them.</p>
                <p>The hawſe holes ſhould be deſcribed in ſuch a manner as to wound the hawſe pieces
                    as little as poſſible ; they may therefore be placed ſo that the joint of the
                    hawſe pieces ſhall be in the centre of the holes, whence they will only cut half
                    the hawſe pieces. Take the dimenſions of the hawſe holes, which is one foot six
                    inches, and ſet off the foremoſt one, or that next the middle line, on the joint
                    between the firſt and ſecond hawſe piece ; then ſet off the other on the joint
                    between the third and fourth hawſe piece ; and ſmall lines being drawn acroſs
                    the main half breadth at their reſpective places will repreſent the hawſe holes
                    in the half-breadth plan.</p>
                <p>The hawſe holes ſhould next be repreſented in the ſheer plan. In this claſs of
                    ſhips they are always placed in the middle between the cheeks ; therefore ſet
                    off their diameter, namely, one foot six inches, between the cheeks, and draw
                    lines parallel to the cheeks for their upper and lower part. Then to determine
                    their ſituation agreeable to the half-breadth plan, which is the fore and aft
                    way, draw perpendiculars from their interſections with the main half-breadth
                    line to the lines drawn between the cheeks, and their true fixations, the fore
                    and aft way, will be obtained ; and, by deſcribmg them round or circular,
                    according to the points ſet off, they will be repreſented as they appear in the
                    ſheer plan.</p>
                <p>The apron may he drawn in the ſheer plan, ſetting off its bigneſs from the ſtem,
                    and letting it come ſo low that the ſcarf may be about two feet higher than the
                    foremoſt end of the fore foot ; by which it will give ſhip to the ſcarfs of the
                    ſtem. It may run up to the head of the ſtem.</p>
                <p>The cutting down ſhould next be drawn. Take therefore from the tables of
                    dimenſions the different heights there expreſſed, and ſet them off from the
                    upper edge of the keel on the correſponding timbers in the ſheer plan : then a
                    curve deſcribed through the points ſet off, from the inner poſt aft to the apron
                    forward, will be the cutting down. Next ſet off from the cutting down the
                    thickneſs of the timber ſtrake, which is 8 ½ inches, and a curve deſcribed
                    parallel to the former will repreſent the timber ſtrake, from which the depth of
                    the hold is always meaſured.</p>
                <p>The kelson is drawn, by taking its depth from the dimenſions, and ſetting it off
                    above the cutting down line; and a curve deſcribed parallel to the cutting down
                    will repreſent the kelson.</p>
                <p>The cutting down line being deſcribed, the knee of the dead wood abaft timber 27,
                    being the after floor timber, may then be repreſented. Set off the ſiding of the
                    floor abaft it, and erect a perpendicular in the ſheer plan, which will
                    terminate the foremoſt end of the dead wood : then the fore and aft arm of the
                    knee may be half the length of the whole dead wood, and the up and down arm may
                    reach to the under part of the lower transom ; and the whole knee may be placed
                    in such a manner that the upper piece of the dead<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0407.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0401"/> wood ſhall
                    belt over it, and be of as much ſubſtance as the knee itſelf : therefore the
                    knee muſt conſequently be placed its whole thickneſs below the cutting down line
                    repreſenting the upper part of the dead wood.</p>
                <p>The ſheer draught, the body, and half-breadth plans are now finiſhed, from whence
                    the ſhip may be laid down in the mould loft, and alſo the whole frame erected.
                    As, however, the uſe of the diagonal lines in the body plan has not been
                    ſufficiently explained, it is therefore thought proper to ſubjoin the following
                    illuſtration of them.</p>
                <p>The diagonal lines in the body plan are mentioned in the tables of dimenſions
                    merely for the purpoſe of forming the body therefrom; but after the body is
                    formed, they are of very principal uſe, as at their ſtations the ribbands and
                    harpins which keep the body of the ſhip together while in her frames are all
                    deſcribed, and the heads of the different timbers in the frame likewiſe
                    determined.</p>
                <p>The lowermoſt diagonal, or n⁰ 1. which is named the lower firmark, at which place
                    the bevellings are taken for the hollow of the floors ; its ſituation is
                    generally in the middle between the keel and the floor firmark.</p>
                <p>Second diagonal is placed in the midſhips, about 18 inches below the floor head,
                    and is the ſtation where the floor ribband is placed in midſhips, and likewiſe
                    the floor harpin forward ; there is alſo a bevelling taken at this diagonal all
                    the way fore and aft, from which it is termed the floor sirmark.</p>
                <p>Third diagonal, terminates the length of the floors, and is therefore called the
                    floor head. There are likewiſe bevellings taken at this diagonal as far forward
                    and aft as the floor extends. The placing of this diagonal is of the utmoſt
                    conſequence to the ſtrength of the ſhip, it being ſo near to that part of the
                    bulge which takes the ground, and of consequence is always liable to the
                    greateſt ſtrain ; it ſhould therefore be placed as much above the bearing of the
                    body in midſhips as could be conveniently allowed by conversion of the timber ;
                    but afore and abaft it is not of ſo much conſequence.</p>
                <p>Fourth diagonal is placed in the middle between the floor head and the fifth
                    diagonal, at which place a ribband and harpin are ſtationed for the ſecurity of
                    the firſt or lower futtock, from whence it is named the first futtock sirmark.
                    There are alſo bevellings taken at this diagonal all afore and aft, which being
                    part of the body where the timbers moſt vary, occasions them to be the greateſt
                    bevellings in the whole body.</p>
                <p>Fifth diagonal terminates the heads of the firſt futtocks, and is therefore
                    called the first futtock head. It ſhould be placed at a convenient diſtance
                    above the floor head, in order to give a ſufficient ſcarf to the lower part of
                    the ſecond futtocks. There are likewiſe bevellings for the timbers taken at this
                    diagonal, all fore and aft.</p>
                <p>Sixth diagonal ſhould be placed in the middle between the firſt futtock head and
                    the ſeventh diagonal ; at which place the ribband and harpin are ſtationed for
                    the support of the ſecond futtocks. Bevellings are taken at this diagonal all
                    fore and aft. It is named the second futtock sirmark.</p>
                <p>Seventh diagonal terminates the ſecond futtock beads from the fore to the
                    aftermoſt floors, and afore and abaft them it terminates the double futtock
                    heads</p>
                <p>in the fore and aft cant bodies. It ſhould be placed in midſhips, as much above
                    the firſt futtock head as the firſt futtock is above the floor head : by which
                    it gives the same ſcarf to the lower part of the third futtock as the firſt
                    futtock does to the ſecond. There are bevellings taken all fore and aft at this
                    diagonal. It is named the ſecond futtock head.</p>
                <p>Eighth diagonal is the ſtation for the ribband and harpin which ſupports the
                    third futtocks, and is therefore placed between the ſecond futtock head and
                    ninth diagonal. It is alſo a bevelling place, and is named the third futtock
                    sirmark.</p>
                <p>Ninth and laſt diagonal is placed the ſame diſtance above the lecond futtock head
                    as that is above the firſt, and terminates all the heads of the third futtocks
                    which are in the frames, as they come between the ports ; but ſuch as are
                    between the frames, and come under the lower deck ports, muſt run up to the
                    under part of the ports, as no ſhort timbers ſhould by any means be admitted
                    under the ports, which require the greateſt poſſible ſtrength. This diagonal is
                    likewiſe a bevelling place for the heads of the third futtocks, and is therefore
                    called the third futtock head.</p>
                <p>The fourth futtock heads are terminated by the under part of the upper deck ports
                    all fore and aft, and a ribband is placed fore and aft at the height of the
                    upper breadth line, another between the lower and upper deck ports, and one at
                    the top-timber line ; which, with the ribbands and harpins before-mentioned,
                    keep the whole body of the ſhip together, and likewiſe in its proper form and
                    ſhape.</p>
                <p>It muſt be obſerved, that the diagonal lines laid down in the dimenſions will not
                    correſpond to what has been laid above upon diagonals, as they were drawn
                    diſcretionally upon the body for the purpoſe of giving the true dimenſions of
                    it. Therefore, when the body is drawn in fair, the firſt diagonals (which ſhould
                    only be in pencil) are to be rubbed out, and the proper diagonals drawn with red
                    ink, ſtrictly adhering to what has been ſaid above.</p>
                <p>Sect. III. Of the Inboard Works of the Ship deſcribed in the preceding
                    Sectiοn.</p>
                <p>Draughts of the outboard works being now conſtructed, in which every part is
                    deſcribed that is necesſary to enable the artiſt to put the ship in her frames,
                    we muſt now proceed to form another draught of the cavity of the ſhip or inboard
                    works, which muſt be ſo contrived that every thing within the ſhip may be
                    arranged in the moſt commodious manner and to the beſt advantage.</p>
                <p>It is uſual to draw the inboard works in the ſheer-draught ; but as this
                    generally occasions much confusion, it is therefore the beſt and easieſt method
                    to appropriate a draught to this particular purpoſe<note anchored="false" n="9" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Ship-Builder's

                <p>Take from the ſheer draught the ſtem, ſtern-poſt, counter timbers, and keel, and
                    deſcribe them on another paper ; draw in alſo the cutting down, kelſon, apron,
                    tranſoms, faſhion-pieces, and decks, and the upper line of the ſheer all fore

                <p>The beams come firſt under conſideration, and ſhould be ſo diſposed as to come
                    one under and one between each port, or as near as can be to anſwer other works
                    of the ship ; but where it happens that a beam cannot poſſibly be placed under
                    the port, then a beam arm<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0408.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0402"/> ſhould be introduced to make good the
                    deficiency. Every beam, and alſo the beam arms, ſhould be kneed ’at each end
                    with one lodging and one hanging knee ; and in thoſe parts of the ſhip which
                    require the knees to be very acute, ſuch as the after beams of the gun- deck,
                    and in ſome ſhips, whoſe bodies are very ſharp, the foremoſt beams of the
                    gun-deck, there ſhould be knees of iron. Care ſhould be taken always to let the
                    upper side of the knees be below the ſurface of the beams in large ſhips one
                    inch and a half, and in ſmall ſhips an inch, by which means the air will have a
                    free paſſage between the knees and under part of the deck.</p>
                <p>In the conversion of the beams the ſide next the lodging knee ſhould be left as
                    broad at the end of the beam as can poſſibly be allowed by the timber, the beam
                    retaining its proper ſcantling at the end <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the lodging
                    knee : by ſo doing the lodging knees will be more without a ſquare, which
                    conſequently makes them the more eaſy to be provided.</p>
                <p>In ſhips where the beams can be got in one piece, they ſhould be ſo dispoſed as
                    to have every other one with the butt end the ſame way ; for this reaſon, that
                    the butts will decay before the tops. In large ſhips the beams are made in two
                    or three pieces, and are therefore allowed to be ſtronger than thoſe that are in
                    one piece. The beams in two pieces may have the ſcarf one-third of the length,
                    and thoſe in three pieces ſhould have the middle piece half the length of the
                    whole beam. The cuſtomary way of putting them together is to table them; and the
                    length of the tablings ſhould be one-half more than the depth of the beam. It is
                    very common to divide the tablings in the middle of the beam, and that part
                    which is taken out at the upper ſide to be left at the lower ſide, and then
                    kerſey or flannel is put into the ſcarf : but in this caſe the water is liable
                    to lie in the ſcarf, and muſt be the means of rotting the beams. If, however,
                    the beams were tabled together in dovetails, and taken through from ſide to
                    ſide, putting tar only between them, which hardens the wood ; then the water
                    occaſioned by the leaking of the decks would have a free passage, and the beam
                    would dry again ; and this method would not be found inferior in point of
                    ſtrength to the other. The length of the fore and aft arm of the lodging knee
                    ſhould extend to the ſide of the hanging knee next to it ; but there is no
                    neceſſity for that arm to be longer than the other. In faſtening the knees, care
                    ſhould be taken to let one bolt paſs exactly through the middle of the throat,
                    one foot six inches from each end, and the reft divided equally between ;
                    obſerving always to have the holes bored ſquare from the knee. The bolts for the
                    thwartſhip arms of both hanging and lodging knees may go through the arms of
                    each knee, and drive every one the other way.</p>
                <p>In order to draw the beams in the draught, take the moulding of the lower deck
                    beams, and ſet it off below the line repreſenting the deck at the ſide, and draw
                    a line in pencil parallel thereto, which will repreſent the under ſide of the
                    beams. In like manner repreſent the under side of the beams for the upper deck,
                    quarter deck, forecaſtle, and roundhouſe. Then take the ſiding of the lower deck
                    beams, and place one under and one between each port, all fore and aft, drawing
                    them in pencil. Determine the dimenſions of the well fore</p>
                <p>and aft, which is ten feet, and let it off abaft the beam under the eighth port,
                    placing the beam under the ninth port at that diſtance : thoſe two beams may
                    then be drawn in ink, and will terminate the extent of the well the fore and aft
                    way ; and as a beam cannot go acroſs the ſhip at that place upon account of its
                    being the well and maſt room, there muſt therefore be a beam arm between theſe
                    two beams.</p>
                <p>The main hatchway ſhould then be determined, letting the beam that forms the fore
                    part of the well form the aft part of it, and the beam under the next part may
                    form the fore ſide of it, which beam may alſo be now drawn in ink : there ſhould
                    alſo be another beam arm introduced in the wake of the main hatchway.</p>
                <p>The fore hatchway may be next determined ; the fore ſide of which ſhould range
                    well up and down with the after end of the forecaſtle, and it may be fore and
                    aft about four-ſevenths of the main hatchway. At the foreſide of the fore
                    hatchway there muſt be a ladderway down to the orlop, which may be as much fore
                    and aft as the beams will allow. The rest of the beams afore the fore hatchway
                    may remain as ſirſt placed, there being nothing in the way to alter the ſhip.
                    Then determine on the after hatchway, the foreſide of which comes to the aft
                    ſide of the main maſt room.</p>
                <p>There ſhould alſo be a hatchway, the foreſide of which may be formed by the aft
                    ſide of the beam under the twelfth port ; which is for the convenieney of the
                    ſpirit and fiſh rooms : and there ſhould be a ladderway abaft it to lead down to
                    the cockpit. There may be alſo another hatchway, the foreſide of it to be formed
                    by the aft ſide of the beam under the eleventh port. The ſize of the ladder and
                    hatchways muſt be governed by the-beams, as when there is a good shift of beams
                    they ſhould not be altered for ladder and hatchways, unleſs it is the three
                    principal hatchways, which muſt always be of a proper ſize, according to the
                    ſize of the ſhip.</p>
                <p>The after capſtan muſt be placed between the two hatchways laſt deſcribed, and
                    the beams abaft may ſtand as they are already ſhifted, obſerving only the
                    mizenmaſt. There ſhould be a ſmall ſcuttle placed afore the ſecond beam ſrom
                    aft, for the convenience of the bread room : it muſt be on one of the middle
                    lines, as there is a calling at the middle under the four or five after beams to
                    receive the pillars for the ſupport thereof.</p>
                <p>The bits may be placed, letting the foreſide of the after ones come againſt the
                    aft ſide of the beam abaft the third port, and the foreſide of the foremoſt ones
                    againſt the next beam but one forward ; then at the foreſide of each bit there
                    ſhould be drawn a ſmall ſcuttle for the conveniency of handing up the powder
                    from the magazine. The breaſt hook ſhould alſo be drawn, which may be three feet
                    the moulding away, and ſided nine-tenths of the beams of the lower deck.</p>
                <p>The gun-deck, beams, knees, amp;c <hi rend="italic">.</hi> being deſcribed ; in
                    which, as well as all the decks having ports, the ſame precautions are to be
                    uſed as in the gun-deck ; and obſerving to keep the beams upon one deck as
                    nearly as poſſible over the beams of the other, for the conveniency of
                    pillaring, as they will then ſupport each other.</p>
                <p>The hatchways are to be placed exactly over those<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0409.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0403"/> on the lower
                    deck, each over each ; and therefore, where there is a beam arm in the lower
                    deck there muſt alſo be one above it in the upper deck, and the ſame in the
                    middle deck in three-deck ſhips. It commonly happens in ſhips of the line that
                    there cannot be a whole beam between the deck breaſt hook and the beam that
                    ſupports the ſtep of the bowſprit, becauſe the bowſprit paffes through that
                    place : in this cafe, there muſt be a beam arm placed, letting the end come
                    equally between the beam and the breaſt hook : but in ſhips that the bowſprit
                    will allow of a whole beam, then the ports and the reſt of the beams muſt be
                    conſulted in order to ſpace it ; and when it ſo happens that the fore- maſt
                    comes in the wake of a port, then a beam arm muſt be necessarily introduced.</p>
                <p>Having placed the beams according to the diſpoſition of the other beams below,
                    the ladder-ways ſhould be contrived : there ſhould be one next abaft the fore
                    hatchway, which is a single ladder-way ; and one next afore the main hatch,
                    which is a double ladder-way ; the ladders ſtanding the fore and aft way. There
                    ſhould alſo be another next abaft the after hatch, and one over the cockpit
                    correſponding with that on the lower deck.</p>
                <p>The capſtans are next to be conſidered ; the after one is already placed on the
                    lower deck, the barrel of which muſt paſs through the upper deck to receive the
                    whelps and drumhead there, it being a double capſtan. In ſhips having three
                    decks, the upper part of each capſtan is in the middle deck ; but in ſhips with
                    one deck there is only this one capſtan, the upper part of which is placed on
                    the quarter deck. The foremoſt capſtan ſhould be placed in the moſt convenient
                    ſpot, to admit of its being lowered down to the orlop out of the way of the long
                    boat : it may therefore be placed between the main and fore hatchways ; the beam
                    under the ſixth port of the lower deck may form the aft ſide of its room, and
                    the beams on each ſide of it ſhould be placed exactly over or under the beams on
                    the other decks, and they ſhould be at a diſtance from each other ſufficient to
                    let the drumheads paſs between them. The centre of the capſtan ſhould then be
                    placed in the middle between the beams which compoſe its room ; and the partners
                    ſhould be fitted in ſuch a manner as to ſhift occaſionally when wanted, which is
                    by letting them be in two pieces fitted together. The partners on the lower
                    deck, wherein the capſtan ſteps, muſt be ſupported by a pillar on the orlop
                    deck, the lower part of which may be fitted in an oak chock ; ſo that when the
                    pillar is taken away, and the capſtan lowered down, that chock ſerves as a ſtep
                    for the capſtan. Thoſe two beams on the orlop, by having the pillar and chock
                    upon them, have therefore the whole weight of the capſtan preſſing downwards :
                    for the ſupport of them, there ſhould be a carling placed underneath the fore
                    and aft way, with three pillars, one under each beam, and one between ; all of
                    them being ſtept in the kelſon, by which the orlop deck will be well ſupported
                    in the wake of the capſtan, and the other decks will feel no ſtrain from it.</p>
                <p>The fire hearth is next to be diſpoſed ; which is placed differently according to
                    the ſize of the ſhip. In three-deckers it is found moſt convenient to place it
                    on the middle deck ; whence there is much more room under the forecaſtle than
                    there would have been had it</p>
                <p>been placed there. In all two-deck ſhips it is placed under the forecaſtle,
                    becauſe on the deck underneath the bits are in the way. It is alſo under the
                    forecaſtle in one-deck ſhips, though confined between the bits : in this caſe it
                    ſhould be kept as near as poſſible to the after bits, that there may be more
                    room between it and the foremoſt bits to make a good galley.</p>
                <p>The poſitions of the main-topſail-ſheet bits are next to be determined ; the
                    foremoſt of which muſt be ſo placed as to let its foreside come againſt the aft
                    side of the beam abaft the main hatchway, and to paſs down to the lower deck,
                    and there ſtep in the beams : admitting it to be a ſtraight piece, it would come
                    at the aft ſide of the lower deck beam the ſame as it does at the upper deck
                    beam, in conſequence of thoſe two beams ranging well up and down with each other
                    : it muſt therefore have a caſt under the upper deck beam, by which the lower
                    part may be brought forward ſufficient to ſtop in the lower deck beam. The
                    aftermoſt muſt be placed againſt the foreſide of the beam abaft the mast, and
                    ſtep on the beam below ; but there is no neceſſity to provide a crooked piece as
                    before, for the beam of the upper deck may be moved a little farther aft, till
                    it admit of the bit ſtopping on the lower deck beam, unleſs the beam comes under
                    a port, as in that caſe it muſt not by any means be moved. The croſs pieces to
                    the bits ſhould be on the foreſide, and in height from the upper deck about
                    one-third of the height between it and the quarter deck. With regard to the
                    heads of the bits, the length of the ſhip’s waſte ſhould be conſidered ; and if
                    there is length enough from the forecaſtle to the foremoſt bits to admit of the
                    ſpare geer being ſtowed thereon without reaching farther aft, the quarter deck
                    may then run ſo far forward that the head of the foremoſt bits ſhall tenon in
                    the foremoſt beam ; this gives the mainmaſt another deck, and admits of the
                    quarter deck being all that the longer : but if there is not the room before
                    mentioned, then the quarter deck muſt run no further forward than the after
                    bits, which will then tenon in the foremoſt beam ; and the foremoſt bits muſt
                    have a croſs piece let on their heads, which is termed a <hi rend="italic"
                        >horſe,</hi> and will be for the purpoſe of receiving the ends of the ſpare
                    geer.</p>
                <p>The length of the quarter deck being now determined, the beams are then to be
                    placed. For this purpoſe the ſeveral contrivances in the quarter deck muſt be
                    previouſly conſulted. It is necessary to obſerve, that there are neither
                    carlings nor lodges, the carlings of the hatches excepted, in the quarter deck,
                    round-houſe, and forecaſtle ; as they would weaken inſtead of ſtrengthening the
                    beams, which ſhould be as ſmall as the ſize of the ſhip will permit, in order
                    that the upper works may be as light as poſſible. Hence, as there are to be
                    neither carlings nor lodges, the deck will require a greater number of beams,
                    and a good round up, as on the contrary the deck would be apt to bend with its
                    own weight. The moſt approved rule is therefore to have double the number of
                    beams in the quarter deck as there are in a ſpace of the ſame length in the
                    upper deck.</p>
                <p>Then proceed to ſhift the beams to the beſt advantage, conſulting the hatchways,
                    ladder-ways, mails, bits, wheel, &amp;c. With reſpect to the ladder-ways on the
                    quarter decks of all ſhips, there ſhould be one near the fore part of the great
                    cabin for the officers, and an-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0410.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0404"/> other near the foremoſt end of the quarter deck,
                    consiſting of double ladders for the conveyance of the men up from the other
                    decks in cafes of emergency ; and ſikewiſe one on each fide of the fore part of
                    the quarter deck from the gangway : and in every ſhip of the line all the beams
                    from the foremoſt ladder-way to the after one ſhould be open with gratings, both
                    for the admission of air, and for the greater expedition of conveying different
                    articles in the time of action.</p>
                <p>Two ſcuttles are to be diſpoſed one on each side of the mainmaſt, if it happens
                    to come through the quarter deck, tor the top tackles to paſs through, to hook
                    to the eye bolts drove in the upper deck for that purpoſe.</p>
                <p>The ſteering wheel ſhould be placed under the forepart of the ronndhouſe, and the
                    two beams of the quarter deck, which come under it, ſhould be placed conformable
                    to the two uprights, ſo that they may tenon in them. The quarter deck beams
                    ſhould be kneed at each end with one hanging and one lodging knee ; which adds
                    greatly to the ſtrength of the side. The hanging knees which come in the great
                    cabin may be of iron ; their vertical arms to be two-thirds of the length of
                    that of wood, and to reach the ſpirketing. It ſhould be obſerved, that the beam
                    abaft, which comes under the ſcreen bulkhead, ſhould round aft agreeable to the
                    round of the bulkhead, for the ſupport of the same.</p>
                <p>The forecaſtle beams ſhould be placed according as the works of the deck will
                    admit. The hatchways are therefore to be considered first. There ſhould be one
                    for the funnel of the fire hearth to paſs through, and one for the copper to
                    admit of vent for the ſteam ; and alſo one or two over the galley as the
                    forecaſtle will admit of. The fore-topſail-ſheet bits ſhould be ſo diſpoſed as
                    to come one pair on the fore and one on the aft side of the mast, to let into
                    the side of the forecaſtle beams, and ſtep on the upper deck beams below : there
                    ſhould alſo be a ladder-way at the fore part of the fore- caſtle for the
                    conveniency of the fore part of the ſhip.</p>
                <p>The beams may now be placed agreeable thereto, their number being four more than
                    there are in a ſpace in the upper deck equal in length to the forecaſtle ; and
                    where there happens to be a wide opening between the beams, as in the case of a
                    hatchway, mast room, &amp;c. then half a beam of fir may be introduced to make
                    good the deficiency. The foremoſt beam ſhould be of a breadth ſufficient to take
                    the aft side of the inboard arms of the catheads, as they are ſecured upon this
                    beam by being bolted thereto. Every beam of the forecaſtle ſhould be kneed at
                    each end with one hanging and one lodging knee : the vertical arms of the
                    hanging knees ſhould reach the ſpirketing, and the knees well bolted and
                    carefully clenched.</p>
                <p>Proceed to the roundhouſe ; the same things being obſerved with reſpect to the
                    beams as in the quarter deck : for as the roundhouſe beams are sided very ſmall,
                    it hence follows that they muſt be near co each other. Let therefore the number
                    of beams on the roundhouſe be four more than in the same length of the quarter
                    deck ; every other beam being of fir for lightneſs, and every oak beam may be
                    kneed at each end with one hanging and one lodging knee ; the hanging knees
                    abaft may be of iron, their vertical arms to be in length two thirds of thoſe of
                    wood. The roundhouſe ſhould always have a great round up, both for ſtrength and
                    conveniency. There muſt be on the roundhouſe a ſmall pair of knee-bits on each
                    fide of the mizenmaſt, turned round and scarfed over each other, and bolted
                    through the mast catlings. There muſt alſo be a companion on the roundhouſe
                    placed over the middle of the coach, in order to give light thereto.</p>
                <p>With regard to placing the roundhouſe beams, the uprights of the ſteering wheel
                    and the mizenmaſt are to be obſerved ; as when the beams which interfere with
                    thoſe parts are properly ſpaced, the rest may be diſpoſed of at diſcretion, or
                    at an equal diſtance from each other, and letting the beam over the ſcreen
                    bulkhead have a proper round aft, agreeable to the quarter deck beam
                    underneath.</p>
                <p>The upper parts of the inboard works being now deſcribed, proceed next to the
                    lower parts, or to thoſe which come below the lower deck. Draw in the orlop, by
                    taking the heights afore, at midſhips, and abaft, between that and the gun-deck,
                    from the dimenſions, and a curve deſcribed through theſe points will repreſent
                    the upper part of the deck. Set off the thickneſs of the plank below, and the
                    under ſide of the plank will be repreſented. As this deck does not run quite
                    forward and aft as the other decks, the length of it muſt be therefore
                    determined ; for this purpoſe let the after beam be placed at a ſufficient
                    diſtance from aft to admit of the bread rooms being of a proper ſize for the
                    ſhip, which will be under that beam of the gun deck that comes at the ſecond
                    part from aft. The after beam being drawn in, proceed to ſpace the other beams,
                    placing them exactly under thoſe of the gun-deck ; and that which comes under
                    the foremoſt beam of the gun- deck may terminate the fore part of the orlop.
                    Draw the limber ſtrake, by ſetting off its thickneſs above the cutting down
                    line, and a line drawn parallel thereto will repreſent the limber ſtrake. That
                    part of the orlop which is over the after magazine, ſpirit room, and fish room,
                    and alſo that which is over the fore magazine, is laid with thicker planks than
                    the reft oſ the deck ; which is for the better security of thoſe places, the
                    planks being laid over the beams ; but in the midſhips, from the fore part of
                    the ſpirit room to the aft part of the fore magazine, the beams are laid level
                    with the surface of the deck, and the planks are rabbeted in from one beam to
                    the other.</p>
                <p>In order to repreſent the orlop as juſt deſcribed, the dimenſions of the
                    different apartments above mentioned muſt be determined : Let the aft ſide of
                    the after beam be the aft ſide of the after magazine, and from thence draw the
                    bulkhead down to the limber ſtrake ; and the foreſide of the third beam may be
                    the foreſide of the after magazine, drawing that bulkhead likewise, which will
                    alſo form the aft ſide oſ the fiſh room ; the foreſide of the fiſh room may be
                    drawn from the aft ſide of the fifth beam, which will alſo repreſent the aft
                    side of the ſpirit room ; then the foreſide of the ſpirit room may be drawn from
                    the foreſide of the ſixth beam. Hence from the foreſide of the ſixth beam quite
                    aft the deck, will be repreſented by the two lines already drawn, and the upper
                    ſide of the beams will he repreſented by the lower line.</p>
                <p>Proceed next to the forepart of the orlop, letting the<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0411.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0405"/> foreſide oſ
                    the after bits be the aft part of the foremoſt magazine, drawing the bulkhead
                    thereof, which will come to the aft side of the sixth beam ; therefore, from the
                    sixth beam to the foremoſt end of the orlop, the plank and beams will be
                    repreſented juſt in the ſame manner as before mentioned for the after part of
                    the orlop : then the midſhip part of the deck will be repreſented by letting the
                    upper line be the upper side of the plank, and likewiſe the upper side of the
                    beams ; and the lower line will repreſent the lower edge of the plank, only
                    drawing it from beam to beam, and obſerving not to let it paſs through them.</p>
                <p>The hatchways, &amp;c. may now be repreſented on the orlop, letting the main,
                    fore, and after hatchway, be exactly under thoſe of the gun-deck : there muſt be
                    one over the fiſh room, and one over the spirit room. There muſt be two ſcuttles
                    over the after magazine for the passage to the magazine and light room. There
                    ſhould alſo be one afore the fourth beam from forward for the passage to the
                    fore magazine, and one abaft the ſecond beam for the paſſage to the light
                    room.</p>
                <p>The bulkheads for the fore and after parts of the well may be drawn from the
                    lower deck beams to the orlop, and from thence to the limber ſtrake in the hold.
                    The ſhot lockers may alſo be repreſented, having one afore and one abaft the
                    well : there ſhould alſo be one abaft the foremoſt magazine, the ends of which
                    may be formed by the after bits. The ſteps of the masts may be drawn in by
                    continuing their centres down to the limber ſtrake ; and likewiſe two crutches
                    abaft the mizen ſtep divided equally between that and the after part of the
                    cutting down : the breaſt hooks may alſo be drawn letting them be five in number
                    below the lower deck hook, and all equally divided between that and the fore
                    ſtep. Hence every part of the inboard is decribed as far as neceſtary.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Having</hi> now finiſhed the methods of laying down the
                    ſeveral plans of a ſhip, any farther addition on this ſubject might appear
                    unnecessary. We cannot, however, with propriety, omit to deſcribe the method
                    called <hi rend="italic">whole-moulding,</hi> uſed by the ancients, and which
                    still continues in uſe among thoſe unacquainted with the more proper methods
                    already explained. This method will be illuſtrated by laying down the ſeveral
                    plans of a longboat; the length of the keel being 29 feet, and breadth moulded
                    nine ſeet.</p>
                <p>Draw the ſtraight line PO (fig. 37.) equal to 29 feet, the extreme length oſ the
                    boat, and alſo to repreſent the upper edge of the keel. Let ⊕ be the ſtation of
                    the midſhip frame. From the points P, ⊕, and O, draw the lines PT, ⊕M, and OS,
                    perpendicular to PO. Make ⊕M, ⊕N, equal to the upper and lower heights of
                    breadth reſpectively at the main frame, PT the height of breadth at the tranſom,
                    and OS the height at the ſtem. Deſcribe the curve TMS to repreſent the ſheer or
                    extreme height of the side, which in a ſhip would be called the <hi

                    Through the point N draw a curve parallel to TMS, to repreſent the breadth of
                    the upper ſtrake of a boat, or lower edge of the wale if in a ſhip. The dotted
                    line TNS may alſo be drawn to repreſent the lower height of breadth.</p>
                <p>Set off the rake of the port from P to <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> and draw the
                    line <hi rend="italic">p t</hi> to repreſent the aft side of the port ; then T
                        <hi rend="italic">t</hi> will repreſent the round up of the tranſom. Set off
                    the breadth of the port from <hi rend="italic">p</hi> to r, and from T to s, and
                    draw the line <hi rend="italic">r</hi> s to repreſent the foreside of the port,
                    which may either be a curve or a ſtraight line at pleaſure. Set up the height of

                    to repreſent the foreside of the tranſom.</p>
                <p>There is given the point S, the height of the ſheer on the foreside of the ſtem ;
                    now that side of the ſtem is to be formed either by ſweeps or some other
                    contrivance. Set off the breadth of the ſtem, and form the aft side of it.</p>
                <p>Set up the dead-rising from ⊕ to d, and form the rising line r i s. Draw the line
                    KL parallel to PO to repreſent the lower edge of the keel, and another to
                    repreſent the thickneſs of the plank or the rabbet. The rabbet on the poſt and
                    ſtem may also be repreſented ; and the ſtations of the timbers aſſigned, as⊗, (
                    1 ), 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9 ; and ⊕, (A), A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H ; and the ſheer
                    plan will be completed.</p>
                <p>The half-breadth plan is to be formed next ; for this purpoſe the perpendiculars
                    TP, 9, 8, &amp;c. muſt be produced. Upon M⊕ produced ſet off the half breadth
                    from the line KL to R (fig. 38.) ; ſet off alſo the half breadth at the tranſom
                    from K to <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> and deſcribe the extreme half breadth line
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> RX, making the forepart of the curve agreeable to
                    the propoſed round of the tranſom.</p>
                <p>We may next proceed to form the timbers in the body plan. Let AB (fig. 39.) be
                    the breadth moulded at ⊕. Erect the perpendicular CD in the middle of the line
                    AB ; draw the line <hi rend="italic">m n</hi> diſtant therefrom the half
                    thickneſs of the poſt, and <hi rend="italic">x y</hi> the half thickneſs of the
                    ſtern. Then take off the ſeveral portions of the perpendiculars®, 1, 2, &amp;c.
                    intercepted between the upper edge of the keel and the rising line in the ſheer
                    plan, and ſet them up from C upon the line CD ; through theſe points draw lines
                    parallel to AC ; take off alſo the ſeveral lower heights of breadth at⊗ , 1, 2,
                    &amp;c. from the sheer plan ; and ſet them up from C upon the middle line in the
                    body plan; and draw lines parallel to AC through theſe points : Then take off
                    the ſeveral half breadths correſponding to each from the floor plan ; and ſet
                    them off on their proper half-breadth lines from the middle line in the body
                    plan.</p>
                <p>Conſtruct the midſhip frame by Problem V. the form of which will in ſome meaſure
                    determine the form of the rest. For if a mould be made on any side of the middle
                    line to fit the curve part of it, and the rising line, or that marked <hi
                        rend="italic">bend mould</hi> (fig. 40.), and laid in ſuch a manner that the
                    lower part it, which is ſtraight, may be ſet upon the ſeveral rising lines, and
                    the upper part juſt touch the point of the half breadth in the breadth line
                    correſponding to that rifing upon which the mould is placed, a curve may then be
                    drawn by the mould to the rising line. In this manner we may proceed ſo far as
                    the rising line is parallel to the lower height oſ the breadth line. Then a
                    hollow mould muſt be made, the upper end of which is left ſtraight, as<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0412.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0406"/> that marked
                        <hi rend="italic">hollow mould</hi> (fig. 40.). This is applied in ſuch a
                    manner, that ſome part of the hollow may touch the side of the keel, and the
                    ſtraight part touch the back of the curve before deſcribed by the bend mould ;
                    and, beginning abaft, the ſtraight part will always come lower on every timber,
                    till we come to the midship timber, when it comes to the side of the keel.
                    Having thus formed the timbers, ſo far as the whole mouldings will ſerve, the
                    timbers abaft them are next formed. Their half breadths are determined by the
                    ſheer and floor plans, which are the only fixed points through which the curves
                    of theſe timbers muſt pals. Some form theſe after timbers before the whole is
                    moulded, and then make the hollow mould, which will be ſtraighter than the
                    hollow of either of theſe timbers. It is indifferent which are firſt formed, or
                    what methods are uſed ; for after the timbers are all formed, though every
                    timber may appear very fair when conſidered by itſelf, it is uncertain what the
                    form of the side will be. In order to find which, we muſt form ſeveral ribband
                    and water lines ; and if theſe do not make fair curves, they muſt be rectified,
                    and the timbers formed from theſe ribband and water lines. In uſing the hollow
                    mould, when it is applied to the curve of each timber, if the ſtraight part is
                    produced to the middle line, we ſhall have as many points of interſection as
                    there are timbers ; and if the heights above the bale be transferred to the
                    correſponding timbers in the ſheer plan, a curve paſſing through theſe points is
                    what is called a ri <hi rend="italic">ſing strait.</hi> This may be formed by
                    fixing a point for the aftermoſt timber that is whole moulded, and transferring
                    that height to the ſheer plan. The curve muſt paſs through this point, and fall
                    in with the riſing line ſomewhere abaft dead flat ; and if the ſeveral heights
                    of this line be transferred from the ſheer to the middle line in the body plan,
                    theſe points will regulate what is called the <hi rend="italic">hauling
                        down</hi> of the hollow mould.</p>
                <p>The timbers in the after body being all formed, thoſe in the fore body are formed
                    in the ſame manner, by transferring the ſeveral heights of the rising and
                    breadth lines from the ſheer to the body plan ; the half breadths correſponding
                    to each height muſt alſo be transferred from the floor to the body plan. The
                    ſame hollow mould will ſerve both for the fore and after body ; and the level
                    lines, by which the water lines to prove the after body were formed, may be
                    produced into the fore body, and by them, the water lines to prove the fore
                    body, may be deſcribed.</p>
                <p>Another method of proving the body is by ribband lines, which are formed by
                    ſections of planes inclined to the ſheer plan, and interſecting the body plan
                    diagonally, as before obſerved, of which there may be as many as may be judged
                    neceſſary. As this has been already explained, we ſhall therefore lay down only
                    one, repreſented in the body plan by the lines marked d i a. Theſe are drawn in
                    ſuch a manner as to be perpendicular to as many timbers as conveniently may be.
                    After they are drawn in the body plan, the ſeveral portions of the diagonal
                    intercepted between the middle line and each timber muſt be transferrred to the
                    floor plan. Thus, fix one foot of the compaſſes in the point where the diagonal
                    intersects the middle line in the body plan ; extend the other foot to the point
                    where the diagonal interſects the timber ; for example, timber 9 : Set off the
                    same extent upon the perpendicular repreſenting the plane</p>
                <p>of timber 9 from the point where it intersects the line KL on the floor plan : in
                    like manner proceed with all the other timbers both in the fore and after body ;
                    and theſe ſhall have the points thro’ which the curve muſt paſs. If this ſhould
                    not prove a fair curve, it muſt be altered, obſerving to conform to the points
                    as nearly as the nature of the curve will admit : ſo it may be carried within
                    one point, and without another, according as we find the timbers will allow. For
                    after all the ribband lines are formed, the timbers muſt, if needful, be altered
                    by the ribband lines : this is only the reverſe of forming the ribband lines ;
                    for taking the portions of the ſeveral perpendiculars intercepted between the
                    line KL and the curve of the ribband line in the floor plan, and ſetting them
                    off upon the diagonal from the point where it interſects the middle line, we
                    ſhall have the points in the diagonal through which the curves of the timbers
                    muſt paſs. Thus the diſtance between the line KL and the ribband at timber 3 on
                    the floor plan, when transferred to the body plan, will extend on the diagonal
                    from the middle line to the point where the curve of timber 3 interſects that
                    diagonal. The like may be ſaid of all the other timbers ; and if ſeveral ribband
                    lines be formed, they may be ſo contrived that their diagonals in the body plan
                    ſhall be at ſuch diſtances, that a point for every timber being given in each
                    diagonal, will be ſufficient to determine the form of all the timbers.</p>
                <p>In ſtationing the timbers upon the keel for a boat, there muſt be room for two
                    futtocks in the ſpace before or abaft ; for which reaſon, the diſtance between
                    theſe two timbers will be as much more than that between the other as the timber
                    is broad. Here it is between ⊕ and (A); which contains the diſtances between ⊕
                    and (1), and the breadth of the timber beſides.</p>
                <p>The timbers being now formed, and proved by ribband and water lines, proceed then
                    to form the tranſom, faſhion-pieces, &amp;c. by Problem VI.</p>
                <p>This method of whole-moulding will not anſwer for the long timbers afore and
                    abaft. They are generally canted in the ſame manner as thoſe for a ſhip. In
                    order to render this method more complete, we ſhall here deſcribe the manner of
                    moulding the timbers after they are laid down in the mould loft, by a riſing
                    ſquare, bend, and hollow mould.</p>
                <p>It was ſhown before how to form the timbers by the bend and hollow moulds on the
                    draught. The ſame method muſt be uſed in the loſe ; but the moulds muſt be made
                    to their proper ſcantlings in real feet and inches. Now when they are set, as
                    before directed, for moulding each timber, let the middle line in the body plan
                    be drawn acroſs the bend mould, and draw a line acroſs the hollow mould at the
                    point where it touches the upper edge of the keel ; and let them be marked with
                    the proper name of the timber, as in fig. 40. The graduations of the bend mould
                    will therefore be exactly the ſame as the narrowing of the breadth. Thus, the
                    diſtance between ⊗ and 7 on the bend mould is equal to the difference between
                    the half breadth of timber 7 and that of ⊕. The height of the head of each
                    timber is likewiſe marked on the bend mould, and alſo the floor and breadth
                    ſirmarks. The floor ſirmark is in that point where a ſtraight edged batten
                    touches the back of the bend mould, the batten being so placed<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0413.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0407"/> as to touch
                    the lower edge of the keel at the same time. The ſeveral risings of the floor
                    and heights of the cutting down line are marked on the rising ſquare, and the
                    half breadth of the keel ſet off from the side of it.</p>
                <p>The moulds being thus prepared, we ſhall apply them to mould timber 7. The timber
                    being firſt properly ſided to its breadth, lay the bend mould upon it, ſo as may
                    beſt anſwer the round according to the grain of the wood ; then lay the rising
                    ſquare to the bottom of the bend mould, ſo that the line drawn acroſs the bend
                    mould at timber 7 may coincide with the line repreſenting the middle of the keel
                    upon the riſing ſquare ; and draw a line upon the timber by the side of the
                    ſquare, or let the line be ſcored or cut by a tool made for that purpoſe, called
                    a <hi rend="italic">raſeing knife</hi><note anchored="true" n="10"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(e)</hi> The term

                    <hi rend="italic">(</hi>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">e</hi>) ; this line ſo raſed will be the side of the keel.
                    Then the ſquare muſt be moved till the side of it comes to 7 on the bend mould,
                    and another line muſt be raſed in by the side of it to repreſent the middle of
                    the keel. The other side of the keel muſt likewiſe be raſed after the ſame
                    manner, and the point 7 on the riſing ſquare be marked on each side of the keel,
                    and a line raſed acroſs at theſe points to repreſent the upper edge oſ the keel.
                    From this line the height of the cutting down line at 7 muſt be ſet up, and then
                    the riſing ſquare may be taken away, and the timber may be raſed by the bend
                    mould, both inſide and outſide, from the head to the floor firmark ; or it may
                    be carried lower if neceſſary. After the ſirmarks and head of the timbers are
                    marked, the bend mould may likewiſe be taken away, and then the hollow mould
                    applied to the back of the ſweep in ſuch a manner that the point 7 upon it may
                    interſect the upper side of the keel, before ſet off by the riſing ſquare ; and
                    when in this poſition the timber may be raſed by it, which will complete the
                    outſide of the timbers. The inſide of the timbers may likewiſe be formed by the
                    hollow mould. The ſcantling at the keel is given by the cutting down before ſet
                    off. The mould muſt be ſo placed as to touch the ſweep of the inſide of the
                    timber formed before by the bend mould, and paſs through the cutting down
                    point.</p>
                <p>The uſe of the ſirmarks is to find the true places of the futtocks ; for as they
                    are cut off three or four inches ſhort of the keel, they muſt be ſo placed that
                    the futtock and floor ſirmarks may be compared and coincide. Notwithſtanding
                    which, if the timbers are not very carefully trimmed, the head of the futtock
                    may be either within or without its proper half breadth ; to prevent which a
                    half breadth ſtaff is made uſe of.</p>
                <p>The half breadth ſtaff may be one inch ſquare, and of any convenient length. Upon
                    one side of it are ſet off from one end the ſeveral half breadths of all the
                    timbers in the after body, and thoſe of the fore body upon the oppoſite side. On
                    the other two ſides are ſet off the ſeveral heights of the ſheer, the after body
                    on one side, and the fore body on its oppoſite. Two ſides of the ſtaff are
                    marked <hi rend="italic">half breadths,</hi> and the other two ſides <hi
                        rend="italic">heights oſ the ſheer.</hi></p>
                <p>The ſtaff being thus prepared, and the floor-timbers faſtened on the keel, and
                    levelled acroſs, the futtocks muſt next be faſtened to the floor timbers ; but
                    they muſt be ſet firſt to their proper half breadth and height. The half breadth
                    ſtaff, with the aſſiſtance of the ram line<note anchored="true" n="11" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* See next Chapter.</p>
                    </note> *, ſerves to ſet them to the half breadth : for as the keel of a boat is
                    generally perpendicular to the horizon, therefore the line at which the plummet
                    is ſuſpended, and which is moveable on the ram line, will be perpendicular to
                    the keel. Whence we may by it ſet the timbers perpendicular to the keel, and
                    then ſet them to their proper half breadths by the ſtaff : and when the two
                    ſirmarks coincide, the futtock will be at its proper height, and may be nailed
                    to the floor timbers, and alſo to the breadth ribband, which may be ſet to the
                    height of the ſheer by a level laid acroſs, taking the height of the ſheer by
                    the ſtaff from the upper ſide of the keel ; by which means we ſhall diſcover if
                    the ribband is exactly the height oſ the sheer ; and if not, the true height may
                    be ſet off by a pair of compaſſes from the level, and marked on the timbers.</p>

                    propoſed ſhip being laid down on paper, we muſt next proceed to lay down theſe
                    ſeveral plans on the mould loft of the real dimenſions of the ſhip propoſed to
                    be built, and from which moulds for each ſeparate part are to be made. The
                    method of laying down theſe plans, from what has been already ſaid, will, it is
                    preſumed, be no very difficult taſk to accompliſh, as it is no more than
                    enlarging the dimenſions of the original draughts ; and with reſpect to the
                    moulds, they are very eaſily formed agreeable to the figure of the ſeveral parts
                    of the ſhip laid down in the mould loft.</p>
                <p>Blocks of wood are now to be prepared upon which the keel is to be laid. Theſe
                    blocks are to be placed at nearly equal diſtances, as of five or six feet, and
                    in ſuch a manner that their upper ſurfaces may be exactly in the ſame plane, and
                    their middle in the ſame ſtraight line. This laſt is eaſily done by means of a
                    line ſtretched a little more than the propoſed length of the keel ; and the
                    upper planes of theſe blocks may be verified by a long and ſtraight rule ; and
                    the utmoſt care and precaution muſt be taken to have theſe blocks properly
                    bedded. Each block may be about six or eight inches longer than the keel is in
                    thickneſs ; their breadth from 12 to 14 inches, and. their depth from a foot to
                    a foot and half.</p>
                <p>The dimenſions of the keel are to be taken from the mould loft, and the keel is
                    to be prepared accordingly. As, however, it is ſeldom poſſible to procure a
                    piece of wood of ſufficient length ſor a keel, eſpecially if for a large ſhip,
                    it is, therefore, for the moſt part neceſſary to compoſe it of ſeveral pieces,
                    and theſe pieces are to be ſcarſed together, and ſecurely bolted, ſo as to make
                    one entire piece. It muſt, however, be obſerved, that the pieces which compoſe
                    the keel ought to be of ſuch lengths, that a ſcarf may not be oppoſite to the
                    ſtep of any of the maſts. Rabbets are to be formed on each ſide of the keel to

                <p>The ſtem, and the poſt, and the ſeveral tranſoms belonging to it, are to be
                    prepared from the moulds, and rabbeted in like manner as the keel, to receive
                    the ends of the plank. The tranſoms are to be bolted to the poſt at their
                    middle, each at its reſpective height, taken from the elevation in the mould
                    loft, and the extremities of the tranſoms are to be firmly connected with the
                    faſhion-pieces. Both ſtem and poſt are then to be erected, each at its
                    reſpective extremity of the keel. The tenons at the heel of each being let into
                    mortiſes prepared to receive them, and being ſet to their proper rakes or angles
                    with the keel, are to be ſupported by props or ſhores. Pieces of wood called
                    dead wood are to be laid upon and fixed to the upper side of the keel towards
                    the fore and aft parts of it ; the deepneſs of the dead wood increaſing with its
                    diſtance from the middle, agreeable to the propoſed form of the cutting down
                    line.</p>
                <p>A line is to be ſtretched from the middle of the head of the ſtem to that of the
                    poſt, called the ram line, upon which is a moveable line with a plummet affixed
                    to it. The midſhip and other frames are to be erected upon the keel at their
                    proper stations. The extremities of each frame are ſet at equal diſtances from
                    the vertical longitudinal ſection of the ſhip, by moving the frame in its own
                    plane until the plumb-line coincides with a mark at the middle between the arms
                    of each frame ; and although the keel is inclined to the horizon, yet the frames
                    may alſo be ſet perpendicular to the keel by means of the plumb-line. The ſhores
                    which are ſupporting the frames are now to be ſecurely fixed, that the poſition
                    of the frames may not be altered. The ribbands are now to be nailed to the
                    frames at their proper places, the more effectually to ſecure them ; and the
                    intermediate vacancies between the frames filled up with filling timbers. For a

                <p>The frames being now ſtationed, proceed next to fix on the planks, of which the
                    wales are the principal, being much thicker and ſtronger than the rest, as is
                    repreſented in the midſhip frame, Plate CCCXIV. The harpins, which may be
                    conſidered as a continuation of the wales at their fore ends, are fixed acroſs
                    the hawſe pieces, and ſurround the fore part of the ſhip. The planks that
                    incloſe the ſhip’s ſides are then brought about the timbers ; and the clamps,
                    which are of equal thickneſs with the wales, fixed oppoſite to the wales within
                    the ſhip. Theſe are uſed to ſupport the ends of the beams, and accordingly
                    ſtretch from one end of the ſhip to the other. The thick fluff or ſtrong planks
                    of the bottom within board are then placed oppoſite to the ſeveral ſcarfs of the
                    timbers, to reinforce them throughout the ſhip’s length. The planks employed to
                    line the ſhip, called the ceiling or foot-waling, is next fixed in the intervals
                    between the thick ſtuff of the hold. The beams are afterwards laid acroſs the
                    ſhip to ſupport the decks, and are connected to the side by lodging andanging
                    knees : the former of which are exhibited at F, Plate CLVI. See alſo the article

                    then laid on the ends of the beams throughout the ſhip’s length, and the
                    ſpirketing fixed cloſe above them.— The upper deck is then planked, and the
                    string placed under the gunnel, or plansheer, in the waiſt. The diſpoſition of
                    thoſe latter pieces on the timbers, viz. the water-ways, ſpirketing, upper deck,
                    ſtring, and gunnel, are alſo repreſented in the midſhip frame, Plate CCCIV.</p>
                <p>Then proceed next to plank the quarter-deck and forecaſtle, and to fix the
                    partners of the malts and cap- ſterns with the coamings of the hatches. The
                    breast- hooks are then bolted acroſs the ſtem and bow within- board, the ſtep of
                    the foremaſt placed on the kelſon, and the riders, exhibited in the Midship
                    Frame, fayed to the inside of the timbers, to reinforce the ſides in different
                    parts of the ship's length. The pointers, if any, are afterwards fixed acroſs
                    the hold diagonally to ſupport the beams ; and the crotches ſtationed in the
                    after hold to unite the half timbers. The steps of the mainmaſt and capſterns
                    are next placed ; the planks of the lower decks and orlop laid ; the navel-hoods
                    fayed to the hawſe holes ; and the knees of the head, or cutwater, connected to
                    the ſtern. The figure of the head is then erected, and the trail-board and
                    cheeks fixed on the side of the knee.</p>
                <p>The tassarel and quarter-pieces, which terminate the ſhip abaft, the former above
                    and the latter on each side, are then diſpoſed, and the ſtern and quarter
                    galleries framed and ſupported by their brackets. The pumps, with their well,
                    are next fixed in the hold ; the limber boards laid on each side of the kelſon,
                    and the garboard strake fixed on the ſhip’s bottom next to the heel without.</p>
                <p>The hull being thus fabricated, proceed to ſeparate the apartments by bulkheads
                    or partitions, to frame the port-lids, to fix the catheads and cheſs-trees ; to
                    form the hatchways and ſcuttles, and fit them with proper covers or gratings.
                    Next fix the ladders at the different hatchways, and build the manger on the
                    lower deck, to carry off the water that runs in at the hawſe- holes when the
                    ſhip rides at anchor in a ſea. The bread-room and magazines are there lined ;
                    and the gunnel, rails, and gangways fixed on the upper part of the ſhip. The
                    cleats, kevels, and ranges, by which the ropes are faſtened, are afterwards
                    bolted or nailed to the ſides in different places.</p>
                <p>The rudder, being fitted with its irons, is next hung to the ſtern-poſt, and the
                    tiller or bar, by which it is managed, let into a mortiſe at its upper end.

                <p>“ Among the various accidents which ſhips are liable to at ſea, none call more
                    for the attention and exertion of the officer than the ſpeedy refitting of the
                    maſts ; and having obſerved, in the courſe of laſt war, the very great
                    deſtruction made among the lower maſts of our ſhips from the enemy’s mode of
                    fighting, as well as the very great expence and delay in refitting a fleet after
                    an action, particularly acroſs the Atlantic—a very ſimple expedient has
                    ſuggeſted itſelf to me as a reſource in part ; which appears ſo very ſpeedy and
                    ſecure, that the capacity of the meaneſt ſailor will at once conceive it. I
                    therefore think it my duty to ſtate my ideas of the advantages likely to reſult
                    from it ; and I ſhall feel myſelf exceedingly happy ſhould they in anywiſe
                    contribute to remedy the evil.</p>
                <p>“ My plan, therefore, is, to have the heels of all lower maſts ſo formed as to
                    become the heads : but it is not the intention of the above plan to have the
                    ſmalleſt alteration made in the heels of the preſent lower maſts ; for as all
                    line-of-battle ſhips maſts are nine inches in diameter larger at the heel than
                    at the head, it will follow, that by letting in the treſſel-trees to their
                    proper depth, the maſt will form its own cheeks or hounds ; and I flatter myſelf
                    the following advantages will reſult from the above alteration.</p>
                <p>Firſt, I must beg to obſerve, that all line-of-battle ſhips bury one-third of
                    their lower maſts, particularly three-deckers ; it therefore follows, that if
                    the wounds are in the upper third, by turning the maſt ſo as to make the heel
                    the head, it will be as good as new ; for, in eight actions I was preſent in
                    laſt war, I made the following obſervations:</p>
                <p>“ That in the ſaid actions fifty-eight lower maſts were wounded, and obliged to
                    be ſhifted, thirty-two of which had their wounds in the upper third, and of
                    courſe the ſhips detained until new maſts were made. And when it is conſidered
                    that a lower maſt for a 90 or 74 ſtands government in a ſum not leſs, I am
                    informed, than 2000 l. to 2300 l. the advantages acroſs the Atlantic reſulting
                    from the aforeſaid plan will be particularly obvious ; not to mention the
                    probability of there being no fit ſpars in the country, which was the caſe
                    in</p>
                <p>the inſtances of the Iſis and Princeſs Royal; and as I was one of the lieutenants
                    of the Iſis at that time, I am more particular in the circumſtance of that,
                    ſhip. The Iſis had both her lower maſts wounded above the cathar pins in her
                    action with the Cæſar, a French 74 ; and as there were no ſpars at New York, the
                    Iſis was detained five weeks at that place.— Now, if her maſts had been fitted
                    on the plan I have propoſed, I am confident ſhe would have been ready for ſea in
                    48 hours ; and as a further proof, I beg leave to add, that the whole fleet, on
                    the glorious 12th of April, had not the leaſt accident of any conſequence except
                    what befel their lower maſts, which detained them between eight and ten weeks at
                    Jamaica.</p>
                <p>“ The delay of a ſhip while a new maſt is making, and probably the fleet being
                    detained for want of that ſhip, which frequently occurred in the courſe of laſt
                    war, the taking of ſhipwrights from other work, with a variety of inconveniences
                    not neceſſary to mention here, muſt be obvious to every officer that has made
                    the ſmalleſt obſervations on ſea actions.</p>
                <p>“ You will further obſerve, that this ſubſtſtute is formed on the most ſimple
                    principle, fitted to the meaneſt capacity, and calculated to benefit all ſhips,
                    from a firſt-rate down to the ſmalleſt merchantman, in caſes of an accident by
                    ſhot, a ſpring, a rottenneſs, particularly as theſe accidents generally happen
                    in the upper third of the maſt and above the cheeks.</p>
                <p>“ It might probably be objected, that a difficulty and ſome danger might ariſe
                    from the wounded part of the maſt being below ; but this will at once be
                    obviated, when it is remembered, that as the wounded part is below the wedges,
                    it may with eaſe be both fiſhed, caſed, and ſecured, to any ſize or degree you
                    pleaſe, with the addition of its being wedged on each deck.”</p>

                    repreſenting its thickneſs at the different divisions.</p>

                    let into their proper depth, the additional thickneſs of the maſt forming its
                    own cheeks.</p>
                <p>Fig. 43. the propoſed maſt, the figures repreſenting the thickneſs of the maſt in
                    the propoſed alterations ; <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the heel made ſquare ; <hi
                        rend="italic">b,</hi> the letting in of the treſſel- trees ; <hi
                        rend="italic">c,</hi> the third proportion of thickneſs continued up to
                    where the fourth is in the preſent maſt, or at leaſt ſome little diſtance above
                    the lower part of the cheeks, which is always looked upon as the weakest part of
                    the maſt ; and by its being ſo proportioned, the maſt, when turned, will be
                    nearly as ſtrong in the partners as before.</p>
                <p>As the expence of a maſt is much greater than is generally imagined, it is
                    therefore thought proper to ſubjoin the following ſtatement of the ſeveral

                <p>In order to leſſen the enormous expence of masts, a propoſal was made ſome years
                    ago to conſtruct them hollow; and the author having premiſed ſeveral experiments
                    which he had made, proceeds as follows:<note anchored="false" n="15" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Princples of Naval Architecture,</hi> p. 50.</p>

                <p>“ Galileo taught us, that the reſiſtance or ſtrength of a hollow cylinder is to
                    that of a full cylinder, containing the ſame quantity of matter, as the total
                    diameter of the hollow one is to the diameter of the full one; and theſe
                    experiments ſhow us, that the ſtrength or reſiſtance of two or more pieces of
                    wood, faſtened together at each end, and connected by a pillar, pillars, or
                    framing, increaſes, at leaſt to a certain degreee, caeteris paribus, as the
                    diſtance between them and number of pillars, provided the force is applied in
                    the line or direction of the pillars.</p>
                <p>“ It is ſurprising that this diſcovery of Galileo has not been made ſubſervient
                    to more uſeful purpoſes. It is particularly applicable to the construction of
                    maſts, as not requiring that the hollow cylinder ſhould be made of one solid
                    piece of wood<note anchored="true" n="16" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(g)
                            The ſtrength of theſe cylinders would be ſtill further augmented by
                            having ſolid pieces of wood placed within them at proper diſtances, and
                            ſecurely faſtened to them, in the ſame manner, and on the ſame
                            principles, that nature has furniſhed reeds with joints ; and for
                            anſwering, in ſome reſpects, the same purpoſe as the pillars in the
                            experiments alluded to.</p></note> (g).</p>
                <p>“ However, the foregoing experiments teach us, that the ſame advantages may be
                    obtained by other forms beſides that of a cylinder ; and that perhaps not only
                    in a ſuperior degree, but likewiſe with greater facility of execution ; as by
                    adopting a ſquare figure, but more particularly by eonſtructing them of ſeparate
                    pieces of wood, placed at proper diſtances from each other, in the following or
                    any other manner that may be found moſt convenient. Fig. 44, 45, and 46, exhibit
                    each the tranſverſe ſection of a maſt, in which the ſmall circles repreſent the
                    trees or upright pieces of wood, and</p>
                <p>the lines the beams or framing of wood, which are employed at proper places and
                    at proper diſtances from each other, for connecting them together. Perhaps ſolid
                    frames of wood, placed at proper diſtances from each other, and filling up the
                    whole dotted ſpace, would anſwer better ; in which event, the maſt could be
                    ſtrongly hooped with iron at thoſe places, and the upright trees formed ſquare,
                    or of any other convenient form.</p>
                <p>“ It will be evident to thoſe acquainted with this ſubject, that ſuch maſts would
                    be greatly ſtronger than common ones containing the ſame quantity of materials.
                    It is likewiſe evident that they would be leſs apt to ſpring, as being ſupported
                    on a more extended baſe, and affording many conveniences for being better
                    ſecured ; and that they might be conſtructed of ſuch wood as at preſent would be
                    deemed altogether improper for maſts : a circumſtance of importance to Britain
                    at all times, but more particularly now, when there is ſuch difficulty in
                    procuring wood proper for the kind of maſts in common uſe.”</p>
                <p>An improvement in the rudder has lately taken place in ſeveral ſhips,
                    particularly in ſome of thoſe in the ſervice of the Eaſt India company. It will,
                    however, be neceſſary previouſly to deſcribe the uſual form of the rudder, in
                    order to ſhow the advantages it poſſeſſes when conſtructed agreeable to the
                    improved method.</p>
                <p>N⁰ I. (fig. 47) repreſents the rudder according to the common method of
                    conſtruction ; in which AB is the axis of rotation. It is hence evident that a
                    ſpace conſiderably greater than the tranſverſe ſection of the rudder at the
                    counter muſt be left in the counter for the rudder to revolve in. Thus, let CAB
                    (n⁰ 3.) be the ſection of the rudder at the counter ; then there muſt be a ſpace
                    ſimilar to CDE in the counter, in order that the rudder may be moveable as
                    required. Hence, to prevent the water from waſhing up the rudder caſe, a rudder
                    coat, that is, a piece of tarred canvas, is nailed in ſuch a manner to the
                    rudder and counter as to cover the intermediate ſpace : but the canvas being
                    continually waſhed by the ſea, ſoon becomes brittle, and unable to yield to the
                    various turns of the rudder without breaking ; in which caſe the ſhip is of
                    courſe left pervious to the waves, even of three or four feet high ; in fact,
                    there are few men bred to the ſea who have not been witneſſes to the bad effects
                    of ſuch a ſpace being left ſo ill guarded againſt the ſtroke of the waves ; and
                    many ſhips have, with great probability, been ſuppoſed to founder at ſea from
                    the quantity of water ſhipped between the rudder and counter.</p>
                <p>It was to remedy this defect that the alteration above alluded to took place ;
                    which conſiſts in making the upper part AEG (fig. 48, n⁰ 1.) of the rudder ABD
                    cylindrical, and giving that part at the ſame time a caſt forward, ſo that the
                    axis of rotation may by that means be the line AD, palling as uſual from E to
                    E), through the centres of the braces which attach the rudder to the ſtern-poſt,
                    and from E to A through the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0417.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0411"/> axis the cylinder AFG, in order that the
                    tranſverſe ſection KH (n <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 2.) at the counter may
                    be a circle revolving upon its centre ; in which caſe the ſpace of halt an inch
                    is more than ſufficient between the rudder and the counter, and conſequently the
                    neceſſity of a rudder coat entirely done away. But as it was fore- ſeen, that if
                    the rudder by any accident was unſhipped, this alteration might endanger the
                    tearing away of the counter, the hole is made much larger than the tranſverſe
                    ſection of the cylindric part of the rudder, and the ſpace between filled up
                    with pieces of wood ſo fitted to the counter as to be capable of withſtanding
                    the ſhock of the ſea, but to be easily carried away with the rudder, leaving the
                    counter, under ſuch circumſtances, in as ſafe a ſtate as it would be agreeable
                    in the preſent form of making rudders in the navy.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> VIII. <hi rend="italic">Upon the Positiοn of the
                        Load water Line, and the Capacity of a Ship.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">The</hi> weight of the quantity of water diſplaced by the
                    bottom of a ſhip is equal to the weight of the ſhip with its rigging,
                    provisions, and every thing on board. If therefore the exact weight of the ſhip
                    when ready for ſea be calculated, and alſo the number of cubic feet in the
                    ſhip’s bottom below the load-water line, and hence the weight of the water she
                    diſplaces ; it will be known if the load-water line is properly placed in the
                    draught.</p>
                <p>The poſition of the ſhip in the draught may be either on an even keel, or to draw
                    moſt water abaft ; but an even keel is judged to be the beſt poſition in point
                    of velocity, when the ſhip is conſtructed ſuitable thereto, that is, when her
                    natural poſition is ſuch. For when a ſhip is conſtructed to ſwim by the ſtern,
                    and when brought down to her load-water made to ſwim on an even keel (as is the
                    caſe with moſt ships that are thus built), her velocity is by that means greatly
                    retarded, and alſo her ſtrength greatly diminiſhed : for the forepart being
                    brought down lower than it ſhould be, and the middle of the ſhip maintaining its
                    proper depth in the water, the after part is by that means lifted, and the ſhip
                    is then upon an even keel : but in conſequence of her being out of her natural
                    poſition, the after part is always preſſing downwards with a conſiderable
                    ſtrain, which will continue till the ſhip’s ſheer is entirely broke, and in time
                    would fall into its natural poſition again : for which reaſon we ſee ſo many
                    ſhips with broken backs, that is, with their ſheers altered in ſuch a manner
                    that the ſheer rounds up, and the highest part is in the midſhips.</p>
                <p>Such are the diſadvantages ariſing from not paying a due attention to thoſe
                    points in the conſtruction of a draught ; therefore, when the load-water line is
                    found to be ſo situated at a proper height on the draught, according to the
                    weight given for ſuch a ſhip, and alſo drawn parallel to the keel, as ſuppoſing
                    that to be the beſt ſailing trim, the next thing is to examine whether the body
                    is conſtructed ſuitable thereto, in order to avoid the above-mentioned ill
                    conſequences.</p>
                <p>In the firſt place, therefore, we muſt divide the ſhip equally in two lengthwiſe
                    between the fore and after perpendiculars; and the exact number of cubic feet in
                    the whole bottom beneath the load-water line being</p>
                <p>known, we muſt find whether the number of cubic feet in each part ſo divided are
                    the ſame ; and if they are found to be equal, the body of the ſhip may then he
                    ſaid to be conſtructed in all reſpects ſuitable to her ſwimming on an even keel,
                    let the ſhape of the body be whatever it will ; and which will be found to be
                    her natural poſition at the load-water line. But if either of the parts ſhould
                    contain a greater number of cubic feet than the other, that part which contains
                    the greatest will ſwim the moſt out of the water, and consequently the other
                    will ſwim deepeſt, ſuppoſing the ſhip in her natural poſition for that
                    conſtruction. In order, therefore, to render the ſhip ſuitably conſtructed to
                    the load-water line in the draught, which is parallel to the keel, the number of
                    cubic feet in the leſs part muſt be ſubtracted from the number contained in the
                    greater part, and that part of the body is to be filled out tilt it has
                    increaſed half the difference of their quantities, and the other part is to be
                    drawn in as much : hence the two parts will be equal, that is, each will contain
                    the ſame number of cubic feet, and the ſhip’s body will be conſtructed in a
                    manner ſuitable to her ſwimming on an even keel.</p>
                <p>If it is propoſed that the ſhip laid down on the draught ſhall not ſwim on an
                    even keel, but draw more water abaft than afore, then the fore and after parts
                    of the ſhip’s body below the load-water line are to be compared ; and if theſe
                    parts are unequal, that part which is leaſt is to be filled out by half the
                    difference, and the other part drawn in as much as before.</p>
                <p>It will be neceſſary, in the firſt place, to calculate the weight of a ſhip ready
                    equipped for ſea, from the knowledge of the weight of every ſeparate thing in
                    her and belonging to her, as the exact weight of all the timber, iron, lead,
                    maſts, sails, rigging, and in ſhort all the materials, men, proviſions, and
                    every thing elſe on board of her, from which we ſhall be able afterwards to
                    judge of the truth of the calculation, and whether the load-water line in the
                    draught be placed agreeable thereto. This is indeed a very laborious taſk, upon
                    account of the ſeveral pieces of timber, &amp;c. being of ſo many different
                    figures, and the ſpecific gravity of some of the timber entering the
                    conſtruction not being preciſely determined.</p>
                <p>In order to aſcertain the weight of the hull, the timber is the firſt thing which
                    comes under conſideration : the number of cubic feet of timber contained in the
                    whole fabric muſt be found ; which we ſhall be able to do by help of the draught
                    and the principal dimensions and ſcantlings ; obſerving to diſtinguiſh the
                    different kinds of timber from each other, as they differ considerably in weight
                    ; then the number of cubic feet contained in the different forts of timber being
                    reduced into pounds, and added, will be the weight of the timber. In like manner
                    proceed to find the weight of the iron, lead, paint, &amp;c. and the true weight
                    of the whole will be found.</p>
                <p>In reducing quantity to weight, it may be obſerved that a cubic foot of oak is
                    equal to 66 pounds, and the ſpeciſic gravity of the other materials are as

                <p>Agreeable to the above eſtimate, we find that the eighty gun ſhip, with every
                    thing on board and fit for ſea, when brought down to the load water line, weighs
                    8,182,463 pounds, or nearly 3653 tons. It may now be known if the load water
                    line in the draught be properly placed, by reducing the immerſed part of the
                    body into cubic feet. For if the eighty gun ſhip, when brought down to the load
                    water line, weighs 3653 tons, the quantity of water diſplaced muſt alſo be 3653
                    tons : now a cubic foot of ſalt water being ſuppoſed to weigh 74 pounds, if
                    therefore 8182463 be divided by 74, the quotient is 110573, the number of
                    cubical feet which she muſt diſplace agreeable to her weight.</p>
                <p>It is now neceſſary to find the number of cubic feet contained in the ſhip’s
                    bottom below the load water line by calculation. If the bottom was a regular
                    ſolid, this might be very eaſily done ; but as it is otherwiſe, we muſt be
                    ſatisfied with the following method by approximation, firſt given by M.
                    Bouguer.</p>
                <p>Take the lengths of every other of the lines that repreſent the frames in the
                    horizontal plane upon the upper water line ; then find the ſum of theſe
                    together, with half the foremoſt and aftermoſt frames. Now multiply that ſum by
                    the diſtance between the frames, and the product is the area of the water line
                    contained between the foremoſt and aftermoſt frames: then find the area of that
                    part abaft the after frame, which forms a trapezium, and alſo the poſt and
                    rudder ; find alſo the area of that part afore the foremaſt frame, and alſo of
                    the ſtem and gripe ; then theſe areas being added to that firſt found, and the
                    ſum doubled, will be the area of the ſurface of the whole water line. The reaſon
                    of this rule will be obvious to thoſe acquainted with the firſt principles of
                    mathematics.</p>
                <p>The areas of the other water line may be found in the same manner : then the ſum
                    of all theſe areas, except that of the uppermoſt and lowermoſt, of which only
                    one half of each muſt be taken, being multiplied by the diſtance between the
                    water lines (theſe lines in the plane of elevation being equidiſtant from each
                    other), and the product will be the ſolid content of the ſpace contained between
                    the lower and load water lines.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0419.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0413"/> Add the area of the lower water line to the area
                    of the upper side of the keel ; multiply half that ſum by the diſtance between
                    them, the product will be the ſolid content of that part between the lower water
                    line and upper edge of the keel, ſupposing them parallel to each other. But if
                    the lower water line is not parallel to the keel, the above half ſum is to be
                    multiplied by the diſtance between them at the middle of the ſhip.</p>
                <p>The ſolid contents of the keel muſt be next found, by multiplying its length by
                    its depth, and that product by the breadth. Then the ſum of theſe ſolid contents
                    will be the number of cubic feet contained in the immerſed part of the ſhip’s
                    bottom, or that part below the load water line.</p>
                <p>Determination oſ the number of Cubic Feet contained in the Bottom oſ the Eighty
                    Gun Ship, See Plates CCCCLX. and CCCCLXI.</p>
                <p>The fore body is divided into five, and the after body into ten, equal parts in
                    the horizontal plane ; beſides the parts contained between the foremoſt timber
                    and the item, and the aftermoſt timber and the poſt. The plane of elevation is
                    alſo divided into five equal parts by water lines drawn parallel to the keel.
                    Theſe water lines are alſo deſcribed upon the horizontal plane.</p>
                <p>It is to be obſerved that there muſt be five inches added to each line that
                    repreſents a frame in the horizontal plane for the thickneſs of the plank, that
                    being nearly a mean between the thickneſs of the plank next the water and that
                    on the lower part of the bottom.</p>

                <p>As the weight of the ſhip, with every thing on board, found by this calculation,
                    is equal to that found by eſtimate ; it hence appears that the water line is
                    properly placed in the draught. It now only remains to find whether the body is
                    constructed ſuitably thereto, that is, whether the ſhip will be in her natural
                    poſition when brought down to that line. For this purpoſe a perpendicular muſt
                    be erected 27 feet <hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi rend="subscript"> 4</hi>
                    inch, abaft dead flat, which will be the middle between the two perpendiculars
                    and the place where the centre of gravity ſhould fall, that the ſhip may ſwim on
                    an even keel. The ſolidity of that part of the bottom contained between the ſaid
                    perpendicular and dead flat is then to be calculated, which will be found to be
                    25846 feet 7 inches.</p>

                    has received an addition of 7083 feet, and the fore part muſt be drawn in till

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">This</hi> is a queſtion of equal importance and difficulty.
                    By the tonnage of a ſhip is meant the weight of every thing that can with ſafety
                    and expediency be taken on board that ſhip for the purpoſe of conveyance: it is
                    alſo called the s <hi rend="italic">hip's burthen ;</hi> and it is totally
                    different from the weight of the whole as she floats in the water. It is perhaps
                    beſt expreſſed by calling it the <hi rend="italic">weight of the cargo.</hi> It
                    is of importance, becauſe it is by this that the merchant or freighter judges of
                    the fitneſs<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0422.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0416"/> of
                    the ſhip for his purpoſe. By this government judge <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                    ſhips requiſite for tranſport ſervice, and by this are all revenue charges on
                    the ſhip computed. It is no leſs difficult to anſwer this queſtion by any
                    general rule which ſhall be very exact, becauſe it depends not only on the
                    cubical dimenſions of the ſhip’s bottom, but alſo on the ſcantling of her whole
                    frame, and in ſhort on the weight of every thing which properly makes part of a
                    ſhip ready to receive on board her cargo. The weight of timber is variable ; the
                    ſcantling of the frame is no leſs ſo. We muſt therefore be contented with an
                    average value which is not very remote from the truth ; and this average is to
                    be obtained, not by any mathematical diſcuſſion, but by obſervation of the
                    burthen or cargo actually received, in a great variety of cases. But ſome fort
                    of rule of calculation muſt be made out. This is and muſt be done by perſons not
                    mathematicians. We may therefore expect to find it incapable of being reduced to
                    any principle, and that every builder will have a different rule. Accordingly
                    the rules given for this purpoſe are in general very whimſical, measures being
                    uſed and combined in a way that ſeems quite unconnected with ſtercometry or the
                    meaſurement of solids. The rules for calculation are even affected by the
                    intereſts of the two parties oppoſitely concerned in the reſult. The calculation
                    for the tonnage by which the cuſtoms are to be exacted by government are quite
                    different from the rule by which the tonnage of a transport hired by government
                    is computed ; and the ſame ſhip hired as a tranſport will be computed near one
                    half bigger than when paying importation duties.</p>
                <p>Yet the whole of this might be made a very simple buſineſs and very exact. When
                    the ſhip is launched, let her light-water line be marked, and this with the
                    cubical contents of the immerſed part be noted down, and be engroſſed in the
                    deed by which the property of the ſhip is conveyed from hand to hand. The weight
                    of her maſts, sails, rigging, and ſea-ſtores, is moſt eaſily obtained ; and
                    every builder can compute the cubical contents of the body when immerſed to the
                    load water line. The difference of theſe is unqueſtionably the burthen of the
                    ſhip.</p>
                <p>It is evident from what has been already ſaid in the laſt chapter, that if the
                    number of cubic feet of water which the ſhip diſplaces when light, or, which is
                    the ſame, the number of cubic feet below the light water line, found by the
                    preceding method of calculation, be ſubtracted from the number of cubic feet
                    contained in the bottom below the load water line, and the remainder reduced to
                    tons by multiplying by 74, the number of pounds in a cubic foot of ſea water,
                    and divided by 2240, the number of pounds in a ton, the quotient will be the
                    tonnage.</p>
                <p>But as this method is very troubleſome, the following rule for this purpoſe is
                    that which is uſed in the king’s and merchant’s ſervice.</p>
                <p>Let fall a perpendicular from the foreſide of the ſtem at the height of the hawſe
                        holes<note anchored="true" n="17" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi
                                rend="smallcaps">( h</hi>) In the merchant ſervice this
                            perpendicular is let fall from the fore ſide of the ſtem at the height
                            of the wing tranſom, by reaſon of the hawſe-holes being generally ſo
                            very high in merchant ſhips, and their ſtems alſo having a great rake
                            forward.</p></note>
                    <hi rend="smallcaps">(h),</hi> and another perpendicular from the back of the
                    main poſt at the height</p>
                <p>of the wing tranſom. From the length between theſe two perpendiculars deduct
                    three-fifths of the extreme breadth<note anchored="true" n="18" place="bottom"
                        type="authorial"><p>(I) The breadth understood in this place is the breadth
                            from outside to outſide of the plank.</p></note> (I), and alſo as many
                    times 2 ½ inches as there are feet in the height of the wing tranſom above the
                    upper edge of the keel ; the remainder is the length of the keel for tonnage.
                    Now multiply this length by the extreme breadth, and the product by half the
                    extreme breadth, and this laſt product divided by 94 is the tonnage
                    required.</p>
                <p>Or, multiply the length of the keel for tonnage by the ſquare of the extreme
                    breadth, and the product divided by 188 will give the tonnage.</p>

                <p>Hence an eighty gun ſhip will not carry the tonnage ſhe is rated at by about 95
                    tons. As the body of this ſhip is fuller than in ſhips of war in general, there
                    is therefore a nearer agreement between the tonnages found by the two different
                    methods. It may be obſerved that ſhips of war carry leſs tonnage than they are

                <p>The impropriety of the common rule is hence manifeſt, as there can be no
                    dependence on it for aſcertaining the tonnage of veſſels.</p>
                <p>We ſhall now ſubjoin the following experimental method of finding the tonnage of
                    a ſhip.</p>
                <p>Conſtruct a model agreeable to the draught of the propoſed ſhip, to a ſcale of
                    about one-fourth of an inch to a foot, and let the light and load water lines be
                    marked on it. Then put the model in water, and load it until the ſurface of the
                    water is exactly at the light water line ; and let it be ſuſpended until the
                    water drains off, and then weighed. Now since the weights of ſimilar bodies are
                    in the triplicate ratio of their homologous dimenſions, the weight of the ſhip
                    when light is, therefore, equal to the product of the cube of the number of
                    times the ſhip exceeds the model by the weight of the model, which is to be
                    reduced to tons. Hence, if the model is conſtructed to a quarter of an inch
                    ſcale, and its weight expreſſed in ounces ; then to the constant logarithm
                    0.4893556, add the logarithm of the weight of the model in ounces, and the ſum
                    will be the logarithm of the weight of the ſhip in tons.</p>
                <p>Again, the model is to be loaded until the ſurface of the water coincides with
                    the load water line. Now the model being weighed, the weight of the ſhip is to
                    be found by the preceding rule : then the difference between the weights of the
                    ſhip when light and loaded is the tonnage required.<pb

                    Make AC equal to the depth of the keel, 2 feet 3 inches from ſcale n' 2, and
                    through C draw a line parallel to AB, which will repreſent the upper edge oſ the
                    keel ; upon which ſet off Cc equal to 21 tons 1855 lbs, taken from ſcale n⁰ 1.
                    Again, make AD equal to the diſtance between the lower edge of the keel and the
                    fifth water line, namely, 6 feet 4 inches, and a line drawn through D parallel
                    to AB will be the repreſentation of the lower water line ; and make D <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> equal to 305 tons 848 lbs, the correſponding tonnage.
                    In like manner draw the other water lines, and lay off the correſponding
                    tonnages accordingly : then through the points A, <hi rend="italic">c, b, e, ſ,

                    ſhip, or that when ſhe is brought down to the load water line. And ſince the
                    ſhip diſplaces 1788 tons at her light water mark, take therefore that quantity
                    from the ſcale n <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 1, which being laid upon AB from

                    required to find the number of cubic feet diſplaced when the draught of water is
                    17 feet, and the number of additional tons neceſſary to bring her down to the
                    load water mark.</p>
                <p>Take the given draught of water 17 feet from the ſcale n⁰ 2, which laid from it
                    will reach to I ; through which draw the line IMN parallel to AB, and
                    interſecting the curve in AC ; then the diſtance IM applied to the ſcale n⁰ 1.
                    will meaſure about 2248 tons, the diſplacement anſwerable to that draught of
                    water ; and MN applied to the ſame ſcale will meaſure about 1405 tons, the
                    additional weight neceſſary to bring her down to the load water mark. Alſo the
                    neareſt diſtance between M and the line KL will meaſure about 460 tons, the
                    weight already on board.</p>
                <p>It will conduce very much to facilitate this operation to divide KB into a ſcale
                    of tons taken from the scale n⁰ I, beginning at B, and alſo <hi rend="italic"
                        >h</hi> L, beginning at <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> Then when the draught of

                    example, and IMN drawn parallel to AB, and interſecting the curve in M. Now
                    through M draw a line perpendicular to AB, and it will meet KB in a point
                    repreſenting the number of tons aboard, and alſo <hi rend="italic">b</hi> L in a
                    point denoting the additional weight neceſſary to load her.</p>
                <p>Again, if the weight on board be given, the correſponding draught of water is
                    obtained as follows.</p>
                <p>Find the given number of tons in the ſcale KB, through which draw a line
                    perpendicular to AB ; then through the point of interſection of this line with
                    the curve draw another line parallel to AB. Now the diſtance between A and the
                    point where the parallel interſected AH being applied to the ſcale n⁰ 2, will
                    give the draught of water required.</p>
                <p>Any other caſe to which this ſcale may be applied will be obvious.</p>

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Since</hi> the pressure of fluids is equal in every
                    direction, the bottom of a ſhip is therefore acted upon by the fluid in which it
                    is immerſed ; which preſſure, for any given portion of ſurface, is equal to the
                    product of that portion by the depth and denſity of the fluid : or it is equal
                    to the weight of a column of the fluid whoſe baſe is the given ſurface, and the
                    altitude equal to the diſtance between the ſurface of the fluid and the centre
                    of gravity of the ſurface preſſed. Hence a floating body is in equilibrio
                    between two forces, namely, its gravity and the vertical preſſure of the fluid ;
                    the horizontal preſſure being deſtroyed.</p>
                <p>Let A,BC (fig. 49.) be any body immerſed in a fluid whoſe line of floatation is
                    GH : hence the preſſure of the fluid is exerted on every portion of the ſurface
                    of the immerſed part AFCH. Let EF, CD be any two ſmall portions contained
                    between the lines ED, FC, parallel to each other, and to the line of floatation
                    GH : then the preſſure exerted upon EF <hi rend="italic">is</hi> expreſſed by EF
                    × IK, IK being the depth of EF</p>
                <p>or CD ; the denſity of the fluid being ſuppoſed equal to 1. In like manner the
                    preſſure upon CD is equal to CD X IK. Now ſince the preſſure is in a direction
                    perpendicular to the ſurface, draw therefore the line EL perpendicular to EF,
                    and DM perpendicular to DC, and make each equal to the depth IK, below the
                    ſurface. Now the effort or preſſure of the fluid upon EF will be expreſſed by EF
                    × EL, and that upon CD by CD × DM. Complete the parallelograms ON, QS, and the
                    preſſure in the direction EL is reſolved into EN, EO, the firſt in a horizontal,
                    and the ſecond in a vertical direction. In like manner, the preſſure in the
                    direction DM is reſolved into the presſures, DS, DQ. Hence the joint effect of
                    the preſſures in the horizontal and vertical directions, namely, EF X EN, and EF
                    × EO, will be equal to EF × EL : For the ſame reaſon, CD x DP + CD x DQ= CD ×
                    DM. But the parts of the preſſures in a horizontal direction EF × EN, and CD ×
                    DP, are equal. For, becauſe of the ſimilar triangles ENL, ERF, and DPM, DSC,</p>
                <p>EL EF , DM DC we have = FR and DP <hi rend="superscript"> =</hi> CS : Hence DM
                    ×CS = DP × DC, and EL× FR = EN × EF. Now ſince EL = DM, and FR = CS, therefore
                    EL × FR = DM X CS = DP X DC = EN × EF. Hence, ſince EF × EN — DP × CD, the
                    effects of the preſſures in a horizontal direction are therefore equal and
                    contrary, and conſequently deſtroy each other.</p>
                <p>The preſſure in a vertical direction is repreſented by EO × EF, DQ X DC, &amp;c.
                    which, becauſe of the ſimilar triangles EOL, ERF, and DLM, DSC, become EL × ER,
                    DM X DS, &amp;c. or IK × ER, IK × DS, &amp;c. By applying the ſame reaſoning to
                    every other portion of the ſurface of the immerſed part of the body, it is hence
                    evident that the ſum of the vertical preſſures is equal to the ſum of the
                    correſponding diſplaced columns of the fluid.</p>
                <p>Hence a floating body is preſſed upwards by a force equal to the weight of the
                    quantity of water diſplaced; and ſince there is an equilibrium between this
                    force and the weight of the body, therefore the weight of a floating body is
                    equal to the weight of the diſplaced fluid<note anchored="true" n="19"

                    Hence alſo the centre of gravity of the body and the centre of gravity of the
                    diſplaced fluid are in the ſame vertical, otherwiſe the body would not be at
                    rest.</p>

                    the veſſel would run the rifle either of being broken in pieces, or of ſuffering
                    ſome alteration in its figure.</p>
                <p>The vessel is in a ſituation ſimilar to that of a rod AB (fig. 50.), which being
                    acted upon by the forces A <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> C c, D d, B <hi

                    has a ſufficient degree of ſtiffneſs : but as ſoon as it begins to give way, it
                    is evident it muſt bend in a convex manner, ſince its middle would obey the

                        >a</hi> and B <hi rend="italic">b.</hi></p>
                <p>The vessel is generally found in ſuch a ſituation ; and ſince similar efforts
                    continually act whilſt the veſſel is immerſed in the water, it happens but too
                    often that the keel experiences the bad effect of a ſtrain. It is therefore very
                    important to inquire into the true cauſe of this accident.</p>
                <p>For this purpoſe, let us conceive the vessel to be divided into two parts by a
                    tranſverſe ſection through the vertical axis of the veſſel, in which both the
                    centre of gravity G (fig. 51.) of the whole veſſel and that of the immerſed part
                    are ſituated : ſo that one of them wall repreſent the head part, and the other
                    that of the ſtern, each of which will be considered ſeparately. Let <hi
                        rend="italic">g</hi> be the centre of gravity of the entire weight of the
                    firſt, and <hi rend="italic">o</hi> that of the immerſed part correſponding. In
                    like manner, let <hi rend="italic">y</hi> be the centre of gravity of tire whole
                    after part, and w that of its immediate portion.</p>
                <p>Now it is plain, that the head will be acted upon by the two forces g <hi
                        rend="italic">m</hi> and o n <hi rend="italic">,</hi> of which the firſt
                    will preſs it down, and the latter puſh it up. In the ſame manner, the ſtern
                    will be preſſed down by the force γμ, and puſhed up by the force ων. But theſe
                    four forces will maintain themſelves in equilibrium, as well as the total forces
                    reunited in the points G and O, which are equivalent to them ; but whilſt
                    neither the forces before nor thoſe behind fall in the ſame direction, the
                    veſſel will evidently ſuſtain efforts tending to bend the keel upwards, if the
                    two points ο <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> are nearer the middle than the two other
                    forces <hi rend="italic">g m</hi> and γμ contrary effect would happen if the
                    points ο and ω were more diſtant from the middle than the points <hi
                        rend="italic">g</hi> and <hi rend="italic">γ.</hi></p>
                <p>But the firſt of theſe two cauſes uſually takes place almoſt in all veſſels,
                    ſince they have a greater breadth towards the middle, and become more and more
                    narrow towards the extremities ; whilſt the weight of the veſſel is in
                    proportion much more conſiderable towards the extremities than at the middle.
                    From whence we see, that the greater this difference becomes, the more alſo will
                    the veſſel be ſubject to the forces which tend to bend its keel upwards. It is
                    therefore from thence that we muſt judge how much ſtrength it is neceſſary to
                    give to this part of the veſſel, in order to avoid ſuch a conſequence.</p>
                <p>If other circumſtances would permit either to load the veſſel more in the middle,
                    or to give to the part immerſed a greater capacity towards the head and ſtern,
                    ſuch an effect would no longer be apprehended. But the deſtination of moſt
                    veſſels is entirely oppoſite to ſuch an arrangement : by which means we are
                    obliged, to ſtrengthen the keel as much as may be neceſſary, in order to avoid
                    ſuch a diſaſter.</p>
                <p>We ſhall conclude this chapter with the following practical obſervations on the
                    hogging and fagging of ſhips by Mr Hutchinſon of Liverpool :.</p>
                <p>“ When ſhips with long floors happen to be laid a- dry upon mud or fand, which
                    makes a ſolid reſiſtance againſt the long ſtraight floors amidſhips, in
                    companion with the two ſharp ends, the entrance and run meet with little
                    ſupport, but are preſſed down, lower than the flat of the floor, and in
                    proportion hogs the ſhip amidſhips ; which is too well known from experience to
                    occaſion many total loſſes, or do ſo much damage by hogging them, as to require
                    a vaſt deal of trouble and expence to save and repair them, ſo as to get the hog
                    taken out and brought to their proper ſheer again : and to do this the more
                    effectually, the owners have often been induced to go to the expence of
                    lengthening them; and by the common method, in proportion as they add to the
                    burden of theſe ſhips, by lengthening their too long ſtraight floors in their
                    main bodies amidſhips, ſo much do they add to their general weakneſs to bear
                    hardſhips either on the ground or afloat ; for the ſcantling of their old timber
                    and plank is not proportionable to bear the additional burden that is added to
                    them.</p>
                <p>“ But defects of this kind are beſt proved from real and inconteſtable tacts in
                    common practice. At the very time I was writing upon this ſubject, I was called
                    upon for my advice by the commander of one of those ſtrong, long, ſtraight
                    floored ſhips, who was in much trouble and distraction of mind for the damage
                    his ſhip had taken by the pilot laying her on a hard, gentle ſloping sand, at
                    the outſide of our docks at Liverpool, where it is common for ſhips that will
                    take the ground to lie for a tide, when it proves too late to get into our wet
                    docks. After recommending a proper ſhip carpenter, I went to the ſhip, which lay
                    with only a ſmall keel, yet was greatly hogged, and the butts of her upper works
                    ſtrained greatly on the lee- side ; and the learns of her bottom, at the lower
                    futtock heads, vaſtly opened on the weather side : all which ſtrained parts were
                    agreed upon not to be caulked, but filled with tallow, putty, or clay, &amp;c.
                    with raw bullocks hides, or canvas nailed with battons on her bottom, which
                    prevented her sinking with the flow of the tide, without hindering the preſſure
                    of water from righting and doling the ſeams again as ſhe floated, ſo asto enable
                    them to keep her free with pumping. This veſſel, like many other inſtances of
                    ſhips of this conduction that I have known, was ſaved and repaired at a very
                    great expence in our dry repairing docks. And that them bottoms not only hog
                    upwards, but ſag (or curve) downwards, to dangerous and fatal degrees, according
                    to the ſtrain or preſſure that prevails upon them, will be proved from the
                    following tacts :</p>
                <p>“ It has been long known from experience, that when ſhips load deep with very
                    heavy cargoes or materials that are flowed too low, it makes them ſo very
                    labourſome at ſea, when the waves run high, as to roll away their masts ; and
                    after that misfortune cauſes them to labour and roll the more, ſo as to endanger
                    their working and ſtraining themſelves to pieces : to prevent which, it has been
                    long a common practice to leave a great part of their fore and after holds
                    empty, and to ſtow them as high as poſſible in the main body at mid- ſhips,
                    which cauſes the bottoms of theſe long ſtraight floored ſhips to ſag downwards;
                    in proportion as the weight of the cargo flowed there exceeds the preſſure of
                    the water upwards, ſo much ſo as to make them, dangerouſly and fatally
                    leaky.</p>
                <p>“ I have known many inſtances of thoſe ſtrong ſhips of 500 or 600 tons burdens
                    built with long ſtraight floors, on the eaſt coast of England, for the coal and
                    timber trade, come loaded with timber from the Baltic<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0427.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0421"/> to Liverpool,
                    where they commonly load deep with rock ſalt, which is too heavy to fill their
                    holds, ſo that for the above reaſons they flowed it high amidſhips, and left
                    large empty ſpaces in their fore and after holds, which cauſed their long
                    ſtraight floors to lag downwards, ſo much as to make their hold ſtaunchions
                    amidſhips, at the main hatchway, ſettle from the beams three or four inches, and
                    their mainmaſts ſettle ſo much as to oblige them to ſet up the main rigging when
                    rolling hard at ſea, to prevent the mails being rolled away ; and they were
                    rendered ſo leaky as to be obliged to return to Liverpool to get their leaks
                    flopped at great expence. And in order to ſave the time and expence in
                    discharging them, endeavours were made to find out and stop their leaks, by
                    laying them aſhore dry on a level land ; but without effect : for though their
                    bottoms were thus ſagged down by their cargoes when afloat, yet when they came
                    a-dry upon the sand, ſome of their bottoms hogged upwards so much as to raiſe
                    their mainmaſts and pumps ſo high as to tear their coats from their decks ; ſo
                    that they have been obliged to diſcharge their cargoes, and give them a repair
                    in the repairing dock, and in ſome to double their bottoms, to enable them to
                    carry their cargoes with ſafety, ſtowed in this manner. From this cauſe I have
                    known one of theſe ſtrong ſhips to founder.</p>
                <p>“ Among the many inſtances of ſhips that have been diſtressed by carrying cargoes
                    of lead, one ſailed from hence bound to Marſeilles, which was ſoon obliged to
                    put back again in great diſtreſs, having had four feet water in the hold, by the
                    commander’s account, owing to the ſhip’s bottom fagging down to ſuch a degree as
                    made the hold ſtaunchions ſettle six inches from the lower deck beams amidſhips
                    ; yet it is common with theſe long ſtraight floored ſhips, when theſe heavy
                    cargoes are discharged that makes their bottom ſag down, then to hog upwards: ſo
                    that when they are put into a dry repairing dock, with empty holds, upon
                    ſtraight blocks, they commonly either ſplit the blocks cloſe fore and aft, or
                    damage their keels there, by the whole weight of the ſhip lying upon them, when
                    none lies upon the blocks under the flat of their floors amidſhips, that being
                    hogged upwards ; which was the caſe of this ſhip’s bottom ; though ſagged
                    downwards six inches by her cargo, it was now found hogged ſo much that her keel
                    did not touch the blocks amidſhips, which occaſioned ſo much damage to the after
                    part of the keel, as to oblige them to repair it ; which is commonly the caſe
                    with theſe ſhips, and therefore deſerving particular notice.”</p>
                <p>In order to prevent these defects in ſhips, “ they ſhould all be built with their
                    floors or bottoms length- wiſe, to form an arch with the projecting part
                    downwards, which will naturally not only contribute greatly to prevent their
                    taking damage by their bottoms hogging and ſtraining upwards, either aground or
                    afloat, as has been mentioned, but will, among other advantages, be a help to
                    their ſailing, fleering, flaying, and waring.”</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Chap.</hi> III. <hi rend="italic">Of the Stability oſ

                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">When</hi> a veſſel receives an impulſe or preſſure in a
                    horizontal direction, ſo as to be inclined in a ſmall degree, the veſſel will
                    then, either regain its former position as the preſſure is taken off, and is in
                    this caſe</p>
                <p>ſaid to be poſſeſſed of ſtability ; or it will continue in its inclined ſtate ;
                    or, laſtly, the inclination will increaſe until the veſſel is overturned. With
                    regard to the firſt caſe, it is evident that a ſufficient degree of ſtability is
                    neceſſary in order to ſuſtain the efforts of the wind ; but neither of the
                    other, two cases muſt be permitted to have place in veſſels.</p>
                <p>Let CED (fig. 52.) be the ſection of a ſhip paſſing through its centre of
                    gravity, and perpendicular to the ſheer and floor plans ; which let be in
                    equilibrium in a fluid ; AB being the water line, G the centre of gravity of the
                    whole body, and <hi rend="italic">g</hi> that of the immerſed part AEB. Let the
                    body receive now a very ſmall inclination, ſo that <hi rend="italic">a</hi> E
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> becomes the immerſed part, and γ its centre of
                    gravity. From γ draw γ M perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">a b,</hi> and
                    meeting <hi rend="italic">g</hi> G, produced, if neceſſary, in M. If, then, the
                    point M thus found is higher than G the centre of gravity of the whole body, the
                    body will, in this caſe, return to its former poſition, the preſſure being taken
                    off. If the point M coincides with G, the veſſel will remain in its inclined
                    ſtate ; but if M be below G, the inclination of the veſſel will continually
                    increaſe until it is entirely overſet.</p>
                <p>The point of interſection M is called the <hi rend="italic">metacenter,</hi> and
                    is the limit of the altitude of the centre of gravity of the whole veſſel.
                    Whence it is evident, from what has already been said; that the ſtability of the
                    veſſel increaſes with the altitude of the metacenter above the centre of gravity
                    : But when the metacenter coincides with the centre of gravity, the veſſel has
                    no tendency whatever to move out of the ſituation into which it may be put.
                    Thus, if the veſſel be inclined either to the right or left side, it will remain
                    in that poſition until a new force is impreſſed upon it : in this caſe,
                    therefore, the veſſel would not be able to carry sail, and is hence unfit for
                    the purpoſes of navigation. If the metacenter is below the common centre of
                    gravity, the veſſel will inſtantly overſet.</p>
                <p>As the determination of the metacenter is of the utmoſt importance in the
                    conſtruction of ſhips, it is therefore thought neceſſary to illuſtrate this
                    ſubject more particularly.</p>
                <p>Let AEB (fig. 52.) be a ſection of a ſhip perpendicular to the keel, and alſo to
                    the plane of elevation, and paſſing through the centre of gravity of the ſhip,
                    and alſo through the centre oſ gravity of the immerſed part, which let be <hi
                        rend="italic">g.</hi></p>
                <p>Now let the ſhip be ſuppoſed to receive a very ſmall inclination, ſo that the
                    line of floatation is <hi rend="italic">a, b,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">γ</hi>
                    the centre of gravity of the immerſed part <hi rend="italic">a</hi> E <hi
                        rend="italic">b.</hi> From γ draw γ M perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">a
                        b,</hi> and intersecting GM in M, the metacenter, as before. Hence the
                    preſſure of the water will be in the direction <hi rend="italic">7</hi> M.</p>
                <p>In order to determine the point M, the metacenter, the poſition of <hi
                        rend="italic">7</hi> with reſpect to the lines AB and g G, muſt be
                    previouſly aſcertained. For this purpoſe, let the ſhip be ſuppoſed to be divided
                    into a great number of sections by planes perpendicular to the keel, and
                    parallel to each other, and to that formerly drawn, theſe planes being ſuppoſed
                    equidiſtant. Let AEB (fig. 53.) be one of theſe lections, <hi rend="italic"
                        >g</hi> the centre of gravity of the immerſed part before inclination, and
                        <hi rend="italic">γ</hi> the centre of gravity of the immerſed part when the
                    ſhip is in its inclined ſtate ; the diſtance g γ between the two centres<pb

                    each ſection is to be found. Let AB be the line of floatation of the ſhip when
                    in an upright ſtate, and <hi rend="italic">a b</hi> the water line when
                    inclined. Then, becauſe the weight of the ſhip remains the ſame, the quantity of
                    water displaced will alſo be the ſame in both caſes, and therefore AEB — aEb,
                    each ſuſtaining the ſame part of the whole weight of the ſhip. From each of
                    theſe take the part AE h, which is common to both, and the remainders AO b, BO
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> will be equal ; and which, becauſe the inclination
                    is ſuppoſed very small, may be conſidered as rectilineal triangles, and the
                    point O the middle of AB.</p>
                <p>Now, let H, I, K, be the centres of gravity of the ſpaces A <hi rend="smallcaps"

                    to AB, and let IL be drawn perpendicular to EO. Now to aſcertain the diſtance γ

                        >a</hi> × H <hi rend="italic">h.</hi> But ſince <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is
                    the common centre of gravity of the two parts AEb, BO <hi rend="italic">b,</hi>
                    we have therefore AEB × gO = AEi×I ;+BO <hi rend="italic">b× Kk.</hi> Hence by
                    expunging the term AE <hi rend="italic">b</hi> × I <hi rend="italic">i</hi> from
                    each of theſe equations, and comparing them, we obtain AEB X γ q = AEB× g O — BO
                        <hi rend="italic">b</hi> X K <hi rend="italic">k —</hi> AO <hi rend="italic"
                        >a ×</hi> H h.</p>
                <p>Now, ſince the triangles AO <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> BO <hi rend="italic"
                        >b,</hi> are ſuppoſed infinitely ſmall, their momentums or products, by the
                    infinitely little lines H <hi rend="italic">h,</hi> K <hi rend="italic">k,</hi>
                    will alſo be infinitely ſmall with reſpect to AEB X <hi rend="italic">g</hi> O;
                    which therefore being rejected, the former equation becomes AEB × γ <hi
                        rend="italic">q</hi> = AEBx g O, and hence γq = gO. Whence the centres of
                    gravity γ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> g, being at equal diſtances below AB, the
                    infinitely little line <hi rend="italic">y g</hi> is therefore perpendicular to
                    EO. For the ſame reaſon g γ, fig. 52. may be conſidered as an arch of a circle
                    whole centre is M.</p>
                <p>To determine the value of <hi rend="italic">g y,</hi> the momentum of <hi
                        rend="italic">a</hi> E <hi rend="italic">b</hi> with reſpect to EO muſt be
                    taken, for the ſame reaſon as before, and put equal to the momentums of the two
                    parts AO <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> AE <hi rend="italic">b</hi>; and we ſhall
                    then have <hi rend="italic">a</hi> E <hi rend="italic">b × gγ,</hi> or AEB X <hi
                        rend="italic">g γ</hi> = AEB X IL + AO <hi rend="italic">a</hi> χ O A But
                    ſince <hi rend="italic">g</hi> is the oommon centre of gravity of the two ſpaces
                    AE <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> BO <hi rend="italic">b,</hi> we ſhall have AE <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> X IL — BOb X <hi rend="italic">Ok =</hi> O, or AEb X IL
                    = BO b × Ok. Hence AEB × g <hi rend="italic">γ</hi> = BOb × Ok +AOa × Oh</p>
                <p>— 2 BOb X Ok ; becauſe the two triangles AO <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> BO <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> are equal, and that the diſtances O <hi rend="italic"
                        >k,</hi> O h, are alſo evidently equal.</p>
                <p>Let x be the thickneſs of the ſection repreſented by ABC. Then the momentum of
                    this ſection will be 2 BO <hi rend="italic">b</hi> X x X O <hi rend="italic"
                        >k,</hi> which equation will alſo ſerve for each particular ſection.</p>
                <p>Now let s' repreſent the ſum of the momentums of all the ſectior.s. Hence <hi
                        rend="italic">ſ,</hi> AEB × x X <hi rend="italic">g γ = s,</hi> 2. BO <hi
                        rend="italic">b</hi> X x X O <hi rend="italic">k.</hi> Now the firſt member
                    being the ſum of the momentums of each ſection, in proportion to a plane paſſing
                    through the keel, ought therefore to be equal to the ſum of all the ſections, or
                    to the volume of the immerſed part of the bottom multiplied by the diſtance <hi
                        rend="italic">g y.</hi> Hence V repreſenting the volume, we ſhall have V X
                        <hi rend="italic">g γ = ſ, 2</hi> BO <hi rend="italic">b</hi> X <hi
                        rend="italic">x</hi> O <hi rend="italic">k.</hi></p>
                <p>In order to determine the value of the ſecond member of this equation, it may be
                    remarked, that when the ſhip is inclined, the original plane of floatation CBPQ,
                    (fig. 54.) becomes C <hi rend="italic">b ρ</hi> Q. Now the triangles NIn, BO <hi
                        rend="italic">b,</hi> being the ſame as thoſe in figures 52∙ and 53 ; and as
                    each of theſe triangles have one angle equal, they may, upon account of their
                    infinite ſmallneſs, be conſidered as ſimilar ; and hence BOb:NI <hi
                        rend="italic">n</hi>: : OB</p>
                <p>QB</p>
                <p>: IN ; whence BO b =, X N In. Moreover, we</p>

                    the ſection at the waterline muſt be divided by lines perpendicular to the
                    middle line of this ſection into a great number of equal parts, ſo that the
                    portion of the curve contained between any two adjacent perpendiculars may be
                    conſidered as a ſtraight line. Then the ſum of the cubes of the half
                    perpendiculars or ordinates is to be multiplied by the diſtance between the
                    perpendiculars, and two thirds of the product is to be divided by the volume of

                <p>It is hence evident, that while the ſector at the water line is the ſame, and the

                <p>ln order to determine the centre of gravity of the immerſed part of a (hip’s
                    bottom, we muſt begin with determining the centre of gravity of a ſection of the
                    ſhip parallel to the keel, as ANDFPB (fig. 56.), bounded by the parallel lines
                    AB, DF, and by the equal and ſimilar curves AND, BPF.</p>
                <p>If the equation of this curve were known, its centre of gravity would be eaſily
                    found : but as this is not the case, let therefore the line CE be drawn through
                    the middle C, E, of the lines AB, DF, and let this line CE be divided into ſo
                    great a number of equal parts by the perpendiculars TH, KM, &amp;c. that the
                    arches of the curves contained between the extremities of any two adjacent
                    perpendiculars may be conſidered as ſtraight lines. The momentums of the
                    trapeziums DTHF, TKMH, &amp;c. relative to the point E, are then to be found,
                    and the ſum of theſe momentums is to be divided by the ſum of the trapeziums,
                    that is, by the ſurface ANDFPB.</p>
                <p>The diſtance of the centre of gravity of the trapezium THFD from the point E is =

                    gravity of the trapezium TKMH from the ſame point E will be <hi

                <p>Now, if each diſtance be multiplied by the ſurface of the correſponding

                    the trapezium into the common altitude IE, we ſhall have the momentums of theſe

                    IE <hi rend="superscript"> 2</hi> × (DF+6TH+12 KM + 18 NP+24QS+14 AB). Whence it
                    may be remarked, that if the line CE be divided into a great number of equal
                    parts, the factor or coefficient of the laſt term, which is here 14, will be = 2

                <p>The area of the figure ANDFPB is equal to IE × (4 DF + TH + KM + N P +, &amp;c...
                    .+ 4AB) ; hence the diſtance EG of the centre of gravity G from one of the
                    extreme ordinates DF is equal to IE × (<hi rend="superscript"> 1</hi> / <hi

                <p>Whence the following rule to find the diſtance of the centre of gravity G from
                    one of the extreme ordinates DF. To the ſixth of the firſt ordinate add the
                    sixth of the laſt ordinate multiplied by three times the number of ordinates
                    minus four ; then the ſecond ordinate, twice the third, three times the fourth,
                    &amp;c. the ſum will be a firſt term. Then to half the ſum oſ the extreme
                    ordinates add all the intermediate ones, and the ſum will be a second term. Now
                    the firſt term divided by the second, and the quotient multiplied by the
                    interval between two adjacent perpendiculars, will be the diſtance ſought.</p>
                <p>Thus, let there be seven perpendiculars, whoſe values are 18, 23, 28, 30, 30, 21,
                    0, feet respectively, and the common interval between theſe perpendiculars. 20
                    feet. Now the ſixth of the firſt term 18 is 3 ; and as the laſt term is 0,
                    therefore to 3 add 23, twice 28 or 56, thrice 30 or 90, four times 30 or 120,
                    five times 21 or <hi rend="italic">105</hi>; and the ſum is 397. Then to the
                    half of 18 + 0, or 9, add the intermediate ordinates, and the ſum will be 141.
                    Now 397 x 20, or 7940, = 59 feet</p>
                <p><hi rend="subscript"> 141 or</hi> 141</p>
                <p>4 inches nearly, the diſtance of the centre of gravity from the firſt
                    ordinate.</p>
                <p>Now, when the centre of gravity of any ſection is. determined, it is easy from
                    thence to find the centre of gravity of the ſolid, and conſequently that of the
                    bottom of a ſhip.</p>
                <p>The next ſtep is to find the height of the centre of gravity of the bottom above
                    the keel. For this purpoſe the bottom muſt be imagined to be divided into
                    ſections by planes parallel to the keel or water-line, (figs. 37, 58.) Then the
                    solidity of each portion contained between two parallel planes will be equal to
                    half the ſum of the two oppoſed ſurfaces multiplied by the diſtance between them
                    ; and its centre of gravity will be at the ſame altitude as that of the
                    trapezium <hi rend="italic">abcd,</hi> (fig. 58.), which is in the vertical
                    ſection paſſing through the keel. It is hence obvious, that the ſame rule as
                    before is to be applied to find the altitude of the centre of gravity, with this
                    difference only, that the word perpendicular or ordinate is to be changed into
                    ſection. Hence the rule is, to the ſixth part of the loweſt ſection add the
                    product of the ſixth part of the uppermoſt ſection by three times the number of
                    ſections minus four ; the second ſection in aſcending twice the third, three
                    times the fourth, &amp;c. the ſum will be a firſt term. To half the ſum of upper
                    and lower ſections add the intermediate ones, the ſum will be a second term.
                    Divide the firſt term by the second, and the quotient multiplied by the diſtance
                    between the ſections will give the altitude of the centre of gravity above the
                    keel.</p>
                <p>With regard to the centre of gravity of a ſhip, whether it is conſidered as
                    loaded or light, the operation becomes more difficult. The momentum of every
                    different part of the ſhip and cargo muſt be found ſeparately with reſpect to a
                    horizontal and alſo a vertical: plane. Now the ſums of theſe two momentums being
                    divided by the weight of the ſhip, will give the altitude of the centre of
                    gravity, and its diſtance from the vertical plane ; and as this centre is in a
                    vertical plane paſſing through the axis of the keel, its place is therefore
                    determined. In the calculation of the momentums, it muſt be obſerved to multiply
                    the weight, and not the magnitude of each piece, by the diſtance of its centre
                    of gravity.</p>
                <p>A more eaſy method of finding the centre of gravity of a ſhip is by a mechanical
                    operation, as follows; Conſtruct<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0430.tif"

                    ſimilar to the parts of the propoſed draught or ſhip, by a ſcale of about
                    one-fourth of an inch to a foot. The block is then to be ſuſpended by a
                    ſilk-thread or very fine line, placed in different ſituations until it is found
                    to be in a ſtate of equilibrium, and the centre of gravity will be pointed out.
                    The block may be proved by fattening the line which ſuſpends it to any point in
                    the line joining the middles of the ſtem and poſt, and weights are to be
                    ſuſpended from the extremities of this middle line at the ſtem and poſt. If,
                    then, the block be properly conſtructed, a plane paſſing through the line of
                    ſuſpenſion, and the other two lines, will alſo paſs through the keel, ſtem, and
                    poſt. Now, the block being ſuſpended in this manner from any point in the middle
                    line, a line is to be drawn on the block parallel to the line of ſuſpenſion, ſo
                    that the plane paſſing through theſe two lines may be perpendicular to the
                    vertical plane of the ſhip in the direction of the keel. The line by which the
                    block is suspended is then to be removed to ſome</p>
                <p>other convenient point in the middle line ; and another line is to be drawn on
                    the block parallel to the line ſuſpending it, as before. Then the point of
                    intersection of this line with the former will give the position of the centre
                    of gravity on the block, which may now be laid down in the draught.</p>

                    alſo its altitude, may from thence be eaſily determined.</p>
                <p>From the principles already explained, the diſtance of the centre of gravity of
                    the bottom from the aft ſide of the poſt, is equal to the ſum of the momentums
                    of an infinite number of horizontal planes, divided by the ſum of theſe planes,
                    or, which is the ſame, by the ſolidity of the bottom. As, however, we have no
                    more than eight planes, we muſt therefore conceive their momentums as the
                    ordinates of a curve, whoſe diſtances may be the ſame as that of the horizontal

                <p>The height of the centre of gravity of the bottom above the lower edge of the

                    and to half the ſum of the extreme planes add all the intermediate ones. Now the

                <p>Sails are made of canvas, of different textures, and are extended on or between
                    the maſts, to receive the wind that forces the veſſel through the water. They
                    are quadrilateral or triangular, as has been elſewhere deſcribed, and are cut
                    out of the canvas cloth by cloth. The width is governed by the length of the
                    yard, gaff, boom, or ſtay ; the depth by the height of the mast. In the valuable
                    work to which we have juſt referred, the following directions are given for
                    cutting ſails. " The width and depth being given, find the number of cloths the
                    width requires, allowing for ſeams, tabling on the leeches, and ſlack cloth ;
                    and, in the depth, allow for tabling on the head and foot. For ſails cut ſquare
                    on the head and foot, with gores only on the leeches, as ſome topſails, &amp;c.
                    the cloths on the head, between the leeches, are cut ſquare to the depth ; and
                    the gores on the leeches are found by dividing the depth of the ſail by the
                    number of cloths gored, which gives the length of each gore. The gore is ſet
                    down from a ſquare with the oppoſite ſelvage; and the canvas being cut
                    diagonally, the longeſt gored ſide of one cloth makes the ſhorteſt ſide of the
                    next ; conſequently, the firſt gore being known, the rest are cut by it. In the
                    leeches of topſails cut hollow, the upper gores are longer than the lower ones ;
                    and in ſails cut with a roach leech, the lower gores are longer than the upper
                    ones. This muſt be regulated by judgment, and care taken that the whole of the
                    gores do not exceed the depth of the leech. Or, by drawing on paper the gored
                    side of the ſail, and delineating the breadth of every cloth by a convenient
                    ſcale of equal parts of an inch to a foot, the length of every gore may be found
                    with preciſion. Sails, gored with a ſweep on the head or the foot, or on both,
                    have the depth of their gores marked on the ſelvage, from the ſquare of the
                    given depth on each cloth, and are cut as above ; the longeſt ſelvage of one
                    ſerving to meaſure the ſhorteſt ſelvage of the next, beginning with the firſt
                    gored cloth next the middle in ſome ſails, and the firſt cloth next the maſt
                    leech in others. For thoſe gores that are irregular no ſtrict rule can be given;
                    they can only be determined by the judgement of the ſail-maker, or by a
                    drawing.</p>
                <p>“ In the royal navy, mizen topſails are cut with three quarters of a yard hollow
                    in the foot ; but, in the merchant ſervice, top and topgallant ſails are cut
                    with more or leſs hollow in the foot. Flying jibs are cut with a roach-curve on
                    the ſtay, and a three-inch gore in each cloth, ſhortening from the tack to the
                    clue. Lower ſtudding-ſails are cut with ſquare leeches, and topmaſt and
                    topgallant-maſt ſtudding ſails with goring leeches.</p>
                <p>“ The length of reef and middle bands is governed by the width of the ſail at
                    their reſpective places; the leech- linings, buntline-cloths, top-linings,
                    maſt-cloths, and corner-pieces, are cut agreeably to the depth of the ſail ;
                    each cloth and every article ſhould be properly marked with charcoal, to prevent
                    confuſion or miſtake. Sails that have bonnets are cut out the whole depth of the
                    ſail and bonnet included, allowing enough for the tablings on the foot of the
                    ſail and head and foot of the bonnet, The bonnet is cut off after the ſail is
                    ſewed together. If a drabler is required, it is allowed for in the cutting out
                    the ſame as the bonnet.”</p>
                <p>When the cloth is thus properly cut, the different pieces are to be joined
                    together in the form of a ſail ; and for doing this properly we have the
                    following directions in the work already quoted, " Sails have a double flat
                    ſeam, and ſhould be ſewed with the beſt Engliſh-made twine of three threads,
                    ſpun 360 fathoms to the pound, and have from one hundred and eight to one
                    hundred and ſixteen ſtitches in every yard in length. The twine for large ſails,
                    in the royal navy, is waxed by hand, with genuine bees-wax, mixed with one-ſixth
                    part of clear turpentine ; and, for ſmall ſails, in a mixture made with bees
                    wax, 4 lb ; hogs lard 5 lb ; and clear turpentine 1 lb. In the merchant ſervice,
                    the twine is dipped in tar<note anchored="true" n="22" place="bottom"

                <p>“ It is the erroneous practice of ſome ſailmakers not to ſew the ſeams any
                    farther than where the edge is creaſed down for the tabling ; but all ſails
                    ſhould be ſewed quite home to the end, and, when finiſhed, ſhould be well rubbed
                    down with a rubber. In the merchant ſervice ſeams are ſometimes made broader at
                    the foot than at the head, being ſtroriger. Broad ſeams are not allowed to be
                    made on courſes, in the royal navy, but goring leeches are adopted in lieu of
                    them. Boom-mainiails and the ſails of ſloops generally have the ſeams broader at
                    the foot than at the head. The ſeams of courſes and topſails are ſtuck or
                    ſtitched up, in the middle of the ſeams, along the whole length, with doable
                    ſeaming-twine ; and have from 68 to 72 ſtitches in a yard. In the merchant
                    ſervice it is common to ſtick the ſeams with two rows of ſtitches, when the ſail
                    is half worn, as they will then laſt till the ſail is worn out.</p>
                <p>“ The breadth of the ſeams of courſes, topſails, and other ſails, in the royal
                    navy, to be as follow, viz. courſes and topſails, for 50 gun ſhips and upwards,
                    one inch and a half, and, for 44 gun ſhips and under, one inch and a quarter, at
                    head and foot ; all other ſails, one inch at head and foot.</p>
                <p>“ The tablings of all ſails are to be of a proportion- able breadth to the ſize
                    of the ſail, and ſewed at the edge, with 68 to 72 ſtitches in a yard. Thoſe for
                    the heads of main and fore courſes to be four to fix inches wide ; for ſprit
                    courſes and mizens, drivers, and other boom ſails, 3 to 4 inches wide ; for
                    topſails, 3 inches to 4 inches and a half ; topgallant and ſprit topſails, 3
                    inches ; royal ſails, 2 inches and a half; jib and other ſtayſails, 3 inches to
                    4 inches and a half, on the ſtay or hoiſt ; and for ſtudding ſails, 3 inches to
                    4 inches on the head. Tablings on the foot and leeches of main and fore courſes
                    to be 3 inches to 5 inches broad ; ſprit courſe and topſails, 3 inches ;
                    topgallant and ſprit topſails, 2 inches and a half ; royals, 2 inches ; fore
                    leeches of mizen, driver, and other boomſails, 3 inches and a half to 4 inches ;
                    after leech, 3 inches ; and on the foot 2 or 3 inches. Tablings on the after
                    leech of jibs and other ſtayſails to be from 2 to 3 inches broad ; and, on the
                    foot, 2 to a inches and a half : on ſtudding ſail leeches one inch and a half to
                    two inches and a half; and on the foot, from one to two inches.<pb

                    courſes are lined on the leeches, from clue to earing, with one cloth ſeamed on
                    and ſtuck or ſtitched in the middle, and have a middle band half way between the
                    lower reef band and the foot, alſo four buntline cloths, at equal diſtances
                    between the leeches, the upper end of which are carried under the middle band,
                    that the lower side of the band may be tabled upon or ſewed over the end of the
                    buntline pieces. They have likewiſe two reef bands ; each in breadth one third
                    of the breadth of the canvas ; the upper one is one ſixth of the depth of the
                    ſail from the head, and the lower band is at the ſame diſtance from the upper
                    one ; the ends go four inches under the leech linings, which are ſeamed over the
                    reef bands. All linings are ſeamed on, and are ſtuck with 68 to 72 ſtitches in a
                    yard.</p>
                <p>“ Main, fore, and mizen, topſails have leech linings, mast and top linings,
                    buntline cloths, middle bands and reef bands. The leech linings are made of one
                    breadth of cloth, ſo cut and ſewed as to be half a cloth broad at the head, and
                    a cloth and a half broad at the foot ; the piece cut out being half the breadth
                    of the cloth at one end, and tapering to a point at the other. The middle bands
                    are put on half way between the lower reef and foot, the buntline cloths join
                    the top-linings, and the buntline cloths and top-linings are carried up to the
                    lower side of the middle band, which is tabled on them. The maſt lining is of
                    two cloths, and extends from the foot of the ſail to the lower reef, to receive
                    the beat or chafe of the maſt. The middle band is made of one breadth of canvas,
                    of the fame number as the top-lining. It is firſt folded and rubbed down, to
                    make a creaſe at one third of the breadth ; then tabled on the ſelvage, and
                    ſtuck along the creaſe ; then turned down, and tabled and ſtuck through both the
                    double and ſingle parts, with 68 to 7 2 ſtitches in a yard. It is the opinion of
                    many, that middle bands ſhould not be put on until the ſail is half worn.</p>
                <p>“ Main and fore topsails have three and ſometimes four reef bands from leech to
                    leech, over the leech linings ; the upper one is one eighth of the depth of the
                    ſail from the head, and they are the ſame diſtance aſunder in the royal navy,
                    but more in the merchant ſervice. The reef bands are each of half a breadth of
                    canvas put on double ; the firſt ſide is ſtuck twice, and the laſt turned over,
                    ſo that the reef holes may be worked upon the double part of the band, which is
                    alſo ſtuck with 68 to 72 ſtitches in a yard.</p>
                <p>“ The top-lining of topſails is of canvas n <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> 6 or
                    7. The other linings of this, and all the linings of other ſails, ſhould be of
                    the ſame quality as the sails to which they belong.</p>
                <p>“ Top-linings and maſt cloths are put on the aft ſide, and all ocher linings on
                    the fore ſide, of ſails. Mizens are lined with one breadth of cloth from the
                    clue five yards up the leech, and have a reef band ſewed on, in the ſame manner
                    as on other ſails, at one fifth the depth of the ſail from the foot ; they have
                    alſo a nock-piece and a peek-piece, one cut out of the other, ſo that each
                    contains one yard. Mizen topſails of 50 gun ſhips and upwards have three reefs,
                    the upper one is one eighth of the depth of the ſail from the head, and the
                    reefs are at the ſame diſtance aſunder. Mizen topſails of ſhips of 44 guns and
                    under have two reefs one ſeventh part of the depth of the ſail aſunder, the
                    upper one being at the ſame diſtance from the head. Main and main top ſtudding ſails have each one reef, at one eighth of the depth of the ſail ſrom
                    the head. Reef bands ſhould not be put on until the ſail is ſewed up, a contrary
                    practice being very erroneous. Lower ſtayſails, fore top and main top ſtayſails,
                    and flying jibs, have clue-pieces two yards long. Square tack ſtayſails have
                    half a breadth of cloth at the fore part, with a clue-piece containing two
                    yards, and a peek-piece, containing one yard.</p>
                <p>“ Sails have two holes in each cloth, at the heads and reefs of courſes,
                    topſails, and other ſquare ſails ; one hole in every yard in the ſtay of flying
                    jibs, and one in every three quarters of a yard in the ſtays of ſquare tack and
                    other ſtayſails. Theſe are made by an inſtrument called a <hi rend="italic"
                        >pegging awl, or</hi> a ſtabber, and are fenced round by ſtitching the edge
                    to a ſmall grommet, made with log or other line ; when finiſhed, they ſhould be
                    well ſtretched or rounded up by a pricker or a marline-ſpike. Reef and head
                    holes of large ſails have grommets of twelve-thread line, worked round with 18
                    to 21 ſtitches ; ſmaller ſails have grommets of nine-thread line, with 16 to 18
                    ſtitches, or as many as ſhall cover the line, and ſmaller holes in proportion.
                    The holes for marling the clues of ſails and the top-brims of topſails have
                    grommets of log-line, and ſhould have from 9 to 11 ſtitches ; twelve holes are
                    worked in each cloth. Main courſes have marling holes from the clue to the lower
                    bow line cringle up the leech, and from the clue to the firſt buntline cringle
                    on the foot. Fore courſes have marling holes one eighth of the depth of the ſail
                    up the leech, and from the clue to the firſt buntline cringle at the foot. Main
                    and fore topſails have marling holes three feet each way from the clue and at
                    the top-brims. Spritſails, mizen topſails, lower ſtayſails, main and fore top
                    ſtayſails, and jibs, have marling holes two feet each way from the clues. All
                    other ſails are ſewed home to the clues. Marling holes of courſes are at three
                    fourths of the depth of the tablings at the clues from the rope, and thoſe of
                    topsails are at half the depth of the tablings at the clues and top-brim from
                    the rope.”</p>
                <p>The rope, which is ſewed on the edges of ſails to prevent their rending, and
                    which is called <hi rend="italic">bolt-rope,</hi> ſhould be well made of fine
                    yarn, ſpun from the bell Riga rhine hemp well topt, and ſewed on with good
                    Engliſh-made twine of three threads, ſpun 200 fathom to the pound ; the twine in
                    the royal navy is dipped in a compoſition made with bees-wax, 4 lbs ; hogs lard
                    5 lbs ; and clear turpentine one pound ; and in the merchant ſervice, in tar
                    ſoftened with oil. They ſhould be ſtoved in a ſtove by the heat of a flue, and
                    not in a baker’s oven or a ſtove tub ; and tarred in the beſt Stockholm tar. The
                    flexibility of them ſhould be always conſidered, in taking in the slack, which
                    mull rest on the judgment of the ſailmaker.</p>
                <p>" Bolt-ropes of courſes, topſails, and all other ſails, ſhould be neatly ſewed on
                    through every buntline of the rope ; and, to avoid ſtretching, the rope muſt be
                    kept tightly twiſted while ſewing on, and care taken that neither too much nor
                    too little slack is taken in ; they are to be croſs-ſtitched at the leeches
                    every twelve inches in length ; at every ſeam, and in the middle of every cloth
                    at the foot, with three croſs-ſtitches : four croſs-ſtitches ſhould be taken at
                    all beginnings and fastenings off ; the firſt ſtitch given twice, and the last

                    <hi rend="italic">Form Gauge,</hi> an inſtrument recommended by Mr Hutchinſon as
                    fit to aſcertain any alteration in the bottom of a ſhip, by its hogging or
                    sagging ; and alſo to regulate the ſtowage of a ſhip.</p>
                <p>“ All ſhips (ſays he) of any conſequence are built with ſtaunchions fixed from
                    the kelſon to the middle of all the lower-deck beams fore and aft, in order to
                    ſupport them in their exact, regular height, as well as the whole frame of the
                    ſhip in the regular form in which ſhe was built upon the ſtocks ; yet notwith-
                    ſtanding theſe ſtaunchions, it is proved from experience that our ſhips bottoms,
                    hitherto, by the preſſure of water, and improper ſtowage, have generally been
                    hogged upwards, or sagged downwards, and moſt about the midſhip frame or main
                    body of the ſhip, which is commonly about the fore part of the main hatchway ;
                    which naturally makes it the beſt place at which to fix the ſhip’s form gauge,
                    where either the hogging or fagging of her bottom may be obſerved and ſeen
                    ſooneſt and beſt, to regulate the ſtowage of heavy materials to the greateſt
                    advantage, ſo as to keep her bottom nearly in the same form in which ſhe was
                    built.</p>
                <p>“ The gauge I recommend is nothing more than a narrow plate of iron divided into
                    inches and quarters like the ſlide of a carpenter’s rule. Let this be fixed to
                    the after side of the ſtaunchion now mentioned, with its upper end projecting
                    two or three inches above the ſtaunchion ; a groove being cut out for it in the
                    after side of the lower-deck beam, and a mark being made (when the ſhip is on
                    the ſtocks) at the part of the beam which correſponds to the o on the gauge.
                    When the ſhip alters in her ſhape, the gauge will ſlide up and down in this
                    groove, and the quantity of hogging or lagging will be pointed out on the gauge
                    by the mark on the beam. The ſtowage may then be ſo managed as to bring this
                    mark to coincide again with the o, or to approach it as near as we ſee
                    neceſſary.”</p>

                    endeavoured after, if but to prevent, as much as poſſible, the danger of a ſhip
                    oversetting at ſea, or being ſo labourſome as to roll away her maſts, &amp;c. by
                    being improperly ſtowed, which is often the case.</p>
                <p>When a ſhip is new, it is prudent to consult the builder, who may be ſuppoſed
                    beſt acquainted with a ſhip of his own planning, and moſt likely to judge what
                    her properties will be, to adviſe how the cargo or materials, according to the
                    nature of them, ought to be diſpoſed of to advantage, ſo as to put her in the
                    beſt sailing trim ; and at every favourable opportunity afterwards it will be
                    proper to endeavour to find out her beſt trim by experiment.</p>
                <p>Ships muſt differ in their form and proportional dimenſions ; and to make them
                    anſwer their different purpoſes, they will require different management in the
                    ſtowage, which ought not to be left to mere chance, or done at random, as goods
                    or materials happen to come to hand, which is too often the cauſe that ſuch
                    improper ſtowage makes ſhips unfit for ſea : therefore the ſtowage ſhould be
                    conſidered, planned, and contrived, according to the built and properties of the
                    ſhip, which if they are not known ſhould be inquired after. If ſhe is narrow and
                    high-built in proportion, ſo that ſhe will not ſhift herſelf without a great
                    weight in the hold, it is a certain ſign ſuch a ſhip will require a great part
                    of heavy goods, ballaſt, or materials, laid low in the hold, to make her ſtiff
                    enough to bear ſufficient ſail without being in danger of overſetting. But if a
                    ſhip be built broad and low in proportion, ſo that ſhe is ſtiff and will ſupport
                    herſelf without any weight in the hold, ſuch a ſhip will require heavy goods,
                    ballaſt, or materials, ſtowed higher up, to prevent her from being too ſtiff and
                    labourſome at ſea, ſo as to endanger her maſts being rolled away, and the hull
                    worked looſe and made leaky.</p>
                <p>In order to help a ſhip’s ſailing, that ſhe ſhould be lively and eaſy in her
                    pitching and aſcending motions,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0441.tif"
                        xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0435"/> it ſhould be contrived by the ſtowage, that the
                    principal and weightieſt part of the cargo or materials ſhould lie as near the
                    main body of the ſhip, and as far ſrom the extreme ends, fore and aft, as things
                    will admit of. For it ſhould be conſidered, that the roomy part of our ſhips
                    lengthwiſe forms a ſweep or curve near four times as long as they are broad ;
                    therefore thoſe roomy parts at and above the water’s edge, which are made by a
                    full harping and a broad tranſom to ſupport the ſhip ſteady and keep her from
                    plunging into the ſea, and alſo by the entrance and run of the ſhip having
                    little or no bearing body under for the preſſure of the water to ſupport them,
                    of courſe ſhould not be flowed with heavy goods or materials, but all the
                    neceſſary vacancies, broken ſtowage, or light goods, ſhould be at theſe extreme
                    ends fore and aft ; and in proportion as they are kept lighter by the ſtowage,
                    the ſhip will be more lively to fall and riſe eaſy in great ſeas ; and this will
                    contribute greatly to her working and sailing, and to prevent her from ſtraining
                    and hogging ; for which reason it is a wrong practice to leave ſuch a large
                    vacancy in the main hatchway, as is uſual, to coil and work the cables, which
                    ought to be in the fore or after hatchway, that the principal weight may be more
                    eaſily flowed in the main body of the ſhip, above the flatteſt and loweſt
                    floorings, where the preſſure of the water acts the more to ſupport it.</p>

                    ourſelves to the machine invented by Francis Hopkinton, Eſq; Judge of the
                    Admiralty in Pennſylvania.—- After having ſhown the fallacies to which the
                    common log, and also that particular kind of infiniment invented by M. Saumarez,
                    are liable, he proceeds to deſcribe his own machine as follows :</p>
                <p>This machine, in its moſt simple form, is repreſented by fig. 5. Plate CCCCLIII.
                    wherein A B is a strong rod of iron moveable on the fulcrum C. D is a thin
                    circular palate of braſs rivetted to the lower extremity of the rod. E an
                    horizontal arm connected at orte end with the top of the rod AB by a moveable
                    joint F, and at the other end with the bottom of the index IT, by a like
                    moveable joint G. H is the index turning on its centre I, and travelling over
                    the graduated arch K ; and L is a ſtrong ſpring, bearing againſt the rod AB, and
                    conſtantly counteracting the preſſure upon the palate D. The rod AB ſhould be
                    applied cloſe to the cut-water or flem, and ſhould be of ſuch a length that the
                    palate D may be no higher above the keel than is neceſſary to ſecure it from
                    injury when the veſſel is aground, or ſails in ſhoal water. As the bow of the
                    ſhip curves inward towards the keel M, the palate D will be thrown to a diſtance
                    from the bottom of the veſſel, although the perpendicular rod to which it is
                    annexed lies cloſe to the bow above ; and therefore the palate will be more
                    fairly acted upon. The arm E ſhould enter the bow ſomewhere near the hawſe hole,
                    and lead to any convenient place in the forecastle, where a ſmooth board or
                    plate may be fixed, having the index H, and graduated arch K, upon it.</p>
                <p>It is evident from the figure, that as the ſhip is urged forward by the wind, the
                    palate D will be preſſed upon bv the reſiſting medium, with a greater or
                    leſs</p>
                <p>force, according to the progreſſive motion of the ſhip ; and this will operate
                    upon the levers to as to immediately affect the index, making the leaſt increase
                    or diminution of the ſhip’s way visible on the graduated arch ; the ſpring L
                    always counteracting the pressure upon the palate, and bringing back the index,
                    on any relaxation of the force impreſſed.</p>
                <p>This machine is advantageouſly placed at the bow of the ſhip, where the current
                    firſt begins, and acts fairly upon the palate, in preference to the item, where
                    the tumultuous cloſing of the waters cauſes a wake, visible to a great diſtance.
                    The palate D is ſunk neatly as low as the keel, that it may not be influenced by
                    the heaping up of the water and the daſhing of the waves at and near the water
                    line. The arch K is to ascertain how many knots or miles ſhe would run in one
                    hour at her then rate of ſailing. But the graduations on this arch muſt be
                    unequal ; becauſe the reſiſtance of the ſpring L will increaſe as it becomes
                    more bent, to that the index will travel over a greater ſpace from one to five
                    miles than from five to twelve. Laſtly, the palate, rod, ſpring, and all the
                    metallic parts of the inſtrument, ſhould be covered with a ſtrong varniſh, to
                    prevent ruſt from the corroſive quality of the ſalt water and ſea air.</p>
                <p>This machine may be conſiderably improved as follows : Let the rod or ſpear AB
                    (fig. 5.) be a round rod of iron or ſteel, and inſtead of moving on the fulcrum
                    or joint, as at C, let it paſs through and turn freely in a socket, to which
                    socket the moveable joint muſt be annexed, as repreſented in ſig. 6. The rod
                    muſt have a ſhoulder to bear on the upper edge of the socket, to prevent its
                    flipping quite down. The rod muſt also paſs through a like locket at F, fig. 5.
                    The joint of the lower socket muſt be fixed to the bow ot the ſhip, and the
                    upper joint or socket muſt be connected with the horizontal arm E. On the top of
                    the uppermoſt socket let there be a small circular plate, bearing the 32 points
                    of the manner’s compaſs; and let the top of the rod AB come through the centre
                    of this plate, to as to carry a ſmall index upon it, as is repreſented in fig.
                    7. This ſmall index muſt be fixed to the top of the rod on a ſquare, to that by
                    turning the index round the plate, the rod may alſo turn in the sockets, and of
                    courſe carry the palate D round with it ; the little index always pointing in a
                    direction with the face of the palate. The ſmall compaſs plate ſhould not be
                    fastened to the top of the socket, but only fitted tightly on, that it may be
                    moveable at pleaſure. Suppoſe then the intended port to bear S. W. from the
                    place of departure, the palate muſt be turned on the locket till the ſouth-weſt
                    point thereon looks directly to the ſhip’s bow ; to that the ſouth-weſt and
                    north-eaſt line on the compaſs plate may be preciſely parallel with the ſhip’s
                    keel, and in this poſition the plate muſt remain during the whole voyage.
                    Suppoſe, then, the ſhip to be ſailing in the direct courſe of her intended
                    voyage, with her bowſprit pointing ſouth-weſt. Let the little index be brought
                    to the ſouth-weſt point on the compaſs plate, and the palate ID will necessarily
                    preſent its broad face toward the port of deſtination ; and this it muſt always
                    be made to do, be the ſhip’s courſe what it may. If, on account of unfavourable
                    winds, the ſhip is obliged to deviate from her intended courſe, the little index
                    muſt be moved to many points from the south-weſt<pb
                        facs="gri_33125011196363_0442.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0436"/> line of the
                    compass plate as the compass in the binnacle ſhall ſltow that the deviates from
                    her true courſe ; ſo that in whatever direction the ſhip ſhall sail, the palate
                    D will always look full to the ſouth-weſt point of the horizon, or towards the
                    port of deſtination, and conſequently will preſent only an oblique ſurface to
                    the refilling medium, more or leſs oblique as the ſhip deviates more or leſs
                    from the true courſe of her voyage. As, therefore, the reſiſtance of the water
                    will operate leſs upon the palate in an oblique than in a direct poſition, in
                    exact proportion to its obliquity, the index H will not ſhow how many knots the
                    veſſel runs in her then courſe, but will indicate how many ſhe gains in the
                    direct line of her intended voyage—Thus, in fig. 9. if the ſhip’s courſe lies in
                    the direction of the line AB, but ſhe can ſail by the wind no nearer than AC ;
                    ſuppoſe, then, her progreſſive motion ſuch as to perform AC equal to five knots
                    or miles in an hour, yet the index H will only point to four knots on the
                    graduated arch, becauſe ſhe gains no more than at that rate on the true line of
                    her voyage, viz. ſrom A to B. Thus will the difference between her real motion
                    and that pointed out by the index be always in proportion to her deviation from
                    her intended port, until ſhe sails in a line at right angles therewith, as AD ;
                    in which case the palate would preſent only a thin ſharp edge to the refitting
                    medium, the preſſure of which ſhould not be ſufficient to overcome the friction
                    of the machine and the bearing of the ſpring L. So that at whatever rate the
                    ſhip may ſail on that line, yet the index will not be affected, ſhowing that ſhe
                    gains nothing on her true courſe. In this caſe, and alſo when the veſſel is not
                    under way, the action of the ſpring L ſhould cauſe the index to point at O, as
                    repreſented by the dotted lines in ſig. 5. and 8.</p>
                <p>As the truth of this infiniment muſt depend on the equal preſſure of the
                    resiſting medium upon the palate D, according to the ſhip’s velocity, and the
                    proportionable action of the ſpring L, there ſhould be a pin or ſcrew at the
                    joints C and F, ſo that the rod may be readily unſhipped and taken in, in order
                    to clean the palate from any foulneſs it may contract, which would greatly
                    increaſe its operation on the index H, and thereby render the graduated arch
                    falſe and uncertain.</p>
                <p>Further, the ſpring L may be expoſed too much to injury horn the ſalt water, if
                    fixed on the outſide of the ſhip s bow. To remedy this, it may be brought under
                    cover, by conducting the machine as represented by fig. 8. where AB is the rod,
                    C the fulcrum or centre of its motion, D the palate, E the horizontal arm
                    leading through a ſmall hole into the forecaſtle ; M is a ſtrong chain faſtened
                    at one end to the arm E, and at the other to a rim or barrel on the wheel G,
                    which by means of its teeth gives motion to the ſemicircle I and index H. The
                    ſpring L is ſpiral, and encloſed in a box or barrel, like the main ſpring of a
                    watch. A ſmall chain is fixed to, and paſſing round the barrel, is fastened by
                    the other end to the fuzee W. This fuzee is connected by its teeth with the
                    wheel G, and counteracts the motion of the palate D. N, N, are the two</p>
                <p>ſockets through which the rod AB paſſes, and in which it is turned round by means
                    of the little index R. S is the ſmall compaſs plate, moveable on the top of the
                    upper socket N. The plate S hath an upright rim round its edge, cut into teeth
                    or notches, ſo that when the index R is a little raised up, in order to bring it
                    round to any intended point, It may fall into one of theſe notches, and be
                    detained there ; otherwiſe the preſſure of the water will force the palate D
                    from its oblique position, and turn the rod and index round to the direction in
                    which the ſhip ſhall be then sailing.— Should it be apprehended that the palate
                    D, being placed ſo far forward, may affect the ſhip’s ſteerage, or obſtruct her
                    rate of sailing, it ſhould be considered that a very ſmall plate will be
                    ſufficient to work the machine, as one or three or four inches in diameter would
                    probably be ſufficient, and yet not large enough to have any ſensible effect on
                    the helm or ſhip’s way.</p>
                <p>The greateſt difficulty, perhaps, will be in graduating the arch K, (if the
                    machine is conſtructed as in fig. 5.) ; the unequal divisions of which can only
                    be aſcertained by actual experiment on board of each ſhip respectively, inasmuch
                    as the accuracy of theſe graduations will depend on three circumſtances, viz.
                    the position of the fulcrum C with reſpect to the length of the rod, the ſize of
                    the palate D, and the ſtrength or bearing of the spring L. When these
                    graduations, however, are once aſcertained for the machine on board of any one
                    veſſel, they will not want any future alterations, provided the palate D be kept
                    clean, and the ſpring L retains its elaſticity.</p>
                <p>But the unequal diviſions of the graduated arch will be unneceſtary, if the
                    machine is conſtructed as in fig. 8.; for as the chain goes round the barrel L,
                    and then winds through the ſpiral channel of the fuzee W, the force of the main
                    ſpring muſt operate equally, or nearly ſo, in all poſitions of the index, and
                    conſequently the diviſions of the arch K may in ſuch caſe be equal.</p>
                <p>After all, it is not expected that a ſhip’s longitude can be determined to a
                    mathematical certainty by this inſtrument. The irregular motions and impulſes to
                    which a ſhip is continually expoſed, make ſuch an accuracy unattainable perhaps
                    by any machinery : But if it ſhould be found, as we flatter ourſelves it will on
                    fair experiment, that it anſwers the purpoſe much better than the common log, it
                    may be conſidered as an acquiſition to the art of navigation.</p>
                <p>It ſhould be obſerved, that in aſcertaining a ſhip’s longitude by a time-piece,
                    this great inconvenience occurs, that a ſmall and trifling miſtake in the time
                    makes a very great and dangerous error in the diſtance run. Whereas the errors
                    of this machine will operate no farther than their real amount ; which can never
                    be great or dangerous, if corrected by the uſual obſervations made by mariners
                    for correcting the common log.</p>
                <p>A like machine, made in its ſimple form (as at fig.5.), ſo conſtructed as to ſhip
                    and unſhip, might occaſionally, be applied alongſide about midſhips, in order to
                    aſcertain the leeway ; which, if rightly ſhown, will give the ſhip’s preciſe
                    longitude. As to ſea currents, this and all other machines hitherto invented
                    muſt be ſubject to them influence ; and proper allowances muſt be made according

                    moment ſhould be choſen for the obſervation ; not whilst the ſhip is rapidly
                    deſcending the declivity of a wave, or is ſuddenly checked by a ſtroke of the
                    ſea, or is in the very act of plunging. In all caſes, periods may be found in
