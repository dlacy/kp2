<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">verſariee, </span><span class="font1">by way of contempt. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Their fate </span><span class="font1">was very ſevere, being perſecuted with unparalleled fury ; and&nbsp;though many princes of the blood, and of the firſt nobility, had embraced their ſentiments, yet in no part of&nbsp;the world did the reformers ſuffer ſo muchf. At laſt&nbsp;all commotions were quelled by the fortitude and mag-<sup>1</sup> nanimity of Henry IV. who in the year 1598 granted&nbsp;all his ſubjects full liberty of conſcience by the famous&nbsp;Edict of Nantes, and ſeemed to have thoroughly eſtabliſhed the reformation throughout his dominions. Du-ring the minority of Louis XIV. however, this edict&nbsp;was revoked by Cardinal Mazarine, -ſince which time&nbsp;the Proteſtants have often been cruelly perſecuted ; nor&nbsp;was the profeſſion of the reformed religion in France at&nbsp;any time fo ſafe as in moſt other countries of Europe.&nbsp;See Revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the other parts of Europe the oppoſition to the church of Rome was but faint and ambiguous before&nbsp;the diet of Augſhurg. Before that period, however,&nbsp;it appears from undoubted teſtimony, that the doctrine&nbsp;of Luther had made a conſiderable, though probably&nbsp;ſecret, progreſs through Spain, Hungary, Bohemia,&nbsp;Britain, Poland, and the Netherlands ; and had in all&nbsp;theſe countries many friends, of whom ſeveral repaired&nbsp;to wittemberg, in order to enlarge their knowledge&nbsp;by means of Luther’s converfation. Some of theſe&nbsp;countries threw off the Romiſh yoke entirely, and in&nbsp;others a prodigious number of families embraced the&nbsp;principles of the reformed religion. 'It is certain in-deed, and the Roman-catholics themſelves acknowledge&nbsp;it without heſitation, that the Papal doctrines and authority would have fallen into ruin in all parts of the&nbsp;world at once, had not the force of the ſecular arm&nbsp;been employed to ſupport the tottering edifice. In the&nbsp;Netherlands particularly, the moſt grievous perſecutions&nbsp;took place, fo that by the emperor Charles V. upwards&nbsp;of 100,000 were deſtroyed, while ſtill greater cruelties&nbsp;were exerciſed upon the people by his ſon Philip II.&nbsp;The revolt of the United Provinces, however, and motives of real policy, at laſt put a ſtop to theſe furiou3&nbsp;proceedings ; and, though in many provinces of the&nbsp;Netherlands, the eſtabliſhment of the Popiſh religion&nbsp;was ſtill continued, the Proteſtants have been long&nbsp;free of the dangeι of perſecution on account of their&nbsp;principles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The reformation made a conſiderable progreſs in Spain and Italy foon after the rupture between Luther and the Roman pontiff. In ail the provinces of&nbsp;Italy, but more eſpecially in the territories of venice,&nbsp;Tuſcany, and Naples, the ſuperſtition of Rome loſt&nbsp;ground, and great numbers of people of all ranks expreſſed an averſion to the Papal yoke. This occafioned violent and dangerous commotions in the kingdom&nbsp;cf Naples in the year 1546 ; which, however, were at&nbsp;laſt quelled by the united efforts of Charles V. and his&nbsp;viceroy Don Pedro di Toledo. In ſeveral places the&nbsp;pope put a ſtop to the progreſs of the reformation, by&nbsp;letting lo»fe the inquiſitors ; who ſpread dreadful marks&nbsp;©f their barbarity through the greattſt part of Italy.&nbsp;Theſe formidable miniſters of ſuperſtition put ſo many&nbsp;to death, and perpetrated ſuch horrid acts of cruelty and&nbsp;.oppreſſion, that moſt of the reformed conſulted their&nbsp;ſafety by a voluntary exile, while others returned to&nbsp;the religion of Rome, at leaſt in external appearance.&nbsp;'But the inquiſition, which frighted into the profeſſion&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">Popery ſeveral </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Proteſtants in </span><span class="font1">other parts of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Italy,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">could never make its way </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">into thc </span><span class="font1">kingdom of Naples; nor could either the authority or intreaties of the&nbsp;pope engage the NeapoIitans to admit even vifiting in-quiſitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Spain, ſeveral people embraced the Proteſtant. religion, not only from the controverses of Luther, but&nbsp;even from thoſe divines whom Charles V. had brought&nbsp;with him into Germany in order to refute the doctrines of Luther. For theſe doctors imbibed the pre-tended hereſy inſtead of refuting it, and propagated&nbsp;it more or leſs on their return home. But the inquiſition, which could obtain no footing in Naples, reigned triumphant in Spain, and by the moſt dreadful methods frightened the people back into Popery, and&nbsp;ſuppreſſcd the deſire of exchanging their ſuperſtition&nbsp;for a more rational plan of ιeligion. It was indeed&nbsp;preſumed that Charles himfelf died </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">Proteſtant ; and&nbsp;it ſeems to be certain, that, when the approach of dcath&nbsp;had diſſipated thofe ſchemes of ambition and grandeur&nbsp;which had fo long blinded him, his ſentimeuts became&nbsp;much more rational and agreeable to Chriſtianity than&nbsp;they had ever been. All the eccleſiaſtics who had attended him, as ſoon as he expired, were ſent to the&nbsp;inquiſition, and committed to the flames, or put to&nbsp;death by ſome other method equally terrible. Such&nbsp;was the fate of Auguſtine Caſal, the emperor’s preacher ; of Conſtantine Pontius, his confeſſor ; of Egidius,&nbsp;whom he had named to the biſhopric of Tortoſa; of Bartholomew de Caranza, a Dominican, who had been confeſſor to King Philip and Queen Mary ; with 20 others,&nbsp;of leſs note.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In England, the principles of the reformation began to be adopted as ſoon as an account of Luther’s doctrines could be conveyed thither. In that kingdom&nbsp;there werc ſtill great remains of the ſect called Lo∕-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lards<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font1">  whoſe doctrine reſembled that of Luther ; and&nbsp;among whom, of conſequence, the ſentiments of our&nbsp;reformer gained great credit. Henry VIII. king of&nbsp;England at that time was a violent partiſan of the&nbsp;church of Rome, and had a particular veneration for&nbsp;the writings of Thomas Aψιinas. Being informed&nbsp;that Luther ſpoke of his favourite author with con-tempt, he conceived a violent prejudice &quot;againſt the reformer, and even wrote againſt him, as we have already&nbsp;obſerved. Luther did not heſitate at writing againſt&nbsp;his majeſty, overcame him in argument, and treated&nbsp;him with very little ceremony. The firſt ſtep towards&nbsp;public reformation, however, was not taken till the&nbsp;year *529. Great complaints had been made in Eng-land, and of a very ancient date, of the uſurpations of&nbsp;the clergy ; and by the prevalence of the Lutheran&nbsp;opinions, thefe complaints were now become more general than before. The Houfe of Commons, finding&nbsp;the occaſion favourable, paſſed ſeveral bills, reſtraining&nbsp;the impoſitions of the clergy : but what threatened the&nbsp;eccleſiaſtical order with the greateſt danger were the&nbsp;ſevere rt proaches thrown out almoſt without oppoſition&nbsp;in the houſe againſt the diffolute lives, ambition, and&nbsp;avarice of the prieſts, and their continual encroach-ments on the privileges of the laity. The bills for regulating the clergy met with oppoſition in the Houſe&nbsp;of Lords ; and biſhop Fiſher imputed them to want of&nbsp;faith in the Commons, and to a formed deſign, pro-ceeding from heretical and Lutheran principles, of robbing the church of her patrimony, and overturning the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">national religion. </span><span class="font1">The Commons., however, complain-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
