<p><span class="font1">by the horrors of her own creations, but the nearest approach to eccentricity on Mrs Radcliffe’s part was dislike of public&nbsp;notice. Of scenery Mrs Radcliffe was an enthusiastic admirer,&nbsp;and she made driving tours, with her husband every other&nbsp;summer through the English counties. She died on the&nbsp;7th of February 1823. In the history of the English novel,&nbsp;Mrs Radcliffe holds an interesting place. She is too often&nbsp;confounded with her imitators, who vulgarized her favourite&nbsp;“ properties ” of rambling and ruinous old castles, dark,&nbsp;desperate and cadaverous villains, secret passages, vaults,&nbsp;trapdoors, evidences of deeds of monstrous crime, sights and&nbsp;sounds of mysterious horror. She deserves at least the credit&nbsp;of originating a school of which she was the most distinguished&nbsp;exponent; and none of her numerous imitators approach&nbsp;her in ingenuity of plot, fertility of incident or skill in devising&nbsp;apparently supernatural occurrences capable of explanation&nbsp;by human agency and natural coincidence. She had a genuine&nbsp;gift for scenic effect, and her vivid imagination provided every&nbsp;tragic situation in her stories with its appropriate setting.&nbsp;Sir Walter Scott wrote an appreciative essay for the edition&nbsp;of 1824, and Miss Christina Rossetti was one of her admirers.&nbsp;She exercised a great influence on her contemporaries, and&nbsp;“ Schedoni ” in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Italian</span><span class="font1"> is one of the prototypes of the&nbsp;Byronic hero.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADCLIFFE, SIR GEORGE (1593-1657), English politician, son of Nicholas Radcliffe (d. 1599) of Overthorpe, Yorkshire,&nbsp;was educated at Oldham and at University College, Oxford.&nbsp;He attained some measure of success as a barrister, and about&nbsp;1626 became the confidential adviser of Sir Thomas Wentworth,&nbsp;afterwards earl of Strafford, who was related to his wife, Anne&nbsp;Trappes (d. 1659). Like his master he was imprisoned in 1627&nbsp;for declining to contribute to a forced loan, but he shared the&nbsp;good, as well as the ill, fortunes of Wentworth, acting as his&nbsp;adviser when he was president of the council of the north.&nbsp;When Wentworth was made lord deputy of Ireland, Radcliffe, in&nbsp;January 1633, preceded him to that country, and having been&nbsp;made a member of the Irish privy council he was trusted by the&nbsp;deputy in the fullest possible way, his advice being of the greatest&nbsp;service. In 1640, Radcliffe, like Strafford, was arrested and was&nbsp;impeached, but the charges against him were not pressed, and in&nbsp;1643 he was with Charles I. at Oxford. He died at Flushing in&nbsp;May 1657. Radcliffe wrote </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">An essay towards the life of my Lord&nbsp;Strafford,</span><span class="font1"> from which the material for the various lives of the&nbsp;statesman has been largely taken.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RADCLIFFE, JOHN (1650-1714), English physician, was born at Wakefield in 1650. He matriculated at University&nbsp;College, Oxford, and after taking his degree in 1669 was elected&nbsp;to a fellowship at Lincoln College, which he gave up in 1677 when,&nbsp;under the statutes of the college, he was called on to take orders.&nbsp;Graduating in medicine in 1675, he practised first in Oxford, but&nbsp;in 1684 removed to London, where he soon became one of the&nbsp;leading physicians. He frequently attended William III. until&nbsp;1699, when he caused offence by remarking, as he looked at the&nbsp;King’s swollen ankles, that he would not have his legs for his&nbsp;three kingdoms. - On the 1st of November 1714 he died of&nbsp;apoplexy at his house in Carshalton. By his will he left pro-perty to University College for founding two medical travelling&nbsp;fellowships and for other purposes. Other property was put&nbsp;at the disposal of his executors to use as they thought best, and&nbsp;was employed, among other things, in building the Radcliffe&nbsp;Observatory, Hospital and Library at Oxford, and in enlarging&nbsp;St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London. Radcliffe was elected&nbsp;M. P. for Bramber in 1690 and for Buckingham in 1713.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADCLIFFE, an urban district in the Radcliffe-cum-Farnworth parliamentary division of Lancashire, England, on the river Irwell, 2 m. S. S.W. of Bury, on the Lancashire &amp;&nbsp;Yorkshire railway. Pop. (1901) 25,368. The church of St&nbsp;Bartholomew dates from the time of Henry IV.; some of the&nbsp;Norman portions of the building remain. Cotton-weaving,&nbsp;calico-printing, and bleaching, dyeing, paper-making, ironfounding and machine-making are the principal industries,&nbsp;and there are extensive collieries in the neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADEBERG, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Saxony, pleasantly situated in a fertile district on the Röder, 10 m. N. E.&nbsp;of Dresden, by the railway to Görlitz and Breslau. Pop. (1905)&nbsp;13, 301. It has an Evangelical and a Roman Catholic church,&nbsp;and an old castle. Its principal industries are the manufacture&nbsp;of glass, machinery, furniture and paper, and it produces a&nbsp;light Pilsener beer which is largely exported. Near the town are&nbsp;the Augustusbad and the Hermannsbad, two medicinal springs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RADEGUNDA, ST (d. 587), Frankish queen, was the daughter of Berthaire, king of the Thuringians. Berthaire was killed by&nbsp;his brother Hermannfried, who took Radegunda and educated&nbsp;her, but was himself slain by the Frankish kings Theuderich&nbsp;and Clotaire (529), and Radegunda fell to Clotaire, who later&nbsp;married her. Her piety was already so noteworthy that it was&nbsp;said that Clotaire had married a nun, not a queen. She left&nbsp;him when he unjustly killed her brother, and fled to Medardus,&nbsp;bishop of Poitiers, who, notwithstanding the danger of the&nbsp;act, consecrated her as a nun. Radegunda stayed in Poitiers,&nbsp;founded a monastery there, and lived for a while in peace. Here&nbsp;Venantius Fortunatus, the Italian poet, found a friendly reeep-tion, and two of the poems printed under his name are usually&nbsp;attributed to Radegunda. From him we gain a most pleasing&nbsp;picture of life at the monastery. The queen died on the 13th of&nbsp;August 587. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RADETZKY, JOSEF, Count of Radetz (1706-1858), Austrian soldier, was born at Trzebnitz in Bohemia in 1766, to the&nbsp;nobility of which province his family, originally Hungarian,&nbsp;had for several centuries belonged. Orphaned at an early age,&nbsp;he was educated by his grandfather, and after the old count's&nbsp;death, at the Theresa academy at Vienna. The academy was&nbsp;dissolved during his first year’s residence, and he joined the army&nbsp;as a cadet in 1785. Next year he became an officer, and in 1787&nbsp;a first lieutenant in a cuirassier regiment. He served as a&nbsp;galloper on Lacy’s staff in the Turkish War, and in the Low&nbsp;Countries during the Revolutionary War. In 1795 he fought&nbsp;on the Rhine. Next year he served with Beaulieu against&nbsp;Napoleon in Italy, and inwardly rebelled at the indecisive&nbsp;“ cordon ” system of warfare which his first chief, Lacy, had&nbsp;instituted and other Austrian generals only too faithfully&nbsp;imitated. His personal courage was conspicuous; at Fleurus&nbsp;he had led a party of cavalry through the French lines to discover&nbsp;the fate of Charleroi, and at Valeggio on the Mincio, with a&nbsp;few hussars, he rescued Beaulieu from the midst of the enemy.&nbsp;Promoted major, he took part in Wurmser’s Mantua campaign,&nbsp;which ended in the fall of the place. As lieutenant-colonel and&nbsp;colonel he displayed both bravery and skill in the battles of the&nbsp;Trebbia and Novi (1799), and at Marengo, as colonel on the staff&nbsp;of Melas, he was hit by five bullets, after endeavouring on the&nbsp;previous evening to bring about modifications in the plan sug-gested by the “ scientific ” Zach. In 1801 Radetzky received&nbsp;the knighthood of the Maria Theresa order. In 1805, on the&nbsp;march to Ulm, he received news of his promotion to major-general and his assignment to a command in Italy under the&nbsp;archduke Charles, and thus took part in the successful campaign&nbsp;of Caldiero. Peace again afforded him a short leisure, which he&nbsp;used in studying and teaching the art of war. In 1809, now a&nbsp;lieutenant field marshal, he fought at Wagram, and in 1810 he&nbsp;received the commandership of the Maria Theresa order and the&nbsp;colonelcy of the 5th Radetzky hussars. From 1809 to 1812, as&nbsp;chief of the general staff, he was active in the reorganization of&nbsp;the army and its tactical system, but, unable to carry out the&nbsp;reforms he desired owing to the opposition of the Treasury, he&nbsp;resigned the post. In 1813 he was Schwarzenberg’s chief of&nbsp;staff, and as such had considerable influence on the councils of the Allied sovereigns and generals. Langenau, the quartermaster-general of the Grand Army, found him an indispensable&nbsp;assistant, and he had a considerable share in planning the&nbsp;Leipzig campaign and as a tactician won great praises in the</span></p>
