a manufacturing town in an isolated portion of Prussian Saxony, is picturesquely situated on the Lauter, on the southern slope of the Thuringian Forest, 6½ miles to the north-east of Meiningen and 29 miles to the southwest of Erfurt. The armourers of Suhl are mentioned as early as the 9th century, but they enjoyed their highest vogue from 1550 to 1634. The knights of south Germany especially prized the swords and armour of this town, and many of the weapons used in the mediæval campaigns against the Turks and in the Seven Years’ War are said to have been manufactured at Suhl. Its old popular name of the “ armoury of Germany ” is more appropriate, however, to its past than to its present position, for, already seriously crippled by the ravages of the Thirty Years’ War and by frequent conflagrations, it has suffered considerably in more modern times from the competition of other towns, especially since the introduction of the needle-gun. It still contains, however, large factories for firearms (military and sporting) and side arms, besides iron-works, machine- works, potteries, and tanneries. The once considerable manufacture of fustian has declined. A brine spring (Soolquelle) at the foot of the neighbouring Domberg is said to have given name to the town. The population in 1880 was 9937 and 10,605 in 1885. Suhl, made a town in 1527, belonged to the early principality of Henneberg, and formed part of the possessions of the kingdom of Saxony assigned to Prussia by the congress of Vienna.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
