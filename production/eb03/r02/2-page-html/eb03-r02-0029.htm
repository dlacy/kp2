<p><span class="font0">hindered from the reading of it, ſuch opρofers and hin-derers are felons without benefit of clergy ; and all perſons to whom ſuch proclamation </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ought to have been made,</span><span class="font0"> and knowing of ſuch hindrance, and not diſ-perſing, are felons without benefit of clergy. There&nbsp;is the like indemnifying clauſe, in caſe any of the mob&nbsp;be unfortunately killed in the endeavour to diſperſe&nbsp;them ; being copied ſrom the act of queen Mary. And&nbsp;by a fubſequent clauſe of the new act, if any perſon, ſo&nbsp;riotouſly aſſembled, begin even before proclamation to&nbsp;pull down any church, chapel, meeting-houſe, dwell-ing-houſe, or out-houſes, they ſhall be felons without&nbsp;benefit of clergy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Riots, routs, and unlawful aſſemblies, muſt have three perſons at leaſt to conſtitute them. An </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">unlawful af-ſembly</span><span class="font0"> is, when three, or more, do aſſemble themſelves&nbsp;together to do an unlawful act, as to pull down incloſures, to deſtroy a warren or the game therein ; and&nbsp;part without doing it, or making any motion towards&nbsp;it. A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rout</span><span class="font0"> is where three or more meet to do an unlawful act upon a common quarrel, as forcibly breaking down fences upon a right claimed of common, or&nbsp;of way, and make ſome advances towards it. A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">riot&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">is where three or more actually do an unlawful act of&nbsp;violence, either with or without a common cauſe or&nbsp;quarrel ; as if they beat a man ; or hunt and kill game&nbsp;in another’s park, chaſe, warren, or liberty ; or do any&nbsp;other unlawful act with force and violence ; or even do&nbsp;a lawful act, as removing a nuiſance, in a violent and&nbsp;tumultuous manner. The puniſhment of unlawful aſſemblies, if to the number of 12, we have juſt now ſeen,&nbsp;may be capital, according to the circumſtances that attend it ; but, ſrom the number of three to eleven, is&nbsp;by fine and impriſonment only. The ſame is the caſe&nbsp;in riots and routs by the common law ; to which the&nbsp;pillory in very enormous caſes has been ſometimes ſu-peradded. And by the ſtatute 13 Hen. IV. c. 7. any&nbsp;two juſtices, together with the ſheriff or under-ſheriff&nbsp;of the county, may come with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">po[fe cornitatus,</span><span class="font0"> if&nbsp;need be, and ſuppreſs any ſuch riot, aſſembly, or rout,&nbsp;arreſt the rioters, and record upon the ſpot the nature&nbsp;and circumſtances of the whole tranſaction ; which record alone ſhall be a ſufficient conviction of the offenders. In the interpretation of which ſtatute it hath&nbsp;been holden, that all perſons, noblemen and others,&nbsp;except women, clergymen, perſons decrepit, and infants under 15, are bound to attend the juſtices in ſup-preſſing a riot, upon pain of fine and impriſonment;&nbsp;and that any battery, wounding, or killing the rioters,&nbsp;that may happen in ſuppreſſing the riot, is juſtiſiable.&nbsp;So that our ancient law, previous to the modern riot-act, ſeems pretty well to have guarded againſt any violent breach of the public peace ; eſpecially as any riotous aſſembly on a public or general account, as to re-dreſs grievances or pull down all 1nclofure3, and alſo re-ſiſting the king’s forces if ſent to keep the peace, may&nbsp;amount to overt acts of high treaſon, by levying war&nbsp;againſt the king.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RIPEN, a town of Denmark, in north Jutland, and capital of a dioceſe of the ſame name, with a biſhop’s ſee, a good harbour, a caſtle, two colleges, and&nbsp;a public library.

<p><span class="font0">RIPENING </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">of Grain,</span><span class="font0"> means its arriving to maturity. The following paper, which appeared in the firſt volume of the Transactions of the Royal Society of E-dinburgh, may be worthy the attention of farmers in&nbsp;this country ; where it frequently happens, from continued rains, that the corn is quite green when the ſroſt&nbsp;ſets in ; in conſequence of which, the farmers cut it&nbsp;down, without thinking it can poſſibly arrive at further&nbsp;maturity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Summer 1782 having been remarkably cold and unfavourable, the harveſt was very late, and much of&nbsp;the grain, eſpecially oats, was green even in October,&nbsp;In the beginning of October the cold was ſo great,&nbsp;that, in one night, there was produced on ponds near&nbsp;Kinneil, in the neighbourhood of Borrowſtounneſs, ice&nbsp;three quarters of an inch thick. It was apprehended&nbsp;by many farmers, that ſuch a degree of cold would effectually prevent the further filling and ripening of their&nbsp;corn. In order to aſcertain this point, Dr Roebuck ſelected ſeveral ſtalks of oats, of nearly equal&nbsp;fulneſs, and immediately cut thoſe which, on the moſt&nbsp;attentive compariſon, appeared the beſt, and marked the&nbsp;others, but allowed them to remain in the field 14&nbsp;days longer ; at the end of which time they, too, were&nbsp;cut, and kept in a dry room for 10 days. The grains&nbsp;of each parcel were then weighed ; when 11 of the&nbsp;grains which had been left ftanding in the field were&nbsp;found to be equal in weight to 30 of the grains which&nbsp;had been cut a fortnight ſooner, though even the beſt&nbsp;of the grains were far from being ripe. During that,&nbsp;fortnight (viz. from October 7th to October 2iſt) the&nbsp;average heat, according to Fahrenheit’s thermometer,&nbsp;which was obſerved every day at eight o’clock in the&nbsp;morning and fix in the evening, was a little above 43 „&nbsp;Dr Roebuck obſerves, that this ripening and filling of&nbsp;corn in ſo low a temperature ſhould be the leſs ſurpri-fing to us, when we reflect, that ſeed-corn will vegetate&nbsp;in the ſame degree of heat ; and he draws an important&nbsp;inference from his obſervations, viz. That farmers ſhotild&nbsp;be cautious of cutting down their unripe corn, on the&nbsp;ſuppofition that in a cold autumn it could fill no more.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A writer in the Scots Magazine ſor June 1792, under the ſignature of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agricola,</span><span class="font0"> when ſpeaking on this ſubject,&nbsp;adds the following piece of information, viz. “ That&nbsp;grain cut down before it is quite ripe will grow or ſpring&nbsp;equally well as ripe and plump grain, provided it is properly preferred. I relate this from a fact, and alſo oa&nbsp;the authority of one of the moſt judicious and experienced farmers in this iſland, William Craik of ArbigLnd,&nbsp;Eſq; near Dumfries, who was taught by ſuch a ſeaſon&nbsp;as this threatens to prove. This being the caſe, every&nbsp;wife economical farmer will preſerve his ripe and plump&nbsp;grain for bread, and ſow the green and ſeemingly ſhri-velled grain, with a perfect conviction that the plants&nbsp;proceeding from ſuch feed will yield as ſtrong and thriving corn as what grows from plump feed. By this&nbsp;means the farmer will enjoy the double advantage of&nbsp;having the corn moſt productive in flour for bread, and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
