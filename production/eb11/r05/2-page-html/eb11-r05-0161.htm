                treat them as a&nbsp;mere excrescence on the national life, a malignant growth to
                be&nbsp;removed by a necessary operation. In 1909 the number of&nbsp;exiles for

                purged and packed by an ingenious franchise&nbsp;system, was in its third year

                government. It is&nbsp;proposed to trace briefly the steps by which this result
                was&nbsp;obtained.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">In order to explain the course of the revolution which came to a head
                in 1905 it is necessary to say a few words about constitutional plans and Eberal
                experiments, initiated from&nbsp;above, which had preceded it. Of the ancient

                the great&nbsp;boyars in the 17th century, had met but once since the days
                of&nbsp;Peter the Great.@@<sup>2</sup> The origin of the present constitution
                of&nbsp;Russia must be sought, not in this ancient and obsolete institution, but in
                the artificial constitution elaborated by Mikhail&nbsp;Speranski (g.u.) in 1809 at
                the instance of the emperor Alexander</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">I. Of Speranski’s plan only the establishment of the
                Imperial&nbsp;Council (January 1st, 1810) was realized in his
                    lifetime.@@<sup>3</sup> In&nbsp;1864, however, the emperor Alexander II. carried
                the scheme&nbsp;a step further by the creation of elected provincial
                assemblies&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"

                class="font0">were added. The opportunity thus given for debate
                naturally&nbsp;stimulated the movement in favour of constitutional government, which
                received new impulses from the sympathetic attitude&nbsp;of the emperor Alexander
                II., his grant in 1879 of a constitution&nbsp;to the liberated principality of
                Bulgaria, and the multiplication&nbsp;of Nihilist outrages which pointed to the
                necessity of conciliating&nbsp;Liberal opinion in order to present a united front
                against revolutionary agitation. In January 1881 Count Loris-Melikov,&nbsp;minister
                of the interior, proposed to convene a “ general commission ” to examine legislative
                proposals before these were laid&nbsp;before the Imperial Council; this commission
                was to consist of&nbsp;members elected by the </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> and the larger towns,
                and&nbsp;others nominated in the provinces having no </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;plan was
                approved by Alexander II. on the very morning of&nbsp;his assassination (February
                17th, 1881), but it was never promulgated. The new tsar, Alexander III., was an apt
                pupil of his&nbsp;tutor Pobedonostsev </span><span class="font0"

                procurator of the&nbsp;Holy Synod, for whom the representative system was&nbsp;“ a
                modern lie,” and his reign covered a period of frank&nbsp;reaction, during which
                there was not only no question of&nbsp;granting any fresh liberties but those
                already conceded&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >(e.g.</span><span class="font0"> the principle of the separation of the
                administrative and&nbsp;judicial functions) were largely curtailed. The result of
                this&nbsp;policy of repression, associated as it was with gross incompetence and
                corruption in the organs of the administration,&nbsp;was the rapid spread of the
                revolutionary movement, which&nbsp;gradually permeated the intelligent classes and
                ultimately&nbsp;affected even the stolid and apparently immovable masses of&nbsp;the
                peasantry.</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font0">The movement came to a head, as a result of the disasters of the
                    war with Japan, in 1904. The assassination of the&nbsp;minister of the interior
                    Plchve, on the 14th of July,&nbsp;by the revolutionist Sazonov was remarkable as
                    a&nbsp;symptom mainly owing to the widespread sympathy&nbsp;of the European
                    press of all shades of opinion with&nbsp;the motives of the assassin. It was
                    clear that the system with&nbsp;which the murdered minister’s name had been
                    associated stood&nbsp;all but universally condemned, and in the appointment
                    of&nbsp;the conciliatory Prince Sviatopolk-Mirski as his successor&nbsp;the tsar
                    himself seemed to concede the necessity for a change&nbsp;of
                        policy.@@<sup>4</sup> In November, with the tacit consent of&nbsp;the
                    police, a private assembly of eminent members&nbsp;of local </span><span
                    class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos</span><span class="font0"> and
                    municipal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >dumas</span><span class="font0"> was held&nbsp;in St Petersburg to discuss the
                    situation. The majority of&nbsp;this decided to approach the crown with a
                    suggestion for&nbsp;a reform of the Russian system on the basis of a
                    national&nbsp;representative assembly, an extension of local
                    self-government,&nbsp;and wider guarantees for individual liberty. The day
                    on&nbsp;which the deputation laid these views before Prince Mirski&nbsp;was
                    hailed by public opinion as recalling the 5th of May 1789,&nbsp;the date of the
                    meeting of the French states-general at&nbsp;Versailles. The emperor, however,
                    whatever his own views,&nbsp;was surrounded by reactionary influences, of which
                    the most&nbsp;powerful were the empress-mother, Pobedonostsev the procurator of
                    the Holy Synod, Count Muraviev and the Grand-duke Sergius. The imperial

                    public opinion; for there was&nbsp;no word in it of constitutional government.
                    Petitions continued to flow in to the emperor’s cabinet, praying for a
                    national&nbsp;representation, from the </span><span class="font0"
                    style="font-style:italic;">zemstvos,</span><span class="font0"> from the

                    by general agitation, by partial strikes,&nbsp;and by outrages which culminated
                    at Moscow in the&nbsp;murder of the Grand-duke Sergius (February 4th, 1905).
                    In&nbsp;the imperial counsels the resisting forces still seemed to have&nbsp;the
                    upper hand. Prince Mirski resigned, his resignation being&nbsp;immediately
                    followed by a reactionary imperial manifesto&nbsp;reaffirming the principle of
                    autocracy (February 18th).&nbsp;Bulygin, Mirski’s successor, had no knowledge of
                    this until&nbsp;after its publication; he hastened to the tsar and
                    obtained&nbsp;the issue on the same day of a rescript which, while
                    reserving&nbsp;the “ fundamental laws of the empire ” inviolate, stated
                    the&nbsp;emperor’s Intention of summoning the representatives of the&nbsp;people
                    to aid in “ the preparation and examination of legislative&nbsp;proposals.” A
                    commission of inquiry, under the emperor’s&nbsp;presidency, was now established
                    tb elaborate the means for&nbsp;carrying this promise into effect. On the 6th of
                    June, in reply&nbsp;to a deputation of the second congress of </span><span

                    headed by&nbsp;Prince Trubetzkoi, the emperor promised the speedy convocation of
                    a National Assembly. When, however, on the 6th of&nbsp;August, the new law was
                    promulgated, it was found that the&nbsp;<sup>a</sup> Imperial Duma ”@@<sup>5
                    </sup>was to be no more than a consultative&nbsp;body, charged with the
                    examination of legislative proposals&nbsp;before these came before the Imperial
                    Council, the duty&nbsp;and right of passing them into law being still reserved
                    for the&nbsp;autocrat alone. The members of the Duma, moreover, were&nbsp;placed
                    at the mercy of the government by a clause empowering the Directing Senate to
                    suspend or deprive them.) The&nbsp;promulgation of this truncated constitution
                    was greeted by a&nbsp;furious agitation, culminating in September in a general
                    strike,&nbsp;rightly described as the most remarkable political
