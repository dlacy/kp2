Hugh, called the <hi rend="italic">Great, </hi>whom he had had by Confiance, being dead, he cauſed his ſecond ſon Henry I. to be crowned at Rheims. He died at. Melun, July 20. 103i, at the age of 60. Robert was, according to the knowledge of the times, a wiſe prince. Helgand, friar of Fleury, relates, in his life of him, that, to prevent his ſubjects from falling into the crime of perjuιy, and incurring the penalties which followed thereon, he made them ſwear upon a ſhrine ſrom which the relics had been previouſly removed, as if intention did not conſtitute perjury ! and long after ſimilar reafoning was adopted. Robert built a gſeat number of churches, and procured a reſtitution to the clergy of the tithes and wealth which the lay-lords had made themſelves maſters of. The depredations were ſuch, that the laity poſſeſſed the eccleſiaſti-cal treaſurcs by hereditary titles ; they divided them among their children ; they even gave benefices as a dowry with their daughters, or leſt them to their foils as lawful inheritance. Although Robert was pious, and although he reſpected the clergy, yet it was evident that he oppoſed the biſhops with a firmneſs and reſolution of which, for many ages, they had had no examples. Lutherie archbiſhop of Sens had introduced into his dioceſe the cuſtom of proving by the euchariſt perſons accuſed as guilty of any crime. The king wrote to him in the following ſtrong terms : “ I ſwear (ſays he)'by the ſaith I owe to God, that if you do not put a ſtop to the groſs abuſe complained of, you ſhall be deprived of your prieſthood.” The prelate was forced to comply. He puniſhed, in j022, the Manichéens, canons of Oιleans, by burning them at the ſtake. There are, however, recorded of him ſome leſs ſevere actions, which it is right to mention. A dangerous conſpiracy againſt his perſon and government having been diſcovered, and the authors taken into cuſtody, he ſeized the moment when their judges had met to ſentcnce them to death, to cauſe an elegant iepaſt to be ſerved up to them. Next day they were admitted to the euchariſt. Then Robert told them, that he gave them their pardon, “ becauſe none of thoſe can die whom Jeſiis Chrill came to receive at his table ” One day when he was at prayers in the chapel, he perceived a thief, who had cut off the half of the fringe of his mantle, proceeding to take the remainder ; “ Friend (ſays he with a pleaſant countenance), be content with what you have already taken, the reſt will very well ſerve ſome other.” Robert cultivated, and was a patronizer of the ſciences. There are ſeveral hymns wrote by him, which ſtill continue to be ſung in the church. His reign was happy and tranquil. According to ſome authors, he inſtituted the order of the Star, commonly attributed to king John.</p><p><hi rend="italic">ROBERT of France,</hi>  ſecond ſon of Louis VIII. and brother to St Louis, who erected in his favour Artois into a royal peerage in the year 1 237. It was during this time that the unlucky difference between pope Gregory IX. and the emperor Frederic II. took place. Gregory offered to St Louis the empire for Robert ; but the French nobleſſe, having met to deliberate on this propoſal, were of opinion that he ought to reject it. He gave the pope for anſwer : “ That Count Robert eſteemed himſelf ſufficiently honoured by being the brother of a king, who ſurpaſſed in dignity, in</p><p>ſtrength, in wealth, and in birth, all other monarch<hi rend="sup">1</hi>: in the world.” Robert accompanied St Louis into Egypt, and fought with more bravery than prudence at the battle of Maſſourc, on the 9th of February 12 ;o. In his purſuit of the cowards through a certain ſmall village, he was killed by ſtones, ſticks, and other things which they threw at him from the windows. He was an intrepid prince, but too paſſionate, dogmatical, and quarrelſome.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert</hi>  II. <hi rend="italic">Count of Artois,</hi>  ſon of the preceding, ſurnamed the G ood and the Noble, was at the expedition into Africa in 1270. He drove the rebels from Navarre in 1276. He brought a very powerful aſſiſt-ance to Charles I. king of Naples, of which kingdom he was regent during the captivity of Charles II. He defeated the Arragonians in Sicily in 1289, the Engliſh near Bayonne in 1296, and the Flemi.* at Fumes in 1298. But having in 1302 imprudently attempted to force theſe laſt, when encamped near Courtray, he received no leſs than 30 wounds ; and in that expedition loſt both his honour and his life. He was a brave, but paſſionate and fierce man, and good at nothing but pu-gililtic encounters. Mahaud his .daughter inherited the dukedom of Artois, and gave herſelf in marriage to Otho duke of Burgundy, by whom ſhe had two daughters, Jane wife of Philip the Long, and Blanche wife of Charles the Fair. Iu the mean time Philip, ſon of Robert II. had a ſon,</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robep.t</hi>  III. who diſputed the dukedom of Artois with Mahaud his aunt; but he loſt his fuit by two ſentences given in againſt him in 1302 and 1318. He wiſhed to revive the proceſs in 1329, under Philip of Valois, by means of pretended new titles, which were found to be falſe. Robert was condemned the third time, and baniſhed the kingdom in 133 1. Having found an aſylum with Edward III. king of England, he undertook to declare him king of France ; which proved the cauſe of thoſe long and cruel wars which diſtreſſed that kingdom. Robert was wounded at the ſiege of Vannes in 134.2, and died of his wound in England. John, ſon to Robert, and count of. Eu, was. taken priſoner at the battle of Poitiers in. 1356, and terminated his career in 1387. His ſon Philip If. high conſtable of France, carried on war in Africa and Hungary, and died in 1397, being a. priſoner of the Turks. He had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">Charles,</hi>  who died in 1472, leaving no iſſue.</p><p><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert of Anjou,</hi></hi>ſurnamed the Wiſe, third ſon of Charles the Lame, ſucceeded his father in the kingdom of Naples in 1309, by the protection of the popes, and the will of the people, to the excluſion of Charobert ſon of his eldeſt brother. He aided the Roman pontiffs againſt the emperor Henry VII. and, after the death of that prince, was nominated in 1313 vicar of the empire in Italy, in temporal matters, unleſs a new emperor was elected. This title was given him by Clement V. in virtue of a right which he pretended to have to govern the empire during an interregnum. Robert reigned with glory 33 years, eight months, and died on the 19th of January 1343, aged 64.    “ This</p><p>prince (ſays M. De Montigni) had not thoſe qualities which conſtitute heroes, but he had thoſe which make good kings. He was religious, affable, generous, kind, wiſe, prudent, and a zealous promoter of juſtice.” He was called the <hi rend="italic">Solomon</hi>  of his age.
