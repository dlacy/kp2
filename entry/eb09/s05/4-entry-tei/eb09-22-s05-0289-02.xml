It first sprang into notice from a visit of Queen Caroline in 1804, and, as it is the nearest watering-place to London, it is much frequented by excursionists, especially by the poorer classes. It is clean and well built, and at Cliff Town there are a number of large villas. Opposite Cliff Town there is a public garden called the Shrubbery. The bathing is good, but the tide recedes with great rapidity and for nearly a mile. The pier, which is 1 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> / <hi rend="sub">4</hi> miles in length, and on which there is a tramway, permits the approach of steamers at all tides. The public hall was erected in 1872 at a cost of £3000, and a mechanics’ institution dates from 1881. The Rochford county court is held every alternate month in the public hall. A local board of health was established in 1866. The population of the urban sanitary district (area 3441 acres) in 1871 was 4561, and in 1881 it was 7979.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
