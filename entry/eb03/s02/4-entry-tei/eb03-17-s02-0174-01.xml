one who draws contracts, or whoſe buſineſs it is to place money at intereſt. If a ſcrivener is entruſted with a bond, he may receive the intereſt; and if he fails, the obligee ſhall bear the loſs: and ſo it is if he receive the principal and deliver up the bond; for being entruſted with the ſecurity itſelf, it muſt be preſumed that he is truſted with power to receive intereſt or principal; and the giving up the bond on payment of the money ſhall be a diſcharge thereof. But if a ſcrivener ſhall be entrusted with a mortgage-deed, he hath only authority to receive the intereſt, not the principal; the giving up the deed in this caſe not being ſufficient to reſtore the eſlate, but there muſt be a reconveyance, &amp;c. It is held, where a ſcrivener puts out his client’s money on a bad ſecurity, which upon inquiry might have been eaſily found ſo, yet he cannot in equity be charged to anſwer for the money; for it is</p><p>here ſaid, no one would venture to put out money of another upon a ſecurity, if he were obliged to warrant and make it good in caſe a loſs ſhould happen, without any fraud in him.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
