Indeed this is immediately deducible from the ſirſt principles ; for what Mr Buat calls the <hi rend="italic">dragged fluid</hi>  is in fact a cer-tain portion of the whole change of motion produced in the direction of the bodies motion.</p><p>It was found, that with reſpect to thin planes, ſpheres, and pyramidal bodies of equal bafis, the reſiſtances were inverfily as the quantities of fluid dragged along.</p><p>The inte∏igent reader will readily obferve, that theſe views of the Chevalier Buat are not ſo much diſcoveries of new principles as they are claſſiſications of conſe-quences, which may all be deduced from the general prin-¢iples employed by D’Alembert and other mathemati-cians. But they greatly aſſiſt us in forming notions of different parts of the procedure of nature in the mutual action of fluids and ſolids on each other. This rauſt be very acceptable in a ſubject which it is by no means probable that we ſhall be able to inveftigate with mathematical preciſion. we have given an account of theſe laſt obſervations, that we may omit nothing of confiquence that has been written on the ſubject ; and we take this opportunity of recommending the <hi rend="italic">Hydraulique</hi>  of Mr Buat as a moſt ingenious work, containing more original, ingenious, and practically uſeful thoughts, than all the performances we have met with. His doctrine of <hi rend="italic">the principle of uniform motion oſ βuids in pipes and open canals,</hi>  will be of immenſe fervice to all engi-F,eers, and enable them to determine with ſuſſicient preciſion the moft important queſtions in their profeſſion ; queſtions which at preſent they are hardly able to gueſs at. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Rivers</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">WATER Works.</hi></p><p>The only circumſtance which we have not noticed in detail, is the change of reſiſtance produced by the void, or tendency to a, void, which obtains behind the body ; and we omitted a particular difcuſſion, merely becauie we could ſay nothing ſuſſiciently preciſe on the ſubject. Perfons not accuſtomed to the difiuſſions in the phyſico-mathematical ſciences, are apt to entertain doubts or falfi notions connected with this circumſtance, which we ſhall attempt to remove ; and with this we ſhall conclude this long and unſatisfactory differtation.</p><p>If a fluid were perfectly incoropreſſible, and were contained in a vefftl incapable of extenſion, it is impoſſible that any void could be formed behind the body; and in this caſe it is not very eaſy to fie how motion could be performed in it. A ſphere moved in ſuch a medium could not advance the ſmalleſt diſtance, unleſs <hi rend="italic">fame</hi>  particles of the fluid, in filling up the fpace left ⅜y it, moved with a velocity next to infinite. Some</p><lb/><p>degree oſ compreffibility, however ſmall, ſcems neceſlary. If this be inſenſible, it may be rigidly demonſtrated, that an external force of compreſſion will make no <hi rend="italic">ſenfible</hi>  change in the internal motions, or in the reſiſtances. <hi rend="sup">r</hi>Γhis indeed is not obvious, but is an immediate conſequence of the<hi rend="italic">quaquaverpum</hi>  preffure of fluids. As much as the preſſiire <hi rend="italic">is</hi>  augmented by the externaI compreſſions on one ſide of a body, fo much is <hi rend="italic">it</hi>  augmented on the other ſide ; and the fame muſt be faid of every particle. Nothing more is neceffary for ficuring the ſame motions by the ſame partial and internal forces; and this is fully verified by experiment, water re-mains equally fluid under any compreffion3. In ſome of Sir Iſaac Newton’s experiments balls of four inches diameter were made ſo light as to preponderate in wa-ter only three grains. '1 heſe balls defcended in the ſame manner as they would have defcended in a fluid where the reſiſtance was equal in every part ; yet, when they were near the bottom of a veſtel nine feet deep, the compreſſion round them was at laſt 2400 times the moving force ; whereas, when near the top of the veffel, it was not above 50 or 60 times.</p><p>But in a fluid ſenſibly compreſſible, or which is not confined, a void may be left behind the body. Its motion may be ſo ſwift that the ſurrounding preffure may not ſuffice for filling up the deſerted ſpace ; and, in this caſe, a ſtatical preffure will be added to the reſiſtance. This may be the caſe in a veffel or pond of water having an open ſurface expofed to the finite or limited preffure of the atmoſphere. The queftion now is, whe-ther the reſiftance will be increafid by an increaſe of external preffure ? Suppoſing a ſphere moving near the ſurface oſ water, and another moving equally faſt at four times the depth. If the motion be ſo ſwift that a void is formed in both caſes, there is no doubt but that the ſphere which moves at the greateſt depth is moſt reſiſted by the preffure of the water. If there is no void in either cafi, then, becauſe the quadruple depth would cauſe the water to flow in with only a double velocity, it would ſeem that the reſiftance would be greater ; and indeed the water flowing in laterally with a double velocity produces a quadruple non-preffure.— But, on the other hand, the preffure at a ſmall depth may be inſufficient for preventing a void, while that below effectually prevents it ; and this was obfirved in ſome experiments of Chevalier de Borda. The effect, therefore, of greater immeriion, or of greater compreſſion, in an elaſtic fluid, does not follow a preciſe ratio oſ the preffure, but depends partly on abſolute quantities. It cannot, therefore, be ftated by any very ſimple formula what increaſe or diminution of reſiſtance will reſult from a greater depth ; and it is chiefly on this account that experiments made with models of ſhips and mills are not concluſive with reſpect to the performance of a large machine of the ſame proportions, without corrections, ſometimes pretty intricate, we affert, however, with great confidence, that this is of all methods the moſt exact, and infinitely more certain than any thing that can be deduced from the moſt elaborate calculation from theory. If the reſiſtances at all depths be equal, the proportionality of the total reſiſtance to the body is exact, and perfectly conformable to obfirvation&lt;,</p><p>It is only in great velocities where the depth has any material influence, and the influence is not near ſo con-ſiderable as we ſhould, at ſirſt light, ſuppofi ; for, in eſtimating the effect oi immerſion, which has a relation</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
