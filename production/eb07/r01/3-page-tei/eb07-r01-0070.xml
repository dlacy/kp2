It is estimated that vessels can be built at Rangoon for one third less than at Bombay. This capital of the Burmese empire is the resort of traders from all nations ; and it is also an -asylum for less respectable characters, such as insolvent debtors from different settlements of India, foreigners of desperate fortunes, who are received in the most friendly manner by the Burmans, and generally support themselves by some petty traffic. Malabars, Moguls, Persians, Parsees, Armenians, Portuguese, French, and English, men of all countries and of all complexions, are here seen mingled together on the exchange ; and all meet with the most perfect toleration for their religion, provided they do not meddle with the worship of the Burmese divinity, Guadma, or with the ceremonies of any other sect. A considerable portion of the inhabitants are Chinese, who are merchants, shopkeepers, artisans, and constitute the most industrious portion of the community. A share of the trade is also engrossed by the Parsees, Armenians, and a small portion of the Mahommedans, who ∙are also selected by government to fill offices of trust that relate to the trade and the transactions of foreigners.</p><p>The imports from the British settlements consist chiefly of coarse piece-goods, glass, hardware, and broad cloth. The returns are chiefly made in timber, with which Madras is mostly supplied from Rangoon. The trade is carried on in boats, about ten or twelve of which are annually fitted out, and about thirty more from various towns on the Irrawaddy river. These proceed by the way of the Bassein river, through the channels which divide the great Negrais from the continent, along the coast of Arracan, to Luckipore, Dacca, Calcutta, Bogwandola, and even to Patna and Benares. They caιτy each a crew of from twenty to twenty-five men ; and on an average 4000 rupees in bullion, the remainder of the cargo consisting of sheathing boards, sticks of copper from China, Sticklac, cutch, ivory, and wax.</p><p>The inhabitants are stout and athletic, the men being about five feet eight inches in height, with straight muscular limbs; the women rather diminutive, but well formed in every respect, except the nose, which is flat. Both sexes are of a copper colour ; they are lively and inquisitive ; almost all of them read and write, and have no prejudices that obstruct the progress of improvement. The women are not immured at home like those of Hindustan, but superintend the domestic economy, and weave the clothes worn by the men. Their own dress is scanty, and scarcely affords them a decent covering. They are not strict in their morals ; and the men are in the practice of selling their wives and their daughters. The population is estimated at 30,000 ; but Crawford, on a census which he directed to be made whilst in the country, states it at 181,000. Long. 96. 9. E. Lat. 16. 47.
