                in power and privileges. This destructive proposal was at the time successfully
                resisted by the more clearsighted patricians ; but now, when Rome was in ruins,
                the&nbsp;people few and dispirited, and Veii in a flourishing condition, its
                buildings better than even those of Rome had been,&nbsp;the proposal to quit the
                scene of devastation, and remove to&nbsp;one of comfort, was renewed and listened to
                with eagerness.&nbsp;It required all the authority of Camillus, enforced by that
                of&nbsp;the senate, and strengthened by every kind of assistance
                and&nbsp;encouragement that could be devised, to induce the Romans&nbsp;to remain,
                and undertake the heavy and almost hopeless task&nbsp;of rebuilding the ruined city
                of their fathers.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Livy informs us, that while the senate were sitting in grave and
                final deliberation respecting the removal to Veii, or the&nbsp;rebuilding of Rome,
                the people at the same time standing&nbsp;in clusters about the forum eagerly
                debating the same subject, some cohorts, returning from relieving guards, chanced to
                pass through the forum, when a centurion in the comitium called aloud, “
                standard-bearer, plant your standard ;&nbsp;here we shall best remain.” The
                well-omened expression&nbsp;was seized upon by the senate, they rushed out,
                exclaiming&nbsp;with one voice, that “ they accepted the omen ;” the surrounding
                commons applauded and re-echoed the cry; and&nbsp;all, with one voice and one mind,
                agreed to abide by the&nbsp;will of the gods thus indicated, to raise from prostrate
                ruin,&nbsp;and maintain the destinies of their everlasting city. There&nbsp;is
                little doubt that Camillus planned this fortunate omen,&nbsp;and by his
                well-directed efforts in this point, not less than&nbsp;in war, gained the glorious
                designation of a new Romulus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"

                class="font2">RθME.&nbsp;Hitherto we have been led to trace the growth of
                Rome</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">from the building of the thousand Romulean huts on the Palatine, till
                under the Etruscan dynasty of its kings it&nbsp;had extended its power in all
                directions, entered into treaties with transmarine nations, and raised at home
                structures&nbsp;of great magnitude and imperishable durability. We have&nbsp;seen it
                sink into comparative feebleness during the intestine wars by which it was tom
                immediately after the expulsion of its tyrant monarch ; yet even then have we also
                seen&nbsp;noble proofs of that love of liberty, that strength of
                stern&nbsp;indomitable will, that irrepressible perseverance, and that&nbsp;lofty
                confidence in their own destinies, which conspired&nbsp;to render the proud citizens
                of Rome the conquerors of&nbsp;the world. Of even more importance is it to trace
                the&nbsp;growth of constitutional law, as it arose out of the struggles of&nbsp;one
                party which wished to engross and retain all civic rights&nbsp;and privileges, and
                the growing wealth, intelligence, and&nbsp;power of another, which gradually became
                more and more&nbsp;sensible of its rights, and more and more determined to obtain
                them. Even the most careless observerof these contests,&nbsp;and their fluctuations
                of success and disappointment, must&nbsp;have marked, that whatever either party
                gained by unconstitutional violence, was never to either </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">permanent gain ;&nbsp;that
                any premature advance of popular liberty was almost&nbsp;instantly followed by a
                recoil, proving, that not the soundness of a principle, nor the truth and accuracy
                of a theory,&nbsp;but the substantial, the felt, the practical necessity of
                the&nbsp;measure, is the only sure foundation of any addition to, or&nbsp;change in,
                the institutions of a country ; and that the natural and spontaneous adjustment of
                existing rights and institutions, which takes place wherever they are pervaded
                by&nbsp;the genial influence of a healthful vitality, is productive of&nbsp;a far
                greater and more lasting amount of true liberty, public and private, and of all that
                can promote real national welfare, than could ever be obtained or secured by those
                impetuously philanthropic legislators, who dream of creating&nbsp;a commonwealth in
                a day, as a magician would produce a&nbsp;palace by the utterance of some
                all-powerful spell.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">To trace the growth of constitutional law as accurately as possible,
                we must revert to the earliest period of Rome, and endeavour to extricate from their
                fabulous en-velopements the historical truths contained in what are
                now&nbsp;admitted to be poetic legends. By this process we may hope&nbsp;to obtain
                as rational and intelligible a view of the city, the&nbsp;people, and the
                constitution of Rome, as the preceding narrative is capable of affording. It has
                already been stated, that&nbsp;the various inhabitants of that district of Italy, in
                which Rome&nbsp;was built, were the Oscan, Pelasgian, and Etruscan. The Pelasgi
                appear to have settled chiefly along the coast of Italy,&nbsp;from which they drove
                back the original inhabitants, who were&nbsp;probably Oscans. In process of time the
                Oscans descended&nbsp;again in great force from the mountains, overpowered
                the&nbsp;Pelasgians, and reduced them to a species of servitude, allowing them
                however to remain as tillers of the land, and artificers. From this intermixture
                arose the people subsequently known by the name of Latins ; combining the hardy
                and&nbsp;warlike habits of the Oscan mountaineers with the superior&nbsp;skill and
                civilization of the Pelasgi. This view may be regarded as confirmed by the fact,
                first pointed out by Niebuhr,&nbsp;that the words which relate to agriculture and
                the comparatively refined arts of life, in the Latin language, are
                closely&nbsp;allied to the same words in Greek, indicating the Pelasgian&nbsp;origin
                of both ; while the Latin words pertaining to war and&nbsp;the chase are entirely
                alien from the Greek, and are in short&nbsp;of Oscan origin.@@<sup>1</sup> From this
                it may be inferred, that during the formation of the Latin language, the nation was
                composed of two races, the Oscan and the Pelasgian, of whom&nbsp;the Oscan held the
                chief sway. The two races being both&nbsp;accustomed to the simple patriarchal, or
                family form of rule,&nbsp;would have a natural tendency to blend together so as
                speedily to become one people. This seems to have been tlle condition in which they
                were, during tlle period when Rome is&nbsp;said to have been built.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Whether the traditionary founder of Rome was of Oscan or Pelasgian
                race, cannot be ascertained. The greater part&nbsp;of his followers appear to have
                been Pelasgian ; and from&nbsp;them the settlement may have obtained its name, which
                was&nbsp;afterwards given to the legendary hero himself. One of
                the&nbsp;traditionary accounts of Romulus, represents him as having&nbsp;been sent
                in his youth to an Etruscan city, for the purpose&nbsp;of receiving instruction
                superior to what could be obtained&nbsp;in Latium. Were we receiving the narrative
                as that respecting a real person, we should ascribe to his Etrurian&nbsp;education
                the attention paid by Romulus to augury, and the&nbsp;other arts of divination, in
                which the Etruscans are known&nbsp;to have excelled. The tradition may however refer
                to some&nbsp;influential Etruscan leader, who may have joined the
                early&nbsp;founders of Rome, and contributed greatly to mould their&nbsp;religious
                institutions. This view is supported by the statement of some authors, that an
                Etruscan chief, named Lucumo, was an early ally of Romulus, and aided him in
                the&nbsp;Sabine war, in which he was killed. The term Lucumo,&nbsp;we know, was not
                a personal name, but one of rank and office common to the Etruscan chiefs, who were
                all Lucumones. This Lucumo may have been the Tuscan chief&nbsp;Caeles Vibenna, who
                is said to have settled on the Caelian&nbsp;hill, to which he gave his
                    name.@@<sup>2</sup> If this be admitted, and&nbsp;we suppose the followers of
                this Etruscan Lucumo removed&nbsp;to Rome by the Roman founder, after the fall of
                their own&nbsp;chief, we have a very probable account of the origin of
                the&nbsp;third tribe of the Roman people, the Luceres, who, though&nbsp;admitted as
                an original tribe, were in some respects subordinate to the other two, the Ramnenses
                and Titienses, or&nbsp;Romans and Sabines. The Luceres may have been 01&nbsp;a more
                mixed race than the other two tribes, and on that&nbsp;account somewhat less
                esteemed. It is indeed by no means&nbsp;improbable that the first inhabitants of
                Rome were compos</span></p><div>
