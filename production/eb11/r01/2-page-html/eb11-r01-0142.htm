<p><span class="font1">in S. Maria della Pace,—figures of exquisite grace, arranged with perfect skill in an awkward space. It is not without&nbsp;reason that Vasari&nbsp;gives these the&nbsp;highest position&nbsp;among his fresco-paintings.@@1 Agostino Chigi also&nbsp;employed Raphael&nbsp;to build for him&nbsp;a private chapel&nbsp;in S. Maria del&nbsp;Popolo, and to&nbsp;make a series of&nbsp;cartoons to be exe&nbsp;cuted in mosaic&nbsp;on the inner dome.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>The central medallion has a figure of&nbsp;God among clouds&nbsp;and angel boys,&nbsp;such as Raphael&nbsp;drew with unrivalled grace (fig.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">6), and around are the eight planets, each with its pagan deity and directing angel.@@<sup>3</sup> He has not hampered himself&nbsp;by any of the usual rules which should apply to the designing of mosaic; they are simply treated as pictures, with almost&nbsp;deceptive effects of perspective. The execution of these&nbsp;brilliant mosaics was carried out by the Venetian Luigi della&nbsp;Pace, whose signature is introduced on the torch of Cupid in&nbsp;the panel representing the star Venus (Ludovico&nbsp;della Pace Veneziano fecit, 1516). These&nbsp;mosaics are still as perfect and brilliant as if they&nbsp;were the work of yesterday. Probably in the early&nbsp;years of Leo X.'s reign were painted the Madonna della Seggiola (Pitti), the S. Cecilia at Bologna (not completed till 1516),&nbsp;the miniature Vision of Ezekiel (Pitti) and three important&nbsp;pictures at Madrid. The latest of these, known as Lo Spasimo,&nbsp;from the church at Palermo, for which it was painted, is one&nbsp;of Raphael’s finest compositions, representing Christ bearing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His Cross. It bears signs of Giulio Romano’s hand in its heavy colouring with unpleasant purple tones. The Madonna called&nbsp;Della Perla has much changed from the darkening of the pigments; in design it recalls Leonardo da Vinci.@@<sup>4</sup> The small&nbsp;Madonna della Rosa is the most perfect in colour of all the&nbsp;master’s pictures in the Madrid Gallery, and is usually rather&nbsp;undervalued; it is a most graceful little picture. The portrait&nbsp;of Leo X. with Cardinals de’ Rossi and de’ Medici, in the Pitti,&nbsp;is one of his finest portrait-pictures, especially as regards the&nbsp;figure of the pope.@@5 Little is known about the Madonna di&nbsp;S. Sisto, the glory of the Dresden Gallery; no studies or sketches&nbsp;for it exist. In style it much resembles the Madonna di Foligno;&nbsp;it is less injured by restoration than the latter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among the latest works of Raphael are the large “ St Michael and the Devil,” in the Louvre, signed “ Raphael Urbinas pinge-bat, mdxviii.,” and the very beautiful portrait of the Vioh'n-player, in the Sciarra-Colonna Palace in Rome, also dated&nbsp;1518; this last bears much resemblance to the painter himself.&nbsp;The British Museum possesses one of Raphael’s finest portraits,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">though only a chalk drawing, that of his friend the painter Timoteo della Vite, a masterpiece of expression and vigour;&nbsp;it is executed in black and red, and is but little inferior in&nbsp;chromatic effect to an oil-painting; it is life size, and is exe-cuted with wonderful skill and evident keen interest in the&nbsp;subject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The tapestry cartoons, seven of which are in the Victoria and Albert Museum, were painted by pupils from Raphael’s&nbsp;designs. They are part of a set of ten, with scenes from the&nbsp;Acts of the Apostles, intended, when copied in tapestry, to&nbsp;adorn the lower part of the walls of the Sistine chapel. The&nbsp;tapestries themselves, worked at Brussels, are now, after&nbsp;many vicissitudes, ħung in a gallery in the Vatican; the set&nbsp;is complete, thus preserving the design of the three lost cartoons.&nbsp;The existing seven, after being cut up into strips for use&nbsp;on the looms, were bought by Rubens for Charles I.@@6 The&nbsp;tapestry copies are executed with wonderful skill, in spite of&nbsp;Raphael’s having treated the subjects in a purely pictorial&nbsp;way, with little regard to the exigencies of textile work. The&nbsp;designs are reversed, and the colours far more brilliant than&nbsp;those of the cartoons, much gold and silver being introduced.&nbsp;The noble figure of Christ in the Delivery of the Keys to St&nbsp;Peter is in the tapestry much disfigured by the addition of a&nbsp;number of large gold stars all over the drapery, which spoil&nbsp;the simple dignity of the folds. The rich framework round&nbsp;each picture, designed by Raphael’s pupils, probably by Penni&nbsp;and Giovanni da Udine, exists in the tapestries and adds greatly&nbsp;to their decorative effect. The cartoons were executed in&nbsp;1515 and 1516, and the finished tapestries were first exhibited&nbsp;in their place in the Sistine chapel on the 26th of December&nbsp;1519—a very short time for the weaving of such large and&nbsp;elaborate pictures. The three of which the cartoons are lost&nbsp;represent the Martyrdom of St Stephen, the Conversion of&nbsp;St Paul, and St Paul in Prison at Philippi. Probably no&nbsp;pictures are better known to have been more often engraved&nbsp;and copied than these seven cartoons.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Transfiguration</span><span class="font1">.@@<sup>8</sup>—In 1519 Cardinal Giuliano de' Medici (afterwards Clement VII.), as bishop of Narbonne, ordered&nbsp;two altar-pieces for his cathedral—the one by Raphael, the&nbsp;other by Raphael’s Venetian rival Sebastiano del Piombo.&nbsp;That by the latter painter is the noble Resurrection of Lazarus,&nbsp;now in the National Gallery, in the drawing of which the&nbsp;Venetian received important aid from Michelangelo. Several&nbsp;studies for Raphael’s picture exist, showing that he at first&nbsp;intended to paint a Resurrection of Christ as a pendant to&nbsp;Sebastiano’s subject, but soon altered his scheme into the&nbsp;Transfiguration. The eight or nine existing studies are scattered through the Oxford, Lille, Windsor and some private&nbsp;collections. A great part of the lower group was unfinished&nbsp;at the time of the painter’s sudden death in 1520, and a good&nbsp;deal of the heavy colouring of Giulio Romano is visible in&nbsp;it. On the death of Raphael the picture became too precious&nbsp;to send out of Rome, and Cardinal de’ Medici contented himself&nbsp;with sending the Resurrection of Lazarus to Narbonne. The&nbsp;Transfiguration was bequeathed by him to the monks of&nbsp;S. Pietro in Montorio, in whose church it remained till it was&nbsp;stolen by Napoleon I. It now hangs in the Vatican Gallery.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@5</sup>The magnificent portrait-heads of the Venetian scholars Navagero and Beazzano, now in the Doria Gallery in Rome, are worthy of Raphael at his best, and have for long been attributed to him.&nbsp;There are good contemporary copies at Madrid.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
