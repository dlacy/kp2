<p><span class="font0">uſually form, as has been already obferved under this article, the baſis of civil order. Religious opinions&nbsp;may lead the great body of the community to reverence ſome particular fet of inſtitutions, ſome individual, or ſome family, which are repreſented to them as&nbsp;peculiarly connected with the gods whom they adore.&nbsp;Under this ſanction ſome form ©f government is eſta-hliſhed ; they are taught to perform ſocial duties, and&nbsp;rendered capable of ſocial enjoyments. Not only Numa and Lycurgus, but almoſi every legiſlator who has&nbsp;fought to civilize a rude people, and reduce them under the reſtraints of legal government, have endeavoured to impreſs their people with an idea that they acted&nbsp;with the approbation, and under the immediate direction, of ſuperior powers, we cannot but allow that&nbsp;the rude ſuperſtitions of early ages are productive of&nbsp;theſe advantages to ſociety ; but we have already acknowledged, and it cannot be denied, that they are al-ſo attended with many unhappy effects, when we&nbsp;view the abſurdities intermixed with thc ſyſtems of religion which prevailed among moſt of the nations of&nbsp;antiquity, we cannot help lamenting that ſo noble a&nbsp;principle of human nature as our religious ſentiments&nbsp;ihould be liable to ſuch groſs perverfιon ; and when we&nbsp;view the effects which they produce on the morals of&nbsp;mankind, and the forms of ſociety, though we allow&nbsp;them to have been upon the whole rather beneficial than&nbsp;hurtful, yet we cannot but obſerve, that their unfavourable effects are by far more numerous than if they had&nbsp;been better directed, what unhappy effects, for inſtance,·&nbsp;have been produced by falſe notions concerning the&nbsp;condition of human ſouls in a future Rate, various nations have imagined that the ſcenes and objects of the&nbsp;world of ſpirits are only a ſhadow; repreſentation of&nbsp;the things of the prefent world. Not only the fouls&nbsp;of men, according to them, inhabit thoſe regions ; all&nbsp;the inferior animals and vegetables, and even inanimate&nbsp;bodies that are killed or deſtroyed here, are ſuppofed&nbsp;to paſs into that vifionary world ; and, exiſting there&nbsp;in unſubftantial forms, to execute the ſame functions,&nbsp;or feιve the ſame purpoſes, as on earth. Such are the&nbsp;ideas of futurity that were entertained by the inhabitants of Guinea. And by thefe ideas they were induced, when a king or great man died among them, to&nbsp;provide for his comfortable accommodation in the world&nbsp;• of ſpirits, by burying with him meat and drink ſor his&nbsp;fubſiſtence, ſtaves to attend and ſerve him, and wives&nbsp;with whom he might ſtill enjoy the pltaſures of love.&nbsp;His faithful ſubjects vied with each other in offering,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">one a ſervant, another a wife, a third a ſon or daughter, to be ſent to the other world in company with the monarch, that they might there be employed in his&nbsp;'ſervice. In New Spain, in the iſland cf Java, in the&nbsp;kingdom of Benen, and among the inhabitants of </span><span class="font1">Is-</span><span class="font0">doſtan, ſimilar practices on the ſame occaſion, owing no&nbsp;doubt to ſimilar notions of futurity, have been prevalent. But fuch practices as theſe cannot be viewed&nbsp;with greater contempt on account of the opinions&nbsp;■which have given riſe to them, than horror on account&nbsp;of their unhappy effects on the condition of thole&nbsp;among whom they prevail. A lively impreffion of the&nbsp;cnjoyments to be obtained in a future ftate, together&nbsp;with fome very ſalfe or incorrect notions concerning&nbsp;the qualities or actions which were to entitle the departing ſoul </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to admiſſion into the ſcene of thoſe enjoy</span><span class="font0">ments, is ſaid to have produced equally ùnhappÿ effects among the Japaneſe. They not only bribed their&nbsp;prieſts to ſolicit for them ; but looking upon the enjoyments of the preſent life with diſguſt or contempt, they&nbsp;uſed to daſh themſelves from precipices, or cut their&nbsp;throats, in order to get to paradſſe as ſoon as poffible.&nbsp;Various other ſuperſtitions ſubſiſting among rude πa-tions might here be enumerated, as inſtances of the&nbsp;perverſion of the religious principles of the human&nbsp;heart, which render them injurious to virtue and happinefs. The auſterities which have been practiſed,&nbsp;chiefly among rude nations, as means of propitiating&nbsp;ſuperior powers, are eſpecially worthy of notice.—&nbsp;when the favourite idol of the Banians is carried </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">folemn proceſſion, fome devotees proſtrate themfelve‰&nbsp;on the ground, that the chariot in which the idol is&nbsp;carried may run over them ; others, with equal enthu-ſtaſm, daſh themſelves on ſpikes faſtened on purpoſe </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the car. Innumerable are tbe ways of torture which&nbsp;have been invented and practiſed on themielves by men&nbsp;ignorantly ſtriving to recommend themſelves to the favour of heaven. Theſe we lament as inſtances in which&nbsp;religious ſentiments have been ſo ill directed by the in-ſluence of imagination, and unenlightened erring reaſon, as to produce unfavourable effects on the human&nbsp;character, and oppofe the happineſs of ſocial life.·—&nbsp;Though we have argued, that even the moſt abſurd </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fy~&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ſtems of religion that have prevailed in the world, have&nbsp;been upon the whole rather beneficial than injurious t¢f&nbsp;the dignity and happineſs of human nature ; yet if it&nbsp;ſtiall not appear, as we proceed farther in our comparative view of the effects of religion on ſociety, that others&nbsp;have been attended with happier effects than theie ſuperſtitions which belong to the rude ages of ſociety,&nbsp;we may ſcarce venture to brand the infidel with the ap-peliation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fool,</span><span class="font0"> for refuſing to give his affent to religious doctrines, or to act under their influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2d, The polytheſſm of the Greeks and Romans,, and cither heathen nations in a ſimilar ſtate oſ civilization, we have already conſidered as being, upon the&nbsp;whole, rather favourable than unfavourable to virtue;&nbsp;but we muſt not partially conceal its defects. The vicious characters of the deities which they worſhipped,&nbsp;the incorrect notions which they entertained concerning&nbsp;the moral government cf the univerſſe and a future </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">re-</span><span class="font0">tribution, the abſurdity of their rites and ceremonies,,&nbsp;and the criminal practices which were intermixed with&nbsp;them, muſt have altogether had a tendency to pervert&nbsp;both the reaſoning and the moral principles of the human mind. The debaucheries of the monarch of the&nbsp;gods, and the fdelity with which his example in that&nbsp;reſpect was followed by the whole crowd of the inferior&nbsp;deities, did, we know, diſpoſe the devout heathen, when&nbsp;he felt the ſame paſſions which had afferted thejr power&nbsp;over the gods, to gratify them without ſcruple. It is&nbsp;a truth, however, and we will not attempt to deny or&nbsp;conceal it, that tire genius of the polytheiſm of the&nbsp;Greeks and Romans was friendly to the arts ; to ſuch&nbsp;of them eſpecially as are raifed to excellence by the vi-goιous exertion of a fine imagination; muſic, poetry,&nbsp;ſeulpture, architecture, and pa ntmg, all of theſe arts&nbsp;appear to have been confiderably indebted for that perfection to whic∩ they attained, elpecially among the.&nbsp;Greeks, to the fplendid and fanciful ſyſtem of mytholo-gy. which </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">was received </span><span class="font0">among, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">that ingenious people. —</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
