<p><span class="font0">society and persons with inexhaustible fancy, wit, eloquence and freedom, until he was attacked with a violent brain malady&nbsp;in the spring of 1878 (ad, 59); and, although he recovered in a&nbsp;few months sufficiently to do some occasional work, he resigned&nbsp;his professorship early in 1879. The next three years he spent&nbsp;at Brantwood, mainly in retirement, and unhappy in finding&nbsp;nearly all his labours interrupted by his broken health. In&nbsp;1880 he was able to travel in northern France, and began&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bible of Amiens,</span><span class="font0"> finished in 1885; and he issued occasional&nbsp;numbers of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fors,</span><span class="font0"> the last of which appeared at Christmas 1884.&nbsp;In 1882 he had another serious illness, with inflammation of&nbsp;the brain; but he recovered sufficiently to travel to his old&nbsp;haunts in France and Italy—his last visit. And in the following&nbsp;year he w<sup>T</sup>as re-elected professor at Oxford and resumed his&nbsp;lectures; but increasing brain excitement, and indignation at&nbsp;the establishment of a laboratory to which vivisection was&nbsp;admitted, led him to resign his Oxford career, and he retired&nbsp;in 1884 to Brantwood, which he never left. He now suffered&nbsp;from frequent attacks of brain irritation and exhaustion,&nbsp;and had many causes of sorrow and disappointment. His&nbsp;lectures were published at intervals from 1870 to 1885 in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aratra&nbsp;Pentelici, The Eagle's Nest, Lore's Meime, Ariadne Florentina,&nbsp;Val d'Arno, Proserpina, Deucalion, The Laws of FcsoU, The&nbsp;Bible of Amiens, The Art of England</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Pleasures of&nbsp;England,</span><span class="font0"> together with a series of pamphlets, letters, articles,&nbsp;notes, catalogues and circulars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the retirement of Brantwood he began his last work, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Praeterita,</span><span class="font0"> a desultory autobiography with personal anecdotes&nbsp;and reminiscences. He was again attacked with the same&nbsp;mental malady in 1885, which henceforth left him fit only for&nbsp;occasional letters and notes. In 1887 it was found that he had&nbsp;exhausted (spent, and given away) the whole of the fortune&nbsp;he had received from his father, amounting, it is said, to something like £200,000; and he was dependent on the vast and&nbsp;increasing sale of his works, which produced an average income&nbsp;of £4000 a year, and at times on the sale of his pictures and&nbsp;realizable property. In 1872 a correspondent had remonstrated&nbsp;with him in vain as to taking “ usury,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> interest on capital&nbsp;lent to others for use. In 1874 Ruskin himself had begun to&nbsp;doubt its lawfulness. In 1876 he fiercely assailed the practice&nbsp;of receiving interest or rent, and he henceforth lived on his&nbsp;capital, which he gave freely to friends, dependants, public&nbsp;societies, charitable and social objects. The course of his&nbsp;opinions and his practice is fully explained in successive letters&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fors.</span><span class="font0"> Until 1889 he continued to write chapters of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Praeterita,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which was designed to record memories of his life down to the&nbsp;year 1875 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aet.</span><span class="font0"> 56). It was, in fact, only completed in regular&nbsp;series down to 1858 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aet.</span><span class="font0"> 39), with a separate chapter as to Mrs&nbsp;Arthur Severn, and a fragment called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dilecta,</span><span class="font0"> containing letters&nbsp;and early recollections of friends, especially of Turner. These&nbsp;two books were published between 1885 and 1889; and except&nbsp;for occasional letters, notes and prefaces, they form the last&nbsp;writings of the author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Modern Painters.</span><span class="font0"> His literary career&nbsp;thus extends over fifty years. But he has left nothing more&nbsp;graceful, naive and pathetic than his early memories in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Praeterita&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">—a book which must rank with the most famous “ Confessions ”&nbsp;in any literature. The last ten years of his life were passed&nbsp;in complete retirement at Brantwood, in the loving care of&nbsp;the Severn family, to whom the estate was transferred, with&nbsp;occasional visits from friends, but with no sustained work&nbsp;beyond correspondence, the revision of his works, and a few&nbsp;notes and prefatory words to the books of others. He wished&nbsp;to withdraw his early art writings from circulation, but the&nbsp;public demand made this practically impossible. And now the&nbsp;whole of his writings are under the control of Mr George Allen,&nbsp;in several forms and prices, including a cheap series at 5s. per&nbsp;volume.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The close of his life was one of entire peace and honour. He was loaded with the degrees of the universities and membership&nbsp;of numerous societies and academies. <sup>u</sup> Ruskin Societies ”&nbsp;were founded in many parts of the kingdom. His works were&nbsp;translated and read abroad, and had an enormous circulation&nbsp;in Great Britain and the United States. Many volumes about&nbsp;his career and opinions were issued in his lifetime both at home&nbsp;and abroad. His 80th birthday, 8th February 1899, was&nbsp;celebrated by a burst of congratulations and addresses, both&nbsp;public and private. His strength failed gradually: his mind&nbsp;remained feeble but unclouded, and his spirit serene. An&nbsp;attack of influenza struck him down, and carried him off&nbsp;suddenly after only two days’ illness, 20th January 1900. He&nbsp;was buried in Coniston churchyard by his own express wish,&nbsp;the family refusing the offer of a grave in Westminster Abbey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruskin’s literary life may be arranged In three divisions. From 1837 to i860 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aet.</span><span class="font0"> 18 to 41) he was occupied mainly with the arts.&nbsp;From i860 to 1871 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aet.</span><span class="font0"> 41 to 52) he was principally occupied with&nbsp;social problems. From 1871 to 1885 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aet.</span><span class="font0"> 52 to 66) he was again&nbsp;drawn back largely to art by his lectures as professor, whilst prosecuting his social Utopia by speech, pen, example and purse.&nbsp;But the essential break in his life was in i860, which marks the&nbsp;close of his main works on art and the opening of his attempt&nbsp;to found a new. social gospel. With regard to his views of art,&nbsp;he. himself modified and revised them from time to time; and&nbsp;it is admitted that some of his judgments are founded on imperfect&nbsp;study and personal bias. But the essence ol his teaching has&nbsp;triumphed, in effect, and has profoundly modified the views of&nbsp;artists, critics and the public, although it is but rarely accepted&nbsp;as complete or final. The moral of his teaching—that all living&nbsp;art requires </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">truth, nature, purity, earnestness</span><span class="font0">—has now become the&nbsp;axiom of all aesthetic work or judgment. John Ruskin founded&nbsp;the Reformation in Art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With regard to his economic and social ideas there is far less general concurrence, though the years that have passed since </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unto&nbsp;this Last</span><span class="font0"> appeared have seen the practical overthrow of the rigid&nbsp;plutonomy which he denounced. So, too, the vague and sentimental socialism which pervades </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Munera Putveris, Time and Tide&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fors</span><span class="font0"> is now very much in the air, and represents the aspirations, of many, energetic reformers. But the 'negative part of&nbsp;Ruskin’s teaching on economics, social and political problems,&nbsp;has been much more effective than the positive part of his teaching.&nbsp;It must be admitted that nearly the whole of his practical expenmen ts to realize his dreams have come to nothing, which is not&nbsp;unnatural, seeing his defiance of the ordinary habits and standards&nbsp;of the world. A more serious defect was his practice of violently&nbsp;assailing philosophers, economists and men of science, of whom&nbsp;he knew almost nothing, and whom he perversely misunderstood:&nbsp;men such as Adam Smith, Comte, Mill, Spencer, Darwin and all&nbsp;who followed them. In. art, Ruskin had enjoyed an unexampled&nbsp;training, which made him a consummate expert. In philosophy&nbsp;and science.he was an amateur, seeking to found a new sociology&nbsp;and a Utopian polity out of his own inner consciousness and study&nbsp;of nature, of poetry and the Bible. It is not wonderful if, in&nbsp;doing this, he poured forth a quantity of crude conceits and some&nbsp;glaring blunders. But in the most Quixotic of his schemes, and&nbsp;the most Laputan of his theories, his pure and chivalrous nature,&nbsp;his marvellous insight into the heart of things and men, and his&nbsp;genius to seize, on all that is true, real and noble in life, made&nbsp;his most startling proposals pregnant with meaning, and even his&nbsp;casual play full of fascination and moral suggestion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In mastery of prose language.he has never been surpassed, when he chose to curb his florid imagination and his discursive eagerness&nbsp;of soul. The beauty and gorgeous.imagery of his art works bore&nbsp;away the public from the first, in spite of their heretical dogmatism&nbsp;and their too frequent extravagance of rhetoric. But his later&nbsp;economic and social pieces, such as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Unto this Last, Time and Tide,&nbsp;Sesame and Lilies,</span><span class="font0"> are composed in the purest and most lucid of&nbsp;English styles. And many of his simply technical and explanatory&nbsp;notes have the same quality. Towards the close of his life, in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fors</span><span class="font0"> and in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Praeterita,</span><span class="font0"> will be found passages of tenderness, charm&nbsp;and subtlety, which have never been surpassed in our language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ruskin’s life and writings have been the subject of many works<sup>0 </sup>composed by friends,, disciples and admirers. The principal is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font0"> by W. G. Collingwood, his friend, neighbour and secretary&nbsp;(1900). His pupil, Mr E. T. Cook, published his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Studies in Ruskin&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in 1890, with full details of his career as professor. Mr J. A. Hobson,&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">John Ruskin, Social Reformer</span><span class="font0"> (2nd ed., 1899), has elaborately&nbsp;discussed his social and economic teaching, and claims him as&nbsp;“the greatest social teacher of his age.” An analysis of his w'orks&nbsp;has been written by Mrs Meyncll (1900). His art theories have&nbsp;been discussed by Professor Charles Waldstein of Cambridge in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Work of John Ruskin</span><span class="font0"> (1804), by Robert de la Sizeranne in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ruskin&nbsp;et la religion de la beauté</span><span class="font0"> (1897), and by Professor H. J. Brunhes of&nbsp;Fribourg in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ruskin et la Bible</span><span class="font0"> (1901). The monumental “ library&nbsp;edition .of Ruskin’s works (begun in 1903), prepared by Mr E. T.&nbsp;Cook, with Mr A. Wedderburn, is the greatest of all the tributes&nbsp;of literary admiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(F. Ha.)</span></p>
