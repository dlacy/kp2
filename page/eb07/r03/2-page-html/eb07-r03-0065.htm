<p><span class="font0">On the Caspian declivity we have, 1. the Volga, the largest river in Europe. It originates in the government of&nbsp;Tver, near the village of Volgo Verkovie, in the forest of&nbsp;Volkouski, in north latitude 57° V 37&quot;. It traverses Lakes&nbsp;Steij, Peno, and Volga, and on receiving the waters of Lake&nbsp;Seligher, it becomes navigable, and falls into the Caspian&nbsp;Sea by eight principal arms, which have in all sixty-five&nbsp;mouths, forming about seventy islands. It has a number of&nbsp;tributaries, the principal of which, on the left, is the Kama,&nbsp;or Little Volga, which has a course of about a thousand miles&nbsp;in length. Before the Volga receives the Kama, the rivers&nbsp;Tverza, Mologa, Ounja, Vetlouga, and others, join it on&nbsp;the left; and on the right the Oka, which descends from&nbsp;the water-shed where the Don and the Dnieper originate.&nbsp;The Soura, which flows from the mountains of Volga, is&nbsp;another large tributary, which joins it on the right. The&nbsp;Volga is nearly two thousand miles in length. Its breadth&nbsp;at Astracan, where it embraces many islands, is nearly five&nbsp;leagues at the greatest height of the water. The depth of&nbsp;its waters varies from seven to eighteen feet. In the winter&nbsp;it is covered with ice throughout its whole extent, but there&nbsp;are always many apertures in the south, from which currents&nbsp;of air escape, and hence they are termed the lungs of the&nbsp;Volga. During summer the Volga is crowded with thousands of boats, constructed in the well-wooded countries of&nbsp;Northern Russia, and bearing down from the interior all kinds&nbsp;of commodities. Their return being difficult, they are generally broken up and sold at Astracan. This noble river is&nbsp;the principal commercial road of the interior of the Russian&nbsp;empire. It encircles the central table-land, receiving, as we&nbsp;have seen, the Oka, the principal river in this fertile region.&nbsp;It communicates in the upper part of its course by the canal&nbsp;ofVichnei-Volotchock, with the Lakes Ladoga and Onega;&nbsp;and, lastly, the Kama conveys to it all the waters of Eastern&nbsp;Russia. “ The town of Astracan,” says Malte-Brun, “ may&nbsp;be supposed an Alexandria on a Scythian Nile, but the river&nbsp;enters an inland sea; it does not communicate with the&nbsp;ocean, and the countries which it waters are inhabited by barbarous nations; still, however, the advantages which human&nbsp;industry may derive from the majestic courses of the Volga and the Danube are not as yet realized.” The term&nbsp;“ barbarous” is' now scarcely merited. 2. The Ural, or&nbsp;Oural, so called in conformity to a decree of Catherine II.&nbsp;It descends from the eastern declivities of the mountains&nbsp;bearing the same name, and flowing in a smooth channel&nbsp;sufficiently deep for small vessels, traces for a considerable&nbsp;distance the eastern and southern frontiers of the government of Orenburg, and the eastern limits of Europe. On&nbsp;the right it receives the Sakmara, on the left the llek, and&nbsp;after a course of above a thousand miles falls into the Caspian near Gouriev. 3. The Terek. This stream rises at&nbsp;the base of the Kazbek; receives on the right the rivers&nbsp;Songa and Aksai, on the left the Ourong, Tcherek, Bekhar,&nbsp;and Malka; and enters the Caspian by three principal&nbsp;mouths, between the Gulfs of Kouma and Agrakhan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the declivity of the Frozen Ocean we have, 1. the Petchora, which rises in the Ural mountain range, and traverses the most solitary deserts of Russia, the governments&nbsp;of Archangel and Vologda. Its steep calcareous banks are&nbsp;broken by caverns and ravines; and hence its name Pet-choran, which in the Russian language signifies caverns.&nbsp;After receiving, amongst other tributaries, the Oussa on&nbsp;the right and the Tyra on the left, it falls into the Arctic&nbsp;Ocean in north latitude 67° 10', its mouths forming an immense estuary. The length of its course is about 670 miles.&nbsp;2. The Mezen, which originates in some bogs in the government of Vologda, and after a course of five or six hundred&nbsp;miles discharges itself into a bay of the same name on the&nbsp;shores of the White Sea, almost under the polar circle. 3.'&nbsp;The Dvina, which name the rivers Soukhona and Joug receive after their junction near Weliki-Oust-Joug. The&nbsp;Soukhona flows from Lake Koubinskoe, in the government&nbsp;of Vologda; it is united with Lake Bielo by means of a canal,&nbsp;and also with the rivers Volga and Neva in the same manner. The Joug rises in the same government, but is a&nbsp;much smaller stream. The Dvina does not assume the dimensions of a large river till after the junction of the Vychegda, which falls into it on the right. The latter is united&nbsp;with the Volga by means of Catherine’s Canal. Near Khol-mogory it divides into several arms, and after a course of&nbsp;above 700 miles falls into a gulf of the same name. Its&nbsp;mouth is greatly obstructed by a bar of mud. 4. The Onega,&nbsp;which is the outlet of several lakes, but not that of Onega,&nbsp;although it be situated in the neighbourhood. There are&nbsp;other rivers which fall into the White Sea and Arctic Ocean,&nbsp;but none of them are of any great moment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The declivity of the Baltic Sea contains a variety of rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Torneo, or Tornea. It originates in Swedish Lap-land, and, after the confluence of its great tributary the&nbsp;Muonio, down to its embouchure in the Baltic Sea, it forms&nbsp;the boundary between Russia and Sweden. The Muonio,&nbsp;likewise, traces for some distance the limit of the empire&nbsp;on this side. The Tornea has a course of about 280 miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Neva, in several respects a remarkable river. “ The&nbsp;Neva,” says Colonel Jackson, @@<sup>1</sup> “ though it be called a river,&nbsp;is more properly a bosphorus or strait. Its length, from&nbsp;Schlusselburg, at the south-west angle of the Ladoga Lake,&nbsp;to its mouth, is sixty-nine versts; its direction that of a&nbsp;straight line from east to west; its medium breadth about&nbsp;1500 feet; and its depth, in many places considerable, is generally in the channel about fifty feet. The water of the&nbsp;Neva is remarkably pure, and though the first use of it by&nbsp;strangers generally produces slight diarrhoea, yet it is very&nbsp;wholesome and extremely palatable. This fine river is the&nbsp;grand and only outlet for the superabundant waters of four&nbsp;great basins, each of which has an extensive natural reservoir of its own. These reservoirs are the Lakes Onega,&nbsp;Ilmen, Salma, and Ladoga; the latter receiving the drains&nbsp;of the other three. Ten different streams flow into the&nbsp;Onega, whose length from north to south is 190 versts,&nbsp;and its breadth from east to west seventy versts. It discharges into the Ladoga by the Sveer, a river 202 versts&nbsp;long, and of very unequal breadth. The Rmen is fifty-five&nbsp;versts long from north-east to south-west, and about thirty&nbsp;wide from north-west to south-east. It receives eleven&nbsp;streams, and has its outlet into the Ladoga by the Volkoff,&nbsp;206 versts long, with a medium breadth of 1400 feet. The&nbsp;Saima, which is rather a collection of lakes, of gulfs, and&nbsp;bays, of all shapes and sizes, communicating with each other,&nbsp;than a regularly-formed and single sheet of water, is estimated by Peter Friccius at 130 versts long in the direction of&nbsp;west-south-west to east-north-east, and 120 from north to&nbsp;south ; but on the Swedish side it is about 280 versts more.&nbsp;It pays its tribute to the Ladoga by means of the Voksha&nbsp;or Voxa, a river about 180 versts long, and not navigable in&nbsp;consequence of its several cascades, of which the most considerable, that of Imatra, has a fall of upwards of thirty-two&nbsp;feet. Besides the Sveer, Volkoff, and the Voxa, the Ladoga receives the waters of thirteen other streams. This,&nbsp;the largest lake of Europe, is about 175 versts long and&nbsp;105 broad, and of an oval form. The surfaces of the four&nbsp;lakes are thus estimated. The Onega, 430 leagues, of 25&nbsp;to a degree; the Ilmen, 36 ; the Sai'ma, 210 ; and the&nbsp;Ladoga, 830 degrees.” At St Petersburg the Neva di-</span></p>
