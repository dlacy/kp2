(Alexander), whoſe adventures gave riſe to a well-known hiſtorical romance, was born at Largo, in the county of Fife, about the year 1676, and was bred a seaman. He went from England, in</p><p>1703, in the capacity of ſailing-maſter of a ſmall vessel called the Cinque-Ports Galley, Charles Pickering captain, burthen about 90 tons, with 16 guns and 63 men ; and in September the ſame year sailed From Corke, in company with another ſhip of 26 guns and 120 men, called the St George, commanded by that famous navigator William Dampier, intending to cruize on the Spaniards in the South Sea. On the coaſt of Brazil, Pickering died, and was ſucceeded in his command by his lieutenant Thomas Stradling. They proceeded on their voyage round Cape Horn to the iſland of Juan Fernandes, whence they were driven by the appearance of two French ſhips of 36 guns each, and left five of Stradling’s men there on ſhore, who were taken off by the French. Hence they sailed to the coaſt of America, where Dampier and Stradling quarrelled, and ſeparated by agreement, on the 19th of May 1704. In September following, Stradling came again to the iſland of Juan Fernandes, where Selkirk and his captain had a difference, which, with the circumſtance of the ſhip's being very leaky, and in bad condition, induced him to determine on ſtaying there alone ; but when his companions were about to depart, his resolution was ſhaken, and he desired to be taken on board again. The captain, however, refuſed to admit him, and he was obliged to remain, having nothing but his clothes, bedding, a gun, and a ſmall quantity of powder and ball ; a hatchet, knife, and kettle ; his books, and mathematical and nautical inſtruments. He kept up his ſpirits tolerably till he ſaw the vessel put off, when (as he afterwards related) his heart yearned within him, and melted at parting with his comrades and all human ſociety at once.</p><p>“— Yet believe me, Arcas,</p><p>Such is the rooted love we bear mankind,</p><p>All ruffians as they were, I never heard A found so diſmal as their parting oars.”</p><p>Thomſon's Agamemnon.</p><p>Thus left sole monarch of the iſland, with plenty of the necessaries of life, he found himſelf in a ſituation hardly ſupportable. He had fiſh, goat’s flesh, turnips and other vegetables ; yet he grew dejected, languid, and melancholy, to such a degree as to he ſcarce able to refrain from doing violence to himſelf. Eighteen months pasſed before he could, by reaſoning, reading his bible, and ſtudy, be thoroughly reconciled to his condition. At length he grew happy, employing himſelf in decorating his huts, chasing the goats, whom he equalled in ſpeed, and ſcarcely ever failed of catching, He also tamed young kids, laming them to prevent their becoming wild ; and he kept a guard of tame cats about him, to defend him when aſleep from the rats, who were very troublesome. When his clothes were worn out, he made others of goats skins, but could not ſucceed in making ſhoes, with the uſe of which, however, habit, in time, enabled him to diſpenſe. His only liquor was water. He computed that he had caught 1000 goats during his abode in the iſland; of which he had let go 500, after marking them by flitting their ears. Commodore Anson’s people, who were there about 30 years after, found the firſt goat which they ſhot upon landing was thus marked, and as it appeared to be very old, concluded that it had been under the power of Selkirk. But it appears by captain Carteret’s account of his voyage in the Swallow ſloop, that other persons practiſed this mode of marking, as he found a<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0263.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0257"/>
goat With his ears thus slit on the neighbouring island of Mas-a-ſuera, where Selkirk never was. He made companions of his tame goats and cats, often dancing and singing with them. Though he conſtantly performed his devotions at ſtated hours, and read aloud ; yet, when be was taken off the iſland, his language, from diſuſe of converſation, was become ſcarcely intelligible. In this ſolitude he continued four years and four months ; during which time only two incidents happened which he thought worth relating, the occurrences of every day being in his circumſtances nearly ſimilar. The one was, that, purſuing a goat eagerly, he caught it juſt on the edge of a precipice, which was covered with buſhes, ſo that he did not perceive it, and he fell over to the bottom, where he lay (according to captain Roger’s account) 24 hours ſenſeleſs; but, as he related to Sir R. Steele, he computed, by the alteration of the moon, that he had lain three days. When he came to himself, he found the goat lying under him dead. It was with great difficulty that he could crawl to his habitation, whence he was unable to ſtir for ten days, and did not recover of his bruiſes for a long time. The other event was the arrival of a ſhip, which he at firſt ſuppoſed to be French : and ſuch is the natural love of ſociety in the human mind, that he was eager to abandon his ſolitary felicity, and ſurrender himſelf to them, although enemies ; but upon their landing, approaching them, he found them to be Spaniards, of whom he had too great a dread to truſt himſelf in their hands. They were by this time ſo near that it required all his agility to eſcape, which he effected by climbing into a thick tree, being ſhot at ſeveral times as he ran off. Fortunately the Spaniards did not diſcover him, though they ſtayed ſome time under the tree where he was hid, and killed ſome goats juſt by. In this ſolitude Selkirk remained until the 2d of February 1709, when he ſaw two ſhipe come into the bay, and knew them to be Engliſh. He immediately lighted a fire as a ſignal ; and on their coming on ſhore, found they were the Duke captain Rogers, and the Ducheſs captain Courtney, two privateers from Briſtol. He gave them the beſt entertainment he could afford ; and, as they had been a long time at ſea without freſh proviſions, the goats which he caught were highly acceptable. His habitation conſiſting of two huts, one to ſleep in, the other to dreſs his food in, was ſo obſcurely ſituated, and ſo difficult of acceſs, that only one of the ſhip’s officers would accompany him to it. Dampier, who was pilot on board the Huke, and knew Selkirk very well, told captain Rogers, that, when on board the Cinque-Ports, he was the beſt ſeaman on board that veſſel ; upon which captain Rogers appointed him maſter’s mate of the Huke. After a fortnight’s ſtay at Juan Fernandes, the ſhips proceeded on their cruize againſt the Spaniards ; plundered a town on the coaſt of Peru ; took a Manilla ſhip off California ; and returned by way of the Eaſt Indies to England, where they arrived the 1ſt of October 1711 ; Selkirk having been abſent eight years, more than half of which time he had ſpent alone in the iſland. The public curioſity being excited respecting him, he was induced to put his papers into the hands of Defoe, to arrange and form them into a regular narrative. Theſe papers muſt have been drawn up after he left Juan Fernandes, as he had no means of recording his tranſactions there. Captain Cooke remarks, as an extraordinary circumſtance, that he had</p><p>contrived to keep an account of the days of the week and month : but this might be done, as Defoe makes Robinſon Cruſoe do, by cutting notches in a poſt, or many other methods. From this account of Selkirk, Defoe took the idea of writing a more extenſive work, the romance of Robinſon Cruſoe, and very diſhoneſtly defrauded the original proprietor of his ſhare of the profits. Of the time or place or manner of this extraordinary man’s death we have received no account ; but in 1792 the cheſt and muſket which Selkirk had with him on the iſland were in the poſſeſſion of his grandnephew, John Selkirk weaver in Largo, where doubtless they are at preſent.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Selkirk,</hi> the capital of the county of the same name, is a ſmall town pleaſantly situated on a riſing ground, and enjoys an extenſive proſpect in all directions, eſpecially up and down the river Etterick. It is remarkable for nothing but thoſe plaintive airs produced in its neighbourhood, the natural ſimplicity of which are the pride of Scotland and the admiration of ſtrangers. W. Long. 2. 46. N.
