Hence he followed in the&nbsp;steps of Pius IX. and refused to recognize the existence of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de faclo</span><span class="font1"> government in any way whatsoever; he would not&nbsp;accept the subsidies it offered him, or allow Catholics to take&nbsp;any part in political life. During the earlier years of his reign&nbsp;he undoubtedIy had hopes of recovering his lost dominions&nbsp;with the help of Germany, and Bismarck was not the man to&nbsp;discourage such expectations. They were suddenly blasted&nbsp;when Germany, Italy and Austria entered into a Triple Alliance&nbsp;at the end of 1887. Thereafter Leo turned to France. Already&nbsp;in 1884 he had warned the French clergy against meddling in&nbsp;royalist intrigues; in 1892 he issued a much more stringent&nbsp;exhortation to French Catholics to rally to the Republic.&nbsp;An idea got abroad that he was looking to the time when the&nbsp;old dream of Lamennais and Gioberti might become a reality,&nbsp;and Italy would split up into a number of republics, amongst&nbsp;which the temporal power of the pope might find a place.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Christian Socialist movement sprang up in France and Belgium, and soon spread to Italy, Germany and Austria. It had undoubtedly done much to awaken interest in social problems,&nbsp;and to call forth philanthropic zeal; but the movement soon&nbsp;travelled far beyond the limits that Leo would have set to it.&nbsp;In Germany, in particular, it has grown into a political party&nbsp;connected with the Social Democrats; nor have the democratic&nbsp;socialists been slow to exploit their Christian allies for their&nbsp;own ends. And in other countries the attempt to bring religion into politics has sometimes had the effect of lowering&nbsp;religion, rather than ennobling politics. In an age of universal&nbsp;suffrage public men cannot afford to appeal to pure reason,&nbsp;or even to pure sentiment. Christian socialism becomes a&nbsp;real force when it translates itself into anti-Semitism; and&nbsp;anti-Semitism is at its strongest when it is pursuing one particular Jewish captain in the French artillery. Much on the&nbsp;same lines stands the Italian Catholic attempt to show that&nbsp;the Freemasons are the real founders of Italian independence,&nbsp;and to take the field against them with the help of Léon&nbsp;Taxil and “ Diana Vaughan.” And, quite apart from their&nbsp;political colouring, such attempts to meet the devotionaI tastes&nbsp;of the masses as the miracles of Lourdes, or the modern French&nbsp;religious press, lie well within the range of criticism. Nor&nbsp;have they even had the dubious merit of success. Dying in&nbsp;1903, Leo ΧΠΙ. was spared from seeing the failure of his policy&nbsp;of reconciliation with the French Republic; for the “ denunciation of the concordat ” (December 1905) and consequent&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plus X</span><span class="font1"> separation of Church and State took place under his&nbsp;successor, Pius X. What results this measure may-have on France it must be left to the future to decide. Nor is&nbsp;it yet possible to forecast the result of the only other sensational&nbsp;event that the reign of Pius X. has yet produced—his condemnation in 1007 of the complex movement known as&nbsp;Modernism. This began as an attempt to break loose</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ism^<sup>rn</sup>'</span><span class="font1"> from neo-Scholasticism so ardently patronized both by Pius IX. and Leo XIII., and to supplant the&nbsp;critical methods of the medieval doctors by those of modern&nbsp;scholarship; and its leaders have won special· distinction in&nbsp;the fields of Biblical criticism and ecclesiastical history. But</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Modernism soon broadened into a thoroughgoing revolt against the modes of thought and methods characteristic of the latter-day Vatican; its motto is that Catholicism is the strength of&nbsp;popery, but popery the weakness of Catholicism. By “popery ”&nbsp;must here be understood the belief that spiritual doctrines&nbsp;always lend themselves to a precise embodiment in black and&nbsp;white, and can thereafter be dealt with like so many clauses&nbsp;of an act of parliament. Modernists deny that the spirit of&nbsp;religion can be thus imprisoned in an unchangeable formula;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">they hold that it is always growing, and therefore in continual need of readjustment and restatement. On the other hand,&nbsp;they maintain that the present always has its roots in the past,&nbsp;and therefore they are opposed to any vioIent change; they&nbsp;consider, for instance, that northern Europe would have done&nbsp;better to listen to Erasmus than to Luther. But progress can&nbsp;leave little room to individual initiative, if it must always&nbsp;be orderly and systematic; and the Modernists accordingly&nbsp;show little sympathy with Protestantism. The core of their&nbsp;creed is a fervid belief in the infallibility of Catholic instinct,&nbsp;if only Catholic theology can be induced to leave it to develop&nbsp;in peace. Hitherto the theologians have shown small disposition to hold their hand; and several of the leading Modernists have been excommunicated (see especially the article&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Loisy,</span><span class="font1"> A. F.), while the whole movement was condemned in&nbsp;bitter and scathing language by Pius X.’s encyclicaI </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Pascendi&nbsp;gregis)</span><span class="font1"> against the Modernists. But ideas are difficult to kill,&nbsp;and it is possible that the Modernist movement may yet prove&nbsp;to be the opening chapter of a mighty revolution within the&nbsp;Church of Rome.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Church in England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The origin of the English Roman Catholics as a community separated from the National Church is generally heId to date&nbsp;from the accession of Queen Elizabeth in 1558. In the&nbsp;following year ,was passed an Act of Supremacy, whereby all&nbsp;public officials, clerical and lay, were required to acknowledge the supremacy of the queen “ as well in spiritual things&nbsp;or causes as temporal.” This declaration all the existing&nbsp;bishops, with two exceptions, refused to make; some fled&nbsp;the country, some were imprisoned, others simply deprived&nbsp;and placed under surveillance.@@<sup>2</sup> To the parish clergy the&nbsp;declaration was not systematically tendered; of those deprived&nbsp;of their livings a large number were allowed to remain on as&nbsp;chaplains in private families. From laymen, unless they&nbsp;happened to hold some public office, no declaration was&nbsp;expected; and during the earlier years of Elizabeth’s reign&nbsp;most of them continued to attend at their parish church.&nbsp;The line of division became much more acute when Pius V.&nbsp;deposed Elizabeth from her throne (1570); thenceforward&nbsp;her government looked on every Catholic as a potential rebel.&nbsp;Already it had passed a severe act against the CathoIics in&nbsp;1562; this was followed by other measures in 1571, 1580,&nbsp;1584, 1585, 1593. During the forty-five* years of Elizabeth’s-reign, however, only about 180 persons suffered death<sup>8</sup>—&nbsp;less than half the number of those whom the CathoBc zeal</span></p>
