I. c. 8. when one thruſts or ſtabs another, not then having a weapon drawn, or who hath not then firſt ſtricken the party ſtabbing, to that he dies thereof within six months after, the offender ſhall not have the benefit of clergy, though he did it not of malice aforethought. This ſtatute was made on account of the frequent quarrels and ſtabbings with ſhort daggers between the Scotch and the Engliſh, at the ac-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0724.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0718"/>
ceſſion of James I. ; and being therefore of a temporary nature, ought to have expired with the miſchief which it meant to remedy. For, in point of ſolid and ſubſtantial juſtice, it cannot be ſaid that the mode of killing, whether by ſtabbing, ſtrangling, or ſhooting, can either extenuate or enhance the guilt; unleſs where, as in the case of poiſoning, it carries with it internal evidence of cool and deliberate malice.<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Blackest. Comment. vol. iv. p. 193.</p></note> But the benignity of the law hath conſtrued the statute ſo favourably in behalf of the ſubject, and ſo ſtrictly when againſt him, that the offence of ſtabbing now ſtands almoſt upon the ſame footing as it did at the common law. Thus, (not to repeat the cases mentioned under <hi rend="smallcaps">Manslaughter,</hi> of ſtabbing an adultereſs, &amp;c. which are barely manſlaughter, as at common law), in the conſtruction of this statute it hath been doubted, whether, if the deceaſed had ſtruck at all before the mortal blow given, this does not take it out oſ the statute, tho’ in the preceding quarrel the stabber had given the firſt blow ; and it ſeems to be the better opinion, that this is not within the ftatute. Alſo it hath been resolved, that the killing a man, by throwing a hammer or other weapon, is not within the statute ; and whether a ſhot with a pistol be ſo or not is doubted. But if the party ſlain had a cudgel in his hand, or had thrown a pot or a bottle, or diſcharged a pistol at the party ſtabbing, this is a ſufficient reaſon for having a weapon drawn on his side within the words of the statute.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
