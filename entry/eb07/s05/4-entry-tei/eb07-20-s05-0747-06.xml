sometimes distinguished by the name <hi rend="italic">Long Stratford,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Stratford le Bow.</hi> It is the first town in the county of Essex, on the road from London, and, being connected with Middlesex by a bridge, said to be the oldest in England, over the river Lea, may be considered a suburb of the metropolis. It is in the hundred of Beacontree, and within the parish of West Ham. The soil is rich, but marshy, and intersected with canals and streams. Like the other suburbs of London, it has much increased</p><p>in population, as well as industrious pursuits. The East India Docks are within the parish. One of the pursuits in this place is that of practical chemistry, on a large scale, for making magnesia, the volatile salts, Prussian blue, and other preparations. There are, besides, bleachers, calico- printers, brewers, distillers, and millers. The parish of West Ham is divided into four parts, but the division of Stratford is by very far the largest, though not distinguished in the decennial population returns. The number of souls in the parish of West Ham amounted in 1801 to 6485, in 1811 to 8136, in 1821 to 9753, and in 1831 to 11,580.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stratford,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Fenny,</hi> a market-town in the county of Buckingham, seven miles from Stony Stratford, and forty-six from London. It is in the hundred of Newport, and is a chapelry of the parish of Blechley. Being on the great road from London to the north of England, and to Scotland, as well as to Ireland, this place chiefly depends on the money spent by travellers. It consists of one long street, on a rising ground, with the river Lofield in the bottom. There is a chapel of ease, dedicated to St Martin. The mother-church at Blechley, a mile and a half distant, is an elegant structure. There was formerly some employment in making lace, which has of late declined; but there is some trade by the Grand Junction Canal, and more is expected when the railway from London to Birmingham is completed. The population amounted in 1801 to 469, in 1811 to 481, in 1821 to 521, and in 1831 to 635, but in the whole parish to 1254.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stratford,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Stony,</hi> a market-town in the hundred of Newport and county of Buckingham, fifty-two miles from London. It stands on the Ouse, which divides it from Northamptonshire, and is on the Roman or Watling Street road. It is partly in the parish of Calderton, and partly in that of Wolverton, and had a church, or rather a chapel of ease, to each of these parishes, both of which were burnt in 1742 ; but a new one has been erected, and is a handsome structure, dedicated to St Giles. The town consists of one street, nearly a mile in length, with well-built houses on each side, mostly constructed of freestone. It has a good market on Friday, and but little trade on other days, as may be inferred from the state of its population, which amounted in 1801 to 1653, in 1811 to 1488, in 1821 to 1499, and in 1831 to 1619.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Stratford-on-Avon,</hi> a town in the hundred of Bar- lichway and county of Warwick, ninety-four miles from London. It stands on the navigable river Avon, over which is a bridge of fourteen arches. It is moderately well built, and has some trade in corn and malt, but no manufactures. It is chiefly remarkable as the birth-place of Shakspeare, whose memory has here been celebrated by splendid pageants. In the guild-hall is a large room, called Shak- speareâ€™s, with a portrait of him and of the celebrated actor Garrick. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 2418, in 1811 to 2842, in 1821 to 3069, and in 1831 to 3488.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
