It stands at the meeting of five great routes from Nish and Belgrade, Lorn and Vidin, Plevna and Rustchuk, Philippopolis and Constantinople, and Köstendil and Salonica. At present (1887) it is two days’ journey from the nearest railway station (Tatar-bazarjik), and as the seat of government is inconveniently near the south-west extremity of the kingdom ; but it lies on the prospective great railway route between Constantinople and Belgrade, and was in the eyes of those who selected it the prospective capital of a much more extensive territory. The climate of Sofia is subject to severe seasonal and diurnal changes : in January the thermometer sinks 4° below zero and in August approaches 100°, and the daily range is frequently 27 or 28 degrees. Minarets and gardens give a certain beauty to the aspect of the town itself, but the outskirts are painfully destitute of foliage. In an eastern suburb stands the royal palace, a vast building which cost more than 4,000,000 francs ; and in that neighbourhood, on the site of an abandoned Turkish quarter, quite a new “ European ” town has sprung up. The rest of Sofia retains its Turkish character, with tortuous streets and mean wooden houses. The modern cathedral and the archbishop’s palace are both large edifices of no special note. Of the many mosques the most striking is the Buyuk-Jami, with its nine metal cupolas ; but more historical interest attaches to the Sophia mosque, occupying the highest point in the town to which it gave its name. It is now completely in ruins (the result of an earthquake), but tradition, which in this case is confirmed by the architecture of the building, asserts that it was a Christian church erected by a certain Byzantine princess Sophia. Kanitz in 1871 still observed remains of old Byzantine frescos in the narthex. The public baths occupy a very extensive building, with separate suites of apartments for different nationalities or rather religions. The water as it issues from the springs has a temperature of 117°. Sofia exports hides and skins to Vienna, &amp;amp;c., and especially goat-skins to Marseilles ; its principal imports are Indian corn, wheat, and alcoholic liquors—the last a very large item. Formerly the population was 50,000. In 1870 Kanitz found 19,000—a liberal estimate—8000 being Bulgarians, 5000 Turks, 5000 Jews (a colony dating from the expulsion from Spain), 900 Gipsies. At present (1887) the total is 20,000. Close to the north of the town are extensive remains of strong Roman fortifications.</p><p>Sofia is the <hi rend="italic">Serdica</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Sardica</hi> of the Romans and Greeks (so called after the Serds or Sards), the <hi rend="italic">Triaditza</hi> of the Byzantine writers, and the <hi rend="italic">Sredec</hi> of the Slavs. “ Sardica is my Rome,” said Constantine before he thought of his new capital on the Bosphorus. It had already been made the capital of Dacia Ripensis by Aurelian, and about 343 it became famous as the seat of a church council. The town was plundered by Attila ; and in 809 it was captured by the Bulgarians, who held it until the Turks got possession of it by stratagem in 1378, or more probably 1382. In 1443 Sofia was for a brief period occupied by the Hungarian John Hunyady (Corvinus), and on the defeat of his enterprise was laid waste by the retreating army. In 1829 it was the headquarters of Mustapha Pasha of Scutari, whose ravages have made the name of Albanian a word of terror to the children in Sofia even now. The Russians entered Sofia on 4th January 1878, after Gourko's passage of the Balkans.</p><p>See Kanitz, <hi rend="italic">Donau Bulgarien,</hi> 1877 ; Laveleye, <hi rend="italic">La Péninsule des Balkans,</hi> 1886.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
