<p><span class="font1">by a single row of columns. The first actual work, however, was not begun till 1870, when the construction of an iron structure&nbsp;on </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">single row of columns was&nbsp;undertaken. The superiority, so&nbsp;far as the convenience of passengers is concerned, of an elevated&nbsp;over an underground railway, when&nbsp;both are worked by steam locomotives, and the great economy&nbsp;and rapidity of construction, led to&nbsp;the quick development and extension of this general design. By&nbsp;the year 1878 there were four&nbsp;parallel lines in the city of New&nbsp;York, and constructions of the&nbsp;same character had already been&nbsp;projected in Brooklyn and Chicago&nbsp;and, with certain modifications of&nbsp;details, in Berlin. In the year&nbsp;1894 an elevated railway was built&nbsp;in Liverpool, and in 1900 a similar&nbsp;railway was constructed in Boston,&nbsp;U. S. A., and the construction of a&nbsp;new one undertaken in New York.&nbsp;These elevated railways as a rule&nbsp;follow the lines of streets, and are&nbsp;of two general types. One (fig. 31),&nbsp;the earliest form, consisted of a&nbsp;single row of columns supporting&nbsp;two lines of longitudinal girders&nbsp;carrying the rails, the lateral stability of the structure being obtained by anchoring the feet of the columns to their foundations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The other type (fig. 32) has two rows of columns&nbsp;connected at the top by&nbsp;transverse girders, which in&nbsp;turn carry the longitudinal&nbsp;girders that support the&nbsp;railway. In Berlin, on the&nbsp;Stadtbahn—which for a&nbsp;part of its length traverses&nbsp;private property—masonry&nbsp;arches, or earthen embankments between retaining&nbsp;walls, were substituted for&nbsp;the metallic structure</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">wherever possible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The next great develop-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ment, marking the third step in the progress of&nbsp;intra-urban railway construction, took place in&nbsp;1886, when J. H. Greathead&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q. v.</span><span class="font1"> ) began the City &amp;&nbsp;South London railway, ex-tending under the Thames&nbsp;from the Monument to&nbsp;Stockwell, a distance of&nbsp;3½ m. Its promoters recognized the unsuitability of&nbsp;ordinary steam locomotives&nbsp;for underground railways, and intended to work it by means of&nbsp;a moving cable; but before it was completed, electric traction&nbsp;had developed so far as to be available for use on such lines.&nbsp;Electricity, therefore, and not the cable, was installed (fig. 33).&nbsp;In the details of construction the shield was the novelty. In&nbsp;principle it had been invented by Sir Marc I. Brunel for the construction of the original Thames tunnel, and it was afterwards&nbsp;improved by Beach, of New York, and finally developed by&nbsp;Greathead. (For the details of the shield and method of its&nbsp;operation, see Tunnel. ) By means of the shield Great-head cut a circular hole at a depth ranging from 40 to 80 ft.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">below the surface, with an external diameter of 10 ft. 9 in.; this he lined with cast-iron segments bolted together, giving a</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">clear diameter of 10 ft. 2 in. Except at the shafts, which were sunk on proposed station sites, there was no interference with&nbsp;the surface of the streets or with street traffic during construction. Two tunnels were built approximately parallel,&nbsp;each taking a single track. The cross-section of the cars was&nbsp;made to conform approximately to the section of the tunnel,&nbsp;the idea being that each train would act like a piston in a&nbsp;cylinder, expelling in front of it a column of air, to be forced&nbsp;up the station shaft next ahead of the train, and sucking down&nbsp;a similar column through the station shaft just behind. This&nbsp;arrangement was expected to ensure a sufficient change in air&nbsp;to keep such railways properly ventilated, but experience has&nbsp;proved it to be ineffective for the  purpose. This method of&nbsp;construction has been used for building other railways in&nbsp;Glasgow and London, and in the latter city alone the “ tube&nbsp;railways ’’ of this character have a length of some 40 m.&nbsp;The later examples of these railways have a diameter ranging&nbsp;from 13 to 15 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The fourth step in the development of intra-urban railways was to go to the other extreme from the deep tunnel which&nbsp;Greathead introduced. In 1893 the construction was completed in Budapest of an underground railway with a thin,&nbsp;flat roof, consisting of steel beams set close together, with small&nbsp;longitudinal jack arches between them, the street pavement</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">resting directly on the roof thus formed (fig. 34). The object was to bring the level of the station platforms as close to the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
