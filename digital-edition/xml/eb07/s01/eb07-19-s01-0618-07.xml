an island in the Mediterranean, belonging to the kingdom of the Two Sicilies. It is divided by a channel three miles across from Lipari to the north-west of that island. It is about fourteen miles in circuit. A valley between two mountains, called Fossa Felice, is extremely fertile, and produces a great revenue from the exportation of grain, fruit, pulse, capers, salt, alum, and wine, the last of which, known by the name Malvasia, is highly valued. It is evidently of volcanic origin, having vestiges of ancient craters and several thermal springs. It was known to the ancients by the name of Didyme, or twins, from the two conical mountains, which are prominent objects when seen from the sea. The population consists of 4000 persons. The chief town is Amalfi, near to which is good anchorage. Long. 14. 47. 35. E. Lat. of Amalfi church, 38. 35. 40. N.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
