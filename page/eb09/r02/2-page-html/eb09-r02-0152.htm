<p><span class="font1">bodies. Perhaps the finest collection of works of this class is at La Verna, not far from Arezzo (see Vasari, ed.&nbsp;Milanesi, ii. p. 179). The best of these, three large&nbsp;retables with representations of the Annunciation, the&nbsp;Crucifixion, and the Madonna giving her Girdle to St&nbsp;Thomas, are probably the work of Andrea himself, the&nbsp;others being by his sons. In 1489 Andrea made a beautiful relief of the Virgin and two Angels, now over the&nbsp;archive room door in the Florentine Opera del Duomo ;&nbsp;for this he was paid twenty gold florins (see Cavallucci,&nbsp;0<sup>,</sup>. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mana del Fiore).</span><span class="font1"> In the same year he modelled the&nbsp;fine tympanum relief over a door of Prato cathedral, with&nbsp;a half-length figure of the Madonna between St Stephen&nbsp;and St Lawrence, surrounded by a frame of angels’ heads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1491 Andrea was still working at Prato, where many of his best reliefs still exist. One of his finest works is a&nbsp;large retable at Volterra in the church of S. Girolamo,&nbsp;dated 1501 ; it represents the Last Judgment, and is remarkable for the fine modelling of the figures, especially&nbsp;that of the archangel Michael, and a nude kneeling figure&nbsp;of a youth who has just risen from his tomb. Other late&nbsp;works of known date are a Resurrection of Christ, made&nbsp;in 1501 for S. Frediano at Florence (the lower half of this&nbsp;only exists, in the court of the Casa Mozzi), and a medallion of the Virgin in Glory, surrounded by angels, made&nbsp;in 1505 for Pistoia cathedral.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> Andrea’s last known relief&nbsp;is a Nativity, made in 1515 for S. Maria in Pian di&nbsp;Mugnone at Florence.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">III., IV. Five of Andrea’s seven sons worked with their father, and after his death carried on the Robbia fabrique ;&nbsp;the dates of their birth are shown in the table on p. 588&nbsp;above. Early in life two of them came under the influence of Savonarola, and took monastic orders at his Dominican convent ; these were Marco, who adopted the name&nbsp;of Fra Luca, and Paolo, called Fra Ambrogio. One relief&nbsp;by the latter, a Nativity with four life-sized figures of&nbsp;rather poor work, is in the Cappella degli Spagnuoli in&nbsp;the Sienese convent of S. Spirito ; a MS. in the convent&nbsp;archives records that it was made in 1504.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The chief existing work known to be by the second&nbsp;son Luca is the very rich and beautiful tile pavement in&nbsp;the uppermost story of Raphael’s loggie at the Vatican,&nbsp;finely designed and painted in harmonious majolica colours.&nbsp;This was made by Luca at Raphael’s request and under his&nbsp;supervision in 1518.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> It is still in very fine preservation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">VI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Giovanni della Robbia (1469-1529?) during a&nbsp;great part of his life worked as assistant to his father,&nbsp;Andrea, and in many cases the enamelled sculpture of the&nbsp;two cannot be distinguished. Some of Giovanni’s independent works are of great merit, especially the earlier ones ;&nbsp;during the latter part of his life his reliefs deteriorated in&nbsp;style, owing mainly to the universal decadence of the time.&nbsp;A very large number of pieces of Robbia ware which are&nbsp;attributed to Andrea, and even to the elder Luca, were&nbsp;really by the hand of Giovanni. One of his finest works,&nbsp;quite equal in beauty to anything of his father’s, from whom&nbsp;the design of the figures was probably taken, is the washing-fountain in the sacristy of S. Maria Novella at Florence,&nbsp;made in 1497.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup> It is a large arched recess with a view&nbsp;of the seashore, not very decorative in style, painted on&nbsp;majolica tiles at the back. There are also two very beautiful painted majolica panels of fruit-trees let into the lower&nbsp;part. In the tympanum of the arch is a very lovely white</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">relief of the Madonna between two Adoring Angels (see fig. 3). Long coloured garlands of fruit and flowers are held</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">by nude boys reclining on the top of the arch. All this part is of enamelled clay, but the basin of the fountain is&nbsp;of white marble. Neither Luca nor Andrea was in the&nbsp;habit of signing his work, but Giovanni often did so,&nbsp;usually adding the date, probably because other potters&nbsp;had begun to imitate the Robbia ware.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Giovanni lacked the original talent of Luca and Andrea, and so lie not only copied their work but even reproduced&nbsp;in clay the marble sculpture of Pollaiuolo, Da Settignano,&nbsp;Verrocchio, and others. A relief by him, evidently taken&nbsp;from Mino da Fiesole, exists in the Palazzo Castracane&nbsp;Staccoli. Among the very numerous other works of Giovanni are the large retable in the Castellani chapel of S.&nbsp;Croce, a relief in the wall of a convent in the Via Nazionale&nbsp;at Florence, and two reliefs in the Bargello dated 1521&nbsp;and 1522. The latter is a many-coloured relief of the&nbsp;Nativity, and was taken from the church of S. Girolamo&nbsp;in Florence ; it is a too pictorial work, marred by the use&nbsp;of many different planes. Its predella has a small relief&nbsp;of the Adoration of the Magi, and is inscribed “ Hoc opus&nbsp;fecit Joanes Andree de Robia, ac posuit hoc in tempore&nbsp;die ultima lulii ano. Dili, mdxxii.” At Pisa in the church&nbsp;of S. Silvestro is a relief in Giovanni’s later and poorer&nbsp;manner dated 1520; it is a Madonna surrounded by&nbsp;angels, with saints below—the whole overcrowded with&nbsp;figures and ornaments. Giovanni’s largest and perhaps&nbsp;finest work is the polychromatic frieze on the outside of&nbsp;the Del Ceppo Hospital at Pistoia, for which he received&nbsp;various sums of money between 1525 and 1529, as is&nbsp;recorded in documents which still exist among the archives&nbsp;of the hospital.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>6</sup> The subjects of this frieze are the Seven&nbsp;Works of Mercy, forming' a continuous band of sculpture&nbsp;in high relief, well modelled and designed in a very broad&nbsp;sculpturesque way, but a little injured perhaps by the&nbsp;crudeness of some of its colouring. Six of these reliefs&nbsp;are by Giovanni, namely, Clothing the Naked, Washing&nbsp;the Feet of Pilgrims, Visiting the Sick, Visiting Prisoners,&nbsp;Burying the Dead, and Feeding the Hungry. The seventh,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
