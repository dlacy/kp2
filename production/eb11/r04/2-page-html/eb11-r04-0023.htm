<p><span class="font1">The rural servitudes of way and water were no doubt very early recognized, for they ranked as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res tnancipi,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the XII. Tables contained various regulations in reference to&nbsp;the former. Usufruct, too, was probably not unknown; but&nbsp;the urban praedial servitudes bear the impress of a somewhat&nbsp;later jurisprudence. Pignorate and hypothecary rights were&nbsp;certainly unknown as rights protected by action.<sup>@@1</sup> Between&nbsp;private parties the only thing legally recognized of the nature&nbsp;of a real security was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fiducia</span><span class="font1"> that is described above.&nbsp;Approaching more nearly to the modern idea of a mortgage&nbsp;was the security </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praedibus praediisque</span><span class="font1"> required by the state&nbsp;from those indebted to it in assurance of their obligations.&nbsp;Here there was the double guarantee of sureties </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(praedes)</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;mortgages of lands of theirs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(praedia subsignata); </span><span class="font1">but how&nbsp;they were dealt with when the debtor made default is by no&nbsp;means clear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Changes in the Law of Succession.—</span><span class="font1">The two forms of testament of the regal period, viz., that made in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Forms of</span><span class="font1"> the curies and that by soldiers on the eve of battle,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">testa-</span><span class="font1"> still remained in use in the early Republic; though&nbsp;meuf. before the end of the Republic they were displaced&nbsp;by the general adoption of that executed with the copper and&nbsp;scales </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(teslamentum per aes et libram).</span><span class="font1"> It seems to be the&nbsp;general opinion that it was to the first two alone that the&nbsp;words applied which stood in the forefront of the provisions&nbsp;of the XII. Tables about inheritance: “uti legassit suae rei,&nbsp;ita jus esto.” Whether resort was to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font1"> or to the&nbsp;army, the testator’s own will in the matter was henceforth&nbsp;to be supreme. There was to be no more reference to the&nbsp;pontiffs as to the expediency of the testament in view of the&nbsp;interests of the family </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacra,</span><span class="font1"> and of creditors of the testator’s;&nbsp;from legislators, sanctioning a departure from the ordinary&nbsp;rules of succession, the assembled Quirites became merely&nbsp;witnesses—recipients of the oral declaration of the testator’s&nbsp;will in regard to his inheritance.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The testament with the copper and the scales is depicted by Gaius as a written instrument. But he presents it in what&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Testa-</span><span class="font1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be described as the third stage of its history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">meat</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its probable origin has been explained </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(supra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 534).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">per aes et</span><span class="font1"> <sub>was</sub> originally not a testament but only a makeshift for one. A plebeian was not qualified in the regal period to make a testament in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comitia}</span><span class="font1"> so, instead,&nbsp;he transferred his estate to a friend on whom he could rely,&nbsp;with instructions how to distribute it on his death. The&nbsp;transferee was called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae emptor,</span><span class="font1"> because the conveyance</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">was in form a mancipation for a nominal price.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is not at all unlikely that the same device may occasionally have been resorted to by a patrician who had neglected to make a&nbsp;regular testament, and was seized with mortal illness before he had&nbsp;an opportunity of appealing to the curies.<sup>@@3</sup> But such a disposition&nbsp;was not a testament, and may not have been so called. A.testa-ment was the nomination of a person as the testator’s heir. It&nbsp;made the person instituted as fully the representative of the testator&nbsp;after his death as his heir-at-law would have been had he died</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">intestate. The original </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa</span><span class="font1"> mancipation that opened the way for the testament </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram</span><span class="font1"> conferred upon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae&nbsp;emptor</span><span class="font1"> no such character. Gaius says that he stood in place of an&nbsp;heir </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(heredis loco),</span><span class="font1"> inasmuch as he had such of an heir’s rights and&nbsp;duties as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae venditor</span><span class="font1"> had it in his power to confer and&nbsp;impose; but the transaction was but a conveyance of estate, with&nbsp;a limitation of the right of the grantee. It has been Argued that,&nbsp;as the law did not recognize conditional mancipation, the conveyance&nbsp;must have operated, as a complete and immediate divestiture of&nbsp;the grantee. But this does not follow. For it was quite competent&nbsp;for a man, in transferring property by mancipation, to reserve to&nbsp;himself a life interest; and apparently it was equally competent&nbsp;for him to postpone delivery of possession, without infringing the&nbsp;rule that the mancipation itself could not be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex certo tempore.</span><span class="font1"> So&nbsp;far as one can sec, therefore, there was nothing to prevent the&nbsp;grantor of the conveyance (or quasi-testator) bargaining that he was&nbsp;to retain the possession till his death; and, as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familia</span><span class="font1"> was an&nbsp;aggregate of .estate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(univer sitas rerum)</span><span class="font1"> which retained its identity&nbsp;notwithstanding any change in its component elements, he must&nbsp;in such case have been as free to operate on it while he survived,&nbsp;as if he had never conveyed it by mancipation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Cicero incidentally remarks<sup>@@4</sup> what indeed the nature of the transaction of itself very distinctly suggests—that the true&nbsp;testament with the copper and the scales had its statutory&nbsp;warrant, not in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uti legassit suae ret</span><span class="font1"> of the XII. Tables, but&nbsp;in the provision contained in the words: “ cum nexum faciet&nbsp;mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto.” Reflection on the import and comprehensiveness of these words led&nbsp;the pontifical interpreters to the conclusion that there was&nbsp;nothing in them to prevent the direct institution of an heir&nbsp;in the course of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">verba muncupata</span><span class="font1"> engrafted on a mancipation. From the moment this view was adopted and put in&nbsp;practice the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae mancipatio</span><span class="font1"> ceased to be a transfer of the&nbsp;testator’s estate to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae emptor \</span><span class="font1"> the latter’s purchase&nbsp;was now for form’s sake only, though still an indispensable&nbsp;form, since it was it alone that, according to the letter of the&nbsp;statute, imparted efficacy to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nuncupatio.</span><span class="font1"> But it was the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nuncupatio</span><span class="font1">—the oral declaration addressed to the witnesses—&nbsp;that really contained the testamentary disposition, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;institution of an heir, with such other provisions as the testator&nbsp;thought fit to embody in it. This was the second stage in the&nbsp;history of the testament </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram.</span><span class="font1"> The third was&nbsp;marked by the introduction of tahlets in which the testamentary&nbsp;provisions were set out in writing, and which the testator&nbsp;displayed to the witnesses, folded and tied up in the usual&nbsp;manner, declaring that they contained the record of his last&nbsp;will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Gaius narrates the words spoken by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae emptor</span><span class="font1"> and addressed to the testator as follows: “ Your estate and belongings&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(familia pecuniaque tua),</span><span class="font1"> be they mine by purchase with this bit&nbsp;of copper and these copper scales, subject to your instructions, but&nbsp;in my keeping, that so you may lawfully make your testament&nbsp;according to the statute </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(quo lu jure testamentum facere possis&nbsp;secundum legem publicam).&quot;</span><span class="font1"> The meaning of the words “in my&nbsp;keeping </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(endo custodelam meant)&quot;</span><span class="font1"> is not quite obvious; they are&nbsp;probably remnants of an older style, but may be due to a clerical&nbsp;error of the writer of the Verona MS. Certain it is that they no more&nbsp;imported a real custody than a real property in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae emptor}&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">for the testator remained so entirely master of his estate that the&nbsp;very next day if he pleased he might mancípate it. anew to a different&nbsp;purchaser, and nuncupate fresh testamentary writings. The nuncupation by the testator was in these terms: “ As is written in these&nbsp;tablets so do I give, so do I legate, so do I declare my will; therefore,&nbsp;Quirites, grant me your testimony &quot;; and, adds Gaius, “ whatever&nbsp;the testator had set down in detail in his testamentary tablets he&nbsp;was regarded as declaring and confirming by this general statement.”&nbsp;To the appeal of the testator the witnesses responded by giving their&nbsp;testimony in words which unfortunately are not preserved; and&nbsp;then the testament was sealed by testator, officials and witnesses,&nbsp;the seals being outside according to the early fashion.<sup>@@5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although this testament with the copper and the scales w*as justified in the first instance by the provision of the XII. Tables as to the effect of nuncupative words annexed to a mancipation, yet. in&nbsp;course of time it came to be subordinated to that other one which&nbsp;dealt directly with testamentary dispositions: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uti legassit suae rei,&nbsp;ita jus esto.</span><span class="font1"> Upon the w’ords </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">uti legassit</span><span class="font1"> the widest possible meaning&nbsp;was put by the interpreters: not only was a testator held entitled&nbsp;on the strength of them to appoint tutors to wife and children, to&nbsp;enfranchise slaves and make bequests to legatees, but he might</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
