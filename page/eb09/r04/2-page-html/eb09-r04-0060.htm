<p><span class="font1">and bark, and shipbuilding is carried on as well as fishing. There is a large market every alternate Wednesday, and considerable business in cattle, sheep, corn, wool, and&nbsp;hops is transacted. Rye is a quaint, compactly-built town&nbsp;perched upon the rock to which for centuries it was&nbsp;restricted, but in the course of the last half-century it has&nbsp;gradually extended itself over the northern slopes beyond&nbsp;the town wall. It is excellently drained, abundantly&nbsp;supplied with clear spring water, and very healthy.&nbsp;The church, said to be the largest parish church in England, is of very mixed architecture, chiefly Transitional,&nbsp;Norman, and Early English ; the nave and high chancel&nbsp;were judiciously restored in 1882, according to designs by&nbsp;the late Mr G. E. Street. Of the old fortifications there&nbsp;still remain portions of the town wall, much hidden by&nbsp;newer buildings, a strong quadrangular tower built by&nbsp;William of Ypres, earl of Kent, and lord warden in the time&nbsp;of Stephen, and now forming part of the police station,&nbsp;and a handsome gate with a round tower on each side,&nbsp;known as the Sandgate, at the entrance into Rye from the&nbsp;London road. Rye ceased in 1885 to be a parliamentary&nbsp;borough, but gives its name to the eastern division of the&nbsp;county. The population in 1881 was 4224.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the early history of Rye little is known. In the mediæval French chronicles it is always mentioned as “La Rie.” Having&nbsp;been conferred upon the abbey of Fecamp by Edward the Confessor,&nbsp;it was taken back by King Henry III. into his own hands, “for&nbsp;the better defence of his realm,” and received from that sovereign&nbsp;the full rights and privileges of a Cinque Port under the title of&nbsp;“Ancient Town.” In consequence of the frequent incursions of&nbsp;the French, by whom it was sacked and burnt three times in the&nbsp;14th century, it was fortified by order of Edward III. on the landward side, the steep precipitous sides of the rock affording ample&nbsp;protection towards the sea. In addition to the naval services&nbsp;rendered by Rye as a Cinque Port under the Plantagenet and&nbsp;Tudor sovereigns, it was a principal port of communication with&nbsp;France in times of peace,—for which reason successive bands of&nbsp;Huguenots fled thither between 1562 and 1685, many of whom&nbsp;settled at Rye and have left representatives now living.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RYEZHITZA, a town of European Russia at the head of a district in the Vitebsk government, in 56° 30' N. lat.&nbsp;and 27' 2' E. long., 198 miles north-west from Vitebsk&nbsp;on the railway between St Petersburg and Warsaw, near&nbsp;the Ryezhitza, which falls into Lake Luban. Its population increased from 7306 (2902 Jews) in 1867 to&nbsp;about 9000 in 1881 ; but its importance is mainly historical. The cathedral is a modern building (1846).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ryezhitza, or, as it is called in the Livonian chronicles, Roziten, was founded in 1285 by Wilhelm von Harburg to keep in subjection the Lithuanians and Letts. The castle was continually the&nbsp;object of hostile attacks. In 1559 the Livonian order, exhausted&nbsp;by the war with Russia, gave it in pawn to Poland, and, though&nbsp;it was captured by the Russians in 1567 and 1577, and had its&nbsp;fortifications dismantled by the Swedes during the war of 1656-1660, it continued Polish till 1772, when White Russia was united&nbsp;with the Russian empire. In early times Ryezhitza was a large&nbsp;and beautiful town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RYLAND, William Wynne (1738-1783), engraver, was born in London in July 1738, the son of an engraver&nbsp;and copper plate printer. He studied under Ravenet, and&nbsp;in Paris under Boucher and J. P. le Bas. After spending&nbsp;five years on the Continent he returned to England, and&nbsp;having engraved portraits of George III. and Lord Bute&nbsp;after Ramsay (a commission declined by Strange), and a&nbsp;portrait of Queen Charlotte and the Princess Royal after&nbsp;Francis Cotes, R.A., he was appointed engraver to the&nbsp;king. In 1766 he became a member of the Incorporated&nbsp;Society of Artists, and he exhibited with them and in the&nbsp;Royal Academy. In his later life Ryland abandoned line-engraving, and introduced “chalk-engraving,” in which&nbsp;the line is composed of stippled dots, a method by means&nbsp;of which he attained great excellence, and in which he&nbsp;transcribed Mortimer’s King John Signing Magna Charta,&nbsp;and copied the drawings of the old masters and the works&nbsp;of Angelica Kauffman. He traded largely in prints, but&nbsp;in consequence of his extravagant habits his affairs became&nbsp;involved ; he was convicted of forging bills upon the East&nbsp;India Company, and, after attempting to commit suicide,&nbsp;was executed at Tyburn on the 29th of August 1783. A&nbsp;short memoir of Ryland was published the year after his&nbsp;death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RYMER, Thomas (1641-1713), historiographer royal, was the younger son of Ralph Rymer, lord of the manor&nbsp;of Brafferton in Yorkshire, described by Clarendon as&nbsp;“ possessed of a good estate ” and executed for his share in&nbsp;the “ Presbyterian rising” of 1663. Thomas was probably&nbsp;born at Yafforth Hall early in 1641, and was educated at&nbsp;a private school kept by Thomas Smelt, a noted Royalist,&nbsp;with whom Rymer was “ a great favourite,” and “ well&nbsp;known for his great critical skill in human learning,&nbsp;especially in poetry and history.” @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He was admitted as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pensionarius minor</span><span class="font1"> at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, on April 29, 1658, but left&nbsp;the university without taking a degree. On May 2, 1666,&nbsp;he became a member of Gray’s Inn, and was called to the&nbsp;bar on June 16, 1673. His first appearance in print was&nbsp;as translator of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cicerds Prince</span><span class="font1"> (1668), from the Latin&nbsp;treatise (1608) drawn up for Prince Henry. He also&nbsp;translated Rapin’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reflections on Aristotlds Treatise of&nbsp;Poesie</span><span class="font1"> (1674), and followed the principles there set forth&nbsp;in a tragedy in verse, licensed September 13, 1677, called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edgar, or the English Monarch,</span><span class="font1"> which was not, however,&nbsp;very successful. The printed editions of 1678, 1691, and&nbsp;1693 belong to the same issue, with new title-pages.&nbsp;Rymer’s views on the drama were again given to the&nbsp;world in the shape of a printed letter to Fleetwood Shep-heard, the friend of Prior, under the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Tragedies&nbsp;of the Last Age Considered</span><span class="font1"> (1678). To </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ovid’s Epistles&nbsp;Translatedby Several Hands</span><span class="font1"> (1680), with preface by Dryden, “Penelope to Ulysses” was contributed by Rymer,&nbsp;who was also one of the “hands” who Englished the&nbsp;Plutarch of 1683-86. The life of Nicias fell to his share.&nbsp;He furnished a preface to Whitelocke’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memorials of English Afairs</span><span class="font1"> (1682), and wrote in 1681 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A General Drauglvt&nbsp;and Prospect of the Government of Europe,</span><span class="font1"> reprinted in&nbsp;1689 and 1714 as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Of the Antiquity, Power, and Decay of&nbsp;Parliaments,</span><span class="font1"> where, ignorant of his future dignity, the&nbsp;critic had the misfortune to observe, “You are not to&nbsp;expect truth from an historiographer royal.” He contributed three pieces to the collection of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poems to the&nbsp;Memory of Edmund Waller</span><span class="font1"> (1688), afterwards reprinted&nbsp;in Dryden’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Miscellany Poems,</span><span class="font1"> and is said to have written&nbsp;the Latin inscription on Waller’s monument in Beaconsfield&nbsp;churchyard. He produced a congratulatory poem upon the&nbsp;arrival of Queen Mary in 1689. His next piece of authorship was to translate the sixth elegy of the third book&nbsp;of Ovid’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tristia</span><span class="font1"> for Dryden’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Miscellany Poems</span><span class="font1"> (1692,&nbsp;p. 148). On the death of Thomas Shadwell in 1692&nbsp;Rymer received the appointment of historiographer royal,&nbsp;at a yearly salary of £200. Immediately afterwards&nbsp;appeared his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Short Vicw of Tragedy</span><span class="font1"> (1693), criticizing&nbsp;Shakespeare and Ben Jonson, which produced </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Impartial&nbsp;Cmtixk</span><span class="font1"> (1693) of Dennis, the epigram of Dryden. @@<sup>2</sup> and the&nbsp;judgment of Macaulay that Rymer was “the worst critic&nbsp;that ever lived.” Within eight months of his official&nbsp;appointment Rymer was directed (August 26,1693) to carry</span></p>
