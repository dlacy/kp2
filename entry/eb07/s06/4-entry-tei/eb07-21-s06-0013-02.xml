a seaport town of South Wales, in the county of Glamorgan, 206 miles from London. It stands at the mouth of the river Tawy, which serves as its haven. It is a tidal harbour, and can only be entered with the flood-tides, but it has a good dry dock. The town is in a semicircular form, on a rising ground, and has a good appearance. Thc chief street is wide and long, and contains some very handsome houses of private persons, but scarcely a public building worthy of notice. The shipping that arrives and departs is numerous. The copper ore raised in Cornwall is brought to this town to be smelted in its vicinity. A vast quantity of coal is raised in the neighbour</p><p>hood, part of which is used in the several manufactories ; but a large portion is also exported to Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset. There are establishments for making pottery-ware, tin, cast and wrought iron, and beer. Swansea has of late become a much-frequented bathing place, and has been supplied with all the institutions usually found in similar towns, lt is a borough, and for municipal purposes is divided into three wards, and is governed by a portreeve, six aldermen, and seventeen councillors. Jointly with Aber- avon, Kenfig, Loughor, and Neath, it returns one member to the House of Commons. It has several fine gentlemenâ€™s seats near it. The market is on Wednesday, but the town is well supplied with provisions daily. The inhabitants amounted in 1821 to 10,007, and in 1831 to 13,256.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
