<p><span class="font2">The same origin is to be sought for the Alexander myths found in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Renart le Bestoume</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Speculum Historiale&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of Vincentius Bellovacensis. Quintus Curtius was largely&nbsp;used for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Alexaηdreis (c.</span><span class="font2"> 1176-1202) of Gaultier de&nbsp;Châtillon.</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>1</sup> It was the theme of poetry in all European&nbsp;languages : six or seven German poets dealt with the&nbsp;subject, and it may be read in English, Spanish, Danish,&nbsp;Swedish, Icelandic, Flemish, and Bohemian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Towards the close of the 15th century an anonymous writer worked up the subject into a prose romance, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H histoire du noble et vaillant roy Alixandre le Grant</span><span class="font2"> (1506), in&nbsp;which the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Historiα de Præliis</span><span class="font2"> is followed with tolerable&nbsp;exactness. After an account of the ancient history of&nbsp;Macedonia and of the intrigue of Nectanebus we are told&nbsp;how Philip dies, and how Alexander subdues Rome and receives tribute from all European nations. He then makes&nbsp;his Persian expedition ; the Indian campaign gives occasion&nbsp;to descriptions of all kinds of wonders. The conqueror&nbsp;visits a cannibal kingdom and finds many marvels in the&nbsp;palace of Porus, among them a vine with golden branches,&nbsp;emerald leaves, and fruit of other precious stones. In one&nbsp;country he meets with women, who, after burial in the&nbsp;winter, become alive again in the spring full of youth and&nbsp;beauty. Having reached the ends of the earth and conquered all nations, he aspires to the dominion of the air.&nbsp;He obtains a magic glass cage, yoked with eight griffins,&nbsp;flies through the clouds, and, thanks to enchanters knowing&nbsp;the language of birds, gets information as to their manners&nbsp;and customs, and ultimately receives their submission.&nbsp;The excessive heat of the upper regions compels him to&nbsp;descend, and he next visits, the bottom of the sea in a kind&nbsp;of diving-bell. The fish crowd round him and pay homage. Alexander returns to Babylon, is crowned with much&nbsp;pomp, and mass is celebrated. He dies by poison soon&nbsp;afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Vœux du Paon and Rcstor du Paon are chansons de geste attached to the Alexander cycle, to which also belongs Florimont,&nbsp;a poem by Aimé de Varennes, said to have been written in 1188.&nbsp;Florimont was a son of the duke of Albania and father of Philip&nbsp;of Macedon by the heiress of the latter country. This poem gave&nbsp;rise to two prose romances—La conqueste de Grèce fniete par Philippe&nbsp;de Madien, by Perrinet du Pin, first printed in 1527, and Histoire&nbsp;du roi Florimond (1528).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. We now come to the third order of romances included in the cycle of “ Rome la Grant,” or those which merely reproduce the names of antiquity. The enchanter&nbsp;Virgil is the most famous of those who have given rise to&nbsp;prose works, and what passes under his name is less a&nbsp;romance than a collection of popular tales, many of Eastern&nbsp;derivation. Among romances in verse we have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eraclès,&nbsp;Anseys de Carthage, Cleomadès, A this et Profilias, ProFe-silaus,</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ypomedon.</span><span class="font2"> The first part of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Athis et Profilias,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">by Alexandre de Bernai (latter part of 12th century), is&nbsp;adapted from the tale of the two merchants in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Disciplina Clericalis</span><span class="font2"> of Pedro Alfonso, and is the source of&nbsp;Boccaccio’s “ Tito e Gisippo ” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Decam.,</span><span class="font2"> x. 8). In Γjoo∞e-</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">don,</span><span class="font2"> written by Hue of Rotelande about 1185, most of&nbsp;the characters are named from the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Thebaic.</span><span class="font2"> As early as&nbsp;the year 1210 we find a rhymed translation of Ovid’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Metamorphoses</span><span class="font2"> in German by Albrecht von Halberstadt.&nbsp;From Ovid is taken the story of Pyramus and Thisbe in&nbsp;Chaucer’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Legend of Good Women,</span><span class="font2"> which is the subject of&nbsp;a prose work in Italian, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Piramo e Tisbe</span><span class="font2"> (Milan, s.a.).

<p><span class="font1">The Enchanter Virgil.—After turning the heroes of antiquity into knights-errant, it was a simple task to transform ancient poets&nbsp;and philosophers into necromancers ; and Virgil and Aristotle became popularly famous, not for poetry and science, but for their&nbsp;supposed knowledge of the black art. One of the earliest references&nbsp;to the magical skill of Virgil@@<sup>2</sup> occurs in a letter of the chancellor&nbsp;Conrad (1194), reproduced by Arnold of Lübeck in the continuation of the Clιroηican Slavorum of Helmold. John of Salisbury&nbsp;alludes to the brazen fly fabricated by Virgil ; Hélinand (d. 1227)&nbsp;speaks of similar marvels in a work from which Vincentius Bellovacensis has borrowed ; and Gervase of Tilbury, in his Οtia Imperial™, (1212), and Alexander Neckham (d. 1217), in De Natura&nbsp;Rerum, have reproduced these traditions, with additions. German&nbsp;and French poets did not overlook this accessory to their répertoire. The Roman de Cléomades of Adenez (12th century) and the&nbsp;Image du Monde, an encyclopædic poem of Gauthier de Metz (13th&nbsp;century), contain numerous references to the prodigies of the enchanter. Reynard the Fox informs King Lion that he had from&nbsp;the wise Virgil a quantity of valuable receipts. He also plays a&nbsp;considerable part in the popular folk-tale The Seven Wise Masters,&nbsp;and appears in the Gesta Romanorum and that curious guidebook for pilgrims, the Mirabilia Romæ. He is to be found in&nbsp;Gower’s Confessio Amantis and in Lydgate’s Rochas. A Spanish&nbsp;romance, Vergilios, is included by E. de Ochoa in his Tesσro (Paris,&nbsp;1838), and Juan Ruiz, archpriest of Hita (d. 1351), has also written&nbsp;a poem on the subject. Many of the tales of magic throughout&nbsp;Europe were referred to Virgil, and gradually developed into a&nbsp;completely new life, strangely different from that of the real hero.&nbsp;They were collected in French under the title of Les Faitz Merveilleux de Virgille (c. 1499), a quarto chapbook of ten pages, which&nbsp;became extremely popular, and was printed, with more or less&nbsp;additional matter, in all languages. We are told how Virgil beguiled the devil at a very early age, in the same fashion as the&nbsp;fisherman used the jinn in the Arabian Nights when he got him&nbsp;to re-enter Solomon’s casket. Another reproduction of a widely&nbsp;spread tale was that of the lady who kept Virgil suspended in a&nbsp;basket. To revenge the affront the magician extinguished all the&nbsp;fires in the city, and no one could rekindle them without subjecting the lady to an ordeal highly offensive to her modesty. Virgil&nbsp;made for the emperor a castle in which he could see and hear everything done or said in Rome, an ever-blooming orchard, statues to&nbsp;preserve the safety of the city, and a lamp to supply light to it.&nbsp;He abducted the soldan’s daughter, and built for her the city of&nbsp;Naples upon a secure foundation of eggs. At last, having performed&nbsp;many extraordinary things, he knew that his time was come. In&nbsp;order to escape the common lot he placed all his treasures in a&nbsp;castle defended by images unceasingly wielding iron flails, and&nbsp;directed his confidential servant to hew him in pieces, which he&nbsp;was to salt and place in a barrel in the cellar, under which a&nbsp;lamp was to be kept burning. The servant was assured that after&nbsp;seven days his master would revive a young man. The directions&nbsp;were carried out ; but the emperor, missing his medicine - man,&nbsp;forced the servant to divulge the secret and to quiet the whirling&nbsp;flails. The emperor and his retinue entered the castle and at last&nbsp;found the mangled corpse. In his wrath he slew the servant,&nbsp;whereupon a little naked child ran thrice round the barrel, crying,&nbsp;“Cursed be the hour that ye ever came here,” and vanished.</span></p>
