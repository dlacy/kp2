<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Thia is an </span><span class="font2">abundantly ſimple formula ; but if we introduce it in our calculations of the reſiftances of curvilineal prows, it renders them ſo complicated as to be al-moft uſeleſs ; and what is worſe, when the calculation is completed for a curvilineal prow, the reſiſiance which&nbsp;refults is found to differ widely from experiment. This&nbsp;ſhows that the motion of the fluid is ſo modified by&nbsp;the action of the moft prominent part of the prow, that&nbsp;its impulſe on what ſucceeds is greatly affected, fo that&nbsp;we are not allowed to conſider the prow as compoſed of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font2">number of parts, each of which is affected as if it were&nbsp;detached from all the reft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the very nature of naval architecture ſeems to require curvilineal forms, in order to give the neceffary ſtrength, it ſeemed of importance to examine more particulary the deviations of the reſiftances of ſuch prows .&nbsp;from the refiſtances affigned by the theory. The academicians therefore made veffels with prows of a cylindrical ſhape ; one of theſe was a half cylinder, and the&nbsp;other was one-third of a cylinder, both having the ſame&nbsp;breadth, viz. two feet, the ſame depth, alſo two feet,&nbsp;and the ſame length, four feet. The reſiſtance of the&nbsp;half cylinder was to the reſiſtance of the perpendicular prow in the proportion of 13 to 25, inſtead of&nbsp;being as 13 to 19,5. The Chevalier Borda found&nbsp;nearly the ſame ratio oſ the refiſtances of the half cylin-der, and its diametrical plane when moved in air. He&nbsp;alſo compared the reſiſtances of two priſms or wedges,&nbsp;of the ſame breadth and 'height. The ſirſt had its ſides&nbsp;plane, inclined to the baſe in angles of 60°; the ſecond&nbsp;had its ſides portions oſ cylinders, of which the planes&nbsp;were the chords, that is, their ſections were arches of&nbsp;circles of 60<sup>,</sup>. Their reſiſtances were as 133 to 100,&nbsp;inſtead of being as 133 to 220, as required by the theory ; and as the reſiſtance of the ſirſt was greater in proportion to that of the baſe than the theory allows, the&nbsp;reſiſtance of the laſt was leſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Mr Robins found the reſiſtance of a ſphere moving in air to be to the refiſtance of its great circle as 1 to&nbsp;2,27 ; whereas theory requires them to be as </span><span class="font0">I </span><span class="font2">to 2.&nbsp;He found, at the fame time, that the abſolute refiſtance&nbsp;was greater than the weight of a cylinder of air of the&nbsp;ſame diameter, and having the height neceffary for acquiring the velocity. It was greater in the proportion&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">•of </span><span class="font2">49 to 40 nearly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Borda found the rcfiſtance of the ſphere moving in water to be to that of its great circle as 1000 to&nbsp;2508, and it was one-ninth greater than the weight of&nbsp;the column of water whoſe height was that neceffary&nbsp;for producing the velocity. He alſo found the refiſt-smee of air to the ſphere was to its reſiſtance to its great&nbsp;circle as 1 to 2,45.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It appears, on the whole, that the theory gives the refiſtance of oblique plane ſurfaces too ſmall, and that&nbsp;of curved ſurfaces too great ; and that it is quite unfit&nbsp;for afcertaining the modifications of reſiſtance arifing&nbsp;from the figure of the body. The moſt prominent&nbsp;part of the prow changes the action of the fluid on the&nbsp;ſucceeding parts, rendering it totally different from what&nbsp;it would be were that part detached from the reſt, and&nbsp;expofed to the ſtream with the ſame obliquity. It is&nbsp;of no conſequence, therefore, to deduce any formula&nbsp;from the valuable experiments of the French academy.&nbsp;The experiments themſelves are of great importance,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">jjecauſe </span><span class="font2">they give us the impulſes on plane ſurfaces with</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">every obliquity. They therefore put it </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in our power </span><span class="font2">to ſelect the moſt proper obliquity in a thouſand im-portant caſes. By appealing to them, we can tell what&nbsp;is the proper angle of the ſail for producing the great-eſt impnlſe in the direction of the ſhip’s courſe ; or the&nbsp;beſt inclination of the ſail of a wind-mill, or the beſt in-clination of the float of a water-wheel, &amp;c. &amp;c. Theſe&nbsp;deductions will be made in their proper places in the&nbsp;courſc of this work, we ſee alſo, that the deviation&nbsp;from the ſrmple theory is not very confiderable till the&nbsp;obliquity is great ; and that, in the inclinations which&nbsp;other circumſtances would induce us to give to the&nbsp;floats of water-wheels, the fails of wind-mills, and the&nbsp;like, the reſults of the theory are ſuſſiciently agreeable&nbsp;to experiment, for rendering this theory of very great&nbsp;uſe in the conſtruction of machines. Its great défect&nbsp;is in the impulſions on curved ſurſaces, which puts a&nbsp;ſtop to our improvement of the ſcience of naval arcħi-lecture, and the working of ſhips.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But it is not enough to detect the ſaults oſ this theo-ry : we ſhould try to amend it, or to ſubſtitute ano-ther. It is a pity that ſo much ingenuity ſhould have been thrown away in the application of a theory ſo defective. Mathematicians were ſeduced, as has been al-ready obſerved, by the opportunity which it gave for&nbsp;exercifing their calculus, which was a new thing at the&nbsp;time of publiſhing this theory. Newton ſaw clearly&nbsp;the defects of it, and makes no uie of any part of it&nbsp;in his ſubſequent diſcuſſions, and plainly has uſed it&nbsp;merely as an introduction, in order to give ſome gene-ral notions in a ſnbject quite new, and to give a demon*&nbsp;ſtration of one leading truth, viz. the proportion<sup>-</sup>ility of&nbsp;the impulfions to the ſquares of the velocities, while we&nbsp;proſeſs the higheſt reſpect for the talents and labours&nbsp;of the great mathematicians who have followed New-ton in this moſt difficult refearch, we cannot help being&nbsp;ſorry that ſome of the greateſt of them continued to&nbsp;attach themſelves to a theory which he neglected, mere-ly becauſe it afforded an opportunity of diſplaying their&nbsp;profound knowledge of the new calculus, of which they&nbsp;were willing to afcribe the diſcovery to Leibnitz. It&nbsp;has been in a great meaſure owing to this that we have&nbsp;been ſo late in diſcovering our ignorance of the ſubject. Newton had himſelf pointed out all the defects&nbsp;of this theory ; and he ſet himſelf to work to diſcover&nbsp;another which ſholftd be more conformable to the nature of things, retaining only ſuch deductions ſrom the&nbsp;other as his great ſagacity affured him would ſtand the&nbsp;teſt oſ experiment. Even in this he ſeems to have been&nbsp;miſtaken by his followers. He retained the proportionality of the reſiſtance to the ſquare oſ the velocity.&nbsp;This they have endeavoured to demonſtrate in a manner conformable to Newton’s determination of the&nbsp;oblique impulſes of fluids ; and under the cover of the&nbsp;agreement of this propoſition with experiment, they in*&nbsp;troduced into mechanics a mode of expreffion, and even&nbsp;oſ conception, which is inconſiſtent with all accurate&nbsp;notions on theſc ſubjects. Newton’s propofition was,&nbsp;that the motions communicated to the fluid, and therefore the motions loſt by the body, in equal times, were&nbsp;as the ſquares of the velocities ; and he conceived theſe&nbsp;as proper meaſures of the reſiſtances. It is a matter of&nbsp;experience, that the forces or preſſures by which a body&nbsp;muſt be ſupported in oppoiition to the impulſes of&nbsp;fluids, are in this very proportion.
