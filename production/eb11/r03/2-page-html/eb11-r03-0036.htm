<p><span class="font1">sandstone and iron structure, carrying both railway and road, and replacing the one carried away by floods in 1875. The&nbsp;town contains two Evangelical churches, a castle, formerly a&nbsp;convent and now used as a town hall, and several schools.&nbsp;There is a harbour with quays and a dockyard, also rolling-mills and saw-mills, ironworks and sandstone quarries. Other&nbsp;industries are the manufacture of furniture, beer, soap, carriages&nbsp;and bricks. The most important shipping station on the Elbe&nbsp;in Saxony, Riesa is the lading-place for goods to and from&nbsp;Bavaria, and a mart for herrings, petroleum, wood, coal and&nbsp;grain. A constant passenger steamboat communication is&nbsp;maintained with Meissen and Dresden; and, owing to the&nbsp;artillery practice ranges at Zeithain, on the right bank of the&nbsp;Elbe, Riesa has become of recent years one of the chief depots&nbsp;of the Saxon army. Riesa received municipal rights in 1632,&nbsp;and after a period of decay was again raised to the rank of&nbsp;a town in 1859.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIESENER, JEAN HENRI (1734-1806), French cabinet-maker of the Louis XVI. period, was born at Gladbach near Cologne.&nbsp;At an early age he went to Paris, where he entered the workshop&nbsp;in the Arsenal of Jean François Oeben </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> When that great&nbsp;master died, Riesener became foreman of the works; two years&nbsp;later he married Mme. Oeben, and in 1768 was admitted “ maître-menuisier-ébéniste.” His wife died in 1776, andin 1782 he&nbsp;espoused, as his second wife, AnneGrezeljdaughter of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bourgeois&nbsp;of</span><span class="font1"> Paris. The union was unhappy, and when, under the first&nbsp;Republic, divorce was legalized, the marriage was dissolved.&nbsp;When Riesener contracted his first marriage he possessed little&nbsp;or nothing; his second contract of marriage recited that in cash&nbsp;and in the money due to him by Louis XVI. he was worth more&nbsp;than £20,000, without counting the finished work in hand, bronze&nbsp;models, jewels and personal effects and invested funds. Thus in&nbsp;Afteenyearshehadaccumulatedafortuneamouutinginallto about&nbsp;£40,000. By that time there had been conferred upon him the&nbsp;title, formerly enjoyed by Oeben, of “ Ébéniste du Roi.” He died&nbsp;on the 6th of January 1806, in the Enclos des Jacobins, leaving&nbsp;an only son, Henri François (1767-1828), a distinguished portrait-painter of the First Empire. Riesener was unquestionably the&nbsp;greatest of the Louis Seize cabinet-makers. His name is stamped&nbsp;upon the Bureau du Roi in the Louvre, and although the original&nbsp;conception of that master-work was due to Oeben, it cannot be&nbsp;doubted that its consummate finish and perfect achievement&nbsp;must in great measure be attributed to the man who completed&nbsp;it. Occasionally there may, perhaps, be some lack of spontaneity in his forms, but his work is generally at once bold and&nbsp;graceful. His marquetry presents an extraordinary finish; his&nbsp;chiselled bronzes are of the first excellence. He was especially&nbsp;distinguished for his cabinets, in which he employed many&nbsp;European as well as exotic woods. Wreaths and bunches of&nbsp;flowers form the centres of the panels; on the sides are often&nbsp;diaper patterns in quiet colours. Yet despite his distinction as&nbsp;a maker of cabinets his high-water mark was reached in the&nbsp;Bureau du Roi, finished in 1769 and consequently belonging&nbsp;rather to the Louis Quinze than the Louis Seize period, and&nbsp;a not altogether dissimilar cylinder bureau believed to have&nbsp;been made for Stanislas Leszczynski, king of Poland, now in the&nbsp;Wallace Collection. Stanislas died in 1766, but the desk was not&nbsp;completed until February 20,1769, as appears by the inscription&nbsp;accompanying the maker’s signature. Upon its completion it&nbsp;passed into the possession of the French crown and was included&nbsp;in a sale of the royal furniture which took place in Holland. It&nbsp;was purchased by Sir William Hamilton, then British Minister&nbsp;at the Hague, and appears to have passéd out of his hands when&nbsp;he left Naples, where it was purchased by Sir Richard Wallace.&nbsp;At Buckingham Palace there is a third bureau on the same lines.&nbsp;These pieces are triumphs of marquetry. They are inlaid with&nbsp;trophies of musical instruments, doves, bouquets and garlands of&nbsp;flowers; the bronze vascs and “galleries” are exquisite—they&nbsp;may possibly be the work of Gouthiere, but are more probably&nbsp;from the hands of Duplessis. For several years this great artist&nbsp;appears to have used the models of his master Oeben, but there&nbsp;was a gradual transition to a style more individual, more&nbsp;delicately conceived, with finer but hardly less vigorous lines.&nbsp;By the time he had been working alone for ten years he had&nbsp;completely embraced the Louis Seize manner—he had, perhaps,&nbsp;some responsibility for it. One of the most distinguished of his&nbsp;achievements for the court was the famous flat writing-table&nbsp;now at the Petit Trianon, for which he received only £200. The&nbsp;extent of these royal orders may be gauged from the fact that&nbsp;between 1775 and 1785 Riesener received 500,000 livres from&nbsp;the Garde Meubles, notwithstanding that during the whole of this&nbsp;period Gondouin the architect was the official designer of furniture&nbsp;for the royal palaces. Like so many other artists he was condemned in the end to sacrifice to the false taste of his day,&nbsp;and a certain number of his creations, otherwise delightful,&nbsp;were vitiated by being mounted with panels of Sèvres, Wedgwood and other china. The beautiful little secretaire in the&nbsp;Jones collection in the Victoria and Albert Museum suffers&nbsp;seriously by this lapse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RIESENGEBIRGE (Bohemian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Krkonose),</span><span class="font1"> or Giant Mountains, a lofty and rugged group on the boundary of Silesia and Bohemia, between the upper courses of the Elbe and the Oder.&nbsp;They form the highest portion of the Sndetic system which&nbsp;separates south-east Prussia from the Austrian empire, and&nbsp;finds its natural continuation towards the N.W. in the Erzgebirge, the Thuringian Forest and the Harz Mountains.&nbsp;Adjoining the Isergebirge and the Lausitzergebirge on the&nbsp;W., and the Eulengebirge and the Adlergebirge on the E. and&nbsp;S.E., the Riesengebirge proper run S.E. and N.W. between the&nbsp;sources of the Zacken and the Bober, for a distance of 23 m.,&nbsp;with a breadth of 14 m. They cover an area of about 425 sq. m.,&nbsp;three-fourths of which is in Austrian, and the remainder in&nbsp;Prussian territory. The boundary line follows the crest of the&nbsp;principal chain or ridge (Riesenkamm), which stretches along&nbsp;the northern side of the group, with an average height of over&nbsp;4000 ft. The principal peaks are the Reifträger (4430 ft.), the&nbsp;Hohe Rad (4968 ft.), the Great Sturmhaube (4862 ft.), the Little&nbsp;Sturmhaube (4646 ft.), and, near the east extremity, the&nbsp;Schneekoppe or Riesenkoppe (5266 ft.), the loftiest mountain&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">northern or central Germany. Roughly parallel to this&nbsp;northern ridge, and separated from it by a long narrow valley&nbsp;known as the Siebengründe, there extends on the S. a second and&nbsp;lower chain, of broad massive “ saddles,” with comparatively&nbsp;few peaks. The chief heights here are Kesselkoppe (4708 ft.),&nbsp;the Krkonose (4849 ft.), the Ziegenrücken and the Brunnenberg (5072 ft.). From both ridges spurs of greater or less length&nbsp;are sent off at various angles, whence a magnificent view is&nbsp;obtained from Breslau to Prague; the lowlands of Silesia,&nbsp;watered by the Oder, and those of Bohemia, intersected by the&nbsp;Elbe and the Moldau, appearing to lie mapped in relief. The&nbsp;summit is crowned by a chapel dedicated to St Lawrence, which&nbsp;once also served as a traveller’s shelter. Since 1850 the chapel&nbsp;has been restored to its religious use, and a hotel for the accommodation of tourists is built close by. A remarkable group of&nbsp;isolated columnar rocks are those known as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adersbacher&nbsp;Felsen</span><span class="font1"> in a valley on the Bohemian side of the Riesengebirge,&nbsp;9 m. W.N.W. of Braunau.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On its northern side this mountain group rises ruggedly and precipitously from the Hirschberg valley; but on its southern&nbsp;side its slope towards Bohemia is very much more gradual.&nbsp;The scenery is in general bold and wild. The Bohemian ridge&nbsp;is cleft about the middle by a deep gorge through which pour&nbsp;the headwaters of the river Elbe, which finds its source in the&nbsp;Siebengründe. The Iser, Bober, Aupa, Zacken, Queiss, and a&nbsp;great number of smaller streams also rise among these mountains&nbsp;or on their skirts; and small lakes and tarns are not unfrequent&nbsp;in the valleys. The Great and Little Schneegruben—two deep&nbsp;rocky gorge-like valleys in which snow remains all the year&nbsp;round—lie to the north of the Hohe Rad.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nearly the whole of the Riesenkamm and the western portion of the southern chain are granite; the eastern extremity of the&nbsp;main ridge and several mountains to the south-east are formed of a&nbsp;species of gneiss; and the greater part of the Bohemian chain,&nbsp;especially its summits, consists of mica-slate. Blocks of these&nbsp;minerals lie scattered on the sides and ridges of the mountains and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
