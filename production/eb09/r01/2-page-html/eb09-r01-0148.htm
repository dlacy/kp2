<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">being subdivided into classes, while the mode of government was nearly identical with that known as Presbyterian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In England the reformation of doctrine made but little progress during the reign of Henry VIII., for, although&nbsp;by the Ten Articles </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1536) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the royal assent was given to&nbsp;the adoption of the doctrine of justification by faith and&nbsp;to the recognition of the Bible and the three ancient creeds&nbsp;as the standard of belief, a marked reaction in favour of&nbsp;Catholic doctrine took place in the enactment of the Six&nbsp;Articles in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1539. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">For a brief period heresy became a&nbsp;statutable offence and death was inflicted under the new&nbsp;provisions. The anomalous position of the English Church&nbsp;became a scandal to Europe; for, while some men were&nbsp;burnt for denying the doctrine of transubstantiation or&nbsp;for refusing to admit the royal supremacy, others, as&nbsp;Barnes and Gerard, suffered at the stake for their profession of Lutheran opinions, and even Cromwell must be&nbsp;regarded as in some measure a victim of his attachment&nbsp;to German Protestantism. During the reign of Edward&nbsp;VI. Somerset in conjunction with Cranmer pressed on the&nbsp;work of the Reformation apace. Chantries and hospitals&nbsp;were everywhere suppressed and their endowments confiscated. The bishops were compelled to acknowledge their&nbsp;direct subordination to the crown by being required to&nbsp;take out licences for the exercise of their jurisdiction. In&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1549 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the first Book of Common Prayer was published,&nbsp;and the Act of Uniformity prescribed its use, while that&nbsp;of all other forms of devotion was forbidden under heavy&nbsp;penalties. The canon law was revised by a body of commissioners specially appointed for the purpose, and the&nbsp;new code was completed for future use, although it never&nbsp;received the young king’s signature. By these and other&nbsp;similar reforms, carried out in a great measure under&nbsp;Cranmer’s direction, it was sought to make the Reformation in England a complete rejoinder to the proceedings&nbsp;of the council assembled at Trent.</span></p><h6><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In Scotland the Reformation assumed a different character from that of the movement in England. It was inspired directly and solely by Germany, and may be&nbsp;regarded as commencing from the martyrdom of Patrick&nbsp;Hamilton in the year </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">1528, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">there being no evidence of&nbsp;any prior spontaneous efforts in the direction of doctrinal&nbsp;reform on the part of the people. Hamilton’s designs&nbsp;were looked upon with the greatest disfavour by the clergy&nbsp;at large; and, as James Y. was especially anxious to secure&nbsp;the support of that body in his conflict with his insubordinate nobility, he was altogether opposed to the adoption of the Lutheran tenets. He even aspired to succeed&nbsp;to the title, which Henry had forfeited, of “ Defender of&nbsp;the Faith,” and was encouraged to hope that he might&nbsp;succeed to the English crown. After his death </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1542),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">however, under the regency of the earl of Arran, the&nbsp;Reformed doctrines began to be regarded with greater&nbsp;favour at court, while the merciless policy of Cardinal&nbsp;Beaton and the cruel fate of Wishart gave rise to an outburst of popular indignation against the bishops to which&nbsp;Beaton himself fell a victim </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1546). </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The country was&nbsp;now divided into two parties,—the bishops, the clergy at&nbsp;large, and the powerful influence of France (as represented&nbsp;by the Guises) being on the side of Catholicism, while&nbsp;many of the chief nobles and the laity at large were&nbsp;inclined to favour Protestantism. The English influence,&nbsp;which, wisely exerted, might have operated powerfully on&nbsp;the same side, was, however, sacrificed by the injudicious&nbsp;policy of Somerset, who by his endeavour to enforce the&nbsp;marriage of Mary Stuart with the youthful Edward roused&nbsp;the national spirit. The sense of humiliation and resentment which followed upon the battle of Pinkie </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1547),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">where the English were greeted by the Scottish soldiery&nbsp;with the cry of “heretics,” produced a reaction in favour&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">of Catholicism which was not arrested until the return of&nbsp;John Knox in 1555 from the Continent (see Knox).</span></h6>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In Ireland the circumstances which favoured the introduction of Protestantism in England were altogether wanting. The Roman ritual was in harmony with the&nbsp;genius of the people, whereas the aversion naturally inspired&nbsp;by a creed imposed at the dictation of the conqueror was&nbsp;in itself a formidable obstacle. The harsh and essentially&nbsp;un-Christian policy pursued by the constituted ecclesiastical&nbsp;authorities presented further difficulties. The Bible was&nbsp;not translated into the vernacular, and that idiom was&nbsp;equally ignored in the church services, ■where the choice&nbsp;lay between the Latin, hallowed in the minds of the people&nbsp;by immemorial usage, and the language of the oppressor.&nbsp;Notwithstanding, if the native population failed to attend&nbsp;the English Church services they were fined. Other&nbsp;abuses similar to those which had contributed so powerfully to render Germany Protestant,—non-residence on the&nbsp;part of the clergy, the bestowal of benefices on needy&nbsp;aliens, often altogether wanting in religious earnestness,&nbsp;and sometimes indifferent to the observance of ordinary&nbsp;morality,—still further intensified the feeling of alienation.&nbsp;Protestantism became odious in the eyes of the Irish&nbsp;people; and, when, after long years of oppression and&nbsp;neglect, it was sought to inaugurate a juster policy and&nbsp;to render the established church in some degree really&nbsp;national, the obstacles thus created could not be overcome.</span></p>
