<p><span class="font2">RASTALL (John), a printer and mifcellaneous writer, was born in London, probably about the end of&nbsp;the 15tl1 century, and educated at oxford. Returning&nbsp;from the univerſity, he fettled in the metropolis, and&nbsp;commenced printer, “ then eſteemed (ſays wood) a&nbsp;profeſſion fit tor any fcholar or ingenious man.” He&nbsp;married the filter of Sir Thomas More, with whom, we&nbsp;are told, he was very intimate, and whofe writings he&nbsp;ſtrenuouſly defended. From the title-page of one of&nbsp;his books, he appears to have lived in Cheapſide, at the&nbsp;ſign of the mermaid. He died in the year 1536 ; aud&nbsp;leſt two ſons, william and John : the ſirſt of whom became a judge in queen Mary’s reign, and the latter a&nbsp;juſkce of peace. This John Raſtall, the fubject of the&nbsp;preſent article, was a zealous Papiſt ; but Bale ſays,&nbsp;that he changed his religion before his death.

<p><span class="font0">RAT, in zoology. See Mus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The following receipt is ſaid to have been found ef-• fectual for the deſtruction of rats. Take of the feeds of ſtavefacre or loufewort, powdered, more or leſs as the&nbsp;occaſion requires, one part ; of oat-meal, three parts ;&nbsp;mix them well, and make them up into a paſte with honey. Lay pieces of ſt in the holes, and on the places&nbsp;where mice and rats frequent ; and it will effectually&nbsp;kill or rid the place of thoſe kind of vermin by their&nbsp;eating thereof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some time ago, the ſociety for encouraging arts pro-pofed a premium of 50l. for a preparation capable of alluring or faſcinating rats ſo that they might be taken&nbsp;ahve. In conſequence of this, a great number of new’&nbsp;traps, &amp;c. were invented ; and the following methods of&nbsp;alluring the rats to a certain place were publiſhed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Θne of thoſe moſt eaſily and efficaciouſly practiſed is the trailing ſome pieces of their moſt favourite food,&nbsp;which ſhould be of the kind that has the ſtrongeſt ſcent,&nbsp;ſuch as toaſted cheeſe or broiled red herrings, from thc&nbsp;holes or entrances of the cloſet to their receſſes in every&nbsp;part of the houſe or contiguous building. At the extremities and in different parts of the courfe of this trailed track, ſmall quantities oſ meal, or any other kind,&nbsp;of their food, ſhould be laid, to bring the greater number into the tracks, and to encourage them to purſue&nbsp;it to the place where they are intended to be taken : at&nbsp;that place, when time admits oſ it, a more plentiful repail is laid for them, and the trailing repeated for two&nbsp;or three nights.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Beſides this trailing and way-baiting, fome of the moſt expert of the rat-catchers have a ſhorter and per-haps more effectual method of bringing them together;&nbsp;which is the calling them, by making ſuch a whiffling&nbsp;node as reſembles their own call ; and by this means,&nbsp;with the aſſiſtance of the way-baits, they call them out&nbsp;of their holes, and lead them to the repaſt prepared for&nbsp;them at the place deſigned for taking them. But this&nbsp;is much more difficult to be practiſed than the art of&nbsp;trailing ; for the learning the exact notes or cries of&nbsp;any kind oſ beaſts or birds, fo as to deceive them, is a&nbsp;peculiar talent which is ſeldom attained : though fome&nbsp;perfons have been known who could call tog-ether a&nbsp;great number of cats ; and there was a man in London&nbsp;who.could bring nightingales, when they were within&nbsp;hearing, about him, and even allure them to perch on&nbsp;his hand, lo as to be taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In practiſing either of thoſe methods, of trailing or calling, great caution muſt be uled by the operator to&nbsp;ſupprefs and prevent the fcent of his feet and body from&nbsp;being perceived ; which is done by overpowering that&nbsp;ſcent by others of a ſtronger nature. In order to this,&nbsp;the feet are to be covered with cloths rubbed over with&nbsp;afafiaetida, or other ſtrong-ſmelling fubſtances ; and even&nbsp;oil of rhodium is fometimes uſed for this purpoſe, but&nbsp;ſparingly, on account </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">fits dearneſs, .though it has a&nbsp;very alluring as well as diſguiling effect. If this caution of avoiding the ſcent of the operator’s feet, near&nbsp;the tιack, and in the place where the rats are propoſed&nbsp;to be collected, be not properly obſerved, it will very&nbsp;much obſtruct the ſucceſs of the attempt to take them ;&nbsp;for they are very ſhy of coming where the ſcent of human feet lies very freſh, as it intimates to their ſagaci-υus inſtinct the preſence of human creatures, whom they</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
