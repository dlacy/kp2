a conſiderable town of France, in Anjou, and capital of the Saumarois, with an ancient caſtle. The town is ſmall, but pleaſantly ſituated on the Loire, acroſs which is a long bridge, continued through a number of iſlands. Saumur was anciently a moſt important pals over the river, and of conſequence was frequently and fiercely diſputed by either party, during the civil ware of France in the ſixteenth century. The fortifications are of great ſtrength, and Henry the Fourth, on the reconciliation which took place between him and Henry the Third, near Tours, in 1589, demanded that Saumur ſhould be delivered to him, as one of the cities of ſafety. The caſtle overlooks the town and river. It is built on a lofty eminence, and has a venerable and magnificent appearance, and was lately uſed as a priſon of ſtate, where perſons of rank were frequently confined. The Kings of Sicily, and Dukes of Anjou of the houſe of Valois, who deſcended from John king of France, often reſided in the caſtle of Saumur, as it conſtituted a part of their Angevin dominions. E. Long. O. 2. N. Lat. 47. 15.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
