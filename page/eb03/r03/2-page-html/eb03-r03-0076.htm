<p><span class="font1">RUDDIMAN (Thomas), one of the moſt eminent grammarians which Scotland has produced, was born&nbsp;in October 1674 at Raggel, in the pariſh of Boyndie&nbsp;and county of Banff. His father James Ruddiman&nbsp;was a farmer, and ſtrongly attached to the houſe of&nbsp;Stuart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mr Ruddiman was inſtructed in the principles oſ Latin grammar at the pariſh-ſchool of Boyndie, where his application was fo vigorous, and his progreſs ſo rapid,&nbsp;that he quickly ſurpaſſed all his claſs-fellows. Hi«&nbsp;maſter George Moriſon, who was a ſkilful and attentive&nbsp;teacher, being unwilling to check his ardour for learning, permitted him to follow the impulſe oſ his genius,&nbsp;•and to advance without waiting the flow progreſs of&nbsp;the other boys.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The pleaſure which the youthful mind receives from vivid deſcription, though wild and romantic, approaches&nbsp;to ecſtacy, and often makes an impreſſion which remains&nbsp;indelible. While at ſchool, the firſt book which charm</span><span class="font0">ed </span><span class="font1">the opening mind of Ruddiman was Ovid’s Meta-morphoſes ; nor did he ceaſe to reliſh the beauties of&nbsp;this author when his judgment was mature, for during&nbsp;the reſt of his life Ovid was his favourite poet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">At the age of ſixteen he became anxious to purſue his ſtudies at the univerſity ; but his father thinking&nbsp;him too young, oppoſed his inclination. Hearing of&nbsp;the competition trial, which was annually held at King’s&nbsp;College, Aberdeen, for a certain number of burſaries on&nbsp;the foundation of that univerſity, Ruddiman’s ambition&nbsp;was kindled. Without the knowledge of luε father,&nbsp;and with only a ſingle guinea in his pocket, which his&nbsp;fiſter had privately given him, he ſet out ſor that place.&nbsp;On the road he was met by a company of gypſeys,&nbsp;who robbed him of his coat, his ſhoes, his ſtcckings,&nbsp;and his guinea. This misfortune did not damp his en-terpriſing ſpirit : He continued his journey to Aberdeen, preſented himſelf before the profeffors as a candidate ; and though he had neither clothes to give him a&nbsp;decent appearance nor friendβ to recommend him, he&nbsp;gained the firſt prize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After attending the univerſity four years, he obtained the degree of maſter of arts ; an honour of which he was always proud. The theſis ſays, the diſputation on&nbsp;this occaſion laſted </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aurora uſque ad ve/perum,</span><span class="font2"> i. e,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ſrom morning till night.” Tho’ Ruddiman </span><span class="font2">was only </span><span class="font1">twenty year« of age when he left the university, it ap.&nbsp;pears from a book intitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhetomcorum Libri très,</span><span class="font1"> com-poſed before this period, but never publiſhed, that he&nbsp;had then read the Roman claſſics with uncommon attention and advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He was. ſoon after engaged as a tutor to the ſon of Robert Young, Eſq; of Auldbar, the great grandſon of&nbsp;Sir Peter Young, who under the direction of Buchanan had been preceptor of James Vi. His income&nbsp;here muſt have been very ſmall, or his ſituation unplea-ſant ; for within a year be accepted the office of ſchoolmaſter in the pariſh of Laurence-kirk The proſeſſion&nbsp;of ſchoolmaſter in a country-pariſh at that period could,&nbsp;open no field ſor ambition, nor proſpect of great emolument; for by an act of parliament paſſed in 1633<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>the ſalary appropriated to this office could not be increaſed above 200 merks Scots, or L. 1 1 : 2 : 2∣∙ Sterling. In diſcharging the duties of this humble but important ſtation, it is probable that he uſed Simfon<sup>,</sup>⅜&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rudimenta Grammati&lt;a,</span><span class="font1"> which was then generally taught&nbsp;in the northern ſchools, and by which he himſelf had&nbsp;been inſtructed in the principles of Latin grammar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Ruddiman had ſpent three years and a half </span><span class="font2">in </span><span class="font1">this employment, the celebrated Dr Pitcairne happening to paſs through Laurence-kirk, was detained </span><span class="font2">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">that village by a violent ſtorm. Pitcairne wanting&nbsp;amuſement, inquired at the hoſteſs if ſhe could procure&nbsp;any agreeable companion to bear him company at dinner. She replied, that the ſchoolmaſter, though young,&nbsp;was ſaid to be learned, and, though modeſt, ſhe waδ&nbsp;fore could talk. Pitcairne was delighted with the con-verſation and learning of his new companion, invited&nbsp;him to Edinburgh, and promiſed him his patronage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Ruddiman arrived in Edinburgh, the advocates library, which had been founded eighteen years before by Sir George Mackenzie, attracted his curio-ſity and attention, and he was ſoon after appointed aſ-ſiſtant-keeper under Mr Spottiſwoode the principal librarian. His ſalary for executing this laborious office was&nbsp;L. 8 : 6 : 8. He had befides a ſmall honorary preſent&nbsp;from thoſe who were admitted advocates for correcting&nbsp;their theſes : he was alſo paid ſor copying manuſcripts&nbsp;for the uſe of the library. And the faculty, before hc&nbsp;had held the office two years, were ſo highly pleaſed&nbsp;with his conduct, that they made him a preſent of </span><span class="font2">50&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">pounds Scots, or L. 4 : 3 : 4 Sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the fitting of the court of ſeſſion he attended the library from ten till three. But this confinement&nbsp;did not prevent him from engaging in other laborious&nbsp;duties : A part of his time was occupied in teaching&nbsp;young gentlemen the Latin language. Some he attended at their lodgings, ſome waited upon him, and&nbsp;ſome reſided in his own houſe. An exact lift of the&nbsp;names of thoſe who attended him, expreſſing the date&nbsp;of their entry, and the ſums which he was to receive&nbsp;from each, has been found in his pocket-book ; a curious relick, which is ſtill preſerved.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When Ruddiman’s merit as ä ſeholar became better known, his aſſiſtance was anxiouſly ſolicited by thoſe&nbsp;who were engaged in literary publications. Freebairne,&nbsp;a reſpectable bookſeller of that period, prevailed upon&nbsp;him to correct and prepare , for the preſs Sir Robert&nbsp;Sibbald’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Introduttio ad hi/loriam rerum a Romanis gejla-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rum in eα Borealis Britannia </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">parte qua ultra murum</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
