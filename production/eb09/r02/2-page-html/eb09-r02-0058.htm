<p><span class="font1">heightened colours on an ampler canvas. “ The imagery is alive with the burning breath of the East ; a luxuriant&nbsp;fancy sacrifices beauty to boldness and sets proportion at&nbsp;defiance ; all that is sweet and human yields to all that is&nbsp;monstrous and repulsive. A flow of metaphors, an interminable personification of abstractions, animates these&nbsp;strange creations with the weird and awful life of some&nbsp;fantastic resurrection scene. At the same time none of the&nbsp;descriptions are clear and intelligible ; the outlines of the&nbsp;pictures melt and fade away in tremulous lines despite&nbsp;the coarseness of the material on which they are drawn.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2Ys Jesus Christ had promised to come again, the Jewish expectations of a Messiah who should be revealed&nbsp;continued unabated among many of His disciples ; that&nbsp;which as Jews they had hoped from the first and only&nbsp;advent they now deferred till the second. True, the&nbsp;kingdom of God which He had promised did not tally&nbsp;with the materialistic hopes of the people, but on the&nbsp;other hand He had not infrequently Himself employed the&nbsp;figurative language of the prophets and apocalyptic writers;&nbsp;and, after He had left the earth, many sayings borrowed&nbsp;from the Jewish apocalypses were put in His mouth by a&nbsp;vitiated tradition.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> In the expectations of Christians of&nbsp;the 1st century spiritual and material elements were&nbsp;strangely blent. Hence not only were the Jewish&nbsp;apocalypses, the genuineness of which no one doubted,&nbsp;read in the Christian communities and transmitted to the&nbsp;Gentile converts, but soon there appeared new apocalypses&nbsp;written by Christians. We cannot wonder at this, for all&nbsp;conditions favourable to the production of such writings&nbsp;were to be found in the churches also ; above all, men&nbsp;were conscious of possessing the spirit of prophecy in a&nbsp;far fuller measure than ever before, and this spirit&nbsp;necessarily manifested itself not only in signs and wonders&nbsp;but also in revelations and predictions. Of the Christian&nbsp;apocalypses written between 70 and 170 a.d. only a very&nbsp;small portion is known to us ; for the later church viewed&nbsp;them as dangerous and got rid of them. Even of the&nbsp;apocalypse of Peter, written in the 1st century and&nbsp;regarded as canonical in some provinces as late as the 3d,&nbsp;only a very few fragments have come down to us.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> But&nbsp;the great Apocalypse which bears the name of John has&nbsp;been preserved. It is to its reception into the canon that&nbsp;we owe the preservation of this precious, indeed unique,&nbsp;monument of the earliest Christian times.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Form, Contents, and Purpose.—</span><span class="font1">If we leave out of view chapters i. to iii. the Apocalypse of John does not differ very&nbsp;materially in form from the Jewish apocalypses ; but&nbsp;undoubtedly its arrangement is better, and its execution&nbsp;simpler and grander, and therefore more tasteful.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>3</sup> In its&nbsp;contents, however, the distinction between this Christian&nbsp;apocalypse and its Jewish fellows is marked; for, while&nbsp;the latter have not and could not have any actual knowledge of the Messiah whom they promise, the Apocalypse&nbsp;of John centres round the crucified and risen Jesus, the&nbsp;Lamb that was slain. The author knows whom he and&nbsp;the Christian community have to expect; to him Jesus&nbsp;Christ is the alpha and the omega, the first and the last ;&nbsp;he is the Lord of the world and of history. And this faith</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">gives to the Apocalypse of John a tone of assured confidence and hope such as is not to be found in the Jewish apocalypses. On the other hand, however firm and sure the&nbsp;Christian faith of the author appears, he was still completely hide-bound in the old forms ; it is really a case of&nbsp;new wine in old bottles. But this very circumstance&nbsp;gives to the book its peculiar charm, for in no other early&nbsp;Christian writing are new and old to be found so completely mingled as in this. The author’s attitude towards&nbsp;the world and the state is still entirely the Jewish attitude&nbsp;of surly hate—this disciple of the gospel has not yet&nbsp;learned that we are bound to love our enemies ; but his&nbsp;attitude towards God and his view of the value of a man’s&nbsp;own works show no longer the Jewish but the new&nbsp;Christian belief, for he sees God in Christ, he has accepted&nbsp;the doctrine of the forgiveness of sins through the blood of&nbsp;the Lamb, and regards himself as a priest and king before&nbsp;God. Hence too he lives and moves no longer in the law&nbsp;but in the prophets and the psalms. From them,&nbsp;especially from the prophets Ezekiel, Zechariah, and&nbsp;Daniel, he borrowed most of his imagery and symbols.&nbsp;What he has done in his book is to create a great apocalyptic painting or rather a drama worked out in different&nbsp;acts. Impatient longing for the end, a deep abhorrence&nbsp;of the heathen state, a firm faith in Christ and His second&nbsp;coming, a minute and painstaking study of the old&nbsp;prophecies—these are the sources from which the description of the future are drawn. The purpose is the same&nbsp;as that of all apocalypses—to confirm and strengthen the&nbsp;little family of believers in their patience, their courage,&nbsp;and their confidence, by pointing out that the sufferings&nbsp;of the time will last but a brief span and that the present&nbsp;troubles are already the beginning of that end when&nbsp;sorrow and suffering will in a moment be transformed into&nbsp;glory unspeakable.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The revelation proper begins with iv. 1,—the first three chapters forming an introduction (the seven letters to the seven&nbsp;churches of Asia Minor, which are prefixed, are marked by poetical beauty and power of language). The future is written in a&nbsp;book with seven seals, which the Lamb opens one after the other&nbsp;(iv., v.). The opening of each seal brings a plague upon the&nbsp;earth (vi. ). Before the seventh seal is opened, the church of the&nbsp;latter days is itself sealed that it may be preserved harmless from&nbsp;the assaults of the powers of hell (vii.). At the opening of the&nbsp;seventh seal seven angels with trumpets appear on the scene, each&nbsp;of whom blows a trumpet-blast as a prelude to new honors on the&nbsp;earth (viii., ix. ). With the sixth trumpet the preliminary judgments are at an end (hence the episode, ch. x. ). The judgment&nbsp;proper begins with the fall of Jerusalem (xi. ). Then the seventh&nbsp;trumpet sounds as the signal for the last dread horrors and for&nbsp;the final judgment of the world and of all wickedness. This is&nbsp;preceded, however, by a description of the preservation of the&nbsp;church of the latter days (xii.), forming one of those pauses in the&nbsp;narrative which give the reader breathing time and relieve the&nbsp;horror of the description by the introduction of scenes of peace&nbsp;and words of comfort. The power of the world that opposes&nbsp;Christ (the Roman empire) is described along with all its devilish&nbsp;accomplices (xiii.), and (xiv.) its destruction is by anticipation set&nbsp;forth in figures. The seven angels follow with the seven vials of&nbsp;wrath, which are poured forth and represent the beginning of the&nbsp;final catastrophe (xv., xyi. ). This final catastrophe, involving the&nbsp;imperial city, </span><span class="font1">thθ </span><span class="font0">antichristian emperor, his governors, and, last&nbsp;of all, the devil himself, is described in xvii.-xx. 3,—xix. 11 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sq.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">forming the climax, when Christ himself appears on a white horse&nbsp;and vanquishes all his foes. The devil is chained in the bottomless pit for a thousand years ; during this time the saints of the&nbsp;latter days—not all believers—reign with Christ.@@<sup>5</sup> After the devil</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The literary value of the Apocalypse of John is much higher than&nbsp;that of any of the Jewish apocalypses. The author possessed the&nbsp;art of keeping his readers enthralled and excited from first to last ; by&nbsp;a suitable arrangement he has really reduced his motley material to&nbsp;order, and by skilful description he has contrived to make even the&nbsp;repulsive endurable.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>4</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way in which the author has given expression to this practical&nbsp;purpose by means of scenes and images reveals the great artist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>5</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This idea, germs of which are to be found in the Jewish apocalypses, is easily explained when we remember that two different&nbsp;views of the resurrection and of the future kingdom prevailed amongst&nbsp;the Jews. According to the one view only favoured persons, according to the other every one would rise from the dead ; according to&nbsp;the one view the future kingdom would have only a limited duration,&nbsp;according to the other it wou<sup>,</sup>d be eternal. In the Revelation of John&nbsp;the two suppositions are combined.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
