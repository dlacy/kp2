<p><label>RATISBON</label>
an ancient, large, rich, handfome, and ſtrong city of Germany, in Bavaria, free and imperial, with a biſhop’s fee, whoſe biſhop is a prince of the empire, lt is called by the Germans Regenſhurg, from the river Regens, which runs under a line ſtone bridge, and throws itſelf into the Danube below the city ; and the rivers Luber and Nab mix with it above the city. The French call it Ratiſbon, in imitation of the Latins ; it hath formerly been ſubject to the kings of Bavai ia, who made it the place of their reſidence ; but it was declared free by the emperor Frederick 1. which does not however hinder the dukes of Bavaria from •dividing the toll with the citizens, according to an agreement between them. Th¢fe princes have alfo the criminal juriidiction, for which the magiſtrates of the city pay them homage, lt is the firſt city of the bench of Suabia, and contains at prefent within its walls five different free ſtates of the empire ; namely, the biſhop, the abbot of St Emmeran, the abbeſſes of the Low and High Munſter, and the city. The inhabitants of Ratifoon have the privilege not to be cited before other tribunals, unleſs for actions above 400 florins. The ſenate is compoſed of 17 members, and there is a council of 10, which is charged with the government of the ſtate. The citizens have a right to elect a chief, who judges of the affairs of police. The catholics have the exercife of their religion in the cathedral church, and others, and</p>

<p>the Lutherans in three churches, which they have built. The magiſtrates and officers of the city are all Proteſtants ; and it is to be remarked, that although there are about 2 2 Catholic churches, yet there are very few Catholic citizens, the magiſtracy not allowing the freedom of the town to be given to Catholics living there. As this city is large,.elegant, and full of magnificent houſes,-it has been choſen many years for the place of holding the diet, upon account of the conveniency, to many neighbouring princes and ſtates, of ι <hi rend="sup">f</hi> ending their provi-ſions by land and water,■ without great expence. The town-houſe, in the hall of which the Diet meets, is extremely magnificent. In the year 1740, however, when there was a war in Germany, the Diet met at Frankfort on the Main, till after the death of the emperor Charles VII. Proviſions are very plentiful at Ratiſhon in time of peace. The inhabitants have a good deal of trade, the river on which it ſtands being navigable, and communicating with a great part of Germany. lt is 55 miles ſouth-eaſt of Nuremberg, 62 north of Munich, and 1 95 weſt of vienna.
