<p><span class="font0">the crane fixes that of the ash pit and coke store. The ’passengers alighting get down from the west side of the&nbsp;carriages, and go out from the west side of the railway. The&nbsp;passengers who are getting up, do so on the east side of the&nbsp;carriages, and come to the carriages from the east side of&nbsp;the railway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The horses and carriages which are to leave the train, must, of course, be at the end of it. These, when detached,&nbsp;are to be run back, or to the northward, where a tumplate&nbsp;should be fixed to take them up by the cross line, to the&nbsp;spot where they are to be landed. This spot, which should&nbsp;be a third line of rails farther east, should be so far to the&nbsp;northward of the station house, that a siding can be run&nbsp;from the third or extra line of rails into the main east line, so&nbsp;as to beclearof the end of the train; andon this Sidingshould&nbsp;be the embarked carriages which are to join the train. On&nbsp;the west side of the railway, there should be another addi-' tional line of rails, with a cross line from it to the place&nbsp;where thecarriages areembarked. Alongthis line the goods&nbsp;may be brought. It will be readily seen that all the required objects will be effected by this arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the western line, the water crane should be sufficiently to the north of the station, to allow the centre of an average train to be opposite the station-house, when the tender is under the crane. The ash-pit and coke-store are, as in&nbsp;the previous case, regulated by the position of the crane.&nbsp;The passengers w'ho are leaving the train, get out on the&nbsp;eastern side of the carriages, and leave the railway also on&nbsp;the eastern side. The passengers who are to join the train&nbsp;are waiting on the western side, and get into the carriages&nbsp;on that side. The horses and carriages which are to leave&nbsp;the train, are run back to the southward, past the siding&nbsp;from the west additional line by which those come on which&nbsp;are joining it, and are brought back to that siding, when&nbsp;clear of the carriages joining the train. By the siding they&nbsp;get on to the west additional line, and going to the northward, are taken across as soon as the train has left, and are&nbsp;disembarked at the proper spot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Goods joining or leaving the train arc managed exactly in the same way. Those which are to leave it being run back&nbsp;on the main line, till past the Sidingbywhich those comeinto&nbsp;the main line which are to join the train ; and when these&nbsp;are clear, those which left the train a.re to be brought to&nbsp;the siding, and run into the goods’ station. Proper waiting&nbsp;rooms for the passengers should, of course, be provided on&nbsp;each side of the railway, and their exit and entrance will be&nbsp;by stairs, either up or down, as the station is situated on&nbsp;an embarkment or in a cutting. A foot-bridge may sometimes be thrown across with advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is such a decided convenience in having all stations on a level, that we should strongly recommend them to be placed so wherever it is at all practicable, even if&nbsp;there is some little sacrificed in another point of view ; but&nbsp;this is a matter which will, in general, be so completely&nbsp;governed by the localities, that it may not be possible, in&nbsp;many cases, to attain it. When this happens, however, great&nbsp;care must be taken to make the approaches wide, and of a&nbsp;gentle slope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As the works proceed towards completion, so many causes will arise to engage the engineers and directors, even without&nbsp;the occurrence of any particularly great accidents, that on&nbsp;all the leading questions time should be taken by the forelock. Springs of water, rock, and quicksands, will be met&nbsp;with where least expected perhaps, and the constant exertion of every talent will be required towards the close of&nbsp;the works. Good drainage will be most wanted when least&nbsp;at command ; and work done with wet materials will be&nbsp;always slipping. Many times have embankments made of&nbsp;wet clayey earth slipped at all kinds of slopes ; and although&nbsp;hundreds of cubic yards of dry material have been tipped&nbsp;on to them, they have been swallowed up and totally dis</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">appeared, whilst, at last, the only remedy to be found was weighting the slip itself with a sufficient quantity of earth&nbsp;to enable it to bear the embankment above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When rock occurs at any height up the sides of an excavation, advantage may sometimes be taken of it to decrease the expense, by cutting only a sufficient width for the railway, and having no slope to the earth below the rock,&nbsp;but building up retaining walls from the railway below when&nbsp;bottomed out to the rock above, or w<sup>τ</sup>hat is called undersetting, an example of which may be seen at the great Blis-worth cutting on the London and Birmingham railway. (See&nbsp;Plate CCCCXXVL figs. 2, 3, 4.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will often happen that many parts of the permanent way are laid prior to its being possible to open either end of&nbsp;the line for traffic. These had better be kept in repair by the&nbsp;contractor ; but when the line is once opened, or any part of&nbsp;it, for the purpose of travelling, it will be much the best way&nbsp;for the company themselves to keep it in order, taking especial care that the contractor repays them a proper price for so&nbsp;doing. The consequences of any accident by the engine or&nbsp;carriages getting thrown off the rails are so frightful, that&nbsp;no attention and expense can be thought too great which&nbsp;can prevent such an occurrence. We have seen instances&nbsp;in which carriages have undergone so complete a smash, that&nbsp;not a square foot of plank could be picked up anywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A set of plate-layers consists of nine men for tumplates ; twelve for laying rails ; five for repairing the way ; and six&nbsp;for laying in points and crossings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To each set, the following tools will be required :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2 chissel-ended crowbars for drawing spikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1 point-ended crowbar for moving rails, the point being put in the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1 claw-ended crowbar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1 cuddy or three-legged stand for the levers, so called from the name of the inventor. (Fig. 19·)</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
