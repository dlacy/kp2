<p><label>REYER, ERNEST</label>
(1823- ), French composer, was born</p><p>at Marseilles on the ist of December 1823. At the age of sixteen he went to Algeria, and remained there some years. The outcome of his residence there was a symphonic ode entitled <hi rend="italic">Le Sêlam,</hi> the musical orientalism of which had, unluckily for him, already been anticipated by Félicien David in <hi rend="italic">Le Désert. Maître Wolfram,</hi> a one-act opera, was produced at the Opéra comique</p>
<pb xml:id="eb11-23-r02-0226" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0249.jp2"/><p>in 1854; and in 1858 <hi rend="italic">Sacunlala,</hi> a ballet, at the Opéra. It was the production of <hi rend="italic">La Stalue</hi> at the Théâtre lyrique in 1861 that brought Reyer’s name prominently before the public. But’ Reyer had to wait several years before obtaining a real and permanent success. <hi rend="italic">Erostrate,</hi> an opera produced at Baden-Baden in 1862, and given at the Paris Opéra some ten years later, was a failure. The composer had in the meanwhile set to work on <hi rend="italic">Sigurd,</hi> the subject of which is the same that inspired Wagner in <hi rend="italic">Siegfried</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Götterdämmerung.</hi> It was at last produced in Brussels in 1884, and subsequently brought out at the Paris Opéra. <hi rend="italic">Sigurd</hi> is a work of great value, displaying its composer’s .elevated notions as regards the form of the “ lyrical drama.” <hi rend="italic">Salamrnbb,</hi> founded upon Flaubert’s romance, was successfully produced at Brussels in 1890. Gluck, Weber, Berlioz and Wagner exercised' most influence over Reyer. As a musical critic (preceding Berlioz in that capacity for the <hi rend="italic">Journal des débats)</hi> Reyer was a well-known writer; and he became librarian of the Paris Opéra, and a member of the Institute. His <hi rend="italic">Quarante Ans de musique</hi> (with biographical notice by E. Henriot) was published in 1909.</p>
