<p><span class="font0">a superficial account of the traffic in indulgences, and a rough and ready assumption, which even Köstlin makes,&nbsp;that the darkness was greatest just before the dawn.&nbsp;Unfortunately this crude solution of the problem proved&nbsp;too much; for conditions were no worse immediately&nbsp;before the revolt than they had been for centuries, and&nbsp;German complaints of papal tyranny go back to Hildegard&nbsp;of Bingen and Walther von der Vogelweide, who antedated&nbsp;Luther by more than three centuries. So a new theory is&nbsp;logically demanded to explain why these conditions, which were&nbsp;chronic, failed to produce a change long before it actually&nbsp;occurred. Singularly enough it is the modern Catholic scholars,&nbsp;Johannes Janssen above all, who, in their efforts further to&nbsp;discredit the Protestant revolt by rehabilitating the institutions&nbsp;which the reformers attacked, have done most to explain the&nbsp;success of the Reformation. A humble, patient Bohemian&nbsp;priest, Hasak, set to work toward half a century ago to bring&nbsp;together the devotional works published during the seventy&nbsp;years immediately succeeding the invention of printing. Every&nbsp;one knows that one at least of these older books, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The German&nbsp;Theology,</span><span class="font0"> was a great favourite of Luther’s; but there are&nbsp;many more in Hasak’s collection which breathe the same spirit&nbsp;of piety and spiritual emulation. Building upon the founda-tions laid by Hasak and other Catholic writers who have been&nbsp;too much neglected by Protestant historians, Janssen pro-duced a monumental work in defence of the German Church&nbsp;before Luther’s defection. He exhibits the great achievements&nbsp;of the latter part of the 15th and the early portion of the 16th&nbsp;centuries; the art and literature, the material prosperity of&nbsp;the towns and the fostering of the spiritual life of the people.&nbsp;It may well be that his picture is too bright, and that in his&nbsp;obvious anxiety to prove the needlessness of an ecclesiastical&nbsp;revolution he has gone to the opposite extreme from the Protestants. Yet this rehabilitation of pre-Reformation Germany&nbsp;cannot but make a strong appeal to the unbiased historical&nbsp;student who looks to a conscientious study of the antecedents&nbsp;of the revolt as furnishing the true key to the movement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Outwardly the Reformation would seem to have begun when, on the 10th of December 1520, a professor in the university&nbsp;of Wittenberg invited all the friends of evangelical&nbsp;truth among his students to assemble outside the&nbsp;wall at the ninth hour to witness a pious spectacle—&nbsp;the burning of the “ godless book of the papal&nbsp;decrees.” He committed to the flames the whole&nbsp;body of the canon law, together with an edict of&nbsp;the head of the Church which had recently been&nbsp;issued against his teachings. In this manner Martin</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Luther, with the hearty sympathy of a considerable number of his countrymen, publicly proclaimed and illustrated his&nbsp;repudiation of the papal government under which western&nbsp;Europe had lived for centuries. Within a generation after this event the states of north Germany and&nbsp;Scandinavia, England, Scotland, the Dutch Netherlands and&nbsp;portions of Switzerland, had each in its particular manner&nbsp;permanently seceded from the papal monarchy. France, after&nbsp;a long period of uncertainty and disorder, remained faithful to&nbsp;the bishop of Rome. Poland, after a defection of years, was&nbsp;ultimately recovered for the papacy by the zeal and devotion of the Jesuit missionaries. In the Habsburg hereditary&nbsp;dominions the traditional policy and Catholic fervour of the&nbsp;ruling house resulted, after a long struggle, in the restoration of&nbsp;the supremacy of Rome; while in Hungary the national spirit&nbsp;of independence kept Calvinism alive to divide the religious&nbsp;allegiance of the people. In Italy and Spain, on the other&nbsp;hand, the rulers, who continued loyal to the pope, found&nbsp;little difficulty in suppressing any tendencies of revolt on the&nbsp;part of the few converts to the new doctrines. Individuals,&nbsp;often large groups, and even whole districts, had indeed earlier&nbsp;rejected some portions of the Roman Catholic faith, or refused&nbsp;obedience to the ecclesiastical government; but previously to&nbsp;the burning of the canon law by Luther no prince had openly and permanently cast off his allegiance to the international&nbsp;ecclesiastical state of which the bishop of Rome was head. Now,&nbsp;a prince or legislative assembly that accepted the doctrine of&nbsp;Luther, that the temporal power had been “ ordained by God&nbsp;for the chastisement of the wicked and the protection of the&nbsp;good ” and must be permitted to exercise its functions “ un-hampered throughout the whole Christian body, without respect&nbsp;to persons, whether it strikes popes, bishops, priests, monks,&nbsp;nuns, or whoever else ”—such a government could proceed to&nbsp;ratify such modifications of the Christian faith as appealed to&nbsp;it in a particular religious confession; it could order its subject&nbsp;to conform to the innovations, and could expel, persecute or&nbsp;tolerate dissenters, as seemed good to it. A “ reformed ”&nbsp;prince could seize the property of the monasteries, and appropriate such ecclesiastical foundations as he desired. He could&nbsp;make rules for the selection of the clergy, disregarding the&nbsp;ancient canons of the Church and the claims of the pope to the&nbsp;right of ratification. He could cut off entirely all forms of&nbsp;papal taxation and put an end to papal jurisdiction. The&nbsp;personnel, revenue, jurisdiction, ritual, even the faith of the&nbsp;Church, were in this way placed under the complete control&nbsp;of the territorial governments. This is the central and significant fact of the so-called Reformation. Wholly novel and&nbsp;distinctive it is not, for the rulers of Catholic countries, like&nbsp;Spain and France, and of England (before the publication of the&nbsp;Act of Supremacy) could and did limit the pope’s claims to&nbsp;unlimited jurisdiction, patronage and taxation, and they&nbsp;introduced the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">placet</span><span class="font0"> forbidding the publication within their&nbsp;realms of papal edicts, decisions and orders, without the express&nbsp;sanction of the government—in short, in many ways tended&nbsp;to approach the conditions in Protestant lands. The Reformation was thus essentially a stage in the disengaging of the&nbsp;modern state from that medieval, international ecclesiastical&nbsp;state which had its beginning in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ecclesia</span><span class="font0"> of the Acts of the&nbsp;Apostles. An appreciation of the issues of the Reformation—&nbsp;or Protestant revolt, as it might be more exactly called—depends&nbsp;therefore upon an understanding of the development of the papal&nbsp;monarchy, the nature of its claims, the relations it established&nbsp;with the civil powers, the abuses which developed in it and the&nbsp;attempts to rectify them, the sources of friction between the&nbsp;Church and the government, and finally the process by which&nbsp;certain of the European states threw off their allegiance to&nbsp;the Christian commonwealth, of which they had so long formed&nbsp;a part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is surprising to observe how early the Christian Church assumed the form of a state, and how speedily upon entering&nbsp;into its momentous alliance with the Roman imperial&nbsp;government under Constantine it acquired the chief&nbsp;privileges and prerogatives it was so long to retain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the twelfth book of the Theodosian Code we see the foundations of the medieval Church already laid; for it was the 4th, not the 13th century that established the&nbsp;principle that defection from the Church was a crime in the&nbsp;eyes of the State, and raised the clergy to a privileged class,&nbsp;exempted from the ordinary taxes, permitted under restrictions&nbsp;to try its own members and to administer the wealth which&nbsp;flowed into its coffers from the gifts of the faithful. The&nbsp;bishop of Rome, who had from the first probably enjoyed a&nbsp;leading position in the Church as “ the successor of the two&nbsp;most glorious of the apostles,” elaborated his claims to be the&nbsp;divinely appointed head of the ecclesiastical organization.&nbsp;Siricius (384-389), Leo the Great (440-461), and Gelasius I.&nbsp;(492-496) left little for their successors to add to the arguments&nbsp;in favour of the papal supremacy. In short, if we recall the&nbsp;characteristics of the Church in the West from the times of Constantine to those of Theodoric—its reliance upon the civil power&nbsp;for favours and protection, combined with its assumption of a&nbsp;natural superiority over the civil power and its innate tendency&nbsp;to monarchical unity—it becomes clear that Gregory VII.&nbsp;in his effort in the latter half of the 11th century to establish&nbsp;the papacy as the great central power of western Europe was&nbsp;in the main only reaffirming and developing old claims in a&nbsp;new world. His brief statement of the papal powers as he</span></p>
