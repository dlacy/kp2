<p><span class="font0">was to Queen Anne, is her subject, and may be guilty of ' high treason against her; but in the instance of conjugal&nbsp;fidelity he is not subjected to the same penal restrictions.&nbsp;Hence, if a queen consort is unfaithful to the royal bed,&nbsp;this may debase or bastardize the heirs to the crown ; but&nbsp;no such danger can be consequent on the infidelity of the&nbsp;husband to a queen regnant. A queen dowager is the&nbsp;widow of the king, and as such enjoys most of the privileges belonging to her as queen consort. But it is not high&nbsp;treason to conspire her death, or to violate her chastity;&nbsp;because the succession to the crown is not thereby endangered. Yet still, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pro dignitate regali,</span><span class="font0"> no man can marry&nbsp;a queen dowager without special license from the king, on&nbsp;pain of forfeiting his lands and goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Prince of Wales, or heir apparent to the crown,&nbsp;and also his royal consort, and the princess royal or eldest&nbsp;daughter of the king, are likewise peculiarly regarded by&nbsp;the laws. For, by statute 25 Edw. III. to compass or conspire the death of the former, or to violate the chastity of&nbsp;either of the latter, is as much high treason as to conspire the death of the king or violate the chastity of the&nbsp;queen ; and this upon the same reason as was before given,&nbsp;because the prince of Wales is next in succession to the&nbsp;crown, and to violate his wife might taint the blood-royal&nbsp;with bastardy. And the eldest daughter of the king is also&nbsp;alone inheritable to the crown on failure of issue male, and&nbsp;therefore more respected by the laws than any of her&nbsp;younger sisters; insomuch that upon this, united with other&nbsp;principles, whilst our military tenures were in force, the&nbsp;king might levy an aid for marrying his eldest daughter,&nbsp;and her only. The heir apparent to the crown is usually&nbsp;made Prince of Wales and Earl of Chester, by special creation and investiture; but being the king’s eldest son, he is&nbsp;by inheritance Duke of Cornwall, without any new creation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest of the royal family may be considered in two&nbsp;different lights, according to the different senses in which&nbsp;the term </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">royal family</span><span class="font0"> is used. The larger sense includes&nbsp;all those who are by any possibility inheritable to the crown.&nbsp;Such, before the Revolution, were all the descendants of&nbsp;William the Conqueror, who had branched into an amazing extent by intermarriages with the ancient nobility.&nbsp;Since the Revolution and Act of Settlement, it means the&nbsp;Protestant issue of the Princess Sophia, now comparatively&nbsp;few in number, but which in process of time may possibly&nbsp;be as largely diffused. The more confined sense includes&nbsp;only those who are in a certain degree of propinquity to the&nbsp;reigning prince, and to whom therefore the law pays an&nbsp;extraordinary regard and respect; but after that degree is&nbsp;past, they fall into the rank of ordinary subjects, and are&nbsp;seldom considered any further unless called to the succession upon failure of the nearer lines. For though collateral consanguinity is regarded indefinitely with respect to&nbsp;inheritance or succession, yet it is and can only be regarded&nbsp;within some certain limits in any other respect, by the natural constitution of things and the dictates of' positive law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By statute 12 Geo. III. c. 11, no descendant of the body of Geo. II. other than the issue of princesses married&nbsp;into foreign families, is capable of contracting matrimony,&nbsp;without the previous consent of the king signified under the&nbsp;great seal; and any marriage contracted without such a consent is void. It is provided, however, that such of the said descendants as are not above twenty-five, may, after a twelvemonth’s notice given to the king’s privy council, contract&nbsp;and solemnize marriage without the consent of the crown,&nbsp;unless both houses of parliament shall, before the expiration of the said year, expressly declare their disapprobation of such intended marriage ; and all persons solemnizing, assisting, or being present at any such prohibited marriage, shall incur the penalties of the statute of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">præmunire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Royal Oak, a fair spreading tree at Boscobel, in the parish of Donnington, in Staffordshire, the boughs of which</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">were once covered with ivy, in the thick of which King Charles II. sat in the day-time with Colonel Careless, and in the night lodged in Boscobel House. They are mistaken&nbsp;who speak of it as an old hollow oak, it being then a gay&nbsp;flourishing tree, surrounded with many more. Its poor&nbsp;remains were fenced in with a handsome wall, with this inscription in gold letters: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Felicissimam arborem quam in&nbsp;asylum potentissimi regis Carols II. Deus op. max. per&nbsp;quem reges regnant, hic crescere voluit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROYMUNGUL, a river of Bengal, which falls into the Sunderbunds, and is strongly affected by the tides. The&nbsp;East India Company have an extensive salt manufactory on&nbsp;its banks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROYSTON, a market-town on the northern border of the county of Hertford, and partly within the county of Cambridge, thirty-eight miles from London. There was here an&nbsp;ancient priory, said to have been founded in the reign of&nbsp;Henry II. by a lady of the name of Roysia, from whom the&nbsp;town takes its name. The chapel of the priory now serves&nbsp;as the parish church. There is a large market held on&nbsp;Thursday, at which much corn is sold. There are some&nbsp;considerable brewers. The population amounted in 1811&nbsp;to 1331, in 1821 to 1474, and in 1831 to 1757.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RSHOVV Waldimirow', a city of Russia, in the province of Twer, and the capital of a circle of the same name. It is situated on the river Volga, where it receives the waters of the Ryolenka. It contains twelve churches, 1252&nbsp;houses, and 7500 inhabitants. It has considerable trade&nbsp;by the river in the productions of the land, and some manufactures. Long. 34. 29. E. Lat. 56. 10. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUABON, a large village or town of the county of Denbigh, in North Wales, 192 miles from London, and four&nbsp;from Wrexham. It is pleasantly situated on an elevation,&nbsp;and has a neat church, with some elegant monuments to&nbsp;the family of Sir Watkins William Wynn, whose magnificent seat of Wynnstay is near to it. The agricultural&nbsp;society established at this place has much contributed to&nbsp;the improvement of the soil and of cultivation. The population amounted in 1801 to 5598, in 1811 to 6122, in 1821&nbsp;to 8556, and in 1831 to 8353 ; but it includes the whole&nbsp;parish, which comprehended five townships.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUANELLI, a valley in the island of Ceylon, famed for its precious stones. The river on which Columbo, the&nbsp;capital, is situated, is navigable to this place by boats. The&nbsp;precious stones and other metallic substances are found in&nbsp;the environs of Ruanelli, amongst the sand and gravel of the&nbsp;river. They consist chiefly of sapphires, topazes, garnets,&nbsp;amethysts, moonstone, tourmalines, and cats-eyes. The&nbsp;land is let on short leases to the highest bidder ; and although they are exempted from duties, it produces, after all,&nbsp;but a trifling revenue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUBBER, India. See Caoutchouc.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUBENS, Sir Peter Paul, the most eminent of the Flemish painters, was born in the year 1577, but whether at&nbsp;Antwerp or Cologne is uncertain. His father, who was a&nbsp;counsellor in the senate of Antwerp, had been forced by&nbsp;the civil wars to seek refuge in Cologne; and during his&nbsp;residence there Rubens is commonly said to have been&nbsp;born.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genius of Rubens, which began to unfold itself in his earliest years, was cultivated with peculiar care, and&nbsp;embellished with every branch of classical and polite literature. He soon discovered a strong inclination for designing, and used to amuse himself with that employment&nbsp;in his leisure hours, whilst the rest of his time was devoted&nbsp;to other studies. His mother, perceiving the bias of her&nbsp;son, permitted him to attend the instructions of Tobias&nbsp;Verhaecht, a painter of architecture and of landscape. He&nbsp;next became the pupil of Adam Van Oort; but he soon&nbsp;found that the abilities of this master were insufficient to&nbsp;answer his elevated ideas. His surly temper, too, was dis-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
