The meeting of it was to ſerve as a ſignal for taking up arms ; and accordingly its deliberations were fcarcely begun in 1546, when the Proteſtants perceived undoubted ſigns of the approaching ftorm, and a formidable union betwixt the emperor and pope, which threatened to cruſh and overwhelm them at once. This year indeed there had been a new conference at Ratiſbon upon the old fubject of accom-modating differences in religion ; but from the manner in which the debates were carried on, it plainly ap-peared that theſe differences could only be decided in the field of battle. The council of Trent, in the mean time, promulgated their decrees ; while the reformed princes, in the diet of Ratiſhon, proteſted againſt their authority, and were on that account profcribed By the emperor, who raiſed an army to reduce them to obedience. See <hi rend="italic">Father Paul’s Hiftory oſ the Council oſ Trent,</hi>  and our articles Paul (Father), and Trent.</p><p>The elector of Saxony and the landgrave of Hefle led their forces into Bavaria againſt the emperor, and cannonaded his camp at Ingoldſtalt. It was ſuppoſed that this would bring on an engagement, which would probably have been advantageous to the cauſe of the reformed ; but this was prevented, chiefly by the per-ſidy of Maurice duke of Saxony, who invaded the dominions of his uncle. Diviſions were alſo fomented among the confederate princes, by the diffimulation of the emperor ; and France failed in paying the ſubſidy which had been promiſed by its monarch : all which ſo diſcouraged the heads of the Proteſtant party, that their army ſoon diſperſed, and the elector of Saxony was obliged to direct his march homewards. But he was purſued by the emperor, who made ſeveral forced marches, with a view to deſtroy his enemy before he ſhould have time to recover his vigour. The two armies met near Muhlberg, on the Elbe, on the 24th of April 1547 ; and, after a bloody action, the elector was entirely defeated, and himſelf taken priſoner.— Maurice, who had ſo baſely betrayed him, was now declared elector of Saxony ; and by his intreaties Philip landgrave of Heſſe, the other chief of the Prote-ſtants, was perſuaded to throw himfelf on the mercy of the emperor, and to implore his pardon. To this he conſented, relying on the promiſe of Charles for obtaining forgiveneſs, and being reſtored to liberty ; but, not-withſtanding theſe expectations, he was unjuſtly detained priſoner, by a fcandalous violation of the moſt ſolemn convention. It is faid that the emperor retracted his promiſe, and deluded this unhappy prince by the ambiguity of two German words. Hiſtory in-deed can ſcarce afford a parallel to the perfidious, mean-ſpirited, and deſpotic behaviour of the emperor in the preſent caſe. After having received in pub-lic the humble ſubmiſſion of the prince on his knees, and after having ſet him at liberty by a ſolemn treaty, he had him arreſted anew without any reafon, nay, without any pretence, and kept him cloſe priſoner for ſeveral years, when Maurice remonſtrated againſt this new confinement, the emperor anfwered<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  .</p><p>that he had never promiſed that the landgrave fhould not be impriſoned anew, but only that he ſhould be exempted from perpetual imprifonment ; and, to ſupport this aſſertion, he produced the treaty, in which his miniſters had perſidioufly foiſted <hi rend="italic">ewiger gefangnis, </hi>which ſigniſies a " perpetual prifon,” inſtead of <hi rend="italic">einiger gsfuιgnis,</hi>  which ſigniſies " any prifon.” This, however, is conteſted by ſome hiſtorians.</p><p>The affairs of the Proteſtants now ſeemed to be de-ſperate. In the diet of Augſhurg, which was ſoon after called, the emperor required the Proteſtants to leave the deciſion of theſe religious diſputes to the wiſdom of the council which was to meet at Trent. The greateſt part of the members conſented to this propoſal, being convinced by the powerful argument of an imperial army, which was at hand to diſpel the darkneſs from the eyes of ſuch as might otherwiſe have been blind to the force of Charles’s reaſoning. However, this general ſubmiffion did not produce the effect which was expected from it. A plague which broke out, or was ſaid to do ſo, in the city, cauſed the greateſt part of the biſhops to retire to Bologna ; by which means the council was in effect diſſolved, nor could all the intreaties and remonſtrances of the emperor prevail upon the pope to re-aſſemble it without delay. During this interval, therefore, the emperor judged it neceſſary to fall upon ſome method of ac-commodating the religious differences, and maintaining peace until the council ſo long expected ſhould be finally obtained, with this view he ordered Julius Pelugius bilhop of Naumberg, Michael Sidonius, a creature of the pope, and John Agricola, a native of Ayſelben, to draw up a formulary which might ſerve as a rule of faith and worſhip, till the council ſhould be affembled : but as this was only a temporary expedient, and had not the force of a permanent or perpetual inſtitution, it thence obtained the name of the <hi rend="italic">Interim.</hi></p><p>This project of Charles was formed partly with a deſign to vent his reſentment againſt the pope, and partly to anſwer other political purpoſes. It contain-ed all the eſſential doctrines of the church of Rome, though conſiderably foftened by the artful terms which were employed, and which were quite different from thoſe employed before and after this period by the council of Trent. There was even an affected ambiguity in many oſ the expreffiυns, which made them ſufceptible of different ſenſes, and applicable to the ſentiments of both communions. The conſequence of all this was, that the imperial creed was reprobated by both parties. However, it was promulgated with great ſolemnity by the emperor at Augſhurg. The elector of Mentz, without even afl&lt;ing the opinion of the princes preſent, gave a ſanction <hi rend="italic">Λ,ο</hi>  this formula, as if he had been commiffioned to repreſent the whole diet- Many kept ſilence through fear, and that ſilence was interpreted as a tacit conſent. Some had the courage to oppoſe it, and theſe were reduced by force of arms ; and the moſt deplorable ſcenes of bloodſhed and violence were acted throughout the whole empire. Maurice, elector of Saxony, who had hitherto kept neutral, now affembled the whole of his nobility and clergy, in order to deliberate on this critical affair. At the head of the latter was Melancthon, whoſe word was reſpected as a law among the Proteſtants.
