<p><span class="font1">Cumaean colony of Palaepolis@@<sup>1</sup> had incurred the wrath of Rome by its raids into her territory in Campania. The Samnitcs&nbsp;sent a force to defend it, and Rome replied by a declaration&nbsp;of war. The two opponents were not at first sight unequally&nbsp;matched, and had the Sabcllian tribes held firmly together the&nbsp;issue of the struggle might have been different. As it was,&nbsp;however, the Lucanians to the south actually joined Rome&nbsp;from the first, while the northern clans, Marsi, Vestini, Paeligni,&nbsp;Frcntani, after a feeble and lukewarm resistance, subsided into&nbsp;a neutrality which was exchanged in 304 for a formal&nbsp;alliance with Rome. An even greater advantage to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rome from the outset was the enmity existing between the Samnites and the Apulians, the latter of whom from the first&nbsp;joined Rome and thus gave her a position in the rear of&nbsp;her enemy and in a country eminently well fitted for&nbsp;maintaining a large military force. These weaknesses on the&nbsp;Samnite side were amply illustrated by the events of the&nbsp;war.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first seven or eight years were marked by one serious disaster to the Roman arms, the defeat at the Caudine Forks&nbsp;(321), but, when in 318 the Samnites asked for&nbsp;and obtained a two years’ truce, Rome had succeeded not only in inflicting several severe blows upon&nbsp;her enemies but in isolating them from outside help. The&nbsp;Lucanians to the south were her allies. To the east, in the rear&nbsp;of Samnium, Apulia acknowledged the suzerainty of Rome, and&nbsp;Luceria, captured in 320, had been established as a base&nbsp;of Roman operations. Finally to the north the Romans&nbsp;had easily overcome the feeble resistance of the Vestini and&nbsp;Frentani, and secured through their territories a safe passage&nbsp;for their legions to Apulia. On the renewal of hostilities in&nbsp;316, the Samnites, bent on escaping from the net which&nbsp;was being slowly drawn round them, made a series of&nbsp;desperate efforts to break through the lines of defence which&nbsp;protected Latium and Campania. Sora and Fregellae on the&nbsp;upper Liris were captured by a sudden attack; the Ausones&nbsp;in the low country near the mouth of the same river were&nbsp;encouraged to revolt by the appearance of the Samnite army;&nbsp;and in Campania another army, attracted by rumours of disturbance, all but defeated the Roman consuls under the very&nbsp;walls of Capua. But these efforts were unavailing. Sora and&nbsp;Fregellae were recovered as quickly as they had been lost, and&nbsp;the frontier there was strengthened by the establishment of&nbsp;a colony at Interamna. The Ausones were punished by the&nbsp;confiscation of their territory, and Roman supremacy further&nbsp;secured by the two colonies of Suessa and Pontia (312). The&nbsp;construction of the famous Via Appia,@@<sup>2</sup> the work of the censor&nbsp;Appius Claudius Caecus, opened a safe and direct route to&nbsp;Campania, while the capture of Nola deprived the Samnites of&nbsp;their last important stronghold in the Campanian lowlands.&nbsp;The failure of these attempts broke the courage even of the Samnites. Their hopes were indeed raised for a moment by the news&nbsp;that Etruria had risen against Rome (310), but their daring&nbsp;scheme of effecting a union with the Etruscans was frustrated&nbsp;by the energy of the Roman generals. Five years&nbsp;later (305) the Romans revenged a Samnite raid into</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Campania by an invasion of &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samnium&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Arpinum on</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">.the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;frontier was taken, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at last,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;twenty-two</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">years’ struggle, the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samnite War was</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">closed by a renewal &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ancient&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treaty with</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rome (304).@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The six years of peace which followed (304-298) were employed by Rome in still further strengthening her position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Already, two years before the peace, a rash revolt of the Hernici@@<sup>4</sup> had given Rome a pretext for finally&nbsp;annexing the territory of her ancient allies. The tribal confederacy was broken up, and all the Hernican communities,&nbsp;with the exception of three which had not joined the revolt,&nbsp;were incorporated with the Roman state as municipia, with the&nbsp;civil rights of the Roman franchise. Between the Hernican</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">valley and the frontiers of the nearest Sabellian tribes lay what remained of the once formidable people of the Aequi. In&nbsp;their case, too, a revolt (304) was followed by the&nbsp;annexation of their territory, which was marked in this&nbsp;case by the formation there (301) of two Roman tribes&nbsp;(Aniensis and Teretina).@@<sup>5</sup> Not content with thus carrying the&nbsp;borders of their own territory up to the very frontiers of the&nbsp;Sabellian country, Rome succeeded (304) in finally detaching&nbsp;from the Sabellian confederacy all the tribes lying@@<sup>6</sup> between&nbsp;the north-east frontier of Latium and the Adriatic Sea.&nbsp;Henceforward the Marsi, Paeligni, Vestini, Marrucini and&nbsp;Frentani were enrolled among the allies of Rome, and not&nbsp;only swelled her forces in the field but interposed a useful&nbsp;barrier between her enemies to the north in Etruria and Umbria&nbsp;and those to the south in Samnium, while they connected her&nbsp;directly with the friendly Apulians. Lastly, as a security for&nbsp;the fidelity at least of the nearest of these allies, colonies&nbsp;were planted in the Marsian territories at Alba Fueentia&nbsp;(303) and at Carsioli (298). A significant indication&nbsp;of the widening range of Rome’s influence in Italy,&nbsp;and of the new responsibilities rapidly pressing upon her,&nbsp;is the fact that when in 302 the Spartan Clconymus&nbsp;landed in the territory of the Sallentini, far away&nbsp;in the south-east, he was met and repulsed by a Roman&nbsp;force.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Six years after the conclusion of the treaty which ended the Second Samnite War, news arrived that the Samnites were&nbsp;harassing the Lucanians. Rome at once interfered to&nbsp;protect her allies. Samnium was invaded in force,&nbsp;the country ravaged and one stronghold after another&nbsp;captured. Unable any longer to hold their own in a&nbsp;position where they were hedged round by enemies,&nbsp;the Samnite leaders turned as a last hope to the communities of northern Etruria, to the free tribes of Umbria&nbsp;and to the once dreaded Celts. With a splendid daring they&nbsp;formed the scheme of uniting all these peoples with themselves in a last desperate effort to break the power of&nbsp;Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For some forty years after the final annexation of southern Etruria (351 b.c.) matters had remained unchanged&nbsp;in that quarter. Sutrium and Nepcte still guarded&nbsp;the Roman frontier; the natural boundary of the&nbsp;Ciminian forest was still intact; and up the valley of&nbsp;the Tiber Rome had not advanced beyond Falerii, a&nbsp;few miles short of the most southerly Umbrian town Oericulum.&nbsp;But in 311, on the expiry, apparently of the long&nbsp;truce with Rome, concluded in 351, the northern&nbsp;Etruscans, alarmed no doubt by the rapid advances which Rome&nbsp;was making farther south, rose in arms and attacked Sutrium.&nbsp;The attack, however, recoiled disastrously upon the heads&nbsp;of the assailants. A Roman force promptly relieved Sutrium,&nbsp;and its leader, Q. Fabius Rullianus, without awaiting orders&nbsp;from home, boldly plunged into the wilds of the Ciminian forest,&nbsp;and crossing them safely swept with fire and sword over the&nbsp;rich lands to the north. Then turning southward he met and&nbsp;utterly defeated the forces which the Etruscans had hastily raised&nbsp;in the hopes of intercepting him at the Vadimonian Lake.@@<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>This decisive victory ended the war. The Etruscan cities, disunited among themselves, and enervated by long years of peace,&nbsp;abandoned the struggle for the time, paid </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">heavy indemnity&nbsp;and concluded a truce with Rome (309-8). In the&nbsp;same year the promptitude of Fabius easily averted&nbsp;a threatened attack by the Umbrians, but Rome proceeded&nbsp;nevertheless to fortify herself in her invariable fashion against&nbsp;future dangers on this side, by an alliance with Oericulum,&nbsp;which was followed ten years later (299) by a colony at Nequinum,<sup>@@9&nbsp;</sup>and an alliance with the Piccntes, whose position in the rear</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
