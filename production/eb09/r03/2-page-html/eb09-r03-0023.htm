<p><span class="font0">the first step in the execution of his project. For some reason or other nothing followed upon this enactment; and in 435 a new&nbsp;and stronger commission was nominated to collect the edicts, but&nbsp;nothing was said in then- instructions about anything ulterior. The&nbsp;work was completed in three years, and published at Constantinople&nbsp;early in the year 438, with the declaration that it should take&nbsp;effect from 1st January following ; and a copy was communicated&nbsp;to Valentinian, who ordained that it should come into force in the&nbsp;West from 12th January 439. The arrangement is in sixteen books,&nbsp;subdivided into titles, in which the constitutions are placed in&nbsp;chronological order. They cover the whole field of law, private&nbsp;and public, civil and criminal, fiscal and municipal, military and&nbsp;ecclesiastical. The private law is contained in the first five, which&nbsp;unfortunately are very defective. The imperial edicts subsequent&nbsp;to the publication of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Code got</span><span class="font0"> the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Novels (novellae&nbsp;constitutiones).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Collatio, the Vatican Fragments, and the Consultatio.— </span><span class="font0">These were unofficial collections. The first—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Collatio Legum Mosaica-rum et Romanarum,</span><span class="font0"> otherwise </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Dei quam Dominus praecepit&nbsp;ad Moysen—</span><span class="font0">is a parallel of divine and human law, the former drawn&nbsp;from the Pentateuch and the latter from the writings of Gaius,&nbsp;Papinian, Paul, Ulpian, and Modestine, rescripts from the Gregorian&nbsp;and Hermogenian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Codes,</span><span class="font0"> and one or two later general enactments.&nbsp;Its date is probably about the year 390, but its authorship is unknown. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vatican Fragments</span><span class="font0"> were discovered by Mai in a palimpsest in the Vatican in 1820,—evidently part of a book of practice&nbsp;compiled in the Westem empire, and of very considerable dimensions.&nbsp;The extant fragments deal with the law of sale, usufruct, dowries,&nbsp;donations, tutories, and processual agency, and are drawn from the&nbsp;writings of Papinian, Ulpian, and Paul, the two collections of rescripts, and a few general enactments, the latest dating from the year&nbsp;372. The compilation, therefore, may be of about the same antiquity&nbsp;as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Collatio.</span><span class="font0"> The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Consultatio (Veteris cujusdam Jurisconsulti&nbsp;Consultatio')</span><span class="font0"> was first published by Cujas in 1577. It seems to be&nbsp;part of a collection of answers upon questions of law submitted for&nbsp;the opinion of counsel, and is of value, for the fragments it contains&nbsp;from Paul’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sentences</span><span class="font0"> and the three </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Codes.</span><span class="font0"> It is thought to have&nbsp;been written in France in the end of the 5th or beginning of the&nbsp;6th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Romano-Barbarian Codes.—</span><span class="font0">This title is usually applied to three collections compiled in western Europe after it had thrown&nbsp;off the sovereignty of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Edictum Theodorici</span><span class="font0"> was compiled at the instance of&nbsp;Theodoric, king of the Ostrogoths, in or very soon after the year&nbsp;500. Its materials were drawn from the writings of the jurists—&nbsp;principally the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sentences</span><span class="font0"> of Paul—the Gregorian, Hermogenian,&nbsp;and Theodosian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Codes,</span><span class="font0"> and the later </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Novels,</span><span class="font0"> all reduced into 154&nbsp;sections, with no systematic arrangement, but touching upon all&nbsp;branches of the law public and private, especially criminal law and&nbsp;procedure. It was professedly intended to apply to all Theodoric’s&nbsp;subjects, both Goths and Romans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Romana Visigothorum</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Breviarium Alaricianum&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">was a much more ambitious and important collection. It was compiled by a commission appointed by Alaric II., king of the Western&nbsp;Goths, with approval of the bishops and nobles, and published at&nbsp;Aire in Gascony in the year 506. The compilers selected their&nbsp;material partly from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">leges</span><span class="font0"> (statute law) and partly from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus</span><span class="font0"> (jurisprudential law), taking what they considered appropriate, without&nbsp;altering the text except in the way of excision of passages that&nbsp;were obsolete or purely historical. For the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">leges</span><span class="font0"> they utilized some&nbsp;400 of the 3400 enactments (according to Haenel’s estimate) of the&nbsp;Theodosian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Code,</span><span class="font0"> and about 30 of the known 104 post-Theodosian&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Novels ; </span><span class="font0">for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus,—</span><span class="font0">the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes</span><span class="font0"> of Gaius, Paul’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sentences,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the Gregorian and Hermogenian rescripts, and the first book of&nbsp;Papinian’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Responses</span><span class="font0"> (a single sentence). All of these, except&nbsp;Gaius, were accompanied with an “interpretation,” which resembles the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">interpretatio</span><span class="font0"> of the XII. Tables in that it is often&nbsp;not so much explanatory of the text as qualificative or corrective.&nbsp;Gaius is contained in an epitome in two books, believed to have&nbsp;been only a reproduction of an abridgment already current, and&nbsp;dating from about the beginning of the 5th century. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Breviary&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">exercised very considerable influence in Europe generally; and&nbsp;there is no question that, until the rise of the Bologna school in&nbsp;the 12th century, it was from it, rather than from the books of&nbsp;Justinian, that western Europe acquired its scanty knowledge of&nbsp;Roman law’.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lex Romana Burgundionum,</span><span class="font0"> formerly, owing to a mistake&nbsp;of a transcriber, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Papianus,</span><span class="font0"> is the collection which King&nbsp;Gundobald, wdien publishing his code of native law </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Lex Burgundionum</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gundobada),</span><span class="font0"> had promised should be prepared for&nbsp;the use of his Roman subjects. It deals with private law, criminal&nbsp;law, and judicial procedure, distributed through 47 titles, and is&nbsp;arranged very much after the order of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gundobada,</span><span class="font0"> from which&nbsp;it has a few extracts. Its statutory Roman sources are the same&nbsp;as those of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Breviary</span><span class="font0">; the jurisprudential authorities referred&nbsp;to are Gaius and Paul, the latter in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sentences,</span><span class="font0"> and the former&nbsp;(only three times altogether) in some other book than his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">III. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Justinianian Legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Justinian’s Collections and his own Legislation.—</span><span class="font1">It is unnecessary to revert to the history of Justinian outside&nbsp;his legislative achievements, or even to speak of his collections in detail, for both have already been described in&nbsp;the article </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Justinian</span><span class="font1"> I. (vol. xiii. p. 792 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sq.).</span><span class="font1"> Ambitious to carry out a reform more complete even than&nbsp;that which Theodosius had planned but failed to execute,&nbsp;he took the first step towards it little more than six months&nbsp;after the death of his uncle Justin, in the appointment of&nbsp;a commission to prepare a collection of statute law </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(leges),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">among which he included the rescripts of the Gregorian&nbsp;and Hermogenian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Codes.</span><span class="font1"> It was published in April 529;&nbsp;and in rapid succession there followed his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fifty Decisions&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(529-532), his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes</span><span class="font1"> (21st November 533), his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digest&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of excerpts from the writings of the jurists (16th December</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">533) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, and the revised edition of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code,</span><span class="font1"> in which he incorporated his own legislation down to date (16th November</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">534) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. From that time down to his death in 565 there&nbsp;followed a series of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Novels (novellae constitutiones),</span><span class="font1"> mostly&nbsp;in Greek, which were never officially collected, and of which&nbsp;probably many have been lost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Taking his enactments in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code</span><span class="font1"> and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Novels</span><span class="font1"> together we have of Justinian’s own legislation about 400 constitutions. Diocletian’s contributions to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code</span><span class="font1"> are&nbsp;about three times as numerous; but most of them professed&nbsp;to be nothing more than short declaratory statements of&nbsp;pre-existing law, whereas Justinian’s, apart from his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fifty&nbsp;Decisions,</span><span class="font1"> were all reformatory enactments, many of them&nbsp;as long as an average Act of Parliament, and dealing with&nbsp;diverse matters under the same rubric. They cover the&nbsp;whole field of law, public and private, civil and criminal,&nbsp;secular and ecclesiastical. It cannot be said that they&nbsp;afford pleasant reading : they are so disfigured by redundancy of language, involved periods, and nauseous self-glorification. But it cannot be denied that many of those&nbsp;which deal with the private law embody reforms of the&nbsp;highest importance and of most salutary tendency. He&nbsp;sometimes loved to pose as the champion of the simplicity&nbsp;and evenhandedness of the early law, at others to denounce&nbsp;it for its subtleties; sometimes he allowed himself to be&nbsp;influenced by his own extreme asceticism, and now and&nbsp;again we detect traces of subservience to the imperious&nbsp;will of his consort; but in the main his legislation was&nbsp;dictated by what he was pleased to call </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">humanitas</span><span class="font1"> so far&nbsp;as the law of persons was concerned, and by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">naturalis ratio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and public utility so far as concerned that of things. The&nbsp;result was the eradication of almost every trace of the old&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus Quiritium,</span><span class="font1"> and the substitution for it, under the name&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus Romanum,</span><span class="font1"> of that cosmopolitan body of law which&nbsp;has contributed so largely to almost every modern system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amendments on the Law of the Family.—</span><span class="font0">With the Christian emperors the last traces disappeared of the old conception of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">familia</span><span class="font0"> as an aggregate of persons and estate subject absolutely to&nbsp;the power and dominion of its head. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manus,</span><span class="font0"> the power in a husband over his wife and her belongings, was a thing of the past;&nbsp;both stood now on a footing of equality before the law ; perhaps&nbsp;it might be more accurate to say, at least with reference to the&nbsp;Justinianian legislation, that the wife was the more privileged of&nbsp;the two in respect both of the protection and the indulgence the law&nbsp;accorded her. With </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> the old confarreation and coemption&nbsp;had ceased, marriage needing nothing more than simple interchange&nbsp;of consent, except as between persons of rank or when the intention was to legitimate previous issue ; in the latter case a written&nbsp;marriage settlement was required, and in the former either such a&nbsp;settlement or a marriage in church before the bishop and at least&nbsp;three clerical witnesses, who granted and signed a certificate of the&nbsp;completed union. The legislation of the Christian emperors on the&nbsp;subject of divorce, largely contributed to by Justinian in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Novels,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">has already been referred to. In regard to dowries many new provisions were introduced, principally for curtailing the husband’s&nbsp;power of dealing with the dowry while the marriage lasted, enlarging&nbsp;the right of the wife and her heirs in respect of it, and simplifying</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
