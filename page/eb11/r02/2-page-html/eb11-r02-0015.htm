The grounds&nbsp;are laid out as a public garden. Near the market house is&nbsp;the site of an ancient chapel dedicated to Thomas à Becket.&nbsp;In the chancel of the parish church of St Mary, a building&nbsp;ranging from Transitional Norman to Perpendicular, is buried&nbsp;Lord Howard, the commander of the English navy against the&nbsp;Spanish Armada. Above the vestry there is a library containing choice manuscripts and rare books. The grammar school&nbsp;was founded in 1675. Among the other public buildings are&nbsp;the town hall, the public hall, the market hall, and the working&nbsp;men’s institute. The borough includes the township of Red-hill, adjacent on the east. The town has some agricultural&nbsp;trade, and in the neighbourhood are quarries for freestone,&nbsp;hearthstone and white sand. The borough is under a mayor,&nbsp;6 aldermen and 18 councillors.

<p><span class="font1">Rcigate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(CherchefeUe, Regat<sub>i</sub> Reygate)</span><span class="font1"> owed its first settlement to its situation at a cross-road on the Pilgrim’s Way, at the foot of the&nbsp;North Downs; and its early importance to the castle which was the&nbsp;stronghold of the De Warcnnes in the 12th, 13th and 14th centuries.&nbsp;On the death of Edith, the widow of Edward the Confessor, to whom&nbsp;it belonged, William 1. secured the manor of Cherchefelle, as it was&nbsp;then called. It was granted by William Rufus to Earl Warenne,&nbsp;through whose family it passed in 1347 to the earls of Arundel. The&nbsp;name Reigate occurs in 1199. Burgesses of Rcigate are mentioned&nbsp;in a close roll of 1348, but no early charter is known. The town was&nbsp;incorporated in 1863. It returned two members to parliament&nbsp;from 1295 till 1831, and afterwards one member only until 1867,&nbsp;when it was disfranchised for corruption. In the reign of Edward I.&nbsp;Earl Warenne held a weekly market on Saturdays, and fairs on&nbsp;Tuesday in Whitsun-week, the eve and day of St Lawrence, and&nbsp;the eve and day of the Exaltation of the Cross, by prescriptive right.&nbsp;Edward IL granted a market on Tuesdays, which is still held. The&nbsp;fair days are now Whit-Tuesday and the 9th of December.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RElMARUS, HERMANN SAMUEL (1694-1768), German philosopher and man of letters, was born at Hamburg; on the&nbsp;22nd of December 1694. He was educated by his father and&nbsp;by the famous scholar J. A. Fabricius, whose son-in-law he&nbsp;subsequently became. He studied theology, ancient languages,&nbsp;and philosophy at Jena, became </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Privatdozenl</span><span class="font0"> in the university&nbsp;of Wittenberg in 1716, and in 1720-21 visited Holland and&nbsp;England. In 1723 he became rector of the high school at&nbsp;Wismar in Mecklenburg, and in 1727 professor of Hebrew&nbsp;and Oriental languages in the high school of his native city.&nbsp;This post he held till his death, though offers of more lucrative&nbsp;positions were made to him. His duties were light, and he&nbsp;employed his leisure in the study of philology, mathematics,&nbsp;philosophy, history, political economy, natural science and&nbsp;natural history, for which he made large collections. His house&nbsp;was the centre of the highest culture of Hamburg, and a monument of his influence in that city still remains in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Haus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">der patriotischen Gesellschaft,</span><span class="font0"> where the learned and artistic&nbsp;societies partly founded by him still meet. He had seven&nbsp;children, only three of whom survived him—the distinguished&nbsp;physician Johann Albrecht Heinrich, and two daughters, one&nbsp;of them being Elise, Lessing’s friend and correspondent. He&nbsp;died on the ist of March 1768.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reimarus’s reputation as a scholar rests on the valuable edition of Dio Cassius (1750-52) which he prepared from the materials&nbsp;collected by J. A. Fabricius. He published a work on logic&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">( Vernunftlehre als Anweisung zum richtigen Gebrauche der&nbsp;Vernunft, 1736,</span><span class="font0"> 5th ed., 1790), and two popular books on the&nbsp;religious questions of the day. The first of these was a collection of essays on the principal truths of natural religion&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Abhandlungen von den vornehmsten Wahrheiten der natürlichen&nbsp;Religion,</span><span class="font0"> 1755, 7th ed., 1798); the second (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Betrachtungen über&nbsp;die Triebe der Thiere,</span><span class="font0"> 1760, 4th ed., 1798) dealt with one particular branch of the same subject. His philosophical position&nbsp;is essentially that of Christian Wolff. But he is best known by&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Apologie oder Schutzschrift für die vernünftigen Verehrer&nbsp;Gottes</span><span class="font0"> (carefully kept back during his lifetime), from which,&nbsp;after his death, Lessing published certain chapters under the&nbsp;title of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">WolfenbUttel Fragments</span><span class="font0"> (see Lessing). The original</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">MS. is in the Hamburg town library; a copy was made for the university library of Göttingen, 1814, and other copies&nbsp;are known to exist. In addition to the seven fragments published by Lessing, a second portion of the work was issued in&nbsp;1787 by C. A. E. Schmidt (a pseudonym), under the title </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Uebrige&nbsp;noch ungedruckte Werke des Wolfenbiittelschen Fragmentisten,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and a further portion by D. W. KJose in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">NiednePs Zeitschrift&nbsp;für historische Theologie,</span><span class="font0"> 1850-52. Two of the five books of&nbsp;the first part and the whole of the second part, as well as appendices on the canon, remain unprinted. But D. F. Strauss has&nbsp;given an exhaustive analysis of the whole work in his book on&nbsp;Reimarus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The standpoint of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Apologie</span><span class="font1"> is that of pure naturalistic deism. Miracles and mysteries arc denied, and natural religion is put forward&nbsp;as the absolute contradiction of revealed. The essential truths of&nbsp;the former are the existence of a wise and good Creator and the&nbsp;immortality of the soul. These truths are discoverable by reason,&nbsp;and are such as can constitute the basis of a universal religion. A&nbsp;revealed religion could never obtain universality, as it could never&nbsp;be intelligible and credible to all men. Even supposing its possibility, the Bible does not present such a revelation. It abounds in&nbsp;error as to matters of fact, contradicts human experience, reason&nbsp;and morals, and is one tissue of folly, deceit, enthusiasm, selfishness&nbsp;and crime. Moreover, it is not a doctrinal compendium, or catechism,&nbsp;which a revelation would have to be. What the Old Testament says&nbsp;of the worship of God is little, and that little worthless, while its&nbsp;writers are unacquainted with the second fundamental truth of&nbsp;religion, the immortality of the soul. The design of the writers of&nbsp;the New Testament, as well as that of Jesus, was not to teach true&nbsp;rational religion, but to serve their own selfish ambitions, in promoting which they exhibit an amazing combination of conscious&nbsp;fraud and enthusiasm. It is important, however, to remember that&nbsp;Reimarus attacked atheism with equal effect and sincerity, and&nbsp;that he was a man of high moral character, respected and esteemed&nbsp;by his contemporaries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Modern estimates of Reimarus may be found in the works of B. Pünjer, O. Pfleiderer and H. Hoffding. Piinjer states the position&nbsp;of Reimarus as follows: “ God is the Creator of the world, and His&nbsp;wisdom and goodness are conspicuous in it. Immortality is&nbsp;founded upon the essential nature of man and upon the purpose of&nbsp;God in creation. Religion is conducive to our happiness ana alone&nbsp;brings satisfaction. Miracles are at variance with the divine&nbsp;purpose; without miracles there could be no revelation ” (Pünjer,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Christian Philosophy of Religion since Kant,</span><span class="font1"> Engl, trans.,&nbsp;PP- </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">55°&quot;57j</span><span class="font1"> which contains an exposition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abhandlungen</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schutzschrift).</span><span class="font1"> Pfleiderer says the errors of Reimarus were that he&nbsp;ignored historical and literary criticism, sources, date, origin, &amp;c.,&nbsp;of documents, and the narratives were said to be either purely&nbsp;divine or purely human. He had no conception of an immanent&nbsp;reason </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Philosophy of Religion,</span><span class="font1"> Eng. trans., vol. i. p. 102). H.&nbsp;Hoffding also has a brief section on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Schutzschrift,</span><span class="font1"> stating&nbsp;its main position as follows: “ Natural religion suffices; a revelation&nbsp;is therefore superfluous. Moreover, such a thing is both physically&nbsp;and morally impossible. God cannot interrupt His own work by&nbsp;miracles; nor can He favour some men above others by revelations&nbsp;which are not granted to all, and with which it is not even possible&nbsp;for all to become acquainted. But of all doctrines that of eternal&nbsp;punishment is.most contrary, Reimarus thinks, to true ideas of God,&nbsp;and it was this point which first caused him to stumble ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(History&nbsp;of Modern Phil.,</span><span class="font1"> Eng. trans. (1900), vol. ii. pp. 12, 13).</span></p>
