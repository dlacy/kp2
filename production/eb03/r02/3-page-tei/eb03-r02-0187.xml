He therefore propoſed to the conſpirators to attack him as he went to offer ſacrifices in the Capitol, or while he was employed in the ſecret pleaſures of the palace. The reſt, however, were of opinion, that it was beſt to fall upon him when he ſhould be unattended ; by which means they would be more certain of ſucceſs. After ſeveral deliberations, it was at laſt reſolved to attack him during the continuance of the Palatine games, which laſted ſour days; and to ſtrike the blow when his guards ſhould have the leaſt opportunity to defend hi u. In conſequence of this, the three firſt days of the games paſted without affording that opportunity which was ſo ardently deſired. Cherea now, therefore, began to apprehend, that deferring the time of the conſpiracy might be a mean to divulge it : he even began to dread, that the honour of killing the tyrant might fall to the lot of ſome other perſon more bold than himſelf. Wherefore, he at laſt reſolved to defer the execution of his plot only to the day following, when Caligula ſhould paſs through a private gallery, to ſome baths not far diſtant from the palace.</p><p>The laſt day of the games was more ſplendid than the reſt ; and Caligula ſeemed more ſprightly and con-deſcending than uſhal. He took great amuſement in ſeeing the people ſeramble for the fruits and other rarities thrown by his order among them ; and ſeemed no way apprehenſive of the plot for r,ed ſor his deſtruction. In the mean time, thé conſpiracy began to tran-ſpire; and had he poſſeſſed any friends, it could not have failed of being diſcovered. The conſpirators waited a great part of the day with the moſt extreme anxiety ; and at one time Caligula ſeemed reſolved to ſpend the whole day without any refreſhment. This unexpected delay entirely exaſperated Cherea; and had he not been reſtrained, he would have gone and perpetrated his deſign in the midſt of all the people. Juſt at that inſtant, while he was yet hefιtating what he ſhould do, Aſprenas, one of the conſpirators, perfuadcd Caligula to go to the bath and take ſome flight refreſhment, in order to enjoy the reſt of the entertainment with greater reliſh. The emperor therefore riling up, the conſpirators uſed every precaution to keep off the throng, and to ſurround him, under pretence of greater affι-duity. Upon entering into the little vaulted gallery that led to the bath, he was met by a band of Grecian children who had been inſtructed in ſinging, and were come to perform in his preſence. He was once more therefore going to return into the theatre with them, had not the leader of the band excuſed himſelf, as having a cold» This was the moment that Cherea ſeized to ſtrike him to the ground ; crying out, “ Tyrant, think upon this.” Immediately after, the other conſpirators ruſhed in; and while the- emperctr continued to refiſt, crying out, that he was not yet dead, they diſpatched hi u with 30 wounds, in the 29th year of his age, after a ſhort reign of three years ten months and eight, days. With him, his wiſe and infant daughter alſo periſhed , the one being ſtabbed by a centurion, the other having its brains daſhed out againſt the walk His coin was alſo melted down by a decree of the ſenate ; and ſuch precautions were taken, that all ſeemed willing, that neither his features nor his name might be tranſmitted to poſterity.</p><p>As ſoon as the death Caligula was made public, it produced the greateſt confuſion in all parts of the city. The conſpirators, who only aimed at deſtroying a tyrant without attending to a ſucceffor, had all ſought ſafety by retiring to private places. Some thought the report of the emperor’s death was only an artifice of his own, to ſee how his enemies would behave. Others averred that he was ſtill alive, and actually in a fair way to recover. In this interval of ſuſpenſe, the German guards finding it a convenient time to pillage, gave a looſe to their licentiouſneſs, under a pretence of revenging the emperor’s death. All the conſpiratora and ſenators that ſell in their way received no mercy ; Aſprenas, Norbanus, and Anteius, were cut in pieces. However, they grew calm hy degrees, and the ſenate was permitted to aſſemble, in order to deliberate upon what w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>as neceſſary to be done in the preſent emergency.</p><p>In this deliberation, Saturninus, who was then con-ſtil, inſiſted much upon the benefits of liberty ; and talked in raptures of Cherea’s fortitude, alleging that it deſerved the higheſt reward. This was a language highly pleaſing to the ſenate. Liberty now became the favourite topic ; and they even ventured to talk of extinguiſhing the very name of Cæſar. Impreſſed with this reſolution, they brought over ſome cohorts of the city to their ſide, and boldly ſeized upon the Capitol. But it was now too late for Rome to regain her priſtine freedom ; the populace and the army oppoſing their endeavours. The former were ſtill mindful of their ancient hatred to the ſenate ; and remembered the donations and public ſpectacles of the emperors with regret. <hi rend="sup">r</hi>Γhe latter were ſenſible they could have no power but in a monarchy ; and had ſome hopes that the election of the emperor would fall to their determination. In this oppoſition of intereſts, and variety of opinions, chance ſeemed at laſt to decide the fate of the empire. Some ſoldiers happening to run about the palace, diſcovered Claudius, Caligula’s uncle, lurking in a ſecret place, where he had hid himſelf through ſear. Of this perſonage, who had hitherto been deſpiſed for his imbecillity, they reſolved to make an emperor : and accordingly carried him upon their ſhoulders to the camp, where they proclaimed him at a time he expected nothing but death.</p><p>The ſenate now, therefore, perceiving that force alone was likely to ſettle the ſucceiſion, were reſolved to fubmit, ſince they had no power to oppoſe. Claudius was the perſon moſt nearly allied to the late emperor, then living ; being the nephew of Tiberius, and the uncle of Caligula. The ſenate therefore paſſed a decree, confirming him in the empire ; and went ſoon after in a body, to render him their compullive homage. Cherea vyas the firſt who fell a ſacriſice to the jealoufy of this new monarch. He met death with all the fortitude of an ancient Roman ; deſiring to die by the ſame ſword with which* he had killed Caligula. Lupus, his friend, was put to death with him ; and Sa-binus, one. of the conſpirators, laid violent hands on himſelf.</p><p>Claudius was 50 years old when he began to reign. The complicated diſeaſes of his infancy had in ſome teeaſure affected all the faculties both of his body and mind. He was continued in a ſtate of pupillage much longer than w<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>as uſual at that time; and ſeemed, in</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
