<p><label>RADCLIFFE, JOHN</label>
(1650-1714), English physician, was born at Wakefield in 1650. He matriculated at University College, Oxford, and after taking his degree in 1669 was elected to a fellowship at Lincoln College, which he gave up in 1677 when, under the statutes of the college, he was called on to take orders. Graduating in medicine in 1675, he practised first in Oxford, but in 1684 removed to London, where he soon became one of the leading physicians. He frequently attended William III. until 1699, when he caused offence by remarking, as he looked at the King’s swollen ankles, that he would not have his legs for his three kingdoms. - On the 1st of November 1714 he died of apoplexy at his house in Carshalton. By his will he left pro-perty to University College for founding two medical travelling fellowships and for other purposes. Other property was put at the disposal of his executors to use as they thought best, and was employed, among other things, in building the Radcliffe Observatory, Hospital and Library at Oxford, and in enlarging St Bartholomew’s Hospital in London. Radcliffe was elected M. P. for Bramber in 1690 and for Buckingham in 1713.</p>
