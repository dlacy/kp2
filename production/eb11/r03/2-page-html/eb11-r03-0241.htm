<p><span class="font2">a mental transformation, which we can trace for 300 years before in visible processes of decay and growth, had reached a&nbsp;crisis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Besides the adoption of Christianity, Constantine<sup>i</sup>S reign is marked by an event only second in importance, the shifting&nbsp;of the centre of gravity of the Empire from the west to the&nbsp;east by making Byzantium a second capital, a second Rome.&nbsp;The foundation of Constantinople </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> determined the subsequent history of the state; it established permanently the&nbsp;division between the eastern and western parts of the Empire&nbsp;—a principle already introduced—and soon exhibited, though&nbsp;not immediately, the preponderance of the eastern half. The&nbsp;eastern provinces were the richest and most resourceful, and&nbsp;only needed a Rome in their midst to proclaim this fact; and&nbsp;further, it was eastward that the Empire fronted, for here was&nbsp;the one great civilized state with which it was in constant&nbsp;antagonism. Byzantium was refounded on the model of Rome,&nbsp;had its own senate, and presently a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">praefcctus urbi.</span><span class="font2"> But its&nbsp;character was different in two ways: it was Christian and it&nbsp;was Greek. From its foundation New Rome had a Christian&nbsp;stamp; it had no history as the capital of a pagan empire.&nbsp;There was, however, no intention of depressing Rome to a&nbsp;secondary rank in political importance; this was brought about&nbsp;by the force of circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Christian Roman Empire, from the first to the last Constantine, endured for 1130 years, and during that long period,&nbsp;which witnessed the births of all the great modern nations of&nbsp;Europe, experienced many vicissitudes of decline and revival.&nbsp;In the $th century it lost all its western provinces through the&nbsp;expansion of the Teutons; but in the 6th asserted something&nbsp;of its ancient power and won back some of its losses. In the&nbsp;7th it was brought very Iow<sup>r</sup> through the expansion of the&nbsp;Saracens and of the Slavs, but in consequence of internal&nbsp;reforms and prudent government in the 8th century was able&nbsp;before the end of the 9th to initiate a new brilliant period of&nbsp;power and conquest. From the middle of the nth century&nbsp;a decline began; besides the perpetual dangers on the eastern&nbsp;and northern frontiers, the Empire was menaced by the political&nbsp;aggression of the Normans and the commercial aggression of&nbsp;Venice; then its capital was taken and its dominions dismembered by Franks and Venetians in 1204. It survived the&nbsp;blow for 250 years, as a shadow of its former self.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During this long life its chief political rôle was that of acting as a defender of Europe against the great powers of western&nbsp;Asia. While it had to resist a continuous succession of dangerous&nbsp;enemies on its northern frontier in Europe—German, Slavonic,&nbsp;Finnic and Tatar peoples—it always considered that its front&nbsp;was towards the east, and that its gravest task was to face&nbsp;the powers which successively inherited the dominion of Cyrus&nbsp;and Darius. From this point of view we might divide the&nbsp;external history of the Empire into four great periods, each&nbsp;marked by a struggle with a different Asiatic power: (1) with&nbsp;Persia, ending </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font2"> 630 with the triumph of Rome; (2) with&nbsp;the Saracens, who ceased to be formidable in the nth century;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Seljuk Turks, in the nth and 12th centuries;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with the Ottoman Turks, in which the Roman power went&nbsp;down.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">AIedieval historians, concentrating their interest on the rising states of western Europe, often fail to recognize the&nbsp;position held by the later Empire and its European prestige.&nbsp;Up to the middle of the nth century it was in actual strength&nbsp;the first power in Europe, except in the lifetime of Charles the&nbsp;Great, and under the Comneni it was still a powær of the first&nbsp;rank. But its political strength does not express the fulness&nbsp;of its importance. As the heir of antiquity it was confessedly&nbsp;superior in civilization, and it was supreme in commerce.&nbsp;Throughout the whole period (to 1204) Constantinople was the&nbsp;first city in the w<sup>r</sup>orld. The influence which the Empire exerted&nbsp;upon its neighbours, especially the Slavonic peoples, is the second&nbsp;great rôle which it fulfilled for Europe—a rôle on which perhaps&nbsp;the most speaking commentary is the doctrine that the Russian&nbsp;Tsar is the heir of the Roman Caesar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Empire has been called by many names* Cireek, Byzantine, Lower (Bas-empire), Eastern (or East-Roman). All these have&nbsp;a certain justification as descriptions, but the only strictly correct&nbsp;name is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Roman</span><span class="font2"> (as recognized in the title of Gibbon’s work). The&nbsp;continuity from Augustus to Constantine XI. is unbroken; the&nbsp;emperor w<sup>r</sup>as always the Roman emperor; his subjects w'ere always&nbsp;Romans </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">('Ρωμαίοι:</span><span class="font2"> hence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Romaic—</span><span class="font2">Modern Greek). “ Greek&nbsp;Empire ” expresses the fact that the state became predominantly&nbsp;Greek in character, owing to the loss, first of the Latin provinces,&nbsp;afterwards of Syria and Egypt; and from the middle of the 6th&nbsp;century Greek became the official language. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“ Lower</span><span class="font2"> Empire ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Later</span><span class="font2"> is preferable) marks the great actual distinction in character&nbsp;between the development before Constantine (Haut-empire) and&nbsp;after his adoption of Christianity. “ Byzantine sums up in a&nbsp;WOrd the unique Gracco-Roman civilization which was centred in&nbsp;New Rome. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eastern</span><span class="font2"> is a term of convenience, but it has been used&nbsp;in tw<sup>r</sup>o senses, not to be confused. It has been used, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">loosely,</span><span class="font2"> to&nbsp;designate the eastern half of the Empire during the 80 years or so&nbsp;(from 395) when there were two lines of emperors, ruling formally&nbsp;as colleagues but practically independent, at Rome and Constantinople; but though there were two emperors, as often before, there&nbsp;was only one Empire, lt has also been used, justifiably, to distinguish the true Koman Empire from the new state founded by&nbsp;Charles the Great (800), which also chimed to be the Roman&nbsp;Empire; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eastern</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Western Empire</span><span class="font2"> are from this date forward&nbsp;legitimate terms of distinction. But between the periods to which the&nbsp;legitimate and Jllegitimate uses of the term “ Eastern Empire ”&nbsp;apply lies a period of more than 300 years, in which there w’as only&nbsp;one Empire in any sense of the word.</span></p>
