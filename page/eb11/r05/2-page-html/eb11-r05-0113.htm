<p><span class="font1">the council Russell, on the 28th of June, acknowledged his presence at the meeting, but denied all knowledge of the proposed&nbsp;insurrection. He reserved his defence, however, until his trial.&nbsp;He would probably have saved his life but for the perjury of&nbsp;Lord Howard. The suicide of Essex, the news of which was&nbsp;brought into court during the trial, was quoted as additional&nbsp;evidence against him, as pointing to the certainty of Essex’s&nbsp;guilt. On July 19 he was tried at the Old Bailey, his wife&nbsp;assisting him in his defence. Evidence was given by an informer that, while at Shaftesbury’s hiding-place in Wapping,&nbsp;Russell had joined in the proposal to seize the king’s guard, a&nbsp;charge indignantly denied by him in his farewell paper, and&nbsp;that he was one of a committee of six appointed to prepare the&nbsp;scheme for an insurrection. Howard, too, expressly declared&nbsp;that Russell had urged the entering into communications&nbsp;with Argyll in Scotland. Howard’s perjury is clear from&nbsp;other witnesses, but the evidence was accepted. Russell spoke&nbsp;with spirit and dignity in his own defence, and, in especial,&nbsp;vehemently denied that he had ever been party to a design&nbsp;so wicked and so foolish as those of the murder of the king and&nbsp;of rebellion. It will be observed that the legality of the trial,&nbsp;in so far as the jurors were not properly qualified and the law&nbsp;of treason was shamefully strained, was denied in the act of&nbsp;1 William &amp; Mary which annulled the attainder. Hallam&nbsp;maintains that the only overt act of treason proved against&nbsp;Russell was his concurrence in the project of a rising at Taunton,&nbsp;which he denied, and which, Ramsay being the only witness,&nbsp;was not sufficient to warrant a conviction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russell was sentenced to die. Many attempts were made to save his life. The old earl of Bedford offered £50,000 or £100,000,&nbsp;and Monmouth, Legge, Lady Ranelagh, and Rochester added&nbsp;their intercessions. Russell himself, in petitions to Charles and&nbsp;James, offered to live abroad if his life were spared, and never&nbsp;again to meddle in the affairs of England. He refused, however,&nbsp;to yield to the influence of Burnet and Tillotson, who endeavoured&nbsp;to make him grant the unlawfulness of resistance, although it is&nbsp;more than probable that compliance in this would have saved&nbsp;his life. He drew up, with Burnet’s assistance, a paper containing his apology, and he wrote to the king a letter, to be&nbsp;delivered after his death, in which he asked Charles’s pardon&nbsp;for any wrong he had done him. A suggestion of escape from&nbsp;Lord Cavendish he refused. He behaved with his usual quiet&nbsp;cheerfulness during his stay in the Tower, spending his last day&nbsp;on earth as he had intended to spend the following Sunday if he&nbsp;had reached it. He received the sacrament from Tillotson, and&nbsp;Burnet twice preached to him. Having supped with his wife,&nbsp;the parting from whom was his only great trial, he slept peacefully, and spent the last morning in devotion with Burnet. He&nbsp;went to the place of execution in Lincoln’s Inn Fields with&nbsp;perfect calmness, which was preserved to the last. He died on&nbsp;the 21st of July 1683, in the forty-fourth year of his age. His&nbsp;attainder was reversed in 1689, and his son Wriothesley (1680-1711) succeeded his grandfather as 2nd duke of Bedford in 1700.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A true and moderate summing-up of his character will be found in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life,</span><span class="font1"> by Lord John Russell (1820).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(0. A.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL OF KILLOWEN, CHARLES RUSSELL, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Baron (1832—</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">i qoo),</span><span class="font1"> lord chief justice of England, was bom at Newry,&nbsp;county Down, on the 10th of November 1832. He was the&nbsp;elder son of Arthur Russell, a Roman Catholic gentleman,&nbsp;who was engaged in commerce and brewing in Newry. Educated first at Belfast, afterwards in Newry, and finally at St&nbsp;Vincent’s College, Castleknock, Dublin, in 1849, he was articled&nbsp;to a firm of solicitors in Newry. In 1854 he was admitted,&nbsp;and began to practise his profession. Disturbances between&nbsp;Roman Catholics and Orangemen were at that time prevalent&nbsp;in this part of Ireland, and in the legal proceedings* which&nbsp;ensued at quarter and petty sessions young Russell distinguished&nbsp;himself as a bold and skilful advocate in the cause of his&nbsp;co-religionists. The political zeal which always formed an&nbsp;important element in Russell’s character happily harmonized&nbsp;with these professional duties. After practising, however, for&nbsp;two years, he determined to seek a wider field for his abilities,&nbsp;and to become a barrister in England. It was a wise ambition,&nbsp;early conceived by young Russell, stimulated by his present&nbsp;success, and encouraged by the counsel of at least one competent&nbsp;adviser, Judge Jones, who was much impressed by Russell’s&nbsp;ability in the conduct of a case at the Newry quarter sessions.&nbsp;He believed, moreover, that to succeed at the Irish bar he would&nbsp;have (to use his own phrase) to “ swallow his convictions.”&nbsp;With this end in view Russell, whilst still practising and residing&nbsp;in Belfast, became a student of Trinity College, Dublin. He&nbsp;matriculated there in 1855, and passed examinations from&nbsp;time to time, but did not wait to become a graduate. In 1856&nbsp;he went to London and became a student of Lincoln’s Inn.&nbsp;In 1858 he married, in Belfast, Ellen, the eldest daughter of&nbsp;Dr Mulholland, a physician of distinction in that city. In&nbsp;1859 he was called to the bar, after gaining by examination&nbsp;a first-class honour certificate, and joined the Northern Circuit.&nbsp;Except some valuable introductions to friends in London and&nbsp;Liverpool, which his uncle, the president of Maynooth, had&nbsp;given to him, Russell brought to the work of his profession no&nbsp;external aids. He had to rely upon himself. But the equipment was sufficient. A well-built frame; a strong, striking&nbsp;face, with broad forehead, keen grey eyes, and a full and sensitive&nbsp;mouth; a voice which, though not musical, was rich, and&nbsp;responded well to strong emotions, whether of indignation,&nbsp;or scorn, or pity; an amazing power of concentrating thought;&nbsp;an intellectual grasp, promptly seizing the real points of the&nbsp;most entangled case, and rejecting all that was secondary, or&nbsp;petty, or irrelevant; a faculty of lucid and forcible, expression,&nbsp;which, without literary ornateness or grace of. style, could on&nbsp;fit occasions rise to impassioned eloquence—all these things&nbsp;Russell had. But beyond and above all these was his immense&nbsp;personality, an embodiment of energetic will which riveted&nbsp;attention, dominated his audience, and bore down opposition.&nbsp;His successful advocacy in the Colin Campbell divorce case in&nbsp;1886, and his famous cross-examination of hostile witnesses&nbsp;and still more famous speech before the Parnell Commission in&nbsp;1888, afforded perhaps the best examples of Russell’s characteristic powers. He was not a learned lawyer in the sense in which&nbsp;Willes, or Mellish, or Blackburn were learned lawyers; he did&nbsp;not possess the fine legal acumen of his great contemporary,&nbsp;Herschell; but he had a sufficient apprehension of legal principles. He handled a point of law with telling directness and&nbsp;force. His argument as the leading counsel for Great Britain&nbsp;in the Bering Sea Arbitration in 1893, <sup>an</sup>d his address at Saratoga&nbsp;Springs on International Law and International Arbitration in&nbsp;August 1896, were expositions of law in its practical application&nbsp;to matters of state which the most learned jurist must admire&nbsp;for their thoroughness and perspicuity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russell’s success, after he joined the Northern Circuit, did not, of course, come to him at once. For some time his work&nbsp;in court was principally in the Court of Passage at Liverpool,&nbsp;which he regularly attended from London. He wrote a book&nbsp;on its procedure, which was published in 1862. This ancient&nbsp;local court, possessing both common law and Admiralty jurisdiction, had as its presiding judge—then styled “assessor”—&nbsp;an eminent leader of the Northern Circuit, Mr Edward James.&nbsp;Substantial commercial cases were tried there, and of these&nbsp;Russell soon had a goodly portion. Steadily, and, for a barrister,&nbsp;speedily, Russell’s fortune grew. His biographer, Mr Barry&nbsp;O’Brien, has given, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Life of Lord Russell of KUlowen</span><span class="font1"> (1901),&nbsp;an account of Russell’s fees, which shows that they were,&nbsp;in round figures:, in 1859, £117; in 1862, £1016; in 1866,&nbsp;£2367; and in 1870, £4230. At the beginning of this period&nbsp;Russell wrote occasionally for the newspapers, and especially&nbsp;for the Irish press. From early boyhood onwards he maintained&nbsp;a keen interest in politics, and pre-eminently in the public affairs&nbsp;of Ireland. In 1859 he published a pamphlet entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Catholic in the Workhouse,</span><span class="font1"> and an article from his pen is to be&nbsp;found in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Dublin Review,</span><span class="font1"> vol. xlviii. p. 497. His legal work&nbsp;was not wholly confined to the north of England. He was&nbsp;employed at the Guildhall and elsewhere by solicitors of position&nbsp;in the City of London. He was one of the counsel engaged in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
