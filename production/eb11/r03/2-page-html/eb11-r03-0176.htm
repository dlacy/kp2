<p><span class="font1">“ emirs,” of whom the greatest was George of Antioch, formerly in the service of the Moslem prince of El Mehdia. Mainly by&nbsp;him a series of conquests were made on the African coast&nbsp;(1135-53) which reached from Tripoli to Cape Bona. The&nbsp;second crusade (1147-48) gave Roger an opportunity to&nbsp;revive Robert Guiscard’s designs on the Greek Empire. George&nbsp;was sent to Corinth at the end of 1147 and despatched an&nbsp;army inland which plundered Thebes. In June 1149 the&nbsp;admiral appeared before Constantinople and defied the Basileus&nbsp;by firing arrows against the palace windows. The attack on&nbsp;the empire had, however, no abiding results. The king died&nbsp;at Palermo on the 26th of February 1154, and was succeeded&nbsp;by his fourth son William.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Personally Roger was of tall and powerful body, with long fair hair and full beard. “ He had,” says Romnald of Salerno,&nbsp;“ a lion face, and spoke with a harsh voice.” With little or&nbsp;none of Robert Guiscard’s personal valour, and living at intervals the life of an eastern Sultan, he yet showed to the full&nbsp;his uncle’s audacity, diplomatic skill and determination. It&nbsp;is Roger II.’s distinction to have united all the Norman conquests into one kingdom and to havc subjected them to a&nbsp;government scientific, personal and centralized. The principles&nbsp;of this are found in the Assizes of the kingdom of Sicily, promulgated at Ariano in 1140, which enforced an almost absolute&nbsp;royal power. At Palermo Roger drew’ round him distinguished&nbsp;men of various races, such as the famous Arab geographer&nbsp;Idrisi and the historian Nilus Doxopatrius. The king’s active&nbsp;and curious mind welcomed the learned; he maintained a&nbsp;complete toleration for the several creeds, races and languages&nbsp;of his realm ; he was served by men of nationality so dissimilar&nbsp;as the Englishman Thomas Brun, a kaid of the Curia, and, in&nbsp;the fleet, by the renegade Moslem Christodoulos, and the&nbsp;Antiochene George, whom he made in 1132 “amiratus amira-torum,” in effect prime vizier. The Capella Palatina, at&nbsp;Palermo, the most wonderful of Roger’s churches, with Norman&nbsp;doors, Saracenic arches, Byzantine dome, and roof adorned&nbsp;with Arabic scripts, is perhaps the most striking product of&nbsp;the brilliant and mixed civilization over which the grandson&nbsp;of the Norman Trancred ruled.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROGER (d. 1139), bishop of Salisbury, was originally priest of a small chapel near Caen. The future King Henry I., who&nbsp;happened to hear mass there one day, was impressed by the&nbsp;speed with which Roger read the service, and enrolled him in&nbsp;his own service. Roger, though uneducated, showed great&nbsp;talent for business, and Henry, on coming to the throne, almost&nbsp;immediately made him chancellor (1101). Soon after Roger&nbsp;received the bishopric of Salisbury. In the Investitures controversy he skilfully managed to keep the favour of both the&nbsp;king and Anselm. Roger devoted himself to administrative&nbsp;business, and remodelled it completely. He created the&nbsp;exchequer system, which was managed by him and his family&nbsp;for more than a century, and he used his position to heap up&nbsp;power and riches. He became the first man in England after&nbsp;the king, and was in office, if not in title, justiciar. He ruled&nbsp;England while Henry was in Normandy, and succeeded in&nbsp;obtaining the see of Canterbury for his nominee, William of&nbsp;Corbeil. Duke Robert seems to have been put into his custody&nbsp;after Tinchebrai. Though Roger had sworn allegiance to&nbsp;Matilda, he disliked the Angevin connexion, and went over to&nbsp;Stéphen, carrying with him the royal treasure and administrative system (1135). Stephen placed great reliance on him,&nbsp;on his nephews, the bishops of Ely and Lincoln, and on his son&nbsp;Roger, who was treasurer. The king declared that if Roger&nbsp;demanded half of the kingdom he should have it, but chafed&nbsp;against the overwhelming influence of the official clique whom&nbsp;Roger represented. Roger himself had built at Devizes the&nbsp;most splendid castle in Christendom. He and his nephews&nbsp;seem to have secured a number of castles outside their own&nbsp;dioceses, and the old bishop behaved as if he were an equal&nbsp;of the king. At a council held in June 1139, Stephen found&nbsp;a pretext for demanding a surrender of their castles, and&nbsp;on their refusal they were arrested. After a short struggle&nbsp;all Roger’s great castles were sequestrated. But Henry of&nbsp;Winchester demanded the restoration of the bishop. The&nbsp;king was considered to have committed an almost unpardonable crime in offering violence to members of the church, in&nbsp;defiance of the scriptural command, “ Touch not mine anointed.”&nbsp;Stephen took up a defiant attitude, and the question remained&nbsp;unsettled. This quarrel with the church, which immediately&nbsp;preceded the landing of the empress, had a serious effect on&nbsp;Stephen’s fortunes. The moment that the fortune of war&nbsp;declared against him, the clergy acknowledged Matilda. Bishop&nbsp;Roger, however, did not live to see himself avenged. He died&nbsp;at Salisbury in December 1139. He was a great bureaucrat,&nbsp;and a builder whose taste was in advance of his age. But his&nbsp;contemporaries were probably justified in regarding him as the&nbsp;type of the bishop immersed in worldly affairs, ambitious,&nbsp;avaricious, unfettered by any high standard of personal&nbsp;morality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roger’s nephew Alexander (d. 1148), who became bishop of Lincoln in 1123, was a typical secular ecclesiastic of the middle&nbsp;ages, wealthy, proud, ambitious and ostentatious. He founded&nbsp;monasteries, built castles at Newark, Sleaford and Banbury,&nbsp;and restored his cathedral at Lincoln after the fire of 1145.&nbsp;He followed the policy of Roger, whose imprisonment he&nbsp;shared, and died after a visit to Pope Eugenius III. at Auxerre,&nbsp;early in 1148.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROGER (d. 1181), archbishop of York, known as Roger of Pont l’Evêque, was a member of the household of Theobald,&nbsp;archbishop of Canterbury, where he quarrelled violently with&nbsp;another future archbishop, Thomas Beckct. In 1148 he was&nbsp;appointed archdeacon of Canterbury, and soon afterwards&nbsp;chaplain to King Stephen, who sent him on an errand to Rome&nbsp;in 1152; then in October 1154 he was consecrated archbishop&nbsp;of York in Westminster Abbey. When Henry II. entered&nbsp;upon his great struggle with Becket over the immunity of clerks&nbsp;from secular jurisdiction, he managed to secure the support of&nbsp;Roger, and having been appointed papal legate in England,&nbsp;the archbishop visited Pope Alexander III. and the French king,&nbsp;Louis VII., in his master’s interests. In June 1170 he crowned&nbsp;the king’s son Henry, in spite of prohibitions from the pope&nbsp;and from Becket, and for this act he was suspended. One&nbsp;authority declares that Roger, who was then with Henry II.&nbsp;in Normandy, instigated the murder of the rival archbishop,&nbsp;but he swore he was innocent of this crime. He quarrelled&nbsp;with Richard, the new archbishop of Canterbury, about the&nbsp;respective rights of the two archiépiscopal sees, until 1176,&nbsp;when the king arranged a truce between them; and he was&nbsp;constantly endeavouring to assert his supremacy over the&nbsp;Scottish church. The archbishop died at York on the 21st&nbsp;of November 1181. He was always loyal to Henry II., to&nbsp;whom he was very useful during the great rising of 1174; but&nbsp;he has been accused of avarice, and he was certainly not lacking&nbsp;in ambition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another English prelate of this name was Roger, bishop of Worcester, a younger son of Robert, earl of Gloucester, and thus a&nbsp;grandson of the English king Henry I. In 1163 his cousin Henry II.&nbsp;appointed him bishop of Worcester, but almost alone of the English&nbsp;bishops he supported Thomas Becket and not the king during the&nbsp;quarrel between them in 1166. In 1167 he left England to share&nbsp;Becket’s exile, but Jie soon returned to court, although he appears&nbsp;to have remained on friendly terms with the archbishop. He died&nbsp;at Tours in 1179.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROGER OF HOVEDEN, or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Howden</span><span class="font1"> (fl. 1174-1201), English chronicler, was, to judge from his name and the internal evidence of his work, a native of Howden in the East Riding&nbsp;of Yorkshire. But nothing is known of him before the year&nbsp;1174. He was then in attendance upon Henry II., by whom</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
