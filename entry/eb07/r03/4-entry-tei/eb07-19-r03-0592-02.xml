a town of Hindustan, the capital of a small district of the same name, in the province of Gund-wana, and district of Choteesgur, of which it is the capital. It is only a straggling village of about a thousand huts, many of which are uninhabited. It is situated in a remarkably productive and fertile country compared with the rest of the province, which is desolate and barren. This place is said to have been in possession of a family of Rajpoot Hindus from time immemorial. Their last independent chief, Sindar Sing, was, after a severe contest, subdued by Rago-gee Bounsia, the founder of the Nagpoor dynasty. It was here that a number of French troops, who were endeavouring to effect a retreat from Bahar through the country into the Deccan, halted, when they were entertained for a few days by Bombajee, the Mahratta sovereign, and at the end of that time treacherously murdered. The travelling distance from Calcutta by Chuta Nagpoor is 493 miles, from Nag-poor 220 miles, from Delhi 633, from Poonah 706 miles. Long. 82. 35. E. Lat. 22. 16. N.</p>
