<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">remarkably well, it became evident that for the worst types of accidents something more was wanted. The brake as first produced was non-automatic, being worked from the engine only, not by the&nbsp;guard. And, since the power had to travel from the engine along&nbsp;the whole length of the train, there was a loss of valuable seconds&nbsp;of time whilst the brake-blocks were being applied. Mr Westing-house therefore designed a system by which each vehicle was supplied&nbsp;with a complete brake apparatus, carrying its own store of power in&nbsp;the form of an auxiliary reservoir of compressed air, in addition to&nbsp;the brake cylinder already there. By the action of the “triple&nbsp;valve ”—a later introduction—which is fitted to each smaller reservoir on the branch by which it is connected to the main or brake-pipe, the brakes can be instantly applied. A store of compressed&nbsp;air is maintained throughout the train in the continuous pipe and&nbsp;auxiliary reservoirs ; and so long as the pressure in these is maintained the brakes are kept off. By a reduction of the pressure&nbsp;in the pipe the triple valve is brought into action, and the compressed air in the reservoir flows into the brake-cylinder and&nbsp;applies the brake. The brake can be at once released by restoring&nbsp;the pressure in the brake-pipe, when the compressed air in the&nbsp;cylinder escapes into the atmosphere. In the event of a train&nbsp;being parted and the brake-pipe severed, the escape of air reduces&nbsp;the pressure in the pipe, and the brakes are instantly self-applied.&nbsp;They have thus become known as “ automatic ” brakes. The compressed air by the agency of which the Westinghouse automatic</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">brake is worked is stored in a main reservoir on the engine, as well as in the local reservoirs under the carriages, at a pressure of&nbsp;from 70 to 80 lb per square inch. The air is compressed by means&nbsp;of a steam-pump attached to the engine and worked by steam from&nbsp;the boiler. The compressed air is supplied through the brake-pipe,&nbsp;which passes through the whole length of the train to the secondary reservoirs. A brake-cylinder is fixed near each secondary reservoir, and the charge enters the cylinder at the middle of its length&nbsp;between the pistons, which are driven apart, one towards each end&nbsp;of the cylinder, and act, through piston-rods and levers, upon the&nbsp;brake-blocks which are applied to the wheels. The pistons are&nbsp;maintained in their central positions in the brake-cylinder, when&nbsp;out of action, by spiral springs which abut on the ends of the&nbsp;cylinders; and so the brake-blocks are kept clear of the wheels.&nbsp;The general arrangement of the brake-apparatus applied to a carriage is shown in fig. 44; and the reservoir and brake-cylinder,&nbsp;with their connexions to each other and to the main pipe, and the&nbsp;intermediary triple valve in section, are shown on a larger scale in&nbsp;fig. 45. The triple valve, by means of which instant automatic action throughout the train is produced, consists of a piston in a short&nbsp;cylinder, carrying a slide valve,—the piston and the valve moving&nbsp;together. A vehicle out of order can be cut out of the system by&nbsp;turning a tap, and brakes which have been applied by the parting&nbsp;of a train can be released by opening a valve on the cylinder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1874 a royal commission on railway accidents was appointed, and in June 1875 brake trials were made at Newark. On a level&nbsp;road a train, weighing 2086־ tons, running at a speed of 511 miles&nbsp;per hour, and fitted with the Westinghouse automatic pressure-brake—there tested for the first time on an English railway—was&nbsp;brought to a stand in a distance of 825 feet in the course of 18&nbsp;seconds,—the equivalent distance for an initial speed of 50 miles&nbsp;per hour being 777 feet. In trials on the North-Eastern Kailway</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">in July 1879, a train, fitted with the Westinghouse brake, weighing 208 tons, and running at a speed of 51 miles per hour, was stopped&nbsp;in a distance of 621 feet in 14f seconds,—the equivalent distance&nbsp;for a speed of 50 miles per hour being 594 feet. In August 1877&nbsp;the Board of Trade urged the railway companies to united and&nbsp;harmonious action, and stated the requirements which in their&nbsp;opinion were essential in a good continuous brake : it should be—&nbsp;efficient in stopping trains; instantaneous in action and easily&nbsp;applied by engine-drivers or guards ; in case of accident instantaneously self-acting; capable of being put on or taken off with&nbsp;facility, on the engine, tender, and eveiy vehicle of a train ; regu-lai־ly used in daily working; and the materials employed easily&nbsp;maintained and kept in order. That a brake should be instantaneous in action is evident on considering that at a speed of 50&nbsp;miles per hour a train advances through 73 J feet in a second of&nbsp;time. A striking example of the value of seconds under such circumstances is quoted in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Report,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> contrasting the working of the&nbsp;Westinghouse compressed-air brake and the Westinghouse vacuum-brake. The rates of speed were nearly the same,—about 52 miles&nbsp;per hour, or 76 feet per second. The train with the former brake&nbsp;ran 825 feet, whilst that with the latter ran 1533 feet. Now, it&nbsp;took </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">7 i</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> seconds to put on the vacuum-brakes and 1^ seconds to&nbsp;put on the pressure-brakes. The difference, seconds, at 76 feet&nbsp;per second, makes a space of 475 feet traversed by the train before&nbsp;the brake came into action. In consequence of these steps taken&nbsp;by the Board of Trade all the large railway companies have now&nbsp;(1885) adopted continuous brakes, though some of these do not&nbsp;comply with the conditions of the Board of Trade. The principal&nbsp;question is not now that of Automatic </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">rerms</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> non-automatic, but of&nbsp;automatic pressure-brakes </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">verms</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> automatic vacuum-brakes. In&nbsp;the latter, as the name indicates, the work is done by the atmospheric pressure against the pressure of a comparative vacuum. At&nbsp;31st December 1878 only 21 per cent, of the total carriage stock was&nbsp;fitted with brakes of some form, of which 128־ per cent, were automatic ; whilst at 30th June 1884 of the total carriage stock 76 per&nbsp;cent, was fitted with continuous brakes, of which 58 per cent,&nbsp;were automatic.- It appears that there are in the United Kingdom&nbsp;considerably more Westinghouse automatic brakes in operation&nbsp;than any other single system. The same brake is very largely, used&nbsp;in America and on the Continent, and at the end of 1884 it had&nbsp;been adopted to the extent of upwards of 15,000 sets for locomotives&nbsp;and 78,000 for carriages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The employment of electricity in the working of railways has already been referred to in the application of block-signalling to&nbsp;the direction of the traffic, in the working of junctions, the protection of stations and sidings, and the repetition of signals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The first attempt to apply electric power for propulsion on railways was made by Mr R. Davidson, who in September 1842 tried on the Edinburgh and Glasgow Railway an electro-magnetic locomotive, running on four wheels and weighing 5 tons. A speed of&nbsp;4 miles per hour was attained. Electric power was applied in 1881&nbsp;by Messrs Siemens and Halske of Berlin on an electric railway, the&nbsp;Lichterfelde line, near Berlin ; and since then they have constructed an electric line 14 miles long, from Charlottenburg to the&nbsp;Spandauer Bock, and a short line in Costverloren Park near Amsterdam. They also applied the system to a railway in the mines&nbsp;at Zankerode in Saxony. At the International Electric Exhibition&nbsp;in Paris (1881) an electric line was worked by Messrs Siemens&nbsp;Brothers which carried an average of over 13,000 passengers per&nbsp;week ; and in September 1883 a railway of 3 feet gauge, 6 miles&nbsp;in length, was opened between Portrush and Bushmills in the</span></p>
