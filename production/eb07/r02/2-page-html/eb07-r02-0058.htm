<p><span class="font0">The largest arch is forty feet span, and the others thirty feet. The length is 560 feet, and the breadth twenty-four&nbsp;feet between the parapets. The river Medway is capable&nbsp;of receiving the largest vessels up to Rochester, but few&nbsp;are moored off the city, as Chatham, a mile lower down the&nbsp;river, is more convenient from the vicinity to the naval arsenal and the docks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ancient castle is an interesting object to all antiquaries. It stands on the south-west side of the city, on such an elevated spot that it can be seen at thirty miles distance.&nbsp;The streets of this city have no peculiar feature, except the&nbsp;narrowness and length ; for in fact it consists chiefly of a&nbsp;single street, which is a continuation of Stroud towards the&nbsp;west and of Chatham towards the east, forming two rows of&nbsp;moderate houses, more than two miles from one end to the&nbsp;other, with a few short streets or lanes leading from them&nbsp;southward. With the exception of the cathedral, hereafter&nbsp;to be noticed, the town-hall is the most remarkable edifice :&nbsp;it was built in 1687. It is a handsome structure, with a&nbsp;spacious entrance-hall and staircase, the ceilings of both&nbsp;which are very curiously ornamented. Here the city business&nbsp;is transacted ; and at the back part is the city jail. There&nbsp;is a free school, several charitable institutions, a customhouse, and a market-house. The diocese of Rochester is the&nbsp;smallest in the kingdom. It had a cathedral as early as the&nbsp;year 600, which was destroyed by Ethelbert, king of Mercia,&nbsp;in 676 ; and a few years after the city suffered much by the&nbsp;incursions of the Danes, but appears to have recovered some&nbsp;degree of respectability by the accession of King Athelstan,&nbsp;who appointed masters of the mint to superintend the coinage of money. The cathedral had been dilapidated at the&nbsp;Norman conquest ; but Gundulph, who was removed from&nbsp;Normandy to fill the see, acquired money sufficient to rebuild the sacred edifice, though he died in 1094, before it&nbsp;was finished. Like most of the more ancient ecclesiastical&nbsp;erections, its plan is an improvement on the basilica of&nbsp;Rome, and it is built in the form of the cross of Christ,&nbsp;with a massive square tower at the point of intersection.&nbsp;The interior space to the west of the cross was the nave or&nbsp;body of the church, which represented the ship of St Peter :&nbsp;this part is more ancient than the nave of any other cathedral in the kingdom, and still retains most of the peculiar&nbsp;features of the style in which it was originally built, and is&nbsp;indeed one of the most interesting specimens of Norman&nbsp;architecture. The whole length of this nave is a hundred&nbsp;and fifty feet, and its breadth between the pillars thirty-three feet, and from one wall to the other seventy-five feet.&nbsp;The choir has an ascent of tcn steps, and is a hundred and&nbsp;fifty-six feet in length. The western front of the cathedral,&nbsp;one of the most perfect specimens of Anglo-Norman architecture, was constructed with consummate ability at a period when the art had arrived at a high point of perfection.&nbsp;The centre door is formed of a semicircular arch, composed&nbsp;of rich mouldings, and is supported by four pillars, with capitals of wreathed foliage. Two of these pillars take the form&nbsp;of Caryatides, and present statues of King Henry I. and his&nbsp;queen Matilda, the daughter of Malcolm III. king of Scotland, being undoubtedly two of the most ancient statues&nbsp;remaining in England. This building presents many other&nbsp;objects of very high interest to the student and the admirer&nbsp;of ancient architecture. The cathedral contains but few&nbsp;monuments, and none with any striking peculiarity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rochester is not a place of much trade, except what arises from the great number of travellers passing through&nbsp;it in their way by Dover to and from the continent. The&nbsp;chief occupation is a considerable oyster-fishery, from beds&nbsp;in the river Medway, which river is under the concurrent&nbsp;jurisdiction of its own corporate body, and that of the lord-mayor and aldermen of London. The latter body make&nbsp;periodical visits of conservancy by water, and on such occasions the two corporations indulge together in sumptuous</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">festivity. For municipal purposes, the city is divided into three wards, and is governed by a mayor, six aldermen, and&nbsp;seventeen councillors. The recorder and justices of the&nbsp;peace are appointed by the crown. The city returns two&nbsp;members to parliament. There is a well-supplied market&nbsp;on Fridays, and several annual fairs. The population amounted in 1821 to 8795, and in 1831 to 9811.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCHFORD, a market-town of the county of Essex, in the hundred of the same name, thirty-nine miles from&nbsp;London. It is situated on a small river that empties itself&nbsp;into the Crouch. It has a good market on Thursday. The&nbsp;population amounted in 1801 to 1228, in 1811 to 1214, in&nbsp;1821 to 1382, and in 1831 to 1256.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCKET, an artificial fire-work, consisting of a cylindrical case of paper, filled with a composition of certain combustible ingredients ; which, being tied to a stick,&nbsp;mounts into the air, and then bursts. See Pyrotechny.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCKY Mountains, a great mountain chain which traverses the western part of North America, extending&nbsp;from about latitude 70° north to Mexico, where it is continued by the Cordilleras of the Andes. These ranges are&nbsp;considered as forming part of one vast chain, which in South&nbsp;America, near the equator, attains its greatest elevation.&nbsp;At the Isthmus of Panama it is so low as nearly to disappear; but this is in conformity with the narrowness of&nbsp;the land in that quarter, and but for a short space. This&nbsp;slight interruption is not sufficient to entitle us to consider the continuity as broken, so that we have in the western&nbsp;hemisphere one great mountain range extending along both&nbsp;continents, from the Polar Sea on the north, to Cape Horn&nbsp;on the south, a distance of more than one hundred and&nbsp;twenty degrees of latitude, without including the windings.&nbsp;The eastern side of North America is traversed by a similar range of mountains called the Alleghanies, which stretch&nbsp;along in continued and parallel lines ; but the extent,&nbsp;breadth, and height of the Rocky Mountains are much&nbsp;greater than those of the former. It is however supposed&nbsp;that the Rocky Mountains extend along the western part&nbsp;of the continent, at about the same distance from the Pacific Ocean that the Alleghanies on the eastern side extend&nbsp;from the Atlantic Ocean. Although but partially explored,&nbsp;the primitive character of the Rocky Mountains is clearly&nbsp;established. Their eastern sides are covered to the height&nbsp;of two hundred or three hundred feet, with a sandstone&nbsp;consisting of the ruins of the granitic rocks upon which it&nbsp;reposes, where disintegration was apparently effected by&nbsp;the gradual agency of an ancient ocean, once occupying&nbsp;the immense plain or basin now extending eastward from&nbsp;the base of these mountains to the chain of the Alleghanies. They have not however been sufficiently explored&nbsp;to admit our advancing any scientific details in regard to&nbsp;them. Many of the detached mountains and prominent&nbsp;peaks have not yet been either named, classified, or described. It does not appear that many of them rise above&nbsp;the region of perpetual refrigeration. But we have the&nbsp;concurrent testimony of Lewis and Clarke, as well as others,&nbsp;that in latitude 47<sup>c</sup> north, immense quantities of snow are&nbsp;on their summits, between the Missouri and Columbia, in&nbsp;the months of June and July. They are seen like a vast&nbsp;rampart rising from the grassy plains, stretching from north&nbsp;to soutll. Sometimes their aspect is that of continued&nbsp;ranges of a grayish colour, rising into the blue of the atmosphere, above the region of the clouds. A grcat number are black, ragged, and precipitous ; and their bases are&nbsp;strewn with· immense boulders and fragments of rock, detached by earthquakes and the elements. From this iron-bound and precipitous character they probably received&nbsp;the appellation of Rocky Mountains. Some of the peaks&nbsp;are supposed to be twelve or thirteen thousand feet in&nbsp;height ; and the general range is considerably higher than&nbsp;any other in North America, with the exception of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
