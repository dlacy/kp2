<p><span class="font0">To ſuch a vaſt variety of people, nations, and languages, it is needleſs to obſerve, that no general character can with truth be applied. The native Ruffians are ſtigmatiſed by their neighbours as ignorant and brutal,&nbsp;totally refigned to ſloth, and addicted to drunkenneſs,&nbsp;even in the moſt beaſtly exceſs ; nay, they are accuſed&nbsp;of being arbitrary, perfidious, inhuman, and deſtitute&nbsp;of every ſocial virtue. There is not a phraſe in their&nbsp;language analogous to ours, “ the manners or the ſentiments of a gentleman nor does </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentleman</span><span class="font0"> with them&nbsp;expreſs any thing moral. Indeed they have no ſuch&nbsp;diſtinction. Cunning is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proſeſſed and gloried in</span><span class="font0"> by all ;&nbsp;and the nobleman whom you detect telling a lie is vexed, but not in the leaſt aſhamed. In the whole </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reglement</span><span class="font0"> of the marine by Peter the Great, there is not&nbsp;one word addreffed to the honour, or even to the probity, oſ his officers. Hopes of reward, and the conſtant&nbsp;fear of detection and puniſhment, are the only motives&nbsp;touched on. In every ſhip of war, and in every regiment, there is a fiſcal or authorized ſpy, a man of re-ſpectable rank, whoſe letters muſt not be opened but&nbsp;at the riſk of the great knout (ſee Knout) ; and&nbsp;he is required by expreſs ſtatute to give monthly reports of the behaviour of the officers and privates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such regulations we cannot think well adapted to improve the morals of the people ; yet we believe they have been improved by the care, aſſiduity, and example of ſome of their late ſovereigns. Certain it is,&nbsp;the vice of drunkenneſs was ſo univerſally prevalent&nbsp;among them, that Peter I. was obliged to reſtrain it&nbsp;by very ſevere edicts, which, however, have not produced much effect. They numbered in the city of&nbsp;Moſcow no fewer than 4000 brandy-ſhops, in which the&nbsp;inhabitants uſed to ſot away their time in drinking&nbsp;ſtrong liquors and ſmoking tobacco. This laſt practice&nbsp;became ſo dangerous, among perſons in the moſt beaſtly&nbsp;ſtate of intoxication, that a very ſevere law was found&nbsp;neceffary to prevent the pernicious conſequences, otherwiſe the whole city might have been conſumed by conflagrations. The nobility were heretofore very powerful,&nbsp;each commanding a great number of vaffals, whom&nbsp;they ruled with the moſt deſpotic and barbarous authority: but their poffeſſions have been gradually circ∏m-ſcribed, and their power transferred in a great meaſure&nbsp;to the czar, on whom they are now wholly dependent.&nbsp;At preſent there is no other degree of the nobility but&nbsp;that of the boyars : theſe are admitted to the council,&nbsp;and from among them the waivodes, governors, and other&nbsp;great officers, are nominated, and their ranks with reſpect to each other are regulated by the importance of&nbsp;their refpective offices.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alexis, who introduced this order of precedency, abhorred the perſonal abaſement of the inferior claffes to their ſuperiors, wſhich he would not accept of when exhibited to himſelf ; and it may appear ſurprifing that&nbsp;Peter, who deſpiſed mere ceremonials, ſhould have encouraged every extravagance of this kind. In a few&nbsp;years of his reign, the beautiful ſimplicity of defignation and addreſs wſhich his father had encouraged was&nbsp;forgotten, and the cumberſome and almoſt ineffable titles&nbsp;which diſgrace the little courts of Germany were crowded into the language of Ruſſia. He enjoined the loweſt&nbsp;order of gentlemen to be addreffed by the phraſe,&nbsp;year </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">reſpeCiable birth</span><span class="font0"> ; the next rank, by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">your high good&nbsp;birth ;</span><span class="font0"> the third, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">your excellence ;</span><span class="font0"> the fourth, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">your&nbsp;high excellence ;</span><span class="font0"> then came </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">your brilliancy</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">high&nbsp;brilliancy. Highneſs</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">majejly</span><span class="font0"> were reſerved for the&nbsp;great duke and the czar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tlieſe titles and modes of addreſs w<sup>r</sup>ere ordered with all the regularity of the manual exerciſe ; and the man&nbsp;who ſhould omit any of them wſhen ſpeaking to his fn-perior might be lawfully beaten by the offended boyar.&nbsp;Before this period, it was polite and courtly to ſpeak&nbsp;to every man, even the heir apparent, by adding his father’s name to his own ; and to the great duke, Paul&nbsp;Petrovιtz was perfectly reſpectful, or a fingle word,&nbsp;ſignifying </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dear father,</span><span class="font0"> wſhen he was not named. Tho<sup>,&nbsp;</sup>pompous titles w<sup>,</sup>ere unknown among them before the&nbsp;era of Peter, the ſubordination of ranks was more complete than in any other European nation ; but with this&nbsp;ſimplicity peculiar to them and the Poles, that they had&nbsp;but three ranks, the ſovereign, the nobleſſe or gentry,&nbsp;and the ſerfs. It was not till very lately that the&nbsp;mercantile rank formed any diſtinction ; and that diſtinction is no more than the freedom of the perfon, which&nbsp;was fυιmerly a transferable commodity belonging to&nbsp;the boyar. Notwſithſtanding this ſimplicity, which put&nbsp;all gentlemen on a level, the ſubſcription of a perſon&nbsp;holding an inferior office was not </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſervant,</span><span class="font0"> but</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ßave;</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;the legal word for a petition in form was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lchelobitii,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">wſhich fιp<sup>-</sup>nifies, “ a beatinπ<sup>r</sup> with the forehead,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> ſtri-king the ground with the forehead; which was actually&nbsp;done. The father of Alexis aboliſhed the practice ;&nbsp;but at this day, when a Ruffian petitions you, he&nbsp;touches his forehead witlι his finger ; and if he be very&nbsp;earneſt, he then puts his finger to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Ruffian nobles formerly wore long beards, anſt long robes with ſtrait ileeves dangling down to their&nbsp;ancles : their collars and ſhirts w<sup>r</sup>ere generally wrought&nbsp;with filk of different colours : in lieu of hats, they covered their heads w<sup>,</sup>ith furred caps ; and, inſtead oſ&nbsp;ſlioes, wore red or yellow leathern bufkins. The dreſs&nbsp;of the women nearly reſembled that of the other ſex ;&nbsp;with this difference, that their garments were more&nbsp;looſe, their caps fantaſtical, and their ſhift-ileeves three&nbsp;or four ells in length, gathered up in folds from the&nbsp;ſhoulder to the fore-arm. By this time, however, the&nbsp;French faſhions prevail among the better fort throughout all Muſcovy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The common people, are generally tall, healthy, and robuſt, patient of cold and hunger, inured to hard-ſhips, and remarkably capable of bearing the moſt bidden traufition from the extremes of hot or cold weather. Nothing is more cuſtomary than to ſee a Ruffian, who is over-heated and ſweating at every pore,&nbsp;ſtrip himſelf naked, and plunge into a river ; nay, when&nbsp;their pores are all opened in the hot bath, to which&nbsp;they have daily recourſe, they either practiſe this immersion, or ſubject themſelves to a diſcharge of ſome&nbsp;pailfuls of cold water. This is the cuſtom of both men&nbsp;and women, who ef⅛ter the baths promiſcuouily, and&nbsp;appear naked to each other, without ſcruple or hefιtation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A Ruffian will ſubſiſt for many days upon a little oatmeal and water, and even raw roots : an onion is&nbsp;a regale ; but the food they generally uſe in their journeys is a kind of rye-bread, cut into ſmall ſquare pieces,&nbsp;and dried again in the oven : theſe, when they are&nbsp;hungry, they foak in water, and eat as a very com-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
