<p><span class="font1">limits of the Latin lowlands. The fame of the capture of Rome by the Celts had reached Athens, and her subsequent victories&nbsp;over marauding Celtic bands had given her prestige in South</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Italy as a bulwark against northern barbarians. In 354 she had formed her first connexions beyond the&nbsp;Liris by a treaty with the Samnitcs, and in 348 followed&nbsp;a far more important treaty with the great maritime state of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Carthage.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rome had won her supremacy from the Ciminian forest to the Liris as the champion of the comparatively civilized communities of the lowlands against the rude highland&nbsp;tribes which threatened to overrun them, and so, when&nbsp;her legions first crossed the Liris, it was in answer to&nbsp;an appeal from a lowland city against invaders from&nbsp;the hills. While she was engaged in clearing Latium&nbsp;of Volsci and Aequi, the Sabcllian tribes of the central&nbsp;Apennines had rapidly spread over the southern half of the&nbsp;peninsula. Foremost among theso tribes were the Samnites,&nbsp;a portion of whom had captured the Etruscan city of Capua in&nbsp;423, the Greek Cumae in 420, and had since then ruled&nbsp;as masters over the fertile Campanian territory. But&nbsp;in their new homes the conquerors soon lost all sense of relationship and sympathy with their highland brethren. They&nbsp;dwelt in cities, amassed Wealth, and inherited the civilization&nbsp;of the Greeks and Etruscans whom they had dispossessed;@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>above all, they had before long to defend themselves in their&nbsp;turn against the attacks of their ruder kinsmen from the hills,&nbsp;and it was for aid against these that the Samnites of Campania&nbsp;appealed to the rising state which had already made herself&nbsp;known as the bulwark of the lowlands north of the Liris, and&nbsp;which with her Latin and Hernican allies had scarcely less&nbsp;interest than the Campanian cities themselves in checking the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">raids of the highland Samnite tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Campanian appeal was listened to. Rome with her confederates entered into alliance with Capua and the neighbouring- Campanian towns, and war was formally&nbsp;declared (343) against the Samnites.@@<sup>3</sup> While to the&nbsp;Latins and Hernicans was entrusted apparently the&nbsp;defence of Latium and the Hernican valley against&nbsp;the northerly members of the Samnite confederacy, the Romans&nbsp;themselves undertook the task of driving the invaders out of&nbsp;Campania. After two campaigns the war was ended in&nbsp;341 by a treaty, and the Samnites withdrew from the&nbsp;lowlands, leaving Rome the recognized suzerain of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Campanian cities which had sought her aid.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is no doubt that the check thus given by Rome to the advance of the hitherto invincible Sabellian highlanders not&nbsp;only made her the natural head and champion of the low&nbsp;countries, south as well as north of the Liris, but also considerably added to her prestige. Carthage sent her congratulations,&nbsp;and the Etruscan city of Falerii voluntarily enrolled herself&nbsp;among the allies of Rome. Of even greater service, however,&nbsp;was the fact that for fifteen years the Samnites remained quiet,&nbsp;for this inactivity, whatever its cause, enabled Rome triumphantly to surmount a danger which threatened for the moment&nbsp;to wreck her whole position. This danger was nothing less&nbsp;than a desperate effort on the part of nearly all her allies and&nbsp;dependants south of the Tiber to throw off the yoke of her supremacy. The way was led by her ancient confederates&nbsp;the Latini, whose smouldering discontent broke into&nbsp;open flame directly the fear of a Samnite attack was&nbsp;removed. From the Latin Campagna and the Sabine hills&nbsp;the revolt spread westward and southward to Antium and&nbsp;Tarracina, and even to the towns of the Campanian plain,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">where the mass of the inhabitants at once repudiated the alliance formed with Rome by the ruling class. The struggle&nbsp;was sharp but short. In two pitched battles<sup>@@5</sup> the strength of&nbsp;the insurrection was broken, and two more campaigns sufficed&nbsp;for the complete reduction of such of the insurgent communities&nbsp;as still held out. The revolt crushed, Rome set herself deliberately to the task of re-establishing on a new and firmer&nbsp;basis her supremacy over the lowlands, and in doing&nbsp;so laid the foundations of that marvellous organization&nbsp;which was destined to spread rapidly over Italy,&nbsp;and to withstand the attacks even of Hannibal. The old&nbsp;historic Latin league ceased to exist, though its memory was&nbsp;still preserved by the yearly Latin festival on the Alban Mount.&nbsp;Most if not all of the common land of the league became Roman&nbsp;territory;@@<sup>6</sup> five at least of the old Latin cities were compelled&nbsp;to accept the Roman franchise@@<sup>7</sup> and enter the pale of the Roman&nbsp;state. The rest, with the Latin colonies, were ranked as Latin&nbsp;allies of Rome, but on terms which secured their complete&nbsp;dependence upon the sovereign city. The policy of isolation,&nbsp;which became so cardinal a principle of Roman rule, was now&nbsp;first systematically applied. No rights of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">conubium</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">com-mercium</span><span class="font1"> were any longer to exist between these communities.&nbsp;Their federal councils were prohibited, and all federal action&nbsp;independent of Rome forbidden.@@<sup>8</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Campania and the coast-lands connecting Campania with Rome, a policy of annexation was considered safer than that&nbsp;of alliance. Of the two frontier posts of the Volsci,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Antium and Velitrae, the former was constituted </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">Roman colony, its long galleys burnt and their&nbsp;prows set up in the Forum at Rome, while the walls of&nbsp;Velitrae were razed to the ground, its leading men banished&nbsp;beyond the Tiber, and their lands given to Roman settlers.&nbsp;Farther south on the route to Campania, Fundi and Formiae&nbsp;were, after the precedent set in the case of Caere, declared&nbsp;Roman and granted the civil rights of Roman citizenship, while&nbsp;lastly in Campania itself the same status was given to Capua,&nbsp;Cumae, and the smaller communities dependent upon them@@</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">During the ten years from 338 to 328 the work of settlement was steadily continued. Tarracina, like&nbsp;Antium, was made a Roman colony. Privernum, the last&nbsp;Volscian town to offer resistance to Rome, was subdued&nbsp;<sup>ln</sup> 330» part of its territory allotted to Roman citizens,&nbsp;and the state itself forced to accept the Roman franchise.&nbsp;Lastly, to strengthen the lines of defence against the Sabellian&nbsp;tribes, two colonies with the rights of Latin allies were established at Cales (334) and at Fregellae (328). The&nbsp;settlement of the lowlands was accomplished. As a&nbsp;single powerful and compact state with an outer circle of&nbsp;closely dependent allies, Rome now stood in sharp contrast&nbsp;with the disunited and degenerate cities of northern Etruria,&nbsp;the loosely organized tribes of the Apennines, and the decaying&nbsp;and disorderly Greek towns of the south.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The strength of this system was now to be tried by a struggle with the one Italian people who were still ready and able to&nbsp;contest with Rome the supremacy of the peninsula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The passive attitude of the Samnites between 342 and 327 was no doubt largely due to the dangers which&nbsp;had suddenly threatened them in South Italy. But&nbsp;the death of Alexander of Epirus, in 332,@@<sup>10</sup> removed&nbsp;their only formidable opponent there, and left them&nbsp;free to turn their attention to the necessity of checking the&nbsp;steady advance of Rome. In 327, the year after the&nbsp;ominous foundation of a Roman colony at Fregellae,&nbsp;a pretext for renewing the struggle was offered them. The</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
