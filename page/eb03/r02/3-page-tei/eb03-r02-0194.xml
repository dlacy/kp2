He was often heard to obſerve, that he had rather be hated than loved. When one happened to ſay in his preſence, That the world might be burned when he was dead:    Nay,” replied</p><p>Nero, " let it be burnt while I am alive.” In fact, a great part of the city of Rome was conſumed by fire ſhortly after. This remarkable conflagration took place in the nth year of Nero’s reign. The fire began among certain ſhops, in which were kept ſuch goods as were proper to feed it ; and ſpread every way with ſuch amazing rapidity, that its havock was felt in diſtant ſtreets, before any meaſures to flop it could be tried. Beſides an infinite number of common houſes, all the noble monuments of antiquity, all the ſtately palaces, temples, porticoes, with goods, riches, furniture, and merchandize, to an immenſe value, were devoured by the flames, which raged firſt in the low regions of the city, and then mounted to the higher with ſuch terrible violence and impetuoſity, as to fruſtrate all relief. The ſhrieks of the women, the various efforts of ſome endeavouring to ſave the young and tender, of others attempting to aſſiſt the aged and infirm, and the hurry of ſuch as ſtrove only to provide for themſelves, occaſioned a mutual interruption and univerſal confuſion. Many, while they chiefly regarded the danger that purſued them from behind, found themſelves ſuddenly involved in the flames before and on every ſide. If they eſcaped into the quarters adjoining, or into the parts quite remote, there too they met with the devouring flames. At laſt, not knowing whither to fly, nor where to ſeek ſanctuary, they abandoned the city, and repaired to the open fields. Some, out of deſpair for the loſs of their whole ſubſtance, others, through tenderneſs for their children and relations, whom they had not been able to ſnatch from the flames, ſuffered themſelves to periſh in them, though they might eaſily have found means to eſcape. No man dared to ſtop the progreſs of the fire, there being many who had no other buſineſs hut to prevent with repeated menaces all attempts of that nature ; nay, ſome were, in the face of the public, ſeen to throw lighted fire-brands into the houſes, loudly declaring that they were authoriſed ſo to do ; but whether this was only a device to plunder more freely, or in reality they had ſuch orders, was never certainly known.</p><p>Nero, who was then at Antium, did not offer to return to the city, till he heard that the flames were advancing to his palace, which, after his arrival, was, in ſpite of all oppoſition, burnt down to the ground, with all the houſes adjoining to it. However, Nero, affecting compaſſion for the multitude, thus vagabond and bereft of their dwellings, laid open the field of Mars, and all the great edifices erected there by Agrippa, and even his own gardens. He likewiſe cauſed tabernacles to be reared in haſte for the reception of the forlorn populace ; from Oſtia, too, and the neighbouring cities, were brought, by his orders, all ſorts of furniture and neceſſaries, and the price of corn was conſiderably leſſened. But theſe bounties, however generous and popular, were beſtowed in vain, becauſe a report &gt;as ſpread abroad, that, during the time of this gent.</p><p>ral conflagration, he mounted his domeſtſe ſtage, and ſung the deſtruction of Troy, comparing the preſent deſolation to the celebrated calamities of antiquity. At length, on the ſixth day, the fury of the flames was flopped at the foot of mount Eſquiline, by levelling with the ground an infinite number of buildings ; ſo that the fire found nothing to encounter but the open fields and empty air.</p><p>But ſcarce had the late alarm ceaſed, when the fire broke out anew with freſh rage, but in places more wide and ſpacious ; whence fewer perſons were deſtroyed, but more temples and public porticoes were overthrown. As this ſecond conflagration broke out incertain buildings belonging to Tigellinus, they were both generally aſcribed to Nero ; and it was conjectured, that, by deſtroying the old city, he aimed at the glory of building a new one, and calling it by his name. Of the fourteen quarters into which Rome was divided, four remained entire, three were laid in aſhes, and, in the ſeven others, there remained here and there a few houſes, miſerably ſhattered, and half conſumed. Among the many ancient and ſtately edifices, which the rage of the flames utterly conſumed, Tacitus reckons the temple dedicated by Servius Tullius to the Moon ; the temple and great altar conſecrated by Evander to Hercules ; the chapel vowed by Romulus to Jupiter Stator ; the court of Numa, with the temple of Veſta, and in it the tutelar gods peculiar to the Romans. In the ſame fate were involved the ineſtimable treaſures acquired by ſo many victories, the wonderful works of the beſt painters and ſculptors of Greece, and, what is ſtill more to be lamented, the ancient writings of celebrated authors, till then preſerved perfectly entire. It was obſerved, that the fire began the ſame day on which the Gauls, having formerly taken the city, burnt it to the ground.</p><p>Upon the ruins of the demoliſhed city, Nero founded a palace, which he called his <hi rend="italic">golden houſe ;</hi>  though it was not ſo much admired on account of an immenſe profuſion of gold, precious ſtones, and other ineſtimable ornaments, as for its vaſt extent, containing ſpacious fields, -large wilderneſſes, artificial lakes, thick woods, orchards, vineyards, hills, groves, &amp;c. The entrance of this ſtately edifice was wide enough to receive a coloſſus, repreſenting Nero, 120 feet high : the galleries, which conſiſted of three rows of tall pillars, were each a full mile in length ; the lakes were encom∙ paſſed with magnificent buildings, in the manner of cities ; and the woods flocked with ail manner of wild beaſts. The houſe itſelf was tiled with gold : the walls were covered with the ſame metal, and richly adorned with precious ſtones and mother-of-pearl, which in thoſe days was valued above gold : the timber-work and ceilings of the rooms were inlaid with gold and ivory : the roof of one of the banqueting-rooms reſembled the firmament both in its figure and motion, turning inceſſantly about night and day, and ſhowering all ſorts of ſweet waters. When this magnificent ſtructure was finiſhed, Nero approved of it only ſo far as to ſay, that <hi rend="italic">at length he began to lodge like a man.</hi>  Pliny tells us, that this palace extended quite round the city. Nero, it ſeems, did not finiſh it ; for the firſt order Otho ſigned was, as we read in Suetonius, for fifty millions of ſeſterces to be employed in perfecting the golden palace which Nero had begun.</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
