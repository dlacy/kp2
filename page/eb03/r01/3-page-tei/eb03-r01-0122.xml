The wood of the tree is brittle, and of little uſe but for firewood, from the large quantity of refinous gum it contains. The tree is diſtinguiſhed by having pedunculated flowers, and an acute or pointed conical calyptra. To obtain the juice from this tree incitions are made in the trunk of it, and ſometimes upwards oſ 60 gallons of red refinous juice have been obtained from one of them. " when this juice is dried, it becomes a very powerful aſtringent gum-refin, of a red colour, much reſerabling that known in the ſhops by the name of <hi rend="italic">kino,</hi>  and, for all medical purpoſes, fully as efficacious. Mr white ad-miniſtered it to a great number of patients in the dy-ſentery, which prevailed much ſoon after the landing ©f the convicts, and in no one inſtance found it to fail. This gum-refin diffolves almoſt entirely in ſpirit of wine, to which it gives a blood-red tincture, water diſtblves about one fixth part only, and the watery folu-tion is cf a bright red. Both theſe ſolutions are powerfully aſtringent.”</p><p><hi rend="italic">Fellow Gum </hi><hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">Resin,</hi></hi>  is procured from the yellow re-ſin tree, which is as large as the Engliſh walnut tree. The properties of this r.efin are equal to thoſe of the</p><lb/><p>moſt fragrant balſams. It exudes from the bark ſperi-taneouſly, but more readily if incitions are made. The colour of it is yellow, and at firſt it is ſtuid ; but after being inſpiffated in the ſun, it becomes ſolid. When burnt on hot coals, it ſmells like a mixture of balſam of Tolu and benzoin, approaching ſomewhat to ſtorax.</p><p>" It is perfectly ſoluble in ſpirit of wine, but not in water, nor even in effential oil of turpentine, unlels it be digeſted in a ſtrong heat. The varniſh which it makes with either is very weak, and of little uſe. with re-fpect to its medicinal qualities, Mr white has found, it, in many caſes, a good pectoral medicine, and very balfamιc. It is not obtainable in io great abundance as the red gum produced by the eucalyptus refinifera. The plant which produces the yellow gum ſeems to be perfectly unknown to botaniſts, but Mr white has communicated no ſpecimens by which its genus or even claſs could be determined.”</p><p>RESINOUS electricity, is that kind of electricity which is produced by exciting bodies of the re-iinous kind, and which is generally negative.

It is here that we muſt look for a theory of naval architecture,, for the impulſe of the air is our moving power, and this muſt be modified ſo as to produce every motion we want by the form and diſpofition of our fails ; and it is the refiſtance of the water which muſt be overcome, that the ſhip may proceed in her courſe ; and this muſt alſo be modified to our purpoſe, that the ſhip may not drive like a log to leeward, but on ∣he contrary may ply to windward, that ſhe may anſwer her helm briſkly, and that ſhe may be eaſy in all her motions on the ſurface of the troubled ocean. The im-pulſe of wind and water makes them ready and inde-fatigable ſervants in a thouſand ſhapes for driving our machines ; and we ſhould lofe much of their ſervice did we remain ignorant of the laws of their action : they would ſometimes become terrible maſters, if we did not fall upon methods of eluding or ſoftening their attacks.</p><p>we cannot refuſe the ancients a confiderable knowledge of this ſnbject.

It was not, perhaps, poffeffed by them in a ſtrict and ſyftematic form, as it is now taught by our mathema-ticians; but the maſter-builders, in their dockyards, did undoubtedly exerciſe their genius in comparing the forms of their ſtneſt ſhips, and in. marking thoſe circumſtances of form and dimenſton which were <hi rend="italic">in fa£t </hi>accompanied with the deſirable properties of a ſhip, and thus framing to themſelves maxims of naval architecture in the fame xnanncr as we do now.
