<p><label>RUYSCH</label>
(Frederic), one oi the moſt eminent ana-tomiſts of which Holland can boaſt, was born at the Hague in 1638. After making great progreſs at home, he repaired to Leyden, and there proſecuted the ſtudy of anatomy and botany. He ſtudied next at Francker, where he obtained the degree of doctor oſ phyſic. He then returned to the Hague ; and marrying in 1661, dedicated his whole time to the ſtudy of his proſeſſion. In 1665 he publiſhed a treatiſe, entitled <hi rend="italic">Dilucidatio valvularum de variis lymphalicis et lafleis ;</hi> which raiſed his reputation ſo high, that he was choſen proſeſſor of anatomy at Amſterdam. This honour he accepted with the more pleaſure, becauſe his ſituation at Amſterdam would give him eaſy acceſs tt&gt; every requifite help for cultivating anatomy and natural hiſtory. After he ſettled in Amſterdam he was perpetually engaged in diſſecting and in examining with the moſt inquiſitive eye the various parts of the human body, tie improved the ſcience of anatomy by new diſcoveries ; in particular, he found out a way to preſerve dead bodies many years from putrefaction. His anatomical collection was curious and valuable. He had a ſeries of ſeetuſes of all ſizes, from the length of the little finger to that of a new born infant. He had alſo bodies of full grown perſons of all,ages, änd a vaſt number of animals almoſt oſ every ſpecies on the globe, befides a great many other natural cu-rioſities. Peter the Great of Ruſſia, in his tour through Holland in the year 1698, viſited Ruyſch, and was ſo chai med with his conversation, that he</p>

<p>paffed whole days wiſh him ; and when the hour of departure came, he left him with regret. He ſet ſo high a value on Ruyſeh’s cabinet of curioſities, that when he returned to Holland in 1717, he purchaſed it for 30,000 florins, and ſent it to Peterſhurgh.</p><p>In 1685 he was made profeffor of medicine, an office which he diſcharged wiſh great ability. In 1728 he got his tlu'gh-bone broken by a fall <hi rend="italic">in</hi> his chamber. The year before this misfortune happened he had been deprived of his ſon Henry, a youth of talents, and well ſkiiled in anatomy and botany. He had been created a doctor of phyſic, and was ſuppoſed to have aſſiſted bis father in his diſcoveries and publications. Ruyſeh’s family now confiſted only of his youngeſt daughter. This lady had been early inſpired wiſh a paſſion for anatomy, the favourite ſeience of her father and brother, and had ſtudied it with ſucceſs. She was therefore well qualified to aſſiſt her father in forming a ſecond collection of curioſities in natural hiſtory and anatomy, which he began to make after the emperor of Ruſſia had purchaſed the ſirſt. Ruyſch is ſaid to have been of ſo healthy a conſtitution, that though he lived to the age of 93, yet during that long period he did not labour under the infirmities of diſeaſe above a month. From the time he broke his thigh he was indeed diſabled from walking without a ſupport ; yet he retained his vigour both of mind and body without any ſenſible alteration, till in 1731 his ſtrength at once deſerted him. He died on the 2 2d of February the ſame year. His anatomical works are printed in 4 vols 4t0.</p><p>The ſtyle of his writings is ſimple and conciſe, but ſometimes inaccurate. Inſtruction, and not oſtentation, ſeems to be his only aim. In anatomy he undoubtedly made many diſcoveries ; but from not being ſuſſiciently converſant in the writings of other anatomiſts, he publiſhed as diſcoveries what had been known before. The academy of ſciences at Paris in 1727 elected him a member in place of Sir Iſaac Newton, who was lately deceaſed. He was alſo a member of ſhe Royal Society of London.</p>
