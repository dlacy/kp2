<p><span class="font2">RÉGNIER, HENRI FRANÇOIS JOSEPH DE (1864- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;),</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">French poet, was born at Honfleur (Calvados) on the 28th of December 1864, and was educated in Paris for the law. In&nbsp;1885 he began to contribute to the Parisian reviews, and his&nbsp;verses found their way into most of the French and Belgian&nbsp;periodicals favourable to the symbolist writers. Having begun,&nbsp;however, to write under the leadership of the Parnassians, he&nbsp;retained the classical tradition, though he adopted some of&nbsp;the innovations of Moréas and Gustave Kahn. His gorgeous&nbsp;and vaguely suggestive style shows the influence of Stephane&nbsp;Mallarmé, of whom he was an assiduous disciple. His first&nbsp;volume of poems, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lendemains,</span><span class="font2"> appeared in 1885, and among&nbsp;numerous later volumes are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Poèmes anciens et romanesques&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1890), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Les Jetix rustiques et divins</span><span class="font2"> (1890), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Les Médailles d’argent&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(1900), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Cité des eaux</span><span class="font2"> (1903).

<p><span class="font2">RÉGNIER, MATHURIN (1573 -1613), French satirist, was born at Chartres on the 21st of December 1573. His father,&nbsp;Jacques Régnier, was a bourgeois of good means and position;&nbsp;his mother, Simone Desportes, was the sister of the poet Dcs-portes. Desportes, who was richly beneficed and in great&nbsp;favour at court, seems to have been regarded as Mathurin&nbsp;Régnier’s natural protector and patron; and the boy himself,&nbsp;with a view to his following in his uncle’s steps, was tonsured&nbsp;at eight years old. Little is known of his youth, and it is&nbsp;chiefly conjecture which fixes the date of his visit to Italy in&nbsp;a humble position in the suite of the cardinal, François de&nbsp;Joyeuse, in 1587. The cardinal was accredited to the papal&nbsp;court in that year as “ protector ” of the royal interests.&nbsp;Régnier found his duties irksome, and when, after many years&nbsp;of constant travel in the cardinal’s service, he returned definitely&nbsp;to France about 1605, he took advantage of the hospitality of&nbsp;Desportes. He early began the practice of satirical writing,&nbsp;and the enmity which existed between his uncle and the poet&nbsp;Malherbe gave him occasion to attack the latter. In 1606&nbsp;Desportes died, leaving nothing to Régnier, who, though disappointed of the succession to Desportes’s abbacies, obtained a&nbsp;pension of 2000 livres, chargeable upon one of them. He was&nbsp;also made in 1609 canon of Chartres through his friendship&nbsp;with the lax bishop, Philippe Hurault, at whose abbey of&nbsp;Royaumont he spent much time in the later years of his life.&nbsp;But the death of Henry IV. deprived him of his last hope of&nbsp;great preferments. His later life had been one of dissipation,&nbsp;and he died at Rouen at his hotel, the Écu dOrléans, on the&nbsp;22nd of October 1613.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About the time of his death numerous collections of licentious and satirical poems were published, while others remained in&nbsp;manuscript. Gathered from these there has been a floating&nbsp;mass of licentious epigrams, &amp;c., attributed to Régnier, little&nbsp;of which is certainly authentic, so that it is very rare to find&nbsp;two editions of Régnier which exactly agree in contents. His&nbsp;undoubted work falls into three classes: regular satires in&nbsp;alexandrine couplets, serious poems in various metres, and&nbsp;satirical or jocular epigrams and light pieces, which often, if&nbsp;not always, exhibit considerable licence of language. The real&nbsp;greatness of Régnier consists in the vigour and polish of his&nbsp;satires, contrasted and heightened as that vigour is with the&nbsp;exquisite feeling and melancholy music of some of his minor&nbsp;poems. In these Régnier is a disciple of Ronsard (whom he&nbsp;defended brilliantly against Malherbe), without the occasional&nbsp;pedantry, the affectation or the undue fluency of the Pléiade;&nbsp;but in the satires he seems to have had no master except the&nbsp;ancients, for some of them were written before the publication&nbsp;of the satires of Vauquelin* de la Fresnaye, and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tragiques&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of D’Aubigné did not appear until 1616. He has sometimes&nbsp;followed Horace closely, but always in an entirely original&nbsp;spirit. His vocabulary is varied and picturesque, and is not&nbsp;marred by the maladroit classicism of some of the Ronsardists.&nbsp;His verse is extraordinarily forcible and nervous, but his chief&nbsp;distinction as a satirist is the way in which he avoids the&nbsp;commonplaces of satire. His keen and accurate knowledge&nbsp;of human nature and even his purely literary qualities extorted&nbsp;the admiration of Boileau. Régnier displayed remarkable independence and acuteness in literary criticism, and the famous&nbsp;passage (Satire ix., yî </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Monsieur Rapin)</span><span class="font2"> in which he satirizes&nbsp;Malherbe contains the best denunciation of the merely “ correct ”&nbsp;theory of poetry that has ever been written. Lastly, Régnier&nbsp;had a most unusual descriptive faculty, and the vividness&nbsp;of what he called his narrative satires was not approached&nbsp;in France for at least two centuries after his death. All his&nbsp;merits are displayed in the masterpiece entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Macette ou&nbsp;FHypocrisie déconcertée,</span><span class="font2"> which does not suffer even on comparison with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tarlufije;</span><span class="font2"> but hardly any one of the sixteen&nbsp;satires which he has left falls below a very high standard.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lcs Premières Œuvres ou satyres de Régnier</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1608) included the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Discours au roi</span><span class="font1"> and ten satires. There was another in 1609, and&nbsp;others in 1612 and 1613. The author had also contributed to two&nbsp;Collections--Les </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Muses gaillardes</span><span class="font1"> in 1609 and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Le Temple d'Apollon&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in 1611. In 1616 appeared </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les Satyrts et autres œuvres folastres&nbsp;du sieur Régnier,</span><span class="font1"> with many additions.and some poems by other&nbsp;hands. Two famous editions by Elzevir (Leiden, 1642 and 1652)&nbsp;are highly prized. The. chief editions of the 18th centuiy are that&nbsp;of Claude Brossette (printed by Lyon &amp; Woodman, London, 1729),&nbsp;which supplies the standard commentary on Régnier,· and that&nbsp;of Lenglet Dufresnoy (printed by J. Tonson, London, 1733). The&nbsp;editions of Prosper Poitevin (Paris, i860), of Ed. de Barthélemy&nbsp;(Paris, 1862), and of E. Courbet (Paris, 1875),.may be specially&nbsp;mentioned. . The last, printed after the originals in italic type, and&nbsp;well edited, is perhaps the best.

<p><span class="font2">REGNITZ, a river of Germany, and a left-bank tributary of the Main, the most important river of the province of Lower&nbsp;Bavaria. It is formed by the confluence, near Fürth, of the&nbsp;Rednitz and Pegnitz. The united river flows north through&nbsp;an undulating vine-clad country, past Erlangen, Baiersdorf&nbsp;and Forchheim, from which point it is navigable, and falls&nbsp;into the Main at Bischberg, just below Bamberg, after a course&nbsp;of 126 m. Near Bamberg it is joined by the Ludwigskanal,&nbsp;which, running parallel to it from Fürth and separated by the&nbsp;railway, forms the water-connexion between the Main and the&nbsp;Danube. Its main tributaries from the right are the Gründlach&nbsp;and the Wiesent, and from the left the Zenn, the Aurach and&nbsp;the Aisch.</span></p>
