(Publius Papinius), a celebrated Latin poet of the firſt century, was born at Naples, and was the ſon of Statius, a native of Epirus, who went to Rome to teach poetry and eloquence, and had Domitian for his ſcholar. Statius the poet also obtained the favour and friendſhip of that prince ; and dedicated to him his Thebais and Achilleis ; the firſt in twelve books, and the lait in two. He died at Naples about the year 100. Beſides the above poems, there are alſo ſtill extant his <hi rend="italic">Sylva,</hi> in five books ; the ſtyle of which is purer, more agreeable, and more natural, than that of his Thebais and Achilleis.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
