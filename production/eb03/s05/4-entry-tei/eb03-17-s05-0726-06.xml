a genus of animals belonging to the claſs of insectae <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">coleοptera.</hi> The antennæ are moniliform ; the feelers four in number ; the elytra are not above half the length of the abdomen ; the wings are folded up and concealed under the elytra; the tail or extremity of the abdomen is single, is provided with two long vesicles which the insect can ſhoot out or draw back at pleaſure. Gmelin enumerates 117 ſpecies, of which five only are natives of Great Britain ; the murinus, maxilloſus, rufus, riparius, chryſomelinus.</p><p>1. <hi rend="italic">Murinus.</hi> The head is depreſſed. The colour is grey, clouded with black. The length is six lines. It lives among horſe-dung. 2. The <hi rend="italic">maxillοsus</hi> is black, with aſh-coloured ſtripes, and jaws as long as the head. It inhabits the woods. 3. <hi rend="italic">Rufus</hi> is of an orange-colour ; but the poſterior part of the elytra and abdomen is black, as are alſo the thighs at their baſe. 4. <hi rend="italic">Riparius</hi> is of a reddiſh brown colour ; but the elytra are azurecoloured ; and the head, antennæ, and two laſt rings of the abdomen, are black. It is frequent on the banks of rivers in Europe. 5. <hi rend="italic">Chrysomelinus</hi> is black ; the thorax, elytra, and feet being teſtaceous. It is found in the north of Europe.</p><p>The infects have a peculiarity to be met with in almoſt every ſpecies of this genus, which is, that they frequently turn up their tail, or extremity of the abdomen, eſpecially if you chance to touch them ; in which, caſe the tail is ſeen to riſe immediately, as if the infect meant to defend itſelf by stinging. Yet that is not the place where the inſect’s offensive weapons are situated.<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Barbut's Genera Insectorum.</p></note> Its tail has no sting, but in recompenſe it bites and pinches ſtrongly with its jaws ; and care muſt be taken, especially in laying hold of the larger ſpecies. Their jaws are ſtrong, ſhoot out beyond the head, and are subſervient to the animal in ſeizing and deſtroying<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0733.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0727"/>
its prey. It feeds on all other insects it can catch : even frequently two ſtaphylini of the ſame ſpecies bite and tear each other. Though this insect has very ſmall elytra, yet its wings are large ; but they are curiouſly folded up, and concealed under the elytra. The insect unfolds and expands them when he chooſes to fly, which he does very lightly. Among the ſmall ſpecies of this genus, there are several whoſe colours are lively and singularly intermingled.</p><p>Some of them are found upon flowers, but they chiefly inhabit the dung of cows. Their larvae, which reſemble them ſo much as to be ſcarce diſtinguiſhable, live in damp places under ground. They are by ſome called <hi rend="italic">Rove beetles.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
