<p><span class="font1">with a large circle of the chief artists of Florence, and probably learned from him much that was afterwards useful in his practice&nbsp;as an architect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The transition in Raphael’s style from his first or Perugian to his second or Florentine manner is well shown in the large&nbsp;picture of the Coronation of the Virgin painted for Maddalena&nbsp;degli Oddi, now in the Vatican, one of the most beautiful that&nbsp;he ever produced, and especially remarkable for its strong&nbsp;religious sentiment—in this respect a great contrast to the&nbsp;paintings of his last or Roman manner which hang near it. The&nbsp;exquisite grace of the angel musicians and the beauty of the&nbsp;faces show signs of his short visit to Florence, while the general&nbsp;formality of the composition and certain details, such as the&nbsp;fluttering ribands of the angels, recall peculiarities of Perugino&nbsp;and of Pinturicchio, with whose fine picture of the same subject&nbsp;hung close by it is interesting to compare it. Raphael’s painting, though by far the more beautiful of the two, is yet inferior&nbsp;to that of Pinturicchio in the composition of the whole; an&nbsp;awkward horizontal line&nbsp;divides the upper group&nbsp;of the Coronation from&nbsp;that below, the apostles&nbsp;standing round the Vir-gin’s tomb, filled with&nbsp;roses and lilies (Dante,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Par.</span><span class="font1"> xxiii. 73), while the&nbsp;older Perugian has skilfully united the two groups&nbsp;by a less formal arrangement of the figures. The&nbsp;predella of this masterpiece of Raphael is also&nbsp;in the Vatican; some&nbsp;of its small paintings,&nbsp;especially that of the&nbsp;Annunciation to the Virgin, are interesting as&nbsp;showing his careful study&nbsp;of the rules of perspective.@@<sup>1</sup> Several preparatory sketches for this picture exist: fig. 1 shows a study,&nbsp;now at Lille, for the two principal figures, Christ setting&nbsp;the crown on His mother’s head (see fig. 2). It is drawn&nbsp;from two youths in the ordinary dress of the time; and&nbsp;it is interesting to compare it with his later studies from&nbsp;the nude, many of which are for figures which in the future&nbsp;picture were to be draped. It was at Florence, as Vasari says,&nbsp;that Raphael began serious life studies, not only from nude&nbsp;models but also by making careful anatomical drawings from</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">dissected corpses and from skeletons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His first visit to Florence lasted only a few months; in 1505 he was again in Perugia painting his first fresco, the Trinity&nbsp;and Saints for the Camaldoli monks of San Severo, now a mere&nbsp;wreck from injury and restorations. The date </span><span class="font0">MDV</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">and the&nbsp;signature were added later, probably in 1521. Part of this&nbsp;work was left incomplete by the painter, and the fresco was&nbsp;finished in 1521 (after his death) by his old master Perugino.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>It was probably earlier than this that Raphael visited Siena&nbsp;and assisted Pinturicchio with sketches for his Piccolomini&nbsp;frescoes.@@<sup>3</sup> The Madonna of S. Antonio was also finished in&nbsp;1505, but was probably begun before the Florentine visit.@@<sup>4</sup> A</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">record of his visit to Siena exists in a sketch of the antique marble group of the Three Graces, then in the cathedral library,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">from which, not long afterwards, he painted the small panel of the same subject now in Lord Dudley’s collection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1506 Raphael was again in Urbino, where he painted for the duke another picture of St George, which was sent to England&nbsp;as a present to Henry VII. The bearer of this and other gifts&nbsp;was Guidobaldo’s ambassador, the accomplished Baldassare&nbsp;Castiglione (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font1">), a friend of Raphael, whose noble portrait&nbsp;of him is in the Louvre. At the court of Duke Guidobaldo&nbsp;the painter’s ideas appear to have been led into a more secular&nbsp;direction, and to this stay in Urbino probably belong the Dudley&nbsp;Graces, the miniature “ Knight’s Dream of Duty and Pleasure ’’&nbsp;in the National Gallery (London),@@5 and also the “ Apollo and&nbsp;Marsyas,” sold in 1882 by Morris Moore to the Louvre for&nbsp;£10,000, a most lovely little panel, painted with almost Flemish&nbsp;minuteness, rich in colour, and graceful in arrangement.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Towards the end of 1506 Raphael returned to Florence, and there (before 1508) produced a large number of his finest works,&nbsp;carefully finished, and for the most part wholly the work of his&nbsp;own hand. Several of these are signed and dated, but the date&nbsp;is frequently very doubtful, owing to his custom of using Roman&nbsp;numerals, introduced among the sham Arabic embroidered on&nbsp;the borders of dresses, so that the I.’s after the V. are not always&nbsp;distinguishable from the straight lines of the ornament. The&nbsp;following is a list of some of his chief paintings of this period:&nbsp;the “ Madonna del Gran Duca ’’ (Pitti) ; “ Madonna del Giardino,”&nbsp;1506 (Vienna); “Holy Family with the Lamb,” 1506 or 1507&nbsp;(Madrid); the “ Ansidei Madonna,” 1506 or 1507 (National&nbsp;Gallery); the Borghese “Entombment,” 1507; Lord Cowper’s&nbsp;“Madonna” at Panshanger, 1508; “La bella Giardiniera,”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> While at Florence he is said to have taught the science of perspective to his friend Fra Bartolommeo, who certainly gave his young instructor valuable lessons on composition in return.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> The fresco of the Last Supper, dated 1505, in the refectory of S. Onofrio at Florence, is not now claimed as a work of Raphael’s,&nbsp;in spite of a signature partly introduced by the restorer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2</sup> Raphael probably had no hand in the actual execution of the paintings; see Schmarsow, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Raphael und Pinturicchio in Siena&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(Stuttgart, 1880), and Milanesi, in his edition of Vasari, iii. p. 515 seq.,&nbsp;appendix to life of Pinturicchio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@4</sup> This fine altar-piece, with many large figures, is now the property of the heirs of the duke of Ripalta, and is stored in the basement&nbsp;of the National Gallery, London.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@5 </sup>This missal-like painting is about 7 in. square; it was bought in 1847 for 1000 guineas. The National Gallery also possesses its&nbsp;cartoon, in brown ink, pricked for transference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@6</sup> In spite of some adverse opinions, frequently expressed with extreme virulence, the genuineness of this  little gem can hardly be&nbsp;doubted by any one who carefully studies it without bias. Sketches&nbsp;for it at Venice and in the Uffizi also appear to bear the impress of&nbsp;Raphael’s manner. See Delaborde, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Études sur les B. Arts . . . en&nbsp;Italie,</span><span class="font0"> i. p. 236; Gruver, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Raphael et l'antiquité,</span><span class="font0"> ii. p. 421; Eitelberger, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rafael's Apollo und Marsyas</span><span class="font0"> (Vienna, 1860); Batte, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le&nbsp;Raphael de M. Moore</span><span class="font0"> (Paris, 1859); and also various pamphlets&nbsp;on it by its former owner, Mr. Morris Moore.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
