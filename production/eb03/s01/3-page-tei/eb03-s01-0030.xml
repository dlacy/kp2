The biſhop of this country is ſuffragan to the archbiſhop of Compoſtella, and has a yearly revenue of 1000 ducats.

Lat. 37. 32. — It was famous in antiquity for a battle between the Greek and Perſian fleets. In the council of war held among the Perſians on this occaſion, all the commanders were for engaging, becauſe they knew this advice to be moſt agreeable to the king’s inclinations. Queen Artemiſia was the only perſon who oppoſed this reſolution. She was queen of Halicarnaſſus; and followed Xerxes in this war with five ſhips, the beſt equipped of any in the fleet, except thoſe of the Sidonians. This princeſs diſtinguiſhed herſelf on all occaſions by her Angular courage, and ſtill more by her prudence and conduct. She repreſented, in the council of war we are ſpeaking of, the dangerous conſequences of engaging a people that were far more expert in maritime affairs than the Perſians; alleging, that the loſs of a battle at ſea would be attended with the ruin of their army; whereas, by ſpinning out the war, and advancing into the heart of Greece, they would create jealouſies and diviſions among their enemies, who would ſeparate from one another, in order to defend each of them their own country; and that the king might, almoſt without ſtriking a blow, make himſelf maſter of Greece. This advice, though very prudent, was not followed, but an engagement unanimouſly reſolved upon. Xerxes, in order to encourage his men by his preſence, cauſed a throne to be erected on the top of an eminence, whence he might ſafely behold whatever happened; having ſeveral ſcribes about him, to write down the names of fuch as ſhould ſignalize themſelves againſt the enemy. The approach of the Perſian fleet, with the news that a ſtrong detachment from the army was marching againſt Cleombrotus, who defended the iſthmus, ſtruck ſuch a terror into the Pe- loponneſians, that they could not by any intreaties be prevailed upon to ſtay any longer at Salamis. Being therefore determined to put to ſea, and ſail to the iſthmus, Themiſtocles privately diſpatched a truſty friend to the Perſian commanders, informing them of the intended flight; and exhorting them to ſend part of their fleet round the iſland, in order to prevent their eſcape. The fame meſſenger aſſured Xerxes, that Themiſtocles, who had ſent him that advice, deſigned to join the Perſians, as ſoon as the battle began, with all the Athenian ſhips. The king giving credit to all he ſaid, immediately cauſed a ſtrong ſquadron to ſail round the iſland in the night in order to cut off the enemy’s flight. Early next morning, as the Peloponneſians were preparing to ſet ſail, they found themſelves encompaſſed on all ſides by the Perſian fleet; and were againſt their will obliged to remain in the ſtraits of Salamis and expoſe themſelves to the ſame dangers with their allies. The Grecian fleet conſiſted of 380 ſail, that of the Perſians of 2000 and upwards. Themiſtocles avoided the engagement till a certain wind, which roſe regularly every day at the ſame time, and which was entirely contrary to the enemy, began to blow. As ſoon as he found himſelf favoured by this wind, he gave the ſignal for battle. The Perſians, knowing that they fought under their king’s eye, advanced with great reſolution; but the wind blowing directly in their faces, and the largeneſs and</p></body></text></TEI>
