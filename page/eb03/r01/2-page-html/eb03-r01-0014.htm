<p><span class="font0">certain butterflies diſcharged from </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">them as </span><span class="font0">they were high up in the air. But it ſeems a very wild conjec-ture, as we know of no butterfly whoſe excrements or&nbsp;eggs are of ſuch a colour, or whoſe abode is ſo high,&nbsp;or their flocks ſo numerous, as to be the occaſion of&nbsp;this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is moſt probable that theſe bloody waters were never ſeen falling ; but that people feeing the ſtanding&nbsp;■waters b∙lood∙ coloured, were affured, from their not&nbsp;knowing how it ſhould elfe happen, that it had rained&nbsp;blood into them. A very memorable inſtance of this&nbsp;there was at the Hague in the year 1670. Swammerdam, who relates it, tells us, that one morning the&nbsp;whole town was in an uproar on finding their lakes and&nbsp;ditches full of blood, as they thought ; and having been&nbsp;certainly full of water the night before, they agreed it&nbsp;muſt have rained blood in the night : but a certain phy-ſician went down to one of the canals, and taking home&nbsp;a quantity of this blood-coloured water, he examined it&nbsp;by the microfcope, and found that the water was water&nbsp;ſtill, and had not at all changed its colour ; but that it&nbsp;was full of prodigious ſwarms of ſmall red animals, all&nbsp;alive, and very nimble in their motions, whoſe colour&nbsp;and prodigious number gave a red tinge to the whole&nbsp;body of the water they lived in, on a leſs accurate in-ſpection. The certainty that this was the caſe, did not&nbsp;however perſuade the Hollanders to part with the mi-racle : they prudently concluded, that the ſudden ap-pearancε of ſuch a number of animals was as great a&nbsp;prodigy as the raining of blood would have been ; and&nbsp;are aſſured to this day, that this portent foretold the&nbsp;ſcene of war and deſtruction which Louis XIV. afterwards brought into that country, which had before enjoyed 40 years uninterrupted peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The animals which thus colour the water of lakes and ponds are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pulices arboreſcentes</span><span class="font0"> of Swammerdam, or&nbsp;the water-fleas with branched horns. Thefe creatures&nbsp;are of a reddiſh-yellow cr flame colour : they live about&nbsp;the ſides of ditches, under weeds, and among the mud. ;&nbsp;and are therefore the leſs viſible, except at a certain&nbsp;time, which is in the end or beginning of June : it is at&nbsp;this time that theſe little animals leave their receſſes to&nbsp;float looſe about the water, to meet for the propagation&nbsp;of their ſpecies, and by that means become viſible in&nbsp;the colour they give the water. This is viſible, more&nbsp;or leſs, in one part or other of almoſt all ſtanding waters at this feafon ; and it is always at this ſeaſon that&nbsp;the bloody waters have alarmed the ignorant. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pυ-IEX Moηocιιlus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The raining of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">frogs</span><span class="font0"> is a thing not leſs wonderful in the accounts of authors who love the marvellous, than&nbsp;thoſe of blood or ſtones ; and this is ſuppofed to hap-pen ſo often, that there are multitudes who pretend to&nbsp;have been eye-witneſſes of it. Theſe rains of frogs always happen after very dry ſeaſons, and are much more&nbsp;frequent in the hotter countries than in the cold ones.&nbsp;In Italy they are very frequent ; and it is not uncommon&nbsp;to ſee the ſtreets of Rome ſwaiming both with young&nbsp;frogs and toads in an inſtant in a ſhower of rain ; they&nbsp;hopping everywhere between the people’s legs as they&nbsp;walk, though there was not the leaſt appearance of&nbsp;them before. Nay, they have been feen to fall through&nbsp;the air down upon the pavements. This ſeems a ſtrong&nbsp;circumſtance in favour of their being raincd down from&nbsp;the clouds ; but, when ſtrictly examined, it comes to&nbsp;nothing : for theſe frogs that are ſeen to fall, are always&nbsp;found dead, lamed, or bruiſed by the fall, and never hop&nbsp;about as the reſt; and they are never ſeen to fall, except&nbsp;cloſe under the walls of houſes, from the roofs and gutter&nbsp;of which they have accidentally flipped down. Some&nbsp;people, who love to add to ſtrange things yet ſtranger,&nbsp;affirm that they have had the young frogs fall into their&nbsp;hats in the midſt of an open field ; but this is idle, and&nbsp;wholly falſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">others, who cannot agree to their falling from the clouds, have tried to ſolve the difficulty of their ſud-den appearance, by ſuppoſing them hatched out of the&nbsp;egg, or ſpawn, by theſe rains. Nay, fome have ſuppo-ſed them made immediatelyout of the duſt : but there&nbsp;are unanſwerable arguments againſt all theſe ſuppoſitions. Equivocal generation, or the fpontaneous production of animals out of duſt, is now wholly exploded.&nbsp;The fall from the clouds muſt deſtroy and kill thefe&nbsp;tender and ſoft-bodied animals : and they cannot be at&nbsp;this time hatched immediately out of eggs ; becauſe the&nbsp;young frog does not make its appearance from the egg&nbsp;in form, but has its hinder legs enveloped in a fl&lt;in, and&nbsp;is what we call a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tadpole ;</span><span class="font0"> and the young frogs are at&nbsp;leaſt 100 times larger at the time of their appearance,&nbsp;than the egg from which they ſhould be hatched.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is beyond a doubt, that the frogs which make their appearance at this time, were hatched and in being long&nbsp;before : but that the dry feaſons had injured them, and&nbsp;kept them ſluggiſhly in holes or coverts ; and that all the&nbsp;rain does, is the enlivening them, giving them new ſpirits,&nbsp;and calling them forth to ſeek new habitations, and enjoy the element they were deſtined in great part to live&nbsp;in. Theophraſtus, the greateſt of all the naturaliſts of&nbsp;antiquity, has affirmed the fame thing, we find that&nbsp;the error of ſuppoſing theſe creatures to fall from the&nbsp;clouds was as early as that author’s time ; and alſo that&nbsp;the truth, in regard to their appearance, was as early&nbsp;known ; though, in the ages ſince, authors have taken&nbsp;care to conceal the truth, and to hand down to us the&nbsp;error, we find this venerable ſage, in a fragment of&nbsp;his on the generation of animals which appear on a ſudden, bantering the opinion, and aſſerting that they were&nbsp;hatched and living long before. The world owes, however, to the accurate Signior Redi the great proof of&nbsp;this truth, which Theophraſtus only has affirmed : for&nbsp;this gentleman, diſſecting ſome of thefe new-appearing&nbsp;frogs, found in their ſtomachs herbs and other half-di-geſted food ; and, openly ſhowing this to his credulous&nbsp;countrymen, aſked them whether they thought that na-ture, which engendered, according to their opinion,&nbsp;theſe animals in the clouds, had alfo been ſo provident&nbsp;as to engendcr grais there for their food and nouriſh-rnent ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the raining of frogs we ought to add the raining of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">grajshοpι ers</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">locυjis,</span><span class="font0"> which have ſometimes appeared in prodigious numbers, and devoured the fruits&nbsp;of the earth. There has not been the leaſt pretence for&nbsp;the luppoſing that theie animals defcended from the&nbsp;clouds, but that they appeared on a fudden in prodigious numbers. The naturaliſt, who knows the many ac-ciden∙ts attending the eggs of theie and other the like&nbsp;animals, cannot but know that ſome ſeafons will prove&nbsp;particularly favourable to the hatching them, and the&nbsp;prodigious number of eggs that many infects lay could&nbsp;not but every year bring us ſuch abundance of the young,&nbsp;were they not liable to many accidents, and had not provident nature taken care, as in many plants, to continue</span></p>
