<p><span class="font0">any Roman citizen from holding more than five hundred acres of national lands ; and also fixing the rent of public&nbsp;lands at the tenth of grain, and the fifth of tlle vintage&nbsp;and other fruit-produce. Another law ordained that one of&nbsp;the consuls should be chosen from the body of the commons.&nbsp;The third provided, that in cases of outstanding debts, all the&nbsp;interest which had been paid should be deducted from the&nbsp;capital, and that the remainder should be paid by equal instalments in three years. For the public influence thus&nbsp;obtained by the commons, the patricians endeavoured to&nbsp;compensate by the appointment of a prætor from their own&nbsp;body, and of curule ædiles ; but the plebeians having obtained so much, could not any longer be prevented from attaining a perfect equality in point of eligibility to all public&nbsp;offices. In a short time afterwards, their participation in&nbsp;the other magisterial offices followed as a matter of course;&nbsp;the dictatorship, b. c. 353, the censorship, 348, the præ-torship, 334, and even the priesthood, 300.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus at last the object of political equality between the patricians and plebeians was attained ; and though the difference between patrician and plebeian families still subsisted, they gradually ceased to form political parties distinguished by origin and descent, yet there still remained the&nbsp;elements of strife between the wealthy and the poor, in which&nbsp;character all subsequent civil contentions at Rome ought to&nbsp;be considered. This we here deem it expedient to state&nbsp;distinctly, in order to guard the reader from the error of&nbsp;viewing the popular contests in which the Roman people&nbsp;were frequently engaged, after the passing of the Licinian&nbsp;laws, as merely a revival of the old feuds between the privileged patrician populus, or exclusive citizen-nobility of&nbsp;Rome, and the unprivileged, yet personally free commons,&nbsp;the growth of conquest, and forming the real strength of&nbsp;Rome. The early feuds were caused by the endeavours of&nbsp;the patrician populus to engross and retain all political power&nbsp;and privilege, and of the plebeian commons to secure personal liberty, and acquire civic and political equality. This&nbsp;was accomplished directly by, or soon in consequence of,&nbsp;the Licinian laws. But no public law can produce equality&nbsp;of wealth and influence : oppression may be prevented, sufferings may be mitigated, the growth of exorbitant wealth&nbsp;and power may be checked by wise enactments ; but moral&nbsp;laws alone can prevent those inequalities of wealth and influence which must always exist, from becoming injurious, and finally destructive to any state, whatever be the&nbsp;excellence of its civil and political code.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Immediately after the conclusion of these civic struggles, the Romans were again engaged in hostilities against the&nbsp;Gauls and the Etrurians. Over both they were victorious;&nbsp;and in one of the battles with the Gauls, Titus Manlius,&nbsp;son ofthe consul, distinguished himself by slaying, in single&nbsp;combat, a Gaul of huge stature, despoiling him, in sight of&nbsp;both armies, of a gold chain, which the barbarian wore as&nbsp;an ornament, and throwing the bloody trophy around his&nbsp;own neck. For this exploit he received the name of Torquatus. Another Roman champion, Marcus Valerius, in&nbsp;another battle also slew' a huge Gaul in single combat ; in&nbsp;which, as tradition relates, he was assisted by a crow, and&nbsp;thence was named Corvus, or Corvinus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But while Rome was extending her dominions, and raising her military reputation in these conflicts, she was maturing her strength for struggles more formidable than any in which she had previously engaged. The Samnites, a&nbsp;people of Sabellian race, inhabiting chiefly a mountainous&nbsp;country·, and celebrated for their courage and hardihood,&nbsp;made war upon the Sidicinians. They applied to the Campanians for aid against the Samnites; but both united proving too feeble, the Campanians applied to Rome ; and the&nbsp;people of Capua declared themselves subject to Rome, that&nbsp;they might secure its protection. The Samnites refused to&nbsp;submit to the dictation of R ome, and prosecuted their hostilities against the Campanians. This produced a war between tlle Romans and the Samnites, by which the utmost&nbsp;strength of Rome was sternly tried. Several battles were&nbsp;fought, without producing any decisive results, though in&nbsp;general victory inclined to the Romans. On one occasion,&nbsp;the Roman army was in the utmost danger of being drawn&nbsp;into a disadvantageous situation in a narrow pass, and there&nbsp;surrounded, when it was rescued by the skill and courage&nbsp;of Decius, a military tribune, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font0"> victory was gained over&nbsp;the Samnites. At length a truce was concluded for a period,&nbsp;both nations having suffered considerable losses</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the truce, the Latins continued to harass the Samnites ; and when tile Romans prohibited them, they declared war against Rome herself. This led to an unnatural&nbsp;war between nations that had for some time been almost&nbsp;completely blended. Manlius and Decius were sent against&nbsp;the Latins, and, in order to prevent the confusion that might&nbsp;arise between nations similar in language, arms, and discipline, the consul Manlius prohibited any Roman soldier from&nbsp;leaving the ranks on pain of death. But a daring Latin&nbsp;chief having challenged any Roman to single combat, the&nbsp;consul’s own son could not brook that the haughty defiance&nbsp;should remain unanswered, quitted the ranks, slew his antagonist, and returning, laid the spoils at the feet ofhis father.&nbsp;The stern consul, though he had obtained his own name,&nbsp;Torquatus, from a similar gallant deed, immediately commanded the youthful champion to be beheaded on the spot,&nbsp;for breach of orders ; disregarding the cries and entreaties&nbsp;of the soldiers, when they saw their young hero bound,&nbsp;and in a few seconds extended a headless trunk before&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A desperate engagement almost instantly took place, both armies striving at once for victory and for empire. The&nbsp;wing commanded by the consul Decius being on the point&nbsp;of giving way, he threw aside his armour, assumed a flowing&nbsp;robe of white, devoted himself with due rites to the infernal&nbsp;deities, for the safety of Rome, then mounting his horse&nbsp;plunged into the heart of the conflict, while his white&nbsp;robe streamed loose around his unarmed body. He soon&nbsp;fell, pierced by innumerable wounds; but the Romans believed that such a sacrifice necessarily secured the victory, while&nbsp;the Latins regarded it as equally ominous to them of defeat.&nbsp;The event was not long doubtful. The Romans were victorious in every quarter, and tlle Latins sustained a complete&nbsp;defeat. This battle is remarkable as being that in which&nbsp;the peculiar tactics of the Roman legion are first described by Livy ; but whether the arrangement was tlle invention of Manlius, is not stated. The author of such a decided&nbsp;improvement in the art of war ought to have been made&nbsp;known ; as there can be no doubt tllat the peculiar qualities&nbsp;of the Roman legion were greatly instrumental in achieving&nbsp;the empire of the world.

<p><span class="font0">The Romans prosecuted their success with such vigour, that in the three ensuing campaigns Latium and Campania were subdued, and annexed as provinces to the territories of the republic. But the conclusion of one war was&nbsp;to Rome the beginning of another. The Samnites again&nbsp;took up arms, and were joined by theEucanians. To resist&nbsp;his dangerous confederacy, the Romans mustered all their&nbsp;power, and placed Papirius Cursor at their head as dictator.&nbsp;Papirius reduced the enemy so much that they were glad&nbsp;to sue for a truce. But this was of no long continuance ;&nbsp;and the Samnite general, Pontius, succeeded in drawing the&nbsp;Roman army into such a position that it could neither fight&nbsp;nor flee, being completely surrounded in a narrow defile&nbsp;called the Caudine Forks. The Roman soldiers were compelled to surrender at discretion, and were disarmed, obliged to pass under the yoke, and then dismissed with disgrace.&nbsp;This dishonour served only to rouse the indignation and the&nbsp;pride of Rome. Papirius was again chosen dictator, and&nbsp;again led the Romans to victory and revenge. The hum</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
