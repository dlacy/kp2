<p><label>ROUGET DE LISLE, CLAUDE JOSEPH</label>
(1760-1836), French author, was born on the 10th of May 1760, at Lons-le-Saunier (Jura). He entered the army as an engineer, and attained the rank of captain. He was one of those authors whom a single work has made famous. The song which has immortalized him, the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise,</hi> was composed at Strassburg, where Rouget de Lisle was quartered in April 1792. He wrote both words and music in a fit of patriotic excitement after a</p><p>public dinner. The piece was at first called <hi rend="italic">Ckanl de guerre de Varmée du Rhin,</hi> and only received its name of <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> from its adoption by the Provençal volunteers whom Barbaroux introduced into Paris, and who were prominent in the storming of the Tuileries. The author was a moderate republican, and was cashiered and thrown into prison; but the counter-revolution set him at liberty. He died at Choisy-le-Roi (Seine et Oise) on the 26th of June 1836. The stirring melody of the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise</hi> and its ingenious adaptation to the words serve to disguise the alternate poverty and bombast of the words themselves. Rouget de Lisle wrote a few other songs of the same kind, and in 1825 he published <hi rend="italic">Chants français,</hi> in which he set to music fifty songs by various authors. His <hi rend="italic">Essais en vers et en prose</hi> (1797) contains the <hi rend="italic">Marseillaise,</hi> a prose tale of the sentimental kind called <hi rend="italic">Adelaide et Monville,</hi> and some occasional poems.</p>
