<p><span class="font0">army being diſtreſſed for want of proviſions, he ſent out parties to pillage the fields, and raiſe contributions&nbsp;in the neighbouring cities. One of theſe parties appeared before Ardea, where the great Camillus had&nbsp;now ſpent two years in a private liſe. Notwithſtanding the affront he had received at Rome, the love he&nbsp;bore his country was not in the leaſt diminiſhed. The&nbsp;ſenate of Ardea being met to deliberate on the meaſures to be taken with relation to the Gauls, Camillus,&nbsp;more afflicted at the calamities of his country than at&nbsp;his own baniſhment, deſired to be admitted into the&nbsp;council, where, with his eloquence, he prevailed upon&nbsp;the Ardeates to arm their youth in their own defence,&nbsp;and refuſe the Gauls admittance into their city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hereupon the Gauls encamped before the city ; and as they deſpiſed the Ardeates alter they had made&nbsp;themſelves maſters of Rome, they preſerved neither order nor diſcipline in the camp, but ſpent whole days in&nbsp;drinking. Hereupon Camillus, having eaſily perſuaded&nbsp;the youth of the city to follow him, marched out of&nbsp;Aιdeaina very dark night, ſurpriſed the Gauls drowned in wine, and made a dreadful ∩aughter of them.&nbsp;Thoſe who made their eſcape under the ſhelter of the&nbsp;night fell next day into the hands of the peaſants, by&nbsp;whom they were maſſacred without mercy. This defeat of the enemy revived the courage of the Romans&nbsp;ſcattered about the country, eſpecially of thoſe who&nbsp;had retired to Veii after the unfortunate battle of Allia. There was not one of them who did not condemn&nbsp;himſelf for the exile of Camillus, as if he had been the&nbsp;author of it ; and looking upon that great man as their&nbsp;laſt reſource, they reſolved to chooſe him for their leader. Accordingly, they ſent without delay ambaſſadors&nbsp;to him, beſetching him to take into his protection the&nbsp;fugitive Romans, and the wrecks of the defeat at Allia.&nbsp;But Camillus would not accept of the command of the&nbsp;troops till the people aſſembled by curiæ had legally&nbsp;conferred it upon him. He thought the public authority was lodged in the hands of thoſe who were ſhut up&nbsp;iu the citadel, and therefore would undertake nothing&nbsp;at the head of the Roman troops till a commiſſion. was&nbsp;brought him from thence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To do this was very difficult, the place being inveſted on all ſides by the enemy. However, one Pontius Co-minius, a man of mean birth, but bold, and very ambitious of glory, undertook it. He put on a light habit,&nbsp;and, providing himſelf with cork, to keep the longer&nbsp;above water, threw himſelf into the Tiber above Rome&nbsp;in the beginning of the night, and ſuffered himſelf to&nbsp;be carried down with the ſtream. At length he came&nbsp;to the foot of the capitol, and landed at a ſteep place&nbsp;where the Gauls had not thought it neceſſary to poſt&nbsp;any centinels. There he mounted with great difficulty&nbsp;to the rampart of the citadel ; and having made himſelf&nbsp;known to the guards, he was admitted into the place,&nbsp;and conducted, to the magiſtrates. The ſenate being&nbsp;immediately aſſembled, Pontius gave them an account&nbsp;of Camillus’s victory ; and in the name of all the Romans at Veii demanded that great captain for their general. There was not much time ſpent in debates: the&nbsp;curiæ being called* together, the act of condemnation&nbsp;which had been paſſed on Camillus was abrogated, and&nbsp;he named dictator with one voice. Pontius was immediately diſpatched with the decree ; and the ſame good&nbsp;fortune which had attended him to the capitol accompanied him in his return. Thus was Camillus, ſrom the&nbsp;ſtate of baniſhment, raiſed at once to be ſovereign magiſtrate of his country. His promotion to the command was no ſooner known, but ſoldiers flocked from&nbsp;all parts to his camp ; inſomuch that he ſoon ſaw himſelf at the head of above 40,000 men, partly Romans&nbsp;and partly allies,.who all thought themſelves invincible&nbsp;under ſo great a general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While he was taking proper meaſures to raiſe the blockade of the citadel, ſome Gauls rambling round the&nbsp;place, perceived on the ſide of the hill the print of Pontius’s hands and ſeet. They obſerved likewiſe, that the&nbsp;moſs on the rocks was in ſeveral places torn up. From&nbsp;theſe marks they concluded, that ſomebody had lately&nbsp;gone up to and returned from the capitol. The Gauls&nbsp;immediately made their report to Brennus of what they&nbsp;had obſerved ; and that experienced commander laid a&nbsp;deſign, which he imparted to nobody, of ſurpriſing the&nbsp;place by the ſame way that the Roman had aſcended.&nbsp;With this view he choſe out of the army ſuch ſoldiers&nbsp;as had dwelt in mountainous countries, and been accuſtomed from their youth to climb precipices. Theſe&nbsp;he ordered, after he had well examined the nature of&nbsp;the place, to aſcend in the night the ſame way that was&nbsp;marked out ſor them ; climbing two abreaſt, that one&nbsp;might ſupport the other in getting up the ſteep parts&nbsp;of the precipice. By this means they advanced with&nbsp;much difficulty from rock to rock, till they arrived at&nbsp;the foot of the wall. They proceeded with ſuch ſilence,&nbsp;that they were not diſcovered or heard, either by the&nbsp;centinels who were upon guard in the citadel, or even&nbsp;by the dogs, that are uſually awaked and alarmed at&nbsp;the leaſt noiſe. But though they eluded the ſagacity&nbsp;of the dogs, they could not eſcape the vigilance of the&nbsp;geeſe. A flock of theſe birds was kept in a court of&nbsp;the capitol in honour of Juno, and near her temple.&nbsp;Notwithſtanding the want of proviſions in the garriſon,&nbsp;they had been ſpared out of religion ; and as theſe&nbsp;creatures are naturally quick of hearing, they were&nbsp;alarmed at the firſt approach of the Gauls ; ſo that&nbsp;running up and down, with their cackling and beating&nbsp;of their wings, they awaked 'Manlius, a gallant ſoldier,&nbsp;who ſome years before had been conſul. He founded&nbsp;an alarm, and was the firſt man who mounted the ram-part, where he found two Gauls already upon the wall.&nbsp;One of theſe offered to diſeharge a blow at him with&nbsp;his battle-ax; but Manlius cut off his right hand at one&nbsp;blow, and gave the other ſuch a puſh with his buckler,&nbsp;that he threw him headlong from the top of the rock&nbsp;to the bottom. He, in his fall, drew many others with&nbsp;him ; and, in the mean time, the Romans crowding to&nbsp;the place, preſſed upon the Gauls, and tumbled them&nbsp;one over another. As the nature of the ground would&nbsp;not ſuffer them to make a regular retreat, or even to fly,&nbsp;moſt of them, to avoid the ſwords of the enemy, threw&nbsp;themſelves down the precipice, ſo that very few &lt;τ<sub>θ</sub>t&nbsp;ſafe back to their camp..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As it was the cuſtom of the Romans at that time not to ſuffer any commendable action to go unrewarded, the tribune Sulpitius aſſembled his troops the next&nbsp;morning, in order to beſtow the military rewards on&nbsp;thoſe who, the night before,, had deſerved them. Among&nbsp;theie Manlius was firſt named; and, in acknowledgment&nbsp;of the important ſervice he had juſt rendered the ſtate&nbsp;every ſoldier gave him part of the coin which he receil</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
