            <p>him at Alexandria were more solemn and extraordinary than thoſe of any other
                place.</p>
            <p>Plutarch and Clemens of Alexandria, as well as Tacitus @@, inform us, that while the
                firſt Ptolemy was employed in fortifying Alexandria with walls, adorning it with
                temples and ſtately buildings, there appeared to him in his ſleep a young man of
                extraordinary beauty, of a ſtature more than human, admoniſhing him to dispatch into
                Pontus ſome of his most truſty friends to bring from thence his ſtatue : he assured
                him, that the pity and kingdom which posseſſed it ſhould prove happy, glorious, and
                powerful. The young man having thus ſpoke, diſappeared, mounting up into heaven in a
                blaze of fire.</p>
            <p>Ptolemy diſcovered his viſion to the priests : but finding them ignorant of Pontus,
                he had recourſe to an Athenian, who informed him that near Sinope, a city of Pontus,
                there was a temple much reſorted to by the natives, which was consecrated to Pluto,
                where he had a ſtatue, near which ſtood that of a woman. Ptolemy, neglecting the
                injunctions of the apparition, it again appended to him in a menacing attitude ; and
                the king immediately diſpatched ambaſſadors to the Serapian monarch, loaded with
                preterits, The king of Sinope consented ; but his ſubjects oppoſed the removal of
                the statue. The god, however, of his own accord, as we are informed, conveyed
                himſelf to the ambassador’s ſhip, and in three days landed in Alexandria, The ſtatue
                of Serapis was erected in one of the ſuburbs of the city, where a magnificent temple
                was afterwards reared.</p>
            <p>The ſtatue of Serapis, according to Macrobius, was of a human form, with a baſket or
                buſhel on his head, signifying plenty ; his right hand leaned on the head of a
                ſerpent, whoſe body was wound round a figure with three heads, of a dog, a lion, and
                a wolf ; in his left hand he held a measure of a cubit length, as it were to take
                the height of the waters of the Nile. The figure of Serapis is found on many ancient
                medals,</p>
            <p>The famous temple of Serapis at Alexandria was destroyed by order of Theodosius ; and
                the celebrated ſtatue of tins deity was broken in pieces, and its limbs carried
                firſt in triumph by the Chriſtians through the city, and then thrown into a fierce
                fire, kindled for that purpose in the amphitheatre. As the Egyptians aſcribed the
                overflowing of the Nile, to which was owing, the fertility of their country, to the
                benign influence of their god Serapis, they concluded, that now he was destroyed,
                the river would no longer overflow, and that a general famine would ensue ; but when
                they obſerved, on the contrary, that the Nile ſwelled to a greater height than had
                been known in the memory of man, and thereby produced an immenſe plenty of all kinds
                of proviſions, many of the pagans renouncing the worſhip of idols, adored the God of
                the Chriſtians.</p>

            <p>SERENADE, a kind of concert given in the night by a lover to his mistreſs, under her
                window, Theſe sometimes only consiſt of inſtrumental music, but at other times
                voices are added ; the muſic and ſongs compoſed for theſe occasions are alſo called
                serenades.</p>
            <p>SERENE, a title of honour given to ſeveral princes and to the principal magiſtrates
                of republics. The king of Britain, the republic and doge of Venice, and the children
                of the king of Spain, are called most serene; and when the pops or the ſacred
                college write to the emperor, to kings, or to the doge, they give them no other
                title. In like manner, the emperor gives no other title to any king, except to the
                king of France.</p>
            <p>SERENUS (Sammonicus), a celebrated physician in the reigns of the emperor Severus and
                Caracalla, in and about the year 200. He wrote ſeveral treatiſes on hiſtory and the
                works of nature ; but there is only one of them extant, which is a very indifferent
                poem on the Remedies of Diſeaſea, He was murdered at a feſtival by the order of
                Caracalla. He had a library that contained 62,000 volumes, which Quintus Serenus
                Sammonicus his ſon gave to Gordian the Younger, to whom he was preceptor.</p>
            <p>SERES (Ptolemy) : a people of the Farther Aſia ; bounded on the west by Scythia extra
                Imaum ; on the north and eaſt, by Terra Incognita ; and on the south, by India extra
                Gangem. According to theſe limits, their country anſwers nearly to Cathoy or North
                China. Other authors vary greatly in placing them, though, the generality agree in
                placing them far to the eaſt. Mela places them between the Indi and Scythæ ; and
                perhaps beyond the Indi, if we diſtinguiſh the Sinas from them. The ancients commend
                them for their cotton manufactures, different from the produce of the bombyces or
                silk-worms, called <hi rend="italic">fires</hi> by the Greeks: whence serica
                "silk.”</p>
            <p>SERGE, a woollen quilted fluff, manufactured on a loom with four treddles, after the
                manner of rateens, and other fluffs that have the whale. The goodneſs of serges is
                known by the quilting, as that of cloths by the ſpinning. Of ſerges there are
                various kinds, denominated either from the different qualities thereof, or from the
                places where they are wrought. The most considerable is the London ſerge, now highly
                valued abroad, particularly in France, where a manufacture is carried on with
                considerable ſucceſs, under the title of <hi rend="italic">ſerge facon de
                    Londres.</hi></p>
            <p>The method of making the London ſerge we ſhall now deſcribe: For wool, the longest is
                choſen for the warp, and the ſhortest for the woof. Before either kind is uſed, it
                is firſt ſcoured, by putting it in a copper of liquor, ſomewhat more than lukewarm,
                compoſed of three parts of fair water and one of urine. . After having flayed long
                enough therein for the liquor to diſſolve, and take off the greaſe, &amp;c. it is
                stirred briskly about with a wooden peel ; taken out of the liquor, drained, and
                waſhed in a running water, dried in the ſhade, beaten with sticks on a wooden rack
                to drive out the coarſer duſt and filth, and then picked clean with the hands. Thus
                far prepared, it is greaſed with oil of olives, and the longeſt part, deſtined for
                the warp, is combed with large combs, heated in a little furnace for the purpoſe. To
                clear off the oil again, the wool is put in a liquor compoſed of hot water, with
                ſoap melted therein: whence being taken out, wrung, and dried, it is ſpun on the
                wheel.</p>
            <p>As to the ſhorter wool, intended for the woof, it is only carded on the knee with
                small cards, and then ſpun on the wheel, without being ſcoured of its oil. It must
                be remarked, that the thread for the warp is always to be ſpun much finer, and
                better twilled than that of the woof. The wool both for the warp and the woof being
                ſpun, and the thread divided into ſkains, that of the woof is put on ſpools (unleſs
