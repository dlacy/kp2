a country of the Russian empire, between Asiatic Tartary and Archangel, lying along the sea-coast as far as Siberia. The inhabitants are extremely rude and barbarous, travelling on the snow in sledges drawn by an animal like a rein-deer, but with the horns of a stag. Their chief employment consists in hunting and fishing.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
