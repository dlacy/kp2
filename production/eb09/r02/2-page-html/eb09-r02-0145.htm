<p><span class="font0">coating of a well-maintained road the proportion of stones of various sizes varies, but generally from one-third to one-half is found to&nbsp;consist of detritus under three-eighths of an inch in diameter, and&nbsp;there is a very constant proportion of about one-fifth of mud and&nbsp;detritus under one-thirtieth of an inch in diameter. This appears&nbsp;to be the amount necessary to fill the voids between the fragments&nbsp;of stone when compacted together. In an ill-kept road, from which&nbsp;the mud is not removed, the proportion of detritus is much higher,&nbsp;and mud may constitute nearly one-half of the coating. In proportion as the detritus and mud are kept down to the minimum by&nbsp;constant removal from the surface, so will the road be able to resist&nbsp;the action of wet and frost and the wear of the traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The wear of materials, resulting in their gradual reduction to detritus, is due to the joint action of the traffic and the weather,&nbsp;which cause surface wear, wear arising from cross breaking, and&nbsp;from rubbing of the stones together. When there is no movement&nbsp;in the body of the road, and the wear is confined to the crushing&nbsp;and grinding at the surface, it is the least possible ; but, when a&nbsp;road is weak from insufficient thickness or solidity on a yielding&nbsp;foundation, bending and cross breaking of the coating take place&nbsp;under passing loads in addition to the surface wear, and the effects&nbsp;are aggravated by the softening action of water finding its way into&nbsp;the road through cracks formed in the surface and by the disintegrating action of frost. The wear and waste are thus far larger than&nbsp;on roads of sufficient strength, properly maintained. The destructive effect of wheels is greater as the diameter is less, and to a much&nbsp;greater degree as the tire is narrower. On hard and strong roads&nbsp;no greater width of wheel than 4⅜ inches is useful, as a wider tire&nbsp;does not bear evenly, but on yielding roads a greater width is of&nbsp;some advantage, though it does not prevent damage from bending&nbsp;and cross breaking of the whole coating under excessive loads.&nbsp;A good deal of attention has been given by French engineers to&nbsp;the measurement of traffic, wear, and the consumption of road&nbsp;materials. Without a knowledge of the amount of traffic accurate&nbsp;comparisons of wear are impossible, and an account of the traffic on&nbsp;the roads of France is taken periodically in “collars” or horses&nbsp;drawing loads, and in the weight drawn. Traffic as measured by&nbsp;weight drawn has of late been observed in some of the streets of&nbsp;London and Liverpool, and has been reduced for comparison to the&nbsp;weight per foot or yard of width of the carriage-way. Wear may&nbsp;be measured by loss of thickness in the coating ; but the loss of&nbsp;stone in proportion to detritus must also be ascertained before all&nbsp;the effects of wear can be determined. The accurate measurement&nbsp;of wear as practised by the French engineers is a complicated process,&nbsp;and it must suffice here to state that measured by thickness the&nbsp;wear is seldom found to exceed half an inch, or on the most frequented roads of France one inch, of consolidated surface per year,&nbsp;and that about 100 cubic yards of good materials per mile per year&nbsp;are considered as the average consumption under 100 collars of traffic&nbsp;per day. Observations in the United Kingdom on roads well and&nbsp;systematically maintained have confirmed these results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The new materials may be added to the road either in thin coats and small patches year by year or in a thick coat consolidated by&nbsp;rolling. The first method, by which the wear is replaced annually&nbsp;and the traffic is depended on to work the materials into the road,&nbsp;can be followed with excellent results, and at no great inconvenience to the public under proper management when the traffic is not&nbsp;excessive. Considerable care in the use of materials is required&nbsp;that none may be unnecessarily applied. The annual employment&nbsp;of one-fifth or one-sixth the quantity which it would take to cover&nbsp;the whole surface one stone in thickness is often sufficient to replace&nbsp;wear, and it will then take five or six years to coat every part of the&nbsp;road if it is covered regularly. It is therefore important to apply&nbsp;the new materials only where they are needed, and not to use them&nbsp;where the road is already sufficiently thick. The irregularity of&nbsp;wear and of thickness enables a good roadman to judge where new&nbsp;materials must be applied, and he will apply them in small quantities wherever weak places appear. To facilitate this the materials&nbsp;should be placed in heaps by the roadside in the summer, and they&nbsp;should be carefully spread in the autumn and attended to afterwards to ensure consolidation without waste. By good management a large quantity of materials may be incorporated in a road&nbsp;before the middle of the winter without harassing the traffic, and&nbsp;the strength may not only be maintained but increased. On a&nbsp;hard strong road consolidation may be aided by loosening the surface with a pick ; generally only the margin of a patch need be&nbsp;picked up. But if the road is soft or weak it is better not to disturb&nbsp;the surface at all. Binding may sometimes be used to aid consolidation, but it is seldom necessary if the materials are properly&nbsp;laid and attended to, as the coating already contains detritus enough.&nbsp;In the second method a coating of materials is laid on at once&nbsp;sufficient to endure the wear of several years with such slight&nbsp;repairs as may be necessary to keep a good surface, and, when the&nbsp;wear has gone as far as it can be safely allowed to go, the process is&nbsp;repeated. Unless the wear is very considerable there is no economy&nbsp;in this method, though the convenience to the public, especially in&nbsp;towns, is undeniable. Consolidation by rolling (after the manner&nbsp;already described) is essential, and it is generally desirable to loosen&nbsp;the old surface to ensure the incorporation of the new coating with&nbsp;it. Scraping and attention are required between one coating and&nbsp;another and also slight repairs to the surface, as, however well the&nbsp;materials may be laid and rolled, the wear of the ordinary traffic&nbsp;will search out places which have escaped the full pressure of the&nbsp;roller and produce inequalities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides a regular application of new materials to replace wear, there must be in road maintenance on proper principles a systematic&nbsp;removal of the detritus by scraping or sweeping, which must be&nbsp;regarded as keeping the whole coating in proper condition, and not&nbsp;as mere surface cleansing. The wear should also be reduced as far&nbsp;as possible by providing sufficient thickness to carry the traffic, by&nbsp;keeping an even surface on which water can never stand and soak,&nbsp;and by good drainage both of surface and subsoil. An adequate&nbsp;amount of skilled manual labour is necessary for economy of maintenance, and this and the constant attention which is required to&nbsp;keep a road in good order are best secured by putting a man in&nbsp;permanent charge of a defined length. In the autumn and winter,&nbsp;when more labour is wanted, extra men should work under the&nbsp;directions of the permanent road labourer, whose knowledge of his&nbsp;length of road will enable him to employ them to the best advantage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Concrete macadam, formed by grouting with lime or cement mortar a coat of broken stone laid over a bed of stone previously&nbsp;well rolled, has been tried as an improvement on an ordinary&nbsp;macadamized surface, but not hitherto with much success. When&nbsp;cleanliness is of importance, and great durability is not required, tar&nbsp;macadam or bituminous concrete may be usefully employed. It&nbsp;is sometimes made by first spreading a coating of broken stone and&nbsp;consolidating it by a roller, and then pouring over it a mixture of&nbsp;coal-tar, pitch, and creasote oil, upon which a layer of smaller&nbsp;stone is spread and rolled in, and the surface finished with stone&nbsp;chippings rolled in. More usually the broken stone and bituminous&nbsp;mixture are well incorporated together before they are spread, the&nbsp;stone sometimes being previously heated. The lower layer, about&nbsp;4 inches thick, may be of stone broken to 2⅜ inches gauge, and the&nbsp;next layer, about 2 inches thick, may be of smaller stone. Each&nbsp;layer must be well rolled, and when perfectly solid a thin coating&nbsp;of fine stone or granite chippings is spread over the surface and&nbsp;rolled in. Hard limestone is found to be more suitable than sili-cious or igneous rocks for this material. A road surface well made&nbsp;in this manner will last several years under light traffic without&nbsp;any repairs, and it can easily be patched when necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Stone Pavements.—Early pitched roadways consisted of pebbles or rounded boulders, bedded in the natural surface or in sand or&nbsp;gravel. The next step in advance was to employ roughly-squared&nbsp;blocks ; but the wide and irregular joints admitted the water to&nbsp;the subsoil, and the mud worked up and the stones sank irregularly under the traffic. Telford, who was called upon to report on&nbsp;the street pavements of the parish of Hanover Square in 1824, saw&nbsp;the necessity of cutting off all connexion between the subsoil and&nbsp;the paving stones. He recommended a bed of about 6 inches of&nbsp;clean river ballast, rendered compact by being travelled upon for&nbsp;some time before the paving was laid, but he subsequently considered that nothing short of 12 inches of broken stone, put on&nbsp;in layers 4 inches thick and completely consolidated by carriages&nbsp;passing over them, would answer the purpose. He recommended&nbsp;paving stones of considerable depth and of from 4⅜ to 6 or 7⅜&nbsp;inches in breadth for the gι<sup>,</sup>eatest thoroughfares, and he pointed&nbsp;out the importance of working the stones flat on the face and square&nbsp;on all sides, so as to joint close and preserve the bed or base as&nbsp;nearly as possible of the same size as the face, and of carefully&nbsp;placing together in the same course stones of equal breadth. Many&nbsp;pavements thus laid with stones of considerable breadth still remain, but experience proved that it was a mistake to suppose that&nbsp;broad stones having a larger base would support better the weight&nbsp;and shocks of heavy traffic ; on the contrary, a wide stone has a&nbsp;tendency to rock on its bed, and also to wear round on the top and&nbsp;become slippery. To obtain an evener surface and a better foothold for the horses the stones were reduced in width, and in 1840&nbsp;a granite pavement was laid by Walker on Blackfriars Bridge,&nbsp;which may be considered the first of modern set pavements. The&nbsp;stones were 3 inches broad and 9 deep ; they were laid on a bed&nbsp;of concrete 1 foot thick and were jointed with mortar. The reduction of breadth to about 3 inches was generally followed, but it is&nbsp;only of late years that a concrete foundation has been employed to&nbsp;any great extent, the frequent breaking up to which streets are&nbsp;subject having prevented it. In London a foundation of broken&nbsp;stone has been continued in the chief thoroughfares, the sets being&nbsp;evenly bedded in gravel upon it and rammed with a heavy wooden&nbsp;rammer. Hard core—a mixture of broken stone, clinker, brick&nbsp;rubbish, and old building materials—has also been largely used to&nbsp;form a foundation. In the northern towns of England cinders&nbsp;have been employed, and where the traffic is exceptionally heavy&nbsp;a pitched foundation of stones on edge has been laid when the&nbsp;sets were not paved upon an old macadamized surface. The concrete for a foundation to a paved street should be made with the</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
