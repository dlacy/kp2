In all practical heat-engines, work is done through the expansion by heat of a fluid which overcomes resistance as it expands—in steam-engines by the expansion of water and water-vapour, in air-engines by the expansion of hot air, in gas-engines by the expansion of a burnt mixture of air and gas. One of the most simple and historically one of the oldest types of heat-engines are guns, in which heat, generated by the combustion of an explosive, does work in giving energy of motion to a projectile. But guns differ so widely from all other types, both in their purpose and in their development, that it is convenient to leave them out of account in treating of engines which may serve as prime movers to other mechanism.</p><p>I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Early History of the Steam-Engine.</hi></p><p>2. The earliest notices of heat-engines are found in the <hi rend="italic">Pneumatica</hi> of Hero of Alexandria (<hi rend="italic">c</hi>. 130 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.). Two</hi> contrivances described there deserve mention. One is the æolipile, a steam reaction-turbine consisting of a spherical vessel pivoted on a central axis and supplied with steam through one of the pivots. The steam escapes by bent pipes facing tangentially in opposite directions, at opposite ends of a diameter perpendicular to the axis. The globe revolves by reaction from the escaping steam, just as a Barker’s mill is driven by escaping water. Another apparatus described by Hero (fig. 1)<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> From Greenwood’s·translation of Hero’s <hi rend="italic">Ρneumatica.</hi> </note> is interesting as the prototype of a class of</p><p>engines which long after</p><p>wards became practically</p><p>important. A hollow</p><p>altar containing air is</p><p>heated by a fire kindled</p><p>on it ; the air in expand</p><p>ing drives some of the</p><p>water contained in a</p><p>spherical vessel beneath</p><p>the altar into a bucket,</p><p>which descends and</p><p>opens the temple doors</p><p>above by pulling round</p><p>a pair of vertical posts</p><p>to which the doors are</p><p>fixed. When the fire is</p><p>extinguished the air cools, the water leaves the bucket, and the doors close. In another device a jet of water driven out by expanding air is turned to account as a fountain.</p><p>3. From the time of Hero to the 17th century there is no progress to record, though here and there we find evidence that appliances like those described by Hero were used for trivial purposes, such as organ-blowing and the turning of spits. The next distinct step was the publication in 1601 of a treatise on pneumatics by Giovanni Battista della Porta, in which he shows an apparatus similar to Hero’s fountain, but with steam instead of air as the displacing fluid. Steam generated in a separate vessel passes into a closed chamber containing water, from which a pipe (open under the water) leads out. He also points out that the condensation of steam in the closed chamber may be used to produce a vacuum and suck up water from a lower level. In fact, his suggestions anticipate very fully the engine which a century later became in the hands of Savery the earliest commercially successful steam-engine.</p><p>In 1615 Solomon de Caus gives a plan of forcing up water by a steam fountain which differs from Della Porta’s only in having one vessel serve both as boiler and as displacement-chamber, the hot water being itself raised.</p><p>4. Another line of invention was taken by Giovanni Branca (1629), who designed an engine shaped like a water-wheel, to be driven by the impact of a jet of steam on its vanes, and, in its turn, to drive other mechanism for various useful purposes. But Branca’s suggestion was unproductive, and we find the course of invention revert to the line followed by Della Porta and De Caus.</p><p>5. The next contributor is one whose place is not easily assigned. To Edward Somerset, second marquis of Worcester, appears to be due the credit of making the first useful steam-engine. Its object was to raise water, and it worked probably like Della Porta’s model, but with a pair of displacement-chambers, from each of which alternately water was forced by steam from an independent boiler, or perhaps by applying heat to the chamber itself, while the other vessel was allowed to refill. Lord Worcester’s description of the engine in his <hi rend="italic">Century of Inventions</hi> (1663) is obscure, and no drawings are extant. It is therefore difficult to say whether there were any distinctly novel features except the double action ; in particular it is not clear whether the suction of a vacuum was used to raise water as well as the direct pressure of steam. An engine of about two horse-power was in use at Vauxhall in 1656, and the walls of Raglan Castle contain traces of another, but neither Worcester’s efforts nor those of his widow were successful in securing the commercial success of his engine.</p><p>6. This success was reserved for Thomas Savery, who in 1698 obtained a patent for a water-raising engine, shown in fig. 2. Steam is admitted to one of the oval vessels A, displacing water, which it drives</p><p>up through the check-valve B. When the</p><p>vessel A is emptied</p><p>of water, the supply</p><p>of steam is stopped,</p><p>and the steam al</p><p>ready there is con</p><p>densed by allowing</p><p>a jet of cold water</p><p>from a cistern above</p><p>to stream over the</p><p>outer surface of the</p><p>vessel. This pro</p><p>duces a vacuum and</p><p>causes water to be</p><p>sucked up through</p><p>the pipe C and the</p><p>valve D. Mean</p><p>while, steam has</p><p>been displacing</p><p>water from the other</p><p>vessel, and is ready</p><p>to be condensed</p><p>there. The valves B and D open only upwards. The supplementary boiler and furnace E are for feeding water to the main boiler ; E is filled while cold and a fire is lighted under it; it then acts like the vessel of De Caus in forcing a supply of feed-water into the main boiler F. The gauge-cocks G, G are an interesting feature of detail. Another form of Savery’s engine had only one displacement- chamber and worked intermittently. In the use of artificial means to condense the steam, and in the application</p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s06-0474" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0498.jp2"/><p><label><?xml version="I.O" encoding="utf-8"?> unknown title unknown author <editionStmt> <edition> <date> unknown date <,date> <,edition> <,editionStmt>  unknown <,p>  Converted from a Word document with eb-docx2tei. <,p> <encodingDesc> <appInfo> <application ident="TEI_fromDOCX" version="2.I5.O" xml:id="docxtotei">  Knowledge Project: DOCX to TEI  <,application> <,appInfo> <,encodingDesc> <revisionDesc> <listChange> <change> <date> 2OI9-OI-2OT22:38:O3Z <,date> <name> unknown author <,name> <,change> <,listChange> <,revisionDesc>  of the vacuum so formed to raise water by suction from a level lower than that of the engine, Savery’s engine was probably an improvement on Worcester’s ; in any case it found what Worcester’s engine had failed to find,—considerable employment in pumping mines and in raising water to supply houses and towns, and even to drive waterwheels. A serious difficulty which prevented its general use in mines was the fact that the height through which it would lift water was limited by the pressure the boiler and vessels could bear. Pressures as high as 8 or IO atmospheres were employed—and that, too, without a safety-valve—but Savery found it no easy matter to deal with high-pressure steam ; he complains that it melted his common solder, and forced him, as Desaguliers tells us, “to be at the pains and charge to have all his joints soldered with spelter.” Apart from this drawback the waste of fuel was enormous, from the condensation of steam which took place on the surface of the water and on the sides of the displacement-chamber at each stroke ; the consumption of coal, was, in proportion to the work done, some twenty times greater than in a good modern steam- engine. In a tract called <hi rend="italic">The Miner's Friend, <,hi> Savery alludes thus to the alternate heating and cooling of the water-vessel : “On the outside of the vessel you may see how the water goes out as well as if the vessel were transparent, for so far as the steam continues within the vessel so far is the vessel dry without, and so very hot as scarce to endure the least touch of the hand. But as far as the water is, the said vessel will be cold and wet where any water has fallen on it ; which cold and moisture vanishes as fast as the steam in its descent takes place of the water.” Before Savery’s engine was entirely displaced by its successor, Newcomen’s, it was improved by Desaguliers, who applied to it the safety valve (invented by Papin), and substituted condensation by a jet of cold water within the vessel for the surface condensation used by Savery. <,p>  7. So early as I678 the use of a piston and cylinder (long before known as applied to pumps) in a heat-engine had been suggested by Jean Heautefeuille, who proposed to use the explosion of gunpowder either to raise a piston or to force up water, or to produce, by the subsequent cooling of the gases, a partial vacuum into which water might be sucked up. Two years later Huygens described an engine in which the explosion of gunpowder in a cylinder expelled part of the gaseous contents, after which the cooling of the remainder caused a piston to descend under atmospheric pressure, and the piston in descending did work by raising a weight. <,p>  8. In I69O Denis Papin, who ten years before had invented the safety-valve as an adjunct to his “digester,” 'suggested that the condensation of steam should be employed to make a vacuum under a piston previously raised by the expansion of the steam. Papin’s was the earliest cylinder and piston steam-engine, and his plan of using <,p>  steam was that which afterwards took practical shape in the atmospheric engine of Newcomen. But <,p>  his scheme was made unworkable by the fact that he proposed to use but one vessel as both boiler and cylinder. <,p>  A small quantity of water was placed at the bottom of a cylinder and heat was applied. When the piston had risen the fire was removed, the steam was allowed to cool, and the piston did work in its down-stroke under the pressure of the atmosphere. After hearing of Savery’s engine in I7O5 Papin turned his attention to improving it, and devised a modified form, shown in fig. 3, in which the displacement- chamber A was a cylinder, with a floating diaphragm or piston on the top of the water to keep the water and steam from direct contact with one another. The water was delivered into a closed air-vessel B, from which it issued in a continuous stream against the vanes of a water-wheel. After the steam had done its work in the displacement- chamber it was allowed to escape by the stop-cock C instead of being condensed. Papin’s engine was in fact a non-condensing single-acting steam-pump, with steam-cylinder and pump-cylinder in one. A curious feature of it was the heater D, a hot mass of metal placed in the diaphragm for the purpose of keeping the steam dry. Among the many inventions of Papin was a boiler with an internal fire-box,—the earliest example of a construction that is now almost universal.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="2"> For an account of Papin’s inventions, see his <hi rend="italic">Life and Letters, <,hi> by Dr E. Gerland, Berlin, I88I. <,note> <,p>  9. While Papin was thus going back from his first notion of a piston-engine to Savery’s cruder type, a new inventor had appeared who made the piston-engine a practical success by separating the boiler from the cylinder and by using (as Savery had done) artificial means to condense the steam. This was Newcomen, who in I7O5, with his assistant Cawley, gave the steam-engine the form shown in fig. 4. Steam admitted from the boiler to the cylinder allowed the piston to be <,p>  raised by a heavy counterpoise <,p>  on the other side of the beam. <,p>  Then the steam- <,p>  valve was shut and <,p>  a jet of cold water <,p>  entered the cylinder <,p>  and condensed the <,p>  steam. The piston <,p>  was consequently <,p>  forced down by the <,p>  pressure of the at <,p>  mosphere and did <,p>  work on the pump., <,p>  The next entry of <,p>  steam expelled the <,p>  condensed water <,p>  from the cylinder <,p>  through an escape <,p>  valve. The piston was kept tight by a layer of water on its upper surface. Condensation was at first effected by cooling the outside of the cylinder, but the accidental leakage of the packing water past the piston showed the advantage of condensing by a jet of injection water, and this plan took the place of surface condensation. The engine used steam whose pressure was little if at all greater than that of the atmosphere ; sometimes indeed it was worked with the manhole lid off the boiler. <,p>  IO. About I7II Newcomen’s engine began to be introduced for pumping mines; and in I7I3 a boy named Humphrey Potter, whose duty it was to open and shut the valves of an engine he attended, made the engine selfacting by causing the beam itself to open and close the valves by suitable cords and catches. Potter’s rude device was simplified in I7I8 by Henry Beighton, who suspended from the beam a rod called the plug-tree, which worked the valves by means of tappets. By I725 the engine was in common use in collieries, and it held its place without material change for about three-quarters of a century in <,p</label>>

Near the close of its career the atmospheric engine was much improved in its mechanical details by Smeaton, who built many large engines of this type about the year I77O, just after the great step which was to make Newcomen’s engine obsolete had been taken by James Watt. <,p>  Compared with Savery’s engine, Newcomen’s had (as a pumping-engine) the great advantage that the intensity of pressure in the pumps was not in any way limited by the pressure of the steam. It shared with Savery’s, in a scarcely less degree, the defect already pointed out, that steam was wasted by the alternate heating and cooling of the vessel into which it was led. Though obviously capable of more extended uses, it was in fact almost exclusively employed to raise water,—in some instances for the purpose of turning water-wheels to drive other machinery. Even contemporary writers complain of its “ vast consumption of fuel,” which appears to have been scarcely smaller than that of the engine of Savery. <,p>  II. In I763 James Watt, an instrument maker in Glasgow, while engaged by the university in repairing a model of Newcomen’s engine, was struck with the waste of steam to which the alternate chilling and heating of the cylinder gave rise. He saw that the remedy, in his own words, would lie in keeping the cylinder as hot as the steam that entered it. With this view he added to the engine a new organ—an empty vessel separate from the cylinder, into which the steam should be allowed to escape from the cylinder, to be condensed there by the application of cold water either outside or as a jet. To preserve the vacuum in his condenser he added a pump called the air-pump, whose function was to pump from it the condensed steam and water of condensation, as well as the air which would otherwise accumulate by leakage or by being brought in with the steam or with the injection water. Then as the cylinder was no longer used as a condenser he was able to keep it hot by clothing it with non-conducting bodies, and in particular by the use of a <hi rend="italic">steam- jacket, <,hi> or layer of hot steam between the cylinder and an external casing. Further, and still with the same object, he covered in the top of the cylinder, taking the piston-rod out through a steam-tight stuffing-box, and allowed steam instead of air to press upon the piston’s upper surface. The idea of using a separate condenser had no sooner occurred to Watt than he put it to the test by constructing the apparatus shown in fig. 5. There A is the cylinder, B a surface condenser, and C the <,p>  air-pump. The cylinder was filled <,p>  with steam above the piston, and <,p>  a vacuum was formed in the sur <,p>  face condenser B. On opening <,p>  the stop-cock D the steam rushed <,p>  over from the cylinder and was <,p>  condensed, while the piston rose <,p>  and lifted a weight. After seve <,p>  ral trials Watt patented his im <,p>  provements in I769; they are <,p>  described in his specification in <,p>  the following words, which, apart from their immense historical interest, deserve careful study as a statement of principles which to this day guide the scientific development of the steam-engine :— <,p>  “ My method of lessening the consumption of steam, and consequently fuel, in fire-engines, consists of the following principles :— <,p>  <hi rend="italic">“First, <,hi> That vessel in which the powers of steam are to be employed to work the engine, which is called the cylinder in common fire-engines, and which I call the steam-vessel, must, during the whole time the engine is at work, be kept as hot as the steam that enters it ; first by enclosing it in a case of wood, or any other materials that transmit heat slowly ; secondly, by surrounding it with steam or other heated bodies ; and, thirdly, by suffering neither water nor any other substance colder than the steam to enter or touch it during that time. <,p>  <hi rend="italic">“Secondly, <,hi> In engines that are to be worked wholly or partially by condensation of steam, the steam is to be condensed in vessels distinct from the steam-vessels or cylinders, although occasionally communicating with them; these vessels I call condensers; and, whilst the engines are working, these condensers ought at least to be kept as cold as the air in the neighbourhood of the engines, by application of water or other cold bodies. <,p>  <hi rend="italic">“Thirdly, <,hi> Whatever air or other elastic vapour is not condensed by the cold of the condenser, and may impede the working of the engine, is to be drawn out of the steam-vessels or condensers by means of pumps, wrought by the engines themselves, or otherwise. <,p>  <hi rend="italic">“Fourthly, <,hi> I intend in many cases to employ the expansive force of steam to press on the pistons, or whatever may be used instead of them, in the same manner in which the pressure of the atmosphere is now employed in common fire-engines. In cases where cold water cannot be had in plenty, the engines may be wrought by this force of steam only, by discharging the steam into the air after it has done its office. . . . <,p>  <hi rend="italic">“Sixthly, <,hi> I intend in some cases to apply a degree of cold not capable of reducing the steam to water, but of contracting it considerably, so that the engines shall be worked by the alternate expansion and contraction of the steam. <,p>  <hi rend="italic">“ Lastly, <,hi> Instead of using water to render the pistons and other parts of the engine air and steam tight, I employ oils, wax, resinous bodies, fat of animals, quicksilver and other metals in their fluid state. ” <,p>  The fifth claim was for a rotary engine, and need not be quoted here. <,p>  The “ common fire-engine ” alluded to was the steam- engine, or, as it was more generally called, the “atmospheric” engine of Newcomen. Enormously important as Watt’s first patent was, it resulted for a time in the production of nothing more than a greatly improved engine of the Newcomen type, much less wasteful of fuel, able to make faster strokes, but still only suitable for pumping, still single-acting, with steam admitted during the whole stroke, the piston, as before, pulling the beam by a chain working on a circular arc. The condenser was generally worked by injection, but Watt has left a model of a surface condenser made up of small tubes, in every essential respect like the condensers now used in marine engines. <,p>  I2. Fig. 6 is an example of the Watt pumping-engine of this period. It should be noticed that, although the top of the cylinder is <,p>  closed and steam has ac <,p>  cess to the upper side of <,p>  the piston, this is done <,p>  only to keep the cylinder <,p>  and piston <,p>  warm. The <,p>  engine is still <,p>  single-acting ; <,p>  the steam in <,p>  the upper side <,p>  merely plays <,p>  the part which <,p>  was played <,p>  in Newcomen’s engine <,p>  by the atmosphere; and it <,p>  is the lower <,p>  end of the <,p>  cylinder alone <,p>  that is ever <,p>  put in communication with <,p>  the condenser. <,p>  There are three <,p>  valves, — the <,p>  “ steam ” valve <hi rend="italic">a, <,hi> the “ equilibrium ” valve <hi rend="italic">b, <,hi> and the “ exhaust ” valve <hi rend="italic">c. <,hi> At the beginning of the down-stroke <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> is opened to produce a vacuum below the piston and <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> is <,p</label>>

At the end of the down- stroke <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> are shut and <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> is opened. This puts the two sides in equilibrium, and allows the piston to be pulled up by the pump-rod P, which is heavy enough to serve as a counterpoise. C is the condenser, and A the air-pump, which discharges into the hot well H, whence the supply of the feed-pump F is drawn. <,p>  I3. In a second patent (I78I) Watt describes the “sun- and-planet” wheels and other methods of making the engine give continuous revolving motion to a shaft provided with a fly-wheel. He had invented the crank and connecting-rod for this purpose, but it had meanwhile been patented by one Pickard, and Watt, rather than make terms with Pickard, whom he regarded as a plagiarist of his own ideas, made use of his sun-and-planet motion until the patent on the crank expired. The reciprocating motion of earlier forms had served only for pumping; by this invention Watt opened up for the steam-engine a thousand other channels of usefulness. The engine was still single-acting ; the connecting rod was attached to the far end of the beam, and that carried a counterpoise which served to raise the piston when steam was admitted below it. <,p>  I4. In I782 Watt patented two further improvements of the first importance, both of which he had invented some years before. One was the use of double action, that is to say, the application of steam and vacuum to each side of the piston alternately. The other (invented as early as I769) was the use of steam expansively, in other words the plan (now used in all engines that aim at economy of fuel) of stopping the admission of steam when the piston had made only a part of its stroke, and allowing the rest of the stroke to be performed by the expansion of the steam already in the cylinder. To let the piston push as well as pull the end of the beam Watt devised his so-called parallel motion, an arrangement of links connecting the piston- <,p>  rod head with the beam in <,p>  such a way as to guide <,p>  the rod to move in a <,p>  very nearly straight <,p>  line. He further added <,p>  the throttle-valve, for <,p>  regulating the rate of <,p>  admission of steam, and <,p>  the centrifugal gover <,p>  nor, a double conical <,p>  pendulum, which con <,p>  trolled the speed by <,p>  acting on the throttle- <,p>  valve. The stage of de <,p>  velopment reached <,p>  at this time is illus <,p>  trated by the en <,p>  gine of fig. 7 (from <,p>  Stuart’s <hi rend="italic">History of <,hi> <,p>  <hi rend="italic">the Steam-Engine), <,hi> <,p>  which shows the <,p>  parallel motion <hi rend="italic">pp, <,hi> <,p>  the governor <hi rend="italic">g, <,hi> the <,p>  throttle-valve <hi rend="italic">t, <,hi> and a pair of steam and exhaust valves at each end of the cylinder. Among other inventions of Watt were the “ indicator,” by which diagrams showing the relation of the steam-pressure in the cylinder to the movement of the piston are automatically drawn ; a steam tilt-hammer ; and also a steam locomotive for ordinary roads,—but this invention was not prosecuted. <,p>  In partnership with Matthew Boulton, Watt carried on in Birmingham the manufacture and sale of his engines with the utmost success, and held the field against all <,p>  rivals in spite of severe assaults on the validity of his patents. Notwithstanding his accurate knowledge of the advantage to be gained by using steam expansively he continued to employ only low pressures—seldom more than 7 lb per square inch over that of the atmosphere. His boilers were fed, as Newcomen’s had been, through an open pipe which rose high enough to let the column of water in it balance the pressure of the steam. He introduced the term “horse-power” as a mode of rating engines, defining one horse-power as the rate at which work is done when 33,OOO lb) are raised one foot in one minute. This estimate was based on trials of the work done by horses ; it is excessive as a statement of what an average horse can do, but Watt purposely made it so in order that his customers might have no reason to complain on this score. <,p>  I5. In the fourth claim in Watt’s first patent, the second sentence describes a non-condensing engine, which would have required steam of a higher pressure. This, however, was a line of invention which Watt did not follow up, perhaps because so early as I725 a non-condensing engine had been described by Leupold in his <hi rend="italic">Theatrum Machinarum. <,hi> Leupold’s proposed engine is shown in fig. 8, which makes its action sufficiently clear. Watt’s aversion to high-pressure steam was strong, and its influence on <,p>  steam-engine practice long sur <,p>  vived the expiry of his patents. <,p>  So much indeed was this the <,p>  case that the terms “high- <,p>  pressure” and “non-condens <,p>  ing” were for many years <,p>  synonymous, in contra <,p>  distinction to the “low- <,p>  pressure ” or condensing <,p>  engines of Watt. This <,p>  nomenclature no longer <,p>  holds ; in modern practice <,p>  many condensing engines <,p>  use as high pressures as <,p>  non-condensing engines, <,p>  and by doing so are able <,p>  to take advantage of <,p>  Watt’s great invention <,p>  of expansive working to a degree which was impossible in his own practice. <,p>  I6. The introduction of the non-condensing and, at that time, relatively high-pressure engine, was effected in England by Trevithick and in America by Oliver Evans about I8OO. Both Evans and Trevithick applied their engines to propel carriages on roads, and both used for boiler a cylindrical vessel with a cylindrical flue inside— the construction now known as the Cornish boiler. In partnership with Bull, Trevithick had previously made direct-acting pumping-engines, with an inverted cylinder set over and in line with the pump-rod, thus dispensing with the beam that had been a feature in all earlier forms. But in these “ Bull ” engines, as they were called, a condenser was used, or, rather, the steam was condensed by a jet of cold water in the exhaust-pipe, and Boulton and Watt successfully opposed them as infringing Watt’s patents. To Trevithick belongs the distinguished honour of being the first to use a steam-carriage on a railway ; in I8O4 he built a locomotive in the modern sense, to run on what had formerly been a horse-tramway in Wales, and it is noteworthy that the exhaust steam was discharged into the funnel to force the furnace draught, a device which, 25 years later, in the hands of George Stephenson, went far to make the locomotive what it is to-day. In this connexion it may be added that as early as I769 a steam- <,p</label>>

To the initiative of Evans may be ascribed the early general use of high-pressure steam in the United States, a feature which for many years distinguished American from English practice. <,p>  I7. Amongst the contemporaries of Watt one name deserves special mention. In I78I Jonathan Hornblower constructed and patented what would now be called a compound engine, with two cylinders of different sizes. Steam was first admitted into the smaller cylinder, and then passed over into the larger, doing work against a piston in each. In Hornblower’s engine the two cylinders were placed side by side, and both pistons worked on the same end of a beam overhead. This was an instance of the use of steam expansively, and as such was earlier than the patent, though not earlier than the invention, of expansive working by Watt. Hornblower was crushed by the Birmingham firm for infringing their patent in the use of a separate condenser and air-pump. The compound engine was revived in I8O4 by Woolf, with whose name it is often associated. Using steam of fairly high pressure, and cutting off the supply before the end of the stroke in the small cylinder, Woolf expanded the steam to several times its original volume. Mechanically the double-cylinder compound engine has this advantage over an engine in which the same amount of expansion is performed in a single cylinder, that the sum of the forces exerted by the two pistons in the compound engine varies less throughout the action than the force exerted by the piston of the single-cylinder engine. This advantage may have been clear to Hornblower and Woolf, and to other early users of compound expansion. But another and probably a more important merit of the system lies in a fact of which neither they nor for many years their followers in the use of compound engines were aware—the fact that by dividing the whole range of expansion into two parts the cylinders in which these are separately performed are subject to a reduced range of fluctuation in their temperature. This, as will be afterwards pointed out, limits to a great extent a source of waste which is present in all steam-engines, the waste which results from the heating and cooling of the metal by its alternate contact with hot and cooler steam. The system of compound expansion is now used in nearly all large engines that pretend to economy. Its introduction forms the only great improvement which the steam-engine has undergone since the time of Watt; and we are able to recognize it as a very important step in the direction set forth in his “first principle,” that the cylinder should be kept as hot as the steam that enters it. <,p>  I8. Woolf introduced the compound engine somewhat widely about I8I4, as a pumping engine in the mines of Cornwall. But here it met a strong competitor in the high-pressure single-cylinder engine of Trevithick, which had the advantage of greater simplicity in construction. Woolf’s engine fell into comparative disuse, and the singlecylinder type took a form which, under the name of the Cornish pumping engine, was for many years famous for its great economy of fuel. In this engine the cylinder was set under one end of a beam, from the other end of which hung a heavy rod which operated a pump at the foot of the shaft. Steam was admitted above the piston for a short portion of the stroke, thereby raising the pump- rod, and was allowed to expand for the remainder. Then an equilibrium valve, connecting the space above and below the piston, as in fig. 6, was opened, and the pump-rod descended, doing work in the pump and raising the engine piston. The large mass which had to be started <,p>  and stopped at each stroke served by its inertia to counterbalance the unequal pressure of the steam, for the ascending rods stored up energy of motion in the early part of the stroke, when the steam pressure was greatest, and gave out energy in the later part, when expansion had greatly lowered the pressure. The frequency of the stroke was controlled by a device called a cataract, consisting of a small plunger pump, in which the plunger, raised at each stroke by the engine, was allowed to descend more or less slowly by the escape of fluid below it through an adjustable orifice, and in its descent liberated catches which held the steam and exhaust valves from opening. A similar device controlled the equilibrium valve, and could be set to give a pause at the end of the piston’s down-stroke, so that the pump cylinder might have time to become completely filled. The Cornish engine is interesting as the earliest form which achieved an efficiency comparable with that of good modern engines. For many years monthly reports were published of the “ duty ” of these engines, the “ duty ” being the number of footpounds of work done per bushel or (in some cases) per cwt. of coal. The average duty of engines in the Cornwall district rose from about I8 millions of foot-pounds per cwt. of coal in I8I3 to 68 millions in I844, after which less effort seems to have been made to maintain a high efficiency.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="3"> <hi rend="italic">Min. Proc. Inst. C.B., <,hi> vol. xxiii., I863. <,note> In individual cases much higher results were reported, as in the Fowey Consols engine, which in I835 was stated to have a duty of I25 millions. This (to use a more modern mode of reckoning) is equivalent to the consumption of only a little more than I,lb of coal per horse-power per hour—a result surpassed by very few engines in even the best recent practice. It is difficult to credit figures which, even in exceptional instances, place the Cornish engine of that period on a level with the most efficient modern engines—in which compound expansion and higher pressure combine to make a much more perfect thermodynamic machine ; and apart from this there is room to question the accuracy of the Cornish reports. They played, however, a useful part in the process of steam-engine development by directing attention to the question of efficiency, and by demonstrating the advantage to be gained by high pressure and expansive working, at a time when the theory of the steam- engine had not yet taken shape. <,p>  I9. The final revival of the compound engine did not occur until about the middle of the century, and then several agencies combined to effect it. In I845 M‘Naught introduced a plan of improving beam engines of the original Watt type, by adding a high-pressure cylinder whose piston acted on the beam between the centre and the fly-wheel end. Steam of higher pressure than had formerly been used, after doing work in the new cylinder, passed into the old or low-pressure cylinder, where it was further expanded. Many engines whose power was proving insufficient for the extended machinery they had to drive were “M'Naughted ” in this way, and after conversion were found not only to yield more power but to show a marked economy of fuel. The compound form was selected by Mr Pole for the pumping engines of Lambeth and other waterworks about I85O; in I854 John Elder began to use it in marine engines; in I857 Mr Cowper added a steam-jacketed intermediate reservoir for steam between the high and low pressure cylinders, which made it unnecessary for the low-pressure piston to be just beginning when the other piston was just ending its stroke. As facilities increased for the use of high-pressure steam, compound expansion became more and more general, its advantage becoming more conspicuous with every <,p</label>>

In marine practice, where economy of fuel is a much more important factor in determining the design than it is on land, the principle of compound expansion has lately been greatly extended by the introduction of triple and even quadruple expansion engines, in which the steam is made to expand successively in three or in four cylinders. Even in the building of locomotive engines, where other considerations are of more moment than the saving of coal, the system of compound expansion is beginning to find a place. <,p>  The growth of compound expansion has been referred to at some length, because it forms the most distinctive improvement which the steam-engine has undergone since the time of Watt. For the rest, the progress of the steam- engine has consisted in its adaptation to particular uses, in the invention of features of mechanical detail, in the recognition and application of thermodynamical principles, and in improved methods of engineering construction by which it has profited in common with all other machines. These have in particular made possible the use of steam of eight or ten times the pressure of that employed by Watt. <,p>  2O. The adaptation of the steam-engine to railways, begun by Trevithick, became a success in the hands of George Stephenson, whose engine the “ Rocket,” when tried along with others on the Stockton and Darlington road in I829, not only distanced its competitors but settled once and for all the question whether horse traction or steam traction was to be used on railways. The principal features of the “ Rocket ” were an improved steam-blast for urging the combustion of coal and a boiler (suggested by Booth, the secretary of the railway) in which a large heating surface was given by the use of many small tubes through which the hot gases passed. Further, the cylinders, instead of being vertical as in earlier locomotives, were set in at a slope, which was afterwards altered to a position more nearly horizontal. To these features there was added later the “ link motion,” a contrivance which enabled the engine to be easily reversed and the amount of expansion to be readily varied. In the hands of George Stephenson and his son Robert the locomotive took a form which has been in all essentials maintained by the far heavier locomotives of to-day. <,p>  2I. The first practical steamboat was the tug “Charlotte Dundas,” built by William Symmington, and tried in the Forth and Clyde Canal in I8O2. A Watt double-acting condensing engine, placed horizontally, acted directly by a connecting-rod on the crank of a shaft at the stern, which carried a revolving paddle-wheel. The trial was successful, but steam towing was abandoned for fear of injuring the banks of the canal. Ten years later Henry Bell built the “ Comet,” with side paddle- wheels, which ran as a passenger steamer on the Clyde ; but an earlier inventor to follow up Symmington’s success was the American Robert Fulton, who, after unsuccessful experiments on the Seine, fitted a steamer on the Hudson in I8O7 with engines made to his designs by Boulton and Watt, and brought steam navigation for the first time to commercial success. <,p>  22. The early inventors had little in the way of theory to guide them. Watt had the advantage, which he acknowledges, of a knowledge of Black’s doctrine of latent heat; but there was no philosophy of the relation of work to heat until long after the inventions of Watt were complete. The theory of the steam-engine as a heat-engine dates from I824, when Carnot published his <hi rend="italic">Reflexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu, <,hi> and showed <,p>  that heat does work only by being let down from a higher to a lower temperature. But Carnot had no idea that any of the heat disappears in the process, and it was not until the doctrine of the conservation of energy was established in I843 by the experiments of Joule that the theory of heat-engines began a vigorous growth. From I849 onwards the science of thermodynamics was developed with extraordinary rapidity by Clausius, Rankine, and Thomson, and was applied, especially by Rankine, to practical problems in the use of steam. The publication in I859 of Rankine’s <hi rend="italic">Manual of the Steam Engine <,hi> formed an epoch in the history of the subject by giving inventors a new basis, outside of mere empiricism, from which they could push on the development of the steam-engine. Unfortunately, however, for its bearing on practice, the theory of the steam-engine was to a great extent founded on certain simplifying assumptions which experience has notv shown to be far from correct. It was assumed that the cylinder and piston might be treated as behaving to the steam like non-conducting bodies,—that the transfer of heat between the steam and the metal was negligibly small. Rankine’s calculations of steam-consumption, work, and thermodynamic efficiency involve this assumption, except in the case of steam-jacketed cylinders, where he estimates that the steam in its passage through the cylinder takes just enough heat from the jacket to prevent a small amount of condensation which would otherwise occur as the process of expansion goes on. If the transfer of heat from steam to metal could be overlooked, the steam which enters the cylinder would remain during admission as dry as it was before it entered, and the volume of steam consumed per stroke would correspond with the volume of the cylinder up to the point of cut-off. It is here that the actual behaviour of steam in the cylinder diverges most widely from the behaviour which the theory assumes. When steam enters the cylinder it finds the metal chilled by the previous exhaust, and a portion of it is at once condensed. This has the effect of increasing, often very largely, the volume of boiler steam required per stroke. As expansion goes on the water that was condensed during admission begins to be re-evaporated from the sides of the cylinder, and this action is often prolonged into the exhaust. In a later chapter the effect which this exchange of heat between the metal of the cylinder and the working fluid produces on the economy of the engine will be discussed, and an account will be given of experimental means by which we may examine the amount of steam that is initially condensed and trace its subsequent re-evaporation. It is now recognized that any theory which fails to take account of these exchanges of heat fails also to yield even comparatively correct results in calculating the relative efficiency of various steam pressures or various ranges of expansion. But the exchanges of heat are so complex that there seems little prospect of submitting them to any comprehensive theoretical treatment, and we must rather look for help in the future development of engines to the scientific analysis of experiments with actual machines. Much careful work of this kind has already been done by Hirn and others, and there is room for much more. Questions relating to the influence (on heat-engine economy) of speed, of pressure, of ratio of expansion, of jacketing, of compound expansion, or of superheating must in the main be settled by an appeal to experiment,—experiment guided and interpreted at every step by reference to the principles of thermodynamics and the theory of steam. <,p>  <hi rend="italic">References.— <,hi> Stuart, <hi rend="italic">Descriptive History of the Steam-Engine, <,hi> I825 ; Farey, <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Steam-Engine, <,hi> I827 ; Tredgold, <hi rend="italic">The Steam-Engine, <,hi> I838 ; Muir- head's <hi rend="italic">Mechanical Inventions of James Watt, <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">Life of Watt; <,hi> Galloway, <hi rend="italic">The Steam-Engine and its Inventors <,hi> ; Thurston, <hi rend="italic">History of the Growth of the Steam- Engine; <,hi> Cowper on the Steam-Engine <hi rend="italic">{Heat Lectures Inst.

A heat-engine acts by taking in heat, converting a part of the heat received into mechanical energy, which appears as the work done by the engine, and rejecting the remainder, still in the form of heat. The theory of heat-engines comprises the study of the amount of work done, in its relation to the heat supplied and to the heat rejected. The theory is based on the two laws of thermodynamics, which may be stated here as follows :— <,p>  <hi rend="smallcaps">Law <,hi> I. <hi rend="italic">When mechanical energy is produced from heat, I thermal unit of heat goes out of existence for every 772 foot-pounds of work done; and, conversely, when heat is produced by the expenditure of mechanical energy, I thermal unit of heat comes into existence for every 772 foot-pounds of work spent. <,hi> <,p>  The “thermal unit” is the heat required to raise the temperature of I lb of water I degree Fahr. when at its temperature of maximum density. The equivalent quantity of work, 772 footpounds, was determined by the experiments of Joule, and is called Joule’s equivalent. Later researches by Joule and others have indicated that this number is probably too small; it should perhaps be as much as 774 foot-pounds. Joule’s original value is still generally used by engineers; and as it enters into many published tables it may conveniently be adhered to until its accuracy is more definitely disproved. Since a definite number of foot-pounds are equivalent to I thermal unit, we may, if we please, express quantities of work in thermal units, or quantities of heat in foot-pounds ; the latter practice will frequently be found useful. <,p>  <hi rend="smallcaps">Law <,hi> 2. <hi rend="italic">It is impossible for a self-acting machine, unaided by any external agency, to convey heat from one body to another at a higher temperature. <,hi> <,p>  This is the form in which the second law has been stated by Clausius. Another statement of it, different in form but similar in effect, has been given by Thomson. Its force may not be immediately obvious, but it will be shown below that it introduces a most important limitation of the power which any engine has of converting heat into work. So far as the first law shows, there is nothing to prevent the whole heat taken in by the engine from changing into mechanical energy. In consequence of the second law, however, no heat-engine converts, or can convert, more than a small fraction of the heat supplied to it into work ; a large part is necessarily rejected as heat. The ratio <,p>  Heat converted into work Heat taken in by the engine <,p>  is a fraction always much less than unity. This ratio is called the <hi rend="italic">efficiency <,hi> of the engine considered as a heat-engine. <,p>  24. In every heat-engine there is a <hi rend="italic">working substance <,hi> which takes in and rejects heat, thereby suffering changes of form, or more commonly of volume, and does work by overcoming resistance to these changes of form or volume. The working substance may be gaseous, liquid, or solid. We can, for example, imagine a heat- engine in which the working substance is a long metallic rod, arranged to act as the pawl of a ratchet-wheel with fine teeth. Let the rod be heated so that it elongates sufficiently to drive the wheel forward through the space of one tooth. Then let the rod be cooled (say by applying cold water), the wheel being meanwhile held from returning by a separate click or detent. The rod, on cooling, will retract so as to engage itself with the next succeeding tooth, which may then be driven forward by heating the rod again, and so on. To make it evident that such an engine would do work, we have only to suppose that the ratchet-wheel carries round with it a drum by which a weight is wound up. We have, then, a complete heat-engine, in which the working substance is a solid rod, which receives heat by being brought into contact with some source of heat at a comparatively high temperature, transforms a small part of this heat into work, and rejects the remainder to what we may call a receiver of heat, at a comparatively low temperature. The greater part of the heat may be said simply to pass through the engine, from the source to the receiver, <hi rend="italic">becoming degraded as regards temperature <,hi> as it goes. We shall see presently that this is typical of the action of all heat-engines ; when they are doing work, the heat which they reject is rejected at a temperature lower than that at which it is taken in. They convert some heat into work only by letting down a much larger quantity of heat from a high to a relatively low temperature. The action is analogous to that of a water-wheel, which does work by letting down water from a high to a lower level, but with this important difference that in the transfer which occurs in heat-engines an amount of heat disappears which is equivalent to the work done. <,p>  25. In almost all actual heat-engines the working substance is a fluid. In some it is air, in some a mixture of several gases. In the steam-engine the working fluid is a mixture (in varying proportions) of water and steam. With a fluid for working substance, work is done by changes of volume only ; its amount depends solely on the relation of pressure to volume during the change, and not at all on the form of the vessels in which the change takes place. Leta diagram be drawn (fig. 9) in which the relation of the intensity of pressure <,p>  to the volume of any supposed working substance is graphically exhibited by the line ABC, where AM, CN are pressures and AP, CQ are volumes, then the work done by the substance in expanding from A to C is the area of the figure MABCN, And similarly, if the substance be compressed from <,p>  C back to its original volume in such a manner that the line CDA represents the relation of pressure and volume during compression, the work done <hi rend="italic">upon <,hi> the substance is the figure NCDAM. Taking the two operations together, we find that the substance has done a net amount of work equal to the area of the shaded figure ABCDA, or ∫P <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> V. This is an example and a generalization of the method of representing work which Watt introduced by his invention of the indicator ; the figure ABCDA may be called the indicator diagram of the supposed action. <,p>  26. Generally in heat-engines the working substance returns periodically to the same state of temperature, pressure, volume, and physical condition. When this has occurred the substance is said to have passed through a complete cycle of operations. For example, in a condensing steam-engine, water taken from the hot- well is pumped into the boiler ; it then passes into the cylinder as steam, passes thence into the condenser, and thence again into the hot-well ; it completes the cycle by returning to the same condition as at first. In other less obvious cases, as in that of the non-condensing steam-engine, a little consideration will show that the cycle is completed, not indeed by the same portion of working substance being returned to the boiler, but by an equal quantity of water being fed to it, while the steam which has been discharged into the atmosphere cools to the temperature of the feed. In the theory of heat-engines it is of the first importance to consider (as was first done by Carnot in I824) the cycle of operations performed by the working substance as a complete whole. If we stop short of the completion of a cycle matters are complicated by the fact that the substance is in a state different from its initial state, and may therefore have changed its stock of internal energy. After a complete cycle, on the other hand, we know at once that, since the condition is the same, the internal energy of the substance is the same as at first, and therefore— <,p>  Heat taken in = work done + heat rejected. <,p>  27. It will serve our purpose best to approach the theory of heat-engines by considering, in the first instance, the action of an engine in which the working substance is any one of the so-called permanent gases, or a mixture of them, such as air. The word permanent, as applied to a gas, can now<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="4"> Since the liquefaction of hydrogen and other gases by MM. Cailletet and Pictet. <,note> be understood only as meaning that the gas is liquefied with difficulty—either by the use of extremely low temperature or extremely high pressure or both. So long as gases are under conditions of pressure and temperature widely different from those which produce liquefaction, they conform very approximately to certain simple laws—laws which may be regarded as <hi rend="italic">rigorously <,hi> applicable to ideal substances called <hi rend="italic">perfect <,hi> gases. After stating these laws briefly we shall examine the efficiency of a heat-engine using a gas in a certain manner as working substance, and then show that the conclusion so derived has a general application to all heat-engines whatsoever. In this procedure there is no sacrifice of generality, and a part of the process is of independent service in the discussion of actual air-engines. <,p>  28. The laws of the permanent gases are the following :— <,p>  <hi rend="smallcaps">Law <,hi> I (Boyle). <hi rend="italic">The volume of a given mass of gas varies <,hi> <,p>  <hi rend="italic">inversely as the pressure, the temperature being kept constant. <,hi> <,p>  Thus, if V be the volume of I lb of a gas in cubic feet, and P the pressure in pounds per square foot, so long as the temperature is unchanged— <,p>  P∞ V <hi rend="superscript"> -I <,hi> , or PV=constant. <,p>  For air the value of the constant is 2622O when the temperature is 32° F. <,p>  29. <hi rend="smallcaps">Law <,hi> 2 (Charles). <hi rend="italic">Under constant pressure equal volumes of different gases increase equally for the same increment of temperature. Also, if a gas be heated under constant pressure, equal increments of its volume correspond very nearly to equal intervals of temperature as determined by the scale of a mercury thermometer. <,hi> <,p>  Thus, let us take, say, 493 cubic inches of hydrogen, also of oxygen, of air, &amp;amp;c., all at 32° F., and, keeping each at a constant pressure (not necessarily the same for all), heat all so that their temperature rises I° F. We shall find that each has expanded by sensibly the same amount and now occupies 494 cubic inches. And further, if we heat any one through another I F. to 34 F., we shall find that its volume is now 495 cubic inches, and so on. Thus for any gas, kept at constant pressure, if the volume was <,p</label>>

This we may assume to be the case with a perfect gas, although any actual gas would change its physical state long before so low a temperature were reached. <,p>  This result may be concisely expressed by saying that if we reckon temperature, not from the ordinary zero but from a point 46I° below the zero of Fahrenheit’s scale, the volume of a given quantity of a gas, kept at constant pressure, is proportional to the temperature reckoned from that zero. Temperatures so reckoned are called absolute temperatures, and the point - 46I° F. is called the absolute zero of temperature. Denoting any temperature according to the ordinary scale by <hi rend="italic">t, <,hi> and the corresponding absolute temperature by τ, we have <,p>  τ = <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> + 46I on the Fahrenheit scale, and τ = <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> +274 on the Centigrade scale. <,p>  Charles’s law shows that if temperatures be measured by thermometers in which the expanding substance is air, hydrogen, oxygen, or any other permanent gas, and, if those intervals of temperature be called equal which correspond to equal amounts of expansion, then the indications of these thermometers always agree very closely with each other, and also agree, though less closely, with the indications of a mercury thermometer. We shall see later that the theory of heat-engines affords a means of forming a thermometric scale which is independent of the properties, as to expansion, of any substance, and that this scale coincides with the scale of a perfect gas thermometer, a fact which justifies the use of the term absolute, as applied to temperatures measured by the expansion of a gas. <,p>  3O. Combining laws I and 2, we have, for a given mass of any gas, <,p>  PV= <hi rend="italic">cτ <,hi> , <,p>  where c is a constant depending on the specific density of the gas and on the units in which P and V are measured. In what follows we shall assume that P is measured in pounds per square foot, that V is the volume of I lb in cubic feet, and that <hi rend="italic">τ <,hi> is the absolute temperature in Fahrenheit degrees.

The law states that this quantity is the same for any one gas, no matter what be the temperature, or what the constant pressure, at which the process of heating takes place. <,p>  32. Another important quantity in the theory of heat-engines is the specific heat at constant volume, that is, the heat taken in by I lb of the substance when its temperature rises I° F. while the volume remains unchanged—the pressure of course increasing. We shall denote specific heat at constant pressure by K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p <,hi> and specific heat at constant volume by K <hi rend="italic subscript"> v <,hi> .

Both vessels were immersed in a tub of water and were allowed to assume a uniform temperature. Then the stop-cock was opened, the gas expanded without doing external work, and finally the temperature of the water in the tub was found to have undergone no change. The temperature of the gas was unaltered, and no heat had been taken in or given out by it. <,p>  34. Since the gas had neither gained nor lost heat, and had done no work, its internal energy was the same at the end as at the beginning of the experiment. The pressure and volume had changed, but the temperature had not. We must therefore conclude that the internal energy of a given mass of a gas depends only on its temperature, and not upon its pressure or volume ; in other words, a change of pressure and volume not associated with a change of temperature does not alter the internal energy. Hence <,p>  in any change of temperature the change of internal energy is independent of the relation of pressure to volume throughout the operation. Now we have seen above that the quantity <,p>  (K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p <,hi> ,- <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> )(τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> -τ <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> ) <,p>  measures the gain of internal energy when I lb of a gas has its temperature changed from τ <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> in one particular way, namely, at constant pressure. Hence this same quantity also measures the gain of internal energy when I lb of a gas has its temperature changed from τ <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> in any manner whatsoever. <,p>  35. Next consider the case of I lb of a gas heated from τ <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> to τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> at constant volume. The heat taken in is <,p>  K <hi rend="italic subscript"> v <,hi> (τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> -τ <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> ). <,p>  Since no work is done, this is all gain of internal energy, and is therefore (§ 34) equal to <,p>  (K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p <,hi> - <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> )(τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> -τ <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> ). <,p>  Hence in any gas <,p>  K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p <,hi> - <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> =K <hi rend="italic subscript"> v <,hi> . <,p>  The ratio K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p <,hi> ∕K <hi rend="italic subscript"> v <,hi> . will be denoted by 7; obviously K <hi rend="italic subscript"> v <,hi> = <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> ∕(γ -I).

We shall now return to the consideration of diagrams like that of § 25, which exhibit the action of a working substance by curves showing the relation of P to V during expansion or compression. In most of the instances which occur in the theory of heat-engines such curves may be exactly or approximately represented by equations of the form <,p>  PV <hi rend="italic superscript"> n <,hi> =constant, <,p>  where the index <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> has various numer <,p>  ical values. Let AB, fig.

Applying this result to the case of an expanding gas, we have <,p>  Work done = <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> (τ <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> -τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> )∕(<hi rend="italic">n <,hi> -l). <,p>  The loss of internal energy during expansion is, by § 34, <,p>  K <hi rend="italic subscript"> v <,hi> (τ <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> - τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> ), or <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> (τ <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> - τ <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> ) ∕ (γ-I), by § 35. <,p>  Suppose now that the mode of expansion is such that the loss of internal energy is equal to the external work done, then <,p>  <hi rend="strikethrough">⅛ <,hi> <hi rend="subscript strikethrough"> lξ <,hi> <hi rend="strikethrough">t <,hi> <hi rend="subscript strikethrough"> 2 <,hi> <hi rend="strikethrough">)^ <,hi> c(t <hi rend="subscript"> I <,hi> -t <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> ) <hi rend="italic strikethrough smallcaps"> n-I <,hi> <hi rend="strikethrough smallcaps"> 7-I <,hi> <,p>  and the law of expansion is <,p>  PV <hi rend="superscript"> γ <,hi> = constant. <,p>  The same formula applies when a gas is being compressed in such a manner that the work spent upon the gas is equal to the gain of internal energy by the gas. <,p>  38.

Hence in the adiabatic expansion of a gas the temperature falls, and in adiabatic compression it rises. To find the change of temperature in a gas when expanded or compressed adiabatically we have only to combine the equations <,p>  Pvv- <hi rend="subscript"> w <,hi> a∏d^-n, <,p>  and we find <,p>  τ= τ(V∕V) <hi rend="superscript"> γ-I <,hi> . <,p>  It is clear from the above that if, during expansion, <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> is less than γ the fluid is taking in heat, and if <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> is greater than γ the fluid is rejecting heat. <,p>  39. Another very important mode of expansion or compression is that called <hi rend="italic">isothermal, <,hi> in which the temperature of the working substance is kept constant during the process. <,p>  In the case of a gas the curve of isothermal expansion is a rectangulaχ∙ hyperbola, having the equation <,p>  PV=constant= <hi rend="italic">cτ. <,hi> <,p>  When a gas expands (or is compressed) isothermally at temperature τ from Vto Vthe work done by (or upon) it (per lb) is <,p>  ∕*V∕* <hi rend="superscript"> v <,hi> 2&amp;lt;ZV <,p>  PdV≈Py(<hi rend="subscript"> ι <,hi> ^-=PVlog <hi rend="subscript"> e <,hi> r= <hi rend="subscript"> cτ <,hi> log <hi rend="subscript"> e <,hi> r, <,p>  where <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> is the ratio V∕Vas before.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="5"> In calculations where this expression is involved it is convenient to remember that log <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> , the hyperbolic logarithm, of any number is 2∙3O26 times the common logarithm of the number. <,note> <,p>  During isothermal expansion or compression a gas suffers no change of internal energy (by § 34, since τ is constant). Hence during isothermal expansion a gas must <,p>  take in an amount of heat just equal to <,p>  the work it does, and during isothermal <,p>  compression it must reject an amount <,p>  of heat just equal to the work spent <,p>  upon it. The expression cτlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> con <,p>  sequently measures, not only the work <,p>  done by or upon the gas, but also the <,p>  heat taken in during isothermal expan <,p>  sion or given out during isothermal <,p>  compression. In the diagram, fig. II, <,p>  the line AB is an example of a curve of isothermal expansion for a perfect gas, called for brevity an isothermal line, while AC is an adiabatic line starting from the same point A. <,p>  4O. We shall now consider the action of an ideal engine in which the working substance is a perfect gas, and is caused to pass through a cycle of changes <,p>  each of which is either isother <,p>  mal or adiabatic. The cycle <,p>  to be described was first exa <,p>  mined by Carnot, and is spoken <,p>  of as Carnot’s cycle of opera <,p>  tions. Imagine a cylindeι <hi rend="superscript"> - <,hi> and <,p>  piston composed of a perfectly <,p>  non - conducting material, <,p>  except as regards the bottom <,p>  of the cylinder, which is a <,p>  conductor. Imagine also a <,p>  hot body or indefinitely ca <,p>  pacious source of heat A, <,p>  kept always at a tempera <,p>  ture τ, a perfectly non <,p>  conducting cover B, and a <,p>  cold body or indefinitely <,p>  capacious receiver of heat C, kept always at a temperature τ, which is lower than τ. It is supposed that A, B, or C can be applied to the bottom of the cylinder. Let the cylinder contain I lb of a perfect gas, at temperature τ, volume V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a <,hi> , and pressure P <hi rend="italic subscript"> a <,hi> to begin with. The suffixes refer to the points on the indicator diagram, fig- I2. <,p>  (I) Apply A, and allow the piston to rise. The gas expands isothermally at τ, taking heat from A and doing work. The pressure changes to P <hi rend="italic subscript"> b <,hi> and the volume to V <hi rend="italic subscript"> b <,hi> . <,p>  (2) Remove A and apply B. Allow the piston to go on rising. The gas expands adiabatically, doing work at the expense of its internal energy, and the temperature falls. Let this go on until the temperature is τ, The pressure is then P <hi rend="italic subscript"> c <,hi> , and the volume V <hi rend="italic subscript"> c <,hi> . <,p>  (3) Remove B and apply C. Force the piston down. The gas is compressed isothermally at τ, since the smallest increase of temperature above τcauses heat to pass into C. Work is spent upon the gas, and heat is rejected to C. Let this be continued until a certain point <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> (fig. I2) is reached, such that the fourth operation will complete the cycle. <,p>  (4) Remove C and apply B. Continue the compression, which is now adiabatic. The pressure and temperature rise, and if the point <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> has been properly chosen, when the pressure is restored to its original value P <hi rend="italic subscript"> a <,hi> , the temperature will also have risen to its <,p>  original value τ. [In other words, the third operation must be stopped when a point <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> is reached such that an adiabatic line drawn through <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> will pass through <hi rend="italic">a. <,hi> ] This completes the cycle. <,p>  To find the proper place at which to stop the third operation, we have, by § 38, τ∕τ= (V <hi rend="italic subscript"> c <,hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> b <,hi> ) <hi rend="superscript"> γ-I <,hi> in the second operation, and again τ∕τ=(V <hi rend="italic subscript"> d <,hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a <,hi> ) <hi rend="superscript"> γ-I <,hi> in the fourth operation. Hence V <hi rend="italic subscript"> c <,hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> b <,hi> = V <hi rend="italic subscript"> d <,hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a <,hi> , and V <hi rend="italic subscript"> b <,hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a <,hi> , the ratio of isothermal expansion, is equal to V <hi rend="italic subscript"> c <,hi> ∕V <hi rend="italic subscript"> a <,hi> , the ratio of isothermal compression. For brevity we shall denote either of these last ratios by <hi rend="italic">r. <,hi> <,p>  4I. The following are the transfers of heat to and from the working fluid, in successive stages of the cycle :— <,p>  (I) Heat taken in from A = <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> (by § 39). <,p>  (2) No heat taken in or rejected. <,p>  (3) Heat rejected to C= <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> (by § 39). <,p>  (4) No heat taken in or rejected. <,p>  Hence, by the first law of thermodynamics, the net external work done by the gas is <,p>  <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> (τ-τ) log <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> ; <,p>  and the efficiency of the engine (§ 23) is <,p>  cHl ~ T)°ge <hi rend="superscript"> r τ <,hi> l ~ <hi rend="superscript"> τ <,hi> 2 <,p>  cτlog <hi rend="subscript"> e <,hi> r <hi rend="superscript"> - <,hi> τ <,p>  This is the fraction of the whole heat given to it which an engine following Carnot’s cycle converts into work. The engine takes in an amount of heat, at the temperature of the source, proportional to τ; it rejects an amount of heat, at the temperature of the receiver, proportional to τ. It works within a range of temperature extending from τto τ, by letting down heat from τto τ(§ 24), and in the process it converts into work a fraction of that heat, which fraction will be greater the lower the temperature τat which heat is rejected is below the temperature τat which heat is received. <,p>  42. Next let us consider what will happen if we reverse Carnot’s cycle, that is to say, if we force this engine to act so that the same indicator diagram as before is traced out, but in the direction opposite to that followed in § 4O. Starting as before from the point <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> and with the gas at τ, we shall require the following four operations :— <,p>  (I) Apply B and allow the piston to rise. The gas expands adiabatically, the curve traced is <hi rend="italic">ad, <,hi> and when <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> is reached the temperature has fallen to τ. <,p>  (2) Remove B and apply C. Allow the piston to go on rising. The gas expands isothermally at τ, taking heat from C, and the curve <hi rend="italic">dc <,hi> is traced. <,p>  (3) Remove C and apply B. Compress the gas. The process is adiabatic. The curve traced is <hi rend="italic">cb, <,hi> and when <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> is reached the temperature has risen to τ <hi rend="subscript"> l <,hi> . <,p>  (4) Remove B and apply A. Continue the compression, which is now isothermal, at τ. Heat is now rejected to A, and the cycle is completed by the curve <hi rend="italic">ba. <,hi> <,p>  In this process the engine is not doing work ; on the contrary, work is spent upon it equal to the area of the diagram, or <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> (τ— τ) log <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> . Heat is taken in from C in the first operation, to the amount <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> . Heat is rejected to A in the fourth operation, to the amount <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> . In the first and third operations there is no transfer of heat. <,p>  The action is now in every respect the reverse of what it was before. The same work is now spent upon the engine as was formerly done by it. The same amount of heat is now given to the hot body A as was formerly taken from it. The same amount of heat is now taken from the cold body C as was formerly given to it, as will be seen by the following scheme :— <,p>  <hi rend="italic">Carnot's Cycle, Direct. <,hi> <,p>  Work done by the engine = <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> (τ- τ) log <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> ; <,p>  Heat taken from A = <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> ; <,p>  Heat rejected to C= <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> . <,p>  <hi rend="italic">Carnot’s Cycle, Reversed. <,hi> <,p>  Work spent upon the engine= <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> (τ- τ) log <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> ; <,p>  Heat rejected to A = <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> ; <,p>  Heat taken from C = <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> . <,p>  The reversal of the work has been accompanied by an exact reversal of each of the transfers of heat. <,p>  43. An engine in which this is possible is called, from the thermodynamic point of view, a <hi rend="italic">reversible <,hi> engine. In other words, a reversible heat-engine is one which, if forced to trace out its indicator diagram reversed in direction, so that the work which would be done by the engine, when running direct, is actually spent upon it, will reject to the source of heat the same quantity of heat as, when running direct, it would take from the source, and will take from the receiver of heat the same quantity as, when running direct, it would reject to the receiver. By “the source of heat” is meant the hot body which acts as source, and by “ the receiver ” is meant the cold body which acts as receiver, when the <,p</label>>

Carnot’s engine is one example of a reversible engine. The idea of thermodynamic reversibility is highly important, for the reason that no heat-engine can be more efficient than a reversible engine, if both take in and reject heat at the same pair of temperatures. <,p>  44. To prove this, let it be supposed that we have two engines M and N, of which N is reversible in the above sense, and that we have a hot body A capable of acting as a source of heat, and a cold body C capable of acting as a receiver of heat. The engine M is set to work as a heat-engine, taking heat from A and rejecting heat to C. To prove that M cannot be more efficient than the reversible engine N, we shall assume that it <hi rend="italic">is <,hi> more efficient, and trace the consequences of that assumption. <,p>  Let M, working direct, be coupled so as to work N reversed ; if we suppose that the engines are without mechanical friction, and can be coupled up without loss of power, the work represented by the indicator diagram of M is spent on N, and N will therefore reject to A an amount of heat which we will call <hi rend="smallcaps">Qa <,hi> and take from B an amount of heat which we will call <hi rend="smallcaps">Qb. Now, <,hi> since N is reversible, if it worked direct, taking <hi rend="smallcaps">Qa <,hi> from A, it would do the same amount of work as, in the supposed circumstances, is spent upon it. Hence, if M is more efficient than N it is taking from A an amount of heat <hi rend="italic">less <,hi> than <hi rend="smallcaps">Qa, <,hi> and consequently also is giving to B an amount of heat correspondingly less than Q <hi rend="smallcaps">b <,hi> . The joint effect, therefore, of M working direct and N working reversed is that the heat taken from A by M is less than the heat given to A by N, while the heat given to B by M is less (to an equal extent) than the heat taken from B by N. The consequence is that the hot body A is gaining heat on the whole, and the cold body B is losing an equal amount of heat ; in other words, with the continued action of the double system heat passes, in indefinitely large quantity, from a cold body to a hot body, by means of an agency which, it is to be observed, is purely self-acting, for if we suppose there is no mechanical friction the system requires no help from without. Now this result is, by the second law of thermodynamics (§ 23), contrary to all experience ; and we are forced to conclude that the assumption that M is more efficient than the reversible engine N, when both take in and reject heat at the same two temperatures, is false. Hence, with given temperatures of source and receiver of heat no engine is more efficient than a reversible engine. <,p>  Next, let M and N both be reversible and both work between the same limits, but be different in any other respect. Then by the foregoing argument M cannot be more efficient than N, neither can N be more efficient than M. Hence all reversible heat- engines taking in and rejecting heat at the same temperatures are equally efficient. <,p>  45. These results imply that reversibility, in the thermodynamic sense, is the criterion of what may be called perfection in a heat- engine. A reversible engine is perfect in the sense that it cannot be improved on as regards efficiency : no other engine, taking in and rejecting heat at the same temperatures, will convert into work a greater fraction of the heat which it takes in. Moreover, if this criterion be satisfied, it is as regards efficiency a matter of complete indifference what is the nature of the working substance, or what, in other respects, is the mode of the engine’s action. <,p>  46. Further, since all engines that arc reversible are equally efficient, provided they work between the same temperatures, an expression for the efficiency of one will apply equally to all. Now, the engine whose efficiency we have found in § 4I is one example of a reversible engine. Hence its efficiency <,p>  (τ-τ)∕τ <,p>  is the efficiency of any reversible heat-engine whatsoever taking in heat at τand rejecting heat at τ. And, as no engine can be more efficient than one that is reversible, this expression is the measure of <hi rend="italic">perfect efficiency. <,hi> We have thus arrived at the immensely important conclusion that no heat-engine can convert into work a greater fraction of the heat which it receives than is expressed by the excess of the temperature of reception above that of rejection divided by the absolute temperature of reception. <,p>  47. Briefly recapitulated, the steps of the argument by which this result has been reached are as follows. After stating the experimental laws to which gases conform, we examined the action of a heat-engine in which the working substance took in heat when at the temperature of the source and rejected heat when at the temperature of the receiver, the change of temperature from one to the other of these limits being accomplished by adiabatic expansion and adiabatic compression. Taking a special case in which this engine had for its working substance a perfect gas, we found that its efficiency was (τ-τ)∕ τ(§ 4I). We also observed that it was, in the thermodynamic sense, a reversible engine (§ 43). Then we found, by an application of the second law of thermodynamics, that no heat-engine can have a higher efficiency than a reversible engine, when taking in and giving out heat at the same two temperatures τand τ; this was shown by the fact that a contrary assumption leads to a violation of the second law (§ 44). Hence, we concluded that all reversible heat- engines receiving and rejecting heat at the same temperatures τ <,p>  and τrespectively are equally efficient, and hence that the efficiency (τ- τ) ∕τ, already determined for one particular reversible engine, measures the efficiency of any reversible engine, and is a limit of efficiency which no engine whatever can exceed. <,p>  48. Tho second law of thermodynamics, on which (along with the first law) this conclusion rests has been given in many different forms. The statement of it in § 23 is that of Clausius, and is very similar to that of Sir W. Thomson. Rankine, to whom with Thomson and Clausius is due the development of the theory of heat- engines from the point at which Carnot left it, has stated the second law in a form which is neither easy to understand, nor obvious, as an experimental result, when understood. His statement runs :— <,p>  “ If the absolute temperature of any uniformly hot substance he divided into any number of equal parts, the effects of those parts in causing work to be performed are equal.”<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="6"> <hi rend="italic">Manual of the Steam Engine and other prime Movers, <,hi> § 243. <,note> <,p>  To make this intelligible we may suppose that any quantity <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> of heat from a source at temperature τis taken by the first of a series of perfect heat-engines, and that this engine rejects heat at a temperature τless than τby a certain interval ∆τ. Let the heat so rejected by the first engine form the heat supply of a second perfect engine working from τto τthrough an equal interval ∆τ ; let the heat which it in turn rejects form the heat-supply of a third perfect engine working again through an equal interval from τto τ; and so on. The efficiencies of the several engines are (by § 46) — , — , — , &amp;amp;c. The amounts of heat supplied to <hi rend="superscript"> τ <,hi> ι <hi rend="superscript"> τ <,hi> a <hi rend="superscript"> τ <,hi> 3 <,p>  them are <hi rend="italic">q , q <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> τ <,hi> <hi rend="italic">⅛ , q <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> π <,hi> <hi rend="italic">⅛ , <,hi> &amp;amp;c. Hence the amount of work done by <hi rend="italic superscript"> τ <,hi> <hi rend="italic">l <,hi> <,p>  each engine is the same, namely, 7— . Thus Rankine’s statement <,p>  is to be understood as meaning that each of the equal intervals into which any range of temperature may be divided is equally effective in allowing work to be produced from heat when heat is made to pass, doing work in the most efficient possible way, through all the intervals from the top to the bottom of the range. <,p>  49. A point of much theoretical interest may be noted in passing. In place of measuring temperature, as we have done, by the expansion of a perfect gas, a scale of temperature might be formed thus. Starting from any one temperature, let a series of intervals be taken such that a series of reversible engines, each working with one of the intervals for its range, in the manner described in § 48 (so that the heat rejected by the first forms the supply of the second, and so on), will each do the same amount of work ; then <hi rend="italic">call these intervals equal. <,hi> This gives a scale of temperature (originally suggested by Sir W. Thomson) which is truly absolute in the sense of being independent of the properties of any substance ; it coincides, as is evident from § 48, with the scale we have been using, in which equal intervals of temperature are defined as those corresponding to equal amounts of expansion of a perfect gas under constant pressure ; and it coincides approximately with the scale of a mercury thermometer when that is graduated to read from the absolute zero by the addition of a suitable constant (§ 29). <,p>  5O. The availability of heat for transformation into work depends essentially on the range of temperature through which the heat is let down from the hot source to the cold body into which heat is rejected ; it is only in virtue of a difference of temperature between bodies that conversion of any part of their heat into work becomes possible. If τand τare the highest and lowest temperatures of the range through which a heat-engine works, it is clear that the maximum of efficiency can be reached only when the engine takes in all its heat at τand rejects at τall that is rejected. With respect to every portion of heat taken in and rejected the greatest ideal efficiency is <,p>  _ Temperature of reception - temperature of rejection Temperature of reception <,p>  Any heat taken in at a temperature below τor rejected at a temperature above τwill have less availability for conversion into work than if taken in at τand rejected at τ, and hence, with a given pair of limiting temperatures, it is essential to maximum efficiency that uo heat be taken in by the engine except at the top of the range, and no heat rejected except at the bottom of the range. Further, as we have seen in § 45, when the temperatures at which heat is received and rejected are assigned, an engine attains the maximum of efficiency if it be reversible, <,p>  5I. It is therefore important to inquire more particularly what kinds of action are reversible in the thermodynamic sense. A little consideration will show that a transfer of heat from the source or to the receiver is reversible only when the working substance is at sensibly the same temperature as the source or the receiver, as the case may be, and an expansion is reversible only when it occurs by the gradual displacement of some part of the containing envelope in such a manner that the expanding fluid does external work on the envelope, and does not waste energy to any sensible extent in setting itself in motion. This excludes what may be termed free expansion, <,p</label>>

If these conditions are fulfilled the engine is a perfect heat-engine. <,p>  The first and second of these conditions are satisfied if in the action of the engine the working substance changes its temperature from τto τby adiabatic expansion, and from τto τby adiabatic compression, thereby being enabled to take in and reject heat at the ends of the range without taking in or rejecting any by the way. This is the action in Carnot's engine (§ 4O). <,p>  52. But if we can cause the working substance to deposit heat in some body within the engine while passing from τto τ, in such a manner that the transfer of heat from the substance to this body is reversible (satisfying the second condition above), then when we wish the working substance to pass from τto τwe may reverse this transfer and so recover the heat that was deposited in this body. This alternate storing and restoring of heat may then take the place of adiabatic expansion and compression, in causing the temperature of the working substance to pass from τto τand from τto τrespectively. The alternate storing and restoring is an action occurring wholly within the engine, and is therefore distinct from the taking in and rejecting of heat by the engine. <,p>  53. In I827 Robert Stirling designed an apparatus, called a <hi rend="italic">regenerator, <,hi> by which this process of alternate storing and restoring of heat could be actually performed. For the present purpose it will suffice to describe the regenerator as a passage through which the working fluid can travel in either direction, whose walls have a very large capacity for heat, so that the amount alternately given to or taken from them by the working fluid causes no more than an insensible rise or fall in their temperature. The temperature of the walls at one end of the passage is τ, and this tapers continuously down to τat the other end. When the working fluid at temperature τenters the hot end and passes through, it comes out at the cold end at temperature τ, having stored in tho walls of the regenerator an amount of heat which it will pick up again when passed through in the opposite direction. During the return journey its temperature rises from τto τ. The process is strictly reversible, or rather would be so if the regenerator had an unlimited capacity for heat, if no conduction of heat took place along its walls from the hot to the cold end, and if no loss took place by conduction or radiation from its external surface. <,p>  54. Using air as the working substance, and employing his regenerator, Stirling made an engine (to be described later) which, allowing for practical imperfections, is the earliest example of a truly reversible engine. The cycle of operations in Stirling’s engine is substantially this :— <,p>  (I) Air (which has been heated to τby passing through the regenerator) is allowed to expand isothermally through a ratio <hi rend="italic">r, <,hi> taking in heat from a furnace and raising a piston. Heat taken in (per lb of air) = <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> . <,p>  (2) The air is caused to pass through the regenerator from the hot to the cold end, depositing heat and having its temperature lowered to τ, without change of volume. Heat stored in regenerator = K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p <,hi> (τ- τ). The pressure of course falls. <,p>  (3) The air is then compressed isothermally to its original volume at τin contact with a refrigerator (or receiver of heat). Heat rejected = <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> τlog <hi rend="subscript"> ε <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> . <,p>  (4) The air is again passed through the regenerator from the cold to the hot end, taking up heat and having its temperature raised to τ.

I3, and a diagram of the engine is given in chap. XIV. Stirling’s engine is important, not as a present-day heat-engine (though it has recently been revived in small forms after a long interval of disuse), but because it is typical of the only mode, other than Carnot’s plan of adiabatic expansion and compression, by which the action of a heat-engine can be made reversible. Valuable as the regenerator has proved in metallurgy and other industrial processes, its actual application to heat-engines has hitherto been very limited. An <,p>  other way of using it in air-engines was designed by Ericsson, and attempts have been made by C. W. Siemens and F. Jenkin to apply it to steam-engines and to gas-engines. But almost all actual engines, in so far as they can be said to approach the condition of reversibility, do so, not by the use of the regenerative principle, but by more or less nearly adiabatic expansion and compression after the manner of Carnot’s ideal engine. <,p>  III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Properties of Steam and Theory of the Steam-Engine. <,hi> <,p>  55. We have now to consider the action of heat-engines in which the working substance is water and water-vapour or steam. The properties of steam are most conveniently stated by referring in the first instance to what happens when steam is formed <hi rend="italic">under constant pressure. <,hi> This is substantially the process which occurs in the boiler of a steam-engine when the engine is at work. To fix the ideas we may suppose that the vessel in which steam is to be formed is a long upright cylinder fitted with a piston which may be loaded so that it exerts a constant pressure on the fluid below. Let there be, to begin with, at the foot of the cylinder a quantity of water (which for convenience of numerical statement we shall take as I lb), at any temperature <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> ; and let the piston press on the surface of the water with a force of P lb per square foot. Let heat now be applied to the bottom of the cylinder. As it enters the water it will produce the following effects in three stages :— <,p>  (I) The temperature of the water rises until a certain temperature <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> is reached, at which steam begins to be formed. The value of <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> depends on the particular pressure P which the piston exerts. Until the temperature <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> is reached there is nothing but water below the piston. <,p>  (2) Steam is formed, more heat being taken in. The piston (which is supposed to exert a constant pressure) rises. No further increase of temperature occurs during this stage, which continues until all the water is converted into steam. During this stage the steam which is formed is said to be <hi rend="italic">saturated. <,hi> The volume which the piston encloses at the end of this stage,— the volume, namely, of I lb of saturated steam at pressure P (and temperature <hi rend="italic">t),— <,hi> will be denoted by V in cubic feet. <,p>  (3) If after all the water is converted into steam more heat be allowed to enter, the volume will increase and the temperature will rise. The steam is then said to be <hi rend="italic">superheated. <,hi> <,p>  56. The difference between saturated and superheated steam may be expressed by saying that if water (at the temperature of the steam) be mixed with steam some of the water will be evaporated if the steam is superheated, but none if the steam is saturated. Any vapour in contact with its liquid and in thermal equilibrium is necessarily saturated. When saturated its properties differ considerably, as a rule, from those of a perfect gas, but when superheated they approach those of a perfect gas more and more closely the farther the process of superheating is carried, that is to say, the more the temperature is raised above <hi rend="italic">t, <,hi> the temperature of saturation corresponding to the given pressure P. <,p>  57. The temperature <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> at which steam is formed depends on the value of P. Their relation was determined with great care by Regnault, in a series of classical experiments on which our knowledge of the properties of steam chiefly depends.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="7"> <hi rend="italic">Hem. Inst. France, <,hi> I847, vol. xxi. An account of Regnault’s methods of experiment and a statement of his results expressed in British measures will be found in Dixon’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Heat. . <,hi> <,note> The pressure of saturated steam rises with the temperature at a rate which increases rapidly in the upper regions of the scale. This will be apparent from the first and second columns of Table II., given on next page, which is compiled from Rankine’s reduction of Regnault’s results. The first column gives the temperature on the Fahr. scale; the second gives the corresponding pressure in pounds per square inch. Rankine has also expressed the relation of temperature and pressure in saturated steam by the following formula (which is applicable with other constants to other vapours<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="7"> <hi rend="italic">Phil. Mag., <,hi> Dec.

For most purposes, however, it is more convenient to find the pressure corresponding to a given temperature, or the temperature corresponding to a given pressure, from the table by interpolation. <,p>  58. The same table shows the volume V, in cubic feet, occupied by I lb of saturated steam at each pressure. This is a quantity the direct experimental measurement of which is of very great difficulty. It may, however, be calculated, from a knowledge of other properties of steam, by a process which will be described later (§ 75). The values of V given in the table were determined by Rankine by means of this process; they agree fairly well with such direct observations of the density of steam as have been hitherto <,p</label>>

Since the specific heat of water is nearly constant, the amount of heat taken in during the first stage is approximately <hi rend="italic">t-t <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> O <,hi> thermal units or J(<hi rend="italic">t <,hi> - <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> ) foot-pounds, J being Joule’s equivalent (§ 23), and this expression for it will generally serve with sufficient accuracy in practical calculations. More exactly, however, the heat taken in is somewhat greater than this, for Regnault's experiments show that the specific heat of water increases slightly as the temperature rises. In stating the amount of heat required for this first stage, <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> O <,hi> must be taken as a known temperature; for convenience in numerical statement the temperature 32° F. is usually chosen as an arbitrary starting-point from which the reception of heat is to be reckoned. We shall employ the symbol <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> to designate the heat required to raise I lb of water from 32° F. to the temperature <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> at which steam begins to form. The value of <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> in thermal units is given, approximately, by the equation <,p>  <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> = <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> -32. <,p>  More exact values, which take account of the variation in the specific heat of water, will be found in the last column of Table II. During the first stage, sensibly all the heat supplied goes to increase the stock of internal energy which the fluid possesses, the amount of external work which is done by the expansion of the fluid being negligible. <,p>  6O. The heat taken in during the second stage is what is called the <hi rend="italic">latent heat <,hi> of steam, and is denoted by L. Of it a part is spent <,p>  in doing external work,—namely, P multiplied by the excess of the volume of the steam over the volume of the water,—and the remainder is the difference of internal energy between I lb of steam at <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> and I lb of water at <hi rend="italic">t. <,hi> The volume of I lb of water, at such temperatures as are usual in steam-engines, is nearly O∙OI7 cubic feet. We may therefore write the external work (in foot-pounds) done during the production of I lb of steam under constant pressure P,— <,p>  External work = P(V-O∙OI7). <,p>  6I. Adding together the heat taken in during the first and second stages we have a quantity designated by H and called the <hi rend="italic">total heat <,hi> of I lb of saturated steam:— <,p>  H= <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> + L. <,p>  Regnault’s values of H are very accurately expressed (in thermal units) by the formula <,p>  H = IO82 + O∙3O5 <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> . <,p>  They are given in the fourth column of Table II. A similar formula gives approximate values of L, exact enough for use in practical calculations,— <,p>  L=III4-O∙7 <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> . <,p>  The total heat of formation of I lb of steam, when formed under constant pressure from water at any temperature <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> , is of course H - <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> O <,hi> <hi rend="italic">, <,hi> where <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> O <,hi> corresponds to <hi rend="italic">t <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> O <,hi> <hi rend="italic">, <,hi> <,p>  62. Of the whole latent heat of steam, L, the part Γ(V -O∙OI7) is, as has been said above, spent in doing external work. The remainder (in foot-pounds)— <,p>  JL-P(V-O∙Ol7)— <,p>  is the change of internal energy which the substance undergoes during evaporation. This quantity, for which it is convenient to have a separate symbol, will be denoted by <hi rend="italic">ρ <,hi> in thermal units, or J <hi rend="italic">ρ <,hi> in foot-pounds. In dealing with the heat required to produce steam we adopted the state of water at 32° F. as an arbitrary starting-point from which to reckon the reception of heat. In the same way it is convenient to use this arbitrary starting-point in reckoning what may be called the <hi rend="italic">internal energy <,hi> of the substance, which is the excess of the heat taken in over the external work done by the substance during its reception of heat. Thus the internal energy I of I lb of saturated steam at pressure P is equal to the total heat H, less that part of the total heat which is spent in doing external work, or (in foot-pounds) <,p>  JI = JH-P(V-O∙OI7), <,p>  or I = L + <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> - P(V-O∙OI7)∕J = <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> + <hi rend="italic">ρ <,hi> . <,p>  The notion of internal energy is useful in calculating the heat taken in or rejected by steam during any stage of its expansion or compression in an engine. When a working substance passes from one condition to another, its gain or loss of heat is determined by the equation <,p>  Heat taken in = increase of internal energy + external work. <,p>  Any of the terms of this equation may be negative ; the last term is negative when work is done, not by, but upon the substance. <,p>  63. The same equation gives the means of finding the amount of heat required to form steam under any assigned conditions, in place of the condition assumed at the beginning of this chapter, where the formation of steam under constant pressure was considered. Whatever be the condition as to pressure under which the process of formation is carried on, the total heat required is the sum of the internal energy of the steam when formed and the work done by the substance during the process. Thus in general <,p>  Heat of formation = I + J <hi rend="superscript"> -I <,hi> ∫P <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> V, the limits of integration being the final volume of the steam and the original volume of the water. When steam is formed in a closed vessel of constant volume no external work is done ; the heat of formation is then equal to the internal energy, and is less than the total heat of formation (H) of steam, when formed at a constant pressure equal to the pressure reached in the vessel, by the quantity P(V-O·OI7). <,p>  64. In calculations which relate to the action of steam in engines we have generally to deal, not with <hi rend="italic">dry <,hi> saturated steam, but with <hi rend="italic">wet <,hi> steam, or steam whieh either carries in suspension, or is otherwise mixed with, a greater or less proportion of water. In every such mixture the steam and water have the same temperature, and the steam is saturated. The dryness of wet steam is measured by the proportion <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> of dry steam in each pound of the mixed substance. When that is known it is easy to determine the other physical constants : thus— <,p>  Latent heat of I lb of wet steam <hi rend="italic">= qL ; <,hi> <,p>  Total heat of I lb of wet steam <hi rend="italic">=h + q <,hi> L <hi rend="italic">∙, <,hi> <,p>  Volume of I lb of wet steam = <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> V + (I - <hi rend="italic">q) <,hi> O·OI7 <,p>  = <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> V very nearly, <,p>  unless the steam is so wet as to consist mainly of water ; Internal energy of I lb of wet steam <hi rend="italic">=h+qρ. <,hi> <,p>  65. Steam is superheated when its temperature is raised, in any manner, above the temperature corresponding to saturation at the actual pressure. When much superheated, steam behaves like a <,p</label>>

At very low temperatures steam approximates closely to the condition of a perfect gas when very slightly superheated, and even when saturated ; at high temperatures a much greater amount of superheating is necessary to bring about an approach to the perfectly gaseous state. The total heat required for the production of superheated steam under any constant pressure, when the superheating is sufficient to bring the steam to the state of steam gas, may therefore be reckoned by taking the total heat of saturated steam at a low temperature and adding to it the product of K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p <,hi> , into the excess of temperature above that. Thus Rankine, treating saturated steam at 32° F. as a gas, gives the formula <,p>  H'=IO92 + O∙48(<hi rend="italic">t <,hi> '-32) <,p>  to express the heat of formation (under any constant pressure) of superheated steam, at any temperature <hi rend="italic">t' <,hi> which is so much above the temperature of saturation corresponding to the actual pressure that the steam may be treated as a perfect gas. Calculated from its chemical composition, the density of steam gas should be O·622 times that of air at the same pressure and temperature. The value of γ or K <hi rend="italic subscript"> p <,hi> ∕K <hi rend="italic subscript"> v <,hi> for steam gas is I·3. These formulas, dealing as they do with steam which is so highly superheated as to be perfectly gaseous, fail to apply to high-pressure steam that is heated but little above its temperature of saturation. The relation of pressure to volume and temperature in the region which lies between the saturated and the perfectly gaseous states has been experimented on by Hirn.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="9"> <hi rend="italic">Théorie Mécanique de la Chaleur. <,hi> <,note> Formulas which are applicable with more or less accuracy to steam in either the saturated or superheated condition have been devised by Hirn, Zeuner,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="9"> <hi rend="italic">Ztschr. d.

The expansion of volume which occurs during the conversion of water into steam under constant pressure—the second stage of the process described in § 55—is isothermal. From what has been already said it is obvious that steam, or any other saturated vapour, can be expanded or compressed isothermally only when wet, and that evaporation (in the one case) or condensation (in the other) must accompany the process. Isothermal lines for a working substance which consists of a liquid and its vapour are straight lines of uniform pressure. <,p>  67. The form of adiabatic lines for substances of the same class depends not only on the particular fluid, but also· on the proportion of liquid to vapour in the mixture. In the case of steam, it has been shown by Rankine and Clausius that if steam initially dry be allowed to expand adiabatically it becomes wet, and if initially wet (unless very wet<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="9"> Prof. Cotterill, in his <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Steam-Engine, <,hi> § 79, has calculated (using the equation which follows in the text) that, when a mixture of steam and water expands adiabatically, steam condenses if the proportion of steam be, roughly, over 5O per cent., but water is evaporated if the proportion of steam be less than about 5O per cent. The exact proportion depends on the initial pressure. <,note> ) it becomes wetter. A part of the steam is condensed by the process of adiabatic expansion, at first in the form of minute particles suspended throughout the mass. The temperature and pressure fall ; and, as that part of the substance which remains uncondensed is saturated, the relation of pressure to temperature throughout the expansion is that which holds for saturated steam. The following formula, proved by Rankine<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="9"> <hi rend="italic">Steam-Engine, <,hi> § 28I. <,note> and Clausius<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="9"> <hi rend="italic">Mechanical Theory of Heat <,hi> (tr. by W. R. Browne), chap. vi. J I2. <,note> (see § 75), serves to calculate the extent to which condensation takes place during adiabatic expansion, and so allows the relation of pressure to volume to be determined. <,p>  Before expansion, let the initial dryness of the steam be <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> and its absolute temperature τ.

He determined it by examining the expansion curves of indicator diagrams taken from working steam- engines ; but, as we shall see later, the expansion of steam in an actual engine is by no means adiabatic, on account of the transfer of heat which goes on between the working fluid and the metal of the cylinder and piston. When it is desired to draw an adiabatic curve for steam, that value of <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> must be chosen which refers to the degree of dryness at the beginning of the expansion. <,p>  68. We are now in a position to study the action of a heat-engine employing steam as the working substance. To simplify the first consideration as far as possible, let it be supposed that we have, as before, a long cylinder composed of non-conducting material except at the base, and fitted with a non-conducting piston ; also a source of heat A at some temperature τ; a receiver of heat, or, as we may now call it, a condenser C, at a lower temperature τ; and a non-conducting cover B (as in § 4O). Then we can perform Carnot’s cycle of operations as follows. To fix the ideas, suppose that there is I lb of water in the cylinder to begin with, at the temperature τ:— <,p>  (I) Apply A, and allow the piston to rise. The water will take in heat and be converted into steam, expanding isothermally at constant pressure P. This part of the operation <,p>  is shown by the line <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> in fig. I4. <,p>  (2) Remove A and apply B. Allow the expan <,p>  sion to continue adiabatically (<hi rend="italic">bc <,hi> ) <hi rend="italic">, <,hi> with falling pressure, until the temperature falls to τ. The pressure will then be P. corresponding (in Table II.) to τ. <,p>  (3) Remove B, apply C, and compress. Steam is condensed by rejecting heat to C. The action is isothermal, and the pressure remains P. Let this be continued until a certain point <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> is reached, after which adiabatic compression will complete the cycle. <,p>  (4) Remove C and apply B. Continue the compression, which is now adiabatic. If the point <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> has been rightly chosen, this will complete the cycle by restoring the working fluid to the state of water at temperature τ. <,p>  The indicator diagram for the cycle is given in fig. I4, as calculated by the help of the equations in § 67 and of Table II. for a particular example, in which <hi rend="italic">p <,hi> = 9O lb per square inch (τ= 78I), and the expansion is continued down to the pressure of the atmosphere, I47 lb per square inch (τ=673). Since the process is reversible, and since heat is taken in only at τand rejected only at τ, the efficiency is (τ- τ)∕τ, The heat taken in per lb of the fluid is L, and the work done is L(τ-τ)∕τ, a result which may be used to check the calculation of the diagram. <,p>  69. If the action here described could be realized in practice, we should have a thermodynamically perfect steam-engine using saturated steam. The fraction of the heat supplied to it which such an engine would convert into work would depend simply on the temperature, and therefore on the pressure, at which the steam was produced and condensed. The temperature of condensation is limited by the consideration that there must be an abundant supply of some substance to absorb the rejected heat ; water is actually used for this purpose, so that τhas for its lower limit the temperature of the available water-supply. <,p>  To the higher temperature τand pressure Pno limit can be set except such as is brought about in practice by the mechanical difficulties, with regard to strength and to lubrication, which attend the use of high-pressure steam. By a very special construction of engine and boiler Mr Perkins has been able to use steam with a pressure as high as 5OO lb per square inch ; with engines of the usual construction the value ranges from I9O lb downwards. <,p>  If the temperature of condensation be taken as 6O° F., as a lower limit, the efficiency of a perfect steam-engine, using saturated steam, would depend on the value of P, the absolute pressure of production of the steam, as follows :— <,p>  For perfect steam-engine, with condensation at 6O° F., <,p>  Pin lb per square inch being 4O 8O I2O I6O 2OO <,p>  Highest ideal efficiency = ·284 ·326 ·35O ·368 ·38I <,p>  But it must not be supposed that these values of the efficiency are actually attained, or are even attainable. Many causes conspire to prevent steam-engines from being thermodynamically perfect, and some of the causes of imperfection cannot be removed. These numbers will serve, however, as a standard of comparison in judging of <,p</label>>

As a contrast to the ideally perfect steam-engine of § 68 we may next consider a cyclic action such as occurred in the early engines of Newcomen or Leupold, when steam was used non- expansively,—or rather, such an action as would have occurred in engines of this type had the cylinder been a perfect non-conductor of neat. Let the cycle of operations be this : — <,p>  (I) Apply A and evaporate the water as before at P. Heat taken in = L. <,p>  (2) Remove A and apply C. This at once condenses a part of the steam, and reduces the pressure to P. <,p>  (3) Compress at P, in contact with C, till condensation is complete, and water at τis left. <,p>  (4) Remove B and apply A. This heats the water again to τand completes the cycle. <,p>  Heat taken in= <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> - <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> . <,p>  The indicator diagram for this series of operations is shown in fig. I5. <,p>  Here the action is not reversible. To calculate the efficiency, we have <hi rend="underline">Work done <,hi> <hi rend="subscript"> = <,hi> <hi rend="underline">(P <,hi> <hi rend="subscript underline"> I <,hi> <hi rend="underline">- P <,hi> <hi rend="subscript underline"> 2 <,hi> <hi rend="underline">)(V <,hi> <hi rend="subscript underline"> I <,hi> <hi rend="underline">- Q∙QI7) <,hi> <,p>  Heat taken in J(L+ Λ-∕⅛) <,p>  The values of this will be found to range from O·O67 to O·O72 for the values of Pwhich are stated in § 69, when the temperature of condensation is 6O° F. <,p>  7I. In the ideal engine represented in fig. I4 the functions of boiler, cylinder, and condenser are combined in a single vessel ; but after what has been said in chap. II. it is scarcely necessary to remark that, provided the working substance passes through the same cycle of operations, it is indifferent whether these are performed in several vessels or in one. To approach a little more closely the conditions that hold in practice, we may think of the engine which performs the cycle of § 7O as consisting of a boiler A (fig. I6) kept at τ, a non-conducting cylin <,p>  der and piston B, a surface con <,p>  denser C kept at τ, and a feed-pump <,p>  D which restores the condensed <,p>  water to the boiler. Then for every <,p>  pound of steam supplied and used <,p>  non-expansively as in § 7O, we have <,p>  work done on the piston =(P- P) V; <,p>  but an amount of work has to be ex <,p>  pended in driving the feed- <,p>  pump =(P-P) O·OI7. <,p>  Deducting this, the net <,p>  work done per lb of steam <,p>  is the same as before, and <,p>  the heat taken in is also <,p>  the same. An indicator diagram taken from the cylinder would give the area <hi rend="italic">efgh <,hi> (fig. I7), where <hi rend="italic">oe <,hi> = P, <hi rend="italic">ef <,hi> = V, <hi rend="italic">oh <,hi> = P; an indicator diagram taken from the pump would <,p>  give the negative area <hi rend="italic">hjie, <,hi> where <hi rend="italic">ei <,hi> is the <,p>  volume of the feed-water, or O·OI7 cub. ft. <,p>  The difference, namely, the shaded area, is <,p>  the diagram of the complete cycle gone <,p>  through by each pound of the working <,p>  substance. In experimental measurements <,p>  of the work done in steam-engines, only <,p>  the action whieh occurs within the cylinder is shown on the indicator diagram. From this the work spent on the feed-pump is to be subtracted in any accurate determination of the thermodynamic efficiency. If the feed-water is at any temperature τother than that of the condenser as assumed in § 7O, it is clear that the heat taken in is H- <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> instead of H- <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> <hi rend="italic">. <,hi> <,p>  72. We have now to inquire how nearly, with the engine of fig. I6 (that is to say, with an engine in which the boiler and condenser are separate from the cylinder), we can approach the reversible cycle of § 68. The first stage of that cycle corresponds to the <hi rend="italic">admission <,hi> of steam from the boiler into the cylinder. Then the ]∣oint known as the point of <hi rend="italic">cut-off <,hi> is reached, at which admission ceases, and the steam already in the cylinder is allowed to expand, exerting a diminishing pressure on the piston. This is the second stage, or the stage of <hi rend="italic">expansion. <,hi> The process of expansion may be carried on until the pressure falls to that of the condenser, in which case the expansion is said to be complete. At the end of the expansion <hi rend="italic">release <,hi> takes place, that is to say, communication is opened with the condenser. Then the return stroke begins, and a period termed the <hi rend="italic">exhaust <,hi> occurs, that is to say, steam passes out of the cylinder, into the condenser, where it is condensed at pressure P, which is felt as a <hi rend="italic">back pressure <,hi> opposing the return of the piston. So far, all has been essentially reversible, and identical with the corresponding parts of Carnot’s cycle. <,p>  But we cannot complete the cycle as Carnot's cycle was completed. The existence of a separate condenser makes the fourth stage, that of adiabatic compression, impracticable, and the best we can do is to continue the exhaust until condensation is com <,p>  plete, and then return the condensed water to the boiler by means of the feed-pump. <,p>  It is true that we may, and in actual practice do, stop the exhaust before the return stroke is complete, and compress that portion of the steam which remains below the piston, but this does not materially affect the thermodynamic efficiency ; it is done partly for mechanical reasons, and partly to avoid loss of power through clearance (see chap. IV. ). In the present instance it is supposed that there is no clearance, in which case this compression is out of the question. The indicator diagram given by a cylinder in which steam goes through the action described above is shown to scale in fig. I8 for a particular example, in which it is supposed that I cubic foot of dry saturated steam is admitted at an absolute pressure of 9O lb per square inch, and is expanded twelve times, or down to a pressure of 5·4 lb per square inch, at which pressure it is discharged to the condenser. <,p>  As we have assumed the cylinder to be non-conducting, and the steam to be initially dry, the expansion follows the law PV <hi rend="superscript"> I·I35 <,hi> = constant. The advantage of expansion is obvious, that part of the diagram which lies under the curve being so much clear gain. <,p>  73. To calculate the efficiency, we have Work done per lb during admission = PV; <,p>  P V - P. rV <,p>  ,, ,, during expansion to volume rV=- <hi rend="superscript"> i <,hi> -^ <hi rend="subscript"> ι <,hi> ~ — -, <,p>  (by § 36), = (PV- P <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> V)∕O I35 ; <,p>  Work spent during return stroke = P <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> V; <,p>  ,, „ on the feed-pump = (P- P)O·OI7 ; <,p>  Heat taken in = H- <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> . <,p>  74. These expressions refer to complete expansion. When the expansion is incomplete, as it generally is, the expression given above for the work done during expansion still applies if we take Pto be the pressure at the end of expansion, while the work spent on the steam during the back-stroke is P <hi rend="italic subscript"> b <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> Vand that spent on the feed-pump is (P- P <hi rend="italic subscript"> b <,hi> )O·OI7, P <hi rend="italic subscript"> b <,hi> being the back pressure. Incomplete expansion is illustrated by the dotted line in fig. I8. <,p>  It is easy, by the aid of §§ 64 and 67 to extend these calculations to cases where the steam, instead of being initially dry, is supposed to have any assigned degree of wetness. The efficiency which is calculated in this way, which for the present purpose may be called the theoretical efficiency corresponding to the assumed conditions of working, is always much less than the ideal efficiency of a perfect engine, since the cycle we are now dealing with is not reversible. But even this theoretical efficiency, short as it falls of the ideal of a perfect engine, is far greater than can be realized in practice when the same boiler and condenser temperatures are used, and the same ratio of expansion. The reasons for this will bo briefly considered in the next chapter ; at present the fact is mentioned to guard the reader from supposing that the results which the above formulas give apply to actual engines. <,p>  75. The results of § 68 have been turned to account by Rankine and Clausius for the purpose of deducing the density of steam from other properties which admit of more exact direct measurement. Let the perfect steam-engine there described work through a very small interval of temperature ∆τ between two temperatures τ and τ - ∆τ. The efficiency is ∆τ∕τ, and the work done (in foot-lbs. ) is JL∆τ∕τ. The indicator diagram is now reduced to a long narrow strip, whose length is V -O·OI7 and its breadth ∆P, the difference in pressure between steam at temperatures τ and τ-∆τ. Hence the work done is also ∆P(V - O·OI7), and therefore <,p>  V-O∙OI7 = <hi rend="superscript"> JL <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> τ <,hi> · <hi rend="superscript"> ∆τ <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> ∆P <,hi> · <,p>  Here <hi rend="superscript"> ∆τ <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> ∆P <,hi> , or (in the limit) <hi rend="superscript"> dτ <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> dP <,hi> , is the rate of increase of temperature with increase of pressure in saturated steam at the particular temperature τ. It may be found roughly from Table II., p. 484, or more exactly by differentiating the equation given in § 57. L is also known, and hence the value of V corresponding to any assigned temperature may be calculated with a degree of accuracy which it would be difficult to reach in direct experiment. The volumes given in the Table are determined in this way.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="10"> The result of § 75 may be applied as follows to give the formula of § G7 for the adiabatic expansion of wet steam.

In fig. I8 we have what may be called a first approximation to the theoretical indicator diagram of a steam-engine. In the action then described it was assumed—(I) that the steam supplied was dry and saturated, and had during admission the full (uniform) pressure of the boiler P; (2) that there was no transfer of heat to or from the steam except in the boiler and in the condenser ; <,p>  (3) that after more or less complete expansion all the steam was discharged by the return stroke of the piston, during which the back pressure was the (uniform) pressure in the condenser P; (4) that the whole volume of the cylinder was swept through by the piston. It remains to be seen how far these assumptions are untrue in practice, and how far the efficiency is affected in <,p>  consequence. <,p>  The actual conditions of working differ from these in the following main respects, some of which are illustrated by the practical indicator diagram of fig. I9, which is taken from an actual engine. <,p>  77. Owing to the resistance of the ports and passages, and to the inertia of the steam, the pressure within the cylinder is less than Pduring admission and greater than Pduring exhaust. <,p>  Moreover Pand Pare themselves not absolutely uniform, and Pis greater than the pressure of steam at the temperature of the condenser, on account of the presence of air in the condenser. <,p>  During admission the pressure of steam in the cylinder is less than the boiler pressure by an amount which increases as the piston advances, on account of the increased velocity of the piston’s motion and the consequent increased demand for steam. When the ports and passages offer much resistance the steam is expressively said to be throttled or “wire-drawn.” Wire-drawing of steam is in fact a case of imperfectly-resisted expansion (§ 5I). The steam is dried by the process to a small extent, and if initially dry it becomes superheated. In an indicator diagram wire-drawing causes the line of admission to lie below a line drawn at the boiler pressure, and to slope downwards. In fairly good practical instances the mean absolute pressure during admission is about nine-tenths of the pressure in the boiler. <,p>  In the same way, during the exhaust the actual back pressure exceeds the pressure in the condenser (shown by a dotted line in fig. I9) by an amount depending on the freedom with which the steam makes its exit from the cylinder. In condensing engines with a good vacuum the actual back pressure is from 3 to 5 lb per square inch, and in non-condensing engines it is I6 to I8 lb in place of the mere I4·7 lb which is the pressure of the atmosphere. The excess of back pressure may be greatly increased by the presence of water in the cylinder. The effects of wire-drawing do not stop here. The valves open and close more or less slowly; the points of cut-off and release are therefore not absolutely sharp, aud the diagram has rounded corners at <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> in place of the sharp angles which mark those events in fig. I8. For this reason release is allowed in practice to occur a little before the end of the forward stroke, hence the toe of the diagram takes a form like that shown in fig. I9. The sharpness of the cut-off, and to a less extent the sharpness of the release, depends greatly on the kind of valves and valve-gear used; valves of the Corliss type (to be described later), which are noted for the suddenness with which admission of steam is stopped, have the merit amongst others of producing a very sharply defined diagram. <,p>  78. When the piston is at either end of its stroke there is a small space left between it and the cylinder cover. This space, together with the volume of the passage or passages leading thence to the steam and exhaust valves, is called the <hi rend="italic">clearance. <,hi> It constitutes a volume through which the piston does not sweep, but which is nevertheless filled with steam when admission occurs, <,p>  and the steam in the clearance forms a part of the whole steam which expands after the supply from the boiler is cut-off. If AC be the volume swept through by the piston up to release, OA the volume of the clearance, and AB the volume swept through during admission, the apparent ratio of expansion is AC∕AB, but the real <,p>  ratio is (OA + AC)∕ (OA + AB). <,p>  Clearance must obviously be taken <,p>  account of in any calculation of curves of expansion. It is conveniently allowed for in indicator diagrams by shifting the line of no volume back through a distance corresponding to the clearance (fig. 2O). In actual engines OA is from,to <hi rend="subscript"> I,5O <,hi> of the volume of the cylinder. <,p>  79. Clearance affects the thermodynamic efficiency of the engine chiefly by altering the consumption of steam per stroke, and its influence depends materially on the <hi rend="italic">compression <,hi> (§ 72). If during <,p>  the back stroke the process of exhaust is discontinued before the end, and the remaining steam is compressed, this cushion of steam will finally fill the volume of the clearance ; and by a proper selection of the point at which compression begins the pressure of the cushion may be made to rise just up to the pressure at which steam is admitted when the valve opens. This may be called complete compression, and when it occurs the existence of clearance has no direct effect on the consumption of steam nor on the efficiency ; the whole fluid in the cylinder may then be thought of as consisting of two parts,—a permanent cushion which is alternately expanded and compressed without net gain or loss of work, and the working part proper, which on admission fills the volume AB (fig. 2O), and which enters and leaves the cylinder in each stroke. But if compression be incomplete or absent there is, on the opening of the admission valve, an inrush of steam to fill up the clearance space. This increases the consumption to an extent which is only partly counterbalanced by the increased area of the diagram, and the result is that the efficiency is reduced. The action is, in fact, a case of unresisted expansion (§ 5I), and consequently tends, so far as its direct effects go, to make the engine less than ever reversible. It is to be noted, however, that by such unresisted expansion the entering steam is dried to some extent, and this helps in a measure to counteract the cause of loss which will be described below. Compression has the mechanical advantage that it obviates the shock which the admission of steam would otherwise cause, and that by giving the piston work to do while its velocity is being rapidly reduced it reduces those stresses in the mechanism which are due to the inertia of the reciprocating parts. <,p>  8O. The third and generally by far the most important element of difference between the action of a real engine and that of our hypothetical engine is that alluded to at the end of chap. I., the difference which proceeds from the fact that the cylinder and piston are not non-conductors. As the steam fluctuates in temperature there is a complex give-and-take of heat between it and the metal it touches, and the effects of this, though not very conspicuous on the indicator diagram, have an enormous influence in reducing the efficiency by increasing the consumption of steam. Attention was drawn to this action by Mr D. K. Clark as early as I855 (<hi rend="italic">Railway Machinery, <,hi> or art. <hi rend="smallcaps">Steam-Engine, <,hi> <hi rend="italic">Ency. Brit., <,hi> 8th edition<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="11"> See also <hi rend="italic">Min. Proc. Inst. C.E., <,hi> vol. lxxii. p. 275. <,note> ), and the results of his experiments on locomotives were confirmed some years later by Mr Isherwood’s trials of the engines of the United States steamer “ Michigan.” Rankine in his classical work on the steam-engine notices the subject only very briefly, and takes no account of the action of the cylinder walls in his calculations. Its importance has now been established beyond dispute, notably by the experiments of Messrs Loring and Emery on the engines of certain revenue steamers of the United States,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="11"> A useful abstract of Messrs Loring and Emery's reports is given in <hi rend="italic">Engineer <,hi> <,note> and by a protracted series of investigations carried out by M. Hallauer aud other Alsatian engineers under the direction of Him,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="11"> <hi rend="italic">Bull. Soc. Industr. de Mulhouse, <,hi> from I877. For other references, see chap. V. <,note> whose name should be specially associated with the rational analysis of engine tests. In the next chapter some account will be given of how steam- engines are experimentally examined and how (following Him) we may deduce the exchanges of heat which occur between the steam and the cylinder throughout the stroke. The following is, in general terms, what experiments with actual engines show to take place. <,p>  8I. When steam is admitted at the beginning of the stroke, it finds the metallic surfaces of the cylinder and piston chilled by having been in contact with low-pressure steam during the exhaust of the previous stroke. A portion of it is therefore liquefied, and, as the piston advances, more and more of the chilled cylinder surface is exposed and more and more of the hot steam is condensed. At the end of the admission, when communication with the boiler is eut off, the cylinder consequently contains a film of water spread over the exposed surface, in addition to saturated steam. The boiler has therefore been drawn upon for a supply greater than that corresponding to the volume of steam in the admission space. The importance of this will be obvious from the fact, demonstrated by experiment, that the steam which is thus condensed during admission frequently amounts to 3O and even 5O per cent. of the whole quantity that comes over from the boiler. <,p>  82. Then, as expansion begins, more cold metal is uncovered, <,p>  and some of the remaining steam is condensed upon it. But the pressure of the steam now falls, and the layer of water which has been previously deposited begins to be re-evaporated as soon as the temperature of the expanding steam falls below that of the liquid layer. On the whole, then, the amount of water present will increase during the earliest part of the expansion, but a stage will soon be reached when the condensation which occurs on the newly exposed metal is balanced by re-evaporation of older portions of the layer. The percentage of water present is then a maximum ; and from this point onwards the steam becomes more and more dried by re-evaporation of the layer. <,p>  83.

Very usually, however, there is still an undried layer at the end of the forward stroke, and the process of re-evaporation continues during the return stroke, while exhaust is taking place. In extreme cases, if the amount of initial condensation has been very great, the cylinder walls may fail to become quite dry even during the exhaust, and a residue of the layer of condensed water may either be carried over as water into the condenser, or, if the exhaust valves are so badly arranged as to prevent its discharge, this unevaporated residue may gather in the cylinder, requiring perhaps the drain-cocks to be left open to allow of its escape. When any water is retained in this way the initial condensation is enormously increased, for the hot steam then meets not only cold metal but cold water. The latter causes much condensation, partly because of its high specific heat, and partly because it is brought into intimate mixture with the entering steam. <,p>  84. Apart, however, from this extreme case, whatever water is re-evaporated during expansion and exhaust takes heat from the metal of the cylinder, and so brings it into a state that makes condensation inevitable when steam is next admitted from the boiler. Mere contact with low-pressure steam during the exhaust stroke would cool the metal but little ; the cooling which actually occurs is due mainly to the re-evaporation of the condensed water. Thus if an engine were set in action, after being heated beforehand to the boiler temperature, the cylinder would be only slightly cooled during the first exhaust stroke, and little condensation would occur during the next admission. But the metal would be more cooled in the subsequent expansion and exhaust, since it would part with heat in re-evaporating this water. In the third admission more still would be condensed, and so on, until a permanent régime would be established in which condensation and re-evaporation were exactly balanced. The same permanent régime is reached when the engine starts cold. <,p>  85. The wetness of the working fluid to which the action of the walls of the cylinder gives rise is essentially superficial. A film of water forms on the walls, but except for this the body of the steam remains dry, until (by adiabatic or nearly adiabatic expansion) it becomes wet throughout its volume. The water formed by the act of expansion takes form as a mist diffused throughout the steam, and on it the sides of the cylinder exert practically no influence. This latter wetness is in fact increasing while the substance, as a whole, is getting dried by the re-evaporation of the liquid film. During expansion the working substance may be regarded as made up of two parts,—a core of steam, which is expanding adiabatically but is at the same time receiving additions to its amount in the form of saturated steam from the liquid layer, and a liquid layer which is turning into steam. <,p>  86. From a thermodynamic point of view all initial condensation of the steam is bad, for, however early the film be re-evaporated, this can take place only after its temperature has cooled below that of the boiler. The process consequently involves a misapplication of heat, since the substance, after parting with high temperature heat, takes it up again at a temperature lower than the top of its range. This causes a loss of efficiency (chap. II.), and the loss is greater the later in the stroke re-evaporation occurs. The heat that is drawn from the cylinder by re-evaporation of the condensed film becomes less and less effective for doing work as the end of the expansion is approached, and finally, whatever evaporation continues during the back stroke is an unmitigated source of waste. The heat it takes from the cylinder does no work ; its only effect, indeed, is to increase the back pressure by augmenting the volume of steam to be expelled. A small amount of initial condensation reduces the efficiency of the engine but little; a large amount causes a much more than proportionally larger loss. <,p>  87. The action of the cylinder walls is increased by any loss of heat which the engine suffers by radiation and conduction from its external surface. The entering steam has then to give up enough heat to provide for this waste, as well as enough to produce the subsequent re-evaporation of the condensed film. The consequence is that more steam is initially condensed. The loss of efficiency due to this cause will therefore be greater in an unprotected cylinder than in one which is well lagged or covered with nonconducting material. On the other hand, if the engine have a steam-jacket the deleterious action of the walls is reduced. The working substance is then on the whole gaining instead of losing heat by conduction during its passage through the cylinder. The jacket accelerates the process of re-evaporation and tends to make it finish at a point in the stroke when the temperature of the steam is still comparatively high. When the process is complete the cylinder walls give up very little additional heat to the steam during the remainder of the expansion and exhaust, for conduction and radiation between dry steam and the metal of the cylinder are incompetent to cause any considerable exchange of heat. The earlier, therefore, that evaporation is complete the less is the metal chilled, and the less is the subsequent condensation. Moreover, after this stage in the stroke has passed, a steam-jacket continues <,p>  to give heat to the metal during the remainder of the double stroke, and so warms it to a temperature more nearly equal to that of the boiler steam before the next admission takes place. <,p>  88. Thus a steam-jacket, though in itself a thermodynamically imperfect contrivance, inasmuch as its object is to supply heat to the working substance at a temperature lower than the source, acts beneficially by counteracting, to some extent, the more serious misapplication of heat which occurs through the alternate cooling and heating of the cylinder walls. The heat which a jacket communicates to working steam often increases the power of an engine to an extent far greater than corresponds to the extra supply of heat which the jacket itself requires. Besides its thermodynamic effect a jacket has the drawback that it increases waste by external radiation, since.it both enlarges the area of radiating surface and raises its temperature ; notwithstanding this, however, many experiments have shown that in large and especially in slow-running engines, the influence of a steam-jacket on the efficiency is, in general, good; and this is to be ascribed to the fact that it reduces, though it does not entirely remove, the evils of initial condensation. To be effective, however, jackets must be well drained and kept full of “ live ” steam, instead of being, as many are, traps for condensed water or for air. <,p>  89. It is interesting to notice, in general terms, the effects which certain variations of the conditions of working may be expected to produce on the loss that occurs through the action of the cylinder walls. Initial condensation will be increased by anything that augments the range of temperature through which the inner surface of the cylinder fluctuates in each stroke, or that exposes a larger surface of metal to the action of a given quantity of steam, or that prolongs the contacts in which heat is exchanged. The influence of time is specially important; for it must be borne in mind that the whole action depends on the rate at which heat is conducted into the substance of the metal. The changes of temperature which the metal undergoes are in every case mainly superficial ; the alternate heating and cooling of the inner surface initiates waves of high and low temperature in the iron whose effects are sensible only to a small depth ; and the faster the alternate states succeed each other the more superficial are the effects. In an engine making an indefinitely large number of strokes per minute the cylinder sides would behave like non-conductors and the action of the working substance would be adiabatic. <,p>  We may conclude, then, that in general an engine running at a high speed will have a higher thermodynamic efficiency than the same engine running at a low speed, all the other conditions of working being the same in both cases. <,p>  Again, as regards range of temperature, the influence of the cylinder walls will be greater (other things being equal) with high than with low pressure steam, and in condensing than in non- condensing engines. On the other hand, high pressure has the good effect of reducing the surface of metal exposed to the action of each pound of steam. <,p>  In large engines the action of the walls will be less than in small engines, since the proportion of wall surface to cylinder volume is less. This conclusion agrees with the well-known fact that no small engines achieve the economy that is easily reached with larger forms, especially with large marine engines, which eclipse all others in the matter of size. <,p>  Cylinder condensation is increased when the ratio of expansion is increased, all the other circumstances of working being left unaltered. The metal is then brought into more prolonged contact with low-temperature steam. The volume of admission is reduced to a greater extent than the surface that is exposed to the entering steam, since that surface includes two constant quantities, the surface of the cylinder cover and of the piston. For these and perhaps other reasons, we may conclude that with an early cut- off the initial condensation is relatively large ; and this conclusion is amply borne out by experiment. An important result is that increase of expansion does not, beyond a certain limit, involve increase of thermodynamic efficiency ; when that limit is passed the augmentation of waste through the action of the cylinder walls more than balances the increased economy to which, on general principles, expansion should give rise, and the result is a net loss. With a given engine, boiler pressure, and speed, a certain ratio of expansion will give maximum efficiency. But the conditions on which this maximum depends are too complex to admit of theoretical solution ; the best ratio can be determined only by experiment. It may even happen that an engine which is required to work at a specified power will give better results, in point of efficiency, with moderate steam-pressure and moderate expansion, than with high steam-pressure and a <hi rend="italic">very <,hi> early cut-off. <,p>  9O. The effect of increased expansion in augmenting the action of the sides and so reducing the efficiency, when carried beyond a certain moderate grade, is well illustrated by the American and Alsatian experiments alluded to above.

In the American experiments the best results were ob <,p>  tained with even more moderate ratios of expansion. The compound engines of the United States revenue steamer “ Bache,” when tested with steam in the jacket of the large cylinder, with the boiler pressure nearly uniform at 8O lb by gauge, or 95 lb per square inch absolute, and the speed not greatly varied, gave the results shown in Table IV. Here the efficiency is very <,p>  little affected by a large variation in the cut-off, but when the ratio of expansion becomes excessive a distinct loss is incurred. <,p>  Experiments with engines, in the conditions which hold in ordinary practice, show that it is not unusual to find 2O or 3O per cent. of the steam that comes over from the cylinder condensed during admission. In favourable cases the amount is less than this ; occasionally, on the other hand, the amount condensed is as much as half, or even more than half, the whole steam supply. <,p>  9I. The action of the cylinder walls is reduced—(I) by jacketing, (2) by superheating, and (3) by using compound expansion. The advantage of the steam-jacket has been already mentioned. In high-speed engines its beneficial effect is necessarily small, and in certain cases the benefit may be even more than neutralized by the drawbacks which have been alluded to above (§ 88). In general, however, the steam-jacket forms a valuable means of reducing the wasteful action of the cylinder walls, especially when the ratio of expansion is considerable. Experiments made with and without a jacket, on the same engine, have shown that jacketing may increase the efficiency by 2O or 25 per cent. When a jacket is working properly it uses, in a single-cylinder engine, 4 or 5 per cent., and in a compound engine 8 to I2 per cent., of the whole steam supply. <,p>  92. Superheating the steam before its admission reduces the amount of initial condensation, by lessening the quantity of steam needed to give up a specified amount of heat, and this in its turn lessens the subsequent cooling by re-evaporation. That it has a marked advantage in this respect has been experimentally demonstrated by Hirn. On general thermodynamic grounds superheating is good, because it extends the range of temperature through which the working substance is carried. In modern practice superheating (to any considerable extent) is seldom attempted. It occurs to a small extent whenever dry steam is throttled, and a slight superheating is occasionally given to steam in its passage from the high-pressure to the low-pressure cylinder of a compound engine. In former years superheated steam was a common feature of marine practice, but serious practical difficulties caused engineers to abandon its use and to seek economy rather by increasing the initial pressure and using compound expansion. In those days, however, the theoretical advantage of superheating was less understood than it is now. The economy of fuel which its employment would probably secure is so great as to warrant a fresh and energetic attempt to overcome the mechanical difficulties of construction and lubrication that have hitherto stood in the way. <,p>  93. The most important means of preventing cylinder condensation from becoming excessive is the use of compound expansion. If the vessels were non-conductors of heat it would be, from the thermodynamic point of view, a matter of indifference whether expansion was completed in a single vessel or divided between two or more, provided the passage of steam from one to the other was performed without introducing unresisted expansion (§ 5I). But with actual materials the compound system has the important merit that it subjects each cylinder to a greatly reduced range of temperature variation. For this reason the amount initially condensed in the high-pressure cylinder is greatly less than if admission were to take place at once into the low-pressure cylinder and the whole expansion were to be performed there. Further, the steam which is re-evaporated from tho first cylinder during its exhaust does work in the second, and it is only the re-evaporation that occurs during the exhaust from the second cylinder that is absolutely wasteful. The exact advantage of this division of range, as compared with expansion (through the same ratio) in a single cylinder, would be hard to calculate ; but it is easy to see in a general way that an advantage is to be anticipated, and (though there are <,p>  isolated instances to the contrary) experience bears out this conclusion. In large engines, working with high pressure, much expansion, and a slow stroke, the fact that compound engines are in general more efficient than single engines cannot be doubted. Additional evidence to the same effect is furnished when a compound engine is tested first with compound expansion and then as a simple engine with the same grade of expansion in the large cylinder alone. Thus in the American experiments the compound engine of the “Bache” when worked as a simple engine used 24 lb of steam per I.H.P. per hour, as compared with about 2O lb when the engine worked compound, with the same boiler pressure, the same total expansion, and steam in the jacket in both cases. The necessity’ for compounding, if efficiency is to be secured, becomes greater with every increase of boiler pressure. So long as the initial pressure is less than about IOO lb per square inch (absolute) it suffices to reduce the range of temperature into two parts by employing two-cylinder compound engines ; with the higher pressures now common in marine practice triple and even quadruple expansion is being introduced. <,p>  The action of the cylinder walls would be greatly reduced if it were practicable to use a non-conducting material as an internal lining to the cylinder and to the exposed surfaces of the piston. No cure for the evils of initial condensation would be so effectual as this ; and in view of the economy of heat which would result, it is a matter of some surprise that the use of a non-conducting lining has not received more serious attention. <,p>  94. The principal reasons have now been named which make the actual results of engine performance differ from the results which would be obtained if the steam conformed in every respect to the simple theory stated in chap. III. It remains to state, very shortly, a few of the results of recent practice as to the actual efficiency of steam-engines considered as heat-engines. <,p>  The performance of a steam-engine, as regards economy in its consumption of heat, may be stated in a number of ways. In some of these the engine alone is treated as an independent machine ; in others the engine, boiler, and furnace are considered as a whole. <,p>  The performance of the engine alone is best expressed by stating either (I) the thermodynamic “efficiency” or (2) the number of thermal units used per horse-power per minute. These terms require a short explanation. The “efficiency” of a heat-engine has already been defined as the ratio of the work done to the heat supplied. The “ work done ” ought in strictness to be reckoned as the net work done by the working substance in passing through a complete cycle of operations ; it should therefore be determined by subtracting from the work which the substance does in the cylinder the work which is spent upon the substance in the feed-pump. The latter is a comparatively small quantity, and engineers generally neglect it in their calculations of thermodynamic efficiency. In making comparison, however, between the efficiency which is actually realized and the efficiency of a perfect engine or of an engine working under any assumed conditions, account should be taken of the negative work done in the feed-pump. Account should also in strictness be taken of that part of the work spent in driving the air-pump which is done upon the working substance, as distinguished from the water of injection. The “ heat supplied ” is the total heat of the steam delivered to the engine, less the heat contained in the corresponding amount of feed-water. This quantity depends on the amount of steam used, on the temperature of the feed, on the boiler pressure, and on the extent to which the boiler “primes.” Priming is the delivery by the boiler of water mixed with the steam. Except where there is actual superheating the steam supply is always more or less wet ; in a badly designed or overworked boiler large volumes of water may be carried over with the steam, but in a good boiler of adequate size the amount of priming is less (often much less) than 5 per cent. of the whole supply. The effect of priming is, of course, to reduce the supply of heat per lb of the working substance. <,p>  One horse-power is the mechanical equivalent of 42·75 thermal units per minute. The relation between the above two methods of stating engine performance is therefore expressed by the equation <,p>  Efficiency= <hi rend="superscript"> 42·75 <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> Number of T.U. per I.H.P. per minute <,hi> · <,p>  Another very common mode is to give the number of pounds of steam supplied per horse-power per hour. This is unsatisfactory’, even as a method of stating the comparative economy of different engines, or of one engine in different conditions, for several reasons. It ignores variations in boiler pressure, in feed-water temperature, and in the dryness of the supply’, although each of these things affects the amount of heat required for the production of a pound of steam. But the total heat of production of dry steam does not vary greatly within the limits of practical pressures ; moreover, since (in condensing engines) feed-water is generally taken from the hot-well, its temperature does not differ much from that of the air-pump discharge, or (say·), IOO <hi rend="superscript"> o <,hi> F. Finally, in many comparative trials the amount of priming is nearly if not quite constant. Hence it happens that this mode of statement often furnishes a fairly accurate test of the economy of engines, and it <,p</label>>

None of these modes of statement include the efficiency of the boiler and furnace. The performance of a boiler is most usually expressed by giving the number of pounds of water at a stated temperature converted into steam at a stated pressure by the combustion of I lb of coal. The temperature commonly chosen is 2I2° F., and the water is supposed to be evaporated under atmospheric pressure; the result may then be stated as so many pounds of water evaporated from and at 2I2° F. per I lb of coal. But the term “efficiency” may also be applied to a boiler and furnace (considered as one apparatus) in the sense of the ratio between the heat that is utilized and the potential energy that is contained in the fuel. This ratio is, in good boilers, about O·7. Thus, for example, I lb of Welsh coal contains about I5,5OO thermal units of potential energy, an amount which is equal to the heat of production (L) of about I6 lb of steam from and at 2I2°. In practice, however, I lb of coal serves to evaporate only about II lb of water under these conditions, or about 9·5 lb when the feed-water enters at IOO° F. and the absolute pressure is IOO lb per square inch. <,p>  The efficiency of the engine multiplied by that of the furnace and boiler gives a number which expresses the ratio between the heat converted into work and the potential energy of the fuel,—a number which is, in other words, the efficiency of the system of engine, boiler, and furnace considered as a whole. Instead, however, of expressing this idea by the use of the term efficiency, engineers are more usually in the habit of stating the performance of the complete system by giving the number of pounds of coal consumed per horse-power per hour. It must be borne in mind that this quantity depends on the performance of the boiler as much as on that of the engine, and that the difference in thermal value between one kind of coal and another makes it, at the best, a rough way of specifying economy. It is, however, an easy quantity to measure ; and to most users of engines the size of the coal-bill is a matter of greater interest than any results of thermodynamic analysis. Still another expression for engine performance, similar to this last, is the now nearly obsolete term “duty,” or number of foot-pounds of work done for every I cwt. of coal consumed. Its relation to the pounds of coal per horse-power per hour is this— <,p>  Duty= <hi rend="superscript"> II2 × 33OOO × 6O <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> Number of lbs. of coal per I.H.P. per hour <,hi> · <,p>  A good condensing engine of large size, supplied by good boilers, consumes about 2 lb of coal per horse-power per hour ; its duty is then about IIO millions. <,p>  96. To illustrate the subject of this chapter more fully the following summary is given of the results of tests of pumping engines by Mr J. G. Mair, described in two excellent papers in <hi rend="italic">Min. Pro. Inst. Civ. Eng. <,hi> (vols. lxx. and lxxix.).

Under this head we may include experiments made to determine—(<hi rend="italic">a <,hi> ) the horse-power of an engine; (<hi rend="italic">b <,hi> ) the thermodynamic efficiency, or some more or less nearly equivalent quantity, such as the relation of power to steam supply or to coal consumption (§ 95); (<hi rend="italic">c <,hi> ) the distribution of steam, that is, the relation which the several events of steam-admission, expansion, exhaust, and compression bear to the stroke of the piston ; <hi rend="italic">(d) <,hi> the amount of initial condensation, the wetness of the steam throughout the stroke, and the transfer of heat between it and the cylinder walls ; (<hi rend="italic">e <,hi> ) the efficiency of the mechanism, or the ratio which the work done by the engine on the machinery it drives bears to the work done by the steam in the cylinder. <,p>  Tests <hi rend="italic">(a) <,hi> and (c) are of common application ; test <hi rend="italic">(b), <,hi> in the simple form of a comparison of horse-power with coal burnt per hour, is not unusual. The actual measurement of efficiency, whether thermodynamic <hi rend="italic">(b) <,hi> or mechanical (e), and the analysis involved in <hi rend="italic">(d) <,hi> have been carried out in comparatively few instances. <,p>  98. In all these operations the taking of indicator diagrams forms a principal part. The indicator, invented by Watt and improved by M‘Naught and by Richards, consists of a small steam cylinder, fitted with a piston which slides easily within it and is pressed down by a spiral spring of steel wire. The cylinder of the indicator is connected by a pipe below this piston to one or other end of the cylinder of the engine, so that the piston of the indicator rises and falls in response to the fluctuations of pressure which occur in the engine cylinder. The indicator piston actuates a pencil, which rises and. falls with it and traces the diagram on a sheet of paper fixed to a drum that is caused to rotate back and forth through a certain arc, in unison with the motion of the engine piston. In M''Naught's indicator the pencil is directly attached to the indicator piston, in Richards’s the pencil is moved by means of a system of links so that it copies the motion of the piston on a magnified scale. This has the advantage that an equally large diagram is drawn with much less movement of the piston, and errors which are caused by the piston’s inertia are consequently reduced. In high-speed engines especially it is important to minimize the inertia of the indicator piston and the parts connected with it. In Richards’s indicator the linkage employed to multiply the piston’s motion is an arrangement similar to the parallel motion introduced by Watt as a means of guiding the piston-rod in beam engines (see § I88). In several recent forms of indicator lighter linkages are adopted, and other changes have been made with the object of fitting the instrument better for highspeed work. One of these modified forms of Richards’s indicator (the Crosby) is shown in fig. 2I. The pressure of steam in the engine cylinder raises the piston P, <,p>  compressing the spring S and causing <,p>  the pencil Q to rise in a nearly straight <,p>  line through a distance proportional, <,p>  on a magnified scale, to the com <,p>  pression of the spring and therefore <,p>  to the pressure of the steam. At the same time the drum D, which carries the paper, receives motion through the cord C from the crosshead of the en <,p>  gine. Inside this drum there is a spiral spring which becomes wound up when the cord is pulled, and serves to turn the drum in the reverse direction during the back stroke. The cap of the indicator cylinder has holes in it which admit air freely to the top of the piston, aud the piston has room to descend, extending the spring S, when the pressure of the steam is less than that of the atmosphere. The spring is easily taken out and replaced by a more or less stiff one when higher or lower pressures have to be dealt with. <,p>  99. To register correctly, an indicator must satisfy two conditions : (I) the motion of the piston must be proportional to the change of steam pressure in the engine cylinder ; and (2) the motion of the drum must be proportional to that of the engine piston. <,p>  The first of these requires that the pipe which connects the <,p</label>>

Frequently pipes are led from both ends of the cylinder to a central position where the indicator is set, so that diagrams may be taken from either end without shifting the instrument ; much better results are obtained, especially when the cylinder is long, by using a pair of indicators, each fixed with the shortest possible connecting pipe, or by taking diagrams successively from the two ends of the cylinder with a single instrument set first at one end and then at the other. The general effect of an insufficiently free connexion between the indicator and the engine cylinder is to make the diagram too small. The first condition is also invalidated to some extent by the friction of the indicator piston, of the joints in the linkage, and of the pencil on the paper. The piston must slide very freely ; nothing of the nature of packing is permissible, and any steam that leaks past it must have a free exit through the cover. The pencil pressure must not exceed the minimum which is necessary for clear marking. By careful use of a well-made instrument the error due to friction in the piston and connected parts need not be serious. Another source of disturbance is the inertia of these parts, which tends to set them into oscillation whenever the indicator piston suffers a comparatively sudden displacement. These oscillations, superposed upon the legitimate motions of the piston, give a wavy outline to parts of the diagram, especially when the speed is great and when the last-named source of error (the friction) is small. When they appear on the diagram a continuous curve should be drawn midway between the crests and hollows of the undulations. To keep them within reasonable compass in high-speed work a stiff spring must be used aud an indicator with light parts should be selected. Finally, to secure accuracy in the pencil’s movement, the strain of the spring must be kept well within the limit of elasticity, so that the strain may be as nearly as possible proportional to the steam pressure. Care must be taken that the spring is graduated to suit the temperature (about 2I2° F.) to which it is exposed when in use ; its stiffness at this temperature is about 3 per cent. less than when cold. <,p>  With regard to the motion of the drum, it is, in the first place, necessary to have a reduciug mechanism which will give a sufficiently accurate copy, on a small scale, of the engine piston’s stroke. Many contrivances are used for this purpose ; in some a rigorous geometrical solution of the problem is aimed at, in others a close approximation only. Fig. 22 shows a good form of indicator gear. A pendulum rod AB is pinned at one end <,p>  to the crosshead A (the end of the piston-rod) of the engine. Its upper end is carried by a pin which is free to turn and slide in the fixed slot B. A cord from an intermediate point C leads over pulleys to the indicator drum. The pendulum rod should be much longer than the piston stroke, and the cord should lead off for a considerable distance in the direction sketched, at right angles to the mean position of the rods. <,p>  The accuracy of the drum’s motion does not, however, depend merely on the geometrical condition of the gear. It depends also on the rigidity of the parts, and especially on the stretching of the cord. The elasticity of the cord will cause error if it is not maintained in a state of uniform tension throughout the double stroke, and this error will be greater the longer and the more extensible the cord is. Hence short cords are to be preferred ; and fine wire, which stretches much less, may often be substituted for cord with great advantage. The stretching of the cord is perhaps the most serious and least noticed source of error the indicator is subject to in ordinary practice. The tension of the cord varies for three reasons,—the inertia of the drum, the varying resistance of the drum spring, aud the friction of the drum, which has the effect of increasing the tension during the forward stroke and of reducing it during the back stroke. This last cause of variation can be minimized only by good construction and careful use of the instrument ; but the other two causes can be made to neutralize one another almost completely. Since the motion is nearly simple harmonic, the acceleration of the drum varies in a nearly uniform manner from end to end of the stroke. The resistance of the drum spring also varies uniformly ; and it is therefore only necessary to adjust the stiffness of the drum spring so that the increase in its resistance as the motion of the drum proceeds may balance the decrease in the force that the cord has to exert in setting the drum into motion. This adjustment will secure an almost uniform tension in the cord throughout the whole stroke ; it must, of course, be altered to suit different engine speeds. The indicator plays so important a part in the testing of heat-engines, whether for practical or scientific purposes, that no pains should be spared to avoid the numerous and serious sources of error to which it is liable through faulty construction or unintelligent use.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="14"> A valuable discussion and experimental investigation of tho errors of the indicator will he found in papers by Prot. Osborne Reynolds and Mr H. W. <,note> <,p>  IOO. To determine the indicated horse-power, the mean effective pressure is found by dividing the area of the diagram by the length of its base. This gives a mean height, which, interpreted on the scale of pressures, is the mean effective pressure in pounds per square inch. This has to be multiplied by the effective area of the piston in square inches and by the length of the piston stroke in feet, to find the work done per stroke in foot-pounds on that side of the piston to which the diagram refers. Let Abe the area of the piston on one side and Aon the other ; <hi rend="italic">p <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">p <,hi> the mean effective pressures on the two sides respectively ; L the length of the stroke in feet ; and <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> the number of complete double strokes or revolutions per minute.

A less accurate plan, frequently followed, is to divide the diagram by lines drawn at the middle of strips of equal width, as in figs. 23 and 24, aud to take the mean pressure as the average height of these lines. <,p>  IOI. Space admits of no more than a few illustrations of actual indicator diagrams. Fig. 23 is a diagram taken from an antiquated non-condensing engine working without ex <,p>  pansion. The line AB has been drawn at a <,p>  height which represents the boiler pressure, in <,p>  order to show the loss of pressure in admission. <,p>  The line CD is drawn at atmospheric pressure <,p>  by the indicator itself. In this engine ad <,p>  mission continues till the end of the forward <,p>  stroke, and as a result the back pressure is <,p>  great, especially during the first stage of the <,p>  exhaust. The diagram shows a slight amount of oscillation produced by the sudden admission of steam. This feature, however, is better illustrated by fig. 24, which is another <,p>  diagram taken from the same engine, at the same boiler pressure, but with the steam much throttled. <,p>  Fig. 25 shows a pair of diagrams taken from a condensing engine in which the distribution of steam is effected by a common slide valve (chap. VIII.). The two diagrams refer to opposite ends of the cylinder and are taken on the same paper by the plan already alluded to (§ 99) of fixing the indi <,p>  cator about midway between the ends of the cylinder, with a pipe leading from it to each end. Steam is cut off at <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">a' <,hi> , release occurs at <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">b' <,hi> and compression begins at <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">c'. <,hi> <,p>  The gradual closing of the slide valves throttles the steam considerably before the cut-off is complete. The line of no pressure EF is drawn I4·7 lb per square inch below CD, which is the atmospheric line ; and the line of no volume AE or BF is drawn (for each end of the cylinder) at a distance (from the end of the diagram) equal to the volume of the clearance. <,p>  Fig. 26 is a diagram taken from a Corliss engine working with a large ratio of expansion. The Corliss valve-gear, which will be described in chap. IX., causes the admission valve to close suddenly, and consequently defines the point of cut-off’ pretty sharply in the diagram. Through this point a dotted curve has been drawn (by aid of the equation PV <hi rend="italic superscript"> n <,hi> = const., § 67), which is the curve that would be followed if the expansion were adiabatic. In drawing this curve it has been assumed that at the end of admission the steam contains 25 per cent. of water. The actual curve first falls below and then rises above this adiabatic curve, in consequence of the continued condensation which takes place during the early stages of the expansion and the re-evaporation of condensed water during later stages (§ 82). Fig. 27 is another diagram from a Corliss engine, running light, and with the condenser not in action. Diagrams of this kind are often taken when engines are first erected, for the purpose of testing the setting of the valves. Other indicator diagrams, for compound engines, <,p>  will be given in chap. VI. <,p>  Brightmore <hi rend="italic">(Min. Proc. Inst. C.E., <,hi> voi. lxxxiii., I886).

In tests of thermodynamic efficiency we may measure either the heat supplied or the heat rejected, and compare it with the work done. The heat supplied is on the whole capable of more exact measurement, but in any case a determination of the heat rejected furnishes a valuable check on the accuracy of the result. The trial must be continued for a period of some hours at least, during which the engine and boiler are to be kept working as uniformly as possible in all respects. The power is determined by taking indicator diagrams at short intervals. The heat supplied is found by noting the amount of feed-water required to keep the water- level in the boiler constant during the trial, the temperature of the feed, aud the pressure of the steam. The only uncertainty which attaches to the measurement of heat-supply is due to priming. Every pound of water that passes over unevaporated to the engine takes less heat by the amount L (§ 6O) than if it went over in the state of steam. To measure the degree of wetness in steam is a matter of some difficulty ; it may be done by passing the steam into a known quantity of cold water, so as to condense it, and observing the rise of temperature which has taken place when the whole quantity of water present has increased by a measured amount. <,p>  If Lbe the latent heat of steam at the boiler pressure, <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> the heat in the feed-water per lb, <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> the heat in the boiler water per lb, and <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> the dryness of the steam as it leaves the boiler, the heat taken in per lb of the substance supplied to the cylinder is <,p>  <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> L+ <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> — <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> <hi rend="italic">. <,hi> <,p>  To this must be added, in the case of a jacketed engine, the heat supplied to the jacket, a quantity which depends on the amount of steam condensed there, and also on whether the water that gathers in the jacket is drained back into the boiler or allowed to escape into the hot-well. <,p>  The heat rejected by an engine fitted with an injection condenser is made up of the following parts :—(<hi rend="italic">a <,hi> ) heat rejected in the condensed water, less the heat returned to the boiler in the feed (if the feed is directly drawn from the hot-well without giving the water time to cool sensibly, this quantity vanishes ; in a jacketed engine this item must include the heat rejected in the jacket drains) ; (ό) heat used in warming the condenser water from the temperature of injection to the temperature of the air-pump discharge ; (c) heat rejected in air and vapour from the air-pump ; (<hi rend="italic">d <,hi> ) heat lost by radiation, conduction to supports, and aerial convection,—or, more properly, the excess of this heat over the heat developed within the engine by the friction of piston, valves, &amp;amp;c. Of these quantities, (<hi rend="italic">a <,hi> ) is found without difficulty from a knowledge of the amount of the feed-water, its temperature, the temperature of the air-pump discharge, and amount and temperature of water drained from the jacket ; (5) is measured by gauging the whole discharge from the pump, deducting from it the amount returned to the boiler as feedwater, and measuring its temperature and that of the injection water ; (<hi rend="italic">c <,hi> ) does not admit of direct measurement ; (<hi rend="italic">d <,hi> ) may be approximately estimated for a jacketed engine by filling the jacket with steam while the engine is out of action, and observing the amount of steam condensed in the jacket during a long interval, through radiation, &amp;amp;c., from the external surface. <,p>  In calculating the supply of heat by the boiler it is convenient to take the temperature 32° F. as a starting point from which to reckon what may be termed the gross supply, and then to deduct from this the heat which is restored to the boiler in the feed-water. The difference, which may be called the net supply, is the true consumption of heat, and is to be used in calculating the efficiency of the engine. A similar convention may be followed in dealing with the heat rejected. <,p>  IO3. This subject is most easily made intelligible by help of a numerical example. For this purpose the following data of an actual engine-test have been taken from one of Mr Mair’s papers<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="15"> <hi rend="italic">Min. Proc.

The balance is made up of heat rejected in air and vapour by the air-pump, heat lost by radiation, &amp;amp;c., and errors of experiment. In the example considered the loss by radiation was estimated at 45 thermal units, which reduces the discrepancy between the two sides of the account to 48 units, or only about 3 per cent. of the whole heat supplied. <,p>  The efficiency of the engine is <hi rend="superscript"> 227 <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> I55I <,hi> or O·I46. The efficiency of a perfect engine working between the same limits of temperature, 3O8° F. and 5O° F., would be O·335. <,p>  IO4. When it is desired to deduce from the test of an engine not only the thermodynamic efficiency but also the amount of initial condensation and the subsequent changes of wetness which the working fluid undergoes during expansion, it is necessary to know, in addition to the above data, the volume of cylinder and clearance, the relation of pressure to volume during the several stages of the stroke, and the whole amount of working substance present in the cylinder. This last is a quantity whose precise value is not easily ascertained. Assuming that the point at which compression begins can be distinguished on the diagram, we have the pressure and the volume of the steam that is afterwards compressed into the clearance space. From its pressure and volume we can infer its amount, if only its degree of dryness be known. The assumption usually made is that at the beginning of compression the steam shut up in the cylinder is dry. This assumption is to a certain extent supported by the fact that re-evaporation has been going on during expansion and exhaust ; in good engines it is probably not far from the truth, though there are cases where, owing to excessive initial condensation and to the exhaust ports being badly situated for draining the cylinder, water may accumulate in considerable quantities. Except in extreme cases of this kind, however, the assumption that the steam is dry when compression begins does not introduce an error which can seriously affect the subsequent calculations. Having found the quantity shut up in the clearance, we add to it the quantity delivered from the boiler per single stroke, to find the whole quantity of working substance in the cylinder. The substance is, and continues, a mixture in varying proportions of steam and water. Its volume may practically be taken as the volume of the dry steam it contains, the volume of the water being comparatively small. Taking any point of the stroke, and measuring the pressure and the volume there, we can say how much steam (at that pressure) would be required to fill the volume which the mixture then occupies. This quantity will always be less than the actual amount of the mixture ; and the difference between them is the amount of water that is present. This calculation is of special interest at two places in the stroke—the point of cut-off and the point of release. <,p>  IO5. To illustrate it we may continue the numerical example quoted above. In the high-pressure cylinder of the engine to which the test refers the volume at the beginning of compression (including clearance) was I·52 cubic feet. The pressure, just before compression began, is shown by the indicator diagram (of which fig. 28 is a copy) to have been I4·8 lb per square inch. At this pres <,p>  sure the density (or mass of I cubic foot) <,p>  of steam is O·O38 lb. Hence (on the above <,p>  assumption that the steam was then dry) <,p>  the quantity shut up in the clearance was <,p>  l∙52×O∙O38 = O∙O58 lb. <,p>  The amount delivered to the cylinder per single stroke (or half revolution) was O·6O4 lb). The whole quantity of working substance present from the end of the admission to the beginning of the exhaust was therefore O·662 lb. <,p>  At the point of cut-off the pressure is shown by the diagram to have been 64 lb per square inch (absolute), and the volume, including clearance, was 2·92 cubic feet. The density of steam for this <,p</label>>

Hence, out of the whole mixture, the amount of steam was 2·92 × O·I5I = O·44O lb. The water present at the point of cut-off was therefore O·662 - O·44O or O·222 lb. This is 33·5 per cent. of the whole amount of the mixture, and shows (after allowing for the priming water) that about 32 per cent. of the steam admitted was condensed on admission. <,p>  Next, to find the amount of water present at the end of the expansion. The diagram shows that at this point the pressure was I5·2 lb per square inch and the volume I3·235 cubic feet. Steam of this pressure has a density of O·O392 lb per cubic foot. The quantity of steam at release was therefore I3·235 × O·O392, or O·5I9 lb, and the quantity of water O·662 - O·5I9 = O·I43 lb. It appears therefore that re-evaporation from the cylinder walls during expansion reduced the amount of water present by O·O79 lb, so that the percentage of water fell from 33·5 at the point of cut-off to 2I·6 at the point of release. The same method of calculation can obviously be applied to any other point in the expansion curve, and can be extended to the low-pressure cylinder of an engine which (like the one in this example) is compound. The amount of dry steam present at the point of release is sometimes spoken of as the “steam accounted for by the indicator diagram.” <,p>  IO6. Having completed this analysis of the working-substance, we may proceed to find the quantity of heat whieh it gives to or takes from the walls of the cylinder during any stage of its action, by considering the changes of internal energy whieh the working substance undergoes, along with the external work done, from stage to stage. If we write <hi rend="italic">m <,hi> for the amount of steam and <hi rend="italic">m' <,hi> for the amount of water present in the cylinder at any one stage, the internal energy of the mixture is (§ 62) <,p>  (<hi rend="italic">m <,hi> + <hi rend="italic">m' <,hi> ) <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> + <hi rend="italic">m <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> p <,hi> <hi rend="italic">. <,hi> <,p>  Let the value of this quantity be denoted by I <hi rend="subscript"> A <,hi> at any one stage in the expansion or compression of the mixture, such as the point of cut-off A, and by I <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> b <,hi> at a later stage, such as the point of release B, the corresponding volumes of the whole mixture being <hi rend="smallcaps">V <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> a <,hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">V <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> b <,hi> respectively. Then in passing from the first condition to the second the substance loses <hi rend="smallcaps">I <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> a <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">- I <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> b <,hi> of internal energy. It also does <,p>  V <,p>  an amount of external work <hi rend="smallcaps">W <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> ab <,hi> measured by ∕ P <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> V, or the area <hi rend="smallcaps">V <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> a <,hi> <,p>  of the figure AB <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> .

The calculation applies equally, however, in determining the heat taken up during any stage of the process. When this has a negative value heat has been given up by the substance to the cylinder walls. In the numerical example which has been cited above the internal energy of the mixture at the beginning of expansion was 54O thermal units. At the end of expansion the internal energy was 584 thermal units. Between these points the indicator diagram (fig. 28) shows that the work done was equivalent to 55 thermal units. 44 + 55 = 99 units of heat were therefore taken from the cylinder walls during the process of expansion. A similar calculation, applied to the compression curve, shows that in that part of the operation heat was given up to the cylinder walls. During compression W is of course negative, since work is then spent upon the steam. <,p>  IO7. During admission and also during exhaust another item enters into the account,—the amount of the working substance is then undergoing change. To find the heat given up by the steam during admission we have first to calculate (by the method already described) the internal energy of the mixed steam and water that is shut into the clearance space at the end of the previous stroke ; this may be called <hi rend="smallcaps">I <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> d <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">. <,hi> The steam which then enters brings with it an additional amount of internal energy which we may calculate from a knowledge of the quantity of steam, its pressure at admission, and its dryness. Let I <hi rend="subscript"> o <,hi> denote this additional supply of internal energy. At the end of admission the state of the mixture is known from the indicator diagram ; hence its internal energy <hi rend="smallcaps">I <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> a <,hi> may be found. The work done during admission, <hi rend="smallcaps">W <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> da <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">, <,hi> is also determined from the diagram. Then we have, for the heat given up by the steam during admission, <,p>  <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> da <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">= I <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> d <,hi> + I <hi rend="subscript"> o <,hi> - <hi rend="smallcaps">I <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> a <,hi> - W <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> da <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">. <,hi> <,p>  In attempting to apply the same method of calculation to determine the heat taken up from the cylinder walls during exhaust <hi rend="smallcaps">(Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">), <,hi> we are met by the difficulty that we do not know the state, as regards dryness, of the mixture during its expulsion from the cylinder. We may, however, estimate the value of <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> as follows. Let <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> cd <,hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> da <,hi> be, as before, the heat given up by the steam to the cylinder walls during compression and admission respectively, and let <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> ab <,hi> be the heat taken from the cylinder walls during exhaust ; also let <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> r <,hi> be the heat which the cylinder loses (per single stroke) by radiation (less the heat produced by piston and valve friction), and Q <hi rend="subscript"> J <,hi> the heat which it gains by condensation of steam <,p>  in the jacket, if there is one. Then, as the cylinder neither gains nor loses heat on the whole, after a uniform régime has been arrived at, we have <hi rend="smallcaps">q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc = <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> cd <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">+ Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> DA <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">+ Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> J <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">- Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> R <,hi> <,p>  The quantity <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> may also be calculated directly from a knowledge of the gross heat rejected to the condenser, since the gross heat rejected is <,p>  <hi rend="smallcaps">I <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> b <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">+ W <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">+ Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">, <,hi> <,p>  <hi rend="smallcaps">I <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> b <,hi> being the internal energy of the mixture at release aud <hi rend="smallcaps">W <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> being the work done upon the steam in expelling it from the cylinder. <,p>  IO8. This heat <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">, <,hi> which is taken up by the steam from the cylinder walls during exhaust, is a part of the heat deposited there during admission. It has passed through the cylinder without contributing in the smallest degree to the work of the engine. Probably for this reason it is treated by some writers as a quantity whieh measures the wasteful influence of the cylinder walls. This, however, is not strictly the case. The magnitude of <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> is certainly in some sense an index of the extent to which the alternate heating and cooling of the metal causes inefficiency ; it is so much heat absolutely lost, and lost by the action of the walls. [In the high- pressure cylinder of a compound engine this loss is, of course, absolute only as regards that cylinder ; the heat represented by Q <hi rend="subscript"> BC <,hi> assists in the work of the low-pressure cylinder.] But besides this loss there is another which the walls cause by taking heat from the steam on admission and restoring it during the later stages of expansion. That part of the heat abstracted during admission which is restored before the point of release does not appear in <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">; <,hi> nevertheless it is a source of inefficiency. With steam that is dry at the end of the expansion the value of <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> is almost negligible ; still the cylinder walls may cause a very sensible loss by abstracting heat from the hot steam as it enters and restoring it as the mixture expands. The quantity which has been denoted here by <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">— <,hi> that heat, namely, which the steam takes up from the cylinder walls after release and during exhaust—appears in the writings of Hirn and his followers under the symbol R <hi rend="italic subscript"> c <,hi> .

It is obvious that the above analysis depends fundamentally on the strict accuracy with which the indicator diagram not only gives a measure of the work done by the engine under test, but shows the relation of pressure to volume at each stage in the process. Engine tests of a complete kind have now been made and discussed by a number of independent observers, working with widely different data. The results are in good general agreement. They demonstrate the influence of the sides beyond question, showing that 3O per cent. is no unusual amount of water to be present in the mixture at the point of cut-off, even in compound engines of the best types ; that half of this water, or even more, is frequently found at the end of expansion ; and that the heat denoted above by <hi rend="smallcaps">Q <,hi> <hi rend="subscript smallcaps"> bc <,hi> ranges from about IO to 2O per cent. of the whole heat supplied.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="16"> In this connexion reference should be made to the data supplied by the American experiments (of Messrs Emery and Loring), some of which are discussed fully by Prof. Cotterill ; also to the writings of Hirn and the extensive researches of the Alsatian engineers alluded to in chap.

The <hi rend="italic">Report <,hi> for I884 especially exhibits the results of a test with unique fulness and clearness. The <hi rend="italic">Journal <,hi> of the Franklin Institute for I885 contains an account of experiments by Messrs Gately and Kletzsch on one engine, under varied conditions of boiler pressure, expansion, and speed; these, so far as they go, confirm the conclusions stated, on general grounds, in chap. IV. For a synopsis of Hirn s method of analysis reference should be made to a paper by M. Poupardin, <hi rend="italic">Bull. Soc. Ind. de Mulhouse, <,hi> March 3I, I875. <,note> <,p>  IIO. An engine employed to drive other machinery delivers to it an amount of power less than the indicated power by an amount which is wasted in overcoming the friction of piston and piston- rod, slides, valves, journals, &amp;amp;c. The efficiency of the mechanism is the ratio of the “effective” or “brake” horse-power to the indicated horse-power. It may be tested by measuring the power delivered by the engine when at work, either by using a transmission dynamometer or by substituting an absorption dynamometer for the mechanism usually driven. In the case of a pumping engine the efficiency of the engine and pumps together may be determined by observing the actual work done in raising water or in delivering a measured volume against a known pressure. Attempts are sometimes made to find the amount of power wasted in engine friction by testing the indicated power needed to drive the engine against no other resistance than its own friction. This, however, fails to show the power which will be spent in overcoming friction when the engine runs under ordinary conditions, since the pressures at the slides, the journals, and elsewhere are then widely different from what they are when the engine is running without load. Experiments with large engines show that the efficiency of the mechanism may, in favourable cases, be O·85 or even O·9 <hi rend="italic">; in <,hi> small engines, or in large engines running under light loads, it is generally much less than this. <,p</label>>

In the original form of compound engine, invented by Hornblower and revived by Woolf, steam passed directly from the first to the second cylinder ; the exhaust from the first and admission to the second went on together throughout the whole of the back stroke. This arrangement is possible only when the high and low pressure pistons begin and end their strokes together, that is to say, when their movements either coincide in phase or differ by half a revolution. Engines of the “tandem” type satisfy this condition—engines, namely, whose high and low pressure cylinders are in one line, with one piston-rod common to both pistons. Engines in which the high and low pressure cylinders are placed side by side, and act either on the same crank or on cranks set at I8O° apart, may also discharge steam directly from one to the other cylinder; the same remark applies to beam engines, whether of the class in which both pistons act on one end of the beam, or of the class introduced by M'Naught, in which the high and low pressure cylinders stand on opposite sides of the centre. By a convenient usage which is now pretty general the name “Woolf engine” is restricted to those compound engines which discharge steam directly from the high to the low pressure cylinders without the use of an intermediate receiver. <,p>  II2. An intermediate receiver becomes necessary when the phases of the pistons in a compound engine do not agree. With two cranks at right angles, for example, a portion of the discharge from the high-pressure cylinder occurs at a time when the low-pressure cylinder cannot properly receive steam. The receiver is in some cases an entirely independent vessel connected to the cylinders by pipes ; very often, however, a sufficient amount of receiver volume is afforded by the valve casings and the steam-pipe which connects the cylinders. The receiver, when it is a distinct vessel, is frequently jacketed. <,p>  The use of a receiver is of course not restricted to engines in which the “Woolf” system of compound working is impracticable. On the contrary, it is frequently applied with advantage to beam and tandem compound engines. Communication need not then be maintained between the high and low pressure cylinders during the whole of the stroke; admission to the low-pressure cylinder is stopped before the stroke is completed ; the steam already admitted is allowed to expand independently ; and the remainder of the discharge from the high-pressure cylinder is compressed into the intermediate receiver. Each cylinder has then a definite point of cut-off, and by varying these points the distribution of work between the two cylinders may be adjusted at will. In general it is desirable to make both cylinders of a compound engine contribute equal quantities of work. If they act on separate cranks this has the effect of giving the same value to the mean twisting moment on both cranks. <,p>  II3. Wherever a receiver is used, care should be taken that there is no unresisted expansion into it; in other words, the pressure in the receiver should be equal to that in the high-pressure cylinder at the moment of release. If the receiver pressure is less than this there will be what is termed a “drop” in the steam pressure between the high-pressure cylinder and the receiver, which will show itself in an indicator diagram by a sudden fall at the end of the high-pressure expansion. This “drop” is, from the thermodynamic point of view, irreversible, and therefore wasteful. It can be avoided by selecting a proper point of cut-off in the low- pressure cylinder. When there is no “drop’’the expansion that occurs in a compound engine has precisely the same effect in doing work as the same amount of expansion in a simple engine would have, provided the law of expansion be the same in both and the waste of energy which occurs by the friction of ports and passages in the transfer of steam from one to the other cylinder be negligible. The work done in either case depends merely on the relation of pressure to volume throughout the process; and so long as that relation is unchanged it is a matter of indifference whether the expansion be performed in one vessel or in more than one. It has, however, been fully pointed out in chap. IV. that in general a compound engine has a thermodynamic advantage over a simple engine using the same pressure and the same expansion, inasmuch as it reduces the exchange of heat between the working substance and the cylinder walls and so makes the process of expansion more nearly adiabatic. The compound engine has also a mechanical advantage which will be presently described. The ultimate ratio <,p>  of expansion in any compound engine is the ratio of the volume of the low- pressure cylinder to the volume of steam admitted to the high-pressure cylinder. Fig. 29 illustrates the combined action of the two cylinders in a hypothetical compound engine of the Woolf type, in which for simplicity the effect of clearance is neglected and also the loss of pressure which the steam undergoes in transfer from one to the other cylinder. ABCD is the indicator diagram of the high-pressure cylinder. The exhaust line CD shows a falling <,p>  pressure in consequence of the increase of volume which the steam is then undergoing through the advance of the low-pressure piston. EFGH is the diagram of the low-pressure cylinder drawn alongside of the other for convenience in the construction which follows. It has no point of cut-off ; its admission line is the continuous curve of expansion EF, which is the same as the high-pressure exhaust line CD, but drawn to a different scale of volumes. At any point K, the actual volume of the steam is KL + MN. By drawing OP equal to KL + MN, so that OP represents the whole volume, and repeating the same construction at other points of the diagram, we may set out the curve QPR, the upper part of which is identical with BC, and so complete a single diagram which exhibits the equivalent expansion in a single cylinder. <,p>  In a tandem compound engine of the receiver type the diagrams resemble those shown in fig. 3O. During CD (which corresponds to FG) expansion is taking place into the large or low- pressure cylinder. D and G mark the point of cut-off in the large cylinder, after which GH shows the independent expansion of the steam now shut within the large cylinder, and DE shows the compression of steam by continued discharge from the small cylinder into the receiver. At the end of the stroke the receiver pressure is OE, and this must be the same as the pressure at C, if there is to be no “drop.” Diagrams of a similar kind may be sketched without difficulty for the case of a receiver engine with <,p>  any assigned phase relation between the pistons.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="17"> An intermediate receiver lias the thermodynamic advantage that it reduces the range of temperature in the high-pressure cylinder, and so helps to prevent initial condensation of the steam. This will he made obvious by a comparison of fig. 29 and fig. 3O. The lowest temperature reached in the high-pressure cylinder is that corresponding to the pressure at D, and is materially higher in fig. 3O than in fig. 29. <,note> <,p>  II4. By making the cut-off take place earlier in the large cylinder we increase the mean pressure in the receiver ; the work done in the small cylinder is consequently diminished. The work done in the large cylinder is correspondingly increased, for the total work (depending as it does on the initial pressure and the total ratio of expansion) is unaffected by the change. The same adjustment serves, in case there is “drop,” to remove it. By selecting a suitable ratio of cylinder volumes to one another and to the volume of the receiver, and also by choosing a proper point for the low- pressure cut-off, it is possible to secure absence of drop along with equality in the division of the work between the two cylinders. <,p>  To determine that point of cut-off in the low-pressure cylinder which will prevent drop when the ratio of cylinder and receiver volumes is assigned is a problem most easily solved by a graphic process. The process consists in drawing the curve of pressure during admission to the low-pressure cylinder until it meets the curve of expansion which is common to both cylinders.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="17"> See a paper by Prof. R. H. Smith, “Οn the Cut-off in the Large Cylinder of Compound Engines,” <hi rend="italic">The Engineer, <,hi> November 27, I885. <,note> Thus in fig. 3I (where for the sake of simplicity the effects of clearance are neglected) AB represents the admission line and BC the expansion line in the small cylinder. Release occurs at C, and from C to D steam is being taken by the large cylinder. <,p>  D corresponds to the cutoff in the large cylinder, which is the point <,p>  to be found. From D to E steam is being compressed into the receiver. To avoid drop the receiver pressure at E is to be the same as the pressure at C. E is therefore known, and may be employed as the starting-point in drawing a curve EF which is the admission line of the low-pressure diagram EFGHI. This line is drawn by considering at each point in the low-pressure piston’s stroke what is then the whole volume of the steam. The place at which EF intersects the continuous expansion curve BCG determines the proper point of cut-off. The sketch (fig. 3I) refers to the case of a tandem receiver engine ; but the process may also be applied to an engine with any assumed phase relation between the cranks. Fig. 32 shows a pair of theoretical indicator diagrams determined in the same way for an engine with cranks at right angles, the high-pressure crank leading. In using the graphic method any form may be assigned to the curve of expansion. Generally this curve may be treated without serious inaccuracy as a common hyperbola, in which the pressure varies inversely as the volume. <,p>  II5. If this simple relation between pressure and volume be assumed, it is practicable to find algebraically the low-pressure cutoff which will give no drop, with assigned ratios of cylinder and <,p</label>>

Taking the simplest case—that of a tandem engine, or of an engine with parallel cylinders whose pistons move together or in opposition—we may proceed thus. Since the point of cut-off to be determined depends on volume ratios we may for brevity treat the volume of the small cylinder as unity. Let R be the ratio to it of the receiver’s volume, and L that of the low- pressure cylinder. Let <hi rend="italic">x <,hi> be the required fraction of the stroke at which cut-off is to occur in the large cylinder ; and let <hi rend="italic">p <,hi> be the pressure at release from the small cylinder. As there is to be no drop, <hi rend="italic">p <,hi> is also the pressure in the receiver at the beginning of admission to the large cylinder. During that admission the volume changes from I + R to I - <hi rend="italic">x <,hi> : + R + <hi rend="italic">x <,hi> L, and the pressure at cut-off is <,p>  therefore <hi rend="italic superscript"> p <,hi> <hi rend="superscript"> (I+R) <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> I- <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> x <,hi> <hi rend="subscript"> +R+ <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> x <,hi> <hi rend="subscript"> L <,hi> .The steam that remains is now compressed into the receiver, from volume I - <hi rend="italic">x <,hi> + R to volume R. Its pressure therefore rises to <hi rend="italic superscript"> p <,hi> <hi rend="superscript"> (I+R) <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> I- <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> x <,hi> <hi rend="subscript"> +R+ <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> x <,hi> <hi rend="subscript"> L <,hi> · <hi rend="superscript"> (I- <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> x <,hi> <hi rend="superscript"> +R) <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> R <,hi> , and this, by assumption, is to be equal to <hi rend="italic">p <,hi> .

Sennett’s <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Marine Steam Engine. <,hi> <,note> for a compound engine whose cranks are at right angles, and in which cut-off occurs in the large cylinder before half-stroke, shows that the condition of no drop is secured when <,p>  2R(<hi rend="italic">x <,hi> L-I) = I - 2√ <hi rend="italic">x <,hi> (l <hi rend="italic">-x <,hi> ) <hi rend="italic">. <,hi> <,p>  In some compound engines a pair of high-pressure cylinders discharge into a common receiver; in some a pair of low-pressure cylinders are fed from a receiver which takes steam from one high- pressure cylinder, or in some instances from two. With these arrangements the pressure in the receiver may be kept much more nearly constant than is possible with the ordinary two-cylinder type. <,p>  II6. An important mechanical advantage belongs to the compound engine in the fact that it avoids the extreme thrust and pull which would have to be borne by the piston-rod of a single-cylinder engine working at the same power with the same initial pressure and the same ratio of expansion. If all the expansion took place in the low-pressure cylinder, the piston at the beginning of the stroke would be exposed to a thrust much greater than the sum of the thrusts on the two pistons of a compound engine in which a fair proportion of the expansion is performed in the small cylinder. Thus in the tandem engine of fig. 29 the greatest sum of the thrusts will be found to amount to less than two-thirds of the thrust which the large piston would be subjected to if the engine were simple. The mean thrust throughout the stroke is of course not affected by compounding; only the range of variation in the thrust is reduced. The effort on the crank-pin is consequently made more uniform, the strength of the parts may be reduced, and the friction at slides and journals is lessened. The advantage in this respect is obviously much greater when the cylinders are placed side by side, instead of tandem, and work on cranks at right angles. As a set-off to its advantage in giving a more uniform effort, the compound engine has the drawback of requiring more working parts than a simple engine with one cylinder. But in many instances—as in marine engines—two cranks and two cylinders are almost indispensable, to give a tolerably uniform effort and to get over the dead points ; and the comparison should then be made between a pair of simple cylinders and a pair of compounded cylinders. Another point in favour of the compound engine is that, although the whole ratio of expansion is great, there need not be a very early cut-off in either cylinder ; hence the common slide-valve, which is unsuited to give an early cut-off, may be used in place of a more complex arrangement. The mechanical advantage of the compound engine has long been recognized, and had much to do with its adoption in the early days of high-pressure steam.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="18"> See a paper by Dr W. Pole, “ On the Double Cylinder Expansive Engine,” <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. M.E., <,hi> I862. <,note> Its subsequent development has been due in part to this, but probably in much greater part to the thermodynamic advantage which has been discussed above (§ 93). <,p>  II7. Indicator diagrams taken from compound engines show that the transfer of steam from one cylinder to another is never, under the most favourable conditions, performed without loss of energy. Fig. 33 shows a pair of diagrams from the two cylinders of a tandem Woolf engine, in which the steam passed as directly as possible from the small to the large cylinder. The diagrams are drawn to the same scale of <hi rend="italic">stroke <,hi> and therefore to different scales of <hi rend="italic">volume, <,hi> and the low-pressure diagram is turned round so that it may fit into the <,p>  high-pressure diagram. There is some drop at the high-pressure release, and, apart from this, there is a loss through friction of the passages, which shows itself by the admission line to the large cylinder lying below the exhaust line from the small one. <,p>  II8. Fig. 3I is a pair of diagrams taken from a compound tandem receiver engine running at 5O revolutions per minute, with cylinders 3O inches and 52 inches in diameter, and with a 6-feet stroke. The ratio of cylinder volumes is therefore 3 to I. The capacity of the receiver is nearly I,times that of the small cylinder. There is a comparatively early cut-off in both cylinders, and a nearly complete absence of drop. <,p>  The small cylinder, however, does more work than <,p>  the large one, in the ratio of nearly 3 to 2. <,p>  Fig. 35 shows the same pair of diagrams combined <,p>  by drawing both to the same scale of volume and of pressure, and by setting out each by an amount equal to the clearance space from the line of no volume. This makes the expansion curve in each diagram represent correctly the relation of the pressure to the absolute volume of the expanding steam. The broken line is a continuous curve of <hi rend="italic">adiabatic <,hi> expansion, drawn from the point of high-pressure cut-off, on the assumption that the steam then contained about 25 per cent. of condensed water. If the expansion were actually adiabatic, and if there were no loss in the transfer of the steam, the expansion curves for both cylinders would fall into this <,p>  line. <,p>  II9. Fig. 36 exhibits, in the same manner as fig. 35, a set of diagrams taken by Mr Kirk from the triple expansion engines of the S.S. “Aberdeen.” Each diagram is set out from the line of no volume by a distance which represents the clearance in the corresponding cylinder. The boiler pressure is I25 lb per square inch. The cylinders are 32 inches, 46 inches, and 7O inches in diameter, and the stroke is 4,feet. The cranks make I2O° with each other. The means of the diagrams for the two ends of each cylinder have been used in drawing this and the next figure, a practice which should be followed in drawing combined diagrams of the kind here ex <,p>  emplified. <,p>  I2O.

In the absence of data regarding the wetness of the steam this assumption may be considered fair. <,p>  I22. Lastly, fig. 38 shows a pair of diagrams, treated in the same manner, for a two-cylinder compound engine with cranks at right angles to each other, the high-pressure crank being 9O° in advance. During the back stroke of the high-pressure piston there is at first compression into the receiver until the large cylinder opens ; the high-pressure diagram consequently takes a peculiar form, which should be compared with the diagram already given for a tandem engine (§ II8). In this example there is a considerable amount of drop and also of loss between the two cylinders. <,p>  VII. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Production of Steam.—Boilers. <,hi> <,p>  I23. The first step in the production of steam is to convert the potential energy of fuel into actual heat ; the second step is to transfer the heat to water in the boiler. The efficiency of furnace and boiler is the ratio which the amount of heat taken up by the water bears to the whole potential energy of the fuel. In good boilers this efficiency is about O·7. The loss is due partly to incomplete combustion of the fuel and partly to incomplete transfer of heat from the products of combustion to the boiler water. Under the first head may be classed—(I) waste of fuel in the solid state by bad stoking, and (2) waste of fuel in the gaseous and smoky states by imperfect combustion. Under the second head are comprised—(I) waste by external radiation and conduction, and (2) waste by heat contained in the hot gases which escape by the chimney, due <hi rend="italic">(a) <,hi> to their still high temperature and (<hi rend="italic">b <,hi> ) to the fact that they contain as one of the products of combustion steam-gas which passes away uncondensed. Loss of heat by the hot gases is the most important source of waste. Not only are the actual products of combustion rejected at a high temperature, but along with them goes the nitrogen of the air whose oxygen has been used, and also a quantity of additional air which is needed to dilute the products in order that combustion may be fairly complete. Roughly speaking, about I2 lb of air are required to supply oxygen enough for the combustion of I lb of coal. Over and above this quantity, about I2 lb more generally pass through the furnace as air of dilution. In furnaces with forced draught, in which the consumption of coal per square foot of grate surface is much more rapid, the air of dilution may be reduced to half or less than half of this quantity, though to some extent at the expense of completeness in the combustion. <,p>  I24. The extent to which heat is taken from the hot gases depends on the <hi rend="italic">heating surface <,hi> through which heat passes into the water. The heating surface is made up of the surface of the furnace or combustion-chamber, so far as that is brought into contact with the water, and of the flues or tubes through which the hot gases pass on their way to the chimney. Its efficiency depends on the conductivity of the metal, on the difference in temperature between the gases on one side and the water on the other, and on the freedom with which steam, when formed, can escape from the surface. Differences in specific conductivity and in thickness of metal affect the result less than might be expected, on account of the resistance which is offered to the passage of heat through the film of scale and also through the film of water vapour which forms on the metallic surface. <,p>  By extending the heating surface sufficiently the hot gases may be deprived of heat to an extent which is only limited by the temperature of the boiler water. This temperature, however, need not form a limit, for after leaving the boiler the gases may be further cooled by being brought into contact with a vessel termed a feed-water heater, through whieh the feed-water passes on its way to the boiler. Even with a feed-water heater, however, the temperature of the hot gases is never, in practice, reduced so low as that of the boiler. <,p>  I25. In nearly all land engines and most marine engines the draught is produced by means of a chimney, which acts in virtue of the column of air within it being specifically lighter than the air outside, so that the pressure within the chimney at its base is less than the atmospheric pressure at the same level outside. The composition of tire chimney gases is such that they are heavier than air at the same temperature, and to make them sufficiently lighter to cause a draught they must retain a certain considerable portion of their heat. On the other hand, if they are left too hot the mass of air drawn through the furnace is actually diminished, since then the chimney gases are so much expanded that the increased volume of the draught does not compensate for its diminished density. With a given chimney and furnace the maximum draught is obtained when the gases escape at a temperature about that of melting lead ; by making the chimney more capacious a lower temperature will suffice to give the same draught, and this will of course increase the efficiency of the boiler. <,p>  I26. In place of using a chimney draught depending merely on the temperature of the rejected hot gases, the air required for combustion and dilution may be forced through the furnace either by producing a partial vacuum in the chimney or by supplying air to the grate at a pressure higher than that of the atmosphere. In <,p>  locomotives, for example, a partial vacuum is produced in the chimney by means of a blast of exhaust steam from the engine ; aud in many naval and a few mercantile steamers a forced draught is produced by having a closed stokehole or a closed ashpit, whieh is supplied with air at a pressure above that of the atmosphere by the use of a blowing fan. <,p>  If heat were thoroughly extracted from the products of combustion, a forced draught would be more efficient, from the thermodynamic point of view, than a chimney draught, for a chimney is in fact an extremely inefficient heat-engine, and requires a very large amount of heat to be expended in order to effect the comparatively trifling work of maintaining the draught. But where forced draught has been substituted for chimney draught this has hitherto been done for the purpose of increasing not the efficiency but the <hi rend="italic">power <,hi> of boilers. The motive has been to burn more coal per square foot of grate surface and so to evaporate more water with a boiler of given weight. This is incompatible with very high efficiency. When more coal is burnt by forcing the draught it is true that the products of combustion have a higher temperature (since less air is required for dilution) and the effectiveness of the heating surface is therefore increased. But the heating surface has more hot gas to deal with, and the result is that the boiler is less efficient than when the draught is not forced. The same efficiency could be secured, with forced draught, by increasing the heating surface to a sufficient extent ; and a still greater efficiency could be realized if the heating surface were still further enlarged so that the gases left the flues at a temperature lower than would be needful if the draught depended on the lightness of the chimney’s contents. The most efficient boiler would be one in which the draught was forced by mechanical means, and the gases were then cooled as far as possible by contact with a very extensive heating surface, first in the boiler itself and then in a feed-water heater. None of the forced draught boilers that have hitherto been introduced have a heating surface so large as to make them more efficient than good chimney-draught boilers (in which the rate of combustion is much slower), although the heating surface bears a much larger ratio to the grate area than is usual with chimney draughts. <,p>  I27. Most modern boilers are internally fired ; that is to say, the furnaces are more or less completely enclosed within the boiler. Externally fired boilers are for the most part much less efficient than internally fired boilers ; they are, however, used to a considerable extent where fuel is specially cheap or where the waste heat of other furnaces is to be utilized. Their usual form is that of a horizontal cylinder with convex ends ; the strength both of the main shell and the ends is derived from their curvature, and no <,p>  staying is necessary. The heating surface is entirely external and is of very limited extent. <,p>  In large stationary boilers the forms known as the “ Lancashire ” (or double flue) and the “ Cornish” (or single flue) are most common. <,p>  Figs. 39 and <,p>  4O show in <,p>  section a Cor <,p>  nish boiler by <,p>  Messrs Gallo <,p>  way, and fig. <,p>  4I a Lanca <,p>  shire boiler by <,p>  the same mak <,p>  ers. In both <,p>  the shell is a <,p>  round horizon <,p>  tal cylinder <,p>  with flat ends. <,p>  In the Cornish <,p>  boiler there is <,p>  one internal <,p>  flue, at the <,p>  front end of <,p>  which is the furnace. The hot gases pass through the flue to the back ; they then return to the front end by two external side flues <,p</label>>

The arrangement in the Lancashire boiler is the same, except that there are two internal flues, each with its own furnace. The shell is made up of rings of riveted plates, larger and smaller in diameter alternately to <,p>  allow the circumferen <,p>  tial seams to be made <,p>  without bending the <,p>  edges. The flue is <,p>  made up of a series of <,p>  welded rings, joined <,p>  to each other by a <,p>  flanged joint with a <,p>  stiffening ring. This <,p>  form of joint was in <,p>  troduced by Mr Adam <,p>  son to stiffen the flue <,p>  against collapse un <,p>  der external pressure. <,p>  Other joints, designed <,p>  with the same object, <,p>  are shown in figs. 42 <,p>  and 43. The grate is <,p>  made up of firebars, <,p>  sloping down towards the back, where they terminate at the “ bridge ” of fire-brick (C, fig. 39). Beyond the bridge the flue is crossed by a number of tapered “Galloway” tubes D, D, which increase the heating surface, promote circulation of the water, and stiffen the flue. The end plates are strengthened by gusset stays <,p>  E, E, riveted to them and to the circumference of the shell by means of angle-irons. The gusset-stays do not extend so far in as to the circumference of the flue (fig. 4O), in order that the end plates may retain enough flexibility to allow the flue to expand aud contract under change of temperature. To provide for unequal expansion is one of the most important points in the design of boilers ; when it is neglected the boiler is subjected to a racking action which induces leakage at joints and tends to rupture the plates. For this reason the flue is attached to the boiler shell at the ends only, so that it may be free to take an upward camber in consequence of the greater heating of the upper side. <,p>  Mild steel is now very generally used for boiler plates, being superior even to the best Yorkshire iron in the qualities of ductility and tensile strength. The following particulars refer to the Lancashire boiler of fig. 4I, which may be taken as representative of a large number of stationary boilers. <,p>  I28. The shell is 28 feet long and 7 feet in diameter, and is made up of 9 rings, each of two semi-cylindrical plates. The shell plates are <hi rend="superscript"> 3 <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> 8 <,hi> inch thick ; their edges are planed and fullered, and the rivet holes are drilled. The longitudinal seams, which break joint from ring to ring, are lap-joints double-riveted ; the circular seams are single-riveted. Each end plate is a solid piece of steel ⅜ inch thick ; the front plate is attached to the shell by riveting to an angle ring ; the back plate is flanged. The flues are each 2 feet 9 <hi rend="superscript"> I <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> <,p>  inches in diameter, made up of rings of steel <hi rend="superscript"> 3 <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> 8 <,hi> inch thick ; the longitudinal joints are welded and the circular joints are flanged and strengthened with stiffening rings. The flues are tapered somewhat at the back end to facilitate expansion, and are attached to the end plates by welded angle-rings. Each flue contains 5 Gallo <,p>  way tubes, tapering from IO <hi rend="superscript"> I <,hi> ,2 inches diameter at top to 5 <hi rend="superscript"> I <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> 2 <,hi> inches at bottom. On the top of the boiler is the manhole, covered with a cast-iron plate ; also a nozzle for the steam-pipe and two others for safety-valves. One of the safety-valves is connected with a float so that it opens if the water-level becomes too low. At the bottom, in front, is another nozzle for the blow-out tap ; and <,p>  in the front plate below the flues is another manhole. Feed-water is supplied by a pipe which enters through the front plate on one side, near the top of the water, and extends for a considerable dis <,p>  tance along the boiler, distributing the water by holes throughout the length. A pipe at the same level on the other side serves to collect scum. The fire doors are provided with sliding shutters by means of which the amount of air admitted above <,p>  the fire may be regulated. On the top of each fur <,p>  nace is fitted a fusible plug which melts if the <,p>  furnace crown becomes overheated. No separate steam dome is used ; the steam is collected by an "anti-priming ” pipe shown in fig. 44, which also <,p>  illustrates the stop- <,p>  valve by which the <,p>  delivery of steam <,p>  from the boiler is <,p>  started or stopped <,p>  at will. On the <,p>  front plate are a <,p>  pair of glass gauge- <,p>  tubes for showing <,p>  the water-level, and <,p>  a Bourdon pres <,p>  sure-gauge. This <,p>  last important fit <,p>  ting consists of a <,p>  bent tube of oval <,p>  section, one end of <,p>  which is closed and <,p>  free to move while <,p>  the other is open <,p>  to the steam and is <,p>  fixed. The pres <,p>  sure within the tube <,p>  tends to straighten <,p>  it, and the extent <,p>  to which this takes place is shown by a pointer which travels over a circular dial. A common lever safety-valve is shown in fig. 45. In other forms the valve is kept down by a weight directly applied to it, or by means of springs. Spring safety-valves are liable to the objection that when the valve opens <,p>  the load on it increases ; to remedy this, <,p>  forms have been proposed in which the <,p>  spring acts through a bent lever in such <,p>  a way that when the <,p>  strain on it increases <,p>  the leverage at <,p>  which it acts is re <,p>  duced. If the spring <,p>  is of reasonable <,p>  length, however, the <,p>  objection is not seri <,p>  ous. <,p>  I29. A modification of the Lancashire type — the “Galloway” boiler — is shown in sectional elevation in fig. 46. In it the two flues are joined beyond the bridge into a single flue, of the form shown in the figure, which is traversed by numerous Galloway tubes and is also fitted with water- pockets at its sides. <,p>  I3O. In other types of boiler an extensive heating surface is obtained by the use of a large number of small tubes through which the hot gases pass. This construction is universal in locomotive and marine boilers. It is applied in some instances to boilers of the ordinary cylindrical form by making small tubes take the place of that part of the flue or flues which lies behind the bridge, or by using small tubes as channels through which the gases return from back to front after passing through the main flue. Another form of tubular boiler is an externally fired horizontal cylinder fitted with tubes which carry the hot gases from the back to the front. <,p</label>>

Vertical boilers are extensively used in connexion with small engines. Examples are shown in figs. 47-49. Fig. 48 is an ordinary vertical boiler filled with cross tubes of the Galloway type. Fig. <,p>  47 (by Messrs Davey, Paxman, &amp;amp; Co.) is a boiler with curved water tubes, each of which has fitted in the top a loose cap whose function is to deflect the stream of water which circulates up the tubes. Fig. 49 is a form of multitubular boiler by the same makers, in which the hot gases escape at the side after passing from the smoke-box through horizontal tubes grouped in circular arcs. In all these boilers the grate is at the foot, and the fire-door is at a mouthpiece in the side of the boiler near the base. In other <,p>  forms of vertical boiler the heating surface is increased by water tubes (fig. 5O) which hang from the crown of the fire-box, closed at the lower end but fitted internally with smaller tubes which are open at the bottom. Water circulates down the inner tubes and up between them and the outer. Tubes of this kind (called Field tubes) are used in fire-engine boilers and in other cases where it is necessary to get up steam with the least possible delay. Vertical boilers of large size are sometimes used for utilizing the waste heat of iron furnaces. <,p>  I32. A great variety of boilers have been designed in which the firing is external, and the water space consists of groups of tubes or other small sections whose outer surface is exposed to heat. Boilers of this type are called sectional or tubulous boilers, in distinction to tubular boilers, or boilers with tubes in which the hot gases circulate. A successful example of the tubulous or sectional type is the Babcock &amp;amp; Wilcox water- tube boiler, which consists of a series of in- <,p>  on the inside of the shell plates. A sloping bridge of fire-brick partially separates the upper part of the fire-box from the lower and prevents the flame from striking the tubes too directly. Under the grate is an ashpan, to whieh the supply of air is regulated by a damper in front. The fire-door opens inwards, and can be set more or less open, to regulate the amount of air admitted above the fire. On top of the barrel is a steam-dome, from which tho steam supply is taken through a pipe S traversing the forward part of the steam space and passing down to the valve-chest through the smoke-box. The stop-valve or “regulator” R is situated in tho smoke-box, and is worked by a rod through the boiler from tho cab at the back. Above the fire-box end of the shell are a pair of Ramsbottom safety-valves, V, V—two valves pressed down by a single spring attached to the middle of a cross bar, which is prolonged to form a hand lever by which the valves may be lifted. In front of the forward tube-plate is the smoke-box, containing the blast-pipe B by which the exhaust steam is used to produce a partial vacuum and so force a draught through the furnace. <,p>  I34. Instead of stiffening the fire-box roof by the use of girder stays, the plan is sometimes followed of staying it directly to tho shell above. The outer shell above the fire-box is generally cylindrical ; but to facilitate this method of staying it is sometimes made flat. This construction is not unusual in American locomotive boilers, another feature of which is that the grate is made <,p>  clined welded tubes up which water circulates. These are joined at their ends by cast-iron connecting boxes to one another and to a horizontal drum on the top in which the mixture of steam and water which rises from the tube undergoes separation. At the lowest point of the boiler is another drum for tho collection of sediment. Root’s boiler is another in which water is heated by circulating through inclined tubes exposed to the fire ; it differs from the above form chiefly in having the water-level below the top of the tube. Harrison’s boiler is a group of small globular vessels of cast-iron strung like beads on rods which tie them together. Sectional boilers may be constructed without difficulty to bear pressures greatly in excess of those for which other types are suited. Mr Perkins has employed a tubulous boiler to deliver steam at a pressure of 5OO lb per square inch.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="19"> <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I877. See also a paper by Mr Flannery, “ Οn High- Pressure Steam Boilers,” <hi rend="italic">Min. Proc. Inst. C.E., <,hi> I878. <,note> The Herreshof boiler is a continuous coil of tube, arranged as a dome over the fire. Feedwater is pumped slowly through the coil, and turns to steam before it reaches the end. <,p>  I33. The locomotive boiler consists of a nearly rectangular firebox, enclosed above and on the sides by water, and a cylindrical part called the barrel extending horizontally from the fire-box to the front part of the locomotive and filled with numerous tubes. Figs. 5I and 52 show in longitudinal and transverse section a boiler of the London and North Western Railway, which may be taken as typical of modern English practice. <,p>  The barrel is IO feet long and a little more than 4 feet in diameter, and is made up of three rings of steel plates,,inch thick, arranged telescopically. It contains I98 brass tubes, each I,8 inches in external diameter. The front tube-plate in which the tubes terminate is of steel 3,inch thick ; it is stayed to the back tube-plate by the tubes themselves, and the upper part of the front tube-plate is also tied by longitudinal rods to the back end-plate. The fire-box is of copper,inch thick. It is nearly rectangular, with a horizontal grate. (A grate sloping down in front is often preferred.) Round its sides, front, and back (except w’here the fire-door interrupts) is a water space about 3 inches wido, which narrows slightly towards the bottom. The flat sides of the fire-box are tied to the flat sides of the shell by copper stay-bolts, 4 inches apart, which are secured by screwing them into both plates and riveting over the ends. The roof of the fire-box is stiffened by a number of girders on the top, to which the plates are secured by short bolts. The girders are themselves hung from the top of tho shell above them by slings which are secured to angle-irons riveted <,p>  much larger than in English practice, for the purpose of burning anthracite coal. An extreme instance is furnished by the Wooton engines of tho Philadelphia and Reading Railroad, which burn small coal of poor quality in a fire-box 9⅜ feet long by 8 feet wide, extending over the trailing wheels of the engine. In some cases the fire-box is divided by a sloping partition of plates with water between, which crosses tho fire-box diagonally from front to back and has in its centre an opening resembling a fire-door mouthpiece to allow the products of combustion to pass. In others the fire-bridge is supported by water tubes, and water tubes are also used as grate- bars. This is done rather to promote circulation of the water than to give heating surface. The practice of American and English locomotive engineers differs widely as regards the materials of construction. American shells are of mild steel, English shells gene- <,p</label>>

Proc. Inst. C.E., <,hi> I883. <,note> <,p>  The locomotive type of boiler is used for stationary engines of the portable, semi-portable, and semi fixed types, and also to a limited extent for marine engines in cases were lightness is of special advantage. <,p>  I35. So long as marine engines used steam of a pressure less than about 35 lb per square inch the marine boiler was generally a <,p>  chambers, and return tubes above the flues. In one variety, called the double-ended boiler, there are furnaces at both ends of the shell, each pair leading to a combustion-chamber in the centre that is common to both, or to separate central chambers with a water space between them. <,p>  Figs. 53 and 54 show with some completeness a double-ended marine boiler of the most modern construction for high-pressure steam. At each end there are three furnaces in flues made of welded corrugated steel plates. The use of corrugated plates for flues, introduced by Mr Fox, makes thin flues able to resist collapse, and allows the flues to accommodate themselves easily to changes of temperature. One combustion-chamber is common to each pair of furnaces. It is strengthened on the top by girder stays and on the sides by stay-bolts to the neighbouring chamber and to the shell. The tubes are of iron, and a certain number of them are fitted with nuts so that they serve as stays between the tube-plate of the combustion-chamber and the front of the boiler. The upper part of the front plate is tied to the opposite end of the boiler by long stays. The uptakes from both ends converge to the funnel base above the centre of the boiler’s length. The boiler shown is one of a pair, which lie side by side in the vessel, the uptake at each end being common to both. Each boiler has a steam-dome, from which the steam-pipe leads to the engine ; this consists of a small cylindrical vessel, with flat ends tied together by a central stay. Short pipes connect the dome near each end with the steam space of the main shell. The boilers of figs. 53 and 54, which are by Messrs Gourlay Brothers of Dundee, work at a pressure of I65 lb per square inch above the atmosphere, and are used with triple expansion engines. The shell is I2,feet in diameter, and I6,feet long. The plates are of mild steel I,inches thick round the shell and I inch in the ends. The tube plates are,inch and,inch thick, and the corrugated flues,inch. The longitudinal seams are treble- riveted, with inside and outside covering plates. The circumferential seams are lap-joints double-riveted. There are I27 tubes at each end, 46 of which are stay-tubes. The tubes are of iron, 3,inches in external diameter. Above these are I8 longitudinal steel <,p>  box with flat sides, elaborately stayed, with a row of internal furnaces near the bottom opening into a spacious combustion- chamber enclosed within the boiler at the back, and a set of return tubes leading from the upper part of the chamber to the front of the boiler, where the products of combustion entered the uptake and passed off to the funnel. The use of higher pressures has made this form entirely obsolete. The normal marine boiler is now a short circular horizontal cylinder of steel with flat ends, with internal furnaces in cylindrical flues, internal combustion- <,p>  stays 2,inches in diameter. The steam-dome is a cylinder 2⅜ feet in diameter and 8 feet long, stayed by a central 3,-inch rod of steel. The short fire-box stays are also of steel I,inches in diameter, of 7,inches pitch, and are secured by nuts and washers at both ends. The central combustion- chamber has a round <,p>  and unstayed roof. <,p>  The top of each side <,p>  combustion - chamber <,p>  is stayed by three <,p>  steel girders 8,inches <,p>  × 2,inches in sec <,p>  tion, secured by four <,p>  bolts to the roof- <,p>  plate below. A single- <,p>  ended marine boiler <,p>  by the same makers <,p>  is shown in fig. 55. <,p>  Boilers of this class <,p>  are in some instances <,p>  set athwartship in <,p>  stead of longitudin <,p>  ally, and bevelled on <,p>  the bottom, at the. <,p>  back, to accommo <,p>  date them to the <,p>  shape of the hull. A <,p>  modification of the <,p>  cylindrical form is <,p>  occasionally used, in <,p>  which the section is an oval, with round top and bottom and flat sides. The combustion-chambers are sometimes made with rounded tops, which are tied to the back plate by gusset-stays and angle- irons. In naval practice the tubes are frequently of Muntz metal in place of iron. Another form of boiler, used to a considerable Navy extent in the British navy, is a long horizontal cylinder with two type. <,p</label>>

The locomotive type of boiler has been successfully adapted to marine use by Mr Thornycroft aud others, especially for torpedo boats. This form gives much greater heating surface than others in proportion to its weight, and allows, especially when worked with forced draught, a large amount of power to be got from a small boiler. It is probable that, if any further rise is to occur in the steam pressure used in marine engines, comparable to that which has occurred during the last two or three years, the present normal marine boiler will give place to a form more nearly resembling the locomotive type. <,p>  I37. Boilers are usually fed either by a feed-pump driven by the engine, or by a distinct auxiliary engine called a “ donkey,” or by an injector. The <hi rend="italic">injector, <,hi> invented by the late M. Giffard, and now very generally used on locomotive and other boilers, is illustrated in fig. 56. Steam enters from the boiler at A and blows through an annular orifice B, the size of which <,p>  is regulated by the handle C. The <,p>  feed-water flows in at D, and meeting <,p>  the steam at B causes it to condense. <,p>  This produces a vacuum at B, and <,p>  consequently the water rushes in with <,p>  great velocity, and streams down <,p>  through the combining nozzle I, its <,p>  velocity being augmented by the im <,p>  pact of steam on the back of the <,p>  column. In the lower part of the <,p>  nozzle E the stream expands ; it there <,p>  fore loses velocity, and, by a well- <,p>  known hydrodynamic principle, gains <,p>  pressure, until at the bottom its pres <,p>  sure is so great that it enters the boiler <,p>  through a check-valve which opens <,p>  only in the direction of the stream. <,p>  The escape orifice F and the overflow <,p>  pipe G allow the injector to start into <,p>  action, by providing a channel through <,p>  which steam and water may escape be <,p>  fore the stream acquires enough energy <,p>  to force its way into the boiler. The <,p>  opening for admitting water between <,p>  D and B is regulated by the wheel H. <,p>  The <hi rend="italic">exhaust-steam injector <,hi> works by <,p>  steam from the exhaust of non-con <,p>  densing engines, instead of boiler <,p>  steam. The steam orifice is then <,p>  larger in proportion to the other parts, <,p>  and the steam supply more liberal. In <hi rend="italic">self-starting injectors <,hi> an arrangement is provided by which overflow will take place freely until the injector starts into action and then the openings are automatically adjusted to suit delivery into the boiler. One plan of doing this is to make the combining nozzle under the steam orifice in a piece which is free to slide in the outer casing. Until the injector starts it lies at some distance from the steam orifice, and allows free overflow ; but when the vacuum forms it rises, in consequence of pressure at the base. In self-adjusting injectors this rise of the combining nozzle is made use of to contract the water-way round the steam orifice. In another form of self-starting injector one side of the combining nozzle is in the form of a hinged flap, opening backwards to allow overflow, but closing up when a vacuum is formed and the injector starts into action.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="21"> See papers in <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I86O, I866, I884. <,note> Weir’s <hi rend="italic">hydrokineter <,hi> for large marine boilers is another apparatus in which the principle of the injector is made use of, with the object of promoting circulation of the water during the time steam is being raised. It consists of a series of nozzles, with water-inlets between them, through which water is drawn by means of a central jet of steam supplied from a donkey boiler. <,p>  I38. In stationary engine boilers the feed-water is frequently heated by the products of combustion before these reach the chimney, in what is virtually an extension of the boiler itself. Green’s economizer is a contrivance for this purpose, in which the water passes through tubes whose outer surface is exposed to the hot gases and kept clear of deposited soot by the continuous action of a mechanical scraper. In locomotives and other non- condensing engines a portion of the exhaust steam is frequently made use of to heat the feed-water. When an exhaust-steam injector is employed it serves the purpose of a feed-water heater as well as that of a feed-pump. Besides increasing the efficiency of the boiler by utilizing what would otherwise be waste heat, a feed-water heater has the advantage that by raising the temperature of the water it removes air, and also, in the case of hard water, causes lime and other substances held in solution to be <,p>  deposited in the heater instead of being carried into the boiler, where they would form scale. In Weir’s feed-heater for marine engines the temperature of the feed-water is raised to about 2OO° Fahr. by injecting steam from the intermediate receiver. <,p>  I39. In stationary and marine boilers the steam, after leaving the boiler, is frequently taken through a <hi rend="italic">separator, <,hi> the function of which is to separate the dry steam from particles of water held in suspension. Steam is led round a sharp corner, and the water particles thrown off by centrifugal force collect in a <hi rend="italic">trap <,hi> below, from which they are discharged by a pipe which is kept open so long as the trap contains water, but is closed by a valve at the foot when the trap is empty. Traps are also fitted in many cases to steam-pipes for the purpose of returning condensed water to the boiler. <,p>  I4O. To prevent corrosion in boilers it is very usual to introduce blocks of zinc in metallic connexion with the shell. These are set in the water space, preferably at places where corrosion has been found specially liable to occur. Their function is to set up a galvanic action, in which zinc plays the part of the negative element, and is dissolved while the metal of the shell is kept electro-positive. Otherwise there would be a tendency for difference of electric quality between different parts of the shell to set up galvanic actions between the parts themselves, by which some parts, being negative to others, would be attacked. The zinc raises the potential of the whole shell enough to make all parts positive. <,p>  I4I. Allusion has already been made to the system which is universal in locomotive boilers of forcing the draught by a blast of exhaust steam in the chimney. A jet of boiler steam is occasionally used in marine furnaces for the same purpose ; but of late years the system which has found most favour is to box in the stokehole and keep the air in it at a pressure of from I to 3 inches of water by the use of blowing fans. This system has been applied largely in naval practice, with the result that the power of the boiler is increased in the ratio of about 3 to 2, or even more, as compared with its power under chimney draught. The efficiency of the boiler is, in general, slightly but not very materially reduced. An ordinary marine boiler bums I6 to 2Olb of coal per hour per square foot of grate with natural draught, and 3O lb or more with forced draught. In torpedo-boat boilers of the locomotive type the consumption has in some cases been forced to more than IOO lb. <,p>  In Mr Howden’s system of forced draught the stokehole is open, and air is supplied by a blowing fan to a reservoir formed by enclosing the ashpit and also to another reservoir from which it gets access to the grate above and through the fire-door. On its way to the reservoir the air is heated by passing across a part of the uptake in which the hot gases from the furnace are led through tubes. This method of restoring to the furnace what would otherwise be waste heat forms an interesting alternative to the method of restoring heat to the boiler by passing the hot gases through a feed-water heater ; it is in fact an application to boiler furnaces of the regenerative principle alluded to in chap. II.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="21"> The methods and results of these systems of forcing draught are described in papers read before the Institution of Naval Architects, April I886. <,note> <,p>  I42. Many appliances have been devised for the mechanical supply of coal to boiler furnaces, but these have hitherto taken the place of hand-firing to only a very limited extent. In Juckes’s furnace the fire-bars are in short lengths, jointed by pins to form a continuous chain or web, which rests on rollers and is caused to travel slowly in the direction of the furnace’s length by pin-wheels round which the web is carried at the front and back. Coal is allowed to drop continually on the travelling grate from a hopper in front of the furnace. A more usual form of mechanical stoker is a reciprocating shovel or ram, supplied from a coal-hopper, which throws or pushes a small quantity of coal into the fire at each stroke. Along with this devices are employed for making the grate self-cleansing, by giving alternate fire-bars a rocking or sliding motion through a limited range. In Mr Crampton’s dust-fuel furnace the coal is ground to powder and fed by rollers into a pipe from which it is blown into the furnace by an air-blast. The mixture of fuel and air is so intimate that the excess of air required for dilution is only one-fifth of the amount required for combustion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="21"> <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I869. <,note> A similar advantage attends the use of gaseous fuel, and of liquid fuel that is blown into the furnace in the form of spray. <,p>  I43. The use of liquid fuel for boilers has of late acquired considerable importance in connexion with the discovery of crude petroleum, in large quantity, at Baku on the Caspian Sea. The petroleum refuse which is left after distilling paraffin from the crude oil forms an exceedingly cheap fuel, with a calorific value per lb about one-third greater than that of coal. It has now superseded coal in the steamers of the Caspian, and has been largely employed for locomotives in the south-eastern part of Bussia. The oil is injected in the form of spray near the foot of the fire-box by a steam jet arranged in such a way that air will be drawn into the furnace along with the petroleum. In the arrangement for burning petroleum used in Russian locomotives by Mr T. Urquhart the flame impinges on a structure of fire-brick, built in the fire-box <,p</label>>

In early steam-engines the distribution of steam was effected by means of conical valves, worked by tappets from a rod which hung from the beam. The slide-valve, the invention of which in the form now known as the long D-slide is credited to Murdoch, an assistant of Watt, came into general use with the introduction of locomotives, and is now employed, in one or other of many forms, in the great majority of engines. <,p>  The common or locomotive slide-valve is illustrated in fig. 57. The seat, or surface on which the valve slides, is a plane surface formed on or <,p>  fixed to the side of the <,p>  cylinder, with three <,p>  portsor openings, which <,p>  extend across the great <,p>  er part of the cylin <,p>  der’s width. The central opening is the exhaust-port through which the steam escapes ; the others, or steam ports, which are narrower, lead to the two <,p>  ends of the cylin <,p>  der respectively. <,p>  The valve is a <,p>  box-shaped cover <,p>  which slides over <,p>  the seat, and <,p>  the whole is en <,p>  closed in a cham <,p>  ber called the <,p>  valve - chest, to <,p>  which steam from <,p>  the boiler is ad <,p>  mitted. When <,p>  the valve moves a <,p>  sufficient distance <,p>  to either side of <,p>  the central posi <,p>  tion, steam enters <,p>  one end of the <,p>  cylinder from the <,p>  valve-chest and <,p>  escapes from the <,p>  other end of the <,p>  cylinder through <,p>  the cavity of the <,p>  valve into the exhaust-port. The valve is generally moved by an eccentric on the engine-shaft (fig. 58), which is mechanically equivalent to a crank whose radius is equal to the eccentricity, or distance of O, the centre of the shaft, from P, the centre of the eccentric sheave. The sheave is encircled by a strap forming the end of the eccentric rod, and the rod is connected by a pin-joint to the valve- rod, which comes out of the valve-chest through <,p>  a steam-tight stuffing-box. The eccentric rod <,p>  is generally so long that the motion of the <,p>  valve is sensibly the same as that which it <,p>  would receive were the rod infinitely long. <,p>  Thus if a circle (fig. 59) be drawn to represent <,p>  the path of the eccentric centre during a revolu <,p>  tion of the engine, and a perpendicular PM be <,p>  drawn from any point P on a diameter AB, <,p>  the distance CM is the displacement of the valve from its middle position at the time when the eccentric centre is at P. AB is the whole travel of the valve. <,p>  I45. If the valve when in its middle position did not overlap the steam ports (fig. 6O), any movement to the right or the left would admit steam, and the admission would continue until the valve had returned to its middle position, or, in other words, for half a revolution of <,p>  the engine. Such a <,p>  valve would not <,p>  serve for expansive <,p>  working, and as re <,p>  gards the relative po <,p>  sition of the crank <,p>  and eccentric it <,p>  would have to be <,p>  set so that its middle position coincided with the extreme position <,p>  of the piston ; in other words, the eccentric radius would make a right angle with the crank. Expansive working, however, becomes possible when we give the valve what is called “ lap,” by making it project over the edges of the steam ports, as in fig. 6I, where <hi rend="italic">o <,hi> is the “ outside lap ” and <hi rend="italic">i <,hi> is the “ inside lap. ” Admission of steam (to either side) then begins only when the displacement of the valve from its middle position exceeds the amount of the outside lap, aud continues only until the valve has returned to the same distance from its middle position. Further, exhaust begins only when the valve has moved past the middle by a distance equal to <hi rend="italic">i, <,hi> and continues until the valve has again returned to a distance <hi rend="italic">i <,hi> from its middle position. Thus on the diagram of the eccentric’s travel (fig. 62) we find, by setting off <hi rend="italic">o <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">i <,hi> <,p>  on the two sides of the centre, the posi <,p>  tions <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">cl <,hi> of the eccentric <,p>  radius at which the four events of ad <,p>  mission, cut-off, release, and compres <,p>  sion occur for one side of the piston. <,p>  As to the other side of the piston, it is <,p>  only necessary to set off <hi rend="italic">o <,hi> to the right <,p>  and <hi rend="italic">i <,hi> to the left of the centre, but for <,p>  the sake of clearness we may confine <,p>  our attention to one of the two sides. <,p>  Of the whole revolution, the part from <,p>  <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> to <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> is the arc of steam admission, <,p>  from <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> to c is the arc of expansion, <,p>  from <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> to <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> the arc of exhaust, and from <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> to <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> the arc of compression. The relation of these, however, to the piston’s motion is still undefined. If the eccentric were set in advance of the crank by an angle equal to AC <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> , the opening of the valve would be coincident with the beginning of the piston’s stroke. It is, however, desirable, in order to allow the steam free entry, that the valve be already some way open when the piston stroke begins, and thus the eccentric may be set to have a position C <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> ' at the beginning of the stroke. In that case the valve is open at the beginning of the stroke to the extent <hi rend="italic">mm', <,hi> which is called the “ lead.” The amount by which the angle between C <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> ' (the eccentric) and CA (the crank) exceeds a right angle is called the <hi rend="italic">angular advance, <,hi> this being the angle by which the eccentric is set in advance of the position it would occupy if the primitive arrangement without lap were adopted. The quantities lap, lead, and angular advance (ϕ) are connected by the equation <,p>  outside lap + lead=half travel × cos <hi rend="italic">θ. <,hi> <,p>  An effect of lead is to cause <hi rend="italic">preadmission, <,hi> that is to say, admission before the end of the back stroke, which, together with the compression of steam left in the cylinder when the exhaust port closes, produces the mechanical effect of “ cushioning, ” to which reference has already been made. To examine the distribution of steam throughout the piston’s stroke, we may now draw a circle to represent the path of the crank pin (fig. 63, where the dotted lines <,p>  have been added to show the assumed configuration of piston, connecting-rod, and crank) and transfer to it from the former diagram the angular positions <hi rend="italic">a, b, c, <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> at which the four events occur. To facilitate this transfer the diagrams of eccentric path and of crank-pin path may by a suitable choice of scales be drawn of the same actual size. Then by projecting these points on a diameter which represents the piston’s path, by circular arcs drawn with a radius equal to the length of the con <,p>  necting-rod, we find <hi rend="italic">p, <,hi> the position <,p>  of the piston at which admission <,p>  occurs during the back stroke, also <,p>  <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> and r, the position at cut-off and re <,p>  lease, during the stroke which takes <,p>  place in the direction of the arrow, <,p>  and <hi rend="italic">s, <,hi> the point at which compression <,p>  begins. It is obviously unnecessary <,p>  to draw the two circles of figs. 62 and <,p>  63 separately ; the single diagram <,p>  (fig. 64) contains the solution of the steam distribution with a slide-valve whose laps, travel, and angular advance are known, the same circle serving, on two scales, to show the motion of the crank and of the eccentric. <,p>  I46. A method of representing graphically the relations of valve and piston motion, sometimes convenient in dealing with valve- gears of a more complex character than the single eccentric, is to set off the valve’s and the piston’s simultaneous displacement at right angles to each other, as in fig. 65, the valve's motion being exaggerated by using a coarser scale for it than for that of the piston. The result is an oval curve, from which the events in the <,p</label>>

The graphic construction most usually employed in slide- valve investigations is the ingenious diagram published by Dr G. Zeuner in the <hi rend="italic">Civilingenieur <,hi> in I856.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="23"> Zeuner, <hi rend="italic">Treatise on Valve Gears, <,hi> transl. by M. Müller, I8G8. <,note> On the <,p>  line AB (fig. 66), which represents the travel <,p>  of the valve, let a pair of circles (called valve- <,p>  circles) be drawn, each with diameter equal <,p>  to the half travel. A radius vector CP, <,p>  drawn in the direction of the eccentric at any <,p>  instant, is cut by one of the circles at Q, so <,p>  that CQ represents the corresponding displace <,p>  ment of the valve from its middle position. <,p>  That this is so will be seen by drawing PM (as in fig. 59) and joining QB, when it is obvious that CQ = CM, which is the displacement of the valve. The line AB with the circles on it may now be turned back through an angle of 9O°+ θ (θ being the angular advance), so that the valve-circles take the position shown to a larger scale in fig. 67. This makes the direction of CQ (the <,p>  eccentric) coincide on the paper with the simultaneous direction of the crank, and hence to find the displacement of the valve at any position of the crank we have only to draw CQ in fig. 67 parallel to the crank, when CQ represents the displacement of the valve to the scale on which the diameter of each valve circle represents the half-travel of the valve. CQis the valve displacement at the beginning of the stroke shown by the arrow. Draw circular arcs <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">cd <,hi> with C as centre and with radii equal to the outside lap <hi rend="italic">o <,hi> and the inside lap <hi rend="italic">i <,hi> respectively.

In this diagram radii drawn from C mark the angular positions of the crank, and their intercepts by the valve circles determine the corresponding displacement of the valve. It remains to find the corresponding displacement of the piston. <,p>  For this Zeuner employs a supplementary graphic construction, shown <,p>  in fig. 68. Here <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> or <hi rend="italic">a'b <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> , <,hi> represents the connecting rod, and <hi rend="italic">bc <,hi> or <hi rend="italic">b'c <,hi> the crank. With centre <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> and radius <hi rend="italic">ac <,hi> a circle <hi rend="italic">ap <,hi> is drawn, and with centre <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> and radius <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> another circle <hi rend="italic">aq. <,hi> Then for any <,p>  position of the crank, as <hi rend="italic">cb', <,hi> the intercept <hi rend="italic">pq <,hi> between the circles is easily seen to be equal to <hi rend="italic">aa', <,hi> and is therefore the distance by which the piston has moved from its extreme position at the beginning of the stroke. In practice this diagram is combined with that of fig. 67, by drawing both about the same centre and using different scales for valve and piston travel. A radius vector drawn from the centre parallel to the crank in any position then shows the valve’s displacement from the valve’s middle position by the intercept CQ of fig. 67, and the piston’s displacement from the beginning of the piston’s motion by the intercept <hi rend="italic">pq <,hi> of fig. 68. <,p>  I49. In all the figures which have been sketched the events refer to the front end of the cylinder, that is the end nearest to the crank (see fig. 63). To determine the events of steam distribution at the back end, the lap circles shown by dotted lines in fig. 67 must also be drawn, <hi rend="italic">Ca <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> , <,hi> being the outside lap for the back end, and C <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> ' the inside lap. These laps are not necessarily equal to those at the other end of the valve. From fig. 65 it is obvious that, especially with a short connecting-rod, the cut-off and release occur earlier and the compression later at the front than at the back end if the laps are equal, and a more symmetrical steam distribution can be produced by making the inside lap greater and the outside lap less on the side which leads to the front end of the cylinder. On the other hand, an unsymmetrical distribution may be desirable, as in a vertical engine, where the weight of the piston assists the steam during the down-stroke and resists it during the up-stroke, and this may be secured by a suitable inequality in the laps. <,p>  I5O. By varying the ratio of the laps <hi rend="italic">o <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">i <,hi> to the travel of the valve, we produce effects on the steam distribution which are readily traced in the oval diagram of fig. 65 or in the other figures. Reduction of travel (which is equivalent to increase of both o and <hi rend="italic">i) <,hi> gives later preadmission, earlier cut-off, later release, and earlier compression ; the ratios of expansion and of compression are both increased. The effect of a change in the angular advance is more easily seen by reference to Zeuner’s diagram, which shows that to increase θ accelerates all the events and causes a slight increase in the ratio of expansion. <,p>  I5I. In designing a slide-valve the breadth of the steam ports in the direction of the valve’s motion is determined with reference to the volume of the exhaust steam to be discharged in a given time, the area of the ports being generally such that the mean velocity of the steam during discharge is less than IOO feet per second. The travel is made great enough to keep the cylinder port fully open during the greater part of the exhaust; for this purpose it is 2,or 3 times the breadth of the steam port. To facilitate the exit of steam the inside lap is always small, and is often wanting or even <hi rend="italic">negative. <,hi> During admission the steam port is rarely quite uncovered, especially if the outside lap is large and the travel moderate. Large travel has the advantage of giving freer ingress and egress of steam, <,p>  with more sharp <,p>  ly-defined cut <,p>  off, compression, <,p>  and release, but <,p>  this advantage <,p>  is secured at the <,p>  cost of more <,p>  work spent in <,p>  moving the <,p>  valve and more wear of the faces. To lessen the necessary travel without reducing the area of steam ports, double- and eveu treble- ported valves are often used. An example of a double-ported valve is shown in fig. 85. Fig. 69 shows the Trick valve, an ingenious device for the same purpose. <,p>  I52. The eccentric must stand in advance of the crank by the angle 9O° + θ, as in fig. 7O, where CK is the crank, and CE the corresponding position of the eccentric when the engine <,p>  is running in the direction of the arrow <hi rend="italic">a. <,hi> To set <,p>  the engine in gear to run in the opposite direction (<hi rend="italic">b <,hi> ) <,p>  it is only necessary to shift the eccentric into the <,p>  position CE', when it will still be 9O°+ O in advance <,p>  of the crank. In the older engines this reversal was <,p>  effected by temporarily disengaging tho eccentric-rod from the valve-rod, working the valve by hand until the crank turned back through an angle equal to ECE', the eccentric meanwhile remaining at rest, and then re-engaging the gear. The eccentric sheave, instead of being keyed to the shaft, was driven by a stop fixed to the shaft, which abutted on one or other of two shoulders projecting from the sheave. In some modern forms of reversing gear means are provided for turning the eccentric round on the shaft, but the arrangement known as the link-motion is now the most usual gear in locomotive, marine, winding, and other engines which require to be often and easily reversed. <,p>  I53.. In the link-motion two eccentrics are used, and the ends of their rods are connected by a link. In Stephenson’s link-motion— the earliest and still the most usual form—the link is a slotted bar or pair of bars curved to the same radius as the eccentric rods (fig. 7I), and capable of being shifted up or down by a suspension rod. <,p</label>>

This is the position of “full forward gear. ” In “ full backward gear, ” on the other hand, the <,p>  link is pulled up until the block is in nearly a line with the backward eccentric rod R'. The link-motion thus gives a ready means of reversing the engine,—but it does more than this. By setting the link in an intermediate position the valve receives a motion nearly the same as that which would be given by an eccentric of shorter radius and of greater angular advance, and the effect is to give a distribution of steam in which the cut-off is earlier than in full gear, and the expansion and compression are greater. In mid gear the steam distribution is such that scarcely any work is done in the cylinder. The movement of the link is effected by a hand lever, or by a screw, or (in large engines) by an auxiliary steam-engine. A usual arrangement of hand lever, sketched in fig. 7I, has given rise <,p>  to the phrase “ notching up,” to describe the setting of the link to give a greater degree of expansion. <,p>  I54. In Gooch’s link-motion (fig. 72) the link is not moved up <,p>  in shifting from forward to backward gear, but a radius rod between the valve-rod and the link (which is curved to suit this radius rod) is raised or lowered—a plan which has the advantage that the lead is the same in all gears. In Allan’s motion (fig. <,p>  73) the change of gear is effected partly by shifting <,p>  the link and partly by shifting a radius rod, and <,p>  the link is straight. <,p>  I55. The movement of a valve driven by a link-motion may be very fully and exactly analysed by drawing with the aid of a template the positions of the centre line of the link corresponding to a number of successive positions of the crank. Thus, in fig. 74, two circular arcs passing through <hi rend="italic">e <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">e <,hi> ' are drawn with E and E' as centres and the eccentric rods are radii. These are loci of two known points of the link, and a third locus is the circle <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> in which the point of suspension must lie. By placing on the paper a template of the link, with these three points marked on it, the position <,p>  of the link is readily found, and by repeating the process for other positions of the eccentrics a diagram of positions (fig. 74) is drawn for the assigned state of the gear. A line AB drawn across this diagram in the path of the valve’s travel determines the displacements of the valve, and enables the oval diagram to be drawn (as in fig. 65), which is shown to a larger scale in another part of fig. 74. The example refers to Stephenson’s link-motion in nearly full forward gear ; with obvious modification the same method may be used in the analysis of Gooch’s or Allan’s motion. The same diagram determines the amount of slotting or sliding motion of the black in the link. In a well-designed gear this sliding is reduced to a minimum for that position of the gear in which the engine runs most usually. In marine engines the suspension-rod is generally connected to the link at the end of the link next the forward eccentric, to reduce this sliding when the engine is in forward gear. A less laborious, but less accurate, solution of link-motion problems is reached by the use of what is called the equivalent eccentric—an imaginary eccentric, which would give the valve nearly the same motion as it gets from the joint action of the actual eccentrics. The following ride for finding the equivalent eccentric, in any state of gear, is due to Mr M'Farlane Gray:— <,p>  Connect the eccentric centres E and E' (fig. 75) by a circular arc <,p>  whose radius = <hi rend="superscript"> EE' × length of eccentric rod <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> 2 × <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> ee' <,hi> <,p>  Then, if the block is at any point B, take <,p>  EF such that EF : EE' : : <hi rend="italic">eB : ed. <,hi> CF then <,p>  represents the equivalent eccentric both in <,p>  radius and in angular position. If the rods of the link-motion are crossed instead of open,—an arrangement seldom used,—the arc EFE' is to be drawn convex towards C. <,p>  I56. Many forms of gear for reversing and for varying expansion have been devised with the object of escaping the use of two eccentrics, and of obtaining a more perfect distribution of steam than the link-motion can often be made to give. Hackworth’s gear, the parent of several others, has a single eccentric E (fig. 76) opposite the crank, with an eccentric-rod EQ, whose mean position is perpendicular to the travel of the valve. <,p>  The rod ends in a block Q, which slides on a fixed inclined guide-bar or link, and the valve-rod receives its motion through a connecting rod from an intermediate point P of the <,p>  eccentric-rod, the locus of <,p>  which is an ellipse. To <,p>  reverse the gear the guide- <,p>  bar is tilted over to the <,p>  position shown by the <,p>  dotted lines, and inter <,p>  mediate inclinations give <,p>  various degrees of expan <,p>  sion without altering the <,p>  lead. The steam distribu <,p>  tion is excellent, and the <,p>  cut-off is sharper than in <,p>  the usual link-motion, but an objection to the gear is the wear of the sliding-block and guide. In Bremme’s or Marshall’s form this objection is obviated with some loss of sym <,p>  metry in the valve’s motion by constraining the <,p>  motion of the point Q, not by a sliding-guide, but <,p>  a suspension-link, <,p>  which makes the <,p>  path of Q a circular <,p>  arc instead of a <,p>  straight line; to reverse <,p>  the gear the centre of sus <,p>  pension R of this link is <,p>  thrown over to the posi <,p>  tion R' (fig. 77). In the <,p>  example sketched P is <,p>  beyond Q, but P may be <,p>  between Q and the crank <,p>  (as in fig. 76), in which <,p>  case the eccentric is set <,p>  at I8O° from the crank. <,p>  This gear has been applied <,p>  in a number of marine <,p>  engines. In Joy’s gear, <,p>  which is extensively used <,p>  in locomotives, no eccen <,p>  tric is required ; and the <,p>  rod corresponding to the <,p>  eccentric rod in Hack- . . <,p>  worth’s gear receives its motion from a point in the connecting rod by the linkage shown in fig. 78, and is either suspended, as in Marshall’s form, by a rod whose suspension centre R is thrown over to reverse the motion, or constrained, as in Hackworth s, by a slot- guide whose inclination is reversed.

A discussion of Mr Joy’s and other arrangements will be found in <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I88O. Mr Kirk, Mr Bryce-Douglas, and others have designed forms which more or less resemble those mentioned in the text. <,note> A method of reversing with a common slide-valve, which is used in steam steering engines<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="24"> <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I867. <,note> and some others, is to supply steam to <,p>  what was (before reversal) the exhaust side of the valve and connect the exhaust to what was the steam side. This is done by means of a separate reversing valve through which the steam and exhaust pipes pass. <,p>  I57. When the distribution of steam is effected by the slide- valve alone the arc of the crank’s motion during which compression occurs is equal to the arc during which expansion occurs, and for this reason the slide-valve would give an excessive amount of compression if it were made to cut off the supply of steam earlier than about half-stroke. Hence, where an early cut-off is wanted it is necessary either to use an entirely different means of regulating the distribution of steam, or to supplement the slide-valve by another valve,—called an expansion-valve, usually driven by a separate eccentric,—whose function is to effect the cut-off, the other events being determined as usual by the slide-valve. Such expansion- valves belong generally to one or other of two types. In one the expansion-valve cuts off the supply of steam to the chest in which the main valve works. This may be done by a disk or double-beat valve (§ I63), as in the Proëll gear mentioned in § I75 below, or by a slide-valve working on a fixed seat (furnished with one or more ports), which forms the back or side of the main valve-chest. Valves of this last type are usually made in the “gridiron” or many-ported form to combine large steam-opening with small travel. Expansion-valves working in a fixed seat may be arranged so that the ports are either fully open (fig. 8O) or <,p>  closed (fig. 8I) when the valve is in its middle <,p>  position. In the latter case <,p>  the expansion-valve eccentric <,p>  is set in line with or oppo <,p>  site to the crank, if the en <,p>  gine is to run in either direction with the same grade of expansion. Cut-off then occurs at P, fig. 82, when the shaft has turned through an angle <hi rend="italic">φ <,hi> from the beginning of <,p>  the stroke. The expansion valve <,p>  reopens at Q, and the slide-valve <,p>  must therefore have enough lap to <,p>  cut off earlier than I8O° <hi rend="italic">-φ <,hi> from <,p>  the beginning of the stroke, in <,p>  order to prevent a second admis <,p>  sion of steam to the cylinder. In <,p>  the valve of fig. 8O the expansion <,p>  eccentric is set at right angles to the crank, if the action is to be the same in both directions. If not, these angles may be deviated <,p>  from, and in this way a more rapid travel at the instant of cut-off may be secured for one direction of running. <,p>  I58. The other and much commoner type of expansion-valve is one sliding on the back of the main slide-valve, which is provided with through ports which the expansion- <,p>  valve opens and closes. Fig. 83 shows one <,p>  form of this type. Here the resultant rela <,p>  tive motion of the expansion-valve and <,p>  main-valve has to be considered. If <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> a <,hi> and <,p>  <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> b <,hi> (fig. 84) are the eccentrics working the <,p>  main and expansion valves respectively, <,p>  then CR drawn equal and parallel to ME <,p>  is the <hi rend="italic">resultant <,hi> eccentric which determines <,p>  the motion of the expansion-valve rela <,p>  tively to the main-valve. Cut-off occurs at <,p>  Q, when the shaft has turned through an angle <hi rend="italic">φ, <,hi> which brings the resultant eccentric into the direction CQ and makes the relative displacement of the two valves equal to the distance <hi rend="italic">l. <,hi> Another form of this valve (corresponding to fig. 8I) cuts off steam at the inside edges of the expansion-slides. <,p>  I59. Expansion-valves furnish a convenient means of <hi rend="italic">varying <,hi> the expansion, which may be done by altering their lap, travel, or angular advance. Alteration of lap, or rather of the distance <hi rend="italic">l <,hi> in the figures, is often effected by having the expansion-valve in two parts (as in fig. 83) and holding them on one rod by right- and left- handed screws respectively ; by turning the valve-rod the parts are made to approach or recede from each other. In large valves the adjustment is more conveniently made by vary <,p>  ing the travel of the valve, which is done by con <,p>  necting it to its eccentric through a link which <,p>  serves as a lever of variable length. <,p>  I6O. To relieve the pressure of the valve on the seat, large slide-valves are generally fitted with a steam-tight ring, which excludes steam from the greater part of the back of the valve. The ring fits steam-tight into a recess in the cover of the steam- chest, and is pressed by springs against the back of the valve, which is planed smooth to slide under the ring. Fig. 85 shows a relief ring of this kind fitted on the back of a large double-ported slide-valve for a marine engine. Another plan is to fit the ring into a recess on the back of the valve, and let it slide on the inside of the steam-chest cover. Steam is thus excluded from the space within the ring, any steam that leaks in being allowed to escape to the condenser (or to the intermediate receiver when the arrangement is fitted to the high-pressure cylinder of a compound engine). A flexible diaphragm has also been used, instead of a recess, to hold the ring. <,p>  I6I. The pressure of valves on cylinder faces is still more completely obviated by making the back of the valve similar to its face, and <,p>  causing the back to slide in contact with the valve-chest cover, which has recesses corresponding to the cylinder ports. This arrangement is most perfectly carried out in the piston slide-valves now very largely used in the high-pressure cylinders of marine engines. The piston slide-valve may be described as a slide-valve <,p</label>>

The pistons are packed like ordinary cylinder pistons by metallic rings, and the ports are crossed here and there by diagonal bars to keep the rings from springing out as the valve moves over them. Figs. 86 and 87 show two forms of piston valve designed by Mr Kirk for the supply of high-pressure steam to large marine engines. P, P are the cylinder ports in each. <,p>  Fig. 85 illustrates an arrangement common in all heavy slide- valves whose travel is vertical—the <hi rend="italic">balance-piston, <,hi> which is pressed up by steam on its lower side and so equilibrates the weight of the valve, valve-rod, aud connected parts of <,p>  the mechanism. <,p>  I62. The slide-valve sometimes takes the form of a disk revolving or oscillating on a fixed seat, and sometimes of a rocking cylinder (fig. 88). This last kind of sliding motion is very usual in stationary engines fitted with the Corliss gear, which will be described in the next chapter, in which case four distinct rocking slides are commonly employed to effect the steam distribution, one giving admission and one giving exhaust at each end of the cylinder (see fig. I27). <,p>  I63. In many stationary engines <hi rend="italic">lift <,hi> or <hi rend="italic">disk <,hi> valves are used, worked by tappets, cams, or eccentrics. Lift valves are generally of the Cornish or double-beat type (fig. 89), in which equilibrium is secured by the use of two conical <,p>  faces which open or close together. <,p>  In Cornish pumping engines, <,p>  which retain the single action of <,p>  Watt’s early engine, three double <,p>  beat valves are used, as steam- <,p>  valve, equilibrium-valve, and ex <,p>  haust-valve respectively. These <,p>  are closed by tappets on a rod <,p>  moving with the beam, but are <,p>  opened by means of a device called <,p>  a cataract, which acts as follows. <,p>  The cataract is a small pump with <,p>  a weighted plunger, discharging <,p>  fluid through a stop-cock which can be adjusted by hand when it is desired to alter the speed of the engine. The weighted plunger is raised by a rod from the beam, but is free in its descent, so that it comes down at a rate depending on the extent to which the stopcock is opened. When it comes down a certain way it opens the steam and exhaust valves, by liberating catches which hold them closed; the “out-door ” stroke then begins and admission continues until the steam-valve is closed: this is done directly by the motion of the beam, which also, at a later point in the stroke, closes the exhaust. Then the equilibrium-valve is opened, and the “in-door” stroke takes place, during which the plunger of the cataract is raised. When it is completed, the piston pauses until the cataract causes the steam-valve to open and the next “out-door” stroke begins. By applying a cataract to the equilibrium-valve also, a pause is introduced at the end of the “ out-door ” stroke. Pauses have the advantage of giving the pump time to fill and of allowing the pump-valves to settle in their seats without shock. <,p>  IX. <hi rend="smallcaps">Governing. <,hi> <,p>  I64. To make an engine run steadily an almost continuous process of adjustment must go on, by which the amount of work done by the steam in the cylinder is adapted to the amount of external work demanded of the engine. Even in cases where the demand for work is sensibly uniform, fluctuations in boiler-pressure still make regulation necessary. Generally the process of government aims at regularity of speed; occasionally, however, it is some other condition of running that is maintained constant, as when an engine driving a dynamo-electric machine is governed by an electric regulator to give a constant difference of potential between the brushes. <,p>  The ordinary methods of regulating are either (<hi rend="italic">a <,hi> ) to alter the pressure at which steam is admitted by opening or closing more or less a throttle-valve between the boiler and the engine, or (<hi rend="italic">b <,hi> ) to alter the volume of steam admitted to the cylinder by varying the point of cut-off. The former plan was introduced by Watt and is still common, especially in small engines. From the point of view of heat economy it is wasteful, since the process of throttling is essentially irreversible, but this objection is to some extent lessened by the fact that the wire-drawing of steam dries or superheats it, and consequently reduces the condensation which it suffers on coming into contact with the chilled cylinder walls. On the other hand, to hasten the cut-off involves a gain rather than a loss of efficiency unless the ratio of expansion is already very great. The second plan of regulating is much to be preferred, especially when the engine is subject to large variations of load, and is very generally followed in stationary engines of the larger types. <,p>  I65. Within certain limits regulation by either plan can be <,p>  effected by hand, but for the finer adjustment of speed some form of automatic governor is necessary. Speed governors are commonly of the <hi rend="italic">centrifugal <,hi> type: a pair of masses revolving about a spindle which is driven by the engine are kept <,p>  from flying out by a certain controlling <,p>  force. When an increase of speed occurs <,p>  this controlling force is no longer able <,p>  to keep the masses revolving in their <,p>  former path ; they move out until the <,p>  controlling force is sufficiently increased, <,p>  and in moving out they act on the regu <,p>  lator of the engine, which may be a <,p>  throttle-valve or some form of automatic <,p>  expansion gear. In the conical pendu <,p>  lum governor of Watt (fig. 9O) the re <,p>  volving masses are balls attached to a <,p>  vertical spindle by links, and the con <,p>  trolling force is furnished by the weight <,p>  of the balls, which, in receding from the spindle, are obliged to rise. When the speed exceeds or falls short of its normal value they move out or in, and so raise or lower a collar C which is in connexion by a lever with the throttle-valve. The suspension-links may be hung from a cross-bar (figs. 94, 95) instead of being pivoted in the axis of the spindle. <,p>  I66. In a modified form of Watt’s governor, known as Porter’s, or the loaded governor, a supplementary controlling force is given by placing a weight on the sliding collar (fig. 9I). This is equivalent to increasing the <hi rend="italic">weight <,hi> of the balls without altering their <hi rend="italic">mass. <,hi> In other governors the controlling force is wholly or partly produced by springs. Fig. 92 shows a governor by Messrs Tangye in which the balls are controlled partly by their own weight and partly by a spring, the tension of which is regulated by turning the cap A. <,p>  I67. In whatever way the revolving masses are controlled, the controlling force may be treated as a force F acting on each ball in the direction of the radius towards the axis of revolution. Then, if M be the mass of the ball, <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> the number of revolutions per second, and <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> the radius of the ball’s path, the governor will revolve in equilibrium when F = 4π <hi rend="superscript"> 2 <,hi> <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> <hi rend="superscript"> 2 <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> M (in absolute units), or <,p>  <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> = <hi rend="superscript"> I <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> 2π <,hi> √ <hi rend="superscript"> F <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> M <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> r <,hi> <,p>  In order that the configuration of the governor should be stable, F must increase more rapidly than r, as the balls move outwards. In the simple conical pendulum governor, any of the three forms shown in figs. 93, 94, and 95, where the balls have no load to raise <,p>  but their own weight, the controlling force F is the resultant of T, the tension in the link, and M <hi rend="italic">g <,hi> , the weight of the ball (fig. 96). Let the height of the pendulum, that is, the distance above the plane of the balls of the point where the suspending-link, or the link produced, cuts the axis, be called <hi rend="italic">h. <,hi> Then F:M <hi rend="italic">g <,hi> ::r: <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> . Hence <,p>  F= <hi rend="superscript"> M <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> gr <,hi> , <hi rend="italic subscript"> h <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> = <hi rend="superscript"> I <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> 2π <,hi> √ <hi rend="italic superscript"> g <,hi> , <hi rend="italic subscript"> h <,hi> <,p>  Any change of <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> tends to produce a change of <hi rend="italic">h, <,hi> and, if the governor itself and the regulating mechanism attached to it were free <,p</label>>

If the boiler pressure or the demand for work is changed, a certain amount of permanent displacement of the balls is necessary to alter the steam supply, and the balls can retain their displaced position only by virtue of a permanent change in the speed. The maximum range of speed depends on that amount of change of <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> w'hich suffices to alter the configuration of the governor from the position which gives no steam-supply to the position which gives full steam-supply ; and the governor is said to be sensitive if this range is a small fraction of <hi rend="italic">n. <,hi> <,p>  I68. If the governor is loaded, let M' be the amount of the load per ball, and <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> the velocity ratio of the vertical movement of the load to the vertical movement of the ball. Then <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> M' <hi rend="italic">g <,hi> is the equivalent increase in the weight of each ball. The effect of the load is to increase the controlling force F from M <hi rend="italic">gr <,hi> ∕ <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> to (M + <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> M') <hi rend="italic">gr <,hi> ∕ <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> , and the speed at which the governor must now turn, to maintain any assigned height <hi rend="italic">h, <,hi> is <,p>  <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> =, <hi rend="subscript"> 2π <,hi> √ <hi rend="superscript"> (M+ <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> q <,hi> <hi rend="superscript"> M') <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> g <,hi> <hi rend="italic">, <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> M <,hi> <hi rend="subscript"> h <,hi> <,p>  The speed of the loaded governor must therefore be greater than th <hi rend="underline">at of an <,hi> unloaded governor of the same height in the ratio √(M + <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> M') to ∖∕M. <,p>  The sensibility is then the same as that of an unloaded governor of the same height <hi rend="italic">h, <,hi> but the loaded governor has an important advantage in another respect—namely, its <hi rend="italic">power <,hi> or capability of overcoming frictional resistance to a change of configuration. This quality in a governor is increased whenever the controlling force F is increased, whether by the addition of a load or by the use of springs. <,p>  For let <hi rend="italic">f <,hi> be the frictional resistance to be overcome per ball, resolved as a force resisting the displacement of each ball in the direction of the radius <hi rend="italic">r. <,hi> Then if <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> be the speed normal to any configuration this speed must change by a certain amount Δ <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> before friction is overcome and the balls begin to be displaced. The controlling force is now F <hi rend="italic">+f <,hi> when the balls are moving outwards, and F - <hi rend="italic">f <,hi> when the balls are moving inwards. Hence <,p>  n + Δn=, <hi rend="subscript"> 2π <,hi> √ <hi rend="superscript"> F+ <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> f <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> M <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> r <,hi> , <,p>  and n - Δn=, <hi rend="subscript"> 2π <,hi> √ <hi rend="superscript"> F- <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> f <,hi> , <hi rend="subscript"> M <,hi> <hi rend="italic subscript"> r <,hi> <hi rend="italic">. <,hi> <,p>  From this, if <hi rend="italic">Bn <,hi> be small compared with <hi rend="italic">n, <,hi> we have Δn∕n= <hi rend="italic">f <,hi> ∕2F. <,p>  Thus, when a given amount of frictional resistance is to be overcome before the governor can act, the limits within which this friction allows the speed to vary are less the greater is the controlling force F. A loaded governor is more powerful in this respect than an unloaded governor of the same configuration in the proportion in which F is greater—namely, as M + <hi rend="italic">q <,hi> M' is to M. A loaded governor may therefore have much lighter revolving masses without loss either of sensibility or of power. <,p>  I69. The same results are applicable to governors in which the controlling force is supplied by springs as well as by gravity, or by springs alone. To find tho configuration which the governor will assume at any particular speed, or the speed corresponding to a particular configuration, it is only necessary to determine the whole controlling force F per ball acting along the radius towards the axis for various values of <hi rend="italic">r. <,hi> Let a curve <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> (fig. 97) be drawn showing the relation of F to <hi rend="italic">r. <,hi> At any assigned <,p>  value of <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> set up an ordinate QC = 4π <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> M.

The point c, in which OC cuts the curve, de <,p>  termines the value of <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> at which the balls will <,p>  revolve at the assigned speed <hi rend="italic">n. <,hi> Or, if that is <,p>  given, and the value of <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> is to be found, the line Oc <,p>  produced will determine C, and then n= QC∕4π <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> M. <,p>  The sensibility of the governor is determined by <,p>  taking points <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> corresponding to full steam <,p>  and no steam respectively, and drawing lines through them to determine the corresponding values of QA and QB.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="25"> See a paper by Mr W. Hartnell, “ Οn Governing Engines by Regulating the Expansion,” <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I8S2. <,note> When the frictional resistance <hi rend="italic">f <,hi> is known, an additional pair of curves drawn above and below <hi rend="italic">ab, <,hi> with ordinates F + <hi rend="italic">f <,hi> and F - <hi rend="italic">f <,hi> respectively, serve to show the additional variations in speed which are caused by friction. The governor is stable throughout its whole range when the curve <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> has a steeper gradient than any line drawn from O to meet it. <,p>  I7O. By § I67 it is evident that, if, when the balls are displaced, the controlling force F changes proportionally to the radius <hi rend="italic">r, <,hi> the speed is constant. In other words, the equilibrium of the governor is then neutral; it can revolve in equilibrium at one, and only at one, speed. At this speed it assumes, indifferently, any one of its possible configurations. The slightest variation of speed drives it to the extremity of its range ; hence its sensibility is indefinitely <,p>  great. Such a governor is called <hi rend="italic">isochronous. <,hi> A gravity governor is isochronous when <hi rend="italic">h <,hi> is constant for all positions of the balls (since <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> ∞ √ <hi rend="italic superscript"> g <,hi> ∕ <hi rend="italic subscript"> h <,hi> ). This will be the case if the balls are constrained to move in a parabolic path (fig. 98), it being <,p>  a property of the parabola that the subnormal QM, which is <hi rend="italic">h, <,hi> is constant. A useful approximation to the same condition, through a limited range, is secured in Farcot’s governor by the device of hanging the balls by crossed links from the distant ends of a T piece (fig. 95). If each centre of suspension were at the centre of curvature of a parabolic arc which coincided with the actual circular locus of the balls at the position of normal speed, the governor would be sensibly isochronous at that speed ; by taking the centres of suspension rather nearer the axis, a suitable margin of stability is se <,p>  cured, but the governor is still nearly enough isochronous to be exceedingly sensitive.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="25"> See also a paper by Mr J. Head <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I87I. <,note> Where springs furnish the controlling force, an approach to isochronism can be secured by adjusting the initial tension of the springs, and this forms a convenient means of regulating the sensibility. Thus, in Mr Hartnell’s apparatus (fig. <,p>  99), where the balls move in a nearly horizontal direction, and gravity has little to do with the control, the governor can be made isochronous by screwing down the spring, so ∣ that the initial force exerted by the spring is to its increase by displacement of the balls as the initial radius of the balls’ path is to the increase of radius by displacement. <,p>  When the initial force is increased beyond this the governor becomes unstable. <,p>  In fig. 97 the condition of isochronism is secured when the line <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> coincides with a straight line through O. <,p>  I7I. In practice no governor can be absolutely isochronous. It is indispensable to leave a small margin of stability for the sake of preventing violent change in the supply of steam, especially when there is much frictional resistance to be overcome by the governor, or where the influence of the governor takes much time to be felt by the engine. An over-sensitive governor is liable to fall into a state of oscillation called <hi rend="italic">hunting. <,hi> When an alteration of speed begins to be felt, however readily the governor alters its form, the engine’s response is more or less delayed. If the governor acts by closing a throttle-valve, the engine has still a capacious valve-chest on which to draw for steam. If it acts by changing the cut-off, its opportunity is passed if the cut-off has already occurred, and the control only begins with the next stroke. This lagging of effect is specially felt in compound engines, where that portion of the steam which is already in the engine continues to do its work for nearly a whole revolution after passing beyond the governor’s control. The result of this storage of energy in an engine whose governor is too nearly isochronous is that, whenever the demand for power suddenly falls, the speed rises so much as to force the governor into a position of over-control, such that the supply of steam is no longer adequate to meet even the reduced demand for power. Then the speed slackens, and the same kind of excessive regulation is repeated in the opposite direction. A state of forced oscillation is consequently set up. The effect is aggravated by the momentum which the governor balls acquire in being displaced, and also, to a very great degree, by the friction of the governor and the regulating mechanism. Hunting is to be avoided by giving the governor a fair degree of stability, by reducing as far as possible the static frictional resistances, and by introducing a <hi rend="italic">viscous <,hi> resistance to the displacement of the governor, which prevents the displacement from occurring too suddenly, without affecting the ultimate position of equilibrium. For this purpose many governors are furnished with a <hi rend="italic">dash-pot, <,hi> which is an hydraulic or pneumatic brake, consisting of a piston connected to the governor, working loosely in a cylinder which is filled with oil or with air. <,p>  I72.

An example is shown in fig. IOO, which is the governor of the <,p>  Armington and Sims <,p>  engine referred to in <,p>  § I97 below. Another <,p>  example is furnished <,p>  by the governor of <,p>  Brotherhood’s engine <,p>  (§ 2O3, fig. I28). <,p>  I73. The throttle- <,p>  valve, as introduced <,p>  by Watt, was origin <,p>  ally a disk turning on <,p>  a transverse axis across <,p>  the centre of the steam- <,p>  pipe. It is now usually <,p>  a double - beat valve <,p>  (fig. 89) or a piston- <,p>  valve. When regula <,p>  tion is effected by <,p>  varying the cut-off, and <,p>  an expansion-valve of <,p>  the slide-valve type is used, the governor generally acts by changing the travel of the valve. Fig. 99 illustrates a common mode of doing <,p>  sion, and then, when the trip-action comes into play, it closes suddenly. The indicator diagram of a Corliss engine consequently has a nearly horizontal admission-line and a sharply defined cut-off. Generally the valves of Corliss engines are cylindrical plates turning in hollow cylindrical seats which extend across the width of the cylinder. Often, however, the admission-valves are of the disk or double-beat type, and spring into their seats when the trip-gear acts. Many forms of Corliss gear have been invented by Corliss himself and by others. One of these, the Spencer Inglis<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="26"> <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I868. <,note> trip-gear, by Messrs Hick, Hargreaves, &amp;amp; Co., is shown in figs. IOI and IO2. A wrist-plate A, which turns on a pin on the outside of the cylinder, receives a motion of oscillation from an eccentric. It opens the cylindrical rocking-valve B by pulling the link C, which consists of two parts, connected to each other by a pair of spring clips <hi rend="italic">a, a. <,hi> Between the clips there is a rocking-cam <hi rend="italic">b, <,hi> and as the link is pulled down this cam places itself more and more athwart the link, until at a certain point it forces the clips open. Then the upper part of the link springs back and allows the valve B to close by the action of a spring in the dash-pot D. When the wrist-plate makes its return stroke the clips re-engage the upper portion of the link C, and things are ready for the next stroke. The rocking-cam <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> has its position controlled by the governor <,p>  this, by giving the expansion-valve its motion from an eccentric-rod through a link, the throw of which is varied by the displacement of the governor balls. In fig. IOO, the governor acts on the main slide-valve of the engine (there being no separate expansion-valve), and the displacement of the revolving masses Μ, M changes both the throw and the angular advance of the eccentric, thereby producing a change in the steam supply similar to that produced by "notching up ” a link-motion. The eccentricity B is altered by the relative displacement of two parts C, D into which the eccentric sheave is divided. In other forms of automatic expansion-gear the lap of the valve is altered ; in others the governor acts by shifting the expansion-valve eccentric round on its shaft, and so changing its angular advance. <,p>  I74. In large stationary engines the most usual plan of automatically regulating the expansion is to employ some form of trip-gear, the earliest type of which was introduced in I849 by G. H. Corliss of Providence, U.S. In the Corliss system the valves which admit steam are distinct from the exhaust-valves. The latter are opened and closed by a reciprocating piece which takes its motion from an eccentric. The former are opened by a reciprocating piece, but are closed by springing back when released by a trip- or trigger-action.

A more recent form of gear by Mr Inglis is described in <hi rend="italic">Engineering, <,hi> vol. xl. p. 25I. <,note> <,p>  I75. Fig. IO3 shows a compact form of trip-gear by Dr Proëll. <,p>  A rocking-lever <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> is made to oscillate on a fixed pin through its centre by a connexion to the crosshead of the engine. When the end <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> rises, the <,p>  bell-crank lever <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> engages the lever <hi rend="italic">d, <,hi> and when <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> is depressed the lever <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> is forced down and the valve <hi rend="italic">e <,hi> is opened to admit steam to one end of the cylinder. As <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> continues moving down a point is reached at which the edge of <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> slips past the edge of <hi rend="italic">d, <,hi> and the valve is then forced to its seat by a spring in the dash-pot <hi rend="italic">f <,hi> . <,p>  This disengagement occurs early or late according to the position of the fulcrum piece <hi rend="italic">g, <,hi> on which the heel of the bell- crank <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> rests during the opening of the valve. <,p>  The position of <,p>  <hi rend="italic">g <,hi> is determined by the governor. A similar action, occurring at the other end of the rocking-bar <hi rend="italic">ab, <,hi> gives steam to the other end of the cylinder. In one form of Proëll’s gear both ends of <hi rend="italic">ab <,hi> act on the same steam-valve, which is then a separate expansion-valve fixed on the back of a chest in which an ordinary slide-valve works. <,p>  I76. In the ordinary form of centrifugal governor the position of the throttle-valve, or the expansion-link, or the Corliss trigger depends on the configuration of the governor, and is definite for each position of the balls. In disengagement governors, of which the governor A shown on the right-hand side in fig. IO4 is an example, any reduction of speed below <,p>  a certain value sets the regulating mechanism in motion, and the adjustment continues until the speed has been restored. Similarly a rise of speed above a certain value sets the regulating mechanism in motion in the other direction. If the spindle <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> (fig. IO4) is connected to the regulator so as to give more steam if it turns one way and less if it turns the other, the speed at which the engine will run in equilibrium must lie between narrow limits, since at any speed high enough to keep <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> in gear with <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> the supply of steam will go on being reduced, and at any speed low enough to bring c into gear with <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> the supply will go on being increased. This mode of governing, besides being sensibly isochronous, has the advantage that the power of the governor is not limited by the controlling force on the balls, since the governor acts by deflecting a portion of the power that is being developed by the engine to the work of moving the regulator. It is rarely applied to steam-engines, probably because its action is too <,p>  slow. This defect has been ingeniously remedied in the supplementary governor of Mr W. Knowles, who has combined a disengagement governor with one of the ordinary type in the manner shown in fig. IO4.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="27"> <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I884. <,note> Here the spindle <hi rend="italic">a, <,hi> driven by the supplementary or disengagement governor A, acts by lengthening the rod <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> which connects the ordinary governor B with the regulator. It does this by turning a coupling nut <hi rend="italic">e <,hi> which unites two parts of <hi rend="italic">d, <,hi> on which right- and left-handed screws are cut. Any sudden <,p>  fluctuation in speed is immediately responded to by the ordinary governor. Any more or less permanent change of load or of steam- pressure gives the supplementary governor time to act. It goes on adjusting the supply until the normal speed is restored, thereby converting the control of the ordinary governor, which is stable, and therefore not isochronous, into a control which is isochronous as regards all fluctuations of long period. The power of the combination is limited to that of the common governor B. <,p>  I77. Other governors which deserve to be classed as disengagement governors are those in which the displacement of the governor affects the regulator, not directly by a mechanical connexion, but by admitting steam or other fluid into what may be called a relay cylinder, whose piston acts on the regulator. In order that a governor of this class should work without hunting, the piston and valve of the relay cylinder should be connected by what is termed differential gear, the effect of which is that for each displacement of the valve by the governor the piston moves through a distance proportional to the displacement of the valve. An example of differential gear is shown in fig. IO5. Suppose that the rod <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> is connected with the governor <,p>  so that it is raised by an acceleration of the <,p>  engine’s speed. The rod <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> whieh leads from <,p>  the relay piston <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> to the regulator serves as a <,p>  fulcrum, and the valve-rod <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> is consequently <,p>  raised. This admits steam to the upper side <,p>  of the piston and depresses the piston, <,p>  which pulls down <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> with it, since the end <,p>  of <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> now serves as a fulcrum. Thus by <,p>  the downward movement of the piston the <,p>  valve is again restored to its middle posi <,p>  tion and the action of the regulator then <,p>  ceases until a new change of speed occurs. <,p>  A somewhat similar differential contriv <,p>  ance is used in steam-steering engines to <,p>  make the position of the rudder follow, <,p>  step by step, every movement of the hand- <,p>  wheel ;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="27"> See a paper by Mr J.

A spindle <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> driven by the engine drives a piece <,p>  <hi rend="italic">b <,hi> (whose rotation is resisted by a friction <,p>  brake) through the dynamometer coupling <,p>  <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> , consisting of a nest of bevel-wheels and <,p>  a loaded lever <hi rend="italic">d. <,hi> So long as the speed re <,p>  mains constant the rate at which work is <,p>  done on the brake is constant and the lever <,p>  <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> is steady.

The lever <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> works the <,p>  throttle-valve or other regulator, either directly or by a steam relay.

Inst. Mech Eng., <,hi> I873. <,note> governor, which has a fan directly geared to the engine, revolving in a case containing a fluid. The case is also free to turn, except that it is held back by a weight or spring and is connected to the regulator. So long as the speed of the fan is constant, the moment required to keep the case from turning does not vary, and consequently the position of the regulator remains unchanged. When the fan turns faster the moment increases, and the case has to follow it (acting on the regulator) until the spring which holds the case from turning is sufficiently extended, or the weight raised. The term “ dynamometric governor” is equally applicable to this form ; the power required to drive the fan is regulated by an absorption-dynamometer in the case instead of by a transmission-dynamometer between the engine and the fan. In Napier’s governor the case is fixed, and the reaction takes place between one turbine-fan which revolves with the engine and another close to it which is held from turning by a spring and is connected with the regulator. <,p>  I8O. Pump governors form another group closely related to the differential or dynamometric type. An engine may have its speed regulated by working a small pump which supplies a chamber from which water is allowed to escape by an orifice of constant size. When the engine quickens its speed water is pumped in faster than it can escape, and the accumulation of water in the chamber may be made to act on the regulator through a piston controlled by a spring or in other ways. This device has an obvious analogy to the cataract of the Cornish pumping-engine (§ I63), whieh has, however, the somewhat different purpose of introducing a regulated pause at the end of each stroke. The “differential valve-gear” invented by Mr H. Davey, and successfully applied by him to modern pumping-engines, combines the functions of the Cornish cataract with that of a hydraulic governor for regulating the expansion.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="28"> <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng, <,hi> I874. <,note> In this gear, which is shown dia- <,p>  gramatically in fig. IO7, the valve- <,p>  rod of the engine (<hi rend="italic">a <,hi> ) receives its <,p>  motion from a lever <hi rend="italic">b, <,hi> one end of <,p>  which (c) copies, on a reduced <,p>  scale, the motion of the engine <,p>  piston, while the other (<hi rend="italic">d <,hi> ), which <,p>  forms (so to speak) the fulcrum, <,p>  has its position regulated by at <,p>  tachment to a subsidiary piston- <,p>  rod, which is driven by steam in a <,p>  cylinder <hi rend="italic">e, <,hi> and is forced to travel <,p>  uniformly by a cataract <hi rend="italic">f <,hi> . The point of cut-off is determined by the rate at which the main piston overtakes the cataract piston, and consequently comes early with light loads and late with heavy loads. <,p>  I8I. The government of marine engines is peculiarly difficult on account of the sudden and violent fluctuations of load to which they are subjected by the alternate uncovering and submersion of the screw in a heavy sea. However rapidly the governor responds to increase of speed by closing the throttle-valve, an excess of work is still done by the steam in the valve-chest and in the high-pressure cylinder. To check the racing which results from this, it has been proposed to supplement the control which the throttle-valve on the steam-pipe exercises by throttling the exhaust or by spoiling the vacuum. Probably a better plan is that of Messrs Jenkins and Lee, who give supplementary regulation by causing the governor to open a shunt-valve which connects the top and bottom of the low- pressure cylinder, thus allowing a portion of the steam in it to pass the piston without doing work. In Dunlop’s pneumatic governor<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="28"> <hi rend="italic">Ibid., <,hi> I879. <,note> an attempt is made to anticipate the racing of the screw by causing the regulator to be acted on by the changes of pressure on a diaphragm which is connected by an air-pipe with an open vessel fixed under the stern of the ship. A plan has recently been introduced by Mr W. B. Thompson to prevent the racing of marine engines by working the valves from a lay shaft which is driven at a uniform speed by an entirely independent engine. So long as this lay shaft is not driven too fast the main engine is obliged to follow it; if the lay shaft is driven faster than the main engine can follow the main engine pauses so as to miss a stroke, and then goes on. Reversing the motion of the lay shaft reverses the main engine. <,p>  I82. In connexion with governors mention may be made of an apparatus introduced by Mr Moscrop to give a continuous record of fluctuations in the speed of engines.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="28"> <hi rend="superscript smallcaps"> @@@4 <,hi> <hi rend="italic">Ibid., <,hi> I884. <,note> It resembles a small centrifugal governor, but the displacement of the balls actuates, not a regulator, but a pencil which moves transversely on a ribbon of paper that is moved continuously by clockwork. The recorder responds so rapidly to changes of speed as to show not only the comparatively slow changes which occur from stroke to stroke, but also those short-period fluctuations between a maximum and <,p>  minimum, within the limits of each single stroke, which will be discussed in the next chapter. <,p>  X. <hi rend="smallcaps">The Work on the Crank-Shaft. <,hi> <,p>  I83. Besides those variations of speed which occur from stroke to stroke, which it is the business of the governor to check, there are variations within each single stroke over which the governor has of course no control. These are due to the varying rate at which work is done on the crank-shaft during its revolution. To limit them is the function of the fly-wheel, which acts by forming a reservoir of energy to be drawn upon during those parts of the revolution in which the work done on the shaft is less than the work done by the shaft, and to take up the surplus in those parts of the revolution in which the work done on the shaft is greater than the work done by it. This alternate storing and restoring of energy is accomplished by slight fluctuations of speed, whose range depends on the ratio which the alternate excess and defect of energy bears to the whole stock the fly-wheel holds in virtue of its motion. The effect of the fly-wheel may be studied by drawing a diagram of crank-effort, which shows the work done on the crank in the same way that the indicator diagram shows the work done on the piston. The same diagram serves another useful purpose in determining the twisting and bending stress in the crank. <,p>  I84. The diagram of crank-effort is best drawn by representing, in rectangular co-ordinates, the relation between the moment which the connecting-rod exerts to turn the crank and the angle turned through by the crank. When the angle is expressed in circular measure, the area of the diagram is the work done on the crank. <,p>  Neglecting friction, and supposing in the first place that the engine runs so slowly that the forces required for the acceleration of the moving masses are negligibly small, the moment of crank- effort is found by resolving the thrust P of the piston-rod into a <,p>  component Q along the connecting-rod and a component O normal to the surface of the guide (fig. IO8). The moment of crank- effort is <,p>  (rcosα ∖ <,p>  + ^^=^=τ)' <,p>  √i- rsιn⅛∕ <,p>  where CN is drawn perpendicular to the centre line or travel of the piston, <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> is the crank, <hi rend="italic">l <,hi> the connecting rod, and <hi rend="italic">α <,hi> the angle ACB which the crank makes with the centre line. A graphic determination of CN is the most convenient in practice, unless the connecting rod is so long that its obliquity is negligible, when the second term in <,p>  the above expres <,p>  sion vanishes. <,p>  Fig. IO9 shows <,p>  the diagram of <,p>  crank-effort de <,p>  termined in this <,p>  way for an engine <,p>  whose connect <,p>  ing-rod is 3, <,p>  times the length of its crank, and in which steam is cut off at half-stroke. The thrust P is determined from the indicator diagrams of fig. IO8 by taking the excess of the forward pressure on one side of the piston over the back pressure on the other side, and multiplying this effective pressure by the area of the piston. The area of the diagram of crank-effort is the work done per revolution. <,p>  I85. The friction of the piston in the cylinder and the piston- rod in the stuffing-box is easily allowed for, when it is known, by making a suitable deduction from P. Friction at the guides, at the crosshead, and at the crank-pin has the effect of making the stress at each of these places be inclined to the rubbing surfaces at an angle <hi rend="italic">φ, <,hi> the angle of repose, whose tangent is the coefficient of friction. Hence O, instead of being normal to the guide, is inclined at the angle <hi rend="italic">φ <,hi> in the direction which resists the piston’s motion (fig. IIO) ; and the thrust along the connecting-rod, instead of passing through the centre of each pin, is displaced far enough to make an angle <hi rend="italic">φ <,hi> with the radius at the point where it meets the pin’s surface. To satisfy this condition let a “friction-circle be drawn about the centre of each pin, with radius equal to <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> sin <hi rend="italic">φ, <,hi> <,p</label>>

Any line drawn tangent to this circle will make the angle <hi rend="italic">φ <,hi> with the radius of the pin at the surface of the pin. The thrust of the connecting-rod must be tangent to both <,p>  circles ; it is drawn as in fig. <,p>  IIO, so that it resists the rotation of the pins relatively to the rod. The direction of rotation of the pins is shown <,p>  by curved arrows in the figure, where the friction-circles are drawn to a greatly exaggerated scale. Finally, P (after allowing for the friction of piston-packing and stuffing-box) is resolved into Q, and Q·CM, the moment of Q on the shaft, is determined. This gives a diagram of crank-effort, correct so far as friction affects it, whose area is no longer equal to that of the indicator diagram. The difference, however, does not represent the whole work lost through friction of the mechanism, since the friction of the shaft itself, and of those parts of the engine which it drives, has still to be allowed for if the frictional efficiency of the engine as a whole is in question. <,p>  I86. The diagram of crank-effort is further modified when we take account of the inertia of the piston and connecting-rod. For the purpose of investigating the effects of inertia, we may assume that the crank is revolving at a sensibly uniform rate of <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> turns per second. Let M be the mass of the piston, piston-rod, and crosshead in pounds, and <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> its acceleration at any instant in feet per second per second. The force required to accelerate it is <hi rend="italic">Ma,g, <,hi> in pounds-weight, and this is to be deducted in estimating the effective value of P. The effect is to reduce P during the first part of the stroke and to increase it towards the end, thereby compensating to some extent for the variation which P undergoes in consequence of an early cut off. If the connecting-rod is so long that its obliquity may be neglected the piston has simple harmonic motion, and <,p>  <hi rend="italic">a= <,hi> -4π <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> <hi rend="italic">r <,hi> cosα =- <hi rend="italic">4π <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2 <,hi> <hi rend="italic">n <,hi> <hi rend="italic superscript"> 2 <,hi> <hi rend="italic">x, <,hi> <,p>  where <hi rend="italic">x <,hi> is the distance of the piston from its middle position.

Hence the force required for its acceleration is the resultant of three components—F, the force required for the linear acceleration <hi rend="italic">a <,hi> (which is the same as that of the piston); <,p>  F, the force required to cause angular acceleration about the crosshead; and F, the force towards the <,p>  centre of rotation, which depends on the angular velocity, and is equal and opposite to the so-called centrifugal force.

If, however, the friction at the crosshead and crank-pin is to be taken account of the whole group of forces acting on the rod must be considered as follows. Compound forces equal and opposite to F, F, and Finto a single force R (fig. II3), which may be called the resultant resistance to acceleration of the connecting- rod. If the weight of the rod is to be considered, let it also be taken <,p>  as a component in reckoning R, Then the rod may in any position be regarded as in equilibrium under the action of the forces Q, R, and S, where Q and S are the forces exerted on it by the crosshead and crank-pin respectively. These three forces meet in a point <hi rend="italic">p <,hi> in R, which is to be found by trial, the condition being that in the diagram of forces, fig. II4, after the triangle POQ has been drawn, and the force R set out, the force-line S shall be parallel to a line drawn from <hi rend="italic">p <,hi> tangent to the friction-circle of the crank-pin, as in fig. II3. When this condition has been satisfied by trial, the value of S, which is the thrust on the crank-pin, is determined, and S. CM is the moment of crank-effort. This method is due to the late Prof. Fleeming Jenkin, who has applied it with great generality to the determination of the frictional efficiency of machinery in two important papers,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="29"> <hi rend="italic">Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin., <,hi> vol. xxviii. p. I and p. 7O3. <,note> the second of which deals in detail with the dynamics of the steam-engine. Fig. II5, taken <,p>  from that paper, shows the diagram of crank-effort in a horizontal direct-acting engine,—the full line with friction, and the dotted line without friction,—the inertia of the piston and connecting rod being taken account of, as well as the weight of the latter. It exhibits well the influence which the inertia of the reciprocating parts has in equalizing the crank-effort in the case of an early cutoff. The cut-off is supposed to occur pretty sharply at about one- sixth of the stroke. The engine considered is of practical proportions, and makes four turns per second ; and the initial steam pressure is 5O lb per square inch. It appears from the diagram that, with a slightly higher speed, or with heavier rods, a better balance of crank-effort might be secured, especially as regards the stroke towards the <,p>  crank, which comes <,p>  first in the dia <,p>  gram; on the other <,p>  hand, by unduly <,p>  increasing the mass <,p>  of the reciprocat <,p>  ing pieces or their <,p>  speed the inequal <,p>  ity due to expan <,p>  sion would be over-corrected and a new inequality would come in. <,p>  I88. When two or more cranks act on the same shaft, the joint moment of crank-effort is found by combining the diagrams for the separate cranks, in the manner illustrated by fig. II6, which refers to the case of two cranks at right angles. <,p>  Another graphic method of exhibiting the variations of moment exerted on the crank-shaft during a revolution is to draw a circular diagram of crank-effort, in which lines proportional to the moment are set off radially from a circular line which represents the zero of moment. An example of this plan is given in fig. II7, which shows the resultant moment determined by Mr A. C. Kirk for one of his triple-expansion engines with three cranks set at I2O° from each other. Curves are drawn for various speeds, giving in each case the resultant moment due to the steam pressure (as <,p</label>>

The line marked O is the steam line without inertia—or, in other words, <,p>  the curve corresponding to an indefinitely slow speed. The other curves refer to the number of revolutions per minute marked on them. <,p>  I89. To determine the fluctuations of speed during a revolution, the resultant diagram of work done <hi rend="italic">on <,hi> the crank-shaft is to be compared with a similar diagram drawn to show the work done <hi rend="italic">by <,hi> the shaft in overcoming its own friction, and in overcoming the resistance of the mechanism which it drives. In general the resistance may be taken as constant, and the diagram of effort exerted by the crank-shaft is then a straight line, as EFGHIJKL in fig. II8. At F, G, H, T, J, and K the rate at which work is being done on and by <,p>  the shaft is the <,p>  same ; hence at <,p>  these points the <,p>  fly - wheel is <,p>  neither gaining <,p>  nor losing speed. <,p>  The shaded area <,p>  above FG is an <,p>  excess of work <,p>  done on the crank, and raises the speed of the fly-wheel from a minimum at F to a maximum at G. From G to H the fly-wheel supplies the defect of energy shown by the shaded area below GH, by which the demand for work exceeds the supply ; its speed again reaches a minimum at H, and again a maximum at I. The excesses and defects balance in each revolution if the engine is making a constant number of turns per second. In what follows it is assumed that they are only a small fraction of the whole energy held by the fly-wheel. <,p>  Let ∆E be the greatest single amount of energy which the flywheel has to give out or absorb, as determined by measuring the shaded areas of the diagram ; and let ωand ωbe the maximum and minimum values of the wheel’s angular velocity, which occur at the extremes of the period during which it is storing or supplying the energy ∆E.

The former is due to insufficient fly-wheel energy, the latter to imperfect governing. <,p>  I9O. An interesting consequence of the periodic alternations in crank-effort which occur in each revolution has been pointed out by Mr M. Longridge.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="30"> <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> May I884, p. I63. <,note> The fly-wheel receives its alternate acceleration and retardation through changes of the torsional stress in the shaft. If these occur at intervals nearly equal to the period of free torsional vibration which the fly-wheel possesses in virtue of the torsional elasticity of the shaft between it and the crank, strains of great amplitude will arise ; and Mr Longridge has suggested that this may account for the observed fact that engine- shafts have been ruptured when running so that the fluctuations of crank-effort occurred with one particular frequency, although the greatest effort was itself much less than the shaft would safely bear. <,p>  XI. <hi rend="smallcaps">Examples of Steam-Engines. <,hi> <,p>  <hi rend="smallcaps">Stationary Engines. <,hi> <,p>  I9I. In classifying engines with regard to their general arrangement of parts and mode of working, account has to be taken of a considerable number of independent characteristics. We have, first, a general division into <hi rend="italic">condensing <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">non-condensing engines, <,hi> with a subdivision of the condensing class into those which act by surface condensation and those which use injection. Next there is the division into <hi rend="italic">compound <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">non-compound, <,hi> with a further classification of the former as double-, triple-, or quadruple-expansion engines. Again, engines may be classed as <hi rend="italic">single <,hi> or <hi rend="italic">double-acting, <,hi> according as the steam acts on one or alternately on both sides of the piston. Again, a few engines—such as steam-hammers and certain kinds of steam-pumps—are <hi rend="italic">non-rotative, <,hi> that is to say, the reciprocating motion of the piston does work simply on a reciprocating piece ; but generally an engine does work on a continuously revolving shaft, and is termed <hi rend="italic">rotative. <,hi> In most cases the crank-pin of the revolving shaft is connected directly with the piston-rod by a connecting-rod, and the engine is then said to be <hi rend="italic">direct-acting ; <,hi> in other cases, of which the ordinary beam-engine is the most important example, a lever is interposed between the piston and the connecting-rod. The same distinction applies to non-rotative pumping engines, in some of which the piston acts directly on the pump-rod, while in others it acts through a beam. The position of the cylinder is another element of classification, giving <hi rend="italic">horizontal, vertical, <,hi> and <hi rend="italic">inclined cylinder <,hi> engines. Many vertical engines are further distinguished as belonging to the <hi rend="italic">inverted cylinder <,hi> class ; that is to say, the cylinder is above the connecting- rod and crank. In <hi rend="italic">oscillating cylinder engines <,hi> the connecting-rod is dispensed with ; the piston-rod works on the crank-pin, and the cylinder oscillates on trunnions to allow the piston-rod to follow the crank-pin round its circular path. In <hi rend="italic">trunk engines <,hi> the piston-rod is dispensed with ; the connecting-rod extends as far as the piston, to which it is jointed, and a trunk or tubular extension of the piston, through the cylinder cover, gives room for the rod to oscillate. In <hi rend="italic">rotary <,hi> engines there is no piston in the ordinary sense ; the steam does work on a revolving piece, and the necessity is thus avoided of afterwards converting reciprocating into rotary motion. <,p>  I92. In the single-acting atmospheric engine of Newcomen the beam was a necessary feature; the use of water-packing for the piston required that the piston should move down in the working stroke, and a beam was needed to let the counterpoise pull the piston up. Watt’s improvements made the beam no longer necessary ; and in one of the forms he designed it was discarded—namely, in the form of pumping-engine known as the Bull engine, in which a vertical inverted cylinder stands over and acts directly on the pump-rod. But the beam type was generally <,p</label>>

The beam formed a convenient driver for pump-rods and valve- rods ; and the parallel motion invented by Watt as a means of guiding the piston-rod, which could easily be applied to a beam-engine, was, in the early days of engine- building, an easier thing to construct than the plane surfaces which are the natural guides of the piston-rod in a direct-acting engine. In modern practice the direct- acting type has to a very great extent displaced the beam type. For mill-driving and the general purposes of a rotative engine the beam type is now rarely chosen. In pumping engines it is more common, but even there the tendency is to use direct-acting forms. <,p>  I93. The only distinctive feature of beam-engines requiring special notice here is the “ parallel motion,” an ordinary form of which is shown diagram <,p>  matically in fig. II9. There MN <,p>  is the path in which the piston- <,p>  rod head, or crosshead, as it is <,p>  often called, is to be guided. <,p>  ABC is the middle line of half <,p>  the beam, C being the fixed centre <,p>  about which the beam oscillates. <,p>  A link BD connects a point in the beam with a radius link ED, which oscillates about a fixed centre at E. A point P in BD, taken so that BP : DP : : EN : CM, moves in a path which coincides very closely with the straight line MPN. Any other point F in the line CP or CP produced <,p>  below it, the guiding surfaces at Q are avoided, but the path of P is then only very nearly straight. An example of the linkage in this form, with the further modification that A is shifted out, and B is brought nearer to P, occurs in the pumping engine of fig. I3O below. <,p>  In by far the greater number of modern steam-engines the crosshead is guided by a block sliding on planed surfaces. In many beam-engines, even, this plan of guiding the piston has taken the place of the parallel motion. <,p>  is made to copy this motion by means of the links AF and FG, parallel to BD and AC. In the ordinary application of the parallel motion a point such as F is the point of attachment of the piston-rod, and P is used to drive a pump-rod. Other points in the line CP produced are occasionally made use of, by adding other links parallel to AC and BD.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="31"> The kinematics of the parallel motion are discussed in Rankine’s <hi rend="italic">Machinery and Mill Wark, <,hi> p. 275, aud rules are given for the proportions and positions of the parts. <,note> <,p>  Watt’s linkage gives no more than an approximation to straight-line motion, but in a well-designed example the amount of deviation need not exceed one four-thousandth of the length of stroke. It was for long believed that the production of an exact straight-line motion by pure linkage was impossible, until the problem was solved by the invention of the Peaucellier cell.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="31"> See Kempe’s <hi rend="italic">How to Draw a Straight Line <,hi> (“Nature Series,"), I877. <,note> The Peaucellier linkage has not been applied to the steam-engine, except in isolated cases. <,p>  I94. Another “ parallel motion ” which has been used in steam-engines is shown in fig. I2O. AB is a link pivoted on a fixed centre at A, and connected to the middle of another link PQ, which is twice <,p>  the length of AB. Q is guided <,p>  to move in a straight line in the <,p>  direction of AQ. P then moves <,p>  in an exact straight line through <,p>  A. This is not a pure linkage, <,p>  since Q slides in a fixed guide, <,p>  but the distance through which <,p>  Q has to be guided is small compared with the stroke of P. If Q is guided to move in the arc of a circle of large radius, by using a radius rod from a fixed centre above or <,p>  I95. No type of steam-engine is so common as the horizontal direct-acting. A small engine of this type, made by Messrs Tangye, and rated as a IO-horse-power engine, is illustrated in figs. I2I to I24. It furnishes a good example of a very numerous class, and serves to illustrate the principal parts of a complete engine. Fig. I2I is a side elevation, fig. I22 a plan, fig.

I24 is a horizontal section through the cylinder, valve- chest, valve, stuffing-boxes, piston, and crosshead. The bedplate <,p>  is a single hollow casting, with two surfaces planed on it to serve as guides (see fig. I23). At one end the bedplate forms a pillow- block for the shaft, which has another main bearing independently supported beyond the fly-wheel. At the other end the bedplate is shaped so as to form the cylinder cover ; the cylinder is bolted to this and overhangs the bed. <,p>  The cylinder (of IO inches diameter and 2O inches stroke) consists of an internal “liner” of cast-iron, exactly bored, and fitted within an external cylindrical casting, of which the ports and sides of the valve-chest form part. The space between the liner and the external cylinder serves as a steam-jacket. The use of a separate liner within the main cylinder is now general in large engines. In the front cylinder cover there is a stuffing-box through which the piston-rod passes. The stuffing-box is kept steam-tight by a soft packing which is pressed in by a gland. In some instances the packing consists of metallic rings. The cylinder cover and gland are lined with a brass ring in the hole through which the piston-rod passes. The valve-rod is brought out of the valve- chest in the same way. The piston is a hollow casting into which the piston-rod is screwed and riveted over. It is packed by two split rings of cast-iron, which are sprung into recesses turned in the circumference of the piston. This mode of packing is used in locomotives and small engines. For large pistons the usual plan is to employ wider split rings, called floating rings, pressed against the sides of the cylinder, not by their own elasticity, but by separate springs behind them in the body of the piston ; they are held in place by a movable flange called a junk-ring on one face of the piston. One example of the packing of a large piston is shown in fig. I34. The crosshead consists of a steel centre-piece with a round boss, in which the piston-rod is secured by a cotter, and a forked front, where the end of the connecting-rod works on a pin. A pair of pins at top and bottom carry the steel shoes or sliding- blocks, whose distance from the centre is adjustable by nuts to take up wear. There is no crank ; the connecting-rod works on a pin fixed in a disk on the end of the shaft in front of the main bearing. The valve-rod, which is worked by an eccentric just behind the bearing, is extended through the end of the valve-chest, and forms the plunger of a feed-pump which is bolted to the end of the chest. Frequently the feed-pump is fixed at any convenient part of the bedplate, and is driven by a separate eccentric, and in some cases its plunger is connected directly to the crosshead. In the main bearing the shaft turns in gun-metal or phosphor-bronze blocks called brasses. In heavy engines these are generally lined with Babbit’s anti-friction metal or other soft alloy, and in many modern engines the brasses are entirely dispensed with, a lining of Babbit’s metal being let into the cast-iron surface of the bearing. When the brasses are in two pieces, the plane of division between them is chosen to be that in which the wear is likely to be least. A more satisfactory adjustment is possible when the brasses are in three or more pieces. <,p>  I96. When a condenser is used with a small horizontal engine it is usually placed behind the cylinder ; and the air-pump, which is <,p>  within the condenser, is a horizontal plunger or piston-pump worked by a “tail-rod”—that is, a continuation of the piston-rod past the piston and through the back cover of the cylinder. Figs. I25 and I26 show in section one of Messrs Tangye’s small condensers fitted with a double-acting air-pump to be driven by a tail-rod. The condenser proper is the chamber A, and into it the injection- <,p>  water streams continuously through perforations in the pipe B, which has a cock outside to regulate the supply. The pump draws condensed water down to the lower part of the vessel at either end alternately through the valves C, and forces it up thence through the valves D to a chamber E, from which the delivery-pipe leads out. The pump is a gun-metal piston working in a cylinder fitted with a gun-metal liner. The valves are flat india-rubber rings held down in the centre by a spring, which allows them to open by rising bodily, as well as by bending. <,p>  I97. The engine of figs. I2I-4 makes 85 revolutions per minute, and its mean piston speed is consequently about 28O feet per minute. In some special forms of small horizontal engine the design is adapted to a much more rapid reciprocation of the moving masses, and the piston speed is raised to a value seldom exceeded in the largest land engines, although still higher values are now common in marine practice. Experience shows that the weight of engines of any one type varies roughly as the piston area. Their power depends on the product of piston area, piston speed, and pressure ; and hence, so long as the pressures are similar, the ratio of power to weight is nearly proportional to piston speed. Cases present themselves in which it is desirable to make this ratio as great as possible; and, apart from this, an engine making a large number of revolutions per minute is a convenient motor for certain high-speed machines. <,p>  A good example of a small horizontal engine, specially designed by the symmetry and balance of its parts, by largeness of the bearing surfaces, and by very perfect lubrication, to stand the strains which are caused by high speed, is the Armington &amp;amp; Sims engine, made in America by the patentees and in England by Messrs Greenwood &amp;amp; Batley. The bedplate is symmetrical about the line of motion of the crosshead ; it supplies two very long main bearings for the shaft, at each end of which there is an overhung fly-wheel. The bearings have an adjustable side-block to take up wear. They are formed entirely of white-metal, cast on to the cast-iron pillow-blocks. In the middle are two disks, forming crank-cheeks, which are weighted opposite the crank-pin, so that they balance the pin and that part of the connecting-rod which may be treated as having its mass applied there. The crank-pin and the crosshead-pin are wide enough to give a large bearing area. The crosshead-block is a hollow bronze casting, giving an exceptionally large surface of contact with the guides. The valve is a piston-valve of the Trick type, which works sufficiently tight without packing. The valve-rod and eccentric-rod are connected through a block which slides on a fixed guide. The governor, which has been already illustrated in fig. IOO, is contained within one of the fly-wheels. An engine of this type, with a cylinder I2 inches in diameter and a stroke of I2 inches, makes 275 revolutions per minute, has a piston speed of 55O feet per minute, and indicates about 8O horse-power. Other good examples of high speed combined with double action are furnished by the Porter- Allen engine<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="32"> <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> I868. <,note> and by the very light engines which Mr Thorneycroft and others have introduced for driving fans to supply air to the closed stokeholes of torpedo-boats. In these a speed of IOOO revolutions per minute is made possible by the use of light reciprocating parts and large bearing surfaces. <,p>  I98. Fig. I27 shows a large non-compound horizontal Corliss engine for mill-driving, by Messrs Hick, Hargreaves, &amp;amp; Co. The cylinder is 34 inches in diameter, the stroke 8 feet, and the speed 45 revolutions per minute, giving a mean piston speed of 72O feet per minute. The cylinder is steam-jacketed round the barrel in the space between the liner and the outer cylinder, and also at the ends, which are cast hollow for this purpose. In large horizontal engines the weight of the piston tends to cause excessive wear on the lower side of the cylinder. In the example shown a part of the weight is borne by a tail-rod, ending in a block, which slides on a fixed guide behind the cylinder. To further diminish wear the piston is sometimes made much wider from front to back than the one shown here ; and the device is sometimes resorted to of giving the piston- rod “ camber”—that is to say, an upward curvature in the middle portion, which the weight of the piston reduces to straightness. Fig. I27 illustrates a common method of attaching the air-pump and condenser in large horizontal engines. The condenser is placed in a well in front of the cylinder, anti the air-pump, which is a vertical bucket-pump, is worked by a bell-crank lever, connected with the crosshead by a link. The fly-wheel of this engine is grooved for rope-gearing; it is cast in segments, which are bolted to one another and to the spokes, and the spokes are secured by cotters in tapered sockets in the nave. It is large and heavy, to suit the inequality of driving effort which is caused by the use of a single cylinder and a very early cut-off in engines of this class. To facilitate starting and valve-setting, mill engines are often provided with an auxiliary called a “barring” engine. The barring engine turns a toothed pinion, which gears into a toothed rim in the fly-wheel, and is contrived to fall automatically out of gear as soon as the main engine starts. <,p</label>>

When uniformity of driving effort or the absence of dead- points is specially important, two independent cylinders are often coupled to the same shaft by cranks at right angles to each other, an arrangement which allows the engine to be started readily from any position. The ordinary locomotive is an example of this form. Among fixed engines of the larger kind, <hi rend="italic">winding engines, <,hi> in which ease of starting, stopping, and reversing is essential, are very generally made by coupling a pair of horizontal cylinders, with cranks at right angles to each other, on opposite sides of the winding-drum, with the link-motion as the means of operating the valves. <,p>  2OO. Non-compound engines of so large a size as that of fig. I27 are comparatively uncommon. Horizontal engines of the larger class are generally compounded either (I) by having a high and a low pressure cylinder side by side, working on two cranks at exactly or nearly right angles to each other, or (2) by placing one cylinder behind the other, with the axes of both in the same straight line. The latter is called the <hi rend="italic">tandem <,hi> arrangement. In it one piston-rod is generally common to both cylinders ; occasionally, however, the piston-rods are distinct, and are connected to one another by a framing of parallel bars outside of the cylinders. Another con- <,p>  of compound engines, the cut-off is usually effected either by an expansion slide-valve or by some form of Corliss or other trip- gear. <,p>  For mill engines the compound tandem and compound coupled types are now the most usual, and the high-pressure cylinder is very generally fitted with Corliss gear. In the compound coupled arrangement the cylinders are on separate bedplates, and the flywheel is between the cranks. <,p>  2OI. The general arrangement of vertical engines differs little from that of horizontal engines. The cylinder is usually supported above the shaft by a cast-iron frame resembling an inverted A, whose sides are kept parallel for a part of their length to serve as guides for the crosshead. Sometimes one side of the frame only is used, and the engine is stiffened by a wrought-iron column between the cylinder and the base on the other side. <hi rend="italic">Wall-engines <,hi> are a vertical form with a flat frame or bedplate, which is made to be bolted against a wall ; in these the shaft is generally at the top. Vertical engines are compounded, like horizontal engines, either by coupling parallel cylinders to cranks at right angles (as in the ordinary marine form, which will be illustrated later, § 2I8), or, tandem fashion, by placing the high-pressure cylinder above the other. In vertical condensing engines the condenser is situated at the base, and the air-pump, which has a vertical stroke, is generally worked by a lever connected by a short link to the crosshead. In some cases the pump is horizontal, and is worked by a crank on the main shaft. <,p>  2O2. Engines making 4OO to I6OO revolutions per minute have been extensively applied, in recent years, to the driving of dynamos and other high-speed machines. These are for the most part single- <,p>  straction, rarely followed, is to have parallel cylinders with both piston-rods acting on one crank by being joined to opposite ends of one long crosshead. In some recent compound engines the large cylinder is horizontal, and the other lies above it in an inclined position, with its connecting-rod working on the same crank- pin. <,p>  In tandem engines, since the pistons move together, there is no need to provide a receiver between the cylinders. It is practicable to follow the “Woolf” plan of allowing the steam to expand directly from the small into the large cylinder ; and in many instances this is done. In point of fact, however, the connecting- pipe and steam-chest form an intermediate receiver of considerable size, which will cause loss by “ drop ” (§ II3) unless steam be cut off in the large cylinder before the end of the stroke. Hence it is more usual to work with a moderately early cut-off in the low- pressure cylinder than to use the “ Woolf ” plan of admitting steam to it throughout the whole stroke. Unless it is desired to make the cut-off occur before half-stroke, a common slide-valve will serve to distribute steam to the large cylinder. For an earlier cut-off than this a separate expansion-valve is required on the low-pressure cylinder, to supplement the slide-valve ; and in any case, by providing a separate expansion-valve, the point of cutoff is made subject to easy control, and may be adjusted so as to avoid drop or to divide the work as may be desired between the two cylinders.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="33"> Οr, alternatively, the adjustment may be made so that the steam undergoes equal changes of temperature in both cylinders. <,note> For this reason it is not unusual to find an expansion-valve, as well as a common slide-valve, on the low-pressure cylinder even of tandem engines. In many cases, however, the common slide-valve only is used. On the high-pressure cylinder <,p>  acting : steam is admitted to the back of the piston only, and the connecting-rod is in compression throughout the whole revolution. Besides simplifying the valves, this has the important advantage that alternation of strain at the joints may be entirely avoided, with the knocking aud wear of the brasses which it is apt to cause. To secure, however, that the connecting-rod shall always push, there must be much cushioning during the back or exhaust stroke. From a point near the middle of the back stroke to the end the piston is being retarded ; and, as this must not be done by the rod (which would thereby be required to pull), cushioning must begin there, and the work spent upon the cushion must at every stage be at least as great as the loss of energy on tho part of the piston and rod. In some single-acting engines this cushioning is done by compressing a portion of the exhaust steam ; in others the rod is kept in compression by help of a supplementary piston, on which steam from the boiler presses ; in Mr Willans’s engine the cushioning is done by compressing air. <,p>  2O3. A very successful example of the multiple-cylinder single- acting high-speed type is the three-cylinder engine introduced by Mr Brotherhood in I873, the most recent form of which is shown in figs. I28 and I29. Fig. I28 is a longitudinal and fig. I29 a transverse section. Three cylinders, set at I2O° apart, project from a closed casing, the central portion of which forms the exhaust. The pistons are of the trunk type—that is to say, there is a joint in the piston itself which allows the piston-rod to oscillate, and so makes a separate connecting-rod unnecessary. The three rods work on a single crank-pin, which is counterbalanced by masses <,p</label>>

I28, in which the twisting moment of the shaft is transmitted through disks of leather, prevents straining of the shaft and bearings through any want of alignment between the shaft of the engine and that of the mechanism it drives. Besides its use as a steam-engine, Mr Brotherhood’s pattern has been extensively applied in driving torpedoes by means of compressed air. As a steam-engine it is compounded by placing a high-pressure cylinder outside of and tandem with each low-pressure cylinder. <,p>  2O4. In other engines of this type a pair of cylinders, or a high and a low pressure cylinder, are set vertically side by side, to work on cranks opposite each other. The cranks aud connecting-rods are completely enclosed, and are lubricated by dipping into a mixture of oil and water with which the lower part of the casing is filled. In the Westinghouse engine, where there are two vertical cylinders to which steam is admitted by a piston-valve, the crank-shaft is situated half a crank’s length out of the line of stroke, to reduce the effects of the connecting-rod’s obliquity during the working stroke.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="34"> See <hi rend="italic">Engineering, <,hi> August I3, I886. <,note> In Mr Willans’s latest form of engine the high and low pressure cylinders are tandem, and the space between the piston forms an intermediate receiver. The piston-rod is hollow, and has a piston-valve in it which controls the admission of steam to the high-pressure cylinder and its transfer to the low-pressure cylinder. The piston-valve within the rod takes its differential motion from an eccentric on the crank-pin. The crosshead is itself a piston working in a cylindrical guide, in which it compresses air as it rises during the back stroke in order to cushion the reciprocating parts.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="34"> See “Discussion on High Speed Motors,” <hi rend="italic">Min. Proc. Inst. <,hi> C.E., Nov. I885. <,note> <,p>  2O5. In engines for pumping or for blowing air it is not essential to drive a revolving shaft, and in many forms the reciprocating motion of the steam-piston is applied directly or through a beam to produce the reciprocating motion of the pump-piston or plunger. On the other hand, pumping engines are frequently made rotative for the sake of adding a fly-wheel. When the level of the suction water is sufficiently high, horizontal engines, with the pump behind the cylinder and in line with it, are generally preferred ; in other cases a beam-engine or vertical direct-acting engine is more common. Horizontal engines are, however, employed to pump water from any depth by using triangular rocking frames, which serve as bell- crank levers between the horizontal piston and vertical pump-rods.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="34"> For an account of beam and other forms of rotative pumping engines, see a <,note> <,p>  Fig. I3O shows a compound inverted vertical pumping engine of the non-rotative class, by Messrs Hathorn, Davey, &amp;amp; Co. Steam is distributed through lift valves, and the engine is governed by the differential gear illustrated in fig. IO7, in conjunction with a cataract, which makes the pistons pause at the end of each stroke. The pistons are in line with two pump-rods, and are coupled by an inverted beam which gives guidance to the crossheads by means of an approximate straight-line motion, which is a modification of that of fig. I2O. Surface condensers are frequently used with pumping engines, the water w’hich the engine pumps serving as circulating water. <,p>  2O6. In a very numerous class of direct-acting steam-pumps, the steam-piston and the pump-piston or plunger are on the same piston-rod. In some of these a rotative element is introduced, partly to secure uniformity of motion, and partly for convenience of working the valves ; a connecting-rod is taken from some point in the piston-rod to a crank-shaft which carries a fly-wheel ; or a <,p>  valves A, worked by an eccentric, the sheave of which is made hollow so as to overhang one of the main bearings (fig. I28). Release takes place by the piston itself uncovering exhaust ports in the circumference of the cylinder, and the rocking motion of the <,p>  slotted crosshead fixed to the rod gives rotary motion to a crank- pin gearing into the slot, the line of the slot being perpendicular to that of the stroke. Many other steam-pumps are strictly non-rotative. In some the valve is worked by tappets from the piston-rod. In the Blake steam-pump a tappet worked by the piston as it reaches each end of its stroke throw’s over an auxiliary steam-valve, which <,p>  admits steam to one or other side of an auxiliary piston carrying the main slide-valve. In Cameron &amp;amp; Floyd’s form one of a pair of tappet-valves at the ends of the cylinder is opened by the piston as it reaches the end of the stroke, and puts one or other side of an auxiliary piston, which carries the slide-valve, into communication with the exhaust, so that it is thrown over. In the Worthington engine—a design which has had much success in America, and is now being introduced in England by Messrs Simpson—two steam cylinders are placed side by side, each working its own pump-piston. The piston-rod of each is connected by a short link to a swinging bar, which actuates the slide-valve of the other steam-cylinder. In this way one piston begins its stroke when the motion of the other is about to cease, and a smooth and continuous action is secured. <,p>  2O7. The Worthington engine has been extensively applied, on a large scale, to raise water for the supply of towns and to force oil through “ pipe-lines ” in the United States. In the larger sizes it is made compound, each high-pressure cylinder having a low-pressure cylinder tandem with it on the same rod. Owing to the lightness of the reciprocating masses, and their comparatively slow acceleration, their inertia does not compensate, to any great extent, for tho inequality of pressure on the pump-piston that would be caused by an early cut-off in the steam cylinder (see § I86). To meet this difficulty, and make high expansion practicable, an ingenious addition has recently been made to the engine.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="34"> <hi rend="italic">Min.

This continues until the <,p>  crosshead has advanced so that the <,p>  cylinders stand at right angles to <,p>  the line of stroke. Then for the re <,p>  mainder of the stroke the compen <,p>  sating cylinders assist in driving <,p>  the main piston, and the compressed <,p>  air gives out the energy which it <,p>  stored in the earlier portion. The <,p>  volume of the air reservoir is so <,p>  much greater than the volume of <,p>  the cylinders B, B that the air <,p>  pressure remains nearly constant throughout the stroke. Any leakage from the cylinder or reservoir is made good by a small pump which the engine drives. One advantage which this method of equalizing the effort of a steam-engine piston has (as compared with making use of the inertia of the reciprocating masses) is that the effort, when adjusted to be uniform at one speed, remains uniform although the speed be changed, provided the inertia of the reciprocating parts be small. In the Worthington “high-duty” engine, where this plan is in use, the high and low pressure cylinders are each provided with a separate expansion-valve of the rocking- cylinder type, as well as a slide-valve ; the cut-off is early, and the efficiency is as high as in other pumping engines of the best class. <,p>  2O8. Mr Hall’s “pulsometer” is a peculiar pumping engine without cylinder or piston, which may be regarded as the modern representative of tho engine of Savery (§ 6). The sectional view, fig. I32, shows its principal parts. There are two chambers A, A', narrowing towards the top, where the <,p>  steam-pipe B enters. A ball-valve C allows <,p>  steam to pass into one of the chambers and <,p>  closes the other. Steam entering (say) the <,p>  right-hand chamber forces water out of it <,p>  past the clack-valve V into a delivery pas <,p>  sage D, which is connected with an air- <,p>  vessel. When the water-level in A sinks <,p>  so far that steam begins to blow through <,p>  the delivery-passage, the water and steam <,p>  are disturbed and so brought into intimate <,p>  contact, the steam in A is condensed, and <,p>  a partial vacuum is formed. This causes <,p>  the ball-valve C to rock over and close the <,p>  top of A, while water rises from the suc <,p>  tion-pipe E to fill that chamber. At the <,p>  same time steam begins to enter the other <,p>  chamber A', discharging water from it, and <,p>  the same series of actions is repeated in <,p>  either chamber alternately. While the water <,p>  is being driven out there is comparatively <,p>  little condensation of steam, partly because the shape of the vessel does not promote the formation of eddies, and partly because there is a cushion of air between the <,p>  steam and the water. Near the <,p>  top of each chamber is a small <,p>  air-valve opening inwards, which <,p>  allows a little air to enter each <,p>  time a vacuum is formed. When <,p>  any steam is condensed, the air <,p>  mixed with it remains on the <,p>  cold surface and forms a non-con <,p>  ducting layer. The pulsometer <,p>  is, of course, far from efficient as <,p>  a thermodynamic engine, but its <,p>  suitability for situations where <,p>  other steam-pumps cannot be <,p>  used, and the extreme simplicity <,p>  of its working parts, make it <,p>  valuable in certain cases. <,p>  2O9. We have seen that the tendency of modern steam practice is towards higher pressures, and that this means a gain both in efficiency and in power for a given weight of engine. High pressure, or indeed any pressure materially above that of the atmosphere, is out of the question when engine and boiler are to work without the regular presence of an attendant. Mr Davey has recently introduced a domestic motor which deserves notice from the fact that it employs steam at atmospheric pressure. One form of this successful little engine is shown in fig. I33. The boiler—which serves as the frame of the engine —is of cast-iron, and is fitted with a cast-iron internal fire-box, with a vertical flue which is traversed by a water-bridge. The <,p>  cylinder, which is enclosed within the upper part of the boiler, and the piston are of gun-metal, and work without lubrication. Steam is admitted by an ordinary slide-valve, also of gun-metal, worked by an eccentric in the usual way. The condenser stands behind the boiler ; it consists of a number of upright tubes in a box, through which a current of cold water circulates from a supply-pipe at the bottom to an overflow-pipe at the top. In larger sizes of the motor the cylinder stands on a distinct frame, and the boiler has a hopper fire-box, which will take a charge of coke sufficient to drive the engine for several hours without attention. About 6 or 7 lb of coke are burned per horse-power per hour. <,p>  2IO. From the earliest days of the rotative engine attempts have been made to avoid the intermittent reciprocating motion which an ordinary piston-engine first produces and then converts into motion of rotation. Murdoch, the contemporary of Watt, proposed an engine consisting of a pair of spur-wheels gearing with one another in a chamber through which steam passed by being carried round the outer sides of the wheels in the spaces between successive teeth.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="35"> See Farey's <hi rend="italic">Treatise on the Steam Engine, <,hi> p. 676. <,note> <,p>  In a more modern wheel-engine (Dudgeon’s) the steam was admitted by ports in side-plates into the clearance space behind teeth in gear with one another, just after they had passed the line of centres. From that point to the end of the arc of contact the clearance space increased in volume ; and it was therefore possible, by stopping the admission of steam at an intermediate point, to work expansively. The difficulty of maintaining steam- tight connexion between the teeth and the side-plates on which the faces of the wheels slide is obvious ; and the same difficulty has prevented the success of many other forms of rotary engine. These have been devised in immense variety, in many cases, it would seem, with the idea that a distinct mechanical advantage was to be secured by avoiding the reciprocating motion of a piston.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="35"> A large number of proposed rotary engines are described, and their kinematic relations to one another are discussed, in Reuleaux’s <hi rend="italic">Kinematics of Machinery, <,hi> translated by Prof. Kennedy. <,note> In point of fact, however, very few forms entirely escape having pieces with reciprocating motion. In all rotary engines, with the exception of steam turbines,—where work is done by the kinetic impulse of steam,—there are steam chambers which alternately expand and contract in volume, and this action usually takes place through a more or less veiled reciprocation of working parts. So long as engines work at a moderate speed there is little advantage in avoiding reciprocation ; the alternate starting and stopping of piston and piston-rod does not affect materially the frictional efficiency, throws no deleterious strain on the joints, and need not disturb the equilibrium of the machine as a whole. The case is different when very high speeds are concerned ; it is then desirable as far as possible to limit the amount of reciprocating motion and to reduce the masses that partake in it. <,p>  2II. A recent interesting and successful example of the rotary type is the spherical engine of Mr Beauchamp Tower,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="35"> <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> March I885. <,note> which, like several of its predecessors,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="35"> One of these, the disk-engine of Bishop, was used for a time in the printing office of <hi rend="italic">The Times, <,hi> but was discarded in I857. <,note> is based on the kinematic relations of the moving pieces in a Hooke’s joint. Imagine a Hooke’s joint, uniting two shafts set obliquely to one another, to be made up of a central disk to which the two shafts are hinged by semicircular plates, each plate working in a hinge which forms a diameter of the central disk, the two hinges being on opposite sides of the disk and at right angles to one another. Further, let the disk and the hinged pieces be enclosed in a spherical chamber through whose walls the shafts project. As the shafts revolve each of the four spaces bounded by the disk, a hinged piece, and the chamber wall will suffer a periodic increase and diminution of volume, between limits which depend on the angle at which the shafts are set. In Mr Tower’s engine this arrangement is modified by using spherical sectors, each a quarter sphere, in place of semicircular plates, for the pieces in which the shafts terminate. The shafts are set at I35°. Each of the four enclosed cavities then alters in volume from zero to a quarter sphere, back to zero, again to a quarter sphere, and again back to zero, in a complete revolution of the shafts. In practice the central disk is a plate of finite thickness, whose edge is kept steam-tight in the enclosing chamber by spring-packing, and the sectors are reduced to an extent corresponding to the thickness of the central disk. One shaft is a dummy and runs free, the other is the driving-shaft. Steam is admitted and exhausted by ports in the spherical sectors, whose backs serve as revolving slide-valves. It is admitted to each cavity during the first part of each periodical increase of the cavity’s volume. It is then cut off and allowed to expand as the cavity further enlarges, and is exhausted as the cavity contracts. If the working shaft, to which the driven mechanism serves as a fly-wheel, revolves uniformly, the dummy shaft is alternately accelerated and retarded. Apart from this, the only reciprocating motion is the small amount of oscillation which the comparatively light central disk undergoes. <,p>  Another rotary engine of the Hooke’s-joint family is Mr Field- <,p</label>>

Attempts have been made from time to time to devise steam-engines of the turbine class, where rotation of a wheel is produced either by reaction from a jet of escaping steam or by impact of a jet upon revolving blades. A revolving piece which is to extract even a respectable fraction of the kinetic energy of a steam jet must move with excessive velocity. In Mr C. A. Parsons’s steam-turbine this difficulty is overcome and a moderate degree of efficiency is secured by using a series of central-flow turbine wheels, in the form of perforated disks, all on one shaft, with fixed disks between which are perforated to serve as guide-blades. Steam passes from end to end of the series, giving up a small portion of its energy to each, but retaining little at the end. <,p>  XII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Marine Engines. <,hi> <,p>  2I3. The early steamers were fitted with paddle-wheels, and the engines used to drive them were for the most part modified beam-engines. Bell’s “ Comet ” (§ 2I) was driven by a species of inverted beam-engine, and another form of inverted beam, known as the side-lever engine, was for long a favourite with marine engineers. In the side-lever engine the cylinder was vertical, and the piston-rod projected through the top. From a crosshead on the rod a pair of links, one on each side of the cylinder, led down to the ends of a pair of horizontal beams or levers below, which oscillated about a fixed gudgeon at or near the middle of their length. The two levers were joined at their other ends by a crosstail, from which a connecting- rod was taken to the crank above. The side-lever engine is now obsolete. <,p>  In American practice, engines of the beam type, with a braced-beam supported on A frames above the deck, are still common in river-steamers and coasters. <,p>  2I4. An old form of direct-acting paddle-engine was the steeple-engine, in which the cylinder was set vertically below the crank. Two piston-rods projected through the top of the cylinder, one on each side of the shaft and of the crank. They were united by a crosshead sliding in vertical guides, and from this a return-connecting-rod led to the crank. <,p>  2I5. Modern paddle-wheel engines are usually of one of the following types. (I) In <hi rend="italic">oscillating cylinder engines <,hi> the cylinders are set under the crank-shaft, and the piston- rods are directly connected to the cranks. The cylinders are supported on trunnions which give them the necessary freedom of oscillation to follow the movement of the crank. Steam is admitted through the trunnions to slide-valves on the sides of the cylinders. In some instances the mean position of the cylinders is inclined instead of vertical; and oscillating engines have been arranged with one cylinder before and another behind the shaft, both pistons working on one crank. The oscillating cylinder type is best adapted for what would now be considered comparatively low pressures of steam. (2) <hi rend="italic">Diagonal engines <,hi> are direct-acting engines of the ordinary connecting-rod type, with the cylinders fixed on an inclined bed and the guides sloping up towards the shaft. <,p>  2I6. When the screw-propeller began to take the place of paddle-wheels in ocean-steamers, the increased speed which it required was at first supplied by using spur-wheel gearing in conjunction with one of the forms of engines then usual in paddle steamers. After a time types of engine better suited to the screw were introduced, and were driven fast enough to be connected directly to the screw-shaft. The smallness of the horizontal space on either side of the shaft formed an obstacle to the use of horizontal engines, but this difficulty was overcome in several ways. In Penn’s trunk-engine, still used in the <,p>  navy, the engine is shortened by attaching the connecting- rod directly to the piston, and using a hollow piston-rod, called a trunk, large enough to allow the connecting-rod to oscillate inside it. The trunk extends through both ends of the cylinder and forms a guide for the piston. It has the drawback of requiring very large stuffing-boxes, of wasting cylinder space, and of presenting a large surface of metal to alternate heating by steam and cooling by contact with the atmosphere. The use of high-pressure steam is likely to make the trunk-engine obsolete. <,p>  2I7. The return-connecting-rod engine is another horizontal form much used in the navy. It is a steeple-engine placed horizontally, with two, and in some cases four, piston-rods in each cylinder. The piston-rods pass clear of the shaft and the crank, and are joined beyond it in a guided crosshead, from which a connecting-rod returns. <,p>  Ordinary horizontal direct-acting engines with a short stroke and a short connecting-rod are also common in warships, where the horizontal is frequently preferred to the vertical type of engine for the sake of keeping the machinery below the water-line. In horizontal marine engines the air-pump and condenser are generally placed on the opposite side of the shaft from the cylinder, which balances the weight and allows the air-pump to be driven direct. <,p>  2I8. In merchant ocean-steamers one general type of engine is universal, and the same type is now to an increasing extent adopted in naval practice. This is the inverted vertical direct-acting engine, generally with two or more cylinders placed side by side directly over the shaft. In exceptional cases a single cylinder has been used, with a fly-wheel on the shaft. Two, three, and four cylinders are common. <,p>  The most usual form of existing marine engine is the two- cylinder compound arrangement, with cranks at right angles or nearly at right angles, of which figs. I35, I36, I37 (pp. 5I8-2O) show a characteristic example (the engines of the s.s. “Tartar,” by Messrs John &amp;amp; James Thomson, Glasgow). <,p>  Fig. I35 is an end elevation, fig. I36 a longitudinal section through the centre of the engines, and fig. I37 a thwart-ship section through the condenser and air-pump. The cylinders are 5O and 9I inches in diameter, and the stroke is 5 feet. Both cylinders are fitted with liners, and are steam-jacketed. Double-ported slide- valves are used on both, and the high-pressure valve has a reliefring. The crosshead guides are fitted on the side on which the crosshead bears when the engines are going ahead, with a hollow box behind the guiding surface, and cold water is kept circulating in this to prevent the guides from heating. <,p>  The crank-shaft is of Vicker’s steel, I7,inches in diameter. The condenser is in the place it usually has in engines of this type,— in the lower part of the backframe, with its tubes running horizontally from end to end of the engine. There are I4OO tubes, of I inch diameter and I,inch pitch. The air-pumps are of the single- acting bucket kind, and are driven by a lever from the crosshead. <,p>  Centrifugal circulating pumps are used, driven by a pair of independent small vertical engines. The link-motion is worked by steam starting and reversing gear, which appears on the left side of the engine in fig. I35. These engines work with a boiler pressure of 9O lb, and indicate 356O horse-power. Fig. I34 shows, on a larger scale, the piston packing, which consists of a pair of floating rings, pressed out by a spiral spring behind them. <,p>  2I9. Two other arrangements of double compound (as distinguished from triple-expansion) marine engines of the inverted vertical type require notice. One is the tandem arrangement, largely adopted in the steamers of the “White Star” line. In these each crank is operated by an independent pair of compound cylinders, the high-pressure cylinder being on top of the low- pressure cylinder, with one piston-rod common to both, The valves of both are worked by a single pair of eccentrics with a link-motion ; the valve-rod of the low-pressure cylinder extends through the top of its valve-chest, and is joined either directly or by a short lever with the valve-rod of the high-pressure cylinder. Generally two pairs of tandem cylinders are placed side by side, one pair abaft the other, to work on cranks at right angles. In exceptionally large engines three pairs have been used, working on <,p</label>>

The other arrangement of double compound marine engine has three cylinders set in line fore and aft. The middle one is the high-pressure cylinder ; the other two receive steam from it, and form together the equivalent of one large low-pressure cylinder. The three work on cranks at I2O° apart. Besides securing the advantage in uniformity of effort which three cranks have over two, this form avoids the use, in very powerful engines, of a low- pressure cylinder of excessive size. On the other hand, the three- cylinder form takes up more space, and has a larger number of working parts. In the most powerful engines that have yet been constructed this three-cylinder arrangement is followed.

During the last two or three years a great advance has taken place in marine engineering by the general introduction of triple-expansion engines, and by an increase in steam pressure which the system of triple expansion makes practicable. In I874 the steamer “Propontis” was fitted with a set of three-crank triple-expansion engines, designed by Mr A. C. Kirk. The experiment was prevented from being fully successful by the failure of the boilers, which were of a special type. Another experiment with triple engines in the yacht “Isa” in I877 prepared the way for their application to regular ocean service. In I882 the steamship “Aberdeen,” with triple engines, designed by Mr Kirk, to work with steam of I25 lb pressure, supplied from <,p>  double-ended steel boilers of the <,p>  ordinary marine type, demon <,p>  strated the advantage and safety <,p>  of the system. Since then its <,p>  use has become general in new <,p>  steamers, and in many cases the <,p>  older double engines are being <,p>  removed to give place to engines <,p>  of the triple-expansion type, <,p>  with the effect of reducing the <,p>  consumption of coal by about <,p>  25 per cent.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="37"> The rapid progress of the system of triple expansion may be judged from the fact mentioned by Mr W. Parker of Lloyds in a recent paper (<hi rend="italic">Engineering, <,hi> July 3O, I886), that, out of I99 engines then being built for merchant steamers, I28 sets were of the triple-expansion type. For war-ships also triple engines are being built of sizes up to I3,OOO horse-power. For a discussion of several important points in the design of triple-expansion engines, see a paper by R. Wyllie, <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng., <,hi> Oct. I886. <,note> <,p>  222. In the most common arrangement of triple-expansion engines three cylinders are ranged in line, fore and aft, working on cranks at I2O° apart. <,p>  Piston-valves are generally preferred, and these are not uncommonly worked by some form of radial valve-gear instead of the ordinary link-motion. An advantage of this is that the space which would be taken up by eccentrics upon the shaft is saved, and longer main bearings are in consequence possible, without spreading the engines in the fore-and-aft direction. An objectionable feature of the three-cylinder triple engine is its length; on the other hand, the high speed and high pressure which are features of modern practice make long bearings indispensable. <,p>  223. To avoid the length of the three-crank engine, Mr Brock and others have made engines of the triple-expansion type with two cranks, by putting the high and the intermediate pressure cylinders above and tandem with two low-pressure cylinders. Mi-Brock has also built four-cylinder <hi rend="italic">quadruple <,hi> -expansion engines of a similar form (with two cranks), and estimates that they show an economy in coal consumption of 5 per cent. as compared with triple-expansion engines <,p>  working with the same pressure of steam. <,p>  224. Steam-jackets are retained by some but not by <,p>  all builders ; where they are employed the boiler steam is usually reduced in pressure before admission to the intermediate and low-pressure cylinder jackets and to the receiver-jackets. The feed-water is frequently heated to about 2OO° F. by Weir’s plan of condensing in it, by common injection, a quantity of steam taken from the second receiver ; this has the advantage of freeing it of air, and of preventing local chilling in the boiler. In present-day practice the boiler pressure, for a triple- expansion engine, ranges from I2O to I7O lb per square inch (by gauge), and it does not appear that any material increase of this is possible without a complete departure from the present type of marine boiler. On the other hand, without a material increase of pressure there is little advantage in quadruple <,p>  expansion. <,p>  225. Surface condensation was introduced in marine engines by S. Hall in I83I, but was not brought into general use until much later. Previous to this it had been necessary, in order to avoid the accumulation of too dense brine in the boiler, to blow off a portion of the brine at short intervals and replace it by sea water, a process which of course involved much waste of heat. By the use of surface condensers it became possible to use the same portion of water over and over again. The very freedom of the condensed water from dissolved mineral substances was for a time an obstacle to the adoption of surface condensers, for it was found that the boiler, no longer protected by a deposit of scale, became rapidly corroded through the action of acids formed by the decomposition of the lubricating oil. This objection was overcome by introducing a sufficient amount of salt water to allow some scale to form, and the use of surface condensers soon became universal on steamers plying in sea water. The marine condenser consists of a multitude <,p</label>>

Through these cold sea-water is made to circulate, while the steam is brought into contact with their outside surfaces. In some cases, especially in Admiralty practice, cold water circulates outside the tubes and the steam passes inside. <,p>  226. The ordinary marine engine has four pumps:—the air-pump, which is made large enough to serve in case injection instead of surface-condensation should at any time be resorted to; the feedpump; the circulating-pump, which maintains a current of seawater through the <,p>  tubes of the condenser; <,p>  and the bilge-pump, <,p>  which discharges any <,p>  water accumulated by <,p>  leakage or otherwise <,p>  in the bilge of the <,p>  ship.

In the improvement of the marine engine two points are noteworthy,—reduction in the rate of consumption of coal per horsepower, and reduction in the weight of the machine (comprising the engine proper anti the boilers) per horsepower. The second consideration is in some cases of even more moment than the first, especially in war-ships. <,p>  Progress has been made, in both respects, by increase of steam pressure, and, in the second respect especially, by increase of piston speed. Fifty years ago the boilers of marine engines made steam at a pressure of about 5 lb per square inch above that of the atmosphere. By I86O compound engines were in use with pressures ranging from 25 to 4O lb. In I872 statistics collected for nineteen ocean steamers showed that the average consumption of coal was then 2·II lb per H.P. per hour, the boiler- pressure 45 to 6O lb, and the mean piston speed about 375 feet per minute.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="38"> Sir F. J. Bramwell, <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng. <,hi> ,I872. <,note> These were for the most part two-cylinder compound engines of the vertical inverted type.

North-East Coast Inst. Engineers and Shipbuilders, <,hi> I886. <,note> The economy in coal consumption brought about by the change from double-expansion engines working at (say) 8O lb to triple engines at I6O lb or more is variously estimated at from I8 to 25 per cent. Much of this is due simply to the increased range of temperature through which the working substance is carried ; but it appears that the actual performance of the triple engine is better than that of the double compound in a ratio greater than that by which its ideal efficiency—as an engine using a wider range of temperature—exceeds that of the other; and this is to be ascribed to the same causes as have been already discussed in speaking of the advantage of the compound over the simple engine. Apart from its greater economy of coal, the triple engine owes some of its practical success to the mechanical superiority of three driving cranks <,p>  over two. <,p>  228. The relation of weight of machinery to power developed, and the causes which affect this ratio, have recently been discussed by Messrs Marshall and Weighton,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="38"> <hi rend="italic">Loc. cit. <,hi> <,note> from whose paper the following figures are taken. Before the introduction of triple expansion and forced draught the weight of engines in the mercantile marine, including the boilers and the water in them, was 48O lb per I.H. P. In the navy this was reduced, chiefly by the use of lighter framing, with the object of minimizing weight, to 36O lb. Triple-engines of the merchant type, without forced draught, are only slightly lighter than double engines ; but in naval practice, where forced draught, greatly increased speed, and the use of steel for frames and working parts have combined to reduce the ratio of weight to power, a marked reduction in weight is apparent. A recent set of vertical triple engines, which with natural draught indicate 22OO H.P., and with a draught forced by pressure in the stokehole equal to 2 inches of water indicate 4OOO H. P., weigh under the latter condition (along with the boilers) only I55 lb per <,p>  I.H.P. In another set, in which the draught is forced by a pressure of 3 inches, and the cylinders are only I5½, 24, and 37 inches in diameter, with a stroke of I6 inches, the indicated horse-power is 42OO, and the weight of engines and boilers is I36 lb per I.H.P. In these the boilers are of the locomotive type, and the mean piston speed is IO66 feet per minute. Even these light weights are surpassed in smaller engines, such as those of torpedo boats. In so far as this immense development of power from a small weight o machinery is due to high piston speed it is secured without loss —indeed with some gain—of thermodynamic efficiency , forced draught, however, without a corresponding extension of the heating <,p</label>>

The ordinary locomotive consists of a pair of direct acting horizontal or nearly horizontal engines, fixed in a rigid frame under the front end of a boiler of the type described in § I33, and coupled to the same shaft by cranks at right angles, each with a single slide-valve worked by a link-motion, or by a form of radial gear. The engine is non-condensing, except in special cases, and the exhaust steam, delivered at the base of the funnel through a blast-pipe, serves to produce a draught of air through the furnace. In some instances a portion of the exhaust steam, amounting to about one-fifth of the whole, is diverted to heat the feed-water. In tank engines the feed-water is carried in tanks on the engine itself; in other engines it is carried behind in a tender. <,p>  23O. On the shaft are a pair of driving-wheels, whose frictional adhesion to the rails furnishes the necessary tractive force. In some engines a single pair of driving- wheels are used ; in many more a greater tractive force is secured by having two equal driving-wheels on each side, connected by a coupling-rod between pins on the outside of the wheels. In goods engines a still greater proportion of the whole weight is utilized to give tractive force by coupling three and even four wheels on each side. These arrangements are distinguished by the terms “ four- coupled,” “six-coupled,” and “ eight-coupled ” applied to the engines. In <hi rend="italic">inside-cylinder <,hi> engines the cylinders are placed side by side within the frame of the engine, and their connecting-rods work on cranks in the driving shaft. In <hi rend="italic">outside-cylinder <,hi> engines the cylinders are spread apart far enough to lie outside the frame of the engine, and to work on crank-pins on the outsides of the driving wheels. This dispenses with the cranked axle, which is the weakest part of a locomotive engine. Owing to the frequent <,p>  alternation of strain to which it is subject, a locomotive crank axle is peculiarly liable to rupture, and has to be removed after a certain amount of use. <,p>  In some locomotives the leading wheels are coupled to driving wheels behind them, but it is now generally preferred to have under the front of the engine two or four smaller wheels which do not form part of the driving system. These are carried in a <hi rend="italic">bogie, <,hi> that is, a small truck upon which the front end of the boiler rests by a swivel- pin or plate which allows the bogie to turn, so as to adapt itself to curves in the line, and thus obviate the grinding of tyres and danger of derailment which would be caused by using a long rigid wheel-base. The bogie appears to have been of English origin ;<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="39"> <hi rend="italic superscript"> @@@ <,hi> <hi rend="italic">Min. Proc. Inst.

Instead of a four-wheeled bogie, a single pair of leading wheels are also used, carried by a Bissel <hi rend="italic">pony <,hi> truck, which has a swing-bolster pivoted by a radius bar about a point some distance behind the axis of the wheels. This has the advantage of combining lateral with radial movement of the wheels, both being required if the wheel base is to be properly accommodated to the curve. Another method of getting lateral and radial freedom is the plan used by Mr Webb of carrying the leading axle in a box curved to the arc of a circle, and free to slide laterally for a short distance, under the control of springs, in curved guides.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="39"> <hi rend="italic">Proc.

The width of the engine within the frame leaves little room for them there, and they are reduced to the flattest possible form, in some cases with split ports, half above and half below a partition in a central horizontal plane. In some of Mr Stroudley’s engines the valves are below the cylinders, with faces sloping down towards the front, while the cylinders themselves slope slightly up. In many engines the valves work on horizontal planes above the cylinders ; this position is specially suitable when Joy’s or some other form of radial gear is used instead of the link-motion. Radial valve-gears have the advantage, which is of considerable moment in inside-cylinder engines, that the <,p>  part of the shafts’ length which would <,p>  otherwise be needed for eccentrics is <,p>  available to increase the width of <,p>  main bearings and crank-pins, and to <,p>  strengthen the crank-cheeks.

In a powerful locomotive of the ordinary type the cylinders are I7 to I9 inches in diameter, with a stroke of about 26 inches. The steam pressure is I3O to I75 lb. <,p>  The horse-power ranges up to about 7OO.

Another form of frame is built up of two longitudinal plates on each side. In the engine illustrated the valves are above the cylinders, and are worked by Joy’s gear. A bogie truck appears in section below the engine. S is the steam-pipe, and B the blast-pipe, which is tapered in the fore-and-aft plane. <,p>  233. The outside-cylinder type is adopted by several British makers ; in America it is universal. There the cylinders are in castings which are <,p>  bolted together to form a saddle on <,p>  which the bottom of the smoke-box <,p>  sits. The slide-valves are on the <,p>  tops of the cylinders, and are worked <,p>  through rocking levers from an ordi <,p>  nary link-motion. Other features <,p>  by which American practice is dis <,p>  tinguished are the use of bars in <,p>  stead of plates for the frames, of <,p>  cast-iron wheels with chilled rims <,p>  instead of wrought-iron wheels with <,p>  steel rims shrunk or forced on, and <,p>  steel fire-boxes and wrought-iron <,p>  tubes instead of copper fire-boxes <,p>  and brass tubes. Fig. I39, which <,p>  is a half section through one cyl <,p>  inder of an American locomotive, <,p>  by the Balwin Company of Phila <,p>  delphia, shows the position of the cylinders and valves. <,p>  234. Locomotive engines have been compounded in <,p>  cylinders are fixed outside the frames, and drive the rear driving axle by crank-pins at right angles to one another. A single low-pressure cylinder of very large size is set beneath the smoke-box, and drives a crank in the middle of the forward driving axle. The driving axles are not coupled, and the phase relation of the low-pressure to the high-pressure stroke is liable to alter through unequal slip on the part of the wheels. This, however, is of no material consequence, on account of the large size of the intermediate receiver and the uniformity with which the two high-pressure cylinders deliver steam to it. The receiver is formed, as in M. Mallet’s arrangement, by leading long connecting pipes through the smoke-box. All three slide-valves are worked by Joy’s gear. Those of the low-pressure cylinders are placed below the cylinders (an arrangement which has the advantage of letting the valve fall away from the port-face when the engine is running down hill with the steam-valve closed); the valve of the large cylinder is above it. The arrangement is completely symmetrical ; it has the important mechanical advantage of dispensing with coupling rods, while retaining the <,p>  several ways. In I876 M. A. Mallet@@ <hi rend="superscript"> I <,hi> introduced, on tho Bayonne and Biarritz Railway, a type of compound locomotive in which one small high-pressure cylinder and one large low-pressure cylinder were used in place of the two equal cylinders of a common locomotive. Outside cylinders were used in the first instance, but Mallet’s system is also applied to inside-cylinder engines. The pipe from the high to the low-pressure cylinder takes a winding course through the smoke-box ; this gives a sufficient volume of intermediate receiver, and also dries the steam before it enters the large cylinder. A reducing valve is provided through which steam of a pressure lower than that of the boiler can be admitted direct to the low-pressure cylinder to facilitate starting. The reversing gear is arranged to act on both cylinders by one movement, and also to permit a separate adjustment of the cut-off in each. Engines on Mallet’s system have been successfully used on other Continental railways and in India, in some instances by conversion from the non-compound form.@@ <hi rend="superscript"> 2 <,hi> His plan has the advantage of permitting this (in certain cases), and of requiring scarcely any more working parts than are needed in a common locomotive ; but it gives an unsymmetrical engine. He has also proposed an engine with four cylinders,—one high-pressure cylinder tandem with one low-pressure cylinder on each side. Another symmetrical form has been used, in which a pair of outside high- pressure cylinders are compounded with a pair of inside low-pressure cylinders. <,p>  235. The most important experiment yet made in the compounding of locomotives is that which Mr F. W. Webb, of the London and North-Western Railway, has been conducting on a large scale since I88I.@@ <hi rend="superscript"> 3 <,hi> In Mr Webb’s system three cylinders are used. Two equal high-pressure <,p>  greater tractive power of four drivers ; only one axle is cranked, and that with a single crank in the centre, which leaves ample room for long bearings. A plan of Mr Webb’s engine, half in section, is given in fig. I4O. The results of Mr Webb’s experiments have been, in his judgment, so satisfactory that for express passenger service he is now building engines only of the compound type. In some recent examples the small cylinders are I4 inches, and the large cylinder 3O inches in diameter, with a stroke of 24 inches, and the boiler pressure is I75 lb. Engines of the same type are also being introduced in India, South America, aud the continent of Europe. <,p>  236. Experiments on the saving of fuel by compounding locomotives point to an economy of from IO to 2O per cent. It may be expected, for reasons which have been discussed above, that a compound engine, even when working at the high speed of a locomotive, will have a somewhat higher efficiency than a non-compound engine. <,p>  <hi rend="superscript"> I <,hi> <hi rend="italic">Proc.

Experiments on the steam-jacketing of locomotive cylinders have not hitherto been attended by success. <,p>  237. <hi rend="italic">Tramway locomotives <,hi> for the most part resemble railway locomotives in the general features of their design. The boiler is of the usual locomotive type. A pair of cylinders in front, either inside or outside the frames, are connected directly to the hindmost of two coupled driving axles. Owing to the smallness of the driving-wheels, the axles lie near the road, and the cylinders are set sloping at a considerable angle upwards to keep them clear of dirt. To prevent the discharge of steam into the atmosphere, the exhaust steam is often led into an atmospheric condenser, consisting of a large number of pipes set on the top of the engine, and exposed to free contact with the air. In some instances the common locomotive type is widely departed from : a mixed vertical and horizontal boiler is used, and the engine is connected to the driving axle by worm-wheel or other gear, or by a rocking lever between the connecting-rod and the crank.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="40"> See <hi rend="italic">Min.

Léon Francq, a reservoir which takes the place of an ordinary boiler is charged at the beginning of the journey with water heated under pressure by injecting steam from stationary boilers at a pressure of I5 atmospheres. The thermal capacity of the water is sufficient—without further addition of heat—to supply steam to the engine during the journey, at a pressure which gradually falls off.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="40"> <hi rend="italic">Proc.

In this way the air is heated, and may then expand in the cylinder without having its temperature lowered to an objectionable degree. <,p>  24O. Steam <hi rend="italic">road-locomotives <,hi> or traction-engines have usually a boiler of the locomotive type, with a cylinder or compound pair of cylinders, generally on the top, driving a shaft from which motion is taken by a gearing chain or spur-wheels to a single driving axle at the fire-box end. The engine is steered by means of a leading axle, whose direction is controlled by a hand-wheel and chain-gear. To facilitate rapid turning the driving-wheels are connected to their axle by a differential or compensating gear which allows them to revolve at different speeds. This is a set of four bevel-wheels like White’s dynamometer coupling : the outside bevel-wheels are attached to the driving- wheels ; the intermediate ones, which gear with these, turn in bearings in a revolving wheel driven by the engine. So long as both driving-wheels are equally resisted both are driven at the same speed, but if one is retarded (as the inner wheel is in turning a curve) it acts to some extent as a fulcrum to the bevel gear, and the outer wheel takes a greater share of the motion. An important feature in traction engines is the elasticity of the driving-wheels. Many devices have been employed, partly to give the wheels an extended tread, or arc of contact with the ground, and partly to avoid shocks in passing over rough ground. Both objects are accomplished <,p>  by Mr R. W. Thomson’s plan of surrounding each wheel with a thick tyre of india-rubber, protected on the outside by an armour of small plates. In most modern traction- engines the rim is itself rigid, but is connected to the nave through a system of springs which allow it to take up an eccentric position, and the tyres have skew bars on the surface to increase their adhesion to the road. <,p>  XIV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Air and Gas Engines. <,hi> <,p>  24I. Under this head we may include all heat-engines in which the working substance is air, or the gaseous products of the combustion of fuel and air, whether the fuel be itself solid, liquid, or gaseous. When air alone forms the working substance, it receives heat from an external furnace by conduction through the walls of a containing vessel, as the working substance in the steam-engine takes in heat through the shell of the boiler. An engine supplied with heat in this way may be called an <hi rend="italic">external- combustion <,hi> engine, to distinguish it from a very important class of engines in which the combustion which supplies heat occurs within a closed chamber containing the working substance. The ordinary coal-gas explosive engine is the most common type of <hi rend="italic">internal-combustion <,hi> engine. <,p>  242. Compared with an engine using saturated steam, air and gas engines have the important advantage that the temperature and the pressure of the working substance are independent of one another. Hence it becomes possible to use an upper limit of temperature greatly higher than in the ordinary steam-engine, and if the lower limit is not correspondingly raised an increase of thermodynamic efficiency results. It is true that the same advantage might be obtained in the case of steam, by excessive superheating; but this would mean substantially the conversion of the engine into the type we are now considering, the working substance being then steam gas. <,p>  243. A simple, thermodynamically perfect form of external- combustion air-engine would be one following Carnot’s cycle (§ 4O), in which heat is received while the air is at the highest temperature τ, the air meanwhile expanding isothermally. After this the supply of heat is stopped, and the air is allowed to expand adiabatically until its temperature falls to the lower extreme τ. At this it is compressed isothermally, giving out heat, and finally the cycle is completed by adiabatic compression, which restores the initial high temperature τ. <,p>  244. In place of adiabatic expansion as a means of changing the temperature from τto τwe may follow Stirling’s plan (§ 54) of <,p>  storing the heat in a regenerator, from which it will afterwards be taken up and so produce the elevation of temperature from τto τwhich in the above cycle was performed by adiabatic compression. <,p>  Stirling’s air-engine, in which the action approximated to the perfect cycle described in § 54, is diagramatic- ally shown in fig. I4I. A is a closed vessel containing air, externally heated by a furnace beneath it. A pipe from the top of A leads to the working cylinder B. At the top of A is a refrigerator C, consisting of pipes through which cold water circulates. In A there is a displacer plunger D, which is driven by the engine ; when this is raised the air in A is heated, whereas when D is lowered the air in A is brought into contact with the refrigerator and cooled. On its way from the bottom to the top of A, or <hi rend="italic">viee versa, <,hi> the air must pass through an annular lining of wire-gauze E. This is the regenerator. At the beginning of the cycle D is up. The air is then receiving heat at τ,, and is expanding isothermally ; this is the first stage in § 54. Then the plunger D descends. The air is driven through the regenerator, where it deposits heat, and its temperature on emerging at the top is τ. Next, the working- <,p</label>>

Finally the plunger is raised, and the working air again passes through the regenerator, taking up the heat it left there, and rising to τ. The theoretical indicator diagram has been given in fig. I3. <,p>  245. The actual forms in which Stirling’s engine was used are described in two patents by R. &amp;amp; J. Stirling (I827 and I84O<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="41"> The I827 patent is reproduced in F. Jenkin’» Lecture on Gas and Caloric Engines, <hi rend="italic">Inst. Civ. Eng., <,hi> Heat Lectures, I883-84. See also <hi rend="italic">Min. Proc. Inst. C.E, <,hi> I8I5 and I854. <,note> ). An important feature in them was that the air was compressed (by means of a pump) to a pressure greatly above that of the atmosphere. Stirling’s cycle is theoretically perfect whatever the density of the working air, and compression did not in his case increase what may be called the theoretical thermodynamic efficiency. It did, however, very greatly increase the mechanical efficiency, and also, what is of special importance, it increased the amount of power yielded by an engine of given size. To see this it is sufficient to consider that with compressed air a greater amount of heat was dealt with in each stroke of the engine, and therefore a greater amount of work was produced. Practically it also increased the thermodynamic efficiency by reducing the ratio of the heat wasted by external conduction and radiation to the whole heat. <,p>  A double-acting Stirling engine of 5O I.H.P., used in I843 at the Dundee foundry, appears to have realized an efficiency of O·3, and, notwithstanding very inadequate means of heating the air, consumed only l·7 lb of coal per I.H.P. per hour.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="41"> See Rankine’s <hi rend="italic">Steam, Engine, <,hi> p. 367. The consumption per brake H.P. was much greater. <,note> This engine remained at work for three years, but was finally abandoned on account of the failure of the heating vessels. In some forms of Stirling’s engine the regenerator was a separate vessel ; in others the plunger D was itself constructed to serve as regenerator by filling it with wire-gauze and leaving holes at top and bottom for the passage of the air through it. <,p>  246. Another mode of using the regenerator was introduced in America by Ericsson, in an engine which also failed, partly because the heating surfaces became burnt, and partly because their area was insufficient. In Ericsson’s engine the temperature of the working substance is changed (by passing through the regenerator) while the pressure remains constant. Cold air is compressed by a pump into a receiver, from which it passes through a regenerator into the working cylinder. In so passing it absorbs heat from the regenerator and expands. The air in the cylinder is then further expanded by taking in heat from a furnace under the cylinder. The cycle is completed by the discharge of the air through the regenerator. The indicator diagram approximates to a form bounded by two isothermals and two lines of constant pressure.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="41"> For a diagram of Ericsson’s engine see Rankine’s <hi rend="italic">Steam Engine, <,hi> or <hi rend="italic">Proc.

Powerful engines of this type are impracticable on account of their relatively enormous bulk. Those that are now manufactured resemble the original Stirling engine very closely in the main features of their action, and comprise essentially the same organs.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="41"> For description of Robinson's, Bailey’s, and Rider’s hot-air engines see F.

In these engines coal or coke is burnt under pressure in a closed chamber, to which the fuel is fed through a species of air-lock. Air for combustion is supplied by a compressing pump, and the engine is governed by means of a distributing valve which supplies a greater or less proportion of the air below the fire as the engine runs slow or fast. The products of combustion, whose volume is increased by their rise in temperature, pass into a working cylinder, raising the piston. When a certain fraction of the stroke is over the supply of hot gas is stopped, and the gases in the cylinder expand, doing more work and becoming reduced in temperature. During the return stroke they are discharged into the atmosphere, and the pump takes in a fresh supply of air. Fig. I42 is a diagram section of the Buckett engine. A is the working piston, the form of which is such as to protect the tight sliding surface (at the top) from contact with the hot gases ; B is the compressing pump, C the valve by which the governor regulates the rate at which fuel is consumed, and D the air-lock through w’hich fuel is supplied. <,p>  249. In engines of this class the degree to which the action is thermodynamically efficient depends very largely on the amount of cooling the gases undergo by adiabatic or nearly adiabatic expansion under the working piston. Without a large ratio of expansion the thermodynamic advantage of a high initial tem <,p>  perature is lost ; but, as the gases have to be discharged at atmospheric pressure, a large ratio of expansion is possible only when there is much initial compression. Compression is therefore an <,p>  essential condition, without w’hich a heat-engine of this type cannot be made efficient. It is also, as has already been pointed out, essential in all air-engines to the development of a fair amount of power by an engine of moderate bulk. <,p>  25O. Internal-combustion engines using solid fuel have hitherto been little used, and that only for small powers. Several small engines employ liquid fuel (namely, petroleum) injected in a state of spray, or even vaporized before entering the combustion-chamber. In some forms, of w’hich the Brayton petroleum engine is a type, combustion occurs as the fuel is injected ; in others the action approaches closely that of <hi rend="italic">gas-engines, <,hi> that is to say, of engines in which fuel (generally coal-gas) is supplied in a perfectly gaseous state, and is burnt in a more or less explosive manner. These last are the only heat-engines that have as yet entered into serious competition with steam-engines. <,p>  25I. The earliest gas-engine to be brought iuto practical use was that of Lenoir (I86O). During the first part of the stroke air and gas, in proportions suitable for combustion, were drawn into the cylinder. At about half-stroke the inlet valve closed, and the mixture was immediately exploded by an electric spark. The heated products of combustion then did work on the piston during the remainder of the forward stroke, and were expelled during the back stroke. The engine was double-acting, and the cylinder was prevented from becoming excessively heated by a casing through which water was kept circulating. The water-jacket has been retained in nearly all later gas-engines. <,p>  An indicator diagram from a Lenoir engine is shown in fig. I43.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="41"> Slade, <hi rend="italic">Jour. Franklin Inst., <,hi> I866. <,note> After explosion the line falls, partly from expansion, and partly from the cooling action of the cylinder walls ; <,p>  on the other hand, its level is to some extent <,p>  maintained by the phenomenon of after-burn <,p>  ing, which will be discussed later. In this <,p>  engine, chiefly because there was no compres <,p>  sion, the heat removed by the water-jacket <,p>  bore an exceedingly large proportion to the whole heat, and the efficiency was comparatively low ; about 95 cubic feet of gas were used per horse-power per hour. Hugon’s engine, introduced five years later, was a non-compressive engine very similar to Lenoir’s. A novel feature in it was the injection of a jet of cold water to keep the cylinder from becoming too hot. These engines are now obsolete ; the type they belonged to, in which the mixture is not compressed before explosion, is now represented by one small engine—Bischoffs—the mechanical simplicity of which atones for its comparatively wasteful action in certain cases where but little power is required. <,p>  252.

The explosion occurred early in the stroke, in a vertical cylinder, under a piston which was free to rise without doing work on the engine shaft. The piston rose w’ith great velocity, so that the expansion was much more nearly adiabatic than in earlier engines.

The burnt gases were discharged during the last part of the down-stroke. A friction-coupling allowed the piston to be automatically thrown out of gear when rising, and into gear when descending. This “ atmospheric ” gas engine used about 4O cubic feet of gas per horse-power per hour, and came into somewhat extensive use in spite of its noisy and spasmodic action. After a few years it was displaced by a greatly improved type, in which the direct action of Lenoir’s engine was restored, but the gases were compressed before ignition. <,p>  253. Dr Otto’s “silent” engine, introduced in I876, was the first successful motor of the modern type. It is a single-acting engine, generally horizontal in form, and the explosive mixture is compressed in the working cylinder itself. This is done by making the cycle of the action extend through two revolutions of the engine. During the first forward stroke gas and air are drawn in by the piston. During the first back-stroke the mixture is compressed into a large clearance space at the end of the cylinder. The mixture is then ignited, and the second forward stroke (which is the only working stroke in the cycle) is performed under the pressure of the heated products of combustion. During the second back-stroke the products are discharged, with the exception of so much as remains in the clearance space, which serves to dilute the explosive mixture in the next cycle. The principal parts of Otto’s engine (as made by Messrs Crossley) are shown in the diagram section, fig. I44. The cylinder is kept <,p>  cool by a water-jacket AA. B <,p>  is the clearance space into which <,p>  the mixture is compressed before <,p>  explosion. Its volume is usually about two-thirds of the stroke, or 4O per cent. of the whole volume to which the gases afterwards expand. C is the exhaust-valve, which is opened during the second back-stroke of each cycle. Gas and air are admitted at D, through a slide-valve E, which reciprocates once in each complete cycle of two revolutions. This slide-valve is shown to a larger scale in fig. I45, in the position it occupies while gas is entering from <hi rend="italic">g <,hi> and air from <hi rend="italic">a. <,hi> To ignite the mixture a gas- jet is kept burning at <hi rend="italic">c. <,hi> In the slide-valve there is an igniting port <hi rend="italic">d, <,hi> which is supplied with gas from a groove in the cover. As the slide moves towards the right, the igniting port <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> carries a flame from <hi rend="italic">c <,hi> to D. <,p>  Just before reaching D a little of the compressed mixture from the cylinder enters the igniting port by a small opening which does not appear in the figure, and by the time D is reached the contents of <hi rend="italic">d <,hi> are so much raised in pressure by their own combustion that a tongue of flame shoots into the cylinder, firing the mixture there. The speed is regulated by a centrifugal governor, which cuts off the supply of gas when the speed exceeds a certain limit. In some small Otto engines of recent construction the inertia of a reciprocating piece is used instead of the inertia of revolving pieces to effect the same end. <,p>  254. In Mr Clerk’s engine the cycle of operations is essentially the same as in Otto’s, but a charging cylinder <,p>  is introduced, with the effect of allowing an explosion to take place in the working cylinder once in every revolution. As in Otto’s, there is a large clearance space behind the piston, and the mixture is compressed into this space by the backward movement of the working piston. The peculiarity of the engine lies in the manner in which the charge is introduced. As the piston advances after an explosion it uncovers exhaust ports in the sides of the cylinder, close to the end of its forward stroke. While it is passing the dead-point there the plunger of the charging cylinder (which has meanwhile taken in a mixture of gas and air) delivers this mixture into the cylinder, driving the products of the previous combustion out of the cylinder through the exhaust ports. The charging cylinder is so arranged that the first part of the charge consists almost wholly of air, and this is followed by the explosive mixture of gas and air. The working piston then returns, closing the exhaust ports and compressing the mixture, which is ignited after compression by means of a slide-valve similar to Otto’s. In Otto’s engine the explosive mixture is diluted, and the sharpness of the explosion thereby reduced, by the residue of burnt products which fill the clearance space at the end of the discharge stroke. In Clerk’s engine the mixture is diluted by an excess of air. It does not appear that this difference has any material effect on the action. <,p>  255. Over 2O,OOO Otto engines are now in use, of power ranging up to about 4O H.P. Besides the engines which have been named, others are manufactured in which the <,p>  operations are essentially of the same kind, though in some cases the mechanical details are widely varied. In one of these, Mr Atkinson’s ingenious “ differential ” engine, the working chamber consists of the space between two pistons working in one cylinder. During exhaust the pistons come close together ; they recede from each other to take in a fresh charge ; they approach for compression ; and finally they recede again very rapidly and farther than before, after ignition of the mixture, thus giving a comparatively large ratio of expansion. At the same time, by moving bodily along through the cylinder, the pistons uncover admission and exhaust ports and an ignition- <,p>  tube, which is kept permanently incandescent. <,p>  256. If the explosion of a gaseous mixture were practically instantaneous, producing at once all the heat due to the chemical reaction, and if the expansion and compression were adiabatic, the theoretical indicator diagram of an engine of the Otto type would have the form shown in <,p>  fig. I46. OA represents the volume of clearance ; AB is the admission, at atmospheric pressure ; BC is the compression (which is assumed to be adiabatic) ; CD is the rise of pressure caused by explosion ; DE is adiabatic expansion during the working stroke ; and EBA is the exhaust. The height of the point D above C may be calculated when we know the temperature at C (an element of considerable uncertainty in practice), the specific heat (at constant volume) of the burnt mixture, the amount of heat evolved by explosion, and the change of specific density due to the change of chemical constitution which explosion brings about. With the proportion of coal-gas and air ordinarily employed this last consideration may generally be neglected, as the volume of the products would differ by less than 2 per cent. from the volume of the mixture before explosion if both were reduced to the same pressure and <,p>  temperature. <,p>  257.

An actual diagram from an Otto engine working in its normal manner is given in fig. I47, where the reference letters distinguish the parts of a complete cycle, as in fig. I46. It shows a rapid rise of pressure on explosion, so rapid that the volume has not very materially altered when the maximum of pressure is reached ; and the specific heat at constant volume may therefore be used without serious error in calculating the amount of heat which this rise accounts for. When this calculation is made,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="42"> See two important papers by Mr Dugald Clerk, “ Οn the Theory of the Gas- Engine,” and “ Οn the Explosion of Homogeneous Gaseous Mixtures,” <hi rend="italic">Min.

Reference should also be made, on the subject of gas- engines generally, to Mr Clerk’s book. <hi rend="italic">The Gas-Engine, <,hi> I886. <,note> it turns out that only about 6O or 7O per cent. of the potential heat of combustion in the mixture is required to produce the rise of temperature corresponding to the point of greatest pressure. The remainder continues to be slowly evolved during the subsequent expansion of the hot gases. The process of combustion—a term evidently more appropriate than explosion <,p>  —is essentially gradual; when ignition takes place it begins rapidly, but it continues to go on at a diminishing rate throughout the stroke. That part which takes place after the maximum pressure is passed is the phenomenon of after-burning to which allusion has been made above. <,p>  258. The existence of “after-burning” is proved not only by the fact that the maximum pressure after ignition is much less than it would be if combustion were then complete, but also by the form which the curve of subsequent expansion takes. During expansion the gases are losing much heat by conduction through the cylinder walls. The water-jacket absorbs rather more than half of the whole heat developed in the engine,<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="42"> Clerk, <hi rend="italic">loc. cit. <,hi> Also, Brooks and Steward, <hi rend="italic">Van Nostrand’s Eng.

C.E., I884. <,note> and the greater part of this is of course taken up from the gases during the working stroke. Notwithstanding this loss, the curve of expansion does not fall much below the adiabatic curve ; in some cases it even lies higher than the adiabatic curve. This shows that the loss to the sides of the cylinder is being made up by continued development of heat within the gas. The process of combustion is especially protracted when the explosive mixture is weak in gas ; the point of <,p>  maximum pressure then comes late in the stroke ; and it is probable that the products which are discharged in the exhaust contain some incompletely-burnt fuel. Fig. I48 is the indicator diagram of an Otto engine supplied with a mixture containing an exceptionally large proportion of air : it exhibits well the <,p>  very gradual character of the explosion in such a case. <,p>  259. Much light has been thrown on this subject by the experiments of Mr Clerk, who has exploded mixtures of gas and air, and also mixtures of hydrogen and air, in a closed vessel furnished with an apparatus for recording the time-rate of variation of pressure. In these experiments the pressure fell after the explosion only on account of the cooling action of the containing walls. The temperature before ignition being known, it became possible to calculate from the diagrams of pressure the highest temperature reached during combustion (on the assumption that the specific heat of the gases remained unchanged <,p>  at high temperatures), and to compare this with the temperature which would have been produced had combustion been at once complete. Mixtures of gas and air were exploded, the proportion of gas varying from,to,, and the highest temperature produced was generally a little more than half that which would have been reached by instantaneous combustion of the mixture. With the best proportion of coal-gas to air (I to 6 or 7) the greatest pressure and hottest state was found one-twentieth of a second after ignition, and the temperature was then I8OO° C.,—instead of 38OO° , which would have been the value had all the heat been at once evolved. With the weakest mixtures about half a second was taken to reach a maximum of temperature, and its value was 8OO° C., instead of I8OO° C. In this case, however, the degree of completeness of the combustion is not fairly shown by a comparison of these temperatures, since much cooling occurred during the relatively long interval that preceded the instant of greatest pressure. <,p>  26O. Ίο explain the phenomenon of after-burning or delayed combustion, it has been supposed that the high temperature to which the gases are raised in the first stages of the explosion prevents union from being completed,—just as high temperature would dissociate the burnt gases were they already in chemical union,—until the fall of temperature by expansion and by the cooling action of the cylinder walls allows the process of union to go on. The maximum temperature attained in the gas- engine is high enough to cause a perceptible amount of dissociation of the burnt products ; it may therefore be admitted that this explanation of delayed combustion is to some extent true. On the other hand, the phenomenon is most noticeable with mixtures weak in gas, in which the maximum temperature reached is low, and the dissociation effect is correspondingly small. It appears, therefore, that dissociation is not the main cause of the action ; apart from it the process of combustion of a gaseous mixture is gradual, beginning fast and going on at a continuously-diminishing rate as the combustible mixture becomes more and more diluted by the portions already burnt. If the mixture is much diluted to begin with, the process is comparatively slow from the first. <,p>  26I. Much stress has been laid by some makers of gas- engines on the desirability of having a stratified mixture of gases in the cylinder, with a part rich in gas near the ignition port and a greater proportion of residual product or air near the piston. It has even been supposed that stratification of the gases is the cause of their gradual combustion. Mr Clerk’s experiments are conclusive against this ; the mixtures he used, which gave in some cases very gradual explosions, were allowed to stand long enough to become sensibly homogeneous. In dealing with weak mixtures it is no doubt of advantage to have a small quantity of richer fluid close to the igniting port to start the ignition of the rest,—but beyond this stratification has probably little or no value. And it may be questioned whether, in the ordinary working of a gas-engine, any general stratification can occur, when account is taken of the commotion which the air and gas cause as they rush into the cylinder at a speed exceeding that of an express train. <,p>  262. A compression gas-engine of the Otto type burns from 2O to 25 cubic feet of coal-gas per hour per indicated horse-power. Good coal-gas has a heating power equivalent to about 5OO,OOO foot-pounds per cubic foot, and hence, with a consumption of 2O cubic feet the efficiency which the engine realizes is nearly O·2. The efficiency of a large steam-engine is about O·I4, and in steam-engines that are small enough to be fairly compared with actual gas-engines the efficiency is not more than O·I.

Inst. <,hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> C.E., <,hi> vol. lxxiii. p. 3II. <,note> which is produced by passing a mixture of superheated steam and air through red-hot anthracite, is used to drive an Otto engine, the consumption of coal has been found to be only I·I lb per I.H.P. per hour, or less than half the amount used by a steam- engine of similar size. What gives this comparison additional interest is the fact that the gas-producer for a 4O or 5O H.P. engine need not take up more space than the boiler of a steam-engine of the same power. <,p>  263. In another sense the gas-engine is much less perfect than the steam-engine. The actual efficiency of the latter is about half the ideal efficiency which a perfect engine would show when working through the same range of temperature. In the gas-engine the actual is less than one-fourth of the ideal efficiency. Taking the highest temperature as I9OO° C.—a value reached in some of Mr Clerk’s experiments—and the lowest temperature as I5° C., the efficiency of a perfect engine would be O·87, while that of the actual engine is O·2. This only means that the gas-engine has all the greater margin for future improvement. <,p>  264. At present the main causes of waste in gas-engines are the action of the sides of the cylinder and the water- <,p>  jacket, and the high temperature of the exhaust gases. The water-jacket absorbs about half the whole heat, only to keep the cylinder cool enough to permit of lubrication. The waste gases are discharged at a temperature of about 42O° C., and so carry away a large amount of heat which might in part be saved by having a greater ratio of expansion, or by the use of a regenerator. Another source of thermodynamic imperfection is the after-burning, which gives heat to the working substance at a temperature lower than the maximum. <,p>  In an engine constructed by the late Sir William Siemens it was attempted to do away with or reduce the two main causes of loss—(I) by using a separate combustion-chamber, distinct from the cylinder in which the piston worked, and (2) by passing the exhaust gases through a regenerator, which afterwards gave up heat to the incoming air and gas.<note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="43"> Siemens, “Discussion on the Theory of the Gas-Engine,” <hi rend="italic">Min. Proc. Inst. C.E., <,hi> I882. <,note> The late Prof. Fleeming Jenkin endeavoured to attain the same ends by adapting the Stirling type of engine to internal combustion, a mixture of gas and air being exploded under a displacer like that of fig. I4I. Practical difficulties have hitherto prevented regenerative internal-combustion engines from coming into use, but it can scarcely be doubted that their development is only a question of time. With regard to the probable future of heat-engines, it is important to notice that the internal-combustion engine using gaseous fuel, though already much more efficient than the steam- engine, is crude and full of defects which further invention ought to remove, while the steam-engine has been improved so far that little increase in its efficiency can be expected, and more than a little is impossible.
