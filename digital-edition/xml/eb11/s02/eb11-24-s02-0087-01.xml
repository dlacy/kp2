The French <hi rend="italic">salon</hi> itself is formed from <hi rend="italic">salle,</hi> Ger. <hi rend="italic">Saal,</hi> hall, reception-room, represented in Old English by the cognate <hi rend="italic">sæl,</hi> hall, properly “ abiding-place,” from the root seen in Gothic <hi rend="italic">saljan,</hi> to dwell, cf. Russ. <hi rend="italic">selo,</hi> village. The word in its proper sense has now a somewhat archaistic flavour, being chiefly used of the 18th century, and it has come principally to be used (1) of the large rooms on passenger steamers; (2) on English railways of carriages for the accommodation of large parties not divided into compartments, and in the United States of the so-called “ drawing-room cars ”; and (3) of a bar or place for the sale of intoxicants.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
