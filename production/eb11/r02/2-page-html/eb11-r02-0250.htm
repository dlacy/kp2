<p><span class="font2">entrusted with the guardianship of his younger brothers. Interrupting his studies, he withdrew to Broglio, and by careful management disencumbered the family possessions. In 1847&nbsp;he founded the journal </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Palria,</span><span class="font2"> and addressed to the grand&nbsp;duke a memorial suggesting remedies for the difficulties of the&nbsp;state. In 1848 he was elected Gonfaloniere of Florence, but&nbsp;resigned on account of the anti-Liberal tendencies of the grand&nbsp;duke. As Tuscan minister of the interior in 1859 he promoted&nbsp;the union of Tuscany with Piedmont, which took place on the&nbsp;12th of March 1860. Elected Italian deputy in 1861, he succeeded&nbsp;Cavour in the premiership. As premier he admitted the Garibal-dian volunteers to the regular army, revoked the decree of exile&nbsp;against Mazzini, and attempted reconciliation with the Vatican;&nbsp;but his efforts were rendered ineffectual by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">non possumus&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">of the pope. Disdainful of the intrigues of his rival Rattazzi,&nbsp;he found himself obliged in 1862 to resign office, but returned&nbsp;to power in 1866. On this occasion he refused Napoleon III.’s&nbsp;offer to cede Venetia to Italy, on condition that Italy should&nbsp;abandon the Prussian alliance, and also refused the Prussian&nbsp;decoration of the Black Eagle because Lamarmora, author of the&nbsp;alliance, was not to receive it. Upon the departure of the French&nbsp;troops from Rome at the end of 1866 he again attempted to&nbsp;conciliate the Vatican with a convention, in virtue of which&nbsp;Italy would have restored to the Church the property of the&nbsp;suppressed religious orders in return for the gradual payment&nbsp;of £24,000,000. In order to mollify the Vatican he conceded&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">exequatur</span><span class="font2"> to forty-five bishops inimical to the Italian régime.&nbsp;The Vatican accepted his proposal, but the ItaHan Chamber&nbsp;proved refractory, and, though dissolved by Ricasoli, returned&nbsp;more hostile than before. Without waiting for a vote, Ricasoli&nbsp;resigned office and thenceforward practically disappeared from&nbsp;political life, speaking in the Chamber only upon rare occasions.&nbsp;He died at BrogHo on the 23rd of October 1880. His private life&nbsp;and public career were marked by the utmost integrity, and&nbsp;by a rigid austerity which earned him the name of the “ iron&nbsp;baron.” In spite of the failure of his ecclesiastical scheme, he&nbsp;remains one of the most noteworthy figures of the Italian&nbsp;Risorgimento.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RICCATI, JACOPO FRANCESCO, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Count</span><span class="font2"> (1676-1754), Italian mathematician, was born at Venice on the 8th of May 1676,&nbsp;and died at Treviso on the 15th of April 1754.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He studied at the university of Padua, where he graduated in 1696. His favourite pursuits were scientific, and his authority&nbsp;on all questions of practical science was referred to by the&nbsp;senate of Venice. He corresponded with many of the European&nbsp;savants of his day, and contributed largely to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Acla Erudi-torum</span><span class="font2"> of Leipzig. He was offered the presidency of the academy&nbsp;of science of St Petersburg; but he declined, preferring the&nbsp;leisure and independence of life in Italy. RiccatPs name is best&nbsp;known in connexion with his problem caUcd RiccatPs equation,&nbsp;published in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Acla Erudilorum,</span><span class="font2"> September 1724. A very&nbsp;complete account of this equation and its various transformations was given by J. W. L. Glaisher in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Phil. Trans.</span><span class="font2"> (1881).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After Riccati’s death his works were collected by his sons and published (1758) in four volumes. His sons, Vincenzo (1707-1775) and Giordano (1709-1790), inherited his talents. The&nbsp;former was professor of mathematics at Bologna, and published,&nbsp;among other works, a treatise on the infinitesimal calculus.&nbsp;Giordano was distinguished both as a mathematician and an&nbsp;architect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RICCI, MATTEO (1552-1610), ItaHan missionary to China, was born of a noble family at Macerata in the March of Ancona on&nbsp;the 7th of October 1552. After some education at a Jesuit&nbsp;college in his native town he went to study law at Rome, where&nbsp;in 1571, in opposition to his father’s wishes, he joined the Society&nbsp;of Jesus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1577 Ricci and other students offered themselves for the East Indian missions. Ricci, without visiting his family to take&nbsp;leave, proceeded to Portugal. His comrades were Rudolfo&nbsp;Acquaviva, Nicolas Spinola, Francesco Pasio and Michcle&nbsp;Ruggieri, all afterwards, like Ricci himself, famous in the Jesuit&nbsp;annals. They arrived at Goa in September 1578. After four&nbsp;years spent in India, Ricci was summoned to the task of opening&nbsp;China to evangelization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Z Several fruitless attempts had been made by Xavier, and since his death, to introduce the Church into China,—as by&nbsp;Melchior Nunes of the Jesuit Society operating from Sanchian@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>in 1555; by Gaspar da Cruz, a Dominican, in that or the follow-ing year; by the Augustinians under Martin Herrada, 1575;&nbsp;and in 1579 by the Franciscans led by Pedro d’Alfaro. In 1571&nbsp;a house of the Jesuits had been set up at Macao (where the&nbsp;Portuguese were estabHshed in 1557), but their attention was&nbsp;then occupied with Japan, and it was not till the arrival at&nbsp;Macao of Alessandro Valignani on a visitation in 1582 that work&nbsp;in China was reaUy taken up. For this object he had obtained&nbsp;the services first of M. Ruggieri and then of Ricci. After various&nbsp;disappointments they found access to Chow-king-fu on the Si-Kiang or West River of Canton, where the viceroy of the two&nbsp;provinces of Kwang-tung and Kwang-si then had his residence,&nbsp;and by his favour were able to establish themselves there for&nbsp;some years. Their proceedings were very cautious and tentative;&nbsp;they excited the curiosity and interest of even the more intelligent Chinese by their clocks, their globes and maps, their books&nbsp;of European engravings, and by Ricci’s knowledge of mathematics, including dialling and the projection of maps. They&nbsp;conciliated some influential friends, and their reputation spread&nbsp;widely in China. This was facflitated by the Chinese system of&nbsp;transfer of pubHc officers from one province of the empire to&nbsp;another, and in the later movements of the missionaries they&nbsp;frequently met with one and another of their old-acquaintances&nbsp;in office, who were more or less well disposed. Eventually&nbsp;troubles at Chow-king compelled them to seek a new home; and&nbsp;in 1589, with the viceroy’s sanction, they migrated to Chang-chow in the northern part of Kwang-tung, not far from the well-known Meiling Pass;.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During his stay here Ricci was convinced that a mistake had been made in adopting a dress resembling that of the bonzes,&nbsp;a class who were the objects either of superstition or of contempt.&nbsp;With the sanction of the visitor it was ordered that in future the&nbsp;missionaries should adopt the costumes of Chinese literates,&nbsp;and, in fact, they before long adopted Chinese manners altogether.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Chang-chow, as a station, did not prove a happy selection, but it was not till 1595 that an opportunity occurred of travelling&nbsp;northward. For some time Ricci’s residence was at Nan-chan g-fu,<sup>!</sup> the capital of Kiang-si; but in 1598 he was able to proceed&nbsp;under favourable conditions to Nan-king, and thence for the&nbsp;first time to Peking, which had aU along been the goal of his&nbsp;missionary ambition. But circumstances were not then propitious, and the party had to return to Nan-king. The fame of&nbsp;the presents which they carried had, however, reached the court,&nbsp;and the Jesuits were summoned north again, and on the 24th of&nbsp;January 1601 they entered the capital. Wan-Η, the emperor&nbsp;of the Ming dynasty, in those days lived in seclusion, and saw no&nbsp;one but his women and the eunuchs. But the missionaries were&nbsp;summoned to the palace; their presents were immensely admired, and the emperor had the curiosity to send for portraits&nbsp;of the fathers themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">They obtained a settlement, with an allowance for subsistence, in Peking, and from this time to the end of his Hfe Ricci’s&nbsp;estimation among the Chinese was constantly increasing, as was&nbsp;at the same time the amount of his labours. Visitors thronged&nbsp;the mission house incessantly; and inquiries came to him from&nbsp;all parts of the empire respecting the doctrines which he taught,&nbsp;or the numerous Chinese publications which he issued. This&nbsp;in itself was a great 'burden, as Chinese composition, if wrong&nbsp;impressions are to be avoided, demands extreme care and&nbsp;accuracy. As head of the mission, which now had four stations</span></p><div>
