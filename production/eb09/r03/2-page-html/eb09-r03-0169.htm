<p><span class="font1">dreaming that, as he is about to inscribe in all modesty his name upon the threshold of the temple of glory, the goddess or fiend&nbsp;of Envy obstructs him, and a long interchange of reciprocal objurgations ensues. Here occurs the highly-charged portrait of the&nbsp;chief Roman detractor of Salvator (we are not aware that he has&nbsp;ever been identified by name) ; and the painter protests that he&nbsp;would never condescend to do any of the lascivious work in painting so shamefully in vogue.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROSAMOND, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fair.</span><span class="font2"> Rosamond Clifford, mistress of Henry IL, was the daughter of Sir Walter Clifford, a&nbsp;Berkshire knight (Dugdale, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Monasticon,</span><span class="font2"> iv. 366). She&nbsp;appears to have died in or about the year 1177, and was&nbsp;buried in the nunnery at Godstow. At the command of&nbsp;St Hugh, bishop of Lincoln, her body was removed from&nbsp;the church in which it had been buried, and was interred&nbsp;again outside the church. Such are all the facts that are&nbsp;known about Fair Rosamond. She is said to have been&nbsp;the mother of William Longsword, and of Geoffrey, archbishop of York. But this is impossible, for both William&nbsp;and Geoffrey -were born before 1155, and Rosamond was&nbsp;still a girl at the time of her death. The story of the&nbsp;labyrinth or maze built by Henry to conceal her from&nbsp;Queen Eleanor occurs first in Brompton (end of 12th&nbsp;century). The legend of her death at Queen Eleanor’s&nbsp;hand is variously related, but does not appear to be traceable beyond the first half of the 14th century. It can&nbsp;hardly be true in any form, for Eleanor was in confinement&nbsp;during the last fifteen years of Henry’s reign.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSARIO, a river-port on the Paranâ, and the chief town of a department in the province of Santa Fé in the&nbsp;Argentine Republic, 186 miles by river from Buenos&nbsp;Ayres. In 1853 an insignificant village, with less than four&nbsp;thousand inhabitants, it now ranks in commercial importance as the second city in the republic, being the centre&nbsp;of almost the entire trade of the eleven provinces lying&nbsp;between the Paranâ and the Andes and the terminus of&nbsp;the great railways which since 1863 have gradually been&nbsp;pushed further north and west to Cordoba (1870),&nbsp;Tucuman (1876), Mendoza (1884), and San Juan (1885).&nbsp;The population had increased to 21,000 by 1870 and to&nbsp;45,000 in 1883, while the imports in the latter year reached&nbsp;the value of £4,560,000 and the exports £3,780,000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rosario stands about 65 feet above the level of the river. It is laid out chess-board fashion ; and the streets&nbsp;are paved, and lighted with gas (introduced in 1869).&nbsp;The area, 145 acres in 1870, is now about 2000 acres.&nbsp;Brick is the principal building material, and the houses&nbsp;are mostly of one story. There are no suburbs, the city&nbsp;terminating abruptly on the great plain. The industrial&nbsp;establishments are extensive foundries, a large number of&nbsp;brick kilns, a jam and fruit-preserving factory, breweries,&nbsp;tanneries, soap-works, saw-mills, and flour-mills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rosario was founded in 1725 by Don Francisco Godoy as a settlement of “reduced” CalChaqui Indians, and the parish was&nbsp;established in 1731 and dedicated to Our Lady of the Rosary,&nbsp;whose colours, blue and white, were adopted in 1813 as those of the&nbsp;national flag. The prosperity of the town dates from 1854, when&nbsp;it was made a port of entry by General Urquiza. In 1867 and&nbsp;1868 it suffered from a severe cholera plague. The proposal to&nbsp;make Rosario the capital of the republic instead of Buenos Ayres&nbsp;has more than once been nearly carried in the legislature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSARY </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Rosarium,</span><span class="font2"> Germ. Rosenkranz) is defined in the Roman </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rreviary</span><span class="font2"> as a series of one hundred and fifty&nbsp;repetitions of the “ Ave Maria,” with a “ Pater Noster ”&nbsp;interpolated after each decade, the whole exercise being&nbsp;accompanied with pious meditation on the mysteries of&nbsp;redemption. This particular method of devotion, though&nbsp;said to have been not altogether unknown previously, first&nbsp;became extensively popular through St Dominic, who was&nbsp;admonished by the Virgin Mary to preach the rosary as</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">a special defence against heresy and vice. The Feast of the Rosary of the Blessed Virgin (Duplex Majus—first&nbsp;Sunday in October) was instituted by Clement XI. to&nbsp;commemorate the successes of the Christian arms against&nbsp;the Turks in 1716 ; it has reference also to the battle of&nbsp;Lepanto (Oct. 7, 1571). The word “ rosary ” or “ chaplet ”&nbsp;(capellina) is also employed to denote the string of beads&nbsp;of larger and smaller size by the use of which in repeating&nbsp;the rosary the faithful secure the due alternation of Ave&nbsp;Marias with Pater Nosters. In strict language the word&nbsp;chaplet is applied only to the “ lesser ” rosary, consisting&nbsp;of but fifty Aves and five Pater Nosters. Similar expedients to assist the memory in complex repetitions occur&nbsp;among Mohammedans and Buddhists : in the former case&nbsp;the so-called sobha has ninety-nine beads, and is used for&nbsp;the pious repetition of the ninety-nine names which express&nbsp;the attributes of God.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSAS, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jüan Manuel de,</span><span class="font2"> born at Buenos Ayres March 30, 1793, died in England March 14, 1877 (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Argentine Republic,</span><span class="font2"> vol. ii. p. 491).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSCELLINUS (also written </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rousselin</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ruce-linus),</span><span class="font2"> often called the founder of nominalism (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Scholasticism),</span><span class="font2"> was born in Armorica or Lower Brittany&nbsp;somewhere about the middle of the llth century. Our&nbsp;information about his life is scanty, and, as he appears to&nbsp;have written nothing, we are dependent for a knowledge&nbsp;of his doctrine upon the statements of his opponents and&nbsp;the cursory statements of later writers. He studied at&nbsp;Soissons and Rheims, was afterwards attached to the&nbsp;cathedral of Chartres, and became canon of Compiègne.&nbsp;It seems most probable that Roscellinus was not strictly&nbsp;the first to promulgate nominalistic doctrines; but in&nbsp;his exposition they received more definite expression, and,&nbsp;being applied to the dogma of the Trinity, attracted&nbsp;universal attention. The chief opponent of Roscellinus&nbsp;was Anselm of Canterbury, w<sup>r</sup>ho defended at once the&nbsp;realistic doctrine of universals and the orthodox tradition&nbsp;of the church. It appears from the polemic of Anselm&nbsp;that “ the heretics in dialectic ” whom he combats denied&nbsp;the substantial reality of universals, asserting, for example,&nbsp;that colour has no real existence except as coloured body.&nbsp;There is no reason, however, to suppose that Roscellinus&nbsp;meant thereby to deny the real existence of attributive&nbsp;differences in things, though Anselm endeavours to involve&nbsp;him in that consequence. But we may conclude from the&nbsp;censure of his pupil Abelard that his reaction against&nbsp;realism had led Roscellinus into rashness of expression.&nbsp;In conformity with his general nominalistic position,&nbsp;Roscellinus taught that whatever exists as a real thing or&nbsp;substance exists as one self-identical whole, and is not&nbsp;susceptible of division into parts. This was the part of&nbsp;his teaching which created so much scandal when applied&nbsp;to the doctrine of the Trinity. Roscellinus maintained&nbsp;that it is merely a habit of speech which prevents outspeaking of the three persons as three substances or three&nbsp;Gods. If it were otherwise, and the three persons were&nbsp;really one substance or thing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(fitηa res),</span><span class="font2"> we should be&nbsp;forced to admit that the Father and the Holy Spirit&nbsp;became incarnate along with the Son. Roscellinus seems&nbsp;to have put forward this doctrine in perfect good faith,&nbsp;and to have claimed for it at first the authority of Lanfranc&nbsp;and Anselm. In 1092, however, a council convoked by&nbsp;the archbishop of Rheims condemned his interpretation,&nbsp;and Roscellinus, who was in danger of being lynched by&nbsp;the orthodox populace, recanted his error. As his enforced&nbsp;penitence did not prove lasting, his opinions were condemned by a second council (1094), and he himself fled&nbsp;to England. Forced by a fresh persecution to return to&nbsp;France at a later date, he taught at Tours and Loc-menach&nbsp;in Brittany (where he had Abelard as a pupil), and resided</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
