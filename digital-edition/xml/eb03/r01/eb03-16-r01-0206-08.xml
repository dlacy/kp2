                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rheum,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Rhubarb:</hi> A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to
                    the enrteandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the
                    12th order, <hi rend="italic">Holora-ceœ.</hi> There is no calyx ; the corolla
                    is ſexſid and per-ſiftent ; and there is one triquetrous ſeed. There are ſive
                    ſpecies, viz. 1. The rhaponticum, or common rhubarb, hath a large, thick,
                    fleſhy, branching, deeply-ffriking root, yellowiſh within ; crowned by very
                    large, roundiſh, heart-ſhaped ſmooth leaves, on thick, ſſightly-ſurrowed
                    foot-ſtalks : and an upright ſtrong ſtem, two or three feet high, adorned with
                    leaves ſingly, and terminated by thick cloſe ſpikes of white flowers. It grows »
                    in Thrace and Scythia, but has been long in the Engliſh gardens. Its root
                    affords a gentle purge. It is however of inferior quality to ſome of the
                    following ſorts ; but the plant being aſtringent, its young ſtalks in ſpring,
                    being cut and peeled, are ilfed for tarts. 2. The palmatum, palmated-leaved true
                    Chineſe rhubarb, hath a thick fleſhy root, yellow within ; crowned with very
                    large palmated leaves, being deeply divided into acuminated ſegments, expanded
                    like an open hand ; upright ſtems, ſive or ſix feet high or more, terminated by
                    large ſpſkes of flowers<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial"

                <p>ved to be the true foreign rhubarb, the purgative qua-lity of which is well
                    known. 3. The compactum, or Tartarian rhubarb, hath a large, fleſhy, branched
                    root, yellow within ; crowned by very large, heart-ſhaped fomewhat lobated,
                    ſharply indented, ſmooth leaves, and an upright large ſtem, five or ſix feet
                    high, garniſhed with leaves ſingly, and branching above ; having all the
                    branches terminated by nodding panicles of white flowers. This has been ſuppoſed
                    to be the true rhubarb ; which, however, though of ſuperior quality to ſome
                    ſorts, is accounted inferior to the rheum palmatum.</p>
                <p>4. The undulatum, undulated, or waved-leaved Chineſe rhubarb, hath a thick,
                    branchy, deep-ſtriking root, yellow within ; crowned with large, oblong,
                    undulate, fomewhat hairy leaves, having equal foot-ſtalks, and an upright firm
                    ſtem, four feet high ; garniſhed with leaves ſingly, and terminated by long
                    looſe ſpikes of whlte flowers, 5. The Arabian ribes, or currant rhu-barb of
                    Mount Libanus, hath a thick fieſhy root, very broad leaves, full of granulated
                    protuberances, and with equal ſoot-ſtalks, and upright ſirm ſtems, three or four
                    feet high, terminated by ſpikes of flowers, ſucceeded by berry-nke ſeeds, being
                    ſurrounded by a purple pulp« All theſe plants are perennial in root, and the
                    leaves and ſtalks are annual. The roots being thick, fleihy, gene-rally divided,
                    ſtrike deep into the ground ; of a browrt-iſh colour without and yellow within :
                    the leaves riſe in the ſpring, generally come up in a large head folded</p>

                <p>together, gradually expanding themſelves, having thick foot-ſtalks ; and grow
                    from one to two feet high, or more, in length and breadth, ſpreading all round :
                    'amidſt them rife the flower-ſtems, which are garniſhed at each joint by one
                    leaf, and are of ſtrong and expeditious .growth, attaining their full height in
                    June, when they flower ; and are ſucceeded by large triangular ſeeds, ripening
                    in Auguſt. Some plants of each fort merit cub ture in gardens for variety ; they
                    will effect a ſingula-rity with their luxuriant foliage, ſpikes, and flowers :
                    and as medical plants, they demand culture both for private and public uſe.</p>
                <p>They are generally propagated by ſeeds ſowed ſu au-tumn ſoon after they are
                    ripe, or early in the ſpring, in any open bed of light deep earth ; remarking,
                    thoſe intended for medical ufe ſhould generally be ſowed where they are to
                    remain, that the roots, being not diſturbed by removal, may grow large. Scatter
                    the ſeeds thinly, either by broad-caſt all over the· ſurface, and raked well in
                    ; or in ſhallow drills a foot and half diſtance, covering them near an inch
                    deep. The plants will rife in the fpring, but not flower till the ſecond or
                    third year : when they, however, are come up two or three inches high, thin them
                    to eight or ten inches, and clear out all weeds ; though thoſe deſſgned always
                    to ſtand ſhould afterwards be hoed out to a foot and a half or two ſeet diſtance
                    : obſerving, if any arc required ſor the pleaſure ground, &amp;c. for
                    variety, they ſhould be transplanted where they are to remain in autumn, when
                    their leaves decay, or early in ſpring, before they ſhoot: the others remaining
                    where ſowed, muſt have the ground kept clean between them ; and in autumn, when
                    the leaves and ſtalks decay, cut them down, and ſſightly dig the ground between
                    the rows of plants^ repeating the ſame work every year.. The roots remaining,
                    they increaſe in ſize annually : and in the fécond or third veal-many of them
                    will ſhoot up ſtalks, flower, and perfect ſeeds ; and in three or four years
                    tile roots will be arrived to a large ſize ; though older roots are generally
                    preferable for medical uſe. .</p>
                <p>In Mr Bell’s Travels we have an account of ſome curious particulars relating to
                    the culture of rhubarb. He tells us, that the beſt rhubarb grows in that part of
                    Eaſtern Tartary called <hi rend="italic">Mongalia,</hi> which now ſerves as a
                    boundary between Ruffia and China. The marmots contribute greatly to the culture
                    of the rhubarb, wherever you ſee io or 20 plants growing, you are ſure of
                    finding ſeveral burrows under the ſhades of their broad-ſp reading leaves.
                    Perhaps they may fometimes eat the leaves and roots of this plant ; however, it
                    is probable the manure they leave about the roots contributes not a little to
                    its increaſe ; and their caſting up the earth, makes it ſhoot out young buds and
                    multiply. This plant does not run, and ſpread itſelf, like clocks and others of
                    the ſame ſpecies ; but grows in tufts, at uncertain diſtances, as if the feeds
                    had been dropped with defign. It appears that the Mon-gals never accounted it
                    worth cultivating ; but that the world is obliged to tlie marmots for the
                    quantities ſcattered, at random, in many parts of this coun-try : for whatever
                    part of tile ripe ſeed happens to be blown among the thick graſs, can very
                    ſeldom reach the ground, but muſt there wither and die ; whereas, Should it ſall
                    among the looſe earth thrown up by the marmots, it immediately takes root, and
                    produces a new plant.</p>
                <p>After digging and gathering the rhubarb, the Mon-gals cut the large roots into
                    ſmall pieces, in order to make them dry more readily. In the middle of every
                    piece they ſcoop a hole, through which a cord is drawn, in order to ſufpend them
                    in any convenient place. They hang them for the moſt part about their tents, and
                    fometimes on the horns of their ſheep. This is a moſt pernicious cuſtom, as it
                    deſtroys ſome of the beſt part or the root : ſor all about the hole is rotten
                    and uſeleſs; whereas, were people rightly informed how to dig and dry this
                    plant, there would not be one pound of refuſe in an hundred ; which would ſave a
                    great deal of trouble and expence, that much diminiſh the profits on this
                    commodity.. At preſent, the dealers in this article think theſe improvements not
                    worthy of their attention, as their gains are more conſiderable on this than on
                    any other branch of trade. Perhaps the government may hereafter think it proper
                    to make ſome regulations with regard to this matter.</p>
                <p>Two forts of rhubarb are met with in the ſhops. ſſ he ſirſt is imported from
                    Turkey and Ruffia, in roundiſh pieces freed from the bark,-with a hole through
                    the middle of each ; they are externally of a yellowiſh colour, and on cutting
                    appear variegated with lively reddiſh ſtreaks. 1 he other, which is leſs
                    eſteemed, comes immediately from the Eaſt Indies, in longiſh pieces, harder,
                    heavier, and more compact than the foregoing. The firſt ſort, unleſs kept very
                    dry, is apt to grow mouldy and worm-eaten ; the ſecond is lefs ſubject· to theſe
                    inconveniences. Some of the more mduſtrious artiſts are ſaid to fill up the
                    worm-holes with certain mixtures, and to colour the outfide of the damaged
                    pieces with powder of the finer ſorts of rhubarb, and ſometimes wlth cheaper
                    materials : this is often ſo nicely done, as effectually to impoſe upon the
                    buyer, unleſs he very carefully examines each piece. The marks of good rhubarb
                    are, that it be firm and ſolid, but not flinty ; that it be eaſtly pulverable,
                    and appear, when powdered, of a fine bright yellow colour j that, upon being
                    chewed, it impart to the fpittle a ſaffron tinge, without proving ſiimy or
                    mucilaginous m the mouth. Its taſte is ſubacrid, bitteriih, and fomewhat
                    aſtringent ; the ſmell lightly aromatic.</p>
                <p>Rhubarb is a mild cathartic, which operates without violence or irritation, and
                    may be given with ſafety even to pregnant women and children. - .Beſides its
                    purgative quality, it is celebrated for an aſtringent one, by which it
                    ſtrengthens the tone of the ſtomach and mteſtines, and proves ufeful in
                    diarrhoeas and diſorders proceeding from a laxity of the ſibres. Rhubarb in
                    ſubſtance operates more powerfully as a cathartic than any of the preparations
                    of it. watery tinctures purge more than the ſpirituous ones; whilſt the latter
                    contain in greater perfection the aromatic, aſtringent, and corro-borating
                    virtues of the rhubarb. The doſe, when intended as a purgative, is from a
                    ſcruple to a dram or more.</p>
                <p>The Turkey rhubarb is, among ns,, univerſally preferred to the Eaſt India fort,
                    though this laſt is for lome purpoſes at leaſt equal to the others lt ls
                    mani-ſeſtly more aſtringent, but has fomewhat Ieſs of an aromatic flavour.
                    Tinctures drawn from both with.· rectified ſpirit have nearly the fame taſte ;

                <p>oſſ the menſtmum, the extract left from the tincture of the Eaſt India rhubarb
                    proved conſiderably the ftrongeſt.</p>
                <p>Rhubarb has been cultivated of late in this country with conſiderable ſucceſs,
                    and for medical purpoſes is ſound to equal that of foreign growth, as is proved
                    hy the Tranſactions of the London Society for encoura-ging Arts, Manufactures,
                    and Commerce, who have re-warded ſeveral perſons both for cultivating and curing
                    it. In the Tranſactions ſor 1792, the gold medal was adjudged to Sir william
                    Fordyce, for raiſing from ſeed in the year 1791 upwards oſ 300 plants of the
                    true rhubarb, or rheum palmatum of the London Pharmacopoeia 1788, which in the
                    ſecond and third weeks of October were tranſplanted into a deep loam, at four
                    ſeet diſtance from each other, according to rules laid down by the ſociety. In
                    1793 it was adjudged to Mr Thomas Jones, from whofe papers we derive the
                    follow-ing information.</p>
                <p>After giving an accurate account of his experiments and obſervations, he
                    concludes, that the ſeaſon ſor ſowing is the ſpring about March or April, or in
                    autumn about Auguſt and September; that thoſe plants which are raiſed in the
                    ſpring ſhould be tranſplanted in autumn, and <hi rend="italic">vice verſa ;</hi> that they cannot have too much room ; that room and time are eſſentially
                    neceffary to their be-ing large, off a good appearance, and perhaps to the
                    in-creaſe of their purgative qualities ; that to effect theſe purpoſes, the foil
                    muſt be hght, loamy, and rich, but not too much ſo, leſt the roots ſhould be too
                    fibrous ; that their ſituation can ſcarcely be too dry, as more ' evils are to
                    be expected from a ſuperabundancy of moiſture than any actual want of it : and
                    laſtly, we may conclude, that in particular the injuries which they are fubject
                    to are principally during their inſancy, and. to be imputed to infects and
                    inattention to the planting ſeaſon ; afterwards, from too great an expoſure to
                    froſt : but that none can be dreaded from heat ; and that in general they are
                    hardy and eaſy of cultivation, when arrived beyond a certain term.</p>
                <p>The method of curing rhubarb, as propoſed by Dr Tirruogel of Stockholm, is as
                    follows: " No roots ſhould be taken up till they have been planted ten years :
                    they ſhonld be taken out of the ground either in winter, before the froſt ſets
                    in, or in the beginning of ſpring, and immediately cut into pieces, and
                    carefully barked ; let them be ſpread upon a table ſor three or four days, and
                    be frequently turned, that the juices may thicken or condenſe within the roots.
                    After this procefs, make a hole in each piece, and put a thread through it ; by
                    which let them hang ſeparately, either within doors, or in ſome ſheltereſt ſhady
                    ſhed. Some perſons dry them in a different way : they incloſe the roots in clay,
                    and make a hole in the clay, about the thickneſs of a gooſe-quill, and in this
                    manner bang up each piece to dry ſeparately, that the moiſture may not
                    evaporate, nor the ſtrength of the root be weakened. But the methods which the
                    Tartars follow is a bad one : they dig the roots out of the deſerts where they
                    grow, bark them, and immediately ſtring them, and hang them round the necks of
                    their camels, that they may dry as they travel ; but this greatly leſſens the
                    medicinal virtue of the root.”</p>
                <p>Mr Thomas Halley of Pontefract in Yorkſhire, to whom the London Society voted
                    the ſilver medal in</p>
                <p>1793, inſorms us, that his father tried various experiments for curing rhubarb,
                    as waſhing, bruſhing, bark-ing, and peeling, and he dried them in the ſun, on a
                    kiln, in a ſtove, or in a warm kitchen. But of the ſuc-ceſs of all or either of
                    theſe methods we have no ac-count, owing to the death of Mr Halley’s father. He
                    ſent, however,to them ſive different ſpecimens, which the Society acknowledges
                    to be ſuperſor to any rhubarb hitherto cured in England, and produced to them.
                    The roots ſent, Mr Halley ſays, were planted about the year 1781 in a light
                    ſandyiſh foil, but were much neglected. They were taken up in the ſpring of
                    1792, and being thoroughly diveſted of the adhering earth, were placed for ſome
                    weeks on the floor of a cool ware-houſe : the ſibres were then taken off, cut
                    up, and dried on the flue of a green-llouſe ; but, from miſmanage-ment, were
                    entirely ſpoiled. The prime roots were fevered in ſmall pieces, peeled clean,
                    and thoroughly cleared of every particle of unſoundneſs. Part was ſeparately
                    laid in lieves, and the remainder perforated, ſtrung, and ſuſpended in ſeſtoons

                <p>In the year 1794 the Society adjudged the gold medal to Mr william Hayward of
                    Hanbury, Oxford-ſhire, for propagating rhubarb by offsets taken from the crowns
                    of large plants, inſtead of ſeeds, for the pur-poſe of bringing it to perfection
                    in a ſhorter time, which fully anſwered his expectations. Mr Hayward was a
                    candidate in the year 1789 for the gold medal ; but having miſunderſtood their
                    rules, he was not entitled to it, though with great propriety they voted to him
                    the ſilver medal ; in confequence of which he ſent them his method of culture
                    and cure. His method of cultiva-ting Turkey rhubarb from ſeed is thus explained
                    to the Society : “ I have uſually ſown the feed about the beginning of February,
                    on a bed of good foil (if rather ſandy the better), expoſed to an eaſt or weſt
                    aſpect, in preference to the ſouth ; obſerving a full ſun to be prejudicial to
                    the vegetation of the feeds, and to the plants whilſt young. The ſeeds are beſt
                    ſown moderately thick (broaſhcaſt), treading them regularly in, as ia uſual with
                    parſueps and other light ſeeds, and then ra-king the ground ſmooth. I have
                    ſometimes, when the ſeaſon has been wet, made a bed for ſowing the rhu-barb
                    ſeeds upon, about two ſeet thick, with new dung from · the ſtable, covering it
                    near one foot thick with good foil. The intent of this bed is not for the ſake
                    of warmth, but ſolely to prevent the riſing of earthworms, which, in a moiſt
                    ſeaſon, will frequently deſtroy the young ciop. If the ſeed is good, the plants
                    often riſe too thick ; if ſo, when they have attained ſix leaves they ſhould be
                    taken carefully up (where too cloſe), leaving the ſtanding crop eight or ten
                    inches apart : thoſe taken up may be planted at the ſame diſtance, in a freſh
                    fpot of ground, in order to ſurniſh other plantations. when the plants in
                    general are grown to the ſizc that cabbage-plants are uſually ſet out for a
                    ſtanding crop, they are beſt planted where they are to remain, in beds four feet
                    wide, one row along the middle of the bed, leaving two yards diſtance betwixt
                    the</p>

                <p>plants, allowing an alley between the beds about a foot wide, for conveniency of
                    weeding the plants. In the autumn, when the decayed leaves are removed, if the
                    ſhoveling of the alleys are thrown over the crowns of the plants, it will be
                    found of ſervice.</p>
                <p>His mode of cultivating the fame plant by offsets is thus given : " On taking up
                    ſome plants the laff ſpiing, I flipped off ſeveral offsets from the heads of
                    large plants : theſe I ſet with a dibble about a foot apart, in order, if I
                    found them thrive, to remove them into other beds. On examining them in the
                    autumn, I was ſurpriſed to ſee the progreſs they had made, and pleaſed to be
                    able to furniſh my beds with 40 plants in the moſt thriving ſtate. Though this
                    was my ſirſt experiment oſ its kind, I do not mean to arrogate the difcovery to
                    myſelf, having known it recently tried by others, but without being informed of
                    their ſucceſs. I have rea-ſon to think this valuable drug will, by this method,
                    be brought much ſooner to perfection than from ſeed.”</p>
                <p>His method of curing rhubarb is thus deſcribed : " The plants may be taken up
                    either early in the ſpring, or in autumn, when the leaves are decayed, in dry
                    wea-ther if poſſible, when the roots are to be cleared from dirt (without
                    waſhing) : let them be cut into pieces, and with a ſharp knife freed from the
                    outer coat, and expoſed to the ſun and air for a few days, to render the outſide
                    a little dry. In order to accelerate the curing of the largeſt pieces, a hole
                    may be ſcooped out with a penknife : thefe and the ſmaller parts are then to be
                    ſtrung on packthread, and hung up in a warm room ( I have always had the
                    conveniency of ſuch a one over a baker’s oven), where it is to remain till
                    perfectly dry. Each piece may be rendered more ſſghtly by a common file, fixing
                    it in a ſmall vice during that operation : afterwards rub over it a very ſine
                    powder, which the ſmall roots ſurniſh in beautiful perfection, for this and
                    every other purpoſe where rhubarb is required.”</p>
                <p>In the year 1794, too, the Society adjudged the gold medal to Mr Ball for his
                    method of curing the true rhubarb, which is as follows ; " I take the roots up
                    when I ſind the ſtalks withering or dying away, clean them from the earth with a
                    dry bruſh, cut them in ſmall pieces of about four or ſive inches in breadth, and
                    about two in depth, taking away all the bark, and make a hole in the middle, and
                    ſtring them on packthread, keeping every piece apart ; and every morning, if the
                    weather is clear and fine, I place them in the open part of the garden, on
                    ſtages, erected by fixing ſmall poſts about ſix feet high in the ground, and ſix
                    feet aſunder, into which I ſix horizontal pegs, about a foot apart, beginning at
                    the top ; and the rhubarb being ſtringed croſs-wiſe on ſmall poles, I place them
                    on theſe pegs ; ſo that if it ſhould rain, I could eaſily remove each pole with
                    the ſufpended pieces, into any covered place. I never ſuffer them to be out at
                    night, as the damps at this ſea-ſon would be apt to mould them ; and if at any
                    time I perceive the leaſt mark of mould, I rub it off with a dry cloth. In ſome
                    of the pieces of rhubarb which I have cured this year, I have made holes about
                    half an inch diameter in the middle, for the free paſſage of air, and have found
                    that every one of theſe pleces dried better than the others where no ſuch holes
                    were made ; and have likewife hung ſeveral ffrings in the kitchen, and never
                    expoſed them in the open air, and found them to dry exceedingly well, and much
                    better than thoſe in the open air. Some years ſince I dried a quantity of
                    rhubarb on a malt-kiln, keeping up the thermometer to 80 degrees, which anſwered
                    well, but I think rather dried too quick <hi rend="italic">ί</hi> the roots
                    which I have cured this year are a part of the plantation of 1789, aud for which
