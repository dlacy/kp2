<p><span class="font0">row ; but it is most generally used in a bad sense, and is ’ applied to persons who feel compunction for some great&nbsp;crime, as murder, and the like. Murders which have been&nbsp;committed with the utmost circumspection and secrecy,&nbsp;and the authors of which could never be discovered by any&nbsp;human investigation, have frequently been disclosed by the&nbsp;remorse and confession of the perpetrators, and that, too,&nbsp;many years afterwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REMPHAN, an idol or god whom St Stephen says the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Israelites worshipped in the wilderness as they passed from</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Egypt to the Land of Promise. “ Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan ; </span><span class="font0">figures which ye made to worship them.” That the martyr here quotes the following words of the prophet Amos,&nbsp;all commentators are agreed : “ Ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font0"> your images, the star of&nbsp;your god, which ye made to yourselves.” But if this coincidence between the Clnistian preacher and the Jewish&nbsp;prophet be admitted, it follows that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rcmphan&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">are two names of one and the same deity. This indeed is&nbsp;further evident from the Septuagint translators having substituted in their version the word Pα∕βαι&gt;, instead of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which we read in the Hebrew and English Bibles. But&nbsp;the question which still remains to be answered is, What&nbsp;god was worshipped by the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rcmphan, Raiphaft,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chitin</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan</span><span class="font0"> was an Egyptian divinity, cannot be questioned ; for at the era of the Exodus the Hebrew's must have been strangers to the idolatrous worship of all other nations ; nor are they ever accused of any other&nbsp;than Egyptian idolatries during their forty years’ wanderings in the wilderness, till towards the end of that period,&nbsp;when they became infected by the Moabites with the worship of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bαal-peor.</span><span class="font0"> That </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moloch, Moleh, Melek,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mil-cοm,</span><span class="font0"> in its original acceptation, denotes a king or chief, is&nbsp;known to every oriental scholar ; and therefore, when it is&nbsp;used as the name of a god, it undoubtedly signifies the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sun,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and is the same divinity with the Egyptian </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ra, Ré,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phrc.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Reasoning in this way, many critics, and we believe Selden&nbsp;amongst the number, have concluded that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chian,</span><span class="font0"> and of&nbsp;course </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan,</span><span class="font0"> is the planet Saturn ; because </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;written </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ciun, Cevan, Ceuan, Chevvin,</span><span class="font0"> all of which are modern oriental names of that planet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But against this hypothesis insurmountable objections present themselves. It is universally allowed that the first&nbsp;objects of idolatrous worship were the Sun and Moon, considered as the king and queen of heaven. The fixed stars,&nbsp;indeed, and the planets, were afterwards gradually admitted&nbsp;into the Pagan Pantheon ; but we may be sure that these&nbsp;would be' first associated with the two prime luminaries&nbsp;which most resembled them in brightness, and were supposed to be most benignant to man. The planet Saturn,&nbsp;however, appears to the naked eye with so feeble a lustre,&nbsp;that, in the infancy of astronomy, it could not make such&nbsp;an impression on the mind as to excite that admiration&nbsp;which we must conceive to have always preceded planetary&nbsp;worship. It is to be observed, too, that by the Pagan writers of antiquity Saturn is constantly represented as a star&nbsp;of baleful influence. He is termed the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">leaden planet ;</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">planet of malevolent aspect ;</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dismal,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inhuman star.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">That the Egyptians, at so early a period as that under consideration, should have adored as one of their greatest gods&nbsp;a planet obscure in its appearance, distant in its situation,&nbsp;and baleful in its influence, is wholly incredible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is another star, however, which they might naturally adore, and which we know they actually did worship, as one of their most beneficent gods, at a very early period.&nbsp;This is the citfrgαxu⅛w or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">&lt;supt&gt;i</span><span class="font0"> of the Greeks, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">canis</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stella canicularis</span><span class="font0"> of the Romans, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dog-star</span><span class="font0"> of modern Europe. By the Egyptians it was called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sothis</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Soth,</span><span class="font0"> which signifies safety, beneficence, fecundity ; and it&nbsp;received this name because, making its appearance in the&nbsp;heavens at the very time when the Nile overflowed the&nbsp;country, it was supposed to regulate the inundation. On&nbsp;this account, Plutarch tells us, they believed the soul of&nbsp;their illustrious benefactress Isis to have transmigrated into&nbsp;the star Sothis, w<sup>,</sup>hich they therefore worshipped as the divinity which rendered their country fruitful. It made its&nbsp;appearance, too, on the first day of the month called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thoth, @@<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which was the beginning of the Egyptian year, and as such&nbsp;celebrated with feasting and festivity ; and being by far the&nbsp;brightest star in the heavens, Horus Apollo informs us that it&nbsp;was considered as sovereign over the rest. A combination&nbsp;of so many important circumstances might have induced a&nbsp;people less superstitious than the Egyptians to pay divine&nbsp;homage to that glorious luminary, which was confounded&nbsp;with Isis, who had been long regarded with the highest&nbsp;veneration ; and as Isis was the wife and sister of Osiris, and&nbsp;always associated with him, the star of Isis or Remphan was&nbsp;naturally associated with Moloch, the same with Osiris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But it will be asked, how the star which by the Egyptians was called Soth or Sothis came to be worshipped bv the Hebrews under the appellation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">This is a pertinent question, and we shall endeavour to answer it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Every one knows that the pronunciation of oriental w0rd3 is very uncertain ; and that as the vowels were often omitted in writing, it is of very little importance to the meaning&nbsp;how they be supplied, provided we retain the radical consonants. The word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font0"> may with equal propriety be&nbsp;written </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kiun, Kion,</span><span class="font0"> or even </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kyon,</span><span class="font0"> the HebrewJod being&nbsp;convertible into the Greek </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span class="font0"> or the Roman </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">y ;</span><span class="font0"> but the words&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cane, Chan, Kaη,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Khan,</span><span class="font0"> which are often diversified into </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Khen, Kyn, Cohen, Cahan,</span><span class="font0"> signifying </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">head, chief, prince,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">king,</span><span class="font0"> are diffused throughout a great part of Asia and&nbsp;Europe. In the Chinese language </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quin,</span><span class="font0"> which signifies a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">king,</span><span class="font0"> is so similar to the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Khiun</span><span class="font0"> under consideration, that no etymologist will hesitate to pronounce&nbsp;them of the same origin and import. The W'ord </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kan</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Khan</span><span class="font0"> is universally known to be an honorary title in Tar-tary ; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kaian</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kain,</span><span class="font0"> which is manifestly a cognate&nbsp;of the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chinn</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kiun,</span><span class="font0"> is, in the Pahlavi, or old&nbsp;Persian language, the epithet applied to the dynasty of&nbsp;princes which succeeded Cyrus the Great Amongst the&nbsp;Scythians or ancient Tartars, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ghiun</span><span class="font0"> signifies the Sun and&nbsp;likewise the day ; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kung, Kinung, Kun,</span><span class="font0"> runs through&nbsp;all the dialects of the Gothic tongue, everywhere denoting&nbsp;a chief or sovereign. In the Syrian dialect, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kon</span><span class="font0"> signifies&nbsp;a prince ; and hence the Almighty is styled (Gen. xiv. 19)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Konah,</span><span class="font0"> which is translated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">possessor,</span><span class="font0"> but might, with perhaps more propriety, have been rendered sovereign of heaven and earth. In the Hebrew’, the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kahan</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kahen,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which is the same with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Khan</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kan,</span><span class="font0"> signifies either a&nbsp;priest or a prince ; and in ancient Egypt </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kon</span><span class="font0"> was the&nbsp;name of the first Hercules, or the Sun. Hence the same&nbsp;word in composition denotes greatness, as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Can-obus,</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;great serpent ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Can-athοth,</span><span class="font0"> the great </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thoth</span><span class="font0"> or Mercury ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Can-osiris,</span><span class="font0"> the great </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Osiris.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this deduction we may conclude that the'word, which is found in so many tongues, and always denotes&nbsp;chief, prince, or sovereign, is the very word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chiun</span><span class="font0"> which the&nbsp;Egyptians and Hebrews applied to Sothis, as being, in their&nbsp;conceptions, the chief or sovereign of all the stars. This&nbsp;will appear still more probable, when we have ascertained&nbsp;the import of the w’ord </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Remphan,</span><span class="font0"> or, as the Seventy-two&nbsp;have it, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Raiphan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> This was the case at a very remote period ; but it is otherwise at present, owing to the precession of the Equinoxes.</span></p>
