a celebrated Greek geographer, philoſopher, and hiſtorian, was born at Amasia, and was descended from a family ſettled at Gnoſſus in Crete. He was the diſciple of Xenarchus, a Peripatetic philoſopher, and at length attached himſelf to the Stoics. He contracted a ſtrict friendſhip with Cornelius Gallus, governor of Egypt, and travelled into ſeveral countries to obſerve the situation of places, and the cuſtoms of nations. He flouriſhed under Auguſtus, and died under Tiberius about the year 25, in a very advanced age.— He compoſed ſeveral works, all of which are loſt except his Geography in 17 books; which are juſtly eſteemed very precious remains of antiquity. The two firſt books are employed in ſhowing, that the ſtudy of geography is not only worthy of, but even neceſſary to, a philoſopher ; the third deſcribes Spain; the fourth, Gaul and the Britannic iſles ; the fifth and ſixth, Italy and the adjacent iſles ; the ſeventh, which is imperfect at the end, Germany, the countries of the Getæ and Illyrii, Taurica Cherſonesus, and Epirus; the eighth, ninth, and tenth, Greece with the neighbouring iſles; the four following, Alia within Mount Taurus; the fifteenth and ſixteenth, Aſia without Taurus, India, Perſia, Syria, Arabia; and the seventeenth, Egypt, Æthiopia, Carthage, and other places of Africa. Strabo’s work was publiſhed with a Latin verſion by Xylander, and notes by Iſaac Caſaubon (or rather by Henry Scrimzeer, from whom Caſaubon chiefly ſtole them), at Paris, 1620, in folio. But the beſt edition is that of Amſterdam in 1707, in two volumes folio, by the learned Theodore Janſonius ab Alrnelooveen, with the entire notes of Xylander, Caſaubon, Meurſius, Cluver, Holſtenius, Salmalius, Bochart, Ez. Spanheim, Cellarius, and others. To this edition is ſubjoined the <hi rend="italic">Chrestomathiae,</hi> or epitome of Strabo; which according to Mr Dodwell, who has written a very elaborate and learned diſſertation about it, was made by ſome unknown perſon between the years of Chriſt 676 and 996. It has been found of ſome uſe, not only in helping to correct the original, but in ſupplying in ſome meaſure the defect in the ſeventh book. Mr Dodwell’s dissertation is prefixed to this edition.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
