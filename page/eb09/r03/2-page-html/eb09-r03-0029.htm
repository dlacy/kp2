<p><span class="font1">that thoroughly Roman conception of history which regards actions and events not in relation to their causes or their general human interest but as incidents in the&nbsp;continuous and progressive life of the state. Such is the&nbsp;conception of the past in Livy and Tacitus, and in Ennius&nbsp;and Virgil. But in one respect Cato seems to have formed&nbsp;a truer conception of his subject than any of these writers&nbsp;except Virgil, who, availing himself of the labours of&nbsp;Cato, realized and perfected his conception. Cato felt&nbsp;that the record of Roman glory could not be isolated from&nbsp;the story of the other Italian communities, which, after&nbsp;fighting against Rome for their own independence, shared&nbsp;with it the task of conquering the world. To the wider&nbsp;national sympathies which stimulated the researches of&nbsp;the old censor into the legendary history of the Italian&nbsp;towns we owe some of the most truly national parts of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">JSneid.</span><span class="font1"> There is another point of contact between&nbsp;the work done by Cato and that of Virgil, although they&nbsp;may be regarded as the most dissimilar in intellectual and&nbsp;imaginative gifts in the whole range of Roman literature,&nbsp;the one being the most realistic and prosaic, the other the&nbsp;most idealistic and imaginative. While the ideal charm&nbsp;of the old rural life and industry of Italy still lives in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Georgies,</span><span class="font1"> the practical utilitarian prose of that life may&nbsp;best be learned from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Re Rustica</span><span class="font1"> of Cato.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nsevius, Plautus, Ennius, and Cato not only represent but may be said actually to have been the contending&nbsp;forces which strove for ascendency in determining what&nbsp;was to be the character of the new literature. Although&nbsp;their combined activity was spread over nearly a century,&nbsp;yet so vigorous was their vitality and so prolonged their&nbsp;career that they may be spoken of as contemporaries.&nbsp;Cato, the youngest of the four, was a man of mature years,&nbsp;actively engaged in the service of the state, when Nsevius&nbsp;was still in the full vigour of his powers, and before&nbsp;Plautus had reached the most productive period of his&nbsp;career. It is characteristic of the time that the genius of&nbsp;all these writers was ripest in their old age. They were&nbsp;thus able partially to overcome the difficulties incident to&nbsp;the beginning of their art. They acquired by the rude&nbsp;attempts of their earlier activity the faculty w’hich they&nbsp;exercised with unabated natural force till the end of their&nbsp;lives. In their prolonged career of intellectual energy&nbsp;they remind us of some of the early philosophers and&nbsp;travellers of Greece. The w’ork begun by them w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;carried on by younger contemporaries and successors, that&nbsp;of Plautus by Csecilius Statius and others, the tragedy of&nbsp;Ennius by his kinsman, Pacuvius, and, in the following&nbsp;generation, by Accius. The impulse given to oratory by&nbsp;Cato, Sulpicius Gallus, and others, and along with it the&nbsp;development of prose composition, went on with increased&nbsp;momentum till the age of Cicero. But the interval between&nbsp;the death of Ennius (169) and the beginning of Cicero’s&nbsp;career, ■while one of progressive advance in the appreciation of literary form and style, was much less distinguished&nbsp;by original force than the time immediately before and&nbsp;after the end of the Second Punic War. The one complete&nbsp;survival of the generation after the death of Ennius, the&nbsp;comedy of Terence (185-159), exemplifies the gain in&nbsp;literary accomplishment and the loss in literary freedom.&nbsp;Terence has nothing Roman or Italian except his pure and&nbsp;idiomatic Latinity. His relation to the Greek authors&nbsp;whom he copied is that of a fine engraver to the great&nbsp;painters of another age and time. The Athenian elegance&nbsp;of Terence affords the strongest contrast to the Italian rudeness of Cato’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Re Rustica.</span><span class="font1"> By looking at them together&nbsp;we understand how much the comedy of Terence was able&nbsp;to do to refine and humanize the manners of Rome, but&nbsp;at the same time what a solvent it was of the discipline&nbsp;and ideas of the old republic. What makes Terence an&nbsp;important witness of the culture of his time is that he&nbsp;wrote from the centre of the Scipionic circle, in which&nbsp;what was most humane and liberal in Roman statesmanship was combined with the appreciation of what was&nbsp;most vital in the Greek thought and literature of the time.&nbsp;Cicero tells us that the peculiar glory of that age was the&nbsp;purity of its Latinity; and it is natural to ascribe to the&nbsp;members of that aristocracy of birth and culture the sentiment ascribed to Csesar a century later, that to maintain&nbsp;the purity of the Latin tongue was due to the sense both&nbsp;of personal and of national dignity. The comedies of Terence may therefore be held to give some indication of the&nbsp;tastes of Scipio, Lselius, and their friends in their youth.&nbsp;The influence of Pansetius and Polybius was more adapted&nbsp;to their maturity, when they led the state in war, statesmanship, and oratory, and when the humaner teaching of&nbsp;Stoicism began to enlarge the sympathies of Roman jurists.&nbsp;But in the last years during which this circle kept together&nbsp;a new spirit appeared in Roman politics and a new power&nbsp;in Roman literature,—the revolutionary spirit evoked by&nbsp;the Gracchi in opposition to the long-continued ascendency&nbsp;of the senate, and the new power of Roman satire, which&nbsp;was exercised impartially and unsparingly against both the&nbsp;excesses of the revolutionary spirit and the arrogance and&nbsp;incompetence of the extreme party among the nobles.&nbsp;Roman satire, though in form a legitimate development&nbsp;of the indigenous dramatic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">satura</span><span class="font1"> through the written&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">satura</span><span class="font1"> of Ennius and Pacuvius, is really a birth of this&nbsp;time, and its author was the youngest of those admitted&nbsp;into the intimacy of the Scipionic circle, C. Lucilius of&nbsp;Aurunca (166?@@<sup>1</sup>-102). Among the writers before the age&nbsp;of Cicero he alone deserves to be named with Nsevius,&nbsp;Plautus, Ennius, and Cato as a great originative force in&nbsp;literature. For about thirty years the production of the&nbsp;satires of Lucilius, in which the politics, morals, society,&nbsp;and letters of the time were criticized with the utmost&nbsp;freedom and pungency, and his own personality was brought&nbsp;immediately and familiarly before his contemporaries, was&nbsp;much the most important event in Roman literature. The&nbsp;years that intervened between his death and the beginning&nbsp;of the Ciceronian age are singularly barren in works of&nbsp;original value.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The general results of the last fifty years of the first period, from c. 130 to c. 80, may be thus summed up. In&nbsp;poetry we have the satires of Lucilius, the tragedies of Accius&nbsp;and of a few successors among the Roman aristocracy, who&nbsp;thus exemplified the affinity of the Roman stage to Roman&nbsp;oratory; the “comcedia togata” of Afranius, in which&nbsp;comedy, while assuming a Roman dress, did not assume&nbsp;the virtue of a Roman matron; various annalistic poems&nbsp;intended to serve as continuations of the great poem of&nbsp;Ennius; minor poems of an epigrammatic and erotic character, unimportant anticipations of the Alexandrian tendency operative in the following period; works of criticism&nbsp;in trochaic tetrameters by Porcius Licinus and others,&nbsp;forming part of the critical and grammatical movement&nbsp;which almost from the first accompanied the creative movement in Roman literature, and which may be regarded&nbsp;as rude precursors of the didactic epistles that Horace&nbsp;devoted to literary criticism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The only extant prose work which may be assigned to the end of this period is the treatise on rhetoric known by&nbsp;the title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ad Herennium,</span><span class="font1"> a work indicative of the attention&nbsp;bestowed on prose style and rhetorical studies during the&nbsp;last century of the republic, and which may be regarded&nbsp;as a precursor of the oratorical treatises of Cicero in the&nbsp;following generation and of the work of Quintilian in the&nbsp;first century of the empire. But the great literary pro-</span></p>
