<p><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font0">celebrated Ret er Corneille, that he tranflated it into French, preſented it to the King, and at the fame time&nbsp;paſſed ſo high encomiums on the ſuperior merit of the&nbsp;original, that the author was received into ſhe favour of&nbsp;that monarch, and ever after treated byſhim wiſh Angular reſpect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">De la Rue, anxious to preach the goſpel to the Canadians, requeſted leave of abſence from his ſuperiors ; bμt having deſtined him for the pulpit, they refuſed to&nbsp;comply wiſh his requeſt. Accordingly he commenced&nbsp;preacher, and became one of the moſt eminent orators&nbsp;.of his age. In his diſeourſes he would probably have&nbsp;been too laviſh of his wit, if he had not been cautioned&nbsp;againſt it by a judicious courtier. “ Continue (ſaid he)&nbsp;to preach as you do. We will hear you with pleaſure&nbsp;as long as you reaſon wiſh us ; but avoid wit. We value the wit contained in two verſes of a ſong more than&nbsp;all that is contained in moſt of the fermons in Lent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Relpectιng the delivery of fermons, he entertained </span><span class="font1">an </span><span class="font0">opinion quite oppoſite to the eſtabliſhed practice of&nbsp;his countrymen. In France it was cuſtomary not to&nbsp;read fermons from ſhe pulpit, but to recite them from&nbsp;τnemoιy. TTιis he conſidered as a laborious taſk not&nbsp;compenſated by any advantages. On the contrary, he&nbsp;was of opinion that reading fermons was preferable.—&nbsp;The preacher, wuſh his diſcourſe before him, could&nbsp;read it w<sup>r</sup>ith eaſe, free from that timidity and embar-raſſment which frequently attends the act of recollection ; and he would fave a conſiderable time which is&nbsp;•uſually ſpent in committing it to memory. In theſe&nbsp;ſentiment» many will not be diſpoſed to acquieſce : but,&nbsp;«without pretending to determine the queſtion, it may&nbsp;be aſſerted, that a ſermon, whether read Or recited, if&nbsp;ſpoken in a ſerious manner, and with proper inflections&nbsp;and tones of voice, will produce all ſhe effects, for wſhich&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">ſermon is calculated.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">He w<sup>r</sup>as as amiable in ſociety as he w<sup>,</sup>as venerable in the pulpit. His converſation was pleaſant and inſtruc-tive. His taſte and know ledge enabled him to converſe&nbsp;.with eaſe, and to expreſs himſelf with propriety on every&nbsp;ſubject. He charmed his ſuperiors by his wit, and his&nbsp;inferiors by his affability. Though living ainidſt ſhe&nbsp;buſtle of the world, he was always prepared for the ſo-iitude cf the cloſet and the retreat of the cloiſter. In&nbsp;ſhe pulpit he poured forth the ſineſt effufions of eloquence in the moſt animated and impreſſive manner.—-He publiſhed Panegyrics, Funeral Orations, and Sermons.
