        <p><span class="font1">the one hand and in the provinces on the other. Rome and Italy share
                in the decline of the republic. Political independence and activity die out ; their
                old preeminence and exclusive privileges gradually disappear ;&nbsp;and at the same
                time the weight of the overwhelming&nbsp;power of the princeps, and the abuses of
                their power by&nbsp;individual “ principes,” press most heavily upon them.
                On&nbsp;the other hantl, in the provinces and on the frontiers,&nbsp;where the
                imperial system was most needed, and where&nbsp;from the first it had full play,
                unfettered by the fictions&nbsp;of republican government, it is seen at its best as
                developing or protecting an orderly civilization and maintaining the peace of the
                world.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The decay of the republican institutions had commenced before the
                revolutionary crisis of 49. It was accelerated&nbsp;by the virtual suspension of all
                regular government&nbsp;between 49 and 28 ; and not even the diplomatic deference
                towards ancient forms which Augustus displayed&nbsp;availed to conceal the unreality
                of his work of restoration.&nbsp;The “ comitia ” received back from him “ their
                    ancient&nbsp;rights,”@@<sup>1</sup> and during his lifetime they continued to
                pass&nbsp;laws and to elect magistrates. But after the end of&nbsp;the reign of
                Tiberius we have only two instances&nbsp;of legislation by the assembly in the
                ordinary way,@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>and the law-making of the empire is performed
                either&nbsp;by decrees of the senate or by imperial edicts and&nbsp;constitutions.
                Their prerogative of electing magistrates&nbsp;was, even under Augustus, robbed of
                most of its importance&nbsp;by the control which the princeps exercised over
                their&nbsp;choice by means of his rights of nomination and commendation, rights
                which effectually secured the election&nbsp;of his own nominees.@@<sup>3</sup> By
                Tiberius even this restricted&nbsp;prerogative was still further curtailed. The
                candidates&nbsp;for all magistracies except the consulship were thenceforward
                nominated and voted for in the senate-house and by&nbsp;the senators,@@<sup>4</sup>
                and only the “ renuntiatio,” the formal&nbsp;return of the result, and the
                introduction of the magistrates designate to the people took place in the
                    assembly.@@<sup>5&nbsp;</sup>And, though the election of consuls was never thus
                transferred to the senate, the process of voting seems to have&nbsp;been silently
                abandoned. In the time of the younger&nbsp;Pliny we hear only of the nomination’ of
                the candidates&nbsp;and of their formal “renuntiatio ” in the Campus
                    Martius.@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>By this empty form the ancient right of the people
                to&nbsp;confer all magisterial authority was saved, at least in&nbsp;appearance ;
                and it was acknowledged in as purely formal&nbsp;a manner in the case of the
                princeps himself, who, as&nbsp;long as the principate lasted, continued to receive
                the&nbsp;“ tribunicia potestas ” by a vote of the assembly, and&nbsp;was thus held
                to derive his authority from the people.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">This almost complete effacement of the “ comitia ” was largely due to
                the fact that they had ceased to represent&nbsp;anything but the populace of Rome,
                and the comparatively greater vitality shown by the old magistracies is&nbsp;mainly
                attributable to the value they continued to possess in&nbsp;the eyes of the Roman
                upper class. But, though they were</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">eagerly sought,@@<sup>8</sup> and conferred on their holders
                considerable social distinction, the magistrates ceased, except in name,&nbsp;to be
                the popularly chosen executive officers of the Roman&nbsp;state. In the
                administration of the empire at large they&nbsp;had no share, if we except the
                subordinate duties still&nbsp;assigned to the quæstor in a province. In Rome,
                to&nbsp;which their sphere of work was limited, they were overshadowed by the
                dominant authority of the princeps,&nbsp;while their range of duties was
                increasingly circumscribed&nbsp;by the gradual transference of administrative
                authority,&nbsp;even within the city, to the emperor and his
                subordinate&nbsp;officials. And their dependence on the princeps was confirmed by
                the control he exercised over their appointment&nbsp;For all candidates the
                approval, if not the commendation,&nbsp;of the princeps became the indispensable
                condition of&nbsp;success, and the princeps on his side treated these
                ancient&nbsp;offices as pieces of preferment with which to reward his&nbsp;adherents
                or gratify the ambition of Roman nobles. In&nbsp;all instances, too, the dignity of
                the office was impaired&nbsp;by the practice, begun by Cæsar and continued
                by&nbsp;Augustus and his successors, of granting the insignia to&nbsp;men who had
                not held the actual magistracy itself.@@<sup>9</sup> The&nbsp;change is especially
                noticeable in the case of the consuls,&nbsp;the chief magistrates of the old
                commonwealth. The consulship was still the highest post open to the
                    private&nbsp;citizen,@@<sup>10</sup> and consular rank a necessary qualification
                for&nbsp;high office in the provinces ;@@<sup>11</sup> but the actual consuls
                have&nbsp;scarcely any other duties than those of presiding in the&nbsp;senate,
                conducting its proceedings, and occasionally executing its decrees,@@<sup>12</sup>
                while their term of office dwindles from&nbsp;a year to six and finally to two
                    months.@@<sup>13</sup> In the age of&nbsp;Tacitus and the younger Pliny, the
                contrast is striking&nbsp;enough between the high estimate set on the dignity
                of&nbsp;the office and the frankness with which both its limited&nbsp;powers and its
                dependence on the emperor are acknowledged.@@<sup>14</sup> Of the other magistrates
                the prætors continued&nbsp;to exercise their old jurisdiction with little formal
                change&nbsp;down at least to the latter half of the second century,&nbsp;but only as
                subordinate to the higher judicial authority&nbsp;of the emperor.@@<sup>15</sup> The
                ædiles seem to have retained only&nbsp;such petty police duties as did not pass to
                one or another&nbsp;of the numerous imperial prefects and
                    commissioners.@@<sup>16&nbsp;</sup>The tribunate fared still worse, for, by the
                side of the&nbsp;tribunicia potestas wielded by the princeps, it sank
                into&nbsp;insignificance, and it is described by the younger Pliny&nbsp;as a “
                shadow and an empty name.”@@<sup>17</sup> The quæstorship</span></p>
