Hence, as there is a greater ſimilarity between this animal and man, than between thoſe creatures which reſemble him moſt, as the Barbary ape, the baboon, and monkey, who have all been deſigned by the general name of <hi rend="italic">apes, </hi>the Indians are to be excuſed for associating him with the human ſpecies, under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">orang-outang,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wild man.</hi> In fine, if there were a ſcale by which we could deſcend from human nature to that of the brutes, and if the eſſence of this nature conſiſted entirely in the form of the body, and depended on its organization, the orang-outang would approach nearer to man than any other animal. Placed in the ſecond rank oſ beings, he would make the other animals feel his ſuperiority, and oblige them to obey him. If the principle of imitation, by which he ſeems to mimic human actions, were a result of thought, this ape would be ſtill farther removed from the brutes, and have a greater affinity to man. But the interval which ſeparates them is immenſe. Mind, reflection, and language, depend not on figure or the organization of the body. Theſe are endowments peculiar to man. The orangoutang, though, as we have ſeen, he has a body, members, ſenſes, a brain, and a tongue, perfectly ſimilar to thoſe of man, neither ſpeaks nor thinks. Though he counterfeits every human movement, he performs no action that is characteriſtic of man, no action that has the ſame principle or the ſame deſign. With regard to imitation, which appears to be the moſt ſtriking character of the ape kind, and which the vulgar have attributed to him as a peculiar talent, before we decide, it is neceſſary to inquire whether this imitation be ſpontaneous or forced. Does the ape imitate us from inclination, or becauſe, without any exertion of the will, he feels the capacity of doing it ? I appeal to ail thoſe who have examined this animal without prejudice ; and I am convinced that they will agree with me, that there is nothing voluntary in this imitation. The ape, having arms and hands, uſes them as we do, but without thinking of us. The ſimilarity of his members and organs neceſſarily produces movements, and ſometimes ſucceſſions of movements, which reſemble ours. Being endowed with the human ſtructure, the ape muſt move like man ; but the ſame motions imply not that he acts from imitation. Two bodies which receive the ſame impulſe, two ſimilar pendulums or machines, will move in the ſame manner ; but theſe bodies or machines can never be ſaid to imitate each other in their motions.</p><p>The ape and the human body are two machines ſimilarly conſtructed, and neceſſarily move nearly in the same manner ; but parity is not imitation. The one depends on matter, and the other on mind. Imitation preſuppoſes the deſign of imitating. The ape is incapable of forming this deſign, which requires a train of thinking ; conſequently man, if he inclines, can imitate the ape ; but the ape cannot even incline to imitate man.”</p><p>3.	Pongo, or Jocko, are conſidered as one ſpecies by Pennant and Gmelin. It inhabits the iſland of Java, and the interior parts of Guinea. Has no pouches within his cheeks, no tail, and no calloſities on the buttocks ; which laſt are plump and fleſhy. All the teeth are ſimilar to thoſe of man. The face is flat, naked, and tawny ; the ears, hands, feet, breaſt, and belly, are</p><p>likewiſe naked ; the hair of the head descends on both temples in the form of treſſes ; the hair on the back and loins is in ſmall quantities. It is five or six feet high, and walks always erect on the two hind feet. It has not been aſcertained whether the females, of this ſpecies or variety, are ſubject to periodical diſcharges; but analogy renders this almoſt unqueſtionable. This animal is, by Dr Gmelin, considered only as a variety of the orang-outang.</p><p>4.	The great gibbon, long-armed ape, or ſimia lar, with a flat ſwarthy face ſurrounded with grey hairs : hair on the body black and rough ; buttocks bare ; nails on the hands flat ; on the feet long ; arms of a moſt disproportioned length, reaching quite to the ground when the animal is erect, its natural poſture ; of a hideous deformity.— Inhabits India, Malacca, and the Molucca iſles ; a mild and gentle animal ; grows to the height of four feet. The great black ape of Mangſi, a province in China, ſeems to be of this kind.</p><p>5.	The leſſer gibbon, or ſimia lar minor, but is much leſs, being only about a foot and a half high ; the body and face are of a brown colour, reſembles the former. The ſimia lar argentea is probably a variety of this ſpecies.</p><p>6.	The pigmy, or ſimia ſilvanus, has no tail ; the buttocks are naked ; the head roundiſh, and the arms ſhorter than the body. It inhabits Africa ; and is not uncommon in our exhibitions of animals ; is very tractable and good-natured, and was moſt probably the pigmy of the ancients. It abounds in Æthiopia, one feat of that imaginary nation ; was believed to dwell near the fountains of the Nile, whence it descended annually to make war on the cranes, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> to ſteal their eggs, which the birds may be suppoſed naturally to defend ; whence the fiction of their combats.</p><p>7.	The magot, ſimia inuus, or Barbary ape, has a long face, not unlike that of a dog ; canine teeth, long and ſtrong; cars like the human ; nails flat; buttocks bare; colour of the upper part of the body a dirty greeniſh brown ; belly, of a dull pale yellow ; grows to above the length of four feet.—They inhabit many parts of India, Arabia, and all parts of Africa except Egypt, where none oſ this genus are found. A few are found on the hill of Gibraltar, which breed there ; probably from a pair that had eſcaped from the town ; as they are not found in any other part of Spain.—They are very ill-natured, miſchievous, and fierce ; agreeing with the character of the ancient Cynocephali. They are a very common kind in exhibitions. By force of diſcipline they are made to play ſome tricks ; otherwiſe they are more dull and ſullen than the rest of this genus. They aſſemble in great troops in the open fields in India, and will attack women going to market, and take their proviſions from them. The females carry the young in their aims, and will leap from tree to tree with them. Apes were worſhipped in India, and had magnificent temples erected to them. When the Portugueſe plundered one in Ceylon, they found in a little golden caſket the tooth of an ape ; a relic held by the natives in ſuch veneration, that they offered 700,000 ducats to redeem it, but in vain ; for it was burnt by the viceroy, to ſtop the progreſs of idolatry.</p><p>II.	<hi rend="smallcaps">Papiones,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Baboons.</hi> Theſe have ſhort tails, a long face ; a broad high muzzle; longiſh dog-like tuſks, or canine teeth ; and naked calloſities on the buttocks. They are only found in the old world, and are the papiones and Κυνοχεϙαλα of the ancients.</p><p>8.	The maimon, ſimia papio nemeſtrina, or pig-tailed</p></body></text></TEI>
