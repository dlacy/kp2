<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Beyond the ordinary claims of art, it commands our attention from the grand conception of the painter who here as in other pictures and etchings has invested Christ with a&nbsp;majestic dignity which recalls Leonardo and no other. A&nbsp;similar lofty ideal is to be found in his various renderings&nbsp;of the Pilgrims at Emmaus, notably in the Louvre picture&nbsp;of 1648, in which, as Mrs Jameson says, “he returns to&nbsp;those first spiritual principles which were always the dowry&nbsp;of ancient art. Here we have before us a countenance pale&nbsp;and tender, meek and lowly of heart, adorned only with&nbsp;holiness and a glorified life.” From the same year we&nbsp;have the Good Samaritan of the Louvre, the story being&nbsp;told with intense pathos. The helpless suffering of the&nbsp;wounded man, the curiosity of the boy on tiptoe, the&nbsp;excited faces at the upper window, are all conveyed with&nbsp;masterly skill. In these two last pictures we find a&nbsp;broader touch and freer handling, while the tones pass&nbsp;into a dull yellow and brown with a marked predilection&nbsp;for deep rich red. Whether it was that this scheme of&nbsp;colour found no favour with the Amsterdamers, who, as&nbsp;Hoogstraten tells us, could not understand the Sortie, it&nbsp;seems certain that Rembrandt was not invited to take&nbsp;any leading part in the celebration of the congress of&nbsp;Westphalia of this year (1648), a year famous in Dutch&nbsp;history for the European declaration of the independence&nbsp;of Holland, and in Dutch art as the subject of Terburg’s&nbsp;picture in the National Gallery and of Van der Heist’s&nbsp;famous Banquet of the Civic Guard at Amsterdam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Rembrandt touched no side of art without setting his mark on it, whether in still life, as in his dead birds or&nbsp;the Slaughtered Ox of the Louvre, or in his drawings of&nbsp;elephants and lions, all of which are instinct with life.&nbsp;But at this period of his career we come upon a branch of&nbsp;his art on which he left, both in etching and in painting,&nbsp;the stamp of his genius, viz., landscape. Roeland Roghman,&nbsp;but ten years his senior, evidently influenced his style, for&nbsp;the resemblance between their works is so great that, as at&nbsp;Cassel, there has been confusion of authorship. Hercules&nbsp;Seghers also was much appreciated by Rembrandt, for at&nbsp;his sale eight pictures by this master figure in the inventory, and Vosmaer discovered that Rembrandt had worked&nbsp;on a plate by Seghers and had added figures to an etched&nbsp;Flight into Egypt. The earliest pure landscape known to&nbsp;us from Rembrandt’s hand is the Winter Scene of Cassel&nbsp;(1646), silvery and delicate. As a rule in his painted&nbsp;landscape he aims at grandeur and poetical effect, as in the&nbsp;Repose of the Holy Family of 1647 (till recently called the&nbsp;Gipsies), a moonlight effect, clear even in the shadows. The&nbsp;Canal of Lord Lansdowne, and the Mountain Landscape&nbsp;with the Approaching Storm, the sun shining out behind&nbsp;the heavy clouds, are both conceived and executed in this&nbsp;spirit. A similar poetical vein runs through the Castle&nbsp;on the Hill of Cassel, in which the beams of the setting&nbsp;sun strike on the castle while the valley is sunk in the&nbsp;shades of approaching night. More powerful still is the&nbsp;weird effect of Lord Lansdowne’s Windmill, with its glow&nbsp;of light and darkening shadows. In all these pictures&nbsp;light with its magical influences is the theme of the poet-painter. From the number of landscapes by himself in&nbsp;the inventory of his sale, it would appear that these grand&nbsp;works were not appreciated by his contemporaries. The&nbsp;last of the landscape series dates from 1655 or 1656, the&nbsp;close of the middle age or manhood of Rembrandt, a period&nbsp;of splendid power. In the Joseph Accused by Potiphar’s&nbsp;Wife of 1654 we have great dramatic vigour and perfect&nbsp;mastery of expression, while the brilliant colour and&nbsp;glowing effect of light and shade attest his strength. To&nbsp;this period also belongs the great portrait of himself in&nbsp;the Fitzwilliam Museum at Cambridge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">But evil days were at hand. The long-continued wars</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and civil troubles had worn out the country. Trade and commerce languished, and in Amsterdam hundreds of&nbsp;houses were empty. Rembrandt’s brothers had suffered,&nbsp;and money was scarce. His own and doubtless Saskia’s&nbsp;means were tied up in his house and in his large collection&nbsp;of valuable pictures, and we find Rembrandt borrowing considerable sums of money on the security of his house to&nbsp;keep things going. Perhaps, as Bode suggests, this was the&nbsp;reason of his extraordinary activity at this time. Then,&nbsp;unfortunately, in this year of 1654, we find Rembrandt&nbsp;involved in the scandal of having a child by his servant&nbsp;Hendrickie Jaghers or Stoffels, as appears by the books of&nbsp;the Reformed Church at Amsterdam. He recognized the&nbsp;child and gave it the name of Cornelia after his muchloved mother, but there is no proof that he married the&nbsp;mother, and the probability is against such a marriage, as&nbsp;the provisions of Saskia’s will would in that case have come&nbsp;into force, and her fortune would have passed at once to&nbsp;her son Titus. Hendrickie seems to have continued to&nbsp;live with him, for we find her claiming a chest as her&nbsp;property at his sale in 1658. Doubtless she is the peasant&nbsp;girl of Rasdorf to whom Houbraken says Rembrandt was&nbsp;married. Sad as the story is, Hendrickie has an interest&nbsp;for us. Bode asserts that in his art there was always a&nbsp;woman in close relationship to Rembrandt and appearing&nbsp;in his work—his mother, his sister, and then Saskia. Are&nbsp;there any traces of Hendrickie ? What if the little servant&nbsp;maid of ten years, painted about 1645 (Dulwich Gallery),&nbsp;and again in the Demidoff picture of the same year, in&nbsp;which the girl is painted in the red dress of a Dutch&nbsp;orphan, in both cases smiling and leaning over a window,&nbsp;were the maidservant of his house in 1654? The ages&nbsp;would correspond. Bode suggests that the beautiful portrait of the Lady in the Salon Carré of the Louvre and&nbsp;the Amor and Cupid of the same gallery may represent&nbsp;Hendrickie and her child. Both pictures belong to this&nbsp;date, and by their treatment are removed from the category&nbsp;of Rembrandt’s usual portraits. But if this is conjecture,&nbsp;we get nearer to fact when we look at the picture exhibited&nbsp;at Burlington House in 1883 to which tradition has&nbsp;attached the name of “ Rembrandt’s Mistress.” At a&nbsp;glance one can see that it is not the mere head of a&nbsp;model, as she lies in bed raising herself to put aside a&nbsp;curtain as if she heard a well-known footstep. It is&nbsp;clearly a woman in whom Rembrandt had a personal&nbsp;interest. The date is clearly 165 , the fourth figure being&nbsp;illegible; but the brilliant carnations and masterly touch&nbsp;connect it with the Potiphar’s Wife of 1654 and the&nbsp;Jaghers period. It is painful to turn from this attempt&nbsp;to trace the life of Rembrandt in his work to the sadder&nbsp;side of the story. In 1656 his financial affairs became&nbsp;more involved, and the Orphans’ Chamber transferred the&nbsp;house and ground to Titus, though Rembrandt was still&nbsp;allowed to take charge of Saskia’s estate. Nothing, however, could avert the ruin of the painter, who was declared&nbsp;bankrupt in July 1656, an inventory of all his property&nbsp;being ordered by the Insolvency Chamber. The first sale&nbsp;took place in 1657 in the Keizerskroon hotel, Thomas&nbsp;Jacobz Haring, a well-known name in connexion with&nbsp;Rembrandt’s art, being auctioneer; and the second, at&nbsp;which the larger part of the etchings and drawings were&nbsp;disposed of, in 1658—“collected by Rembrandt himself&nbsp;with much love and care,” says the catalogue. The sum&nbsp;realized, under 5000 guilders, was but a fraction of their&nbsp;value. The time was unfavourable over the whole of&nbsp;Europe for such sales, the renowned collection of Charles&nbsp;I. of England having brought but a comparatively small&nbsp;sum in 1653. Driven thus from his house, stripped of&nbsp;everything he possessed even to his table linen, Rembrandt&nbsp;took a modest lodging in the same Keizerskroon hostelry</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
