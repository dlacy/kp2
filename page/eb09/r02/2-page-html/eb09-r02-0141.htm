<p><span class="font0">the channel across the samly beach into deep water (fig. 13)'. The cat, three miles long, was only partially excavated, its completion&nbsp;being effected by damming up the old channel and directing&nbsp;the fresh-water discharge and tidal current through the new cut.&nbsp;The scour soon deepened the narrow cut ; but some of the sand&nbsp;washed from the cut settled in the wider channel formed by the&nbsp;jetties. The cut also, being scoured deeper than the adjacent channel&nbsp;above and below, was not adequately widened, and consequently&nbsp;impedes the entry of the flood tide up the river (figs. 13 and&nbsp;11). The desired depth of 23 feet at high water not having&nbsp;been attained as anticipated from the works, dredging has been&nbsp;resorted to for deepening the outlet ; and the widening out of the&nbsp;cut to the proper full width would improve the tidal influx. The&nbsp;jetties consist of fascine mattresses secured by piles and stakes and&nbsp;weighted with stone ( fig. 15) ; and their outer portions have been&nbsp;kept down to half-tide level to promote the freer admission of the&nbsp;flood tide, whilst serving equally to concentrate the latter part of&nbsp;the ebb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Charleston Jetties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The largest jetty works in the world for lowering a bar in front of a tidal estuary are being constructed at the entrance to Charleston harbour (fig. 17). The jetties are being formed after the&nbsp;type of the Maas jetties, with log and fascine mattresses weighted&nbsp;with rubble stone (fig. 18). They start from the shore about&nbsp;2j miles apart and converge to a width of about 2000 feet over&nbsp;the bar, which stretches across the entrance to the harbour at If&nbsp;miles from the shore. The object of the works is to concentrate the&nbsp;tidal and fresh-water current from the land-locked estuary, having&nbsp;an area of 15 square miles, into which the Ashley and Cooper&nbsp;rivers flow, and whose mouth forms the entrance to Charleston&nbsp;harbour. The northern jetty, which was commenced in 1878,&nbsp;attained the present length of 14,860 feet in 1881 ; and the&nbsp;southern jetty had been carried out 14,130 feet towards the end of&nbsp;1883. The outer portions, lying in the direction of the flood current, are to be raised ; but the inner portions are to be kept low, in&nbsp;order to interfere as little as possible with the littoral drift and&nbsp;thus avoid an advance of the foreshore, and also in order to admit&nbsp;freely the flood tide. Though scour has already commenced, it will&nbsp;be necessary to aid it by dredging in order to attain a depth of 21&nbsp;feet in place of the former depth of 11⅜ feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Improvement of Tideless Rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tideless rivers on entering the sea have their velocity checked, and consequently deposit the silt which they&nbsp;previously carried in suspension. In process of time this&nbsp;accumulated deposit forms a tract of low-lying land&nbsp;protruding into the sea, through which the river flows in&nbsp;several shallow channels to the sea owing to the impediments offered to its flow by the sediment which it deposits.&nbsp;The form which these diverging channels assume has led&nbsp;to the term delta being applied to the mouths of tideless&nbsp;rivers and the tract of land which they create (figs. 19&nbsp;and 22). These deltas are always advancing, and consequently reducing the very small fall of the channels&nbsp;through them by prolonging their course. The rate of&nbsp;advance varies with the amount of sediment brought down,&nbsp;the depth of the sea in front, and the extent to which the&nbsp;delta spreads out. The Rhone delta has at present a&nbsp;yearly average progression of 140 feet; the Kilia mouths&nbsp;of the Danube delta have been estimated to advance 200&nbsp;feet annually ; whilst the Mississippi delta, extending 220&nbsp;miles into the Gulf of Mexico, is supposed to have taken&nbsp;four thousand four hundred years in forming, which would&nbsp;be equivalent to an average annual advance of 264 feet,&nbsp;the present advance being about 207 feet in a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The only method of improving the outlet of a tideless river is to concentrate the current flowing through one of&nbsp;the channels, and to prolong the banks of the regulated&nbsp;channel into deep water by means of parallel jetties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The only other way of remedying the impediments to navigation at the mouths of tideless rivers is by avoiding&nbsp;the delta channels altogether, and constructing a canal&nbsp;connecting the deep river above the delta with the sea at&nbsp;some suitable place beyond the influence of the river&nbsp;alluvium. This expedient has been resorted to for the&nbsp;trade of the Rhone ; for, though the discharge of the river&nbsp;was concentrated into a single outlet by forming embankments on each side, between 1852 and 1857, which shut&nbsp;off the other three outlets and extended into the sea at&nbsp;its mouth, the increased discharge brought down the whole&nbsp;sediment of the river, and a bar formed again farther out.&nbsp;Accordingly the St Louis Canal was formed, between 1863&nbsp;and 1873, going from the head of the delta into the Bay&nbsp;of Foz beyond the limits of the delta. A similar plan was&nbsp;proposed for the Mississippi, but was abandoned in favour&nbsp;of the jetty system. The canal constructed by the emperor&nbsp;Claudius for connecting the Tiber with the harbour of&nbsp;Ostia proved a failure, as its outlet at Ostia was not&nbsp;sufficiently removed from the delta, so that it gradually&nbsp;silted up and is now 2 miles from the coast.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The success of the jetty system depends upon the existence of a littoral current to carry away the sediment in the stream conveyed by aid of the jetties into deep water, or&nbsp;upon the gradual prolongation of the jetties to keep pace&nbsp;with the progression of the delta. The outlets of the&nbsp;Danube and the Mississippi have both been improved by&nbsp;training one of their minor delta channels into deep water ;&nbsp;and hitherto the depth over the bars has been maintained.&nbsp;In the case of the Danube, the southerly current sweeping&nbsp;across the outlet carries away a portion of the issuing&nbsp;sediment. The Mississippi jetties direct the discharge into&nbsp;such deep water, and with so much velocity, that it may&nbsp;be premature to decide to what extent the maintenance of&nbsp;the depth may be due to a westerly current in the gulf ;&nbsp;but hitherto from one cause or the other, or probably from&nbsp;both combined, the bar has not formed again in front of&nbsp;the jetties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sulina Piers of the Danube Delta.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The delta of the Danube commences about 45 miles from the Black Sea, and has an area of 1000 square miles. The river divides&nbsp;into three main branches; the northern or Kilia branch conveys more&nbsp;than three-fifths of the discharge, but it forms an independent delta&nbsp;near its outlet and is consequently unsuitable for improvement (fig.&nbsp;19). The southern or St George branch is the next largest, and&nbsp;possesses the best channel, but it divides near its outlet into two&nbsp;channels, which are both barred. The central or Sulina branch,&nbsp;though narrower and less good than the St George branch, and&nbsp;conveying less than one-thirteenth of the total discharge, possessed&nbsp;the only navigable outlet in 1858, and was therefore selected for&nbsp;the provisional improvement works begun in that year. The works&nbsp;designed by Sir Charles Hartley consist of piers, starting on each&nbsp;side of the Sulina outlet, which converge till the width between&nbsp;them is 600 feet, and are then carried parallel across the bar&nbsp;(fig. 20). The piers were at first constructed of rubble mounds&nbsp;with piles carrying a platform strengthened at intervals by timber&nbsp;cribs ; but subsequently they were consolidated with concrete&nbsp;blocks (fig. 21). These piers serve to concentrate the discharge&nbsp;across the bar, and increased the least depth at the outlet from 9&nbsp;feet in 1857 to 20 feet in 1872, a year after the final completion&nbsp;of the works ; and this depth has been since maintained. The&nbsp;sediment-bearing current, moreover, is carried within the influence&nbsp;of the southern littoral current, which, diverting a portion of the&nbsp;deposit, has reduced the rate of advance of the Sulina delta from&nbsp;94 feet to 44 feet in a year. This progression, however, will eventually necessitate the extension of the piers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Mississippi Jetties.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though the Gulf of Mexico is in communication with the Atlantic Ocean, it is almost tideless, for the average rise of tide in&nbsp;front of the Mississippi delta is only 14 inches, and there is only&nbsp;one tide in a day. The Mississippi, accordingly, is a tideless river,&nbsp;and forms a delta which has an area of 12,300 square miles, and&nbsp;has three main channels, or passes, leading the discharge of the&nbsp;river into the gulf (fig. 22). The general features of the delta&nbsp;have been already described, and the various schemes for improving&nbsp;the outlet referred to (see Mississippi). In flood time the river&nbsp;brings down in suspension 2800 cubic feet of solid matter per&nbsp;second ; and before the jetties were commenced the annual advance&nbsp;of the bars at the mouths of the passes was 300 feet at the South-West Pass, 260 feet at Pass à ΓOutre, and 110 feet at the South&nbsp;Pass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1874 Mr Eads offered to make and maintain a channel 28 feet deep across the bar of the South-West Pass, which had only 13 feet&nbsp;of water over it. The South Pass is narrower, having a width of&nbsp;from 600 to 800 feet ; it conveys only about a tenth of the total discharge of the river ; it was impeded by a shoal at the head of the&nbsp;pass with a depth of only 15 feet over it ; and the depth on the bar&nbsp;at its mouth, where it expanded to 2 miles in width, was only 8</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
