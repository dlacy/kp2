 in antiquity, a ſtratagem or device of the Lacedemonians, for the ſecret writing of letters to their correſpondents, ſo that if they ſhould chance to be intercepted, nobody might be able to read them.—To this end they had two wooden rollers or cylinders, perfectly alike and equal; one whereof was kept in the city, the other by the perſon to whom the letter was directed. For the letter, a ſkin of very thin parchment was wrapped round the roller, and thereon was the matter written; which done, it was taken off, and ſent away to the party, who, upon putting it in the ſame manner upon his roller, found the lines and words in the very ſame diſpoſition as when they were firſt written. This expedient they ſet a very high value on; though, in truth, artleſs and groſs enough: the moderns have improved vaſtly on this method of writing.
