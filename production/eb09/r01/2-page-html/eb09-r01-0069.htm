<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAIS, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Raiz, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Retz, Gilles de </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(d. 1410), marshal of France, seigneur of Hautpart and of many other lordships,&nbsp;who was hanged and burned at Nantes in 1440, has left&nbsp;a name connected directly with one of the most horrible&nbsp;stories in history, and indirectly with other curious matter.&nbsp;Not much is known of Rais before the trial which made&nbsp;his name infamous. He was of the noblest blood of the&nbsp;marches of Brittany, being on the father’s side of the&nbsp;Laval branch of the ducal family of Montfort, and being&nbsp;connected through his mother and by marriage with the&nbsp;houses of Craon, Thouars, and others. His possessions in&nbsp;the district from which he took his name, and which&nbsp;borders the estuary of the Loire on the south, as well as&nbsp;along the river, were great, and his chief seat was at&nbsp;ChamptocA He had served in the English wars with&nbsp;the credit of a brave knight, had a rather special reputation for devotion, had been marshal since 1429, and had&nbsp;held the alms-dish at the coronation of Charles VII.&nbsp;Suddenly he was arrested, tried, and, as above stated,&nbsp;executed on the evidence of accomplices and his own confession. The crimes with which he was charged extended&nbsp;over some fourteen years. During that period it was&nbsp;alleged that he had, through different agents, especially&nbsp;a AA'oman called La Meffraie, kidnapped or enticed to&nbsp;his various abodes large numbers (Monstrelet says 100,&nbsp;others 140) of children. These children, after being subjected to every outrage of lust and cruelty, Avere sacrificed&nbsp;to the devil, their blood used for magical ceremonies,&nbsp;their bodies burned, and their bones buried in the precincts&nbsp;of Rais’s castles. The ultimate purpose of this deAnl-worship Avas asserted to be the acquisition by Rais (who&nbsp;was assisted by divers sorcerers, especially an Italian imported for the purpose) of power and honours in the state.&nbsp;The depositions were A<sup>r</sup>ery full and still exist, and on them&nbsp;and his confession Rais Avas executed. It is, however,&nbsp;somewhat suspicious that the bishop of Nantes, who promoted, and the duke of Brittany, who sanctioned the proceedings, were both bitter personal enemies of Rais, Ailiile&nbsp;the king, who AA־as also concerned, had for a main part of&nbsp;his policy the putting doAvn of feudal barons </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ayIio, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">like&nbsp;Rais, held posts of vantage in the country. The tAA<sup>T</sup>o chief&nbsp;contemporary authors </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">avIio </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">mention the case, Monstrelet&nbsp;and Chastellain, speak of it Avith somewhat less horror&nbsp;than might, even alloAving for possible political sympathies,&nbsp;have been expected. Monstrelet (who says that Rais was&nbsp;charged Avith the murder of pregnant Avomen also) says&nbsp;that “ many ladies and damsels ” begged his body of the&nbsp;duke, and that great part of the nobles of Brittany, not&nbsp;only his relations, had great sorroAv and sadness for his&nbsp;death. Chastellain introduces the ghost of Rais in rather&nbsp;striking fashion in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Temple de Bocace</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> as “ folloAved by&nbsp;a multitude of little children crying ‘Vengeance.’” The&nbsp;affair affected public imagination as much because of&nbsp;the rarity of a criminal of such rank being brought to&nbsp;justice as of the heinousness of the crimes attributed&nbsp;to him. Locally it took a very strong hold of the popular mind, and a tradition not easy to trace connects&nbsp;it with the Bluebeard legend, which finally took shape&nbsp;in the hands of Perrault. This connexion, liOAvever,&nbsp;hardly bears examination. In the first place, there is&nbsp;no evidence that Rais ever was called Bluebeard, though&nbsp;a contemporary English adventurer A\'ho is mentioned&nbsp;by Holinshed </span><span class="font1">Avas </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">so called, and may have left a bad&nbsp;reputation in France. In the second, it is impossible to&nbsp;trace even the most superficial resemblance betAveen the&nbsp;stories. In </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Bluebeard</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> there are no children concerned,&nbsp;no unnatural crimes, no sorcery; it is merely one of&nbsp;the numerous stories of “ punished curiosity ” so frequent in folk-lore. As it stands the Rais story is too&nbsp;horrible to make much of a figure in literature; but it&nbsp;has attracted some students of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">causes célèbres,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> notably&nbsp;Dumas </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fils</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Tristan le Roux.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">For authorities besides the passages of Monstrelet and Chastellain above quoted, Michelet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Histoire de France,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Vallet de Viriville,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Histoire de Charles VIL,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> may be consulted. Mézeray’s account,&nbsp;usually followed in books of reference, is loose ; he had evidently&nbsp;not seen the records, nor even Monstrelet. But his assignment of&nbsp;a state crime against the duke as the real cause of death is very&nbsp;probable, though not formally correct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAISINS are the dried fruits of certain varieties of the grape vine, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vit is vinifera,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which groAv principally in the&nbsp;warm climate of the Mediterranean coasts and are comparatively rich in sugar. The use of dried grapes or raisins&nbsp;as food is of great antiquity (Numb. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">1 ; 3 .¡־ Sam. xxv.&nbsp;18, xxx. 12). In mediaeval times raisins imported from&nbsp;Spain Avere a prized luxury in England, and to the present day Great Britain continues to be the best customer&nbsp;of the raisin-producing regions. “ Raisins of the sun ” are&nbsp;obtained by letting the fruit continue on the vines after&nbsp;it has come to maturity, Avhere there is sufficient sunshine&nbsp;and heat in the autumn, till the clusters dry on the stocks.&nbsp;Another plan is partially to sever the stalk before the&nbsp;grapes are quite ripe, thus stopping the </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Aoav </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">of the sap,&nbsp;and in that condition to leave them on the vines till they&nbsp;are .sufficiently dry. The more usual process, liOAvever,&nbsp;is to cut off the fully ripe clusters and expose them,&nbsp;spread out, for several days to the rays of the sun, taking&nbsp;care that they are not injured by rain. In unfavourable&nbsp;weather they may be dried in a heated chamber, but&nbsp;are then inferior in quality. In some parts of Spain and&nbsp;France it is common to dip the gathered clusters in boiling&nbsp;Avater, or in a strong potash lye, a practice which softens&nbsp;the skin, favours drying, and gives the raisins a clear&nbsp;glossy appearance. Again, in Asia Minor the fruit is&nbsp;dipped into hot Avater on the surface of which swims a&nbsp;layer of olive oil, which communicates a bright lustre and&nbsp;softness to the skin. Some superior A־arieties are treated&nbsp;with very great care, retained on their stalks, and sent&nbsp;into the market as clusters for table use ; but the greater&nbsp;part are separated from the stalks in the process of drying&nbsp;and the stalks AvinnoAved out of the fruit. Raisins come&nbsp;from numerous Mediterranean localities, and present at&nbsp;least three distinct varieties,—(1) ordinary or large raisins,&nbsp;(2) sultana seedless raisins, and (3) currants or Corinthian&nbsp;raisins (see vol. vi. </span><span class="font0">p. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">715). The greater proportion of&nbsp;the common large raisins of English commerce comes from&nbsp;the provinces of Malaga, Valencia, and Alicante in Spain ;&nbsp;these are knoAvn by the common name of Malaga raisins.&nbsp;Those of the finest quality, called Malaga clusters, are&nbsp;prepared from a variety of muscatel grape, and preserved&nbsp;on the stalks for table use. This variety, as Avell as&nbsp;Malaga layers, so called from the manner of packing, are&nbsp;exclusively used as dessert fruit. Raisins of a somewhat&nbsp;inferior quality, knoAvn as “lexias,” from the same provinces, are used for cooking and baking purposes. Smyrna&nbsp;raisins also come to some extent into the English market.&nbsp;The best quality, knoAvn as Elemé, is a large fruit, having&nbsp;a reddish yelloAv skin with a sweet pleasant flavour.&nbsp;Large-seeded dark-coloured raisins are produced in some&nbsp;of the islands of the Greek Archipelago and in Crete, but&nbsp;they are little seen in the British markets. In Italy the&nbsp;finest raisins are produced in Calabria, inferior qualities&nbsp;in central Italy and in Sicily. From the Lipari Islands&nbsp;a certain quantity of cluster raisins of good quality is&nbsp;sent to England. In the south of France raisins of high&nbsp;excellence—Provence raisins in clusters—are obtained&nbsp;at RoqueA<sup>r</sup>aire, Lunel, and Frontignan. Sultana seedless&nbsp;raisins are the produce of a small variety of yellow grape,&nbsp;cultivated exclusively in the neighbourhood of Smyrna.&nbsp;The vines are groAvn on a soil of decomposed hippurite&nbsp;limestone, on sloping ground rising to a height of 400 feet</span></p>
