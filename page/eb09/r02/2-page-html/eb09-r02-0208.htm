<p><span class="font1">infringed a vow, and the labour is achieved by one even purer than himself among the Round Table heroes, namely, Galaad, the son of&nbsp;Lancelot. All this is of Map’s own invention, and much of it must&nbsp;have been posterior to Chrestien’s poem, in which (although based&nbsp;partly on Map and partly on Robert de Borron) Perceval remained&nbsp;the achiever of the quest.@@<sup>1</sup> The Borronesque view of Perceval as&nbsp;one of a line of successive Grail-custodians or Grail-kings impressed&nbsp;the imagination of Guyot de Provins, and led him to regard with&nbsp;contempt the pleasant episodes of Perceval’s youth as told by&nbsp;Chrestien. In Wolfram von Eschenbach’s poem there is a long&nbsp;succession of Grail-kings, beginning with Titurel, and ending with&nbsp;Partzifal (Perceval)@@<sup>2</sup> ; the scene of their rule is shifted to Anjou&nbsp;and Spain ; the story is said to draw its origin from a book found&nbsp;at Toledo ; several Moorish and Catalan names are found in it ;&nbsp;and finally the Grail-kings and their people are confounded with&nbsp;the Templars, struggling against the heathens. The romance of&nbsp;Perceval le Gallois, such as we have it since its first appearance&nbsp;in print in 1530, is a prose compilation derived from the poem&nbsp;begun by Chrestien de Troyes about 1180 and finished by Manessier&nbsp;about 1230.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">III. Lancelot.—This hero, like Perceval, has furnished an addition to European nomenclature. In this romance, which there is so much evidence for ascribing to the celebrated Walter Map (see&nbsp;above), the substance of Geoffrey’s Arthur, Guinevere, and Merlin&nbsp;was used as the introduction to a powerful fiction in which a new&nbsp;hero, Lancelot of the Lake, carries on an adulterous amour with&nbsp;Queen Guinevere, while at the same time he reveres and loves&nbsp;King Arthur and performs deeds of heroic daring under the influence of the most generous feelings. The tale, although lengthy&nbsp;and overladen with a crowd of adventures which have no bearing&nbsp;on the direct development of the plot, and notwithstanding the&nbsp;unpleasant nature of the chief subject, is one of extraordinary&nbsp;interest. The character of Lancelot remains unaltered throughout&nbsp;the course of the story, and is drawn with a masterly hand.&nbsp;Although his love is criminal, and he frequently does pious penance&nbsp;for his sins, yet his utter self-sacrificing devotion to the queen&nbsp;weakens by its exquisite fidelity the reader’s sense of his treachery&nbsp;towards the king, whom he never ceases to regard with a feeling&nbsp;of the deepest affection and reverence. His faults are such that&nbsp;he recognizes his own incompetence to become the achiever of the&nbsp;quest ; but he begets, upon Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles, a&nbsp;son Galaad, to whom the glory of winning the Grail and redeeming&nbsp;his father’s sins is reserved. Even here the romancer takes care&nbsp;to show that he was not untrue to Guinevere, his senses having&nbsp;been deceived by a spell (used by Elaine’s maid to gratify her&nbsp;mistress’s longing), which makes him imagine that his bedfellow&nbsp;is the queen. Nemesis begins to work when, upon a second use&nbsp;of the spell, Guinevere, after having waited for him in vain, finds&nbsp;him in the arms of King Pelles’s daughter. She reproaches him&nbsp;bitterly and drives him from her presence with such cruel words&nbsp;that he becomes insane and wanders about the woods and fields&nbsp;like Nebuchadnezzar. Some years elapse before he is recognized&nbsp;by Elaine, when chance takes him to the castle of Corbin, in&nbsp;which King Pelles has custody of the Grail. She cures him by&nbsp;means of the sacred vessel ; but it is not long before he quits her&nbsp;again and finds his way to Camelot. Arthur and the queen and&nbsp;his fellow-knights are rejoiced to see the lost Lancelot again,&nbsp;and the usual round of tournaments begins. We now come to the&nbsp;episode of Galaad. On the eve of Pentecost an old man dressed&nbsp;in white brings a youth to Arthur’s court. When all the knights&nbsp;are assembled at the ensuing banquet every seat is filled save that&nbsp;which was always left vacant for the Holy Grail, so that there is no&nbsp;place for young Galaad. Certain wondrous signs are pointed out&nbsp;by the old man which indicate that the “seat perilous” is meant&nbsp;to be filled by the young hero, who at once accomplishes another&nbsp;test which has foiled Gawain and Perceval. The Grail appears, and&nbsp;light and perfume fill the hall ; it passes away again, and the next&nbsp;day the knights depart upon the quest of the holy vessel, Arthur&nbsp;giving way to a pathetic regret that his merry company of Round&nbsp;Table champions is to be broken up for ever. Galaad, the pure&nbsp;knight, is the only one who succeeds, and becomes king of the&nbsp;Holy City ; then Joseph of Arimathea appears, and Galaad dies,&nbsp;his task accomplished. Gawain and Bors fail ; Lancelot and Perceval&nbsp;nearly succeed, but are foiled. Bors brings back an account of&nbsp;Perceval’s death, and Lancelot returns to court, a moody man ; he&nbsp;and Guinevere fall back into the old sin. The queen is accused of&nbsp;having poisoned a knight, and is exposed to the usual ordeal.&nbsp;Lancelot saves her by conquering her accuser, but receives wounds&nbsp;which break open at the next secret meeting between them. Scandal</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">has been busy ; spies are on the watch ; and, although, when the lovers are surprised, he escapes by dint of hard fighting, the stains&nbsp;of blood found in the queen’s bed are sufficient to condemn them.&nbsp;She is doomed to the stake, but at the moment of execution&nbsp;Lancelot appears and rescues her. They fly together to his castle&nbsp;of Joyeuse Garde, in which he is soon besieged by King Arthur,&nbsp;the king’s nephew Gawain, and the other faithful knights. He&nbsp;offers to give up the queen if no harm shall be done her ; Arthur&nbsp;rejects the offer ; and, after long fighting, news comes of a papal&nbsp;interdict promulgated against the kingdom so long as King Arthur&nbsp;refuses to take back his wife. Guinevere is then received by her&nbsp;husband, but Arthur is advised by Gawain to continue the war&nbsp;against Lancelot, whom he follows to his castle of Gannes in France.&nbsp;During the siege Arthur has tidings of an insurrection in Britain :&nbsp;his nephew Mordred has seized the throne, and the queen has&nbsp;fortified herself in London against the usurper. He returns, and&nbsp;after a series of desperate battles Mordred is killed and Arthur&nbsp;wounded to death. Flinging his sword away, the king disappears&nbsp;from mortal view and is borne by fairies to Avalon. Lancelot also&nbsp;returns to England, laments the king’s death, pays a mournful&nbsp;visit to the queen, now in a nunnery, retires himself to a monastery,&nbsp;and dies soon afterwards in sorrow and repentance. The original&nbsp;Lancelot was the true Arthur or Round Table romance, although&nbsp;when first written it probably contained no mention of Perceval&nbsp;and Galaad. To it all the other tales and episodes gravitated,&nbsp;and the above analysis represents probably its final form about&nbsp;the year 1200. When at a later period, in the 13th century, it&nbsp;was abridged, and the Bret (Tristan) also, and both of them amalgamated in the general Arthurian work now extant in many MSS.&nbsp;of the 14th and 15th centuries, the compilation came into existence&nbsp;which was translated into English by Sir Thomas Malory under the&nbsp;title Morte A rthur. The original complete Lancelot may be considered&nbsp;as a corporate work including the five branches which had previously been separate, namely, (1) Merlin ; (2) Arthur and the Round&nbsp;Table ; (3) Arthur, Guinevere, and Lancelot ; (4) Joseph of Arimathea and the Grail ; the Quest of the Grail and Perceval modified&nbsp;into (5) the new Quest of the Grail and Galaad. A sixth element&nbsp;was added in the French compilation, which formed the original&nbsp;of the Morte Arthur of Sir Thomas Malory, namely, (6) the story&nbsp;of Tristan and Yseult.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">V. Tristan.—This beautiful Breton or Cornish romance was originally a work totally independent of the Arthurian, Round&nbsp;Table, and Grail fictions ; and, if it is said by Hélie de Borron to&nbsp;have been left incomplete by its first author, the Anglo-Norman&nbsp;knight Luc or Luces, of the castle of Gast, Galt, or Gau, near Salisbury, and by Gasse li Blont (Eustace Blunt), who is spoken of as&nbsp;a continuator, we may presume that his statement was based&nbsp;upon no deficiency in the original narrative, but simply on the&nbsp;absence of all allusion to the Round Table. He therefore set to&nbsp;work to produce what he called the Bret, or the complete Tristan,&nbsp;by constructing a number of episodes which exhibit Tristan as one&nbsp;of the Round Table knights, as also having engaged in the quest,&nbsp;and as having been with his lady-love entertained for some time at&nbsp;Lancelot’s castle of Joyeuse Garde. The Saracen knight Palamedes,&nbsp;who takes an important place in the complete Tristan, and who&nbsp;is not one of the least interesting characters, seems to have been&nbsp;one of the additions. Whether the first author was really a knight&nbsp;or not, and whether he wrote in poetry or prose, it may here be&nbsp;said once for all that the earliest exoteric reference to the authors&nbsp;of the Round Table romances is that of Hélinand, who, writing&nbsp;close to the date of Walter Map’s death (c. 1210), mentioned them&nbsp;as “ quosdam proceres,” a phrase w<sup>τ</sup>hich could only be used as indicating personages ranking at least as high as knights. Tristan (in&nbsp;the old English form, Tristram) of Lyonesse is the nephew of King&nbsp;Mark of Cornwall.@@<sup>3</sup> Warned by a dwarf that his nephew’s existence&nbsp;will be pernicious to him, the king resolves to compass his death.&nbsp;His attempt is frustrated : the child is carried to the court of the&nbsp;Frank king Faramond, and there grows up towards man’s estate.&nbsp;He wins the love of Faramond’s daughter, on the discovery of&nbsp;which he is compelled to fly to his uncle at Tintagel, with whom&nbsp;a reconciliation is effected, A prince called Morhoult or the&nbsp;Morhoult@@<sup>4</sup> of Ireland lands in Cornwall to claim tribute of King&nbsp;Mark. Tristan challenges him to single combat, wounds him&nbsp;mortally, and compels him to reimbark in a dying condition, but&nbsp;is himself w<sup>,</sup>ounded by the poisoned lance of his adversary. Seeking afterwards a healer for his wounds, he is borne by the wind to&nbsp;Ireland, and well received by the king of Ireland and his daughter&nbsp;Yseult, who restore him to health. It is, however, observed that&nbsp;he is wearing the sword of Morhoult, and he is obliged to take a&nbsp;hasty departure. On his return to Cornwall the incidents of the&nbsp;complete Tristan begin to connect him with Arthur and the Round&nbsp;Table, but his victory over a knight, there said to have accused the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
