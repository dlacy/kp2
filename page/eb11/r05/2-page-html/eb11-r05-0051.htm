<p><span class="font0">while in decorative skill he seems to be descended from Titian and in colouring from Giulio Romano. Equally with this&nbsp;picture, “ The Transfiguration/<sup>1</sup> now in the museum at Nancy,&nbsp;and the portraits of “ Vincenzo and his Consort, kneeling before&nbsp;the Trinity/’ in the library at Mantua, claim a large share of&nbsp;attention.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Two years later we meet a very large altar-piece of “ The Circumcision ” at St Ambrogio at Genoa, the “ Virgin in a Glory&nbsp;of Angels/’ and two groups of Saints, painted on the wall, at&nbsp;both sides of the high altar in the church of Santa Maria in&nbsp;ValiceUa in Rome. These works remind us of a saying of&nbsp;Baglione, who was acquainted with Rubens in Italy: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Apprese&nbsp;egli buon gusto, e diede in una maniera buona Italiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While employed at Rome in 1608, Rubens received most alarming news as to the state of his mother’s health. The duke&nbsp;of Mantua was then absent from Italy, but the dutiful son,&nbsp;without awaiting his return, at once set out for the Netherlands.&nbsp;When he arrived in Antwerp, Maria Pypelincx was no more.&nbsp;However strong his wish might now be to return to Italy, his&nbsp;purpose was overruled by the express desire of his sovereigns,&nbsp;Albrecht and Isabella, to see him take up a permanent residence&nbsp;in the Belgian provinces. On the 3rd of August 1609 Rubens&nbsp;was named painter in ordinary to their Highnesses, with a&nbsp;salary of 500 livres, and “ the rights, honours, privileges, exemptions,” &amp;c.<sub>?</sub> belonging to persons of the royal household,&nbsp;not to speak of the gift of a gold chain. Not least in importance&nbsp;for the painter was his complete exemption from all the regulations of the gild of St Luke, entitEng him to engage any pupils&nbsp;or fellow-workers without being obEged to have them enrolled&nbsp;—a favour which has been of considerable trouble to the&nbsp;historians of Flemish art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although so recently returned to his native land, Rubens seems to have been, with one accord, accepted by his countrymen as the head of their school, and the municipaEty was&nbsp;foremost in giving him the means of proving his acquirements.&nbsp;The first in date among the numerous repetitions of the “Adoration of the Magi ” is a picture in the Madrid GaEery, measuring&nbsp;12 ft. by 17, and containing no fewer than eight-and-twenty&nbsp;life-size figures, many in gorgeous attire, warriors in steel&nbsp;armour, horsemen, slaves, camels, &amp;c. This picture, painted&nbsp;in Antwerp, at the town’s expense, in 1609, had scarcely remained three years in the town hall when it* went to Spain as&nbsp;a present to Don Rodrigo Calderon, count of OEva. The&nbsp;painter has represented himseE among the horsemen, bareheaded, and wearing his gold chain. From a letter written in&nbsp;May 1611 we know that more than a hundred young men were&nbsp;desirous to become his pupils, and that many had, “ for several&nbsp;years,” been waiting with other masters until he could admit&nbsp;them to his studio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Apart from the success of his works, another powerful motive had helped to detain the master in Antwerp—his marriage&nbsp;with Isabella Brant (October 1609). Many pictures have&nbsp;made us famiEar with the graceful young woman who was for&nbsp;seventeen years to share the master’s destinies. We meet her&nbsp;at the Hague, St Petersburg, BerEn, Florence, at Grosvenor&nbsp;House, but more especiaUy at Munich, where Rubens and his&nbsp;wife are depicted at fuU length on the same canvas. “His&nbsp;wife is very handsome,” observes Sir Joshua Reynolds, “and&nbsp;has an agreeable countenance;” but the picture, he adds,&nbsp;“ is rather hard in manner.” This, it must be noted, is the&nbsp;case with aU those pictures known to have immediately followed&nbsp;Rubens’s return, when he was stiU dependent on the assistance of painters trained by others than himseE. Even in the&nbsp;“ Raising of the Cross,” now in the Antwerp cathedral, and&nbsp;painted for the church of St Walburga in 1610, the dryness in&nbsp;outEne is very striking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to the taste stiU at that time prevailing, the picture is tripartite, but the wings only serve to develop the&nbsp;central composition, and add to the general effect. In Wit-doeck’s beautiful engraving the partitions even disappear.&nbsp;Thus, from the first, we see Rubens quite determined upon&nbsp;having his own way, and it is recorded that, when he painted&nbsp;the “ Descent from the Cross,” <sup>a</sup> St Christopher,” the subject&nbsp;chosen by the Arquebusiers, was altered so as to bring the&nbsp;artistic expressions into better accordance with his views.&nbsp;Although the subject was frequently repeated by the great&nbsp;painter, this first “ Descent from the Cross ” has not ceased&nbsp;to be looked upon as his masterpiece. Begun in 1611, the&nbsp;celebrated work was placed in 1614, and certainly no more&nbsp;striking evidence could be given of the rapid growth of the&nbsp;author’s abiEties. Rubens received 2400 florins for this picture.&nbsp;In many respects, Italian influence remains conspicuous in&nbsp;the “ Descent from the Cross.” Rubens had seen RicciareUi’s&nbsp;fresco at the Trinità de’ Monti, and was also acquainted with&nbsp;the grandiose picture of Baroccio in the cathedral of Perugia,&nbsp;and no one conversant with these works can mistake their&nbsp;influence. But in Rubens strength of personaEty could not&nbsp;be overpowered by reminiscence; and in type, as weU as in&nbsp;colouring, the “ Descent from the Cross ” may be termed&nbsp;thoroughly Flemish and Rubenesque.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If Sir Dudley Carleton could speak of Antwerp in 1616 as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Magna eivitas, magna solitudo,</span><span class="font0"> there was no place nevertheless which could give a wider scope to artistic enterprise. Spain&nbsp;and the United Provinces were for a time at peace; almost&nbsp;aU the churches had been stripped of their adornments;&nbsp;monastic orders were powerful and richly endowed, gilds and&nbsp;corporations eager to show the fervour of their CathoEc faith,&nbsp;now that the “ monster of heresy ” seemed for ever queEed.&nbsp;Gothic churches began to be decorated according to the new&nbsp;fashion adopted in Italy. Altars magnified to monuments,&nbsp;sometimes reaching the fuU height of the vaulted roof, displayed, between their twisted columns, pictures of a size hitherto&nbsp;unknown. No master seemed better fitted to be associated&nbsp;with this kind of painting than Rubens. The temple erected&nbsp;by the reverend fathers in Antwerp was almost entirely the&nbsp;painter’s work, and if he did not, as we often find asserted,&nbsp;design the front, he certainly was the inspirer of the whole&nbsp;building. Hitherto no Fleming had undertaken to paint&nbsp;ceilings with foreshortened figures, and blend the reEgious&nbsp;with the decorative art after the style of those buildings which&nbsp;are met with in Italy, and owe their decorations to masters&nbsp;Eke Titian, Veronese and Tintoretto. No fewer than forty&nbsp;ceiEng-panels were composed by Rubens, and painted under his&nbsp;direction in the space of two years. AE were destroyed by&nbsp;fire in 1718. Sketches in water-colour were taken some time&nbsp;before the disaster by de Wit, and from these were made the&nbsp;etchings by Du Pont which alone enable us to form a judgment&nbsp;of the grandiose undertaking. In the Madrid GaUery we<sup>v</sup>find&nbsp;a general view of the church in aU its splendour. The present&nbsp;church of St Charles in Antwerp is, externaUy, with some&nbsp;alteration, the building here aUuded to.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens deEghted in undertakings of the vastest kind. “ The large size of a picture,” he writes to W. TrumbuU in 1621, “ gives&nbsp;us painters more courage to represent our ideas with the utmost&nbsp;freedom and semblance of reaEty. ... I confess myseE to be,&nbsp;by a natural instinct, better fitted to execute works of the&nbsp;largest size.” The correctness of this appreciation he was&nbsp;very soon called upon to demonstrate most strikingly by a&nbsp;series of twenty-four pictures, iUustrating the Efe of Marie de&nbsp;Médicis, queen-mother of France. The gaUery at the Luxembourg Palace, which these paintings once adorned, has long&nbsp;since disappeared, and the complete work is not exhibited in&nbsp;the Louvre. Drawings, it seems, had been asked from Quentin&nbsp;Varin, the French master who incited Poussin to become a&nbsp;painter, but Rubens was ultimately preferred. This preference&nbsp;may in some degree be ascribed to his former connexion with&nbsp;the court at Mantua, Marie de Médicis and the duchess of&nbsp;Gonzaga being sisters. From the cradle to the day of her&nbsp;reconciEation with Louis XIII., we follow Marie de NTédicis&nbsp;after the manner in which it was customary in those days to&nbsp;consider personages of superior rank. The Fates for her have&nbsp;spun the silken and golden thread; Juno watches over her&nbsp;birth and entrusts her to the town of Florence; Minerva,&nbsp;the Graces and Apollo take charge of her education; Love</span></p>
