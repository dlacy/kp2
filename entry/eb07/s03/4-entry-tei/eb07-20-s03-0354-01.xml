a large town on the Niger, by which the travels of Mr. Park were bounded towards the east. He gives no particular description of the place, which his health and spirits permitted him not to survey, but assigns the reasons by which he was induced to proceed no farther. On his arrival, he was allowed to remain under a tree, till it was quite dark, surrounded by hundreds of people. But their language was extremely different from the other parts of Bambarra ; and he was given to understand, that in his progress eastward, the Bambarra tongue was very little understood, and that, on his reaching Jenn√©, he would find the greater part of the inhabitants accustomed to speak a different language. He had now become the prey of sickness, exhausted with hunger and fatigue, half naked, and without any article of value to procure for himself provisions, clothes, or lodging, on which account he resolved to return, finding that to prosecute his journey further in that direction was wholly impracticable. Siila, according to the latest map pf Africa, is in 14. 48. N. lat. and 1. 24. W. long.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
