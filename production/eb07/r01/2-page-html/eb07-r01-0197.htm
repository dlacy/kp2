<p><span class="font0">From this period Sir Joshua never painted more. The last effort of his pencil was the portrait of Charles James&nbsp;Fox, which was executed in his best style, and shows that&nbsp;his fancy, his imagination, and his other great powers in the&nbsp;art which he professed, remained unabated to the end of&nbsp;his life. When the last touches were given to this picture,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The hand of Reynolds fell, to rise no more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On Thursday the 23d of February 1792, the world was deprived of this amiable man and excellent artist, at the age of sixty-eight years ; a man than whom no one, according&nbsp;to Johnson, had passed through life with more observation&nbsp;of men and manners. The following character of him is&nbsp;said to be the production of Mr Burke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ His illness was long, but borne with a mild and cheerful fortitude, without the least mixture of anything irritable or querulous, agreeably to the placid and even tenor of his&nbsp;whole life. He had from the beginning of his malady a distinct view of his dissolution, which he contemplated with&nbsp;that entire cotnposure which nothing but the innocence, integrity, and usefulness of his life, and an unaffected submission to the will of Providence, could bestow. In this&nbsp;situation he had every consolation from family tenderness,&nbsp;which his tenderness to his family had always merited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Sir Joshua Reynolds was, on very many accounts, one of the most memorable men of his time ; he was the first&nbsp;Englishman who added the praise of the elegant arts to the&nbsp;other glories of his country. In taste, in grace, in facility,&nbsp;in happy invention, and in the richness and harmony of colouring, he was equal to the great masters of the renowned&nbsp;ages. In portrait he went beyond them ; for he communicated to that description of the art in which English artists are the most engaged, a variety, a fancy, and a dignity,&nbsp;derived from the higher branches, which even those who&nbsp;professed them in a superior manner did not always preserve when they delineated individual nature. His portraits&nbsp;remind the spectator of the invention of history and the&nbsp;amenity of landscape. In painting portraits he appears not&nbsp;to be raised upon that platform, but to descend to it from a&nbsp;higher sphere. His paintings illustrate his lessons, and his&nbsp;lessons seem to be derived from his paintings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ He possessed the theory as perfectly as the practice of his art. To be such a painter, he was a profound and penetrating philosopher.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ In full happiness of foreign and domestic fame, admired by the expert in art, and by the learned in science, courted by the great, caressed by sovereign powers, and&nbsp;celebrated by distinguished poets, his native humility, modesty, and candour never forsook him, even on surprise or&nbsp;provocation ; nor was the least degree of arrogance or assumption visible to the scrutinizing eye in any part of his&nbsp;conduct or discourse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ His talents of every kind, powerful from nature, and not meanly cultivated in letters, his social virtues in all the&nbsp;relations and all the habitudes of life, rendered him the&nbsp;centre of a very great and unparalleled variety of agreeable&nbsp;societies, which will be dissipated by his death. He had&nbsp;too much merit not to excite some jealousy, too much innocence to provoke any enmity. The loss of no man of his&nbsp;time can be felt with more sincere, general, and unmixed&nbsp;sorrow.” See Painting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REZΛT, a circle of the kingdom of Bavaria, formed out of the ancient Southern Franconia, in the principality of Ans-pach, out of Bavarian Unterland, and the territories of the&nbsp;former free states of Nuremberg, Rottenburg, Windsheim,&nbsp;and Weissenbourg. It extends over 3052 square miles, and&nbsp;is bounded on the north-west by the circle of the Lower&nbsp;Maine, and on the north-east by that of the Upper Maine,&nbsp;on the east by that of the Regen, on the south by that of&nbsp;the Upper Maine, and on the west by the territory of the&nbsp;kingdom of Wirtemberg. The circle is divided into forty-one bailiwicks, which comprehend forty-two cities or towns&nbsp;once walled, fifty-five market-towns, and 2004 villages, with&nbsp;530,726 inhabitants, of whom the far greater part are Lutherans, and most of the rest still adhere to the Catholic church.&nbsp;It is generally a level or undulating district, whose waters&nbsp;are partly conveyed by the smaller rivers to the Danube,&nbsp;but the greater portion by the Maine to the Rhine. It is&nbsp;the best cultivated, the most populous, and the most productive division of the kingdom. It yields abundance of&nbsp;corn and cattle, some wine, and all the various kinds of common fruits. Its manufactures also are extensive, especially&nbsp;near Nuremberg, but having little water communication,&nbsp;the chief commodities are conveyed by land-carriage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHABDOLOGY, or Rabdology, in arithmetic, a name given by Napier of Merchiston, the inventor of logarithms,&nbsp;to a method of performing some of the more difficult operations of numbers by means of square little rods. Upon these&nbsp;are inscribed the simple numbers ; then, by shifting them&nbsp;according to certain rules, those operations are performed&nbsp;by simply adding or subtracting the numbers as they stand&nbsp;upon the rods.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHADAMANTHUS, a severe judge, and king of Lydia. The poets make him one of the three judges of hell.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHADEN, a town of the Prussian province of Westphalia, in the government of Minden, and the capital of the circle of the same name, which extends over 180 square&nbsp;miles, inhabited by 30,000 persons. The town is on the&nbsp;new canal, and contains 390 houses, with 2680 inhabitants,&nbsp;who make large quantities of linen and of woollen yam.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHAMA, or Rama, an incarnate deity of the first rank, in Indian mythology. Sir William Jones believes he was&nbsp;the Dionysos of the Greeks, whom they named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bromius,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">without knowing why ; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bugenes</span><span class="font0"> when they represented him </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">honied,</span><span class="font0"> as well as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lyaois</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eleutherios</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;deliverer, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tryarnbos</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dithyrambos</span><span class="font0"> the triumphant.&nbsp;“ Most of those titles,” says Sir William, “ were adopted by&nbsp;the Romans, by whom he was called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bruma, Tauriformis,&nbsp;Liber,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Triumphus ;</span><span class="font0"> and both nations had records or&nbsp;traditionary accounts of his giving laws to men and deciding their contests, of his improving navigation and commerce, and, what may appear yet more observable, of his&nbsp;conquering India and other countries with an army of satyrs,&nbsp;commanded by no less a personage than Pan ; whom Lil-Hus Gyraldus, on what authority I know not, asserts to have&nbsp;resided in Iberia, ‘ when he had returned,’ says the learned&nbsp;mythologist, ‘ from the Indian war, in which he accompanied&nbsp;Bacchus.’ It were superfluous in a mere essay to run any&nbsp;length in the parallel between this European god and tlle&nbsp;sovereign of Ayodhya, whom the Hindus believe to have&nbsp;been an appearance on earth of the preserving power ; to&nbsp;have been a conqueror of the highest renown, and the deliverer of nations from tyrants, as well as of his consort Sita&nbsp;from the giant Ravan king of Lanca ; and to have commanded in chief a numerous and intrepid race of those&nbsp;large monkeys, which our naturalists, or some of them, have&nbsp;denominated Indian satyrs. This general, the prince of&nbsp;satyrs, was named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hanurnat,</span><span class="font0"> or ‘ with high cheek-bones ;’&nbsp;and with workmen of such agility, he soon raised a bridge&nbsp;of rocks over the sea, part of which, say the Hindus, yet remains ; and it is probably the series of rocks to which the&nbsp;Mussulmans or Portuguese have given the foolish name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Adam’s,</span><span class="font0"> or, as it should be called, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rama’s</span><span class="font0"> Bridge. Might&nbsp;not this army of satyrs have been only a race of mountaineers, whom Rama, if such a monarch ever existed, had&nbsp;civilized? However that may be, the large breed of Indian apes is at this moment held in high veneration by the&nbsp;Hindus, and fed with devotion by the Brahmins, who seem&nbsp;in two or three places on the banks of the Ganges to have&nbsp;a regular endowment for the support of them ; they live in</span></p>
