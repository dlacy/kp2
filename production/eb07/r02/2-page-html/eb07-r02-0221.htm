<p><span class="font0">pressed and smoothed in the same manner as by the cloth in hand-spinning. From these tubes the threads are led to&nbsp;the flyers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb</span><span class="font0"> and bobbins cc, as in the ordinary spinning apparatus. Any degree of twist and of tension during twisting&nbsp;can be given to the yarn, by making the bobbins take up&nbsp;more or less of it for each revolution of the flyer ; and this&nbsp;is simply effected by means of a drag formed of two steel&nbsp;springs fixed to the bobbin-rail. The ends of the springs&nbsp;partly embrace a peculiarly-formed pulley attached to the&nbsp;bottom of the bobbin, and by means of a pinching screw&nbsp;they can be made to bear with a greater or less degree of&nbsp;pressure on this pulley, and, according to the amount of&nbsp;pressure, the motion of the bobbin is in a greater or less&nbsp;degree retarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These machines differ from those in common use chiefly in the following particulars: 1st, In the distance between the&nbsp;feeding rollers and drawing rollers being capable of alteration, to suit longer or shorter hemp, by means of the&nbsp;grooves in the framing of the machines, seen in the side&nbsp;view, fig. 14; 2dly, in making the yarn to pass through the&nbsp;compressible tubes and the felt discs, which act in a manner analogous to the cloth in the grasp of the workman in&nbsp;hand-spinning ; 3dly, in the power which the manufacturer&nbsp;has in regulating the tension and twist of the yarns while&nbsp;forming, by means of the drag applied to the bobbins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The yam produced by this machine is of excellent quality, and is much stronger than hand-spun yarn, as appears from certain experiments made for the purpose of testing&nbsp;them ; the result showing, “ that the patent-spun yarns are&nbsp;stronger than those of equal grist when spun by hand, and&nbsp;from the best staple or long hemp, by fifty-five per cent.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Lang’s machinery has in consequence been adopted by some of the most extensive rope-manufacturers in Great&nbsp;Britain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1832. August 8th, Mr Crawhall obtained a patent for&nbsp;an improvement in the manufacture of flat rope, such as is&nbsp;used in mines. It will be remembered that in Mr Curr’s&nbsp;patent, the method described of forming these bands was by&nbsp;sewing several ropes together side by side ; and the improvement of Mr Crawhall consists in adding such wheels to the&nbsp;ordinary rope-work machinery as to enable it to make four&nbsp;ropes of the same size, of the same material, twisted in the&nbsp;same manner, and at the same time. By this equality of&nbsp;the ropes greater strength is insured ; and they are put together by sewing or plaiting, as in the other patents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1832. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;September 22d, Mr J. H. Kyan obtained a patent&nbsp;for the application to cordage of his now well-known process of steeping materials in a solution of deuto-chloride of&nbsp;mercury for the purpose of preserving them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1833. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May. Mr Norvel of Newcastle at this time took&nbsp;out a patent for machinery for rope-making. In this machinery the bobbins are, like Mr Walker’s, arranged on the&nbsp;surface of cylindrical flyers, and in some of its other parts&nbsp;there is a resemblance to that of Mr Chapman ; but there&nbsp;is much that is new, and the general arrangement appears&nbsp;to be excellent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1838. August 8, a patent was obtained by Mr John Stewart, rope-manufacturer in Glasgow, for machinery for&nbsp;spinning yarn, and forming lines, cords, and ropes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In figs. 19 and 20 a side and end view of the machine for spinning are exhibited. Here </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aaa</span><span class="font0"> is the framing ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">by,</span><span class="font0"> a fast&nbsp;and loose pulley on the principal shaft ; ccc, bevel-wheels&nbsp;on the same shaft, gearing into pinions fixed on the frames&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ddd,</span><span class="font0"> which run in two bearings, one at the foot, and· the&nbsp;other at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">eee,</span><span class="font0"> fixed to the rail of the frame ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ftf</span><span class="font0"> arc sliver-cans, with projecting pins for hanging them in the hooks of&nbsp;the frames </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dd,</span><span class="font0"> so that any can may be shifted without disturbing the machinery; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gg</span><span class="font0"> is a roller moved by a belt&nbsp;on the principal shaft, round which roller a turn of the&nbsp;thread is taken as it comes from the cans, and the motion&nbsp;of the roller, which may be increased or diminished at plea</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">sure, draws the thread away from the can more or less rapidly. The action of the machine will now be easily understood. The cans having been filled with sliver at the common drawing-frame, are hung in the hooks of the&nbsp;frames ; on motion being communicated to the machine,&nbsp;the frames are turned round, and twist the sliver into a&nbsp;thread ; and as it is twisted, it is drawn away by the&nbsp;roller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An essential part of the machine remains yet to be described. This is the nipper, or apparatus for holding tightly and regulating the twist of the sliver ; one of these is fixed to each frame above its upper bearing. Fig. 21 is a&nbsp;section, and fig. 22 a plan, of one</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the nippers to a large scale. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">it </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">aa</span><span class="font0"> is a part of one of the frames,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb</span><span class="font0"> the upper bearing, cc the hole</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">through which the sliver passes, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">a pinching screw to fix the nipper</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">in the top of the frame ; the part e</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">works through a parallel mortise</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">cut through the part </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ff</span><span class="font0"> of the nip</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">per. By turning the nut </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gg</span><span class="font0"> the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">part ce is thrust into the mortise,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">so as to allow the sliver to pass</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">through cc with more or less free</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">dom, as may be required. Any ir</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">regularity in the thickness of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">yarns is provided for by the spring</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Λ/i, which allows </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> to yield a little when a part of the yarn happens to be thicker, or forces it&nbsp;inwards when any part happens to&nbsp;be smaller, than the general size,&nbsp;while the steady pressure is maintained by means of the nut </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Through this part of the apparatus, then, the end of the sliver is put previous to being carried to&nbsp;the roller, and it is between this&nbsp;and the roller that the sliver receives its twist to convert it into a thread or yarn. When&nbsp;the yarns leave the roller they are wound on bobbins, or&nbsp;made use of in some other manner. The patentee describes a method of putting a slight twist into the slivers&nbsp;before the cans are hung in the frames of this machine.&nbsp;He also describes a modification of the frame, in which, in&nbsp;place of the cans, bobbins may be used ; and he describes&nbsp;an apparatus for filling the bobbins. His machinery for&nbsp;forming lines, cords, strands, and ropes is represented in</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
