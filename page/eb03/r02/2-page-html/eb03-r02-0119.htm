<p><span class="font0">ries of the Latins ſerved for a pretence to begin the war ; but as Tarquin had no confidence in the Romans,&nbsp;his army was compoſed only of a ſmall body of them&nbsp;who were incorporated among the Latin auxiliaries.&nbsp;However, he defeated the enemy, took one of their cities by ſtorm, and gave the booty to his ſoldiers. He&nbsp;next turned his arms againſt the Sabines, whom he entirely defeated in two engagements, and made the&nbsp;whole nation tributary ; for which exploits he decreed&nbsp;himſelf two triumphs, and on his return to Rome he&nbsp;employed the populace in finiſhing the ſewers and&nbsp;circus which had been begun by his grandfather Tarquin I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time, the perſecutions of Tarquin a-gainſt his own ſubjects daily drove ſome of the moſt conſiderable into baniſhment. A great number of patricians took refuge in Gabii, a city of Latium about 13&nbsp;miles from Rome 5 where the inhabitants, touched with&nbsp;compaſſion for their misfortunes, not only received them&nbsp;with kindneſs, but began a war with 'Γarquin on their&nbsp;account. The Gabini ſeem to have been the moſt formidable enemies whom the Romans had hitherto met&nbsp;with ; ſince Tarquin was obliged to raiſe a prodigious&nbsp;bulwark to cover the city on the ſide of Gabii. The&nbsp;war laſted ſeven years ; during which time, by the mutual devaſtations committed by the two armies, a great&nbsp;ſcarcity of proviſions took place in Rome. The people&nbsp;ſoon grew clamorous ; and Tarquin being unable either&nbsp;to quiet them, or to reduce the Gabini, fell upon the&nbsp;following diſhonourable and treacherous expedient. His&nbsp;ſon Sextus Tarquinius pretended to be on very bad&nbsp;terms with his father, and openly inveighed againſt him&nbsp;as a tyrant ; on which he was proclaimed a rebel, and&nbsp;publicly beaten in the forum. This being reported at&nbsp;Gabii, by perſons lent thither on purpoſe, the inhabitants became very deſirous of having Sextus among&nbsp;them ; and accordingly he ſoon went thither, having&nbsp;previouſly obtained a ſolemn promiſe from the inhabitants never to deliver him up to his father. Here he&nbsp;made frequent inroads into the Roman territories, and&nbsp;always came back laden with ſpoil, his father ſending&nbsp;againſt him only ſuch weak parties as muſt infallibly be&nbsp;worſted. By this means he ſoon came to have ſuch a&nbsp;high degree of credit among the Gabini, that he was&nbsp;choſen general of their army, and was as much maſter&nbsp;at Gabii as Tarquin was at Rome. Finding then that&nbsp;his authority was ſufficiently eſtabliſhed, he diſpatched&nbsp;a ſlave to his father for inſtructions ; but the king, unwilling to return an explicit anſwer, only took the meſ-ſenger into the garden, where he ſtruck off the heads&nbsp;of the talleſt poppies. Sextus undeι ſtood that by this&nbsp;hint the king deſired him to put to death the leading&nbsp;men in the city of Gabii, which he immediately put in&nbsp;execution ; and while the city was in confuſion on account of this maſſacre, he opened the gates to his father, who took poſſeſſion of the city with all the pride&nbsp;of a conqueror.·—The inhabitants dreaded every thing&nbsp;from the haughty tyranny of the Roman monarch :&nbsp;however, on tins occaſion he conſulted his policy rather&nbsp;than his revenge ; granted them their lite, liberty, and&nbsp;eſtates, and even entered into a treaty of alliance with&nbsp;them. The articles were written on the hide of an ox,&nbsp;which was ſtill to be ſeen in the time of Auguſtus, in&nbsp;the temple of Jupiter Fidius. After this, however, he&nbsp;made his ſon Sextus king of Gabii ; lending off alſo</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">his two other ſons, Titus and Arunx, the one to build a city at Signia, the other at Circæum, a promontory&nbsp;of the Tyrrhene ſea, and both theſe to keep the Volſci&nbsp;in awe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For ſome time Tarquin now enjoyed a profound peace ; the Romans, being accuſtomed to oppreſſion&nbsp;and the yoke of an imperious maſter, malting no oppoſition to his will. During this interval Tarquin&nbsp;met with the celebrated adventure of the Sibyl f ;&nbsp;whoſe books were ever afterwards held in high eſtima-tion at Rome, and Tarquin appointed two perſons of&nbsp;diſtinction to take carc of them. Thoſe were called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Duumviri :</span><span class="font0"> but their number was afterwards increaſed&nbsp;to 10, when they were called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Decemviri ;</span><span class="font0"> and then to&nbsp;15, when they were termed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Quindecemviri.</span><span class="font0"> At this&nbsp;time alſo the written civil law had its origin among the&nbsp;Romans ; all the ſtatutes enacted by the kings being&nbsp;collected into one body ; which, from Papirius the&nbsp;name of the collector, was called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Papiriaa</span><span class="font0"> law. The&nbsp;temple of the Capitol was alſo finiſhed; for which purpoſe the moſt ſkilful architects and workmen were&nbsp;brought from Hetruria, the populace being obliged to&nbsp;ſerve them in the moſt laborious parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We now come to the important revolution which put an end to the regal power at Rome, and introduced a&nbsp;new form of government, to which this city is allowed&nbsp;to owe the greateſt part of her grandeur. Tarquin, as&nbsp;we have already ſeen, had left himſelf no friends among&nbsp;the rich citizens, by reaſon of the oppreſſion under&nbsp;which he made them labour ; and the populace were&nbsp;equally diſaffected on account of their being obliged to&nbsp;labour in his public works. Among the many perſons&nbsp;of diſtinction who had been ſacrificed to the avarice or&nbsp;ſuſpicions of Tarquin, was one M. Junius, who had&nbsp;married the daughter of Tarquin I. This nobleman&nbsp;had a ſon named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L. Junius Brutus,</span><span class="font0"> who eſeaped the&nbsp;cruelty of the tyrant by pretending to be an idiot,&nbsp;which part he had ever ſince continued to act. Sooh&nbsp;after the finiſhing of the w0rk3 abovementioned, a violent plague happening to break out at Rome, Tarquin&nbsp;ſent bis ſons Titus and Arunk to conſult the oracle of&nbsp;Delphi ; and the princes took Brutus along with them,&nbsp;to divert themſelves with his pretended folly by the&nbsp;way. Brutus choſe for his offering to the Delphic A-pollo a ſtick of elder ; which occaſioned much laughter. However, he had the precaution to incloſe a rod&nbsp;of gold within the ſtick ; and to this probably it was&nbsp;owing, that the prieſteſs gave the princes the following&nbsp;riddle, that he who ſhould firſt kiſs his mother ſhould&nbsp;ſucceed Tarquin in the government of Rome. This&nbsp;anſwer had been given to their inquiries concerning the&nbsp;ſucceſſion ; upon which the two brothers either drew&nbsp;lots which of them ſhould kiſs their mother at their return, or agreed to do it at once, that both might reign&nbsp;jointly ; but Brutus, imagining the oracle had another&nbsp;meaning, fell down and kiſſed the earth, the common&nbsp;mother of all living. This, in all probability, the&nbsp;prieſteſs had meant ; and had given the anſwer on purpoſe to have another proof of Brutus’s ingenuity, which&nbsp;had already diſcovered itſelf, by his offering the elder&nbsp;ſtick.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">On the return of the princes to Rome, they found, their father engaged in a war with the Rutuli. The&nbsp;treaſury being exhauſted by the ſums which Γarquin&nbsp;had expended in his public works, he had marched to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
