His first treatise was the Antiquities of Canterbury, which he dedicated to Archbishop Laud. He then applied himself to the study of the Saxon language ; and having made himself master of it, he perceived that the old glossary prefixed to Sir Roger Twisdenâ€™s edition of the laws of King Henry I. printed in 1644, was faulty in many places ; he therefore added to that edition notes and observations valuable for their learning, with a very useful glossary. His Treatise of Gavelkind was finished about 1648, though not published till 1660. Somner was zealously attached to King Charles 1. ; and in 1648 he published a poem on his sufferings and death. His skill in the Saxon tongue led him to inquire into most of the European languages, ancient and modem. He assisted Dugdale and Dodsworth in compiling the <hi rend="italic">Monasticon Anglicanum.</hi> His Saxon Dictionary was printed at Oxford in 1659. He died in 1669.</p><p>SOMPRE, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Cashmere, situated on the east side of the Jhylum river. Long. 73. 25. E. Lat. 34, 17. N.</p><p>SONATA (<hi rend="italic">Ital.</hi>), a piece of music, consisting of various movements for a single instrument, with or without accompaniment. The name has sometimes been given to cer tain vocal compositions, in which all the voices are equally essential. Some of the most remarkable modern sonatas are for the pianoforte, such as those of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven, Clementi, Dussek, &amp;c. Formerly sonatas were classed as <hi rend="italic">sonate di camera</hi> and <hi rend="italic">sonate di chiesa,</hi> i.e. <hi rend="italic">chambersonatas</hi> and <hi rend="italic">churchsonatas,</hi> on account of their difference of style, and the place of performance.</p><p>SONATINA (<hi rend="italic">Ital.</hi>), a short and easy sonata.</p><p>SONDERHAUSEN, the capital of the principality of SchwartzburgSonderhausen, in Germany, stands on the river Wipper, at the junction of the Bebra with that stream. It is well built, and the castle on which the prince resides is situated on a hill overlooking the city ; it is a venerable object, with some pleasing promenades near to it. The city contains a gymnasium, two churches, and an orphan house, 460 dwellings, and 3600 inhabitants. Long. 10. 45.</p><p>1.	E. Lat. 51. 22. 33.

It is about twenty leagues in circumference. Long. 148. W. Lat. 15. S.</p><p>SONDRIO, a delegation of the Austrian kingdom of Lombardy, extending over 1139 square miles, is bounded on the north by Switzerland, on the east by the Tyrol, on the south by Bergamo, on the southwest by Como, and on the west by Switzerland. It comprehends an extensive valley, with lofty mountains on both sides, sometimes called the Valteline. It contains one city, six towns, and seventy eight villages, with 91,600 inhabitants. The capital is a city of the same name, situatcd at the entrance of the valley,</p><p>on the river Moller. It contains 3480 inhabitants.</p><p>SONEHUT, a small town and mudfort of Hindustan, in the province of Gundwana. Long. 82. 33. E. Lat. 23. 33.

N.</p><p>SONG, in <hi rend="italic">Music,</hi> in a general sense, applies to melody, whether vocal or instrumental. It is usually applied to an air adapted to the words of a short poem. Sometimes, with an adjunct, it means a particular form of melody, as <hi rend="italic">plait; song</hi> (Fr. <hi rend="italic">plain chant;</hi> Ital. <hi rend="italic">canto piano,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">canto ferma). </hi>Among songs, the most characteristic and interesting are the national ones of various countries. To the influence of national song may be traced those remarkable changes and improvements in the style of melody, with regard to free</p><p>dom and expression, that are so perceptible in the music of professed composers within the last two centuries.</p><p>Song <hi rend="smallcaps">of Birds</hi>. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Singing</hi>, and Philosophical Transactions, vol. 1xiii.</p><p>SONGHUR, a town of Hindustan, in the Gujerat peninsula, situated in a wild country, twenty-five miles north west from Wankaneer. Near it is a very ancient temple dedicated to the sun, and adorned with a variety of sculptures, in a style greatly superior to any modern works by the Hindus. In the interior of this temple is a male figure, three feet high, with uplifted hands, each holding an image of the sun ; and on his two sides are two smaller idols of the same kind. There are also two other temples, one of which contains the figure of Bhavani standing on an animal resembling a tortoise, and surrounded by female attendants. There is no record concerning the time when these temples were built</p><p>SONGI, a small river on the eastern coast of Malacca, falls into the China Sea. Lat. 2. 10.

It is situated on the great canal, very conveniently for trade, which is carried on to a considerable extent in calicoes and other cotton cloths. It has four large cities under its jurisdiction. It is 560 miles south of Pekin. Long. 120. 44. E. Lat. 31. N.</p><p>SONGMENCHAN, a small island near the coast of the province Tchekiang, in China. Long. 121. 21. E. Lat. 31.

N.</p><p>SOOLOO <hi rend="smallcaps">Isles.</hi> These isles, about sixty in number, derive their name from Sooloo, the principal island in the group. They form a chain which extends in a northeast and southwest direction, from the northeastern extremity of Borneo to the western extremity of Magindanao, and from the 4th to the 7th degrees of north latitude. The island of Sooloo is about thirty miles in length by twelve in average breadth, and contains 60,000 inhabitants. It lies midway between the islands of Borneo and Magindanao, is well cultivated, and affords a fine prospect from the sea ; nor has it any certain rainy seasons, like the other Malay islands. This is owing to the moderate height of the hills not intercepting the clouds in their passage from the sea. Most rain falls, however, during the southwest monsoon, and also at the change of the monsoon, especially the au tumnal. But these changes are not followed by any storms, and very seldom at any other time, so that the island enjoys almost a perpetual summer. There are several good harbours among these islands, particularly at Bewabewa, Tavitave, Tappool, Secassee, between Boobooan and Tap peantana, south of Basselan. The harbour of Bewan, the capital of Sooloo, is not good, except during the southwest monsoon. This place is situated on the seacoast, on the northwest part of the island, and is of considerable size. The houses are built after the manner of the Malays, elevated about four feet from the ground with bamboos, of which the floors also are made. The island of Sooloo being small in proportion to its population, habits of industry prevail, and great attention is paid to agriculture. Rice is planted ; but it is a precarious crop, owing to the uncertainty of the rains. Many roots are in consequence cultivated in its stead, namely, the Spanish or sweet potatoe, and yams of different species. They have abundance and variety of every species of tropical fruit. The oranges are equal in quality to those in China : they have also a fruit called jack or nanka, durians, a kind of large custard apple, called madang, mangoes, mangustines, rambustines, and a fruit they call bolona, like a large plum or mangoe, white inside. The trees in the woods are loaded with fruits, which ripen well, and are not injured by too much mois</p></body></text></TEI>
