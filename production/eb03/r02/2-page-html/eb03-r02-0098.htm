<p><span class="font0">ROGATION (rogatio), in the Roman juriſprudence, a demand made by the conſuls or tribunes of the Roman people, when a law was propoſed to be paſſed.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rogatio</span><span class="font0"> is alſo uſed for the decree itſelf made in conſequence of the people’s giving their aſſent to this demand ; to diſtinguiſh it from a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſenatus conſultum,</span><span class="font0"> or decree of the ſenate.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROGER de Hoveden, a learned man of the 13th century, was born in Yorkſhire, moſt probably at the&nbsp;town of that name, now called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ho&lt;ιvden,</span><span class="font0"> ſome time in&nbsp;the reign of Henry I. After he had received the firſt&nbsp;parts of education in his native country, he ſtudied the&nbsp;civil and canon law, which were then become the moſt&nbsp;faſhionable and lucrative branches of learning. He&nbsp;became domeſtic chaplain to Henry II. who employed him to tranfa&lt;ct ſeveral eccleſiaſtical affairs ; in which&nbsp;he acquitted himſelf with honour. But his moſt meritorious work was, his Annals of England, from A. D.&nbsp;731, when Bede’s Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory ends, to A. D.&nbsp;1202. This work, which is one of the moſt voluminous of our ancient hiſtories, is more valuable for the&nbsp;ſincerity with which it is written, and the great variety&nbsp;of facts which it contains, than for the beauty of its&nbsp;ſtyle, or the regularity of its arrangement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROGUE, in law, an idle ſturdy beggar ; who by ancient ſtatutes is for the firſt offence called a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rogue of&nbsp;the firſt degree,</span><span class="font0"> and puniſhed by whipping, and boring&nbsp;through the griſtle of the right ear with a hot iron ;&nbsp;and for the ſecond offence, is termed a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rogue of the ſecond degree,</span><span class="font0"> and, if above 18 years of age, ordered to&nbsp;be executed as a felon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROHAN (Peter de), Chevalier de Gié, and mar-ſhal of France, better known by the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marſhal de Gié,</span><span class="font0"> was the ſon of Louis de Rohan, the firſt of&nbsp;the name, lord of Guémené and Montauban, and deſeended of one of the moſt ancient and moſt illuſtrious&nbsp;families of the kingdom. The family of Rohan, be-foι e the Revolution, held the rank of prince in France</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">in conſequence of deriving its origin from the firſt ſovereigns of Brittany, and clearly admitted by the dukes of Brittany themſelves in the ſtates general of that&nbsp;province held in ι 088. The houſe of Rohan had ſtill&nbsp;another advantage, which was common to it with very&nbsp;few families, even the moſt diſtinguiſhed among the&nbsp;princes, namely, that inſtead of having been aggrandi-ſed by the wealth procured from alliances, it had held in&nbsp;itſelf for ſeven centuries the largeſt poſſeſſions of any family in the kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One of the moſt diſtinguiſhed branches of this family was Peter, the ſubject of the preſent article. Louis XI.&nbsp;rewarded his bravery with the ſtaff of marſhal of France&nbsp;in 1473. He was one of the four lords who governed&nbsp;the kingdom during the indiſpoſition of that prince&nbsp;at Chinon in 1484. Two years afterwards he oppo- ,&nbsp;ſed the attacks of the archduke of Auſtria upon Picardy. He commanded the van-guard at the battle of&nbsp;Fornoue in i495y and ſignalized himſelf much in that&nbsp;engagement. His bravery procured him the countenance and confidence of Louis XII. who appointed&nbsp;him his prime counſellor, and general of the army in&nbsp;Italy ; but theſe advantages he loſt, by incurring the&nbsp;diſpleaſure of Anne of Brittany the queen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The marſhal had flopped ſome of her equipage on the road to Nantz ; for which that vindictive princeſs&nbsp;prevailed on her huſhand to enter into a proceſs againſt&nbsp;him before the parliament of Toulouſe, at that time&nbsp;the moſt rigorous and ſevere in the kingdom. He was&nbsp;on the 15tl1 of February 1506 found guilty, baniſhed&nbsp;ſrom the court, and deprived of the privileges and emoluments of his office for five years. The expence of&nbsp;this proſecution amounted to more than 31,000 livres,&nbsp;and it did no honour either to the king or the queen.&nbsp;If indeed it be true, that the queen was never ſo much&nbsp;delighted as with the humiliation of her enemies, ſhe&nbsp;had good reaſon to be ſatisfied here. John of Authon,&nbsp;who hath entered into a pretty full detail of this affair,&nbsp;reports that Gié, being removed to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chateau de&nbsp;Dreux,</span><span class="font0"> became an object of ridicule to the witneſſes who&nbsp;had ſworn againſt him. He wore a long white beard,&nbsp;and, quite full of the thoughts of his diſgrace, took it&nbsp;on one occaſion in his hands and covered his face with&nbsp;it. An ape, belonging to Alain d’Albret, count of&nbsp;Dreux, jumped from a bed where his maſter was re-poſing himſelf, and attacked the beard of Gié, who,&nbsp;with ſome difficulty, extricated himſelf. This ſeene&nbsp;not only occaſioned much laughter to the whole company who were preſent, but likewiſe became inſtantly&nbsp;the ſubject of the farces and mummeries which were&nbsp;then acting in France. Even the ſchool-boys made a&nbsp;repreſentation of it, where, alluding to the name of the&nbsp;queen, they ſaid, that there was a marſhal who wiſhed&nbsp;to ſhoe an aſs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fun aηe},</span><span class="font0"> but that he received ſuch a&nbsp;blow with the foot, as threw him over the wall into the&nbsp;garden. Mateſehal de Gié died at Paris, the 22d A-pril ί ς 1 3, perfectly diſguſted with courts and grandeur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rohan (Henry duke of), peer of France, and prince of Leon, was born at the Chateau de Blein in Brittany in 1579. Henry IV. under whoſe eyes he gave&nbsp;diſtinguiſhed prooſs of his bravery at the ſiege of A-miens, when only 16 years of age, loved him with as&nbsp;much affection as if he had been his own ſon. After&nbsp;the death of Henry, he became chief of the Calviniſts</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
