It is not certainly known whether any of them are volcanic. Pumice stones are often seen floating on the Mississippi, and still oftener on the Missouri. These are generally of a reddish yellow, or flame colour, and are amongst the largest and finest specimens of this substance to be met with. Some assert that they proceed from hills of burning coal, but we never heard of hills of burning coal ever yielding such a product. They are entirely a volcanic production, and beyond doubt are either discharged from craters at present active, or are washed away by the mountain torrents, from places which were formerly the scene of such phenomena. Mica is also abundantly carried along by the waters which flow from the Rocky Mountains. The great rivers that are discharged from their eastern and western declivities wind among the mountains, the Arkansas on the east, and the Oregon or Columbia on the west, more than a hundred leagues before they issue into the plains. In following the beds of such streams, travellers passthrough the range without much difficulty, so that the reports of the early travellers that they presented a high, continuous, and almost impassable barrier, are incorrect. Various leaders of expeditions have passed them at different points, and affirm that they found no such formidable and insurmountable barriers, the mention of which was wont to deter traders from attempting to cross from east to west or from west to east by this route. Following the river Platt, which is one of the principal southern branches of the Missouri, the traveller finds a road even to Lake Buenaventura, on the Pacific plains, that needs little labour to adapt it to the passage of horses and waggons. The acclivity is nowhere so great as to exceed an ascent of three degrees.</p><p>This vast range has been divided into the Rocky, Chepy-wan, and Masserne Mountains, on what ground is not exactly kno¼<hi rend="sup">r</hi>n. The ranges on the south, at the sources of the Arkansas, and running thence towards the Gulf of Mexico, are called the Masserne Mountains. A single peak of this ridge, seen as a landmark for immense distances over the subjacent plains, is called Mount Pike, a very appropriate name. It is described as of incomparable grandeur in appearance, and has been differently estimated at from seven to ten thousand feet in height. On the ridges of the Rocky Mountains, the Colorado of the Pacific, the Rio del Norte of Mexico, the Roche-jaune or Yellow-stone of the Missouri, and the Arkansas and Red River of the Mississippi, streams which have outlets at such immense distances apart, all have their origin. Many accounts have been given of the appearance of silver and other metals in the Rocky Mountains, but they have been too partially explored to entitle us to pronounce on the extent or value of the veins.    (r. r. r.)</p><p>ROCROY, an arrondissement of France, in the department of the Ardennes, which extends over 482 square miles.

He was the descendant of an ancient family, and was related to the duke of Chandos. His father Henry Rodney obtained, at the age of fourteen, a commission as cornet of horse ; but having quitted the army after a short period of service, he settled at Walton-upon-Thames, and married Mary, eldest daughter and coheiress of Sir Henry Newton, envoy extraordinary to the grand duke of Tuscany, and afterwards judge of the court of admiralty. Through the interest of the duke, who usually attended the king on his journeys to and from Hanover, Mr Rodney obtained the command of the royal yacht ; and having on one of these occasions been asked what mark of favour he would wish the king to confer upon him, he requested that his majesty would stand sponsor for his son. Such a request was easily granted ; and accordingly his second son was named after his royal and noble godfathers.</p><p>At a very early age he was sent to Harrow school ; and having quitted it at the age of twelve, he received from the king a letter of service, the last ever granted, and went to sea On the Newfoundland station he served for six years with Admiral Medley. On the 15th of February 1739 he was made lieutenant in the Dolphin, by Admiral Haddock, in the Mediterranean, and served successively in the Essex, Royal Sovereign, and Namur. Admiral Mathews having in 1742 appointed him to the Plymouth of sixty-four guns, he convoyed three hundred sail of the Lisbon trade through the midst of the French fleet, then cruising in the channel ; and for his conduct on this occasion he received the warmest thanks of the merchants. In the rank of captain he was confirmed by the admiralty, and was appointed to the command of the Sheerness, in which he continued for eighteen months. He was then removed to the Ludlow Castle, of forty guns. In this ship he fought and took the great St Maloes privateer, of forty guns, and one hundred men above his own complement. From this period till December 1745, he was employed in various pieces of service, which afforded him no particular opportunities of obtaining distinction. Having been appointed to the Centurion, he for two years cruised in the North Sea ; and on that station he commanded while the pretender was in Edinburgh, and until the arrival of Admiral Byng. He was now promoted to the command of the Eagle, of sixty-four guns; and in 1747 he was despatched in a small squadron for the purpose of intercepting the French fleet, llomeward-bound from St Domingo. On the 20th of June they fell in with this fleet off Cape Ortegal. The French men-of-war deserted their convoy during the night, and no fewer than forty-eight merchantmen were captured. Rodney afterwards joined the squadron of Admiral Hawke, and bore a distinguished part in the action off Finisterre on the 14th of October in the same year. Near the close of this war, a small squadron, of which the Eagle was one, fell in with a Spanish fleet from the West Indies, consisting of twelve sail of the line with a rich convoy, and, notwithstanding their own inferiority, they took from them six sail of merchantmen.</p><p>Captain Rodney was appointed to the Rainbow in March 1748, and was soon afterwards sent as governor and commander-in-chief on the Newfoundland station. This was his first appearance with the rank of commodore. He had received particular instructions to discover, if possible, an island in the Western Ocean, said to be in lat. 49. N., about three hundred leagues from Britain. After cruising fourteen days to no purpose, he sailed for St John’s, the seat of his government. In this station he continued till the month of October 1752, when he returned home to take his seat in parliament, having been elected for the borough of Saltash.</p><p>In May 1757 he sailed in the Dublin, of seventy-four guns, with Hawke’s expedition for the bombardment of</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
