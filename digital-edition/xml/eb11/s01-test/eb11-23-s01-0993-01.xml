the extreme north-east frontier station of British India, in the Lakhimpur district of Eastern Bengal and Assam. It stands high on a grassy plain, nearly surrounded by forest-clad mountains, on the right bank of what is locally (but errone-ously) considered the main stream of the Brahmaputra. On the opposite bank a railway has recently been opened which connects with the Assam-Bengal line. Sadiya is garrisoned by detachments of native infantry and military police, and is the base of a chain of outposts. There is a bazaar, to which the hill-men beyond the frontier—Mishmis, Abors and Khamtis—bring down rubber, wax, ivory and musk, to barter for cotton-cloth, salt, metal goods, &amp;amp;c.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
