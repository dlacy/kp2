<p><span class="font1">like Condé was content to draw aside the curtains for him to pass, and to sue for the hand of Richelieu’s niece for his son,&nbsp;the “ Great Condé.” His pride and ambition were gratified&nbsp;by the foundation of a sort of dynasty of his nephews and&nbsp;nieces, whose hands were sought by the noblest in the realm.&nbsp;Like all statesmen of his time, Richelieu made money out of&nbsp;politics. He came to court in 1617 with an income of 25,000&nbsp;livres from his ecclesiastical benefices. In the later years of&nbsp;his life it exceeded 3,000,000 livres. He lived in imperial&nbsp;state, building himself the great Palais CardinaI, now the&nbsp;Palais Royal, in Paris, another at Rueil near Paris, and re-building his ancestral château in Poitou. His table cost him&nbsp;a thousand crowns a day, aIthough he himself lived simply.&nbsp;He celebrated his triumphs to the full with gorgeous fêtes in&nbsp;his palace, especially with lavish theatrical representations.&nbsp;In January 1641 the tragedy of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mirame,</span><span class="font1"> said to have been his&nbsp;own, was produced with great magnificence. Richelieu was&nbsp;anxious for literary fame, and his writings are not unworthy&nbsp;of him. But more important than his own efforts as an author&nbsp;were his protection and patronage of literary men, especially&nbsp;of Corneille, and his creation of the French Academy in 1635.&nbsp;His influence upon French literature was considerable and&nbsp;lasting. Hardly less important was his rebuilding of the&nbsp;Sorbonne and his endowments there. When he died, on the&nbsp;4th of December 1642, he was buried in the chapel of the&nbsp;Sorbonne, which still stands as he built it. His tomb, erected&nbsp;in 1694, though rifled at the Revolution, still exists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many writings are attributed to Richelieu, although owing to his habit of working with substitutes and assistants it is difficult to&nbsp;settle how much of what passes under his name is authentic. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les&nbsp;Thuileries, La Grande Pastorale, Mirame,</span><span class="font1"> and the other plays, over&nbsp;whose fate he trembled as over the result of an embassy or a campaign, have long been forgotten; but a permanent interest attaches&nbsp;to his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires</span><span class="font1"> and correspondence: </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoire d’Armand du Plessis&nbsp;de Richelieu, évêque de Luçon, écrit de sa main, l’année ιόογ ou 1610,&nbsp;alors qu’il méditait de paraître à la cour,</span><span class="font1"> edited by Armand Baschet&nbsp;(1880); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la mère et du fils (i.e.</span><span class="font1"> of Marie de Medici and&nbsp;Louis XIII.), sometimes attributed to Mézeray, published at Amsterdam in 1730 and, under the title </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la régence de reine&nbsp;Marie de Médicis, femme de Henry IV.,</span><span class="font1"> at the Hague in 1743;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires sur la règne de Louis XIII.,</span><span class="font1"> extending from 1610 to 1638,&nbsp;and of which the earlier portion is a reprint of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la&nbsp;mère et du fils,</span><span class="font1"> published in PetitoFs collection (Paris, 1823 seq.) ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testament politique d’Armand du Plessis, cardinal de Richelieu&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Amsterdam, 1687 seq ) ; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Journal de 1630-31</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1645) ; “ Lettres,&nbsp;instructions diplomatiques, et papiers d’état,” published by G.&nbsp;d’Avenel in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Coll, de doc. inéd.</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1853-77); and “ Maximes&nbsp;d’état et fragments politiques,” published by G.

<p><span class="font1">Duc </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">de</span><span class="font1"> (1696-1788), marshal of France, was </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">grandnephew of Cardinal Richelieu, and was bom in Paris on the 13th of&nbsp;March 1696. Apart from his reputation as a man of exceptionally loose morals, he attained, in spite of a deplorably defective education, distinction as a diplomatist and general.&nbsp;As ambassador to Vienna (1725-29) he settled in 1727 the&nbsp;preliminaries of peace; in 1733-34 he served in the Rhine&nbsp;campaign. His real public career began ten years later. He&nbsp;fought with distinction at Dettingen and Fontenoy, where&nbsp;he directed the grapeshot upon the English columns, and&nbsp;three years afterwards he made a brilliant defence of Genoa;&nbsp;in 1756 he expelled the English from Minorca by the capture&nbsp;of the San Felipe fortress; and in 1757-58 he closed his&nbsp;military career by those pillaging campaigns in Hanover&nbsp;which procured him the sobriquet of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petit Père de la Maraude.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">After the wars he plunged again into court intrigue, favoured&nbsp;the comtesse du Barry and supported his nephew the duc&nbsp;d’Aiguilon. Louis XVI., however, was not favourably inclined&nbsp;to him. In his early days he was thrice imprisoned in the&nbsp;Bastille: in 1711 at the instance of his stepfather, in 1716 in&nbsp;consequence of a duel, and in 1719 for his share in AIberonis&nbsp;conspiracy against the regent Orleans. He was thrice married:&nbsp;first, against his will, at the age of fourteen to Anne Catherine&nbsp;de Noailles; secondly, in 1734, by the intrigues (according to&nbsp;the witty Frenchman’s own account) of Voltaire, to Marie&nbsp;Elisabeth Sophie, Mademoiselle de Guise; and thirdly, when&nbsp;he was eighty-four years old, to an Irish lady. He died in&nbsp;Paris on the 8th of August 1788. Marshal Richelieu’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">published by J. L.
