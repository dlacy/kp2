<p><span class="font0">RHODES, the most easterly of the islands of the Aegean Sea, about 10 m. S. of Cape Alypo in Asia Minor. It forms,&nbsp;with the islands of Syme, Casos, Carpathos, Castelorizo, Telos&nbsp;and Charki, one of the four sanjaks into which the Archipelago&nbsp;vilayet of Turkey is divided. The governor-general of the&nbsp;vilayet Tesides at the town of Rhodes. The length of the&nbsp;island is about 45 m. from N.E. to S.W., its greatest breadth&nbsp;22 m., and its area nearly 424 sq. m? The population of the&nbsp;island comprises 7000 Moslems, 21,000 Christians, and 2000&nbsp;Jews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The island is diversified in its surface, and is traversed from north to sbuth by an elevated mountain range, the highest&nbsp;point of which is called Atairo (anc. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Atabyris</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Atabyrium)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(4560 ft.). It commands a view of the elevated coast of Asia&nbsp;Minor towards the north, and of the Archipelago, studded&nbsp;with its numerous islands, on the north-west; while on the&nbsp;south-west is seen Mount Ida in Crete, often veiled in clouds,&nbsp;and on the south and south-east the vast expanse of waters&nbsp;which wash the African shore. The rest of the island is&nbsp;occupied in great part by ranges of moderately elevated hills,&nbsp;on which are found extensive woods of ancient pines, planted&nbsp;by the hand of nature. These forests were formerly very&nbsp;thick, but they are now greatly thinned by the Turks, who&nbsp;cut them down and take no care to plant others in their place.&nbsp;Beneath these hills the surface of the island falls lower, and&nbsp;several hills in the form of amphitheatres extend their bases&nbsp;as far as the sea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhodes was famed in ancient times for its delightful climate, and it still maintains its former reputation. The winds are&nbsp;liable to IittIe variation; they blow from the west, often with&nbsp;great violence, for nine months in the year, and at other times&nbsp;from the nqrth; and they moderate the summer heats, which&nbsp;are chiefly felt during the months of July and August, when&nbsp;the hot winds blow from the coast of Anatolia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhodes, in addition to its fine climate, is blessed with a fertile soil, and produces a variety of the finest fruits and&nbsp;vegetables. Around the villages are extensive cultivated&nbsp;fields and orchards, containing fig, pomegranate and orange&nbsp;trees. On the sloping hills carob trees, and others both useful&nbsp;and agreeable, still grow abundantly; the vine also holds its&nbsp;place, and| produces a species of wine which was highly valued&nbsp;by the ancients, though it seems to have degenerated greatly&nbsp;in modern times. The valleys afford rich pastures, and the&nbsp;plains produce every species of grain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The commerce of the island has been of late years increasing at a rapid rate. Many British manufactures are imported&nbsp;by indirect routes, through Smyrna, Constantinople, Beyrout&nbsp;and other places. Cotton stuffs, calicoes and grey linen are&nbsp;among the goods most in demand; they are exported to the&nbsp;neighbouring coast of Anatolia, between Budrum and Adalia,&nbsp;and thence conveyed into the interior. The expansion of&nbsp;the trade has been very much owing to the establishment of&nbsp;steam navigation direct to the island, which is now visited&nbsp;regularly by French and Austrian steamers, as welI as by some&nbsp;from England to Symma.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The only town of any importance in the island is the capital, Rhodes, which stands at the north-cast extremity. It rises in&nbsp;an imposing manner from the sea, on a gentle slope in the form&nbsp;of an amphitheatre. It is surrounded with walls and towers,&nbsp;and defended by a large moated castle of great strength. These&nbsp;fortifications are all the work of the Knights of St John. The&nbsp;interior of the, city does not correspond to its outward appearance. No trace exists of the splendour of the ancient city,&nbsp;with its regular streets, well-ordered plan and numerous&nbsp;public buildings. The modern city of Rhodes is in general&nbsp;the work of the Knights of St John, and has altogether a&nbsp;medieval aspect. The picturesque fortifications also by&nbsp;which the city is surrounded remain almost unaltered as they&nbsp;were in the 15th century. The principal buildings which&nbsp;remain are the church of St John, which is become the principaI&nbsp;mosque; the hospital, which has been transformed into public&nbsp;granaries; the palace of the grand master, now the residence&nbsp;of the pasha; and the senate-house, which still contains some&nbsp;marbles and ancient columns. Of the streets, the best and&nbsp;widest is a long street which is still caIIed the Street of the&nbsp;Knights. It is perfectly straight, and formed of old houses,&nbsp;on which remain the armorial bearings of the members of the&nbsp;order. On some of these buildings are still seen the arms of&nbsp;the popes and of some of the royal and noble houses of Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The only relics of classical antiquity are the numerous inscribed altars and bases of statues, as well as architecturaI&nbsp;fragments, which are found scattered in the courtyards and&nbsp;gardens of the houses in the extensive suburbs which now&nbsp;surround the town, the whole of which were comprised within&nbsp;the limits of the ancient city. The foundations also of the&nbsp;moles that separate the harbours are of Hellenic work, though&nbsp;the existing moles were erected by the Knights of St John.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rhodes has two harbours. The lesser of these lies towards the east, and its entrance is obstructed by a barrier of rocks,&nbsp;so as to admit the entrance of but one ship at a time. It is&nbsp;Suflaciently sheltered, but by the negligence of (the Turks the&nbsp;sand has been suffered to accumulate until it has been graduaIly&nbsp;almost choked up. The other harbour is Iarger, and also in a&nbsp;bad condition; here small ships may anchor, and are sheltered&nbsp;from the west winds, though they are exposed to the north&nbsp;and north-east winds. The two harbours are separated by a&nbsp;mole which runs obliquely into the sea. At the eastern&nbsp;entrance is the fort of St Elmo, with a Ughthouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font0">It is as yet difficult to determine the part which Rhodes played in prehistoric days during the naval predominance&nbsp;of the neighbouring island of Crete; but archaeological remains&nbsp;dating from the later Mipoan age prove that the early Aegean&nbsp;culture maintained itself there comparatively unimpaired until&nbsp;the historic period. A similar conclusion may be drawn from&nbsp;the legend which peopled primitive Rhodes with a population&nbsp;of skilful workers in metal, the “ Telchines.” Whatever the&nbsp;jaciaI affinities of the early inhabitants may have been, it is&nbsp;certain that in historic times Rhodes was occupied by a Dorian&nbsp;population, reputed to have emigrated mainly from Argos&nbsp;subsequently to the “ Dorian invasion ” of Greece. The three&nbsp;cities founded by these settlers—Lindus, Ialysus and Camirus—&nbsp;belonged to the “ League of Six Cities,” by which the Dorian&nbsp;colonists in Asia Minor sought to protect themselves against&nbsp;the barbarians of the neighbouring mainland. The early history&nbsp;of these towns is a record of brisk commercial expansion and&nbsp;active colonization. The position of Rhodes as a distributing&nbsp;centre of Levantine and especially of Phoenician goods is well&nbsp;attested by archaeological finds. Its colonies extended not onIy&nbsp;eastward along the southern coast of Asia Minor, but also Unked&nbsp;up the island with^the westernmost parts of the Greek world.&nbsp;Among such settlements may be mentioned Phaselis in Lycia,&nbsp;perhaps also SoU in Cilicia, Salapia on the east ItaUan coast,&nbsp;Gela in Sicily, the Lipari islands, and Rhoda in north-east&nbsp;Spain. In home waters the Rhodians exercised political&nbsp;control over Carpathos and other islands.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
