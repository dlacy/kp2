<p><span class="font1">RAVI, a river of India, one of the “ Five Rivers ’’ of the Punjab. It rises in the Kulu subdivision of Kangra district,&nbsp;flows through Chamba state, and enters British territory again&nbsp;in Gurdaspur district. At Madhupur the head works of the&nbsp;Bari Doab canal draw off a large portion of its waters. Thence&nbsp;it flows through the plains of the Punjab, passing within a mile&nbsp;of Lahore, and finally falls into the Chenab after a course of&nbsp;about 450 m.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAVINE, a deep, narrow gorge, cleft or valley in a mountain, worn by the violent rush of water, whence the name, which&nbsp;comes through Fr. from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rapina,</span><span class="font1"> violent robbery or plunder&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(rapere,</span><span class="font1"> to seize). The doublet “ ravin ” or “ raven,” robbery,&nbsp;greed, has given place to the more learned form “rapine,’’ but&nbsp;is still seen in “ ravenous,’’ greedy, voracious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAWALPINDI, a town of British India, which gives its name to a district and a division in the Punjab. The town is&nbsp;situated on the north bank of the little river Leh, 1726 ft. above&nbsp;the sea, 111 m. E. by S. of Peshawar, and 1443 m. N.W. of&nbsp;Calcutta. Pop. (1901) 87,688. It is chiefly notable as the&nbsp;largest military station, in India, and the key to the British&nbsp;system of defence upon the North-West Frontier. Railways&nbsp;radiate to Peshawar, Kohat, and the Malakand Pass, and a&nbsp;road runs to the Abbotabad frontier. It is also the starting-point of the cart-road to the hill-station of Murree and of the&nbsp;route into Kashmir. It is protected by a strong chain of forts,&nbsp;connected by the Circular Road. It is the headquarters of the&nbsp;second division of the northern army with a strong force of all&nbsp;arms, and contains an arsenal. Besides the locomotive works&nbsp;of the North-Western railway, there are gas-works, a tent&nbsp;factory, an iron foundry, and a brewery. An annual horse&nbsp;fair is held in April.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The District of Rawalpindi has an area of 2010 sq. m., Attock having been separated from it and formed into a separate&nbsp;district in 1904. It is situated on the southern slopes of the&nbsp;north-western extremities of the Himalayas, including large&nbsp;mountain tracts with rich valleys traversed by mountain&nbsp;torrents. It contains the Murree hills with the sanatorium of&nbsp;that name, the chief hill-station in the Punjab. The Indus&nbsp;and the Jhelum are the chief rivers, and the climate is noted&nbsp;for its healthiness. The principal crops are wheat, barley,&nbsp;maize, millets, and pulses. The district is traversed by the&nbsp;main line of the North-Western railway, crossing the Indus at&nbsp;Attock, and also by a branch towards the Indus at Kushalgarh.&nbsp;The population in 1901 was 558,699, showing an increase of&nbsp;4∙7% in the decade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Division of Rawalpindi lies in the north-west of the Punjab. It consists of the five districts of Gujrat, Attock,&nbsp;Shahpur, Jhelum, and Rawalpindi. The total area is 15,736&nbsp;sq. m. and the population in 1901 was 2,799,360.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RĀWENDIS, a Persian sect that took its name from a town Rāwend near Isfahan. Its origin is unknown, but they held&nbsp;ultra-Shiite doctrines (see Shiites). Under the year 158&nbsp;(a.d. 775) Tabarī says that a man of the Rāwendis, called al-Ablaq&nbsp;(because he was leprous), asserted that the spirit that was in&nbsp;Jesus was in 'Ali, then in the imāms one after the other to&nbsp;Ibrahīm ibn Maḥommed, and that thus these were gods. Asad&nbsp;ibn ‘Abdallah, then governor of Khorasan, put many of them to death. Under the year 135 (a.d. 752-3) the historian again&nbsp;mentions a rising of the Rāwendis of Talaqān, and its suppression.&nbsp;Under 141 (a.d. 758-9) he gives a fuller account of them. They&nbsp;believed in metempsychosis, or the transmigration of souls, and&nbsp;asserted that the spirit of Adam was in Othman ibn Nāhik, that&nbsp;the Lord who fed them and gave them drink was Abu Ja‛far&nbsp;ul-Manṣūr, and that al-Haitham ibn Moawiyā was Gabriel.&nbsp;Accordingly they came to the palace of Manṣūr in Hashimīya&nbsp;and began to hail him as Lord. Manṣūr, however, secured their&nbsp;chiefs and threw them into prison. By means of a mock&nbsp;funeral they succeeded in reaching the prison and delivering&nbsp;their leaders. They then turned in wrath against Manṣūr and&nbsp;almost succeeded in capturing him, but were defeated and&nbsp;slain by al-Haitham.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G. W. T.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAWITSCH (Polish </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ravicz),</span><span class="font1"> a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Posen, lying near the Silesian frontier,&nbsp;37 m. N. of Breslau, at the junction of railways to Posen and&nbsp;Liegnitz. Pop. (1905) 11</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">,</span><span class="font1">403. It contains a handsome Protestant church and a medieval town hall. The principal industry&nbsp;is the manufacture of snuff and cigars, and for the former it&nbsp;enjoys a considerable reputation. Trade is carried on in grain,&nbsp;wool, cattle, hides, and timber. Rawitsch was founded by&nbsp;Protestant refugees from Silesia during the Thirty Years’&nbsp;War. It passed to Prussia at the second partition of Poland&nbsp;in 1793.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAWLINSON, GEORGE (1812-1902), English scholar and historian, was born at Chadlington, Oxfordshire, on the 23rd&nbsp;November 1812, being the younger brother of Sir Henry&nbsp;Rawlinson </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.υ.).</span><span class="font1"> Having taken his degree at Oxford (from&nbsp;Trinity College) in 1838, he was elected to a fellowship at Exeter&nbsp;College in 1840, of which from 1842 to 1846 he was fellow and&nbsp;tutor. He was ordained in 1841; was Bampton lecturer in&nbsp;1859, and Camden professor of ancient history from 1861 to&nbsp;1889. In 1872 he was appointed canon of Canterbury, and&nbsp;after 1888 he was rector of All Hallows, Lombard Street. In&nbsp;1873 he was appointed proctor in Convocation for the Chapter&nbsp;of Canterbury. He married Louisa, daughter of Sir R. A.&nbsp;Chermside, in 1846.

<p><span class="font1">RAWLINSON, SIR HENRY CRESWICKE (1810-1895), English soldier and orientalist, was born at Chadlington, Oxfordshire, on the 11th of April 1810. In 1827 he went to India as&nbsp;cadet under the East India Company; and after six years’ life&nbsp;with his regiment as subaltern, during which time he had&nbsp;become proficient in the Persian language, he was sent to Persia&nbsp;in company with some other English officers to drill and&nbsp;reorganize the Shah’s troops. It was at this time that he was&nbsp;first attracted to the study of inscriptions, more particularly&nbsp;those in the hitherto undeciphered cuneiform character. In&nbsp;the course of the two years during which he was in its immediate&nbsp;neighbourhood he transcribed as much as he was able of the&nbsp;great cuneiform inscription at Behistun </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1">; but the friction&nbsp;between the Persian court and the British government ended in&nbsp;the departure of the British officers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He was appointed political agent at Kandahar in 1840. In that capacity he served for three years, his political labours&nbsp;being as meritorious as was his gallantry during various engagements in the course of the Afghan War; for these he was rewarded&nbsp;by the distinction of C.B. in 1844.
