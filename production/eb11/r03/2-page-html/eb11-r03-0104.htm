<p><span class="font0">disk-shaped rammers, and afterwards smoothed with irons heated to a dull redness. The original rock is thus, as it were,&nbsp;reconstructed by taking advantage of the power of coherence&nbsp;of the molecules under pressure when hot. In heating the&nbsp;powder the moisture combined in the limestone must be driven&nbsp;off without reducing the proportion of the bitumen more than&nbsp;is unavoidable. The powder cools very slowly, and may be&nbsp;conveyed long distances from the ovens; it may even be kept&nbsp;till the next day before use. When laid it should still retain&nbsp;a temperature of from 150° to 200°. It is spread evenly with&nbsp;a rake by skilled workmen for the whole width of the street&nbsp;to a thickness about two-fifths greater than the finished coating&nbsp;is intended to be. Ramming is commenced with light blows&nbsp;to ensure equality of compression throughout, and is continued&nbsp;with increased force until the whole is solidified. The ramming&nbsp;follows up the spreading, so that a joint is required only when&nbsp;the work is interrupted at the end of a day, or from some other&nbsp;cause. In a few hours after it has been laid an asphalt pavement may be used for traffic. When finished, its thickness&nbsp;may be from ij to 2| in., according to the traffic; a greater&nbsp;thickness than the latter cannot be evenly compressed with&nbsp;certainty. The asphalt loses thickness by compression under&nbsp;the traffic for a long time and to the extent, it is said, of one-fifth or one-fourth, but the wear appears to be very small.&nbsp;The wear-resisting power of the asphalt is due to its elasticity;&nbsp;tracks are made by the wheels at first, hut when thoroughly&nbsp;compressed by the traffic the surface retains little or no trace&nbsp;of the heaviest loads. Repairs are easily and quickly made by&nbsp;cutting out defective places and ramming in fresh heated&nbsp;powder, which can be done in the early morning without&nbsp;stopping the traffic. An unyielding foundation is indispensable;&nbsp;it should be of the best Portland cement concrete, 6 in. in&nbsp;thickness, which must be well set and perfectly dry throughout&nbsp;before the asphalt is laid, or the steam generated on the&nbsp;application of the hot powder will prevent coherence and lead&nbsp;to cracks and holes in the asphalt, which quickly enlarge under&nbsp;the traffic. For the same reason the asphalt should be laid&nbsp;in dry weather. The concrete foundation must be carefully&nbsp;formed to the proper profile, with an inclination towards the&nbsp;sides of not more than 1 in 50, which is sufficient with so&nbsp;smooth a surface. About 1 in 50 is the steepest gradient at&nbsp;which an asphalt pavement can be safely laid. When either&nbsp;dry or wet it affords good foothold for horses, but when&nbsp;beginning to get wet, or drying, it is often extremely slippery.&nbsp;This is said to be due to dirt on the surface, and not to the&nbsp;nature of the material. Sand is strewed over the surface to&nbsp;remcdy the slipperiness; it tends, however, to wear out the&nbsp;asphalt, and great cleanliness is the best preventive. An&nbsp;asphalt pavement can be kept cleaner than any other, is&nbsp;impervious to moisture, and dries quickly. While the road&nbsp;is kept clean, a very slight depression is made by the horseshoe, which for foothold is a great advantage. The noise&nbsp;made on asphalt by horse-traffic is about the same as that&nbsp;made on hard wood, and is not much more than is necessary&nbsp;for the safety of foot-passengers. In American cities asphalt&nbsp;has been adopted in a totally different form. AU asphalt&nbsp;pavements are composed of a very large proportion, perhaps&nbsp;five parts in six, of a hard non-bituminous material. In&nbsp;America it is found cheaper to get the purer bitumen of the&nbsp;island of Trinidad, and to procure in the localities the bulky&nbsp;material required for admixture—a coarse angular sand with a&nbsp;little pure carbonate of lime. An asphaltic cement is made&nbsp;from refined asphaltum. Of this, from 12 to 15% is used&nbsp;with 70 to 80% of sand and 5 to 15% of limestone dust.&nbsp;These materials are heated and stirred together into a stiff&nbsp;mastic paste to form the wearing surface of the road. Upon&nbsp;the concrete foundation is first spread a layer of fine bituminous&nbsp;concrete called '“ binder, ” 1 j in. thick, to unite the wearing&nbsp;surface to the concrete foundation. Upon the binder the&nbsp;asphalt is laid to a thickness of 2 in., being spread with iron&nbsp;rakes and brought to its finished surface by the steam roller.&nbsp;Obviously this is a process requiring great judgment and&nbsp;experience; but the system has become established in America,&nbsp;to the exclusion of European methods. Its great recommendation is the freedom from slipperiness that is said to result&nbsp;from the admixture of sharp sand, and this freedom is really&nbsp;the one quality in which asphalt pavement is seriously deficient.&nbsp;This system has been introduced into England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wood-Paving.—</span><span class="font0">Wood pavements were introduced in England in 1839. Hexagonal blocks of fir, 6 to 8 in. across and 4 to 6&nbsp;deep, were bedded in gravel laid on a foundation previously&nbsp;leveled and beaten. The blocks were either bevelled </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">off </span><span class="font0">at the&nbsp;edges or grooved across the face to afford foothold. Other wood&nbsp;pavements were tried in London about the same time, but they&nbsp;soon got out of order from unequal settlement of the blocks, and&nbsp;most of them lasted but a few years. The “ improved wood&nbsp;pavement” was first used in London in 1871. After the&nbsp;foundation was formed to the proper cross-section a bed of sand&nbsp;4 in. deep was laid, upon which came two layers of inch deal&nbsp;boards saturated with boiling tar, one layer across the other.&nbsp;The wooden blocks were 3 in. wide, 5 deep, and 9 long; they&nbsp;were dipped in tar and laid on the boards with the ends close&nbsp;together, but transversely the courses were spaced by fillets&nbsp;of wood three-fourths of an inch wide nailed to the floor and&nbsp;to the blocks. The joints were filled up with clean pebbles&nbsp;rammed in, and were run with a composition of pitch and tar,&nbsp;the surface being dressed with boiling tar and strewed with&nbsp;small sharp gravel and sand. In this pavement a somewhat&nbsp;elastic foundation was provided in the boards, which were also&nbsp;intended to prevent unequal settlement of the blocks; but the&nbsp;solidity of the pavement depended upon its water-tightness,&nbsp;for, when the surface water reached the sand, as it did sooner&nbsp;or later, settlement and dislocation of the blocks under the&nbsp;traffic arose. Pavements on this system were laid hetween&nbsp;1872 and 1876, and were kept in repair and relaid from time&nbsp;to time, but about 1877 the plank foundation was abandoned&nbsp;for a foundation of cement concrete, which is now generally&nbsp;employed. Australian hard woods have to a large extent&nbsp;supplanted the fir and pine which were at one time used as the&nbsp;materials for wood-paving. The softer woods, which afford&nbsp;reasonably good foothold and are comparatively noiseless,&nbsp;wear rapidly under heavy traffic, and are very liable to decay.&nbsp;Moreover, the wood actually used has been of mixed qualities,&nbsp;and when a block fails, those near it suffer; thus holes are&nbsp;formed, so that the pavement has to be renewed before its&nbsp;time. English oak and beech, which are perhaps too hard,&nbsp;have been used with varying results; but the Australian&nbsp;woods of the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eucalyptus</span><span class="font0"> have been most extensively&nbsp;tried, and with the most satisfactory results. Those which&nbsp;are best known are jarrah and kauri, but tallow wood, black-butt, blue-gum, red-gum, and spotted-gum, with others, have&nbsp;been tried. Of these, one or two are too dense and hard to&nbsp;afford foothold, others are not easily procured, but jarrah and&nbsp;kauri are used extensively. When cut from the matured&nbsp;heart-wood they are uniform in quality, hard enough for durability, and rough enough to afford fairly good foothold. A&nbsp;very large quantity of wood has been used in London under&nbsp;the name of American red-gum. In substance it comes between&nbsp;the soft and hard woods above mentioned. Wood blocks for&nbsp;paving must be cut with the utmost precision as to the depth&nbsp;of 5 or 6 in. and the breadth of 3 in. The usual length&nbsp;of 8 or 9 in. should also be kept well enough for bond. A&nbsp;long block is liable to tilt. As to depth, although a slight&nbsp;dcpression may be of little account, the least projection in a&nbsp;block will be immediately noted as a jolt by the swift-moving&nbsp;wheel. The laying and jointing of wood blocks on concrete&nbsp;is still a matter of experiment. They may be set on a half-inch&nbsp;bed of sand, which is supposed to, though it is doubtful whether&nbsp;it actually does, make the pavement elastic to the tread. If&nbsp;the blocks are not accurately gauged, the sand enables the&nbsp;paviour to adjust them to a uniform surface. But the practice&nbsp;most approved is to pave directly upon the smoothly finished&nbsp;concrete, trusting for elasticity to the wood. On the revival&nbsp;of wood-paving it was thought necessary, for foothold, to leave</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
