<p><span class="font0">state in the Assam plain, though it formerly had a wider range.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first rhinoceros seen alive in Europe since the time when these animals, in common with nearIy all the Iarge remarkabIe&nbsp;beasts of both Africa and Asia, were exhibited in the Roman&nbsp;shows, was of this species. It was sent from India to Emmanuel,&nbsp;king of PortugaI, in 1513; and from a sketch taken in Lisbon,&nbsp;Albert Dürer composed his celebrated but fanciful engraving,&nbsp;which was reproduced in so many oId books on natural history.&nbsp;This species chiefly frequents swampy grass jungle and is fond&nbsp;of a mud-bath. According to General A. H. Kinloch<sub>i</sub> it is&nbsp;hunted by “ tracking the animal on a single elephant until he&nbsp;is at last found in his lair, or perhaps standing quite unconscious</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">of danger; or by beating him out of the jungle with a line of elephants, the guns being stationed at the points where&nbsp;he is most likely to break cover. In the latter case it&nbsp;is necessary to have reliable men with the beaters, who can&nbsp;exercise authority and keep them in order, for both </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mahouts&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and eIephants have the greatest dread of the huge brute, who&nbsp;appears to be much more formidable than he really is.” The&nbsp;Javan rhinoceros </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Rhinoceros sondaicus)</span><span class="font0"> is distinguished by its&nbsp;smaller size, and a different arrangement of the skin-foIds (as&nbsp;may be seen by comparing figs. 1 and 2). The horn in the&nbsp;female is little developed, if not altogether absent. This species&nbsp;has a more extensive geographical range than the last, being&nbsp;found in the Bengal Sundarbans near Calcutta, Burma, the&nbsp;Malay Peninsula, Java, Sumatra and Borneo. The colour is&nbsp;uniform dusky grey. A femaIe obtained in the Sundarbans</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">stood 5 ft. 6 in. high. This species is more an inhabitant of tree-forest than of grass jungle, and its usual habitat appears&nbsp;to be in hilly countries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the second section there is a well-deveIoped nasal, and a small frontal horn separated by an interval. The skin is&nbsp;thrown into foIds, but these are not strongly marked, and lower&nbsp;tusks are present. This group or genus is represented at the&nbsp;present day only by the Sumatran rhinoceros, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhinoceros&nbsp;(Dicerorkinus) Sumatrensis,</span><span class="font0"> with its sub-species. It is the smallest&nbsp;of all the species, and its geographical range is nearly the same&nbsp;as that of the Javan species, though not extending into Java;&nbsp;it has been found in Assam, Chittagong, Burma, the Malay&nbsp;Peninsula, Sumatra and Borneo. The colour varies from earthy&nbsp;brown to bIackish, and the greater part of the body is thinly&nbsp;covered with hair, and the ears and tail are fringed. The average&nbsp;height of adults is from 4 ft. to 4 ft. 6 in. This species inhabits&nbsp;forests, and ascends hills to considerable elevations; it is shy&nbsp;and timid, but easily tamed even when adult. A specimen&nbsp;from Chittagong acquired in 1872 by the ZooIogical Society of&nbsp;London was named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">K Iasiotis,</span><span class="font0"> as it differed from the typical&nbsp;form by its larger size, paler and browner colour, smoother&nbsp;skin, longer, finer and redder hair, and the Iong fringe of hair&nbsp;on the ears. It is now recognized as a local race.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the third group or genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Diceros)</span><span class="font0"> beIong the two African rhinoceroses, which have two horns, the skin without definite&nbsp;foIds, and no lower tusks. The black rhinoceros </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Rhinoceros&nbsp;(Diceros) bicornis)</span><span class="font0"> is the smaller of the two, and has a pointed&nbsp;prehensile upper lip. It ranges through the wooded and&nbsp;watered districts of Africa, from Abyssinia in the north to the&nbsp;Cape Colony, but its numbers are yearly diminishing, owing to&nbsp;the opening up of the country. It feeds exclusively on leaves&nbsp;and branches of bushes and small trees, and chiefly frequents&nbsp;the sides of wood-clad rugged hills. Specimens in which the&nbsp;posterior horn has attained a length as great as or greater than&nbsp;the anterior have been separated under the name of R. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">keitloa,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">but the characters of these appendages are too variable for&nbsp;specific distinctions. The black rhinoceros is more rarely seen&nbsp;in menageries in Europe than either of the Asiatic species, but&nbsp;one lived in the gardens of the London Zoological Society from&nbsp;1868-1891.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lastly we have the white—BurchelTs, or square-mouthed— rhinoceros </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Rhinoceros (Diceros) simus),</span><span class="font0"> the largest of the five,&nbsp;and differing from the other species in having a square truncated&nbsp;upper lip. In conformity with the structure of the mouth,&nbsp;this species Uves entirely by browsing on grass, and is therefore&nbsp;more partial to open countries or districts where there are broad&nbsp;grassy valleys between the tracts of bush.
