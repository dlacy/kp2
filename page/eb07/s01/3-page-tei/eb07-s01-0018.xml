He was an episcopalian and a royalist from conviction ; and in all his discourses, public and private, he laboured to instil into the minds of others the principles which to himself appeared to have their foundation in truth. To persecution he was at all times an enemy, whilst he never tamely betrayed through fear what he thought it his duty to maintain. The consequence was, that in the end of the year 1688, he was treated by the rabble, which in the western counties of Scotland rose against the established church, with greater lenity than his more complying brethren.</p><p>Mr Sage retired to the metropolis, and carried with him the synodical book, which was afterwards demanded by the presbytery of Glasgow, but not recovered till, on the death of a nephew of Dr Rose, the last established bishop of Edinburgh, it was found in his possession, and restored to the presbytery to which it belonged. Mr Sage had detained it and given it to his friend, in the fond hope that episcopacy would soon be re-established in Scotland ; and it was doubtless with a view to contribute what he could to the realizing of that hope, that, immediately on his being obliged to leave Glasgow’, he commenced as a polemical writer. At Edinburgh he preached for a time, till, refusing to take the oaths of allegiance when required by the government, he was obliged to retire. Returning to Edinburgh in 1695, he was observed, and obliged to abscond. Yet he returned in 1696, when his friend Sir William Bruce was imprisoned as a suspected person.</p><p>After a time Mr Sage found a safe retreat with the Countess of Callendar, who employed him to instruct her family as chaplain, and her sons as tutor. These occupations did not wholly engage his active mind; for he employed his pen in defending his order or in exposing his oppressors. When the Countess of Callendar had no longer sons to instruct, Sage accepted the invitation of Sir John Stewart of Grandtully, who wanted the help of a chaplain and the conversation of a scholar. With Sir John he continued till the decency of his manners and the extensiveness of his learning recommended him to a higher station ; and, on the 25th of January 1705, he was consecrated a bishop by Paterson the archbishop of Glasgow, Rose the bishop of Edinburgh, and Douglas the bishop of Dumblane. But this promotion did not prevent him from falling into sickness in November 1706. After lingering for many months in Scotland, he tried the effect of the waters of Bath in 1709, without success. At Bath and at London he remained twelve months, recognised by the great and caressed by the learned. Yet though he was invited to stay, he returned in 1710 to his native country, and died at Edinburgh on the 7th of June 1711.</p><p>His works are, 1st.

It is called also Oku Jesso, or Upper Jesso, and by the natives Tchoka. It is separated from the continent by a narrow channel called the channel of Tartary; and it is not certainly known whether this channel extends along the whole western coast and forms Saghalien into an island, or whether it is connected with Tartary by an isthmus, thus making it a peninsula. The channel was entered by Pérouse with the idea of determining this question ; but he was obliged, by adverse winds and other circumstances, to quit it before examining its whole extent. The inhabitants assured him that it was an island separated from the continent only by a narrow strait. The people of Tartary, on the other hand, asserted that it was a peninsula connected with the continent by a narrow isthmus of sand, and covered with marine plants. In confirmation of the latter theory, Pérouse observed the depth of the water constantly to diminish, without any current being felt ; and he concluded that it was a strait, though so obstructed by sand and sea-weed as to be scarcely passable. Broughton, who penetrated twenty miles farther, and Krusenstern, observed that in the strait to the north of the river Saghalien the water is rendered almost fresh by the influx of the stream. The territory of Saghalien is mountainous, especially towards the centre. In the lower parts are wooded valleys and hills, and behind lofty mountains covered with snow ; towards the south the country becomes more level, and exhibits only hills of sand. Krusenstern, who sailed along the eastern coast, remarked that it was nearly destitute of inhabitants. The southern and western coasts are occupied by rude tribes, of whose dispositions, however, Pérouse gives a favourable account. They arc chiefly employed in hunting and in fishing. The north-east coast, opposite to the mouth of the Saghalien, is occupied by a colony of Mantchou Tartars. The Japanese had formed a colony in the Bay of Aniwa, at the southern extremity of the island ; but it has been destroyed by the Russians, who, it is supposed, intend to form establishments for themselves in those countries.</p><p>SAGITTA, in <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> the Arrow, a constellation of the northern hemisphere, near the Eagle, and one of the forty-eight old asterisms. According to the fabulous ideas of the Greeks, this constellation owes its origin to one of the arrows of Hercules, with which he killed the eagle or vulture that gnawed the liver of Prometheus. In the catalogues of Ptolemy, Tycho, and Hevelius, the stars of this constellation are only five in number, while Flamsteed made them amount to eighteen.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sagitta,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Geometry,</hi> a term used by some writers for the absciss of a curve.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sagitta,</hi> in <hi rend="italic">Trigonometry,</hi> the same as the versed sine of an arch, being so denominated because it is like a dart or arrow, standing on the chord of the arch.</p><p>SAGITTARIA, an island in the Southern Pacific Ocean, discovered by Quiros in 1606, and supposed to be the same as Otaheite.</p><p>SAGITTARIUS, in <hi rend="italic">Astronomy,</hi> the name of one of the twelve signs of the zodiac.</p><p>SAGO, a nutritive substance brought from the East Indies, and of considcrable use in diet as a restorative.
