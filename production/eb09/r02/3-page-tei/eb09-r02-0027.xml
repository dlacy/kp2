Rhynchoce-phalian genera continue in considerable variety, whilst other small-sized forms are referred to the Lacertilians. The types of Freshwater Turtles which lived in the Jurassic period pass into the Cretaceous. They appear now also in North-American strata : <hi rend="italic">Chelydifilæ</hi>  first, accompanied or immediately followed by <hi rend="italic">Ernydidx,</hi>  a few <hi rend="italic">Trionyx</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Chelonia,</hi>  and the remarkable <hi rend="italic">Protostega,</hi>  a precursor of <hi rend="italic">Sphargis.</hi>  Towards the end of the Cretaceous period its abundant Reptilian life is swept away, and not only every species but almost every Mesozoic genus disappears, a wide gap being left in our knowledge of the succession of Reptilian life between this period and the Tertiary era.</p><p>In the lowermost strata of Tertiary age a few isolated remains remind us still of the extinct Mesozoic fauna ; such are one or two genera allied to the Dinosaurians <hi rend="italic">(Agathαu-rnas)</hi>  from the Laramie beds of North America. In other respects the Tertiary Reptiles bear already the character of the present fauna ; although families or genera which are distinct from the living predominate in the Eocene, from the Miocene Reptiles gradually approach more and more the specific forms of our time. True Crocodiles (of which one species occurred already in the Cretaceous period), Gavials, Alligators have now entirely superseded the “ Mesosuchian ” type. The remains of Lacertilians are fragmentary and generally indistinct, so as to offer a wide field for generic distinctions. <hi rend="italic">Anguidæ</hi>  have been distinctly traced back to the Miocene of North America. With a single exception, that of a poisonous Serpent, apparently a <hi rend="italic">Vipera,</hi>  the remains of which have been found in Miocene deposits at Sansan (south of France), Snakes do not appear before the Eocene, in England as well as North America ; they are mostly large species, with uncertain affinities, but all innocuous <hi rend="italic">(Palævphis, Dinophis, Boctcus, Lithσphis).</hi>  Their remains are scarce, and even those of the later Tertiary formations show a greater resemblance to genera which are now-a-days locally far removed than to those living in the same geographical district. Chelonian remains are numerous throughout, probably on account of the resistance which their solid carapaces offered to destructive agencies. <hi rend="italic">Chelydidæ, Emydddæ,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Trwnycidæ</hi>  and also Marine Turtles continue to exist in an almost uninterrupted series, and approach so much the modern genera that, for instance, in <hi rend="italic">Trwnyχ,</hi>  if specific distinctions existed between Miocene and recent species, they cannot be determined in those parts of their skeleton which have been preserved. A peculiar type intermediate between the Marine Turtles and <hi rend="italic">Emys</hi>  existed in the English Eocene <hi rend="italic">(Chelone).</hi>  Land Tortoises, the most specialized type of the order, probably did not appear before the Miocene. A number of smaller forms are referable to the genus <hi rend="italic">Testudo,</hi>  but gigantic forms existed then as now in isolated localities, and exceeded in size the living, like the <hi rend="italic">Colossoehelys</hi>  of the Siwalik Hills, with a carapace computed to be 20 feet long, and the smaller <hi rend="italic">Macrochelys</hi>  from the German Molasse. It is extremely singular that the existence of these colossal Chelonians would seem to coincide with the period of the first appearance of the type of Land Tortoises.</p><p>Of the first appearance of most of the families of the recent fauna, and of their distribution in the Quaternary period,<hi rend="sup">1</hi> we know next to nothing. With few exceptions the Reptilian type had dwindled to forms of such small size that their remains, if preserved, escape observation or are too indistinct for determination.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">The Distribution of Existing Reptiles over the Earth’s Surface.</hi></p><p>Serious obstacles present themselves at the present time to a satisfactory treatment of the geographical distribution of Reptiles. We have mentioned at the end of the preceding section that the geological record is much too incomplete to permit a comparison to be drawn between their distribution in the present and next preceding periods, and that we are therefore ignorant as to the modes in which their dispersal was brought about, and unable to account otherwise than hypothetically for the numerous instances of apparently anomalous distribution. And, when we limit ourselves merely to the task of describing the facts of their distribution at the present day, it is necessary for such an attempt that the whole class should have previously undergone a thorough rearrangement in accordance with the present state of science, and that the scattered contributions to the various faunæ should have been critically examined and treated by the same uniform method. This is unfortunately not the case with the class of <hi rend="italic">Reptilia.</hi>  The systems and lists of <hi rend="italic">Lαcertiliα</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Ophidia </hi>which formed the bases for the treatises on the geographical distribution of these orders by Schlegel, Günther, and Wallace are buried under an accumulation of an immense number of additions of very different value, which require a uniform critical revision before they can be used in an inquiry of a general biological scope.<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p><p>In the following notes we have been able to include the majority of the genera of Chelonians and Ophidians, with an approximate estimate of the species of each that are known at present. As regards the former Strauch<hi rend="sup">3</hi> has done much to clear the way, although the small amount of materials known to him from autopsy interfered much with his critical judgment. Not many additions have been made to this order since the time of the publication of his memoirs. Of the numerous Ophidian genera and species we have eliminated all which are based on trivial distinctions, or are named by authors without special acquaintance with the subject. We have not entered into a full consideration of Lacertilian genera, as this would have been useless at a time when they are undergoing a revision, but have restricted ourselves to the families recently proposed by Boulenger.</p><p>One of the most important results obtained by this inquiry is that the same arrangement of the so-called primary zoological regions is not applicable to all orders of Reptiles, and that the differences in their distribution are so fundamental that they can be accounted for only on the assumption of the various orders and families having appeared and spread over the globe at very distant periods, when land and water were differently distributed over the surface of the globe. At the end of this section we shall show in a short résumé the mutual relations between the various regions with respect to the several orders of Reptiles.</p><p>The means of dispersal of Reptiles are very limited.</p><p><hi rend="sup">1</hi>    An important memoir on Indian Cheloηia is published whilst this article is passing through the press, “Siwalik and Narbada Chelσniafi by R.
