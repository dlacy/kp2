<p><span class="font0">half of the uro-proctodaeal fold, near which open the male ducts. Very young crocodiles possess a typical middle chamber&nbsp;or urodaeum, into the dorso-lateral corners of which open the&nbsp;ureters, but soon the strong circular fold between urodaeum&nbsp;and coprodaeum disappears completely, so that both chambers&nbsp;now form one large oval room, which is used solely for the&nbsp;storage of the urine, there being no bladder. The faeces are&nbsp;kept in the not specially dilated rectum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The cloacal arrangement of the Chelonia is a further development of early crocodilian conditions, but it has become rather complicated and shows a surprising resemblance to that which&nbsp;still prevails in the Monotremes. The proctodaeum is deep&nbsp;and very long, especially in the males. From its innermost&nbsp;and ventral walls arises the large copulatory organ. From the&nbsp;urodaeum is separated off a deep ventral recess into which open&nbsp;the ureters and the genital ducts, and it is continued by a long&nbsp;neck into the large bladder. Between the dorsal wall of this&nbsp;recess and the ventral wall of the main portion of the urodaeum&nbsp;arises a horizontal fold which, diverging, is continued on to the&nbsp;investing skin of the penis, helping to form the edges of the deep&nbsp;longitudinal furrow on its morphologically dorsal surface. If&nbsp;the lips of this furrow were closed, urine and all the genital&nbsp;products would pass through this urethral canal, but in reality&nbsp;only the semen is conducted through it (the furrow during the&nbsp;state of turgescence being transformed into a closed tube),&nbsp;whilst urine and eggs escape through the wide slit near its&nbsp;inner end. This is an arrangement almost the same as that&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orniihorhynchus.</span><span class="font0"> The urodaeum is separated from the&nbsp;rectum by a strong sphincter, and there is, as in the crocodiles&nbsp;and mammals, no special coprodaeum. The Chelonian urodaeum&nbsp;is further complicated by the occurrence of a pair of large anal&nbsp;sacs, thin-walled diverticula on the dorsal side. Such sacs,&nbsp;not to be confounded with the anal glands of other reptiles,&nbsp;exist in many water tortoises, especially in the Chelydidae,&nbsp;also in various aquatic Testudinidae, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. Emys<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font0">  in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Platyslernum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and sometimes in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx*,</span><span class="font0"> they are absent in the Chelonidae&nbsp;and in the typically terrestrial tortoises. These sacs have highly&nbsp;vascularized walls and a considerable layer of circular and&nbsp;longitudinal non-striped muscular'fibres; their inside is sometimes villous, never glandular. They are incessantly filled and&nbsp;emptied with water through the vent, and act as additional&nbsp;respiratory organs, like a kind of water lungs. When such a&nbsp;tortoise is suddenly taken out of the water it squirts out a&nbsp;stream of water, which is not, as is usually supposed, the urine&nbsp;from the bladder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In connexion with the cloaca may be mentioned the frequent occurrence of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peritoneal</span><span class="font0"> canals. In the tortoises their abdominal&nbsp;openings are situated in a recess of the peritoneal cavity close&nbsp;to either side of the neck of the bladder; in the females they&nbsp;extend as funnels, generally blind, into the cloaca on or near&nbsp;the base of the clitoris. In the males they extend, without&nbsp;having communication with the cavities of the corpora cavernosa,&nbsp;and without ramifications, as canals along the dorsum penis&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">either</span><span class="font0"> terminate blindly in the glans </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Testudo, Chelone),&nbsp;or</span><span class="font0"> they open, each by a small orifice, in the groove at the base of&nbsp;the glans. In crocodiles these canals are short and open near the&nbsp;base of the copulatory organ, protected by a small papilla. They&nbsp;are present in both sexes, but are still closed in newly hatched&nbsp;and very immature specimens. In an adult Nile crocodile they&nbsp;are wide enough to pass an ordinary lead pencil. The function&nbsp;of these outlets from the body cavity is obscure. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the writer has found them as closed funnels which project as&nbsp;soft papillae into the proctodaeum a little to the right and left&nbsp;and Caudalwards from the urino-genital papillae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Urinary Organs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kidneys</span><span class="font0"> of the reptiles show, like those of the birds and mammals, a considerable advance upon those of the&nbsp;Batrachia. They are, in the adult, represented entirely by the&nbsp;metanephros; the segmental tubes have no longer any nephro-stomes opening into the body cavity, not even during any&nbsp;time of their development, and it has come to a complete&nbsp;separation of the efferent genital ducts from the kidneys and&nbsp;from their ureters. Yet these differences are but of degree,&nbsp;there being a continuous bridge from Batrachian to Lacer-tilian conditions. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lacerta,</span><span class="font0"> for instance, in which these&nbsp;features have been studied most thoroughly, the mesonephros&nbsp;continues as the only functional excretory organ during the&nbsp;first year of the yöung creature until and during its first hibernation, when the formation of the metanephros takes place,&nbsp;and with it the complete separation of the vasa deferentia&nbsp;from tlie kidneys. Until then the segmental canals remain&nbsp;in the male as common carriers of semen and urine, at least&nbsp;morphologically, not physiologically, since in the immature&nbsp;there is no occasion for the conduction of semen. The kidneys&nbsp;of these young lizards show precisely the same arrangement&nbsp;as that of the Batrachia, excluding the Discoglossidae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Clearly the metanephros is developed from, and is part of, the posterior portion of the mesonephros, the glomeruli of which no&nbsp;longer open into the segmental duct, but become connected with&nbsp;a new canal, the future ureter, which sprouts from the distal&nbsp;portion of the segmental duct and grows headwards. Or let&nbsp;us put these important changes in another way. Since there are&nbsp;originally several segmental ducts (permanent in the male, newt)&nbsp;which tailwards more and more lose their connexion with the&nbsp;testes, until—in the posterior portion of the mesonephros—&nbsp;they become entirely urinary ducts, the hindmost of these&nbsp;sprouts (in lizards postembryonic, much earlier in birds and&nbsp;mammals) independently, but at the same time as the neighbouring mass of the mesonephros, the growing glomeruli of&nbsp;which then connect with the sprouting processes of the ureter.&nbsp;Phylogenetically and OntogeneticalIy it is evident enough that&nbsp;the kidneys are essentially one organ, the anterior portion of&nbsp;which is the oldest and decays, whilst farther backwards new&nbsp;and more differentiated portions continue to grow. Pro-, meso-and metanephros and successive wave-like stagey of the same&nbsp;organ with morphological and functional continuity, until the&nbsp;next, improved portion is ready. It is important that in the&nbsp;Discoglossidae, especially in the male </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alytes,</span><span class="font0"> an arrangement has&nbsp;come to pass which much resembles that of the Amniota. The&nbsp;mesonephros has, by a simple contrivance, become a metanephros, provided we define the former as a kidney which is still&nbsp;connected with true segmental ducts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">suprarenal bodies,</span><span class="font0"> adrenals, head-kidneys or Nebennieren, are yellowish bodies which lie more in connexion with the&nbsp;generative glands than with the kidneys, always closely attached&nbsp;to the vena cava posterior just above the kidneys. They are&nbsp;very elongated in the snakes, in a io-foot python they measure&nbsp;about one inch in length; they are flattened in tortoises, roundish&nbsp;in crocodiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In all reptiles the kidneys are retroperitoneal, and they do not project into the body cavity. Their position is different in the&nbsp;various groups, and their general shape is much affected by the&nbsp;shape of the body. In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia</span><span class="font0"> they are much elongated, and&nbsp;of course far in front of the pelvic region, which has been moved&nbsp;to the cloaca. They are placed asymmetrically, the right&nbsp;extending farthest forwards. They consist of many transverse&nbsp;lobes, sometimes in such a way as to appear spirally twisted.&nbsp;Each terminates considerably in front of the cloaca. Each&nbsp;ureter begins at the anterior end of the kidney, and thence&nbsp;proceeds on its inner and dorsal border, receiving ducts from the&nbsp;interspaces of the numerous lobes. In the male each ureter&nbsp;opens upon a papilla, together with the vas deferens; in the&nbsp;female the ureter is joined by a blind canal, the vestige of the&nbsp;male duct. No snake has a urinary bladder. The urinary&nbsp;excretion is white, chalky, consisting mainly of uric acid in&nbsp;crystals, with very little fluid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia</span><span class="font0"> the kidneys are more posteriorly placed than in snakes. They lie between the pelvis and the cloaca and are&nbsp;generally close together, sometimes partly fused with each other.&nbsp;Only in the Amphisbaenids the right kidney extends more&nbsp;forwards. They are usually transversely furrowed. The&nbsp;ureters open dorso-iaterally into the urodaeum upon papillae as&nbsp;in the snakes. In the females the remnants of the segmental</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
