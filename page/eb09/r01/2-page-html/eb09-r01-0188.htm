<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(the amounts of his bills are in record), apparently without friends and thrown entirely on himself. But there was no&nbsp;failure here, for this dark year of 1656 stands out prominently as one in which some of his greatest works were&nbsp;produced, as, for example, John the Baptist Preaching&nbsp;in the Wilderness, belonging to Lord Dudley, and Jacob&nbsp;Blessing the Sons of Joseph, of the Cassel Gallery. It&nbsp;is impossible not to respect the man who, amid the utter&nbsp;ruin of his affairs, could calmly conceive and carry out&nbsp;such noble work. Yet even in his art one can see that the&nbsp;tone of his mind was sombre. Instead of the brilliancy&nbsp;of 1654 we have for two or three years a preference for&nbsp;dull yellows, reds, and greys, with a certain measure of&nbsp;uniformity of tone. The handling is broad and rapid,&nbsp;as if to give utterance to the ideas which crowded on his&nbsp;mind. There is less caressing of colour for its own sake,&nbsp;even less straining after vigorous effect of light and shade.&nbsp;Still the two pictures just named are among the greatest&nbsp;works of the master. To the same year belongs the&nbsp;Lesson in Anatomy of Johann Deyman, another of the&nbsp;many men of science with whom Bembrandt was closely&nbsp;associated. The subject is similar to the great Tulp of&nbsp;1632, but his manner and power of colour had advanced&nbsp;so much that Sir Joshua Reynolds, in his visit to Holland&nbsp;in 1781, was reminded by it of Michelangelo and Titian.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Vosmaer ascribes to the same year, though Bode places it&nbsp;later, the famous portrait of Jan Six, the future burgomaster, consummate in its ease and character, as Six&nbsp;descends the steps of his house drawing on his glove.&nbsp;The connexion between Rembrandt and the great family&nbsp;of Six was long and close, and is honourable to both.&nbsp;Jan married a daughter of Tulp the anatomist, one of&nbsp;Rembrandt’s earliest friends. In 1641 the mother of Six,&nbsp;Anna Wymer, had been painted with consummate skill by&nbsp;Rembrandt, who also executed in 1647 the beautiful&nbsp;etching of Six standing by a window reading his tragedy&nbsp;of “ Medea,” afterwards illustrated by his friend. Now&nbsp;he paints his portrait in the prime of manhood, and in the&nbsp;same year of gloom paints for him the masterly John the&nbsp;Baptist. Six, if he could not avert the disaster of&nbsp;Rembrandt’s life, at least stood by him in the darkest&nbsp;hour, when certainly the creative energy of Rembrandt&nbsp;was in full play. The same period gives us the Master&nbsp;of the Vineyard, and the Adoration of the Magi of Buckingham Palace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">After the sale of the house in the Breedstraat Rembrandt retired to the Rosengracht, an obscure quarter at the west&nbsp;end of the city. Vosmaer thinks he has traced the very&nbsp;house, but some doubts have been thrown on this discovery by De Roever. We are now drawing to the splendid&nbsp;close of his career in his third manner, in which his touch&nbsp;became broader, his impasto more solid, and his knowledge&nbsp;more complete. Hastening on by quicker steps, we may&nbsp;mention the Old Man with the Grey Beard of the National&nbsp;Gallery (1657), and the Bruyningh, the Secretary of the&nbsp;Insolvents’ Chamber, of Cassel (1658), both leading&nbsp;up to the great portraits of the Syndics of the Cloth&nbsp;Hall of 1661. Nearly thirty years separate us from the&nbsp;Lesson in Anatomy, years of long-continued observation&nbsp;and labour. The knowledge thus gathered, the problems&nbsp;solved, the mastery attained, are shown here in abundance.&nbsp;Rembrandt returns to the simplest gamut of colour, but&nbsp;shows his skill in the use of it, leaving on the spectator an</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> This picture has had a strange history. It had suffered by fire and was sold to a Mr Chaplin of London in 1841, was exhibited in&nbsp;Leeds in 1868, and again disappeared, ultimately to be found in the&nbsp;magazines of the South Kensington Museum as a doubtful Rembrandt.&nbsp;The patriotism of some Dutch lovers of art restored it to its native&nbsp;country; and it now hangs, a magnificent fragment, in the Museum&nbsp;of Amsterdam.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">impression of absolute enjoyment of the result, unconscious of the means. The plain burghers dealing with the simple&nbsp;concerns of their guild arrest our attention as if they were&nbsp;the makers of history. They live for ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In his old age Rembrandt continued to paint his own portrait as assiduously as in his youthful and happy days.&nbsp;About twenty of these portraits are known, a typical one&nbsp;being found in the National Gallery. All show the same&nbsp;self reliant expression, though broken down indeed by age&nbsp;and the cares of a hard life. There is in Stockholm a large&nbsp;and unfinished picture which, if painted by Rembrandt,&nbsp;belongs to the late years of his life (etched by Waltner,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gaz. des Beaux-Arts</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, Nov. 1874). It is catalogued as the&nbsp;Oath of John Ziska, certainly a strange subject for Rembrandt. Bode accepts the more natural interpretation of&nbsp;Prof. Anton Springer, viz., the Feast of Judas Maccabæus,&nbsp;and ascribes the picture to an earlier date than that given&nbsp;by Vosmaer. Havard, however, after careful examination,&nbsp;attributes the work to Carel Fabritius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">About the year 1663 Rembrandt painted the (so-called) Jewish Bride of the Van der Hoop Gallery and the Family&nbsp;Group of Brunswick, the last and perhaps the most brilliant&nbsp;works of his life, bold and rapid in execution and marvellous in the subtle mixture and play of colours in which lie&nbsp;seems to revel. The woman and children are painted with&nbsp;such love that the impression is conveyed that they represent a fancy family group of the painter in his old age.&nbsp;This idea received some confirmation from the supposed discovery that he left a widow Catherine Van Wyck and two&nbsp;children, but this theory falls to the ground, for De&nbsp;Roever has shown </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Oud Holland,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1883) that Catherine was&nbsp;the widow of a marine painter Theunisz Blanckerhoff, who&nbsp;died about the same time as Rembrandt. The mistake&nbsp;arose from a miscopying of the register. The subject of&nbsp;these pictures is thus more mysterious than ever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In 1668 Titus, the only son of Rembrandt, died, leaving one child, and on 8th October 1669 the great painter himself passed away, leaving two children, and w<sup>r</sup>as buried in&nbsp;the Wester Kerk. He had outlived his popularity, for his&nbsp;manner of painting, as we know from contemporaries, ■was&nbsp;no longer in favour with a people who preferred the smooth&nbsp;trivialities of Van der Werff and the younger Mieris, the&nbsp;leaders of an expiring school.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">We must give but a short notice of Rembrandt’s achievements in etching. Here he stands out by universal confession as first,&nbsp;excelling all by his unrivalled technical skill, his mastery of&nbsp;expression, and the lofty conceptions of many of his great pieces,&nbsp;as in the Death of the Virgin, the Christ Preaching, the Christ&nbsp;Healing the Sick (the Hundred Guilder Print), the Presentation&nbsp;to the People, the Crucifixion, and others. So great is his skill&nbsp;simply as an etcher that one is apt to overlook the nobleness of the&nbsp;etcher’s ideas and the depth of his nature, and this tendency has&nbsp;been doubtless confirmed by the enormous difference in money&nbsp;value between “ states ” of the same })late, rarity giving in many&nbsp;cases a fictitious worth in the eyes of collectors. The points of&nbsp;difference between these states arise from the additions and changes&nbsp;made by Rembrandt on the plate. ; and the prints taken off by him&nbsp;have been subjected to the closest inspection by Bartsch, Gersaint,&nbsp;Wilson, Daulby, DeClaussin, C. Blanc, Willsliire, Seymour Haden,&nbsp;Middleton, and others, who have described them at great length and&nbsp;to whom the reader is referred. The classification of Rembrandt’s&nbsp;etchings adopted till lately was the artificial one of treating them&nbsp;according to the subject, as Biblical, portrait, landscape, and so on ;&nbsp;and to Vosmaer must bo ascribed the credit of being the first to&nbsp;view Rembrandt’s etched work, as he has done his work in painting,&nbsp;in the more scientific and intei’esting line of chronology. This&nbsp;method has been developed by Mr Seymour Haden and Mr&nbsp;Middleton, and is now universally accepted. But even so recently&nbsp;as 1873 M. C. Blanc, in his fine work </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">L'Œuvre complet clc Rembrandt,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">still adheres to the older and less intelligent arrangement, resting&nbsp;his preference on the frequent absence of dates on the etchings and&nbsp;more strangely still on the equality of the work. Mr Seymour&nbsp;Haden’s reply is conclusive, “ that the more important etchings which&nbsp;may be taken as types are dated, and that, the style of the etchings&nbsp;at different periods of Rembrandt’s career being fully as marked as&nbsp;that of his paintings, no more difficulty attends the classification</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
