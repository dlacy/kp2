<p><span class="font1">Various range-finders have been produced in countries outside the British Isles which, as they are the outcome of similar necessity&nbsp;and required for identical purposes, naturally resemble, more or&nbsp;less, the instruments already described.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Field artillery officers of all countries usually claim their gun to be their best range-finder. This may be another way of saying that&nbsp;a durable, one-man range-finder, capable of instantaneously finding&nbsp;modern artillery ranges with accuracy, has yet to be invented. In&nbsp;France the “ télémètre Goutier ” for field artillery, a two-man&nbsp;instrument, corresponds with the Watkin mekometer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The “ Gautier,” used by the Italian field artillery, is a one-man instrument, but requires a measured base-line. The &quot;Aubry ”&nbsp;telemeter, used by some of the Russian batteries in Manchuria, is&nbsp;very portable, but requires a measured base-line, and a slide rule to&nbsp;find the range. In the French and Russian infantry the “ prisme-télémètre,” the invention of Colonel Souchier, is used. It is small,&nbsp;very light, and can be carried in the same manner as field-glasses.&nbsp;French machine guns are ranged by the “ télémètre instantané,”&nbsp;an instrument of the Barr and Stroud type, with an aluminium base&nbsp;l metre in length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For work in the field the modern tendency abroad is to follow Barr and Stroud. In Germany, Hahn, Goerz and Zeiss have produced&nbsp;handy and fairly light short base range-finders, in outward appearance more or less similar to Marindin’s instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Zeiss range-finder, however, depends on the stereoscopic principle. It is open to the objection that best results can only be&nbsp;obtained with it by persons who are capable of seeing stereoscopically,&nbsp;and also, in individuals possessing this particular gift (a comparatively small proportion of the human race), stereoscopic vision&nbsp;may vary in power from day to day. Nevertheless the Zeiss range-finder has found favour in many countries, notably as the infantry&nbsp;range-finder in ltaly. For naval and harbour defence purposes&nbsp;the Barr and Stroud range-finder is very largely used throughout the&nbsp;world. In Italy a Barr and Stroud instrument, with the large base&nbsp;of 5 metres, was in 1908 under trial for coast artillery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the depression range-finder type in France, “ le télémètre Dévé ” is used at all heights of about 70 ft. and upwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Brazil possesses, in the invention of Captain Mario Netto, an excellent range-finder. It is supplied to the harbour defences of&nbsp;that country. It is accurate, handy, easily transported and recreated where required, and is not affected by the concussion of&nbsp;heavy gun-fire. The German coast range-finder of Hahn closely&nbsp;resembles the earlier Watkin instruments. In ltaly the Amici&nbsp;instrument is being replaced by the Braccialine. The latter inventor&nbsp;has also supplied his country with a horizontal base instrument.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After extended competitive trials in the U.S.A. the Lewis depression range-finder has been found superior </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font1">others presented to the Range-Finding Committee, and is recommended for adoption,&nbsp;It is a neat, workmanlike instrument, and gave an average mean&nbsp;error of 24 yds. in the ranges recorded during the trials. The&nbsp;maximum range was 12,000 yds. and the height of base 135½ ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The details of position-finders abroad, as in the British service, are confidential, and but little is published of the “ télémètre par&nbsp;recoupement ” of the French coast batteries, or the &quot;telegonio-metro Sollier ” of Italy. In the United States, B. A. Fiske has&nbsp;ingeniously adapted the principle of the Wheatstone bridge in the&nbsp;construction of the position-finder which bears his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RANGER, HENRY WARD (1858- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), American artist, was</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">born at Syracuse, New York, in January 1858. He became a prominent landscape and marine painter, much of his work&nbsp;being done in Holland, and showing the influence of the modern&nbsp;Dutch school. He became a National Academician (1906), and&nbsp;a member of the American Water Color Society. Among his&nbsp;paintings are, “ Top of the Hill,’’ Corcoran Gallery of Art,&nbsp;Washington, D.C.; and “ East River Idyll,” Carnegie Institute,&nbsp;Pittsburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RANGOON, the capital of Burma, situated on the left bank of the Hlaing or Rangoon river, 21 m. from the sea, in 16° 47' N.&nbsp;and 96° 13' E. In 1880 the city was detached from the main&nbsp;district, called Hanthawaddy, and formed into a separate&nbsp;district, with an area of 19 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 234,881,&nbsp;of whom just half were immigrants from India. Rangoon,&nbsp;from being a comparatively insignificant place, has within&nbsp;less than half a century risen to be the third seaport in British&nbsp;India, being surpassed only by Calcutta and Bombay in the&nbsp;volume of its trade. During the busy season of rice-export,&nbsp;which lasts from the end of December to the middle of May, the&nbsp;pool forming the port of Rangoon presents almost as crowded&nbsp;a scene as the Hugli at Calcutta. Rangoon has the double&nbsp;advantage of being situated near the sea and being served by a&nbsp;great river navigable for 900 m. behind it. The approach&nbsp;to the port is not difficult at any season of the year. With&nbsp;flat and shelving shores, the shoal-banks off the main mouths&nbsp;of the delta form the chief danger to shipping, and this is&nbsp;guarded against by a good service of lighthouses and lightships.&nbsp;For a length of seven or eight miles the river is from a mile to a&nbsp;mile and a quarter in breadth, so that there is plenty of accommodation for shipping. Here is concentrated the whole of the rich&nbsp;trade of the delta of the Irrawaddy. Great part of the river frontage is occupied with rice-mills, teak wharves and similar build-ings. The rice exported from Rangoon in 1904-5 amounted to&nbsp;28 million cwt. with a value of nearly 7 million sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The city is dominated by the great golden pile of the Shwe Dagôn pagoda, the centre of Burmese religious life. Rising to a&nbsp;height of 368 ft., this magnificent building is loftier than St&nbsp;Paul’s Cathedral in London, and its size is greatly enhanced by&nbsp;the fact that it stands on an eminence that is itself 168 ft. above&nbsp;the level of the city. It is covered with pure gold from base&nbsp;to summit, and once in every generation this gold is renewed by&nbsp;public subscription. Moreover, benefactions to this pagoda are&nbsp;one of the favourite methods of acquiring religious merit among&nbsp;the Burmese. The pagoda itself has no interior. It is a solid&nbsp;stupa of brick, in the form of a cone, raised over a relic chamber;&nbsp;and the place of worship is the surrounding platform with a&nbsp;perimeter of nearly 1400 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Though traditionally a site of great sanctity, Rangoon owes its first importance to its rebuilding in 1753 by Alompra, the&nbsp;founder of the Burmese monarchy, who gave it the present name&nbsp;of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Yan Kon,</span><span class="font2"> “the end of the war.” An English factory was&nbsp;opened here about 1790. On the outbreak of the first Burmese&nbsp;War, in 1824, it was taken by the British, but subsequently&nbsp;restored. It was captured a second time in 1852, and passed&nbsp;along with the province of Pegu into the hands of the British.&nbsp;It was destroyed by fire in 1850, and serious conflagrations&nbsp;occurred again in 1853 and 1855. Since the last devastation&nbsp;Rangoon has undergone considerable improvements. Until&nbsp;1874, when the existing municipality was constituted, the&nbsp;administration was in the hands of the local government,&nbsp;which devoted itself to raising the centre of the town above the&nbsp;river level, providing land fit for building purposes from the&nbsp;original swamp, which was flooded at spring-tides, and making&nbsp;roads, bridges, culverts and surface drains. In 1892 was introduced the sewage system, which now includes 6 m. of mains,&nbsp;22 m. of gravitating sewers, 4¾ m. of air mains and 44&nbsp;Shone’s ejectors. The water supply, drawn from the Victoria&nbsp;Lake, 5 m. distant, has recently been supplemented by an&nbsp;additional reservoir, 10 m. farther off. The city proper of&nbsp;Rangoon with the Kemmendine suburb is laid out on the block&nbsp;system, each block being 800 by 860 ft., intersected with&nbsp;regular streets. In the extensions to the east and west it has&nbsp;been decided to have no streets less than 50 ft. wide. The&nbsp;roads are still lighted by kerosene oil lamps, but electric lighting&nbsp;is in comtemplation. Electric tramways run to Pazundaung in&nbsp;one direction and to Alôn and Kemmendine in the other, as well&nbsp;as to the foot of the Shwe Dagôn Pagoda hill. Latterly the&nbsp;erection of masonry buildings, instead of plank houses, has been&nbsp;insisted on in the central portion of the city, with the result that&nbsp;fires have decreased in number. There are two large maidans,&nbsp;or commons, which are used as military parade grounds and for&nbsp;racing, as well as for golf links and other purposes of amusement.&nbsp;There is a garden round the Phayre Museum, managed by the&nbsp;Agri-Horticultural Society, and an extremely pretty and well-kept garden in the cantonments under the pagoda. Beyond&nbsp;these lie the Royal Lake and Dalhousie Park, with&nbsp;160 acres of water and 205 acres of well-laid-out and well-timbered park land. Dalhousie Park has recently been greatly&nbsp;extended, and the new Victoria Park, declared open on the</span></p>
