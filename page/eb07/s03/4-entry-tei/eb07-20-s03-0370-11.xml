or <hi rend="smallcaps">Siout</hi>, a large town of Upper Egypt, situated on the western bank of the Nile, about half a mile from the river, with which it communicates by a canal, crossed by a bridge of three arches. The inhabitants are chiefly Copts,</p><p>who are extensively employed in the manufacture of blue cloth, with which they carry on a considerable trade, and likewise in earthenware, natoon, and opium. The surrounding country is very fertile, producing abundance of fruits ; great quantities of wheat, barley, dhourra, and hemp, are likewise raised. Siut is the rendezvous of the caravans which proceed from Egypt southwards into the interior of Africa, to Sennaar and Darfur, from which countries they bring slaves and gold. This town is supposed to be the ancient Lycopolis; but the only remarkable antiquity which it presents, consists in the excavations made in the neighbouring mountains. These are numerous, consisting of chambers, many of which are thirty feet in height, co- vered with hieroglyphics, and exhibiting symbolical figures. They were most probably formed for sepulchral purposes. The town is large and populous, and the extensive district attached is likewise thickly inhabited. The united population amounts to 200,000. The taxes are reckoned at L.40,000. Lat. 27. 13. 14. N. Long. 31. 13. 32. E.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
