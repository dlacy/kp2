<p><span class="font2">partial vacuum, in the smoke-box roughly proportional to the weight of steam discharged per unit of time. The difference of&nbsp;pressure between the outside air and the smoke-box gases may&nbsp;be measured by the difference of the water levels in the limbs&nbsp;of a U tube, one limb being in communication with the smoke-box, the other with the atmosphere. The difference of levels&nbsp;varies from 1 to as much as 10 in. in extreme cases. The&nbsp;draught corresponding to the smallest rate of combustion&nbsp;shown in Table XX. in Professor Goss’s experiments, was 1∙72&nbsp;in. of water, and for the highest rate, namely 181, 7·48 in. of&nbsp;water. To get the best effect the area of the blast-nozzle must&nbsp;be properly proportioned to the size of the cylinders and be&nbsp;properly set with regard to the base of the chimney. The best&nbsp;proportions are found by trial in all cases.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Figs. 18 and 19 show two smoke-boxes typical of English practice. Fig. 18 is the smoke-box of the 6 ft. 6 in. six-coupled express passenger&nbsp;engines designed by G. Whale for the London &amp; North-Western&nbsp;Railway Company in 1904, and fig. 19 shows the box of the four-coupled express passenger engine designed by J. Holden for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Great Eastern Railway Company. In the case of the London &amp; North-Western engine (fig. 18), the blast-pipe orifice B is placed&nbsp;at about the centre of the boiler barrel, and the exhaust steam is&nbsp;discharged straight into the trumpet-shaped end of the chimney,&nbsp;which is continued down inside the smoke-box. In fig. 19 the blast&nbsp;orifice B is set much lower, and the steam&nbsp;is discharged through a frustum of a cone&nbsp;set in the upper part of the smoke-box&nbsp;into the short chimney. Fig. 20 shows&nbsp;the standard proportions recommended&nbsp;by the committee of the Railway Master Mechanics’ Association on Exhaust&nbsp;Pipes and Steam Passages (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proc. Amer.&nbsp;Railway Master Mechanics' Assoc.,</span><span class="font1"> 1906).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"> According to the Report, for the best results both H and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font1"> should be made&nbsp;as great as practicable, and then </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d = </span><span class="font1">0∙21D+ 0∙16</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font1">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b = 2d</span><span class="font1"> or 0∙5D, P=0∙32D,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">p </span><span class="font1">= 0∙22D, L=0∙6D or 0∙9D, but not of&nbsp;intermediate values. This last relation&nbsp;is, however, not well established. For&nbsp;much detailed information regarding&nbsp;American smoke-box practice, reference&nbsp;may be made to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Locomotive Sparks,</span><span class="font1"> by&nbsp;Professor W. F. M. Goss (London, 1902).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The arrangements for arresting sparks in American practice and on the continent of Europe are somewhat elaborate. In</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">English practice where a spark-arrester is put in it usually takes the form of a wire-netting dividing the smoke-box horizontally into two parts at a level just above the top row of&nbsp;tubes, or arranged to form a continuous connexion between the&nbsp;blast-pipe and the chimney.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fig. 19 illustrates an arrangement designed by J. Holden. The heavy sparks are projected from the tubes in straight lines and are&nbsp;caught by the louvres L, L, L, and by them deflected downwards to&nbsp;the bottom of the smoke-box, where they collect in a heap in the&nbsp;space D round a tube which is essentially an ejector. At every&nbsp;blast a small quantity of steam is caught by the orifice O and led to&nbsp;the ejectors, one on each side, with the result that the ashes are&nbsp;blown out into the receptacles on each side of the engine, one of&nbsp;which is shown at E. The louvres </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">l, 1, 1</span><span class="font1"> are placed to shield the&nbsp;central region occupied by the blast-pipe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">As the indicated horse-power of the engine increases, the weight of steam discharged increases, and the smoke-box&nbsp;vacuum is increased, thereby causing more air to flow through&nbsp;the furnace and increasing the rate of combustion. Thus the&nbsp;demand for more steam is automatically responded to by the&nbsp;boiler. It is this close automatic interdependence of engine&nbsp;and boiler which makes the locomotive so extraordinarily well&nbsp;suited for the purpose of locomotive traction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">§ 13. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Steam Engine. —</span><span class="font2">The steam engine of a locomotive has the general characteristics of a double-acting non-condensing&nbsp;engine (see Steam Engine). Distribution of steam is effected&nbsp;by a slide valve, sometimes fitted with a balancing device, and&nbsp;sometimes formed into a piston valve. All types of valves are&nbsp;with few exceptions operated by a link motion, generally of the&nbsp;Stephenson type, occasionally of the Allan type or the Gooch&nbsp;type, or with some form of radial gear as the Joy gear or the&nbsp;Walschaert gear, though the latter gear has characteristics which&nbsp;ally it with the link motions. The Stephenson link motion is&nbsp;used almost universally in England and America, but it has&nbsp;gradually been displaced by the Walschaert gear on the continent of Europe, and to some extent in England by the Joy&nbsp;gear. The general characteristics of the distribution effected&nbsp;by these gears are similar. Each of them, besides being a&nbsp;reversing gear, is an expansion gear both in forward and back-ward running. The lead is variable in the Stephenson link&nbsp;motion, whilst in the Walschaert and the Joy gears it is con-stant. Illustrations of these gears are given in the article&nbsp;Steam Engine, and the complete distribution of steam for&nbsp;both forward and backward running is worked out for a typical&nbsp;example of each of them in </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Valves and Valve Gear Mechanisms&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">by W. E. Dalby (London, 1906).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">§ </span><span class="font2">14. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cylinder Dimensions. —Adhesion. —Tractive Force. —</span><span class="font1">A </span><span class="font2">locomotive must be designed to fulfil two conditions. First,&nbsp;it must be able to exert a tractive force sufficient to start the&nbsp;train under the worst conditions possible on the railway over&nbsp;which it is to operate—for instance, when the train is stopped by&nbsp;signal on a rising gradient where the track is curved and fitted&nbsp;with a guard-rail. Secondly, it must be able to maintain the train&nbsp;at a given speed against the total resistances of the level or&nbsp;up a gradient of given inclination. These conditions are to a&nbsp;certain extent mutually antagonistic, since an engine designed&nbsp;to satisfy either condition independently of the other would be&nbsp;a different engine from that designed to make the best corn-promise between them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Equation (3), § 1 expresses the fundamental condition which must be satisfied when a locomotive is starting a train. The&nbsp;torque exerted on the driving-axle by the steam engine just at&nbsp;starting may be that due to the full boiler pressure acting in the&nbsp;cylinders, but usually the weight on the coupled wheels is hardly&nbsp;sufficient to enable advantage to be taken of the full boiler&nbsp;pressure, and it has to be throttled down by the regulator to&nbsp;prevent slipping. Sand, driven between the wheel and the rail&nbsp;by a steam jet, used just at starting, increases the adhesion&nbsp;beyond the normal value and enables a larger pressure to be&nbsp;exerted on the piston than would otherwise be possible. When&nbsp;the train is started and is moving slowly, the torque acting on&nbsp;the driving-axle may be estimated as that due to about 85% of&nbsp;the full boiler pressure acting in the cylinders. The torque</span></p>
