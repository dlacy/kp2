<p><span class="font4">that he had come alone and undefended to hear their side of the case. A council was held by them in the very depths of&nbsp;the hills, where no armed force could touch them. He was&nbsp;invited to attend it. It was a case of staking his life on trust.&nbsp;He displayed no hesitation, but mounted and rode unarmed&nbsp;with the messenger. Three friends rode with him. The&nbsp;confidence was justified. They met the assembled chiefs at&nbsp;the place appointed. The native grievances were laid before&nbsp;Mr Rhodes. At the end of a long discussion Mr Rhodes,&nbsp;having made and exacted such concessions as he thought fit,&nbsp;asked the question, “ Now, for the future is it peace or is it&nbsp;war?” And the chiefs, laying down their sticks as a symbol&nbsp;of surrendered arms, declared, “We give you one word: it is&nbsp;peace.” The scene, as described by one of the eye-witnesses,&nbsp;was very striking. Mr Rhodes, riding away, characterized it&nbsp;simply as “ one of the scenes which make life worth living.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">His life was drawing towards its end. He had still </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font4">few years, which he devoted with success to the development of&nbsp;the country which bore his name. The railway was brought&nbsp;to Bulawayo, and arrangements were made for carrying the&nbsp;line on in sections as far as the south end of Lake Tanganyika,&nbsp;a construction which was part of his pet scheme for connecting&nbsp;the Cape by a British line of communication with Cairo. He&nbsp;also concluded arrangements for carrying a telegraphic land&nbsp;line, through to Egypt, arid had the satisfaction of seeing the&nbsp;mineral development of the country fairly started. But the&nbsp;federal union of South Africa, to which he had always worked&nbsp;as the secure basis of the extension of British rule in the southern&nbsp;half of the continent, was not for him to see. The South African&nbsp;War broke out in 1899. Mr Rhodes took his part at Kimberley&nbsp;in sustaining the hardships of a siege; but his health was&nbsp;broken, and though he lived to see victory practically assured&nbsp;to British arms, peace had not been concluded when, on the&nbsp;26th of March 1902, he died at Muizenberg, near Cape Town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">. His life's work did not end actually with his death. He left behind him a will in which he dedicated his fortunes, as he&nbsp;had dedicated himself, exclusively to the public service. He&nbsp;left the bulk of his vast wealth for the purpose of founding&nbsp;scholarships at Oxford of the value each of £300 a year, to be&nbsp;held by students from every important British colony, and&nbsp;from every state and Territory of the United States of America.&nbsp;The sum so bequeathed was very large; but it was not for the&nbsp;munificence of the legacy that the will was received with&nbsp;acclamation throughout the civilized world: it was for the&nbsp;striking manifestation of faith which it embodied in the principles&nbsp;that make for the enlightenment and peace and union of mankind, and for the fine constancy of Mr Rhodes's conviction that&nbsp;the unity of the British Empire,' which he had been proud to&nbsp;serve, was among the greatest of organized forces uniting for&nbsp;universal good. The will was drawn up some years before his&nbsp;death. A codicil, signed during the last days of his life, gave&nbsp;evidence of some enlargement of his views as to the association&nbsp;of races necessary in order to secure the peace of the world,&nbsp;and added to the original scheme a certain number of scholarships to be held at the disposal of German students.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">The publication of the will silenced Mr Rhodes's detractors and converted many of his critics. It set a seal which could&nbsp;not be mistaken upon his completed life. The revulsion of&nbsp;sentiment towards him was complete, and his name passed at&nbsp;once in the public estimation to the place which it is probably&nbsp;destined to take in history, as one which his countrymen are&nbsp;proud to count among the great makers of the British Empire.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">(F L. L.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Rhodes Scholarships.—</span><span class="font4">The scholarship system founded by the will of Cecil Rhodes provides in perpetuity for the&nbsp;support at Oxford, for a term of three years each, of about&nbsp;175 selected scholars. Each scholar from the colonies and&nbsp;the United States has an allowance of £300 per annum during&nbsp;the continuance of his scholarship; those from Germany, as&nbsp;being nearer to Oxford, an allowance of £250 each. In each&nbsp;province of Canada, in each state of Australia, in the four&nbsp;collegiate schools of Cape Colony (Rondebosch, Stellenbosch,&nbsp;South African College, and St Andrew's College, Grahamstown),&nbsp;in the dominion of New Zealand, and in the colonics of Natal,&nbsp;Jamaica, Bermuda and Newfoundland, a scholar is elected each&nbsp;year. Three scholarships annually are assigned to Rhodesia.&nbsp;Each state and Territory of the American Union is entitled&nbsp;to have two scholars in residence, so that an election takes&nbsp;place in two years out of three. Five scholarships are provided&nbsp;annually for scholars from Germany.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In his will Rhodes mentions the objects he had in view in founding the different scholarships:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">l. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Colonial.—-“</span><span class="font3"> I consider that the education of young colonists at one of the universities in the United Kingdom is of great advantage&nbsp;to them for giving breadth to. their views, for their instruction in&nbsp;life and manners, and for instilling into their minds the advantage&nbsp;to the colonies as well as to the United Kingdom of the retention&nbsp;of the unity of the empire.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">. 2. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">American.—</span><span class="font3">“ I also desire to encourage and foster an appreciation of. the advantages which I implicitly believe will result from the union of the English-speaking people throughout the world,&nbsp;and to encourage in the students from the United States of North&nbsp;America who will benefit from the American scholarships to be&nbsp;established for the reason above given at the university of Oxford&nbsp;under this my will an attachment to the country from which they&nbsp;have, sprung, but without, I hope, withdrawing them or their sympathies from the land of their adoption or birth.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">3. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">German.—“</span><span class="font3"> I note the German emperor has made instruction in English compulsory in German schools. I leave five yearly&nbsp;scholarships at Oxford of £250 per annum to students of German&nbsp;birth, the scholars to be nominated by the German emperor for&nbsp;the time being. Each scholarship to continue for three years, so&nbsp;that each year after the first three there will be fifteen scholars.&nbsp;The object is that an understanding between the three Great Powers&nbsp;will render war impossible and educational relations make the&nbsp;strongest tie.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">He defines as follows the principles on which he wished his scholars to be selected :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">“ My desire being that the students who shall be elected to the scholarships shall not be merely bookworms, I direct that in the&nbsp;election of a student to a scholarship regard shall be had to (1) his&nbsp;literary and scholastic attainments; (2) his fondness for and success&nbsp;in manly outdoor sports such as cricket, football and the like;&nbsp;(3) his qualities of manhood, truth, courage, devotion to duty,&nbsp;sympathy for and protection of the weak, kindliness, unselfishness&nbsp;and fellowship; and (4) his exhibition during school days of moral&nbsp;force of character and of instincts to lead and to take an interest&nbsp;in his schoolmates, for those latter attributes will be likely in after&nbsp;life to guide him to esteem the performance of public duties as&nbsp;his highest aim.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The trustees named in the will for the management of the trust were Lord Rosebery, Lord Grey, Lord Milner, Sir Lewis Michcll,&nbsp;Dr L. S. Jameson, Mr Alfred Bcit and Mr Bourchier F. Hawksley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After consultation with the educational authorities of all the communities to which scholarships are assigned, the trustees arranged&nbsp;a system for the selection of scholars. This system, which is&nbsp;subject to such changes, as experience suggests, may be summarized&nbsp;as follows. Every candidate, in. order to become eligible, is required&nbsp;to pass the Responsions examination of the university of Oxford,&nbsp;or some examination accepted by the university as an equivalent.&nbsp;In the case of communities possessing universities or.colleges in&nbsp;affiliation with Oxford, a certain standing at those universities is&nbsp;accepted in lieu of Responsions. Examinations are held in two&nbsp;years out of three in each state of the American Union, and annually&nbsp;in colonies which do not have the affiliated universities or colleges&nbsp;referred to. German scholars are nominated by his. majesty the&nbsp;emperor of Germany. Candidates must be unmarried—must be&nbsp;between the ages of iç and. 25 (in Jamaica and Queensland, 18-25;&nbsp;in Newfoundland, 18-21; in Western Australia, 17725), and they&nbsp;must be, in the colonies, British subjects—in the United States and&nbsp;Germany, subjects of those countries, l.n each British colony&nbsp;electing scholars and in each state of the Union there is a committee&nbsp;of selection, composed commonly of leading educational authorities&nbsp;or high public officials. To these committees all candidates who&nbsp;have passed the qualifying tests submit their claims. The committees are entrusted with the power of selection, but are expected&nbsp;to exercise this power, as closely as circumstances permit, in accordance with the suggestions made by Rhodes. The trust arranges&nbsp;for the distribution of elected scholars among the colleges of Oxford,&nbsp;each of which has agreed to receive a limited number of approved&nbsp;candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>;</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G.
