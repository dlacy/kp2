<p><span class="font0">in Rossetti’s poetry as it culminates in his painting. The poet who should go beyond Rossetti would pass out of the&nbsp;realm of poetry into pure mysticism, as certain of his sonnets&nbsp;show. Fine as are the sonnets (of which the sonnet sequence,&nbsp;the “ House of Life/’ in the 1881 volume, may be specially mentioned), it is in his romantic ballads that Rossetti (notwithstanding a certain ruggedness of movement) shows his greatest&nbsp;strength. “ Sister Helen,” “ The Blessed Damozel,” “ Staff and&nbsp;Scrip,” “ Eden Bower,” “ Troy Town,” “ Rose Mary,” as representing the modern revival of the true romantic spirit, take&nbsp;a place quite apart from the other poetry of the time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rossetti’s poetry, and his prose too, is marked by an extraordinary fastidiousness of expression and beauty of diction; the form and colour of his style are alike marvellous in clearness and loveliness of language. But the dominant characteristic, after all, is the underlying idea, the romantic motive.&nbsp;By the revival of the romantic spirit in English poetry we&nbsp;mean something much more than the revival, at the close of&nbsp;the 18th century, of natural language, the change discussed&nbsp;hy Wordsworth in his famous Preface, and by Coleridge in&nbsp;his comments thereon—that change of diction and of poetic&nbsp;methods which is commonly supposed to have arisen with&nbsp;Cowper, or, if not with Cowper, with Burns. The truth is&nbsp;that Wordsworth and Coleridge were too near the great changes&nbsp;in question, and they themselves took too active a part in&nbsp;those changes, to hold the historical view of what the changes&nbsp;really were. Important as was the change in poetic methods&nbsp;which they so admirably practised and discussed, important&nbsp;as was the revival of natural language, which then set in, it&nbsp;was not nearly so important as that other revival which had&nbsp;begun earlier and of which it was the outcome—the revival&nbsp;of the romantic spirit, the Renascence of Wonder, even beneath&nbsp;the weight of 18th-century diction, the first movement of&nbsp;which is certainly English, and neither German nor French&nbsp;in its origin, and can be traced through Chatterton, Macpherson&nbsp;and the Percy Ballads.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As a mere question of methods, a reaction against the poetic diction of Pope and his followers was inevitable. But, in discussing the romantic temper in relation to the overthrow of the&nbsp;bastard classicism and didactic materialism of the 18th century,&nbsp;we must go deeper than mere artistic methods in poetry. When&nbsp;closely examined, it is in method only that the poetry of Cowper&nbsp;is different from the ratiocinative and unromantic poetry of&nbsp;Dryden and Pope and their followers. Pope treated prose subjects in the ratiocinative—that is to say, the prose—temper,&nbsp;but in a highly artificial diction which people agreed to call&nbsp;poetic. Cowper treated prose subjects too—treated them in&nbsp;the same prose temper, but used natural language; a nohle&nbsp;thing to do, no doubt. But this was only a part (and by no&nbsp;means the chief part) of the great work achieved by English&nbsp;poetry at the close of last century. That period, to be sure,&nbsp;rendered obsolete the poetic diction of Pope; but it introduced&nbsp;something more precious still—entire freedom from the hard&nbsp;rhetorical materialism imported from France; it gave a new&nbsp;seeing to English eyes, which were opened once more to the&nbsp;mystery and the wonder of the universe and the romance of&nbsp;man’s destiny; it revived, in short, the romantic spirit, but the&nbsp;romantic spirit enriched by all the clarity and sanity that the&nbsp;renascence of classicism was able to lend. Of the great movement which substituted for the didactic materialism of the&nbsp;18th century the new romanticism of the 19th, the leaders were&nbsp;Coleridge and Scott, admirably followed by Byron, Shelley&nbsp;and Keats. Not that Wordsworth was a stranger to the&nbsp;romantic temper. The magnificent image of Time and Death&nbsp;under the yew tree is worthy of any romantic poet that ever&nbsp;lived, yet it cannot be said that he escaped save at moments&nbsp;from the comfortable 18th-century didactics, or that he was a&nbsp;spiritual writer in the sense that Coleridge, Blake and Shelley&nbsp;were spiritual writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the true romantic feeh’ng, the ever-present apprehension of the spiritual world and of that struggle of the soul with earthly&nbsp;conditions which we have before spoken of, Rossetti’s poetry</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">is as full as his pictures—so full, indeed, that it was misunderstood by certain critics, who found in the most spiritualistic of poets&nbsp;and painters the founder of a “ fleshly school.” Although it&nbsp;cannot be said that “ The Blessed Damozel ” or “ Sister Helen ”&nbsp;or “ Rose Mary ” reaches to the height of the masterpieces of&nbsp;Coleridge, the purely romantic temper was with Rossetti a more&nbsp;permanent and even a more natural temper than with any&nbsp;other 19th-century poet, even including the author of “ Christa-bel ” himself. As to the other 19th-century poets, though the&nbsp;Ettrick Shepherd in “ The Queen’s Wake ” shows plenty of the&nbsp;true feeling, Hogg’s verbosity is too great to allow of really successful work in the field of romantic ballad, where concentrated&nbsp;energy is one of the first requisites. And even Dobell’s “ Keith of&nbsp;Ravelston ” has hardly been fused in the fine atmosphere of fairyland. Byron’s “footlight bogies” and Shelley’s metaphysical&nbsp;abstractions had of course but very little to do with the inner&nbsp;core of romance, and we have only to consider Keats, to whose&nbsp;“ La Belle Dame sans Merci ” and “ Eve of St Mark ” Rossetti&nbsp;always acknowledged himself to be deeply indebted. In the&nbsp;famous close of the seventh stanza of the “ Ode to a Nightingale</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Charmed magic casements opening on the foam Of perilous seas in faery lands forlorn ”—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">there is of course the true thrill of the poetry of wonder, and it is expressed with a music, a startling magic, above the highest&nbsp;reaches of Rossetti’s poetry. B ut, without the evidence of Keats’s,&nbsp;two late poems, “ La Belle Dame sans Merci ” and the “ Eve of&nbsp;St Mark,” who could have said that Keats showed more than a&nbsp;passing apprehension of that which is the basis of the romantic&nbsp;temper—the supernatural ? In contrasting Keats with Rossetti,&nbsp;it must always be remembered that Keats’s power over the&nbsp;poetry of wonder came to him at one flash, and that it was not&nbsp;(as we have said elsewhere) “ till late in his brief life that his.&nbsp;bark was running full sail for the enchanted isle where the old&nbsp;ballad writers once sang and where now sate the wizard Coleridge&nbsp;alone.” Though outside Coleridge’s work there had been&nbsp;nothing in the poetry of wonder comparable with Keats’s “ La&nbsp;Belle Dame sans Merci,” the latter had previously in “Lamia”&nbsp;entirely failed in rendering the romantic idea of beauty as a&nbsp;maleficent power. The reader, owing to the atmosphere surrounding the dramatic action being entirely classic, does not&nbsp;believe for a moment in the serpent woman. The classic&nbsp;accessories suggested by Burton’s brief narrative hampered&nbsp;Keats where to Rossetti (as we see in “ Pandora,” “ Cassandra”&nbsp;and “ Troy Town ”) they would simply have given birth to&nbsp;romantic ideas. It is perhaps with Coleridge alone that Rossetti&nbsp;can be compared as a worker in the Renascence of Wonder.&nbsp;Although his apparent lack of rhythmic spontaneity places him&nbsp;below the great master as a singer (for in these miracles of&nbsp;Coleridge’s genius poetry ceases to appear as a fine art at all&nbsp;—it is the inspired song of the changeling child “ singing,&nbsp;dancing to itself ”), in permanence of the romantic feeling,&nbsp;in vitality of belief in the power of the unseen, Rossetti stands&nbsp;alone. Even the finest portions of his historical hallad “ The&nbsp;King’s Tragedy ” are those which deal with the supernatural.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The events of Rossetti’s life may be briefly summarized. In the spring of i860 he married Elizabeth Eleanor Siddall, a&nbsp;milliner’s assistant, who, being very beautiful, was constantly&nbsp;painted and drawn by him. From 1856 onwards he had been&nbsp;very intimate with William Morris and Edward Burne-Jones,&nbsp;who had the greatest affection and artistic admiration for him.&nbsp;Mrs Rossetti, whose health was delicate, had one still-born&nbsp;child in 1861, and she died from an overdose of laudanum in&nbsp;February 1862. Rossetti then moved from Elackfriais to&nbsp;16 Cheyne Walk, Chelsea, where for a short time George&nbsp;Meredith, A. C. Swinburne and W. M. Rossetti lived with him.&nbsp;Mrs Rossetti’s own water-colour designs show an extraordinary&nbsp;genius for invention and a rare instinct for colour. Rossetti&nbsp;felt her death so acutely that in the first paroxysm of his&nbsp;grief he insisted upon his poems (then in manuscript) being&nbsp;buried in her coffin. But in 1869 the manuscripts were disinterred, and published in 1870. From this time to his death he</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
