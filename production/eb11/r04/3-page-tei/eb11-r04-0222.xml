By repeated radial and tangential branching a vast number of stamens are ultimately produced, and when these stamens assume a petaloid aspect we have as a consequence the double flowers which are so much admired. The carpels are much less subject to this petaloid change, and, as it generally happens in the most double of roses that some few at least of the anthers are formed with pollen, the production of seed and the possibility of cross-breeding become intelligible. Under natural circumstances rose flowers do not secrete honey, the attraction for insects being provided bv the colour and perfume and the abundance of pollen for food. I he stigmas and anthers come to maturity at the same time, and thus, while cross-fertilization by insect agency is doubtless most common, self-fertilization is not prevented.</p><p>The large number of species, subspecies, varieties and forms described as British may be included under about a dozen species. Among them may be mentioned 2?. <hi rend="italic">spinosissima, </hi>the Scotch rose, much less variable than the others; <hi rend="italic">R. rubiginosa</hi>  (or <hi rend="italic">R. eglantcria),</hi>  the sweet-brier, represented by several varieties; <hi rend="italic">R. canina</hi>, the dog rose (see fig.)» including</p><p>numerous subspecies and varieties; the large-fruited apple rose,</p><p><hi rend="italic">R. pomífera;</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">R. arvensis,</hi>  the parent of the Ayrshire roses. Cultivated roses are frequently “ buddecj ” or worked upon the stems of the brier or <hi rend="italic">R. canina,</hi>  or upon young seedling plants of the same species; and upon stems of an Italian rose called the Manetti, raised in the Milan Botanic Gardens about 1837. Other species, notably <hi rend="italic">R. polyantha,</hi>  also are used for stocks.</p><p>Roses have been grown for so many centuries and have been crossed and recrossed so often that it is difficult to refer the cultivated forms to their wild prototypes. The older roses doubtless originated from <hi rend="italic">R. gallica,</hi>  a native of central and southern Europe. <hi rend="italic">R. centifolia</hi>  (the cabbage rose), a native of the Caucasus, contributed its share. A cross between the two species named.may have been the source whence originated the Bourbon roses. The yellow-flowered Austrian and Persian brier originated from <hi rend="italic">R. lútea,</hi>  a native of Austria and the East. The monthly or China roses sprang from the Chinese <hi rend="italic">R. Índica, </hi>and these, crossed with others of the <hi rend="italic">R. centifolia</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">gallica</hi>  type, are the source of the <hi rend="sup">a</hi>  hybrid perpetuáis ” so commonly grown nowadays, because, in addition to their other attractions, their blooming season is relatively prolonged, and, moreover, is repeated in the autumn. Tea roses and noisettes, it is to be presumed, also acknowledge<hi rend="italic">R. indica</hi>  as one of their progenitors.. A magnificent race called “hybrid teas” have been evolved of late years, by crossing the tea roses and hybrid perpetuáis. They are much more vigorous in constitution than the true tea roses, while quite as beautiful in blossom and more perpetual in bloom than the hybrid perpetuáis. Recently, by crossing the Japanese <hi rend="italic">R. Wichuraiana</hi>  with hybrid perpetuáis, a beautiful and vigorous race of climbers has been produced. The Banksian rose is a Chinese ^limbing species, with small white or fawn-coloured flowers of great beauty, but rarely seen; the Macartney rose (2?. <hi rend="italic">bracteata)</hi>  is also of Chinese origin. Its nearly evergreen deep green leaves and large white flowers are very striking. The Japanese <hi rend="italic">R. rugosa</hi>  is also a remarkable species, notable for its bold rugose foliage, its large white or pink flowers, and its conspicuous globular fruit. <hi rend="italic">R. damascena</hi>  is cultivated in some parts of the Balkans for the purpose of making attar of roses. In Germany the same variety of rose is used, while at Grasse a strain of the Provence rose is cultivated for the same purpose. In India <hi rend="italic">R. damascena</hi>  is grown largely near Ghazipur for the purpose of procuring attar of roses and rose water.</p><p>Rose water is chiefly produced in Europe from the Provence or cabbage rose, <hi rend="italic">R. centifolia,</hi>  grown for the purpose at Mitcham and much more abundantly in the south of-France. Conserve of roses and infusion of roses, two medicinal preparations retained for their agreeable qualities rather than for any special virtue, are prepared from the petals of <hi rend="italic">R. gallica,</hi>  one variety of which was formerly grown for the purpose near the town of Provins. Conserve of dog rose is made from the ripe hips of the dog rose, <hi rend="italic">R. canina.</hi>  Its only use is in the manufacture of pills.</p><p>The rose is so universal a favourite that some portion of the garden must necessarily be devoted to it, if the situation be at all favourable. Many choice roses will not, however, thrive in the vicinity of large towns, since they require a pure air, and do not endure a smoky atmosphere. The best, soil for them is a deep rich strong loam free from stagnant moisture. Very light sandy or gravelly soils, or soils which are clayey and badly drained, are not suitable, and both must be greatly improved if rose-growing on them is attempted. Light soils would be improved by a dressing of strong loam in conjunction with cow-dung or nightsoil; the latter, provided it is properly prepared and not too fresh, is indeed the very best manure for roses in all but soils which are naturally very rich. Heavy soils are improved by adding burned earth or gritty refuse, with stable manure and leaf-mould, peat moss litter, &amp;c. ; and damp soils must necessarily be drained by trenching. Tea roses may, however, be grown to perfection in a gravel soil, provided it be well manured, cow manure being best. Roses generally require a constant annual supply of manure, and, if this is given as a mulching in autumn, it serves to protect their roots through the winter. They also require liberal supplies of water during the growing season, unless the surface is mulched or top-dressed from time to time with well-rotted manure. Aphides and caterpillars of all kinds may be checked by syringing with dilute tobacco water or some of the many insecticides now provided to facilitate this rather troublesome task.</p><p>Some growers prefer roses grown on their own roots, some on the Manetti and others on the brier stock. There is this to be said in favour of their own roots that, if the tops are killed down by accident or by severe weather, the roots will usually throw up new shoots true to their kind, which cannot be looked for if they are worked ; though it is sometimes recommended to plant deep in order that the rose itself may learn to do without its foster parent the stock. Too often, however, in the case of persons unfamiliar with roses, the choice rose dies, and the stock usurps its place. This is especially true of the Manetti stock, as its foliage is more like that of many cultivated forms than the brier, and therefore more easily overlooked. Where standards or half-standards are required, the brier stock from the hedges is always used. It forms the most reliable stock for dwarfs of all kinds, and especially for tea roses, most of which fail on the Manetti stock.</p><p>An open situation, not shaded but sheltered from strong winds, is what the rose prefers. October and November are the best months for planting roses, but if the weather be wet or frosty and the soil sticky, the plants should be placed in a sheltered place and protected by green boughs or matting until suitable conditions prevail. The planting should never be deep, the uppermost layer of roots being about J or 3 in. below the general level of the surface, and the soil should always be kept stirred with the hoe during the summer months. In regard to pruning, roses vary considerably, some requiring close cutting and others only thinning out; some again, such as strong growing climbers, may be safely pruned in autumn, and others are better left till spring. Instructions on this point as to the several groups of varieties will be found in most rose catalogues, and may be followed, provided the variety is true to name. It may.be laid down as a general rule that the more strongly growing varieties should be less severely cut back than the weakly varieties; and, again, the more tender the variety, the later in the spring should the pruning be done, April being the best month for pruning teas and noisettes. It should be remembered also that no</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
