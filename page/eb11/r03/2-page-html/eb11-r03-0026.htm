<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RICHTHOFEN, FERDINAND, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Baron von</span><span class="font1"> (1833-1905), German geographer and traveller, was born near Karlsruhe,&nbsp;Silesia, on the 5th of May 1833. He was educated at Breslau&nbsp;and Berlin, and in 1856 carried out geological investigations&nbsp;in the Tirol, subsequently extending them to Transylvania.&nbsp;In 1859 he accompanied as geologist the Prussian diplomatic&nbsp;mission to the Far East under Count von Eulenburg, and&nbsp;visited Ceylon, Japan, Formosa, the Philippines and Java,&nbsp;subsequently making an overland journey from. Bangkok to&nbsp;Moulmein and reaching Calcutta in 1862. No important work&nbsp;resulted from these travels, for much of Richthofen’s records&nbsp;and collections was lost. China was at the time inaccessible&nbsp;owing to the Taiping rebellion, but Richthofen was impressed&nbsp;with the desirability of exploring it, and after a visit to California, where he remained till 1868, he returned to the East.&nbsp;In a remarkable series of seven journeys he penetrated into&nbsp;almost every part of the Chinese Empire. He returned home&nbsp;in 1872, and a work comprising three large volumes and an&nbsp;atlas, which, however, did not cover the entire field or complete&nbsp;the author’s plan, appeared at Berlin in 1877-85 under the&nbsp;title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">China; Ergebnisse eigner Reisen und darauf gegründeter&nbsp;Studien.</span><span class="font1"> In this Standard work the author deals not only&nbsp;with geology but with every subject necessary to a general&nbsp;geographical treatise. Notably he paid close attention to the&nbsp;economic resources of the country he traversed; he wrote&nbsp;a valuable series of letters to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and first drew attention to the importance of the&nbsp;coalfields of Shantung, and of Kiaochow as a port. In 1875&nbsp;Richthofen was elected professor of geology at Bonn, but&nbsp;being fully occupied with his work in China he did not take up&nbsp;professorial duties till 1879; in 1883 he became professor&nbsp;of geography at Leipzig, and in 1886 was chosen to the same&nbsp;office at Berlin, and held it till his death. His lectures attracted&nbsp;numerous students who subsequently became eminent in&nbsp;geographical work, and in order to keep in touch with them&nbsp;he established his weekly geographical “ colloquium.” Of&nbsp;his written works, besides that on China, there may be mentioned “ Die Kalkalpen von Voralberg und Nordtirol ” in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jahrbuch der geologischen Reichsanstalt</span><span class="font1"> (1859-1861); “Die&nbsp;Metallproduktion Kaliforniens ” in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petermanns Mitteihrngen&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1865);. NöwraZ </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">System of Volcanic Rocks</span><span class="font1"> (San Francisco,&nbsp;1867); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aufgaben und Methoden der heutigen Geographie</span><span class="font1"> (an&nbsp;address delivered at Leipzig, 1883); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Führer für Forschtings-reisende</span><span class="font1"> (Berlin, 1886); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Triebkräfte und Richtungen der&nbsp;Erdkunde in neunzehnten Jahrhundert</span><span class="font1"> (address on his election&nbsp;as rector, Berlin, 1903). He was for many years president&nbsp;of the German Geographical Society, and he founded the&nbsp;Berlin Hydrographical Institute. He died on the 16th of&nbsp;October 1905.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICIMER (d. 472), master of the Roman Empire in the West during part of the 5th century, was the son of a prince of&nbsp;the Suebi and the daughter of Wallia, king of the Visigoths.&nbsp;His youth was spent at the court of Valentinian III., and he&nbsp;won distinction under Aetius. In 456 he defeated the Vandals&nbsp;in a sea-fight near Corsica, and on land near Agrigentum in&nbsp;Sicily, and backed by the popularity thus acquired, Ricimer&nbsp;then gained the consent of the Roman senate to an expedition&nbsp;against the emperor Avitus, whom he defeated in a bloody&nbsp;battle at Piacenza on the 16th of October 456. Avitus was&nbsp;taken prisoner and made bishop of Piacenza, and shortly&nbsp;afterwards sentenced to death. Ricimer then obtained from</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Leo I., emperor at Constantinople, the title patrician, but in 457 set up Majorianus as his own emperor in the West, and&nbsp;induced Leo to give his consent. When, however, Majorianus&nbsp;tried to rule by himself, Ricimer forced him to abdicate and&nbsp;caused, his assassination on the 7th of August 461. The&nbsp;successor whom Ricimer placed upon the throne was Libius&nbsp;Severus, who proved to be more docile than Majorianus, but&nbsp;had to face the rivalry of Leo in the East and Aegidius in Gaul.&nbsp;Upon his death in 465—said to be due to the poison of Ricimer&nbsp;—this emperor-maker ruled the West for eighteen months&nbsp;without an emperor, and then accepted Leo’s candidate&nbsp;Anthemius, diplomatically married his daughter, and for&nbsp;some time Bved in peace with him. Before long, however,&nbsp;Ricimer moved to Milan, readyto declare war upon Anthemius.&nbsp;St Epiphanius, bishop of Milan, patched up a truce, but in 472&nbsp;Ricimer was again before Rome with an army of Germans,&nbsp;proclaimed as emperor Olybrius, whom Leo had sent to pacify&nbsp;the two enemies, and after three months’ siege took the city,&nbsp;on the ist of July 472. Anthemius was massacred and Rome&nbsp;was a prey to Ricimer’s soldiers. He himself, however, died&nbsp;on the 18th of August 472, of malignant fever.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICINA, an ancient town of Picenum, Italy, 3 m. N.W. of the modern Macerata, on the banks of the river Potenza, in a&nbsp;fertile valley. It was probably a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">municipium</span><span class="font1"> until it was&nbsp;refounded by Pertinax and Septimius Severus, after which it&nbsp;bore the name Colonia Helvia Ricina Pertinax. The site is&nbsp;now deserted, but considerable ruins of a theatre and remains&nbsp;of baths and other buildings (all in brickwork of the imperial&nbsp;period) still exist; also the fragments of an ancient bridge&nbsp;over the Potenza.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICKETS, a constitutional disease of childhood characterized chiefly by a softened condition of the bones and by other&nbsp;evidences of perverted nutrition. It was first described in&nbsp;1649 by Arnold de Boot, a Frisian physician practising in Ireland. Its nature and causation are discussed under </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Metabolic&nbsp;Diseases.</span><span class="font1"> The name “ rickets ” is from the Old English&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wrickken,</span><span class="font1"> to twist; the more technical medical term, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rachitis,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which comes from Greek ῤάχἱςthe spine, was suggested&nbsp;by Francis Glisson in 1650, both from similarity of sound and&nbsp;from the part of the body which is one of the first to be affected. </span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rickets can seldom be recognized until several months after birth, and it most commonly attracts attention at about the&nbsp;end of the first year. The symptoms which precede the outward manifestation of the disease are marked disorders of the&nbsp;digestive and alimentary functions. The child’s appetite is&nbsp;diminished, and there is frequent vomiting, together with&nbsp;diarrhoea or irregularity of the bowels, the evacuations being&nbsp;clay-coloured and unhealthy. Along with* this there is a&nbsp;falling away in flesh. Importance is to be attached to certain&nbsp;other symptoms present in the early stages, namely, profuse&nbsp;sweating of the head and upper parts of the body, particularly&nbsp;during sleep, with at the same time dry heat of the Iower parts&nbsp;and a tendency in the child to kick off all coverings and expose&nbsp;the limbs. At the same time there is great tenderness of the&nbsp;bones, as shown by the pain produced on moving or handling&nbsp;the child. Gradually the changes in the shape of the bones&nbsp;become visible, at first chiefly noticed at the ends of the long&nbsp;bones, as in those of the arm, causing enlargements at the&nbsp;wrists, or in the ribs, producing a knobbed appearance at the&nbsp;junction of their ends with the costal cartilages. The bones&nbsp;also from their softened condition tend to become distorted&nbsp;and misshapen, both by the action of the muscles and by the&nbsp;superincumbent weight of the body. Those of the limbs are&nbsp;bent outwards and forwards, and the child becomes “ bow-legged ” or “ in-kneed ” often to an extreme degree. The&nbsp;trunk of the body likewise shows various alterations and&nbsp;deformities owing to curvatures of the spine, the flattening&nbsp;of the lateral curves of the ribs, and the projection forwards&nbsp;of the sternum. The cavity of the chest may thus be contracted&nbsp;and the development of the thoracic organs interfered with&nbsp;as well as their functions more or less embarrassed. The&nbsp;pelvis undergoes distortion, which may reduce its capacity to a</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
