<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ments. To this we will recur.) His desire to escape the difficulties of surface-reflexion led him to consider the radiation inside an imperfectly transparent body in the enclosure above spoken of. He thus arrived at an immediate&nbsp;proof of the existence of internal radiation, which recruits&nbsp;the stream of radiant heat in any direction step by step&nbsp;precisely to the amount by which it has been weakened by&nbsp;absorption. Thus the radiation and absorption rigorously&nbsp;compensate one another, not merely in quantity but in&nbsp;quality also, so that a body which is specially absorptive&nbsp;of one particular ray is in the same proportion specially&nbsp;radiative of the same ray, its temperature being the same&nbsp;in both cases. To complete the statement, all that is&nbsp;necessary is to show how one ray may differ from another,&nbsp;viz., in intensity, wave-length, and polarization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The illustrations which Stewart brought forward in&nbsp;support of his theory are of the two following kinds. (1) He&nbsp;experimentally verified the existence of internal radiation,&nbsp;to which his theory had led him. This he did by showing that a thick plate of rock-salt (chosen on account of its&nbsp;comparative transparency to heat-radiations) radiates more&nbsp;than a thin one at the same temperature,—surrounding&nbsp;bodies being in this case of course at a lower temperature,&nbsp;so that the effect should not be masked by transmission.&nbsp;The same was found true of mica and of glass. (2) He&nbsp;showed that each of these bodies is more opaque to radiations from a portion of its own substance than to radiation&nbsp;in general. Then comes his conclusion, based, it will be&nbsp;observed, on his fundamental assumption as to the nature of&nbsp;the equilibrium radiation in an enclosure. It is merely a&nbsp;detailed explanation that, once equilibrium has been arrived&nbsp;at, the consequent uniformity of radiation throughout the&nbsp;interior of a body requires the step-by-step compensation&nbsp;already mentioned. And thus he finally arrives at the statement that at any temperature a body’s radiation is exactly&nbsp;the same both as to quality and quantity as that of its&nbsp;absorption from the radiation of a black body at the same&nbsp;temperature. In symbolical language Stewart’s proposition (extended in virtue of a principle always assumed)&nbsp;amounts to this:—at any one temperature let </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> be the&nbsp;radiation of a black body, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">eR</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (where </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> is never greater&nbsp;than 1) that of any other substance, both for the same&nbsp;definite wave-length; then the substance will, while at&nbsp;that temperature, absorb the fraction </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of radiation of that&nbsp;wave-length, whatever be the source from which it comes.&nbsp;The last clause contains the plausible assumption already&nbsp;referred to. Stewart proceeds to show, in a very original&nbsp;and ingenious way, that his result is compatible with the&nbsp;known facts of reflexion, refraction, &amp;c., and arrives at&nbsp;the conclusion that for internal radiation parallel to a&nbsp;plane the amount is (in isotropic bodies) proportional to&nbsp;the refractive index. Of course, when the restriction of&nbsp;parallelism to a plane is removed the internal radiation is&nbsp;found to be proportional to the square of the refractive&nbsp;index. This obvious completion of the statement was first&nbsp;given by Stewart himself at a somewhat later date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So far Stewart had restricted his work to “dark&nbsp;heat,” as it was then called; and he says that he did so&nbsp;expressly in order to confine himself to rays “ which were&nbsp;universally acknowledged to produce heat by their absorption.” But he soon proceeded to apply himself to luminous&nbsp;radiations. And here he brought forward the extremely&nbsp;important fact that “ coloured glasses invariably lose their&nbsp;colour in the fire ” when exactly at the temperature of the&nbsp;coals behind them, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> they compensate exactly for their&nbsp;absorption by their radiation. But a red glass when&nbsp;colder than the coals behind appears red, while if it be&nbsp;hotter than they are it appears green. He also showed&nbsp;that a piece of china or earthenware with a dark pattern&nbsp;on a light ground appears to have a light pattern on a</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">dark ground when it is taken out of the fire and examined in a dark room. Hence he concluded that his extension&nbsp;of Prevost’s theory was true for luminous rays also.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this part of the subject he had been anticipated,&nbsp;for Fraunhofer had long ago shown that the flame of a&nbsp;candle when examined by a prism gives bright lines </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">maxima of intensity of radiation) in the position of the&nbsp;constituents of a remarkable double dark line </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> minima&nbsp;of radiation) in the solar spectrum, which he called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">D.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Hallows Miller had afterwards more rigorously verified the&nbsp;exact coincidence of these bright and dark lines. But&nbsp;Foucault@@<sup>1</sup> went very much farther, and proved that the&nbsp;electric arc, which shows these lines bright in its spectrum,&nbsp;not only intensifies their blackness in the spectrum of sunlight transmitted through it, but produces them as dark&nbsp;lines in the otherwise continuous spectrum of the light&nbsp;from one of the carbon points, when that light is made by&nbsp;reflexion to pass through the arc. Stokes about 1850&nbsp;pointed out the true nature of the connexion of these&nbsp;phenomena, and illustrated it by a dynamical analogy&nbsp;drawn from sound. He stated his conclusions to Sir W.&nbsp;Thomson,@@<sup>2</sup> who (from 1852 at least) gave them regularly&nbsp;in his public lectures, always pointing out that one constituent of the solar atmosphere is certainly sodium, and&nbsp;that others are to be discovered by the coincidences of&nbsp;solar dark lines with bright lines given by terrestrial substances rendered incandescent in the state of vapour.&nbsp;Stokes’s analogy is based on the fact of synchronism (long&nbsp;ago discussed by Hooke and others), viz., that a musical&nbsp;string is set in vibration when the note to which it is tuned&nbsp;is sounded in its neighbourhood. Hence we have only to&nbsp;imagine a space containing a great number of such strings,&nbsp;all tuned to the same note. Such an arrangement would&nbsp;form, as it were, a medium which, when agitated, would&nbsp;give that note, but which would be set in vibration by,&nbsp;and therefore diminish the intensity of, that particular&nbsp;note in any mixed sound which passed through it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">17. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Late in 1859 appeared Kirchhoff’s first paper on&nbsp;the subject.@@<sup>3</sup> He supplied one important omission in&nbsp;Stewart’s development of the theory by showing </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">why</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> it&nbsp;is necessary to use as an absorbing body one colder than&nbsp;the source in order to produce reversal of spectral lines.&nbsp;This we will presently consider. Kirchhoff’s proof of the&nbsp;equality of radiating and absorbing powers is an elaborate&nbsp;but unnecessary piece of mathematics, called for in consequence of his mode of attacking the question. He chose&nbsp;to limit his reasoning to special wave-lengths by introducing the complex mechanism of the colours of thin plates&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(Light, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xiv. p. 608), and a consequent appeal to&nbsp;Fourier’s theorem </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(Haemonic Analysis, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xi. p. 481),&nbsp;instead of to the obviously permissible assumption of a substance imperfectly transparent for one special wave-length,&nbsp;but perfectly transparent for all others; and he did not,&nbsp;as Stewart had done, carry his reasoning into the interior&nbsp;of the body. With all its elaboration, his mode of attacking the question leads us no farther than could Stewart’s.&nbsp;Both are ultimately based on the final equilibrium of temperature in an enclosure required by Carnot’s principle,&nbsp;and both are, as a consequence, equally inapplicable to&nbsp;exceptional cases, such as the behaviour of fluorescent or&nbsp;phosphorescent substances. In fact (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Thekmodynamics)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Carnot’s principle is established only on a statistical basis&nbsp;of averages, and is not necessarily true when we are dealing with portions of space, which, though of essentially&nbsp;finite dimensions, are extremely small in comparison with&nbsp;the sentient part of even the tiniest instrument for measuring temperature.</span></p>
