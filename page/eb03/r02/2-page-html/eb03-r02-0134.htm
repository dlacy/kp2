<p><span class="font0">cenſors were Papirius and Sempronius, 'both patricians; ajιd from this order they continued to be elected for&nbsp;near ιoo years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This new creation ſerved to reſtore peace for ſome time among the orders ; and the triumph gained over&nbsp;the Volſcians by Geganius the conſul, added to the univerſal ſatisfaction that reigned among the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This calm, however, was but of ſhort continuance : for, ſome time after, a famine preſſing hard upon the&nbsp;poor, the uſual complaints againſt the rich were renewed ; and theſe, as before, proving ineffectual, produced&nbsp;new ſeditious. The conſuls were accuſed of neglect&nbsp;in not having laid in proper quantities of corn : they,&nbsp;however, diſregarded the murmurs of the populace,&nbsp;content with exerting all their care in attempts to ſupply the preſſing neceſſities. But though they did all&nbsp;that could be expected ſrom active magiſtrates, in providing and diſtributing proviſions to the poor ; yet&nbsp;Spurius Mælius, a rich knight, who had bought up all&nbsp;the corn of Tuſcany, by ſar outſhone them in liberality.&nbsp;This demagogue, inflamed with a ſecret deſire of becoming powerful by the contentions in the ſtate, diſtributed corn in great quantities among the poorer fort&nbsp;each day, till his houſe became the aſylum of all ſuch&nbsp;as wiſhed to exchange a liſe of labour for one of lazy&nbsp;dependence. When he had thus gained a ſufficient&nbsp;number of partizans, he procured large quantities of&nbsp;arms to be brought into his houſe by night, and formed a conſpiracy,, by which he was to obtain, the command, while ſome of the tribunes, whom he had found&nbsp;means to corrupt, were to act under him, in ſeizing&nbsp;upon the liberties of his country. Minucius ſoon diſcovered the plot ; and informing the ſenate thereoſ,&nbsp;they immediately formed the reſolution of creating a&nbsp;dictator, who ſhould have the power of quelling the&nbsp;conspiracy, without appealing to the people. Cincin-nat-us, who was now 8o years old, was choſen once&nbsp;more to reſcue his country from impending danger.&nbsp;He began by ſummoning Mælius to appear ; who refiiſed to obey. He next ſent Ahala, the maſter of his&nbsp;horſe, to force him ; who, meeting him in the forum,&nbsp;and preſſing Mælius to follow him to the dictator’s tribunal, upon his refuſal Ahala killed him upon the ſpot.&nbsp;The dictator applauded the reſolution of his officer,&nbsp;and commanded the. conſpiraror’s goods to be fold, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">his houſe tobe demoliſhed, diſtributing his ſtores among&nbsp;the people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tribunes of the people were much enraged at the death of Mælius ; and, in order to puniſh the ſenate, at the next election, inſtead of conſuls, inſiſted&nbsp;upon reſtoring their military tribunes. With this the&nbsp;ſenate were obliged to comply. The next year, however, the government returned to its ancient channel,&nbsp;and conſuls were choſen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Veientes had long been the rivals of Rome ; they had ever taken the opportunity of its internal&nbsp;diſtreſſes to ravage its territories, and had even threatened its ambaſſadors, ſent to complain of theſe injuries,&nbsp;with outrage. In war they had been extremely formidable, and had cut off almoſt all the Fabian family ;&nbsp;who, to the number of 306 perſons, had voluntarily&nbsp;undertaken to defend the frontiers againſt their in-•curſions. It ſeemed now therefore determined, that&nbsp;the city of Veii, whatever it ſhould coſt, was to fall;&nbsp;and the Romans accordingly ſat regularly down before&nbsp;it, prepared for a long and painful reſiſtance. The&nbsp;ſtrength of the place, or the unikilſulneſs of the befie-gers, may be inferred from the continuance of the ſiege,&nbsp;which laſted for 10.years; during which time the army&nbsp;continued encamped round it, lying in winter under&nbsp;tents made of the ſkins of beaſts, and in ſummer driving oi) the operations of the attack. Varions was the&nbsp;ſucceſs, and many were the commanders that directed&nbsp;the ſiege : ſiunetimes all the beſiegers works were ſe·-ſtroyed, and many of their men cut off by ſallies fron»&nbsp;the town ; ſometimes they were annoyed by an army&nbsp;of Veians, who attempted to bring aſſiſtance fron»&nbsp;without. A liege ſo bloody ſeemed to threaten depopulation to Rome itſelf, by draining its forces continually away ; ſo that a law w?s obliged to be mad«&nbsp;for all the bachelors to marry the widows of the ſoldiers who were (lain. In order to carry it on with&nbsp;greater vigour, Furius Camillus was created dictator,&nbsp;and to him was intruſted the ſole power of managing&nbsp;the long protracted war. Camillus, who, without intrigue or any ſolicitation, had raiſed himſelf to the firfl&nbsp;eminence in the ſtate, had been made one of the cen-fors ſome time before, and was conſidered as the head&nbsp;of that office ; he was afterwards made a military tribune, and had in this poſt gained ſeveral advantage%&nbsp;over the enemy. It was his great courage and abilities in the above offices that made him thought moſt&nbsp;worthy to ſerve his country on this preſſing occaſion..&nbsp;Upon his appointment, numbers of the people flocked&nbsp;to his ſtandard, confident of ſucceſs under ſo experienced a commander. Conſcious, however, that he&nbsp;was unable to take the city by ſtorm, he ſecretly&nbsp;wrought a mine into it with vaſt labour, which opened&nbsp;into the midſt of the citadel. Certain thus of ſucceſs,&nbsp;and finding the city incapable of relief, he ſent to the&nbsp;ſenate, deſiring that all who choſe to ſhare in the plunder of Veii ſhould immediately repair to the army.&nbsp;Then giving his men directions how to enter at the&nbsp;breach, the city was inſtantly filled with his legions,,&nbsp;to the amazement and conſternation of the beſieged,&nbsp;who, but a moment before, had reſted in perfect ſecurity. Thus, like a ſecond Troy, was the city of Veii 1&nbsp;taken, after a 10 years liege, and with its ſpoils enriched the conquerors ; while Camillus himſelf, tranſported with the honour of having ſubdued the rival of&nbsp;his native city, triumphed after the manner of the&nbsp;kings of Rome, having his chariot drawn by four&nbsp;milk-white horſes ; a diſtinction which did not fail to&nbsp;diſguſt the majority of the ſpectators, as they conſidered&nbsp;thoſe as ſacred, and more proper for doing honour to&nbsp;their gods than their generals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His uſual good fortune attended Camillus in another expedition againſt the Faliſei ; he routed their army,&nbsp;and beſieged their capital city Falerii, which threatened&nbsp;a long and vigorous reſiſtance. Here a ſchoolmaſter,&nbsp;who had the care of the chilſhen belonging to the&nbsp;principal men of the city, having found means to decoy them into the Roman camp, offered to put them,&nbsp;into the hands of Camillus, as the ſureſt means of inducing the citizens to a ſpeedy ſurrender. The general was ſtruck with the treachery of a wretch whoſe&nbsp;duty it was to protect innocence, and not to betray&nbsp;it ; and immediately ordered him to be ſtripped, his&nbsp;hands tied behind him, and in that ignominious manner to be whipped into the town by Iris own ſeboſers.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
