A boat was brought up the river, through one of these gates, only by raising the waters of the inferior reach, and depressing those of the upper : and it could not escape observation, that when the gates were far asunder, a vast body of water must be discharged before this could be done, and that it would be a great improvement to double each gate, with a very small distance between. Thus a very small quantity of water would fill the interval to the desired height, and allow the boat to come through ; and this thought was the more obvious, from a similar practice having preceded it, viz. that of navigating a small river by means of double bars, the lowest of which lay flat in the bottom of the river, but could be raised up on hinges. We have mentioned this already ; and it appears to have been an old practice, being mentioned by Stevinus in his valuable work on sluices, published about the beginning of the seventeenth century ; yet no trace of this method is to be found of much older dates. It occurred, however, accidentally, pretty often in the flat countries of Holland and Flanders, which being the seat of frequent wars, almost every town and village was fortified with wet ditches, connected with the adjoining rivers. Stevinus mentions particularly the works of Conde, as having been long employed, with great ingenuity, for rendering navigable a very long stretch of the Scheldt. The boats were received into the lower part of the fossee, which was sepârated from the rest by a stone batardeau, serving to keep up the waters in the rest of the fossee about eight feet. In this were a sluice and another dam, by which the boats could be taken into the upper fossee, which communicated with a remote part of the Scheldt, by a long canal. This appears to be one of the earliest locks.</p><p>In the first attempt to introduce this improvement in the navigation of ri¼ers already kept up by weirs, which gave a partial and interrupted navigation, it was usual to avoid the great expense of the second dam and gate, by making the lock altogether detached from the river, within land, and having its basin parallel to the river, and communicating by one end with the river above the weir, and by the other end with the river below the weir, and having a floodgate at each end. This was a most ingenious thought ; and it was a prodigious improvement, free from all the inconveniences of currents, ice, &amp;c. &amp;c. It was called a <hi rend="italic">schlussel, </hi>or lock, with considérable propriety ; and this was the origin of the word <hi rend="italic">sluice,</hi>  and of our application of its translation <hi rend="italic">loch.</hi>  This practice being once introduced, it w-as not long before engineers found that a complete separation of the navigation from the bed of the river w-as not only the most perfect method for obtaining a sure, easy, and uninterrupted navigation, but that it was in general the most economical in its first construction, and subject to no risk of deterioration by the action of the current, which was here entirely removed. Locked canals, therefore, have almost entirely supplanted all attempts to improve the natural beds of rivers ; and this is hardly ever attempted except in the flat countries, where they can hardly be said to differ from horizontal canals.</p><p>The attentive reader must have observed our anxiety to render this dissertation worthy of his notice, by making it practically useful. We have on every occasion appealed from all theoretical deductions, however specious and well supported, to fact and observation of those spontaneous phenomena of nature which are continually passing in review before us in the motion of running waters. Resting in this manner our whole doctrines on experiment, on the observation of what really happens, and what happens in a way which we cannot or do not fully explain, these spontaneous operations of nature came insensibly to acquire a particular value in our imagination. It has also happened in the course of our reflections on these subjects, that these phenomena have frequently presented themselves to our view in groups, not less remarkable for the extent and the importance of their consequences, than for the simplicity, and frequently the seeming insignificancy, nay frivolity, of the means employed. Our fancy has therefore been sometimes warmed witll the view of a something, an</p><p>Ens agitans molem, ct magno se corpore miscens.</p><p>This has sometimes made us express ourselves in a way that is susceptible of misinterpretation, and may even lead into a mistake of our meaning.</p><p>We therefore find ourselves obliged to declare, that by the term Nature, which we have so frequently used <hi rend="italic">con amore,</hi>  w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>e do not mean that indescribable idol which the self-conceit and vanity of some philosophers or pretended philosophers have set up and ostentatiously worshipped, that<hi rend="italic">ens rationis,</hi>  that creature of the imagination, which has long been the object of cool contemplation in the closet of the philosopher, and has shared his attention with many other playthings of his ever-working fancy. By Nature we mean that admirable system of general laws, by which the adored Author and Governor of the universe has thought fit to connect the various parts of this wonderful and goodly frame of things, and to regulate all their operations.</p><p>We are not afraid of continually appealing to the laws of nature ; and, as we have already observed in the article Philosophy, we consider these general laws as the most magnificent displays of Infinite Wisdom, and the contemplation of them as the most cheering employment of our understandings.</p><p>Igneus est illis vigor ct cœlestis origo Seminibus.</p><p>At the same time we despise the cold-hearted philosopher who stops short here, and is satisfied, perhaps inwardly pleased, that he has completely accounted for every thing by the laws of unchanging nature ; and w-e suspect that this philosopher would analyse with the same frigid ingenuity, and explain by irresistible <hi rend="italic">βτοsγη,</hi>  the tender attachment of her whose breast he sucked, and who by many anxious and slecpless nights preserved alive the puling infant. But let us rather listen to the w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ords of him who was the most sagacious observer and the most faithful interpreter of nature’s laws, our illustrious countryman Sir Isaac Newton.</p><p>“ Elegantissima hæcce rerum compages non nisi consilio et <hi rend="italic">dominio</hi>  entis sapientissimi et potentissimi oriri potuit. Omnia, simili constructa consilio, suberunt <hi rend="italic">unius</hi>  dominio. Hic omnia regit, non ut <hi rend="italic">anima mundi,</hi>  sed ut universorum dominus. Propter dominium suum, dominus deus <hi rend="italic">&lt;xαsrο-χζύ,τωι</hi>  nuncupatur. Deus ad servientes respicit, ct <hi rend="italic">deitas </hi>est dominatio dei, non in corpus proprium, uti sentiunt quibus deus est natura seu anima mundi, sed in servos. Deus summus est ens eternum, infinitum, absolute perfectum. Ens utcunque perfectum, at sine dominio, non est dominus deus. Hunc cognoscimus, solummodo per proprietates ejus et attributa. Attribuuntur ut ex phenomenis dignoscuntur. Phenomena sunt sapientissimæ et optimæ rerum structuræ, atque causæ finales. Hunc admiramur ob perfectiones ; hunc veneramur et colimus ob dominium.”</p><p>Our readers will probably be pleased with the following list of authors who have treated professedly of the motions of rivers : Guglielmini <hi rend="italic">De Fluviis et Castellis Aquarum— Danubius Illustratus ;</hi>  Grandi <hi rend="italic">De Castellis ;</hi>  Zendrini <hi rend="italic">De Motu Aquarum ;</hi>  Frisius <hi rend="italic">De Fluviis ;</hi>  Lecchi, <hi rend="italic">Idroslaticai Idraulica; ↑Λ</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">c</hi><hi rend="italic">∖∖</hi><hi rend="italic">e</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">eA</hi><hi rend="italic">∖</hi><hi rend="italic">Λ,Sperienze Idrauliche ;</hi>  Belidor, <hi rend="italic">Architecture Hydraulique ;</hi>  Bossut, <hi rend="italic">Hydrodynamique ;</hi>  Du Buat, <hi rend="italic">Hydraulique ;</hi>  Silberschlag, <hi rend="italic">Théorie des Fleuves ; Lettres de</hi>  M.
