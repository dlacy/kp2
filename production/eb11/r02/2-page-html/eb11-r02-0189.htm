<p><span class="font2">at West Point, where he was stationed at the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861. He was made a lieutenant-colonel of infantry&nbsp;in May and brigadier-general of volunteers in August of that&nbsp;year. In the Peninsular campaign, after taking part in the&nbsp;battles of Beaver Dam Creek and Gaines’ Mill, he was taken&nbsp;prisoner in the hard-fought action of Glendale or Frazier’s Farm.&nbsp;Exchanged after six weeks’ captivity, he commanded a division&nbsp;with conspicuous ability and ccfurage in the second battle of&nbsp;Bull Run. Shortly after this he was placed in command of&nbsp;the militia of his native state when Lee’s invasion threatened&nbsp;it. In November 1862 he was commissioned major-general of&nbsp;volunteers, and appointed to command the 1. Corps of the Army&nbsp;of the Potomac, and took part in the battle of Fredericksburg.&nbsp;At the time of General Meade’s appointment to command the&nbsp;Army of thc Potomac many desired to see Reynolds sclected for&nbsp;that post, but he gave Meade his whole-hearted support in the&nbsp;three critical days preceding the battle of Gettysburg </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">He was placed by Meade in command of the left wing (L, IIL&nbsp;and XI. corps and Buford’s cavalry division) and thrown forward&nbsp;to Gettysburg to cover the concentration of the Army of the&nbsp;Potomac. The battle which ensued there, on the ist of July&nbsp;1863, took its shape from Reynolds’s resolution to support Buford’s&nbsp;cavalry with the I. and XL crops. Meade was notified, and&nbsp;hurried forward the right wing under Hancock. Reynolds&nbsp;himself was killed very early in the day by a rille bullet. A&nbsp;bronze statue was placed on the field of Gettysburg and a&nbsp;portrait in the library at West Point by thc men of the I. Corps.&nbsp;The state of Pennsylvania erected a granite shaft on the spot&nbsp;where he fell, and an equestrian bronze statue stands in&nbsp;Philadelphia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His elder brother </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">William</span><span class="font2"> (1815-1879), a naval officer, served afloat in the Civil War, effected many useful reforms while&nbsp;acting secretary of the navy in 1873 and 1874, and retired from&nbsp;the United States navy in 1877 as a rear-admiral.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REYNOLDS, SIR JOSHUA (1723-1792), the most prominent figure in the English school of painting, was born at Plympton&nbsp;Earl, in Devonshire, on the 16th of July 1723. He received a&nbsp;fairly good education from his father, who was a clergyman and&nbsp;the master of the free grammar school of the place. At the&nbsp;age of seventeen, thc lad, who had already shown a fondness&nbsp;for drawing, was apprenticed in London to Thomas Hudson,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font2">native of Devonshire, who, though a mediocre artist, was&nbsp;popular as a portrait painter. Reynolds remained with Hudson&nbsp;for only two years, and in 1743 he returned to Devonshire, where,&nbsp;settling at Plymouth Dock, he employed himself in portrait&nbsp;painting. By the end of 1744 he was again in London. He was&nbsp;weU received by his old master, from whom he appears previously&nbsp;to have parted with some coldncss on both sides. Hudson&nbsp;introduced him to the artists’ dub that met in Old Slaughter’s,&nbsp;St Martin’s* Lane, and gave him much advice as to his work.&nbsp;Reynolds now painted a portrait of Captain the Hon. John&nbsp;Hamilton, the first that brought him any notice, with those of&nbsp;other people of some repute; but on the death of his father in&nbsp;1746 he established himself with two of his sisters at Plymouth&nbsp;Dock, whcre he painted numerous portraits, and it was here&nbsp;that he came under the influence of the works of one of the&nbsp;painters who materially affected his art. This was William&nbsp;Gandy of Exeter, who had died in 1730, and whose painting,&nbsp;derived through his father from VanDyck, was pronounced by&nbsp;Northcote to come nearer to nature in the texture of flesh than&nbsp;that of any artist who ever lived. The influence on him of&nbsp;Gandy may be seen in the early self-portrait of the National&nbsp;Portrait GalIcry, so rich in impasto and strong in light and&nbsp;shade, in which he is secn shading his eyes with his hand.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Meanwhile the pleasant urbanity of manner which distinguished Reynolds throughout life had been winning for him friends. He had *made the acquaintance of Lord Edgcumbe,&nbsp;and by him was introduced to Captain (afterwards Viscount)&nbsp;Keppel. Keppel was made aware of Reynolds’s ardent desire&nbsp;to visit Italy; and, as he had just been appointed to the command of the Mediterranean squadron, he gracefully invited the&nbsp;artist to accompany him in his own ship, thc “ Centurion.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The offer was gladly accepted. While Keppel was conducting his tedious negotiations with the dey of Algiers, relative to the&nbsp;piracy with which that potentate was charged, Reynolds resided&nbsp;at Port Mahon, the guest of the governor of Minorca, painting&nbsp;portraits of the principal inhabitants; and in December 1749&nbsp;he sailed for Leghorn, and thence, with all eagerness, made his&nbsp;way to Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He has confessed that his first sight of the works of Raphael was a grievous disappointment, but he recognized afterwards, as&nbsp;he said, that the fault was in himself, and he brought his mind&nbsp;ultimately into the fitting posture of reverence. The fact is&nbsp;significant of Reynold’s attitude towards the older masters.&nbsp;It has been often noticed that in his “ Discourses ” and elsewhere he praises just the very masters whose practice his own&nbsp;work implicitly condemns. The truth is that Reynolds was&nbsp;naturally a good critic, but was not strong enough to believe in&nbsp;his own opinions if they ran counter to the prevailing taste of his&nbsp;times. Of the early Italians he praises the “ simplicity and&nbsp;truth ” and observes that they “ deserve the attention of a&nbsp;student much more than many later artists.” In Venice he&nbsp;adopted a method of study that only a born painter could have&nbsp;thought of, making memoranda of the gradations of light and&nbsp;shade in the pictures, “ and this without any attention to the&nbsp;subject, or to the drawing of the figures.” On the other hand,&nbsp;we find him lavishing both attention and eulogy on the later&nbsp;Italian mannerists, such as Guido and the Carracci, and even&nbsp;Salviati and Vasari.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">After a residence of more than two years in'Rome, where he caught a severe cold which resulted in the deafness that clung&nbsp;to him for the rest of his life, Reynolds, in the spring of 1752,&nbsp;spent five months in visiting Parma, Florence, Venice and other&nbsp;important cities of Italy. Returning to England by way of&nbsp;Paris, Reynolds, after a brief stay in Devonshire, established&nbsp;himself as a portrait painter in St Martin’s Lane, London, whence&nbsp;he afterwards removed to Great Newport Street, and finally, in&nbsp;1760, to Leicester Square, where he continued to paint till his death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In London, Reynolds stepped at once and without a struggle into a foremost position as the fashionable portrait painter of&nbsp;the day. In this he was greatly helped by bis success in society.&nbsp;Throughout his career his social occupations claimed the next&nbsp;place to his painting, and here it may be noticed that, though&nbsp;we read of some little ostentation in the form of a showy chariot&nbsp;and liveried lackeys, his good taste always kept him from any&nbsp;undue “ push,” or adulation of the great. At the outset Lord&nbsp;Edgcumbe played the part of the generous patron, and exerted&nbsp;himself to obtain commissions for his protégé, of whose ability&nbsp;the portraits which he now produced—especially the famous&nbsp;full-length of his old friend Keppel—were sufficient guarantee.&nbsp;The artist’s painting room was thronged with the wealth and&nbsp;fashion of London. In 1755 his clients for the year numbered&nbsp;120, and in 1757 the number of sittings recorded in his pocketbooks reached a total of 677. He was not always so busy, but&nbsp;his popularity never really waned, though various other artists&nbsp;competed with him for popular applause. First the Swiss&nbsp;Liotard had his momemt of popularity; and at a later period&nbsp;there was Opie, and the more formidable and sustained rivalry&nbsp;of Gainsborough and of Romney; but in the midst of all&nbsp;Reynolds maintained his position unimpaired. During the first&nbsp;year of his residence in London he had made the acquaintance of&nbsp;Dr Johnson, which, diverse as the two men were, became a&nbsp;friendship for life. To him Burke and Goldsmith, Garrick,&nbsp;Sterne and Bishop Percy were before long added. At the&nbsp;hospitable dinner-table of Reynolds such distinguished men&nbsp;enjoyed the freest and most unconstrained companionship, and&nbsp;most of them were members of the “ Literary Club,” established,&nbsp;at the painter’s suggestion, in 1764.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1760 the London world of art was greatly interested by the novel proposal of the Society of Artists to exhibit their works&nbsp;to the public. The hall of the society was at their disposal&nbsp;for the purpose; and in the month of April an exceedingly&nbsp;successful exhibition was opened, the precursor of many that&nbsp;followed. To this display Reynolds contributed four portraits.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
