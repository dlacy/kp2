<p><label>RHINE</label>
a large river of Germany, famous both in ancient and modern hiſtory. It riſes among the Alpes Lepontiæ, or Griſons ; and ſirſt traverſing the Lacus Acronius, divides the Rhæti and Vindelici from the Helvetii, and then the Germans from the Gauls and Belgæ ; and running from ſouth to north for the greateſt part of its way, and at length bending its courfe weſt, it empties itſelf at ſeveral mouths (Cæfar); at three mouths into the German ocean, (Pliny) ; viz. the weftern, or Helius ; tlie northern, or Fleuvus ; and the middle between both theſe, which retains the ori-ginal name, <hi rend="italic">Rhenus :</hi> and in this Ptolemy agrees.— Mela and Tacitus mention two channels, and as many mouths, the right and left ; the former running by Germany, and the latter by Gallia Belgica : and thus alſo Aſinius Pollio, and Virgil ; the cut or trench of Druſus not being made in their time, whereby the middle channel was much drained and reduced, and therefore overlooked by Tacitus and Mela ; and which Pliny calls the <hi rend="italic">Scanty.</hi> To account ſor Cæfar’s ſeveral mouths, is a matter of no ſmall difficulty with the commentators ; and they do it no otherwife than by admitting that the Rhine naturally formed ſmall drains or rivulets from itſelf ; the cut of Druſus being long poſterior to him ; in whoſe time Aſinius Pollio, quoted by Strabo, who agrees with him therein, affirmed that there were but two mouths, finding ſault with thofe who made them more : and he muſt mean the larger mouths, which emitted larger ſtreams. The Romans, efpecially the poets, uſed the term <hi rend="italic">Rhenus</hi> ſor <hi rend="italic">Germany,</hi> (Martial).—At preſent, the river, after entering the Netherlands at Schenkinhaus, is divided into ſeveral channels, the two largeſt of which obtain the names of the <hi rend="italic">Lech</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Waal,</hi> which running thro* the United Provinces, falls into the German ocean be-low Rotterdam.</p>
