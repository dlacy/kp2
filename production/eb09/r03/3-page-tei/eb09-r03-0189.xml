Transverse striation occurs among the fibres to a varying extent, being well marked in cases where the muscle is much used. The muscles which move the body as a whole are arranged as circular and longitudinal series, but they are arranged in special groups and do not form a complete layer of the body-wall as in the various worms. Some of the longitudinal muscles are specially developed in connexion with the tail or pedicle. Other muscles are developed in connexion with special systems of organs,—the trochal disks, the jaw apparatus, and the reproductive system. The muscles in connexion with the trochal disκ serve to protrude or withdraw it, and to move it about, when extruded, in various directions. The protrusion is probably, however, generally effected by the elasticity of the integument coming into play during the relaxation of the retractor muscles, and by a general contraction of the body wall. The tentaculiferous apparatus of <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa</hi>  aud <hi rend="italic">Gephyrca</hi>  is protruded in the same manner.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Trochal Disk.—</hi>This structure is the peculiar characteristic of the class. It is homologous with the ciliated bands of the larvæ of Echinoderms, Chietopods, Molluscs, &amp;c., and with the tentaculiferous apparatus of <hi rend="italic">Polyzoa</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Gcphyrea,</hi>  and has been termed in common with these a “velum.” This velum presents itself in various stages of complexity. It is found as a single circum-oral ring <hi rend="italic">(pilulium),</hi>  as a single præ-oral ring (Chætopod larvæ), or as a single præ-oral ring coexisting with one or more post-oral rings (Chætopod larvæ, Holothurian larvæ). We may here assume that the ancestral condition was a single circum-oral ring associated with a terminal mouth and the absence of an anus, and that the existence of other rings posterior to this is an expression of metameric segmentation, Ce., a repetition of similar parts. With the development of a prostomiate condition a certain change necessarily takes place in the position of this baud: a portion of it comes to lie longitudinally; but it may still remain a single band, as in the larva of many Echinodenns. Howhave the other above-mentioned conditions of the velum come about ? How has the præ-oral band been developed ? Two views have been held with regard to this question. According to the one view, the fact whether the single band is a præ-oral or a post-oral one depends upon the position in which the anus is about to develop. H' the anus develops in such a position that mouth and anus lie on one and the same side of the band, the latter becomes præ-oral ; if, however, the anus develops so that the mouth and anus lie upon opposite sides of the band, the band becomes post-oral. If we hold this view we must consider any second band, whether præ- or post-oral, to arise as a new development. The other view premises that the anus always forms so as to leave the primitive ring or “architroch” post-oral, i.e., between mouth and anus. Concurrently with the development of a prostomium this architroch somewhat changes its position and the two lateral portions come to lie longitudinally ; these may be supposed to have met in the median dorsal line and to have coalesced so as to leave two rings—the one præ-oral (a “ cephalo-troch”), the other post-oral (a “branchiotroch”); this latter may atrophy, leaving the single præ-oral ring, or it may become further developed and thrown into more or less elaborate folds. The existing condition of the trochal disk or velum in the <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi>  seems to the writer of this article to bear out the latter view as to the way in which modifications of the velum ιfiay have come about.</p><p>In its simplest condition it forms a single circum-oral ring, as in <hi rend="italic">Microcodon</hi>  (fig. 1, d). The structures at the sides of the mouth in this form are stated to be bristles, and have therefore nothing to do with the velum (fig. 4, a, <hi rend="italic">ρ).</hi>  This simple ring may become thrown into folds, so forming a series of processes standing up around the mouth; this is the condition in <hi rend="italic">Stephanoeeros</hi>  (fig. 4, b,fi). There are, however, but few forms presenting this simple condition ; and it must be remembered that the evidence for the assumption here made, that this is a persistent architroch and not a branchiotroch persisting where a Cephalotroch has vanished, is not at present conclusive. This band, may, while remaining single and perfectly continuous, become prolonged around a lobe overhanging the mouth—a prostomium. This condition occurs in <hi rend="italic">Philodina </hi>(fig. 4, E, F, <hi rend="italic">p);</hi>  the two sides of the post-oral ring do not meet dorsally, but are carried up and are continuous with the row of cilia lining the “wheels.” There is thus one continuous ciliated band, a portion of which runs up in front of the mouth. This condition corresponds to that of the Auricularian larva. The folding of the band has become already somewhat complicated ; <hi rend="sup">F</hi>a hypothetical intermediate condition is shown in fig. 4,c, D. The next stage in the advancing complexity is that the prostomial portion of the band (fig. 4, G, H, p) becomes separated as a distinct ring, a Cephalotroch ; we find such a stage in <hi rend="italic">Laeinularia</hi>  (fig. 4,</p><p>G, H), where both Cephalotroch and branchiotroch remain fairly simple in shape. In <hi rend="italic">Mclieerta</hi>  (fig. 4, ι, j) both Cephalotroch and branchiotroch are thrown into folds. Lastly, we find that in such forms as <hi rend="italic">Braxhionus</hi>  the Cephalotroch becomes first convoluted and</p><p>then discontinuous (fig. 4, κ, L, c), and further it may become so reduced as to be represented only by a few isolated tufts, as in <hi rend="italic">Asplanchna</hi>  (fig. 1, l, <hi rend="italic">x</hi>  and x'); in such a form as <hi rend="italic">Lindia</hi>  (fig. 6, c) the branchiotroch has vanished and the Cephalotroch has become reduced to the two small patches at the sides of the head.</p><p>The trochal apparatus serves the <hi rend="italic">Rotifera</hi>  as a locomotive organ and to bring the food particles to the mouth ; the cilia work so as to produce currents towards the mouth.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Digestive System.—</hi>This consists of the following regions:—(1) the oral cavity ; (2) the pharynx ; (3) the oesophagus ; (4) the stomach ; (5) the intestine, which terminates in an anus. The anus is absent in one group.</p><p>The pharynx contains the <hi rend="italic">mastax</hi>  with its teeth ; these are calcareous structures, and are known as the <hi rend="italic">trop&gt;hi.</hi>  In a typical mastax (8, 9) <hi rend="italic">(Bra-</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Chionus,</hi>  fig. 5, a)</p><p>there are a median</p><p>anvil or <hi rend="italic">incus</hi>  and</p><p>two hammer-like</p><p>portions, <hi rend="italic">mallei.</hi></p><p>The incus consists</p><p>of two <hi rend="italic">rami (e)</hi></p><p>resting upon a cen</p><p>tral <hi rend="italic">fulcrum (∕) ;</hi></p><p>each malleus con</p><p>sists of a handle or</p><p><hi rend="italic">manubrium</hi>  (c) and</p><p>a head or <hi rend="italic">uneus</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">(d),</hi>  which often</p><p>presents a comb</p><p>like structure.
