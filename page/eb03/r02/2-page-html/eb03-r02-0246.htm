<p><span class="font0">equally reſiſting fibre at F, muſt be ≈=∕× ς∙^r. And ſo on of all the reſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we ſuppoſe all the fibres to exert equal reſiſtances at the inſtant of fracture, we know, from the ſimpleſt&nbsp;elements of mechanics, that the reſiſtance of all the&nbsp;particles in the line CD, each acting equally in its own&nbsp;place, is the ſame as if all the individual reſiſtances were&nbsp;united in the middle point </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g.</span><span class="font0"> Now this total reſiſtance&nbsp;is the reſiſtance or ſtrength</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ</span><span class="font0">of each particle, multiplied&nbsp;by the number of particles. This number may be expreſſed by the line CD, becauſe we have no reaſon to&nbsp;ſuppoſe that they are at unequal diſtances. Therefore,&nbsp;in comparing different ſections together, the number of&nbsp;particles in each are as the ſections themſelves. Therefore DC may repreſent the number of particles in the&nbsp;line DC'. Let us call this line the depth of the beam,&nbsp;and expreſs it by the ſymbol </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ci.</span><span class="font0"> And ſince we are at&nbsp;preſent treating of roofs whole rafters and other parts&nbsp;are commonly of uniform breadth, let us call AH or&nbsp;BI the breadth of the beam, and expreſs it by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;let CA be called its length, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">l.</span><span class="font0"> We may now expreſs&nbsp;the ſtrength of the whole line CD by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f~&gt;id,</span><span class="font0"> and we&nbsp;may ſuppoſe it all concentrated in the middle point </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Its mechanical energy, therefore, by which it reſiſts&nbsp;the energy of the weight </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vυ,</span><span class="font0"> applied at the diſtance ∕,&nbsp;is</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ.</span><span class="font0"> CD. Cy, while the momentum of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font0"> is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">w.</span><span class="font0"> CA.&nbsp;We muſt therefore have </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſ.</span><span class="font0"> CD. Cy=∞. CA, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fd.fd&nbsp;z= nv.</span><span class="font0"> ∕, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fd : <sup>r</sup>w~ I</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſd '. <sup>r</sup>w~ 2l : &lt;l.</span><span class="font0"> That&nbsp;is, twice the length of the beam is to its depth as the&nbsp;abſolute ſtrength of one of its vertical planes to its relative ſtrength, or its pow<sup>,</sup>er of reſiſting this tranſverſe&nbsp;fracture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is evident, that what has been now demonſtrated of the reſiſtance exerted in the line CD, is equally true&nbsp;of every line parallel to CD in the thickneſs or breadth&nbsp;of the beam. The abſolute ſtrength of the whole ſection of fracture is properly repreſented by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f. d. b<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;we ſtill have 2/ : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d—ſdb</span><span class="font0"> : ⅛&gt;.,∙ or twice the length of&nbsp;the beam is to its depth as the abſolute ſtrength to the&nbsp;relative ſtrength. Suppoſe the beam 12 feet long and&nbsp;one foot deep ; then whatever is its abſolute ſtrength,&nbsp;the 24th part of this will break it if hung at its extremity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But even this is too favourable a ſtatement ; all the fibres are ſuppoſed to meet alike in the inſtant of fracture. But this is not true. At the inſtant that the&nbsp;fibre at D breaks, it is ſtretched to the utmoſt, and is&nbsp;exerting its whole force. But at this inſtant the fibre&nbsp;at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> is not ſo much ſtretched, and it is not then exerting its utmoſt force. If we ſuppoſe the extenſion of&nbsp;the fibres to be as their diſtance from C, and the actual&nbsp;exertion, of each to be as their extenſions, it may eaſily&nbsp;be ſhown (ſee Strength and Strain), that the whole&nbsp;reſiſtance is the ſame as if the full force of all the fibres&nbsp;were united at a point </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font0"> diſtant from C by one third of&nbsp;CD. In this caſe we muſt ſay, that the abſolute&nbsp;ſtrength is to the relative ſtrength as three times the&nbsp;length to the depth ; ſo that the beam is wêaker than&nbsp;by the former ſtatement in the proportion of two to&nbsp;three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Even this is more ſtrength than experiment juſtiſies ; and we can ſee an evident reaſon for it. When the beam is ſtrained, not only are the upper fibres&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ſtretched, but the lower fibres are compreſſed. This is</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">very diſtinctly ſeen, if we attempt to break a piece oſ cork cut into the ſhape of a beam : this being the caſe,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">C is not the centre of fracture. There is ſome point </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c </span><span class="font0">which lies between the fibres which are ſtretched and&nbsp;thoſe that are compreſſed. This fibre is neither&nbsp;ſtretched nor ſqueezed ; and this point is the real centre&nbsp;of fracture : and the lever by which a fibre D reſiſts,&nbsp;is not DC, but a ſhorter one Dr; and the energy of&nbsp;the whole reſiſtances muſt be leſs than by the ſecond&nbsp;ſtatement. Till we know the proportion between the&nbsp;dilatability and compreſſibility of the parts, apd the relation between the dilatations of the fibres and the reſiſtances which they exert in this ſtate of dilatation, we&nbsp;cannot poſitively ſay where the point </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> is ſituated, nor&nbsp;what is the ſum of the actual reſiſtances, or the point&nbsp;where their action may be ſuppoſed concentrated. The&nbsp;firmer w<sup>,</sup>oods, ſuch as oak and cheſnut, may be ſuppoſed to be but ffightly compreſſible ; we know that willow and other ſoft woods are very comprejſible. Theſe&nbsp;laſt muſt therefore be weaker : for it is evident, that&nbsp;the fibres which are in a ſtate of compreſſion do nqt&nbsp;reſiſt the fracture. It is well known, that a beam of&nbsp;willow may be cut through from C to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span class="font0"> without weakening it in the leaſt, if the cut be filled up by a wedge&nbsp;of hard wood ſtuck in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We can only ſay, that very ſound oak and red fir have the centre of effort ſo ſituated, that the abſolute&nbsp;ſtrength is to the relative ſtrength in a proportion not&nbsp;leſs than that of three and a half times the length of&nbsp;the beam to its depth. .-∖ ſquare inch of found oak&nbsp;will carry about 8000 pounds. If this bar be firmly&nbsp;fixed in a wall, and project 12 inches, and be loaded&nbsp;at the extremity with 200 pounds, it will be broken.&nbsp;It will juſt bear 190, its relative ſtrength being -<sub>3</sub>∙<sup>,</sup>-<sub>r</sub> of&nbsp;its abſolute ſtrength ; and this is the caſe only with the&nbsp;ſineſt pieces, ſo placed that their annual plates or layers&nbsp;are in a vertical poſition. A larger log is not fo&nbsp;ſtrong tranſverſely, becauſe its plates lie in various directions round the heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe obſervations are enough to give us a diſtinct notion of the vaſt diminution of the ſtrength of timber&nbsp;when the ſtrain is acroſs it ; and w<sup>,</sup>e ſee the juſtice of&nbsp;the maxim which we inculcated, that the carpenter, in&nbsp;framing roofs, ſhould avoid as much as poſſible the ex-poſing his timbers to tranſverſe ſtrains. But this cannot be avoided in all caſes. Nay, the ultimate ſtrain,&nbsp;ariſing ſrom the very nature of a roof, is tranſverſe.&nbsp;The rafters muſt carry their own weight, and this tends&nbsp;to break them acroſs : an oak beam a foot deep will not&nbsp;carry its own weight if it project more than 60 ſeet.&nbsp;Beſides this, the rafters muſt carry the lead, tyling, or&nbsp;fiâtes. We muſt therefore conſider this tranſverſe&nbsp;ſtrain a little more particularly, ſo as to know what&nbsp;ſtrain will be laid on any part by an unavoidable load,&nbsp;laid on either at that part or at any other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have hitherto ſuppoſed, that the beam had one of its ends fixed in a wall, and that it was loaded at the&nbsp;other end. This is not an uſual arrangement, and was&nbsp;taken merely as affording a ſimple application of the&nbsp;mechanical principles. It is much more uſual to have&nbsp;the beam ſupported at the ends, and loaded in the&nbsp;middle. Let the beam FEGH (ſig. 2.) reſt on the&nbsp;props E and G, and be loaded at its middle point C&nbsp;with a weight W. It is required to determine t he&nbsp;ſtrain </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">at </span><span class="font0">the ſection CD ? It is plain that the beam will</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
