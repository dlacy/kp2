<p><span class="font0">⅓EδV∕EV= - δT∕T,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">so that T varies as V<sup>-⅓</sup>, or inversely as the linear dimensions when the enclosure is shrunk uniformly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Combining these results, it appears that E varies as T<sup>4</sup>; this is Stefan’s empirical law for the complete radiation corresponding&nbsp;to the temperature, first established on these lines by Boltzmann.&nbsp;Starting from the principle that this radiation must be a function&nbsp;of the temperature alone, this adiabatic process has in fact&nbsp;given us the form of the function. These results cannot, however, be extended without modification to each separate constituent of the complete radiation, because the shrinkage of the&nbsp;enclosure alters its wave-length and so transforms it into a&nbsp;different constituent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Law of Distribution of Energy. —</span><span class="font0">The effect of compressing&nbsp;the complete radiation is thus to change it to the constitution&nbsp;belonging to a certain higher temperature, by shortening all&nbsp;its wave-lengths by the proportion of one-third of the compression by volume, the temperature being in fact raised by&nbsp;the same proportion; at the same time increasing in a uniform&nbsp;ratio the amounts corresponding to each interval δλ, so as to&nbsp;get the correct total amount of energy for the new temperature.&nbsp;In the compression each constituent alters so that Tλ remains&nbsp;constant, and the energy E<sub>λ</sub>δλ in the range δλ in other respects&nbsp;changes as a function of T alone. Hence generally E<sub>λ</sub>δλ must&nbsp;be of form F(T)</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0">(Tλ)δλ. But for each temperature</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is equal to E and so varies as T<sup>4</sup>, by Stefan’s law; that is,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">T<sup>-1</sup>F(T)</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∫<sub>0</sub>f</span><span class="font0">∕(Tλ)</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0">(Tλ) ocT<sup>4</sup>,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">so that T<sup>-1</sup>F(T) ∝T<sup>4</sup>. Thus, fina∏y, E<sub>λ</sub>δλ is of form AT<sup>5</sup></span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0">(Tλ)δλ or Aλ<sup>-δ</sup>φ(Tλ)δλ, which is Wien’s general formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Transformation of a Single Constituent. —</span><span class="font0">It is of interest&nbsp;to follow out this adiabatic process for each separate con-stituent of the radiation, as a verification, and also in order&nbsp;to ascertain whether anything new is thereby gained. To&nbsp;this end let now E(λ, T)δλ represent the intensity of the radiation between λ and λ+δλ which corresponds to the temperature&nbsp;T. The pressure of this radiation, when it is without special&nbsp;direction, is in intensity one-third of this; thus the application&nbsp;of Carnot’s principle shows, as before, that in adiabatic compression T ocV<sup>-⅓</sup>, so that a small linear shrinkage in the ratio&nbsp;I-</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font0"> raises T in the ratio I+</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font0">. We have still to express the&nbsp;equation of energy. The vibratory energy E(λ, T)δλ. V in&nbsp;volume V, together with the mechanical work ⅓E(λ, T)δλ. 3</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font0">V,&nbsp;yields the vibratory energy</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">E(λ(ι -x). T(ι+x))δλ(ι </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">-x)</span><span class="font0">. V(ι -3x); thus, writing E and Eλ or E (λ, T) we have, neglecting x<sup>2</sup>,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">so that a partial differential equation of which the integral is</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">E = Aλ<sup>-5</sup>φ(Tλ),</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the same formula as was before obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This method, treating each constituent of the radiation separately, has in one respect some advantage, in that it is&nbsp;necessary only to postulate an enclosure which totally reflects&nbsp;that constituent, this being a more restricted hypothesis than&nbsp;an absolutely complete reflector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To determine theoretically the form of the function φ we must have some means of transforming one type of radiation into&nbsp;another, different in essence from the adiabatic compression&nbsp;already utilized. The condition that the entropy of the independent radiations in an enclosure is a minimum when&nbsp;they are all transformed to the same temperature with total&nbsp;energy unaltered, is already implicitly fulfilled; it would thus&nbsp;appear that any further advance must involve (§ 11) the dynamics&nbsp;of the radiation and absorption of material bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">8. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Temperature of an Isolated Ray. —</span><span class="font0">The temperature of each&nbsp;independent constituent of a radiation has here been taken to&nbsp;be a function of the intensity Eλ, where Eλδλ is the energy per&nbsp;unit volume in the range between wave-lengths </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">λ</span><span class="font0"> and λ+δλ:&nbsp;the condition is, however, imposed that this radiation is in-different as to direction. When a beam of radiation travels&nbsp;without  loss in a definite direction across a medium, its form&nbsp;varies as it progresses; but it is reversible inasmuch as it can&nbsp;be turned back at any stage, or concentrated without loss, by&nbsp;perfect reflectors. If the energy of the beam has a temperature, its value must therefore remain constant throughout the&nbsp;progress of the beam, by the principle of Carnot. Now by&nbsp;virtue of a relation in geometrical optics, which on a corpuscular&nbsp;theory would be one aspect of the fundamental dynamical&nbsp;principle of Action, the cross-section δS at any place on the&nbsp;beam, and the conical angle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">δω</span><span class="font0"> within which the directions of its&nbsp;rays are there included, are such that the value of V<sup>-2</sup>δSδω is&nbsp;conserved along the beam, V being the velocity of propagation&nbsp;of the undulations. If we represent the amount of radiant&nbsp;energy transmitted per unit time across the section δS of the&nbsp;beam by IδSδω, it will follow that in passing along the beam its&nbsp;intensity of illumination I varies as V<sup>-2</sup>, or as the square of the&nbsp;index of refraction, provided there is no loss of energy in trans-mission. This condition requires that changes of index shall&nbsp;be gradual, otherwise there would be loss of energy by partial&nbsp;reflexions; in free aether I is itself constant along the beam.&nbsp;The volume-density of the energy in any part of the directed&nbsp;beam is V<sup>-1</sup>Iδω; it is thus inversely as the solid angular con-centration of the rays and directly as the cube of the index of&nbsp;refraction. Now we may consider this beam, of aggregate&nbsp;intensity IδSδω, to form an elementary filament of the radiation&nbsp;issuing in the direction of the normal from a perfect radiator.&nbsp;As such a body absorbs completely and therefore radiates&nbsp;equally in all directions in front of it, the total intensity of&nbsp;radiation from its element of surface δs is δs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font0">l cos </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Θδω,</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;δs. πl, while the volume-density of the total advancing and&nbsp;receding radiation in front of it is 2V<sup>-1</sup>∫1</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0">ω, and therefore&nbsp;47rV<sup>-1</sup>I. If we take here Iδλ to represent the intensity between&nbsp;wave-lengths λ and λ+δλ, this density is the quantity Eλ of&nbsp;which the temperature of the radiator is a function. Thus&nbsp;the quantity I—which optically is a measure of the brightness&nbsp;of the beam, and is conserved along it to the extent that μ<sup>2</sup>I&nbsp;is the same from whichever of its cross-sections the beam&nbsp;is supposed to be emitted—also determines its temperature,&nbsp;the latter being that of an enclosure containing undirected&nbsp;radiation of the same range δλ which is density Eλδλ given by&nbsp;Eλ=4πV<sup>-1</sup>I, where V is the velocity of radiation in the enclosure.&nbsp;When a beam of radiation travels without suffering absorption,&nbsp;its temperature thus continues to be that of its source multiplied&nbsp;by the coefficient of emission of the source for that kind of&nbsp;radiation, this coefficient being less than unity except in the&nbsp;case of a perfect radiator; but when its intensity I falls by δl&nbsp;in any part of its path owing to absorption or other irreversible&nbsp;process, this involves a further fall of temperature of the energy&nbsp;of the beam and a rise of entropy which can be completely&nbsp;determined when the relation connecting μ<sup>-3</sup>E<sub>λ</sub> with T and λ&nbsp;is known. Any directed quality in radiant energy increases&nbsp;its effective temperature. Splitting a beam into two at a&nbsp;reflecting and refracting' surface diminishes the temperature&nbsp;of each part; it is true that if the reflecting surface were non-molecular the operation could be reversed, but actually the&nbsp;reversed rays would encounter the reflecting molecules in&nbsp;different collocations, and could not (§ 11) recombine into&nbsp;the same detailed phase-relations as before. The direct solar&nbsp;radiation faffing on the Earth is almost completely convertible&nbsp;into mechanical effect on account of its very high temperature;&nbsp;there seems ground for believing that certain constituents&nbsp;of it can actually be almost wholly turned to account by the</span></p>
