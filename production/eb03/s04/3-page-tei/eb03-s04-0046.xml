Inhabits the iſles of Sumatra and Japan ; is very docile. In Japan it is taught ſeveral tricks, and carried about the country by mountebanks. Kempfer was informed by one of theſe people, that the baboon he had was 102 years old.</p><p>9.	The great baboon, or ſimia papio ſphinx, with hazel irides ; ears small and naked ; face canine, and very thick ; middle of the face and fore head naked ; and of a bright vermilion colour ; tip of the noſe of the ſame, and ending truncated like that of a hog; ſides of the noſe broadly ribbed, and of a fine violet hue ; the opening of the mouth very ſmall ; cheeks, throat, and goat-like beard yellow ; hair on the fore-head very long, turns back, is black, and forms a kind of pointed creſt. Head, arms, and legs, covered with ſhort hair, yellow and black intermixed ; the breaſt with long whitiſh yellow hairs, the ſhoulders with long brown hair. Nails fiat ; feet and hands black ; tail four inches long, and very hairy ; buttocks bare, red, and filthy ; but the ſpace about them is of a moſt elegant purple colour, which reaches to the inſide of the upper part of the thighs.</p><p>This was deſcribed by Mr Pennant from a ſtuffed ſpecimen in Sir Aſhton Lever’s muſeum. In Auguſt 1779, a live animal of this ſpecies was ſhown at Edinburgh, and in October following at Cheſter, where being ſeen by Mr Pennant, that inquiſitive naturaliſt has deſcribed it in his Hiſtory of Quadrupeds. “ It differed little (he obſerves) in colour from the above, being in general much darker. Eyes much ſunk in the head, and ſmall. On the internal ſide of each ear was a white line, pointing upwards. The hair on the fore-head turned up a like a toupee. Feet black ; in other reſpects reſembled the former. In this I had an opportunity of examining the teeth. The cutting teeth were like thoſe of the rest of the genus ; but, in the upper and lower jaw, were two canine, or rather tuſks, near three inches long, and exceedingly ſharp and pointed. This animal was five feet high, oſ a moſt tremendous ſtrength in all its parts ; was exceſſively fierce, libidinous, and ſtrong.”</p><p>Mr Schreber ſays, that this ſpecies lives on ſucculent fruits, and on nuts ; is very fond of eggs, and will put eight at once into its pouches, and, taking them out one by one, break them at the end, and ſwallow the yolk and white ; rejects all fleſh-meat, unleſs it be dreſſed ; would drink quantities of wine or brandy ; was leſs agile than other baboons ; very cleanly; for it would immediately fling its excrements out of its hut. That which was ſhown at Cheſter was particularly fond of cheeſe. Its voice was a kind of roar, not unlike that of a lion, but low and ſomewhat inward. It went upon all fours, and never ſtood on its hind legs, unleſs forced by the keeper ; but would frequently fit on its rump in a crouching manner, and drop its arms before the belly. Inhabits the hotter parts of Africa.</p><p>10.	The little baboon, or ſimia papio apedia, has a roundiſh head, with a projecting muzzle, and roundiſh</p><p>naked ears ; the hair on the body is yellow, tipt with black ; the face is brown, and almoſt naked, having only a few ſcattered hairs ; the nails are all compreſſed and oblong, except on the thumbs and great toes, the nails of which reſemble man ; the tail is very ſhort, being hardly an inch long ; the body is about the size of a cat. It is uncertain, ſays Gmelin, if this animal ſhould be conſidered as a diſtinct ſpecies, or only as a variety of the ſimia ſciurea.</p><p>11.	The mantegar, or ſimia papio mermon, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">tufted ape,</hi> but it is improperly named an <hi rend="italic">ape,</hi> as it has a tail. It is deſcribed in the abridgment of the Philoſophical Tranſactions, n⁰ 290. It had a noſe and head 14 inches in length ; the noſe of a deep red, lace blue, both naked ; black eye-brows ; ears like the human ; on the top of the head a long upright tuft of hair ; on the chin another ; two long tuſks in the upper jaw ; fore feet exactly reſembling hands, and the nails  on the fingers flat ; the fore-part of the body, and the inside of the legs and arms, naked ; the outſide covered with mottled brown and olive hair. Length, from the noſe to the rump, three feet two inches. It was very fierce and ſalacious ; went on all fours, but would fit up on its rump, and ſupport itſelf with a ſtick ; in this attitude, it would hold a cup in its hand, and drink out of it. Its food was fruits.</p><p>12. The mandril, ſimia papio maimon, or ribbed noſe baboon, has a ſhort tail, and a thin beard on the chin ; the cheeks are blue and ſtriped, and the buttocks are naked. This ſpecies of baboon is found on the Gold Coaſt, and in the other southern provinces of Africa, where he is called <hi rend="italic">boggo</hi> by the negroes, and <hi rend="italic">mandril </hi>by the Europeans. Next to the orang-outang, he is the largeſt of all the apes or baboons. Smith relates, that he had a preſent of a female mandril, which was only six months old, and that it was as large as an adult baboon. He adds, that theſe mandrils walk always on two feet ; that they weep and groan like men ; that they have a violent paſſion for women, which they never fail to gratify when they find a woman at a diſtance from relief. We have given figures both of the male and female, which may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed by their ſize and appearance.</p><p>13.	The wood-baboon, or ſimia papio sylvatica, with a long dog-like face, covered with a ſmall gloſſy black ſkin ; hands and feet naked, and black like the face ; hair on all parts long, elegantly mottled with black and tawny ; nails white : about three feet high when erect; tail not three inches, and very hairy on the upper top. Inhabits Guinea, where it is called by the Engliſh the <hi rend="italic">man oſ the woοd.</hi></p><p>14.	The brown baboon, or ſimia papio platypygos, with pointed ears; face of a dirty white ; noſe large and broad; hairs round the face ſhort and ſtraight; colour of the upper part of the body brown ; of the under, aſh- colour : tail about four inches long ; taper, and almoſt bare of hair ; beneath is quite naked. The animal which Mr Pennant called the <hi rend="italic">new baboon,</hi> in the firſt edition, ſeems by the taperneſs of the tail, and general form, to be of this kind.</p><p>15.	The hoggiſh baboon, or ſimia papio porcaria, has a ſhort tail, and coloured buttocks ; the head is like that of a hog, with a naked ſnout ; the body is of an olive brown colour ; the nails are ſharp and compreſſed. Inhabits Africa, and is about three feet and a half high</p></body></text></TEI>
