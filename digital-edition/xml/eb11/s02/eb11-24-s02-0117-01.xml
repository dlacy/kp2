                    11; Strabo xvi. 749), called in Arabic literature Sumeisāṭ,<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> Not to be confused, as Yāqūt remarks,
                        with Shamshāṭ the classical Arsamosata (Ptol. v. 13). </note> is now
                    represented by the village of Samsāṭ, occupying a corner of the ancient site. On
                    a broad plain 1500 ft. above sea-level, Samosata practically marks the place
                    where the mountain course of the Euphrates ends (see Mesopotamia). When the
                    water is high enough it is possible to descend in a <hi rend="italic">kelek</hi>
                    in one day to Bîrejik. The rocky banks contain many ancient cave-dwellings.</p>
                <p>The stele found there and published by Humann and Puchstein (<hi rend="italic"
                        >Reisen in Kleinasien u. Nord-Syrien,</hi> Atlas, plate xlix. 1-3) shows
                    that it was at an early time a Hittite centre, probably marking an important
                    route across the Euphrates: whether or not it was the place where later the
                    Persian “ royal road ” crossed the Euphrates, in Strabo’s time it was connected
                    by a bridge with a Seleucia on the Mesopotamian side, and it is now connected by
                    road with Severek and Diarbekr and with Rakka, connecting further, through
                    Edessa and Ḥarrān, with other eastward routes. The Hittite sculptured object
                    referred to above</p>
                <p>shows influences of an Assyrian type (P. Jensen, <hi rend="italic">Hittiter u.
                        Armenier,</hi> 1898,13) ; but no cuneiform text referring to Samosata by
                    name seems yet to have been published. Kummukh, however, the district to which
                    it belonged, was overrun by early Assyrian kings. In consequence of revolt it
                    was made an Assyrian province in 708 b.c. When the Assyrian empire passed
                    through the hands of Babylon and Persia into those of the successors of
                    Alexander, Samosata was the capital of Kummukh, called in Greek Commagene. How
                    soon it became a Greek city we do not know. Although its ruler Ptolemy renounced
                    allegiance to Antiochus IV. the dynasty of Iranian origin which ruled at
                    Samosata, described by Strabo (<hi rend="italic">l.c.</hi>) as a fortified city
                    in a very fertile if not extensive district, allied itself with the Seleucids,
                    and bore the dynastic name of Antiochus. There, not long after the little
                    kingdom was in a.d. 72 made a province by the Romans, and its capital received
                    the additional name of Flavia (Suet. <hi rend="italic">Vesp.</hi> 8; Eutrop. 8.
                    19), the celebrated Greek writer Lucian the Satirist was born in the 2nd century
                    (see LucJan), and more than a century later another Lucian, known as the Martyr,
                    and Paul called “ of Samosata.” The remains of a fine aqueduct that once brought
                    water from the Kiakhta Chai, which begins some 6 m. above the town, are probably
                    of the 3rd century a.d. <hi rend="italic">{Geog. Journ.</hi> viii. 323). Under
                    Constantine Samosata gave place as capital of Euphratensis to Hierapolis (Malal.
                        <hi rend="italic">Chron.</hi> xiii. p. 317). It was at Samosata that Julian
                    had ships made in his expedition against Sapor, and it was a natural
                    crossing-place in the struggle between Heraclius and Chosroes in the 7th
                    century. Mas'ūdi in the 10th century says it was known also as Kal'at aṭ-Tīn (“
                    the Clay Castle ”). It was one of the strong fortresses included in the county
                    of Edessa (<hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi>). In the 13th century, according to
                    Yāqūt, one of its quarters was exclusively inhabited by Armenians. It is now a
                    Kurdish village, which in 1894 consisted of about 100 houses, three of which
                    were Armenian <hi rend="italic">{Geog. Journ.</hi> viii. 322).</p>
