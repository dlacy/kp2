<p><span class="font2">epiphytal, growing on the branches of other trees, but not deriving their sustenance from them. The varieties grown&nbsp;in gardens are mostIy grafted on the Pontic species (72. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ponti-cum)</span><span class="font2"> and the Virginian 72. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Catawbiense.</span><span class="font2"> The common Pontic&nbsp;variety is excellent for game-covert, from its hardiness, the&nbsp;shelter it affords, and the fact that hares and rabbits rarely&nbsp;eat it. Variety of colour has been infused by crossing or&nbsp;hybridizing the species first named, or their derivatives, with&nbsp;some of the more gorgeously coloured Himalayan-American&nbsp;varieties. In many instances this has been done without&nbsp;sacrifice of hardihood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some of the finest hybrids for the open air, especially in favoured spots, are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Qltaclerense</span><span class="font1"> (scarlet); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Harrisi</span><span class="font1"> (rosy crimson); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Kewense&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(rose); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Luscombei</span><span class="font1"> (rose-pink); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Manglesi</span><span class="font1"> (white); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nobleanurn&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(crimson), one of the first to flower after Christmas; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praecox</span><span class="font1"> (rose-purple); and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shilsoni</span><span class="font1"> (crimson). There are almost countless colour&nbsp;variations of these, but one of the most exquisite of late years is that&nbsp;known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pink Pearl<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font1">  with large clear rosy-pink blossoms of great&nbsp;purity. What are termed greenhouse rhododendrons are derivatives&nbsp;from certain Malayan and Javanese species, and are consequently&nbsp;much more tender. They are characterized by the possession of a&nbsp;cylindrical (not funnel-shaped) flower-tube and other marks of&nbsp;distinction. The foliage of rhododendrons contains much tannin,&nbsp;and has been used medicinally. Whether the honey mentioned by&nbsp;Xenophon as poisonous was really derived from plants of this genus&nbsp;as alleged is still an open question.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cultivation.—</span><span class="font1">The hardy evergreen kinds are readily propagated by seed, by layers, and by grafting. Grafting is resorted to only for&nbsp;the propagation of the rarer and more tender kinds. Loamy soil&nbsp;containing a large quantity of peat or vegetable humus is essential,&nbsp;the roots of all the species investigated being associated with a&nbsp;fungus partner </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(rnycorhiza).</span><span class="font1"> An excess of Iime or chalk in the soil&nbsp;proves fatal to rhododendrons and their allies sooner or later—a fact&nbsp;overlooked by many amateurs. The hardy deciduous kinds are&nbsp;valuable for forcing, and withstand cold-storage treatment well.&nbsp;The tender Malayan and Javanese species thrive in warm greenhouse temperature, but are difficult to cultivate where the water is&nbsp;very alkaline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RHODONITE, a member of the pyroxene group of minerals, consisting of manganese metasilicate, MnSiOa, and crystallizing&nbsp;in the anorthic system. It commonly occurs as cleavable to&nbsp;compact masses with a rose-red colour; hence the name, from&nbsp;the Greek </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ρόδον</span><span class="font2"> (a rose). Crystals often have a thick tabular&nbsp;habit; there are perfect cleavages parallel to the prism faces&nbsp;with an ariglè of 87° 31^'. The hardfiess is 5^-6 j, and the&nbsp;specific 'gravity 3-4-3-68. The manganese is often partly&nbsp;replaced by iron and calcium, which may sometimes be present&nbsp;in considerable amounts; a greyish-brown variety containing&nbsp;as much as'20% of calcium oxide is called “bustamite” ;&nbsp;“ fowlerite ” is a zinciferous variety containing 7 % of zinc&nbsp;oxide. Rhodonite is a mineral liable to alteration, with the&nbsp;formation of manganese carbonate, hydrous silicate or oxides.&nbsp;The compact material, which is cut and polished for ornamental&nbsp;purposes, is often marked in a striking manner by veins and&nbsp;patches of these black alteration products. At Syedelnikova,&nbsp;near Ekaterinburg in the Urals, compact material of a good&nbsp;colour occurs in a clay-slate and is extensively quarried: boulders&nbsp;of similar material found at Cummington in Massachusetts&nbsp;(“ cummingtdnite' ”) have also been worked as an ornamental&nbsp;stone. In the iron and manganese mines at Pajsberg near&nbsp;Filipstadt andLângban in Vermland, Sweden, small brilliant and&nbsp;translucent crystals (“ pajsbergite ”) and cleavage masses&nbsp;occur. Fowlerite occurs as large, rough crystals, somewhat&nbsp;resembling pink felspar, with franklinite and zinc ores in granular&nbsp;limestone at Franklin Furnace in New Jersey.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RHOECUS, a Samian sculptor of the 6th century </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.C.</span><span class="font2"> He and his son Theodorus were especially noted for their work in bronze.&nbsp;Herodotus says that Rhoecus built the temple of Hera at Samos.&nbsp;In the temple of Artemis at Ephesus was a marble figure of&nbsp;night by Rhqecus. His name has been found on a fragment of a&nbsp;vase which he dedicated to Aphrodite at 4 Naucratis. His sons&nbsp;Theodorus and Telecles made a statue of the Pythian Apollo&nbsp;for the Samians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RHONDDA (formerly </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ystradyfodwg),</span><span class="font2"> an urban district and parliamentary division of Glamorganshire, South Wales. It&nbsp;is 12 m. long by about 4$ m. across at* its widest part, and&nbsp;comprises two main valleys, named after their respective rivers,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rhondda Fawr (çi m.) and Rhondda Fach, or the lesser (6J m.), running S.E. and S.W. respectively till their junction at Porth,&nbsp;and thence the single valIey for upwards of a mile farther down&nbsp;the boundary of the Pontypridd urban district at Trehafod.&nbsp;The valleys are narrow and tortuous, and their Iateral boundaries&nbsp;are formed by steep hills varying in. height from about 560 ft.&nbsp;on either side of Trehafod to 1340 ft. on the N.E. of Maerdy in&nbsp;the lesser Rhondda and 1742 ft. on the S.W. of Treherbert in the&nbsp;main valley, while the mountains at the upper end of the latter&nbsp;valley culminate in Cam Moesen (1950 ft.). Thetwovalleys are&nbsp;separated by the steep ridge of Cefn-rhondda, which ranges from&nbsp;600 ft. high above Porth to 1690 ft. near the upper end of the&nbsp;district. There are a few tributary valleys of which Cwmparc,&nbsp;Clydach Vale and Cymmer arc the chief. Though the urban&nbsp;district measures 23,884 acres, the area built upon is generally&nbsp;a narrow strip on either side of each river except at Treorky&nbsp;and Ton, where the valley of the Rhondda Fawr opens out a&nbsp;little. In 1877 the ancient parish of Ystradyfodwg (with the&nbsp;omission of the township of Rhigos, which lies beyond the&nbsp;mountains to the north) was formed into an urban district&nbsp;bearing the parish name, the area having previously been part&nbsp;of a rural district under the Pontypridd rural sanitary authority.&nbsp;In October 1879, portions of the parishes of Llanwonno and&nbsp;Llantrisant, comprising over 5000 acres, were added to the urban&nbsp;area, the whole being consolidated in 1894 into one civil parish.&nbsp;In 1897, the name of the urban district was changed into&nbsp;Rhondda. The Taff Vale railway runs up each of the two&nbsp;valleys from a junction at Porth (16 m. N.W. of Cardiff), and has&nbsp;five stations in the main valley and four in the lesser one. From&nbsp;Porth it runs to Pontypridd, whence there is communication&nbsp;with Cardiff, Barry and Newport. The Rhondda and Swansea&nbsp;Bay railway (authorized in 1882, opened in 1890, and now&nbsp;worked by the Great Western) connects the upper end of the&nbsp;main valley, where it has a station, Blaen-rhondda, with Port&nbsp;Talbot, Neath and Swansea (31 m. distant) by means of a line&nbsp;which has a tunnel 3443 yds. long.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The district occupies almost the centre of the eastern division of the South Wales coal-field, and its coal, upon which the&nbsp;inhabitants are almost entirely dependent, is unsurpassed for&nbsp;its steam-raising properties. In common with other East&nbsp;Glamorgan coal it became commercially known as Cardiff coal&nbsp;from the fact that Cardiff was at first its only port of shipment.&nbsp;The development of the Rhondda coaI-field was Iaterin date than&nbsp;those of Aberdare and Merthyr, and it received its chief impetus&nbsp;from the American Civil War. Thus the population of the parish&nbsp;(excluding Rhigos), which was 576 in 1811, 951 in 1851 and&nbsp;3035 in 1861, increased to 16,914 in 1871. When the boundaries of the district were extended in 1879 the population of&nbsp;the enlarged area was calculated by the registrar-general to be&nbsp;23,950 in 1871, but it reached 55,632 in 1881, and 113,735 in&nbsp;1901, showing an increase of 104% in the previous twenty years.&nbsp;In 1901, 35*4% of the population of three years of age and&nbsp;upwards spoke English only, 11-4% spoke Welsh only, the&nbsp;remainder being bilingual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ecclesiastically the parish. of Ystradyfodwg<sub>i</sub> was an ancient chapelry dependent.on Llantrisant. The old parish church at Ton&nbsp;Pentre (in substitution for which a new church was built in 1893-94)&nbsp;served the whole parish till past the middle of the 19th century.&nbsp;Between. 1879 and 1900 the ancient parish (excluding Rhigos) was&nbsp;divided into seven ecclesiastical parishes, the six new ones being&nbsp;Llwyn-y-pia (1879), Tylorstown (1887), Ynyshir (1887), Treherbert&nbsp;(i</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>8</sup>93)» Cwmparc (1898) and Ferndale (1900). The additional area&nbsp;brought into the urban district in 1879 comprises two other&nbsp;ecclesiastical parishes, Cymmer and Porth (1894), and Dinas and&nbsp;Penygraig (1901). These nine parishes, comprised in the urban&nbsp;district, have twenty churches and eighteen mission-rooms, with&nbsp;accommodation for about 12,000 persons. This area, together with&nbsp;Pontypridd, Glyntaff and Llanwonno, form the rural deanery of&nbsp;Rhondda in the archdeaconry and diocese of Llandaff. There were&nbsp;at the end of 1905 over one hundred and fifty nonconformist&nbsp;chapels and mission rooms, with accommodation for over 85,000&nbsp;persons, of which provision nearly two-thirds was in chapels with&nbsp;Welsh services. There is a Roman Catholic church at Tonypandy.&nbsp;The public buildings include the council house and offices of the&nbsp;district council, erected in 1883-84 for the local board at Pentre,&nbsp;libraries and workmen’s institutes at Ystrad (1895), and Cymmer</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
