<p><span class="font4">tertſt to ſubmit to him : or to iιnprefs the whole with a belief that, weak and pitiful as he himielf may appear,&nbsp;when viewed ſingly in oppoſition to them all, yet by tbe&nbsp;aſſiſtance of ſome awful inviſible beings, his friends and&nbsp;protectors, he is ſo powerful, that any attempts to reſiſt his authority muſt prove preſumptuous folly. Here,&nbsp;then, the aid of religion becomes requiſite. Religious&nbsp;fentiments are the moſt happily calculated to ſerve this&nbsp;purpofe. Scarce ever was there a ſociety formed, a&nbsp;inode of government eſtabliihed, or a code oi laws&nbsp;framed and enacted, without having the religious fentiments of mankind, their notions of the exiſtence of fuperior invιhble beings, and their hopes and fears from&nbsp;thoſe beings, as its fundamental principle. Now, we&nbsp;believe, it is almoſt univerſally agreed, that even the&nbsp;rndeſt form of ſociety is more favourable to the happineſs of mankind, and the dignity ot the human character, than a ſolitary and lavage ſtate.. And if this, with&nbsp;what we have afferted concerning religion as the baſis&nbsp;of civil government, be both granted, it will follow,&nbsp;that even the moſt imperfect religious notions, the moſt&nbsp;fooliih and abſurd rites, and the wildeſt ideas that have&nbsp;been entertained concerning the moral government of&nbsp;the univerſe by ſuperior beings, and a future ſtate of&nbsp;retribution, have been more advantageous than atheιfm&nbsp;to the happinefs and virtue of human life, we have already granted, nor can it be denied, indeed, that many&nbsp;of the religious opinions which prevailed among the ancient heathens, did contribute, in ſome degree, to the&nbsp;depravation ©f their morals : and' all that we argue tor&nbsp;is, that on a comparative view oi the evil and the good&nbsp;which reſulted from them, the latter muſt appear more&nbsp;than adequate to counterbalance the effects of the&nbsp;former.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But if ſuch be the natural tendency of thoſe principles by which the human heart is made ſuſceptible of re=∙ ligious fentiments, that even enthuſiaſm and abſurd ſuperſtition are productive of beneficial teffects more than&nbsp;iufficient to counterbalance whatever is malignant in&nbsp;their influence on ſociety finely a pure rational religion, the doctrines of which are founded in undeniable&nbsp;truth, and all the obfervances which it enjoins, calculated to promote by their direct and immediate effects&nbsp;ſome uſeful purpoſes, muſt be in a very high degree&nbsp;conducive to the dignity and the happineſs of human&nbsp;nature. Indeed one collateral prooſ ol the truth of&nbsp;any religion, which muſt have very conſiderable weight&nbsp;with all who are not of opinion that the ſyſtem of the&nbsp;univerſe has been produced and hitherto maintained in&nbsp;order and exiſtence by blind chance, will be its having&nbsp;a ſtronger and more direct tendency than others to promote the intereſts of moral virtue and the happineſs of&nbsp;mankind in the preſent life. Even the teſtimony of&nbsp;thoufands, even miracles, prophecies, and the lanction&nbsp;of remote antiquity, will ſcarce have ſuſſicient weight&nbsp;to perfiιade us, that a religion is of divine origin, </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">it </span><span class="font4">its&nbsp;general tendency appear to be rather unfavourable than&nbsp;advantageous to moral virtue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">III. We ſſiall therefore, in the next place, endeavour to determine, from a comparative view of the effects produced on the character and circumſtances of&nbsp;fociety by the moſt eminent of theſe various ſyſtems of&nbsp;religion which have been in different ages or in different countries eſtabliſſied in the world, how far any&nbsp;cne of them has in this reſpect the advantage over the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">yeſt </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">; and,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> if the </span><span class="font4">utility </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">of a ſyſtem of religion were to</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font4">be received as a teſt of its truth, what particular fyſtem might, with the beſt reaſon, be received as true, while&nbsp;the reſt were rejected.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">iſt,. The principle upon which we here fet out </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">is, </span><span class="font4">that all, or almoft all, fyſtems of religion with which we&nbsp;are acquainted, whether true or falfe, contribute more&nbsp;or leſs to the welfare </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font4">fociety. But as, one field is&nbsp;more fruitful, and one garden leſs overgrown with&nbsp;weeds than another; ſo, in the fame manner, one ſyſtem&nbsp;of religious opinions and ceremonies may be more happily calculated than others to promote the trueſt intereſts of mankind. In oppofition to th∩fe philoſophers&nbsp;who are ſo vehement in their declamations againſt the&nbsp;inequality of ranks, we have ever been of opinion,&nbsp;that refinement and civilization contribute to the hap-pineſs of human life. The character of the ſolitary ſavage is, we are told, more dignified and reſpectabte&nbsp;than that of the philoſopher and the hero, in proportion as he is more independent. He is indeed&nbsp;more independent ; but his independence is that of&nbsp;a ſtone, which receives no nouriſhment from the&nbsp;earth or air, and communicates none to animals or&nbsp;vegetables around it. In point of happineſs, and in&nbsp;point of reſpectability, we cannot hefitate a moment,&nbsp;let philofophers fay what they will, to prefer a virtu-ous<sub>i</sub> enlightened, and poliſhed Briton to any of the&nbsp;rudeſt ſavages, the leaſt acquainted with tbe reſtraints&nbsp;and the ſympathies of ſocial life, that wander through&nbsp;the wild foreſts of the weſtern world. But if we prefer civilization to barbariſm, we muſt admit, that in&nbsp;this view Chriſtianity has the advantage over every&nbsp;other religious ſyſtem which has in any age or country&nbsp;prevailed among men ; for nowhere has civilization and&nbsp;uſeful ſcicnce been carried to ſuch a height as among&nbsp;Chriſtians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">It is not, indeed, in any confiderable degree that the abſurd ſuperſtitions of thole rude tribes, who can lcarce&nbsp;be laid to be formed into any regular ſociety, can contribute to their happineſs. Among them the faculty&nbsp;ol reaſon is but in a very low ſtate; and the moral principle uſually follows the improvement or the depreſſion&nbsp;ol the reaſoning faculty. Their appetites and merely&nbsp;animal paſſions are almoſt their only principles ot action : their firſt religious notions, if we ſuppoſe them,&nbsp;not to be derived from revelation or tradition, are produced by the operation of gratitude, or grief, or hope,,&nbsp;or fear, upon their imaginations. And to theſe, however&nbsp;wild aud fanciful, it is not improbable that they may&nbsp;owe fome of their earlieſt moral notions. The idea of&nbsp;ſuperior powers naturally leads to the thought that&nbsp;thofe powers have ſome influence on human life, from&nbsp;this they will moſt probably proceed to fancy one fet&nbsp;of actions agreeable, another offenſive, to thoſe beings&nbsp;to whom they believe themſelves ſubject. And this,,&nbsp;perhaps, is the ſirſt diſtinction that favages can be ſup-pofed to form between actions, as right or wrong, to&nbsp;be performed or to be avoided. But if this be the&nbsp;eaſe, we muſt acknowledge that the religious notions&nbsp;of the ſavage, however abſurd, contribute to elevate&nbsp;his character, and to improve his happineſs, when,&nbsp;they call forth the moral principle implanted in his&nbsp;breaſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">But iſ the ſocial ſtate be preferable to a ſtate of wild, and ſolitary independence, even the rude fuperſtitions of&nbsp;unenlightened tribes of favages are in another reſpect&nbsp;beneficial </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font4">thole among whom they prevail.
