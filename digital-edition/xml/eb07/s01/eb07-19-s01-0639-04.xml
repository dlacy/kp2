a town of the county of Kent, in the hundred of Eastry, and lathe of St Augustine, sixty-eight miles from London. It is situated on the river Stour, two miles from its entrance into the sea. It was once accessible by ships, but the sand has nearly choked the passage, though some plans are at present in contemplation to improve it. It is one of the Cinque Ports, and as such, is governed by a corporation composed of a mayor, four aldermen, and eleven councillors, who have jurisdiction over Deal, Fordwich, Ramsgate, Reculver, Sarre, Stower, and Walmer. It was once fortified, and a portion of its walls is still standing. Sandown Castle, a strong fortress within the parish, commands the anchorage of the Downs. It is rather a decayed town, but has a market on Wednesday and Saturday. There are three established churches, and also places of worship for dissenters. It returns two members to parliament, and confers on the family of Montague the title of earl. The population amounted in 1821 to 2912, and in 1831 to 3136.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sandwich,</hi> an island in the Eastern Seas, opposite to the island of New Ireland.
