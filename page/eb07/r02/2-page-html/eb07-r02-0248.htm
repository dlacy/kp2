<p><span class="font2">cussion is therefore the point at which, if an obstacle were opposed sufficient to resist tlle rotation of the system,&nbsp;no motion would be communicated to the axis ; or, which is&nbsp;the same thing, if the axis were not fixed, the system would&nbsp;acquire from the shock no tendency to turn, the effect being the same as if the whole rotatory effort had been accumulated at that point.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let HKL (fig. 8) be a section of the body perpendicular to the axis, and containing the centre of&nbsp;gravity G. Let O be the axis, and in the&nbsp;line OG take OP = </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h = fridm</span><span class="font2"> +- M∙OG,&nbsp;then P is the centre of percussion, and a&nbsp;force applied at P, in the plane HKL, and&nbsp;in the direction perpendicular to OP, will&nbsp;produce the same initial velocity of the&nbsp;centre of gravity G as if the body were&nbsp;free ; for as the force exerts no pressure&nbsp;on the axis or points of support, the initial&nbsp;velocity will be the same as if they were not there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">35. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distance of the centre of percussion from the&nbsp;axis is always greater than the distance of the centre of&nbsp;gravity from the axis ; for the moment of inertia in respect&nbsp;of the axis passing through O being </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm,</span><span class="font2"> by (17) the moment of inertia in respect of the parallel axis passing through&nbsp;G is/</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ridm —</span><span class="font2"> M∙OG<sup>2</sup> ; therefore, since the moment of inertia is necessarily positive, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm</span><span class="font2"> M∙OG<sup>s</sup>. But by the&nbsp;definition </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm</span><span class="font2"> = M∙OG∙OP, therefore M∙OG∙GP tx.&nbsp;M∙OG<sup>a</sup>, or OP OG.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">36. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The property of the centre of percussion, that a force&nbsp;applied there produces no strain on the axis, may be rendered sensible by a simple experiment. If a straight line,&nbsp;or rod of uniform thickness, be suspended from one extremity, the centre of percussion is at the distance of two thirds&nbsp;of its length from the axis ; for the centre of gravity being&nbsp;at the middle of the line, OG = ½, so that if we call its mass&nbsp;M = 1, the formula OP = ∕r<sup>2</sup>dm+-M∙OG becomes OP&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">= 2fridx,</span><span class="font2"> which, on taking the integral from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x =</span><span class="font2"> 0 to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">χ = l,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">gives GP = 'j∕∙ Now if the rod be held in the hand, and we&nbsp;give it a motion round the joint of the wrist only, and strike&nbsp;smartly against an obstacle with a point considerably nearer&nbsp;or more remote than two thirds of its length, we feel a painful shock or wrench in the hand ; but if we strike with that&nbsp;point which is exactly at two thirds of its length, we feel no&nbsp;such disagreeable strain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">37. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is sometimes said that the point P, considered as&nbsp;the centre of percussion, is that with which the most violent&nbsp;blow is struck. But this is by no means true. P is that&nbsp;point of a body turning round O which gives a blow precisely equal to the progressive motion of thc body, and in&nbsp;the same direction. As we have already said, it is the point&nbsp;where we may suppose the whole rotatory momentum of&nbsp;the body accumulated. Every particle of the body is moving in a particular direction, with a velocity proportional to&nbsp;its distance from the axis of rotation ; and if the body were&nbsp;stopped in any point, each particle tending to continue its&nbsp;motion endeavours to drag the rest along with it. Whatever point we call the centre of percussion should have this&nbsp;property, that when it is stopped by a sufficient force, the&nbsp;whole motion and tendency to motion of every kind should&nbsp;be stopped ; so that if at that instant the supports of tlle&nbsp;axis were annihilated, the body would remain in absolute&nbsp;rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">38. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The expressions in (29) for the stress on the axis&nbsp;have reference only to the initial movement of the body,&nbsp;and the forces which they represent are soon destroyed by&nbsp;the resistance of the axis. But when a body is in permanent rotation about a fixed axis, there is a strain exerted on&nbsp;the axis which depends only upon the centrifugal force of&nbsp;rotation, and which therefore continues as long as the rotation continues. This constant pressure is determined as&nbsp;follows : Since </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font2"> is the angular velocity, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font2"> the distance</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">of a particle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dm</span><span class="font2"> from the axis, the velocity of the particle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">= rw;</span><span class="font2"> and, by mechanics, the centrifugal force of a body&nbsp;moving in a circle is proportional to the square of the velocity divided by the radius ; therefore the centrifugal force&nbsp;of the particle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">dm,</span><span class="font2"> in the direction of the radius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r,</span><span class="font2"> is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w<sup>i</sup>rdrn.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The resolved parts of this force in the directions OX and&nbsp;O Y (fig. 7) are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">w<sup>1</sup>xdm</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">uriydm ;</span><span class="font2"> therefore, denoting the&nbsp;pressures in those directions on the pivot S by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and those on the pivot T by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p'</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q',</span><span class="font2"> we shall have, as in&nbsp;(29), the following equations (in which x<sub>1</sub> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">y<sub>λ</sub></span><span class="font2"> are the&nbsp;co-ordinates of the centre of gravity, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h, h'</span><span class="font2"> the distances&nbsp;of the pivots S and T respectively from O) to determine&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p, p∕, q, f,</span><span class="font2"> viz.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">If we suppose OZ to be one of the three principal axes passing through O, then </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(22) fxzdm</span><span class="font2"> = 0 and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fyzdm —</span><span class="font2"> 0 ;&nbsp;whence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pk + pfhf</span><span class="font2"> = 0, </span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2">y∕&lt; + </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tfhf</span><span class="font2"> = 0. If, therefore, we&nbsp;further suppose </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">k</span><span class="font2"> = 0, or that the origin of the co-ordinates&nbsp;is placed at S, we shall also have </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p∕</span><span class="font2"> = 0, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ff</span><span class="font2"> = 0, whence&nbsp;the pivot T sustains no pressure, the whole being exerted&nbsp;on S.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The forces thus determined are in some sort the inverse of those arising from the percussions found in (29), the&nbsp;values of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p + pf</span><span class="font2"> being in this case expressed in terms of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">x,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and in the former in terms of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">y ;</span><span class="font2"> and the value of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q + ff,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which in the case of the percussions was expressed in terms&nbsp;of .r, is here given in terms of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">y.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">39. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In computing the effect of machines, it is often convenient to determine the situation of a point in which the&nbsp;whole mass of the machine might be concentrated without&nbsp;altering the rotatory effort. In the straight line OG (fig. 8)&nbsp;suppose a point Qto be taken, such that OQ<sup>2</sup> = </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm =</span><span class="font2"> moment of inertia in respect of the axis O ; then, if the whole&nbsp;matter in the body were collected at Q, a force applied at&nbsp;any point P in the line OG, would produce exactly the same&nbsp;angular velocity as if applied to the same point of the body&nbsp;having its natural form. For if the whole mass M were&nbsp;concentrated at Q, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">tlle </span><span class="font2">moment of inertia would become&nbsp;M∙OQ<sup>,</sup> (13), and thc moment of the force F applied at P&nbsp;is FOP; therefore the angular velocity (14) would be</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">F∙OP</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">therefore, since M∙0Q<sup>,</sup> = </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm,</span><span class="font2"> the two expressions are equal, and the angular velocity is not altered hy supposing&nbsp;the whole mass concentrated at Q.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point Q is called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">centre of gyration</span><span class="font2"> of the&nbsp;revolving mass; and since OQ = √</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm</span><span class="font2"> +- M, its distance&nbsp;from the axis O is found by extracting the square root of&nbsp;the quotient which is obtained by dividing the moment of&nbsp;inertia by the mass of the body. It is also connected with&nbsp;the centres of gravity and percussion by a simple relation.&nbsp;Suppose P to be the centre of percussion, then (34) OP&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">= fridm</span><span class="font2"> +∙ M ∙ OG, therefore OG ∙ OP = </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm</span><span class="font2"> +■ M =&nbsp;OQ<sup>s</sup> ; whence the distance of the centre of gyration from&nbsp;the axis of rotation is a mean proportional between the distances of the centre of gravity and percussion from the axis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In a straight line or slender rod, as a working beam, or the spoke of a wheel in a machine, OQ is √¼ of its length ;&nbsp;for in this case </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fridm = fridr = </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">⅙</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"> ri ;</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font2"> being the&nbsp;whole length, M = </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">r:</span><span class="font2"> therefore </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vf ridm</span><span class="font2"> -+ M = r </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">V ⅜<sup>,</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
