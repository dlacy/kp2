<p><span class="font0"> little affected by this. The rails are much too light and want <sup>,</sup> depth, and their shape should be the subject of properly&nbsp;conducted experiments. The guage being retained, all&nbsp;the necessary information relative to its efficiency and economy, will, no doubt, in time be made known. The question of longitudinal or transverse bearings is of much less&nbsp;import than is generally imagined. The part of the line&nbsp;on piles between London and Maidenhead, twenty-three&nbsp;miles, if it be retained and kept in good order, will soon set&nbsp;at rest the question of expense in maintaining the way.&nbsp;Thus, then, so far as the public are concerned, all is well ;&nbsp;but the effect of this decision on the interests of the proprietors has received no light whatever ; there is nothing&nbsp;even to shew that in adopting a heavier rail, there is the&nbsp;slightest necessity also to adopt a greater scantling of timber ; and it is extraordinary that a point so easily submitted to experiment and calculation, should have been en</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tirely passed by in the final report to the proprietors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We have hitherto looked principally to the construction</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of a railway ; there is, however, an equally important point to be considered, and that is, the working of it after it has&nbsp;been constructed. On this will mainly hinge the degree&nbsp;of profit which may be expected ; for, let all our previous&nbsp;instructions be duly considered and properly followed out,&nbsp;with such deviations only as may be rendered necessary&nbsp;by local circumstances ; or let a railway be constructed in&nbsp;the best and most advantageous manner, yet it will soon&nbsp;be discovered that, if it is not worked on a sound and effective system, it will turn out a vastly different speculation&nbsp;to what it would be under proper management-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For this purpose every thing should centre in one committee of directors ; these may with advantage subdivide themselves into smaller bodies, for particular purposes ; all&nbsp;business transacted by these subdivisions being merely preparatory, and nothing being finally concluded till brought&nbsp;before the general body. There should be no boards of&nbsp;direction at each end of a line, but that terminus which is&nbsp;best situated to effectually overlook the whole of the various business, should be made choice of for the seat of&nbsp;government. There should be ample inspection into every&nbsp;department, but it should be inspection only ; all orders&nbsp;should come from one committee, and through one general head. It may often happen, and always with advantage, that both ends of a railway may be opened before&nbsp;the middle is finished ; still every thing should centre at&nbsp;the governing end of the line, at one point ; and the mode&nbsp;by which this government should be carried on, must now&nbsp;be considered a little more at large.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first question which arises is, by what system can a joint stock company be so managed as to obtain the same&nbsp;amount of alacrity, vigilance, and industry in its service, as&nbsp;characterises the conduct of individuals when acting for&nbsp;themselves, and to combine with these qualities an honest&nbsp;and economical administration. The system of management by boards of directors has stood the test of considerable experience, and, where the proper men are found for&nbsp;directors, this system is admiraoly adapted to answer the&nbsp;primary object of a board, viz. to deliberate and decide on&nbsp;principles. More information and greater variety of view&nbsp;is brought to bear upon a subject when it is discussed by&nbsp;several men, than almost any individual intellect could furnish ; and, as joint-stock companies consist of persons in&nbsp;almost all classes of society, a board composed, as it should&nbsp;be, of individuals holding a large amount of stock, and giving their services gratuitously, for that reason, as well as&nbsp;from a sense of public duty, by embodying various interests, claims and secures the confidence of all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is well known, however, that a body consisting of many individuals is utterly unfitted for executive functions. It is&nbsp;admitted as a principle, that executive administration is best&nbsp;and most efficiently exercised by one and one only, and,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">accordingly, every board, whether of government commissioners, or of joint-stock companies, or of charitable institutions, has some one to whom is entrusted the executive superintendence, and control of that, whatever it be, on&nbsp;which the board exercises its legislative and judicial functions. Connected with this executive are other officers,&nbsp;many or few, exercising a separate jurisdiction over their&nbsp;several departments, and in all details independent, yet&nbsp;held together, for the purposes of combination, by the executive officer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the management of railways, such an officer is more especially required where the heads of departments are&nbsp;necessarily numerous, in consequence of the several branches of business into which the working of a railway is divided ; where each department employs a considerable number of men, two alone, those of the police and porters,&nbsp;amounting almost to a regiment, and where all are to be&nbsp;brought to act with the precision and regularity of a steam&nbsp;engine. It would be impossible to produce unity of action&nbsp;amidst such conflicting elements, without a close, active,&nbsp;and unremitting personal superintendence, such as may be&nbsp;accomplished by an individual, but can never be effected&nbsp;by a board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Several attempts at a different system of management have been made by railway companies, but they have not&nbsp;been found to answer. A favourite project has been much&nbsp;talked of lately, viz. that a committee of three should be&nbsp;chosen from the body of the directors, in which triumvirate should reside all administrative and executive functions,&nbsp;and so much of the deliberative and judicial as relates to&nbsp;the ordinary affairs of the company, and that each triumvir&nbsp;should receive a salary sufficient to command his whole time&nbsp;for the company’s service, the chairman receiving a higher&nbsp;remuneration than his colleagues. The advocates of this&nbsp;plan contend, that it would first secure unity of action in&nbsp;the principles of management, with prompt execution in&nbsp;the details, a ready redress of grievances, and remedy, or&nbsp;rather prevention of abuses. Secondly, that it would give&nbsp;the personal responsibility of a few to the proprietors, in&nbsp;place of the collective responsibility of many ; and, thirdly,&nbsp;that it would keep in check the undue power and influence&nbsp;which, under a different system, the executive officers would&nbsp;be likely to acquire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This view appears more plausible than sound, more specious than solid. In the first place, the triumvirate would monopolize the whole power of the company, and the board&nbsp;would go to sleep. The board of which the triumvirate form&nbsp;a part, would meet too seldom and know too little, to be </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">match for three men, who would act together every day&nbsp;and know every thing, and who, above all, would enter into&nbsp;debate with the larger body, and vote as directors upon&nbsp;questions affecting their own conduct. It has always proved&nbsp;a thoroughly vicious system to have an executive officer a&nbsp;member (as in many boards he is) of that body, whose orders he is to execute, and to whom he ought to be responsible ; and this applies to the triumvirate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the second place, the responsibility of each triumvir would merge in the collective responsibility of the whole&nbsp;board, and men would be exercising a power for which,&nbsp;practically, they could not be called to an account ; for,&nbsp;when the board had confirmed an act of the triumvirate,&nbsp;what chance would the proprietors have to make them accountable ? The results of irresponsible authority, it is&nbsp;well known, are jobbing and every sort of peculation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the third place, it is not likely that three men chosen out of a body of directors, would be the men best fitted for&nbsp;the situations contemplated. Not only is the number out&nbsp;of which they would be chosen too few to present sufficient&nbsp;of the peculiar ability required, but the selection of the individuals would be rather determined by personal predilections than by their fitness. It would be an appointment to</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
