<p><span class="font0">The growing discontent of the poor people, whether in country or town, is clearly traceable in Germany during the 15th century,&nbsp;and revolutionary agitation was chronic in southern&nbsp;Germany at least during the first two decades of the&nbsp;16th. The clergy were satirized and denounced in&nbsp;popular pamphlets and songs. The tithe was an&nbsp;oppressive form of taxation, as were the various fees&nbsp;demanded for the performance of the sacraments. The&nbsp;so-called “ Reformation of Sigismund,” drawn up in 1438, had&nbsp;demanded that the celibacy of the clergy should be abandoned&nbsp;and their excessive wealth reduced. “It is a shame which&nbsp;cries to heaven, this oppression by tithes, dues, penalties,&nbsp;excommunication, and tolls of the peasant, on whose labour&nbsp;all men depend for their existence.” In 1476 a poor young&nbsp;shepherd drew thousands to Nicklashausen to hear him denounce&nbsp;the emperor as a rascal and the pope as a worthless fellow, and&nbsp;urge the division of the Church’s property among the members&nbsp;of the community. The “ parsons ” must be killed, and the&nbsp;lords reduced to earn their bread by daily labour. An apocalyptic&nbsp; pamphlet of 1508 shows on its cover the Church upside&nbsp;down, with the peasant performing the services, while the&nbsp;priest guides the plough outside and a monk drives the horses.&nbsp;Doubtless the free peasants of Switzerland contributed to&nbsp;stimulate disorder and discontent, especially in southern&nbsp;Germany. The conspiracies were repeatedly betrayed and the&nbsp;guilty parties terribly punished. That discovered in 1517 made&nbsp;a deep impression on the authorities by reason of its vast&nbsp;extent, and doubtless led the diet of Augsburg to allude to&nbsp;the danger which lay in the refusal of the common man to&nbsp;pay the ecclesiastical taxes. “ It was into this mass of seething&nbsp;discontent that the spark of religious protest fell—the one&nbsp;thing needed to fire the train and kindle the social conflagration.&nbsp;This was the society to which Luther spoke, and its discontent&nbsp;was the sounding board which made his words reverberate.” @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On turning from the attitude of the peasants and poorer townspeople to that of the scholars, we find in their writings&nbsp;a good deal of harsh criticism of the scholastic theology,&nbsp;satirical allusions to the friars, and, in Germany, sharp&nbsp;denunciations of the practices of the Curia. But there&nbsp;are many reasons for believing that the older estimate&nbsp;of the influence of the so-called Renaissance, or “ new learning,”&nbsp;in promoting the Protestant revolt was an exaggerated one.&nbsp;The class of humanists which had grown up in Italy during the&nbsp;15th century, and whose influence had been spreading into&nbsp;Germany, France and England during the generation immediately&nbsp; preceding the opening of the Protestant revolt, represented&nbsp; every phase of religious feeling from mystic piety to&nbsp;cynical indifference, but there were very few anti-clericals&nbsp;among them. The revival of Greek from the time of Chrysoloras onward, instead of begetting a Hellenistic spirit, transported&nbsp; the more serious-minded to the nebulous shores of Neo-Platonism, while the less devout became absorbed in scholarly&nbsp;or literary ambitions, translations, elegantly phrased letters,&nbsp;clever epigrams or indiscriminate invective. It is true that&nbsp;Lorenzo Valla (d. 1457) showed the Donation of Constantine&nbsp;to be a forgery, denied that Dionysius the Areopagite wrote&nbsp;the works ascribed to him, and refuted the commonly accepted&nbsp;notion that each of the apostles had contributed a sentence&nbsp;to the Apostles’ Creed. But such attacks were rare and isolated&nbsp;and were not intended to effect a breach in the solid ramparts&nbsp;of the medieval Church, but rather to exhibit the ingenuity of&nbsp;the critic. In the libraries collected under humanistic influences&nbsp;the patristic writers, both Latin and Greek, and the scholastic&nbsp;doctors are conspicuous. Then most of the humanists&nbsp;were clerics, and in Italy they enjoyed the patronage of the&nbsp;popes. They not unnaturally showed a tolerant spirit on the&nbsp;whole toward existing institutions, including the ecclesiastical&nbsp;abuses, and, in general, cared little how long the vulgar herd&nbsp;was left in the superstitious darkness which befitted their estate,&nbsp;so long as the superior man was permitted to hold discreetly&nbsp;any views he pleased. Of this attitude Mutian (1471-1526),</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">the German humanist who perhaps approached most nearly the Italian type, furnishes a good illustration. He believed&nbsp;that Christianity had existed from all eternity, and that the&nbsp;Greeks and Romans, sharing in God’s truth, would share also in&nbsp;the celestial joys. Forms and ceremonies should only be&nbsp;judged as they promoted the great object of life, a clean heart&nbsp;and a right spirit, love to God and one’s neighbour. He defined&nbsp;faith as commonly understood to mean “ not the conformity&nbsp;of what we say with fact, but an opinion upon divine things&nbsp;founded upon credulity which seeks after profit.” “ With&nbsp;the cross,” he declares, “ we put our foes to flight, we extort&nbsp;money, we consecrate God, we shake hell, we work miracles.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These reflections were, however, for his intimate friends, and like him, his much greater contemporary, Erasmus, abhorred&nbsp;anything suggesting open revolt or revolution. The&nbsp;extraordinary popularity of Erasmus is a sufficient&nbsp;indication that his attitude of mind was viewed with&nbsp;sympathy by the learned, whether in France, England, Germany,&nbsp;Spain or Italy. He was a firm believer in the efficacy of culture.&nbsp;He maintained that old prejudices would disappear with the&nbsp;progress of knowledge, and that superstition and mechanical&nbsp;devices of salvation would be insensibly abandoned. The laity&nbsp;should read their New Testament, and would in this way come&nbsp;to feel the true significance of Christ’s life and teachings, which,&nbsp;rather than the Church, formed the centre of Erasmus’s religion.&nbsp;The dissidence of dissent, however, filled him with uneasiness, and&nbsp;he abhorred Luther’s denial of free will and his exaggerated notion&nbsp;of man’s utter depravity; in short, he did nothing whatever to&nbsp;promote the Protestant revolt, except so far as his frank denunciation&nbsp; and his witty arraignment of clerical and monastic weaknesses&nbsp;and soulless ceremonial, especially in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Praise of Folly</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Colloquies,</span><span class="font0"> contributed to bring the faults of the Church into strong&nbsp;relief, and in so far as his edition of the New Testament furnished&nbsp;a simple escape from innumerable theological complications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A peculiar literary feud in Germany served, about 1515, to throw into sharp contrast the humanistic party, which had&nbsp;been gradually developing during the previous fifty years, and&nbsp;the conservative, monkish, scholastic group, who found their&nbsp;leader among the Dominicans of the university of Cologne.&nbsp;Johann Reuchlin, a well-known scholar, who had been charged&nbsp;by the Dominicans with heresy, not only received the support&nbsp;of the newer type of scholars, who wrote him encouraging&nbsp;letters which he published under the title </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epistolae clarorum&nbsp;virorum,</span><span class="font0"> but this collection suggested to Crotus Rubianus and&nbsp;Ulrich von Hutten one of the most successful satires of the ages,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epistolae obscurorîím virorum.</span><span class="font0"> As Creighton well said, the&nbsp;chief importance of the “ Letters of Obscure Men ” lay in its&nbsp;success in popularizing the conception of a stupid party which&nbsp;was opposed to the party of progress. At the same time that&nbsp;the Neo-Platonists, like Ficino and Pico de la Mirandola, and&nbsp;the pantheists, whose God was little more than a reverential&nbsp;conception of the universe at large, and the purely worldly&nbsp;humanists, like Celtes and Bebel, were widely diverging each&nbsp;by his own particular path from the ecclesiastical </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Weltanschauung</span><span class="font0"> of the middle ages, Ulrich von Hutten was busy attacking the&nbsp;Curia in his witty </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dialogues,</span><span class="font0"> in the name of German patriotism.&nbsp;He, at least, among the well-known scholars eagerly espoused&nbsp;Luther’s cause, as he understood it. A few of the humanists&nbsp;became Protestants—Melanchthon, Bucer, Oecolampadius and&nbsp;others—but the great majority of them, even if attracted for the&nbsp;moment by Luther’s denunciation of scholasticism, speedily&nbsp;repudiated the movement. In Socinianism (see below) we have&nbsp;perhaps the only instance of humanistic antecedents leading to&nbsp;the formation of a religious sect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A new type of theology made its appearance at the opening of the 16th century, in sharp contrast with the Aristotelian&nbsp;scholasticism of the Thomists and Scotists. This was&nbsp;due to the renewed enthusiasm for, and appreciation of,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">St Paul with which Erasmus sympathized, and which found an able exponent in England in John Colet and&nbsp;in France in Lefèvre of Étaples (Faber Stapulensis).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Luther was reaching somewhat similar views at the same time,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
