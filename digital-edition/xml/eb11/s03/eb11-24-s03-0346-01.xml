                <p><label>SCHOLAR, SCHOLARSHIP</label>. The term “scholar,” primarily meaning a “
                    learner,” is secondarily applied to one who has thoroughly learnt all that “ the
                    school ” can teach him, one who by early training and constant self-culture has
                    attained a certain maturity in precise and accurate knowledge. Hence the term “
                    scholarship ” in the sense of the knowledge or method of a scholar. Similarly “
                    classical scholarship ” may be defined as the sum of the mental attainments of a
                    classical scholar. Scholarship is sometimes identified with classical <hi
                        rend="italic">learning</hi> or erudition; it is more often contrasted with
                    it. The contrast is thus drawn by Donaldson in his <hi rend="italic">Classical
                        Scholarship and Classical Learning</hi> (1856), and by Mark Pattison, in his
                        <hi rend="italic">Essay on Oxford Studies</hi> (1855). “ I maintain," says
                    Donaldson, “ that not all learned men are accomplished scholars, though any
                    accomplished scholar may, if he chooses to devote the time to the necessary
                    studies, become a learned man ” (p. 149). “ It is not a know-ledge,” writes Mark
                    Pattison, “ but a discipline, that is required; not science, but the scientific
                    habit; not erudition, but scholarship ” <hi rend="italic">(Essays,</hi> i.
                    42s).</p>
                <p>The expression “ a scholarship ” is also used in England for a money payment made
                    by a school, college or university, as a prize (either for one year or a series
                    of years) to the successful competitors at an examination at which one or more
                    such scholarship are to be awarded; and the successful candidate is called a “
                    scholar,” as the holder of a “ scholarship.” In this sense the word is almost
                    synonymous with “ an exhibition,” but the latter is usually considered inferior
                    in merit and dignity, if not in amount. *</p>
