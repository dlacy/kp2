<p><span class="font0">The work, however, has been exceedingly ſucceſsful, and juſtly ſo ; and its ſucceſs encouraged its author to&nbsp;undertake another work of equal uſe and entertainment ;&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hillc&gt;ire Ancienne,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. or “ Ancient Hiſtory of the E-gyptians, Carthaginians, Aſſyrians, Babylonians, Medes&nbsp;and Perſians, Macedonians, and Greeks,” which he fi-niſhed in 13 vols 8vo. and publiſhed between 1730 and&nbsp;1738. M. Voltaire, after having obſerved that Rollin&nbsp;was “ the firſt member of the univerſity of Paris who&nbsp;wrote French with dignity and correctneſs,” ſays of&nbsp;this work, that “ though the laſt volumes, which were&nbsp;written in too great a hurry, are not equal to the firſt,&nbsp;it is nevertheless the heft compilation that has yet appeared in any language ; becauſe it is ſeldom that compilers are eloquent, and Rollin was remarkably ſo.”&nbsp;This is perhaps ſaying too much. There are indeed&nbsp;in this work ſome paſſages very well handled ; but they&nbsp;are only ſuch as he had taken from the ancient authors,&nbsp;in doing juſtice to whom he was always very happy.&nbsp;The reader will eaſily diſcover in this work the lame&nbsp;attachment to religion, the ſame deſire for the public&nbsp;good, and the ſame love of virtue, which appears in that&nbsp;on the Belles Lettres. But it is to be lamented that&nbsp;his chronology is neither exact nor correſponding ; that&nbsp;he ſtates facts inaccurately ; that he has not ſufficiently&nbsp;examined the exaggerations of ancient hiſtorians ; that&nbsp;he often interrupts the moſt ſolemn narrations with mere&nbsp;trifles ; that his ſtyle is not uniform ; and this want oſ&nbsp;uniformity ariſes from his borrowing from writers of a&nbsp;modern date 43 or 50 pages at a time. Nothing can&nbsp;be more noble and more reſined than his reflections; but&nbsp;they are ſtrewed with too ſparing a hand, and want that&nbsp;lively and laconic turn ort account of which the hiſtorians of antiquity are read with ſo much pleaſure. He&nbsp;tranſgreſſes the rule which he himſelf had eſtabliſhed in&nbsp;his Treatiſe on Studies. “ The precepts which have a&nbsp;reſpect to manners (ſays he) ought, in order to make&nbsp;an impreſſion, to be ſhort and lively, and pointed like a&nbsp;dart. That is the moſt certain method of making them enter and remain on the mind.” There is&nbsp;a viſible negligence in his diction with regard to grammatical cuſtom, and the choice of his expreſſions, which&nbsp;he does not chooſe at all times with ſufficient taſte, although, on the whole, he writes well, and has preſerved&nbsp;himſelf free from many of the faults of modern authors.&nbsp;While the laſt volumes of his ancient hiſtory were printing, he publiſhed the firſt of his Roman Hiſtory; which&nbsp;he lived to carry on, through the eighth and into part&nbsp;of the ninth, to the war againſt the Cimbri, about 70&nbsp;years before the battle of Actium. Mr Crevier, the&nbsp;worthy diſciple of Rollin, continued the hiſtory to the&nbsp;battle of Actium, which cloſes the tenth volume ; and&nbsp;has ſince completed the original plan of Rollin in 16&nbsp;vols I2mo, which was to bring it down from the foundation of the city to the reign of Conſtantinc the Great.&nbsp;This hiſtory had not ſo great ſucceſs as his Ancient&nbsp;Hiſtory had. Indeed it is rather a moral and hiſtorical&nbsp;diſcourſe than a formal hiſtory ; for the author does&nbsp;little more than point out ſome more remarkable events,&nbsp;while he dwells with a ſort of prolixity on thoſe parts&nbsp;which furniſh him a free field for moralizing. It is alternately diffuſe and barren ; and the greateſt advantage&nbsp;of the work is, that there are ſeveral paſſage» from T.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">Livy tranſlated with great elegance into Frecch, He alſo publiſhed A Latin Tranſlation of moſt of the Theological Writings relative to the diſputes of the Time«&nbsp;in which he lived. Rollin was one of the moſt zealous&nbsp;adherents of deacon Paris ; and before the iιιclofαre of&nbsp;the cemetery of St Medard, this diſtinguiſhed character&nbsp;might have been often ſeen praying at the foot of his&nbsp;tomb. This he confeſſes in his Letters. He publiſhed alſo Leſſer Pieces ; containing different Letters,&nbsp;Latin Harangues, Diſcourſes, Complimentary Addreſſes,&nbsp;&amp;c. Paris 1771, 2 vols. 12mo. A collection which&nbsp;might have been contained in one volume, by keeping&nbsp;in only the beſt pieces. It is notwithſtanding valuable&nbsp;for ſome good pieces which it contains, for the favourable opinion which it exhibits of ſolid probity, found&nbsp;reaſon, and the zeal of the author ſor the progreſs of&nbsp;virtue and the preſervr.tion of taſte. The Latin of&nbsp;RoUin is very correct, and much after the Ciceronian&nbsp;ſtyle, and embelliſhed with moſt judicious thoughts and&nbsp;agreeable images. Full of the reading of the ancients,,&nbsp;from which he brought quotations with as much propriety as plenty’, he expreſſed himſelf with much ſpirit&nbsp;and excellence. His Latin poems deſerve the ſame eulo-gium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This excellent perſon died in 1741. He had been named by the king a member of the academy of in-ſcriptions and belles lettres in 1701 : but as he had&nbsp;not then brought the college of Beauvais into repute,&nbsp;and found he had more buſineſs upon his hands than&nbsp;was conſiſtent with a decent attendance upon the functions of an academician, he begged the privileges of a&nbsp;veteran, which were honourably granted him. Nevertheleſs, he maintained his connections with the academy, attended their aſſemblies as often as he could,&nbsp;laid the plan of his ancient hiſtory before them, and demanded an academician for his cenſor. Rollin was a&nbsp;man of an admirable compoſition ; very ingenious, conſummate in polite learning, of rigid morals, and eminently pious. He was rather too religious; his religion&nbsp;carrying him into the territories of ſuperſtition ; and he&nbsp;wanted nothing but a mixture of the philoſophic in his&nbsp;nature to make him a very perfect character. Nothing&nbsp;could be more benign, more pacific, more ſweet, more&nbsp;moderate, than Rollin’s temper. He ſhowed, it muſt&nbsp;be owned, ſome zeal ſor the cauſe of Janſeniſm ; but in&nbsp;all other reſpects he was exceedingly moderate. The&nbsp;celebrated poet Rouſſeau conceived ſuch a veneration&nbsp;for him, that he came out of baniſhment incognito to&nbsp;Paris, on purpoſe to viſit him and pay his reſpects to him.&nbsp;He looked upon his hiſtories, not only as the beſt models of the hiſtoric kind, but as a complete ſyſtem of&nbsp;politics and morals, and a moſt inſtructive ſchool for&nbsp;princes as well as ſubjects to learn all their duties in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Inſtead of bluſhing at the lowneſs of his birth, Rollin on no occaſion heſitated to ſpeak of it. “ It is from&nbsp;the Cyclops’s ſhop (ſays he, in a Latin epigram to one&nbsp;of his friends, to whom he had ſent a ſmall ſword) that&nbsp;I have taken my flight towards Parnaſſus.” He was&nbsp;not, however, without ſome ſhare of vanity, eſpecially&nbsp;at hearing mention made of his writings, of which the&nbsp;well-timed praiſes of his adherents had given him a veιγ&nbsp;high opinion. He ſpoke without any diſſimulation&nbsp;what he thought ; and his opinions were leſs the effect&nbsp;of preſumption than of openneſs of heart. He was one&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">of</span><span class="font0"> thoſe mei» who are vain without any mixture of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
