<p><span class="font1">a number of genera but failed in the attempt to arrange them in a natural or logical system. All the more remarkable, therefore, is the production by IL Schlegel of an&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Essai surla Physionomie des Serpens</span><span class="font1"> (Leyden, 1837; ‘2 vols.&nbsp;8vo, with atlas in fol.). In this classical work the whole of&nbsp;the subject is treated throughout in a scientific manner ; the&nbsp;species are described with a clear discernment of really distinctive characters, the description being generally accompanied with a faithful outline figure of the head, and with&nbsp;a critical examination of the literature. Schlegel, besides,&nbsp;has the merit of having recognized the great importance of&nbsp;exactness with regard to localities, and of giving a general&nbsp;account of the geographical distribution of Snakes. The&nbsp;principle of classification adopted by Schlegel, indeed, is&nbsp;not one which will be recognized as final or even as&nbsp;legitimate at the present time, but it is one which is preferable to that employed by Müller, Duméril, and Bibron,&nbsp;which led, as we shall see presently, to the most artificial&nbsp;grouping of species. He divided the Snakes into families&nbsp;according to their “ physiognomy,” that is “ l'impression&nbsp;totale que fait sur nous l’ensemble d’un être quelconque,&nbsp;impression que l'on peut sentir, mais qu’il est impossible&nbsp;de rendre au moyen de paroles ; elle est le résultat de&nbsp;l’harmonie de toutes les parties isolées, dont on embrasse&nbsp;la confirmation d’un coup d’oeil, et dans leurs rapports&nbsp;mutuels.” Schlegel had no training in, or knowledge of,&nbsp;anatomy; he, therefore, ignored Müller’s researches which&nbsp;appeared a few years before his work ; yet it is noteworthy that his classification stands in the main, and&nbsp;has not yet been superseded. He divides Snakes as&nbsp;follows :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-venomous Snakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. 1. Burrowing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gen. Tortrix.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. 2. Worm-like.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gen. Calamaria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. 3. Terrestrial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gen. Coronella, Xenodon, Heterodon, Lycodon, Coluber, Herpetodryas, Psammophis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. 4. Arboreal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gen. Dendrophis, Dryophis, Divisas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. 5. Freshwater.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gen. Tropidonotus, Homalopsis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. 6. Boas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gen. Boa, Python, Acrochordus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Venomous Snakes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. 7. Colubriform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gen. Εlaps, Bungamis, Naja.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. 8. Marine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gen. Hydrophis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fam. 9. Venomous Snakes proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gen. Trigonocephalus, Crotalus, Vipera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Already in 1832 J. Müller had proposed “a natural classification of Snakes on anatomical principles,”@@<sup>1</sup> in&nbsp;which he paid particular attention to the osteology of&nbsp;the hitherto dubious forms of Ophidians, but in the end&nbsp;based his arrangement entirely on the structure of the&nbsp;jaws and on the dentition. As he did not extend his&nbsp;examination into other parts of the organization of the&nbsp;various genera, it may suffice here to state that he divided&nbsp;all Snakes into two sections, the first of which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ophidia&nbsp;microstomata)</span><span class="font1"> comprised the four families </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbænoidea,&nbsp;Typhlopina, Uropeltacea,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tortricina,</span><span class="font1"> and the second&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ophidia macrostomata)</span><span class="font1"> all the other Snakes, which he&nbsp;referred to seven families.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The direction thus indicated by Müller was followed by Dumeril and Bibron, who, however, by their much more&nbsp;detailed knowledge of Snakes, were enabled to subdivide&nbsp;the unwieldy categories formed by Müller ; also the&nbsp;genera which in Schlegel's system comprised Snakes with&nbsp;very different dentition had to be subdivided, and were&nbsp;defined with greater precision than had been done by any</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">previous herpetologist. They divide Snakes into five equivalent sections @@<sup>2</sup> :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opotérodontes. Teeth in one of .the jaws only : 2 families</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and 8 genera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aglyphodontes. Teeth in both jaws, none grooved: 12 families</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and 86 genera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opisthoglyphes. Posterior maxillary teeth grooved: 6 families</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and 37 genera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ProtéRogLYPHES. Anterior maxillary tooth grooved and fol</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lowed by other smooth teeth : 2 families and 16 genera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solénoglyphes. Anterior maxillary teeth perforated and iso</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lated : 2 families and 13 genera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The progress made in ophiology from the time of the appearance of this work down to the present period&nbsp;consists rather in the increase of our knowledge of the&nbsp;great variety of species and genera than in the further&nbsp;development of the system. Gray, Reinhardt, Peters,&nbsp;Günther, Cope, Bocage, Jan, Krefft, and others described&nbsp;a large number of forms, so that the number of those&nbsp;known to Duméril and Bibron has now been perhaps&nbsp;trebled or quadrupled. Unfortunately, no general work&nbsp;corresponding to the present state of science exists. But&nbsp;two works published subsequently to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erpétologie&nbsp;générale</span><span class="font1"> are indispensable to the student.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Catalogue of the Specimens of Snakes in the Collection of the British Museum,</span><span class="font1"> of which the first&nbsp;part, containing the Viperine Snakes, Water-Snakes, and&nbsp;Boas, by J. E. Gray, appeared in 1849, and the second,&nbsp;containing the Colubrines, by A. Günther in 1858. The&nbsp;classification, which was much behind its time, was fixed&nbsp;by the former of the two authors, so that the latter had&nbsp;to accommodate the arrangement of his part to that of&nbsp;his predecessor. However, he strongly opposed the&nbsp;application of the character of grooved posterior teeth to&nbsp;the formation of large sections, and generally adopted the&nbsp;principle advocated by Schlegel, whose generic groups were&nbsp;raised into families. A great number of Snakes unknown&nbsp;to Duméril are described in these catalogues, whilst others&nbsp;which happened not to be represented in the British&nbsp;Museum are omitted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">G. Jan in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elenco Sistematico degli Ofidi descritti e disegnati per l'Iconografia generale</span><span class="font1"> (Milan, 1863, 8vo) generally adopts the families created by Günther, but institutes&nbsp;under each two divisions, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aglyphodonta</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Glyphodonta.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Jan’s great merit is the publication of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iconographie&nbsp;générale des Ophidiens</span><span class="font1"> (Milan, 1860-76@@<sup>3</sup>), in which he&nbsp;figures all species which were in the Milan Museum or&nbsp;lent to him by other institutions, and which thus forms&nbsp;an invaluable aid in the determination of species. The&nbsp;author died during the progress of the work, but it was&nbsp;continued by his artist, Sordelli. No descriptive letter-press worthy of the name accompanies this work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The anatomy of Ophidians has hitherto received less attention than that of the other Reptilian orders. Besides the information contained in general works, we&nbsp;refer here only to two important special treatises :—</span></p>
