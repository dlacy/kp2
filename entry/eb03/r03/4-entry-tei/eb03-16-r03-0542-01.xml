<p><label>RUBIA</label>
madder : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the tetrandria claſs of plants ; and in the natural method ranking under the 47th order, <hi rend="italic">Stellate</hi> The corolla is monopetalous and campanulated; and there are two monoſpermous berries. There are three ſpecies, of which the moſt remarkable is the tinc-torum, or dyer’s madder, ſo much uſed by the dyer’s and callico-printers. This hath a perennial root and annual ſtalk: the root is compoſed of many long, thick, ſucculent fibres, almoſt as large as a man’s little finger; theſe are joined at the top in a head like aſparagus, and run very deep into the ground. From the upper part, or head of the root, come out many ſide-roots, which extend juſt under the ſurface of the ground to a great diſtance, whereby it propagates very faſt ; for theſe ſend up a great number of ſhoots, which, if carefully taken off in the ſpring ſoon after they are above ground, become ſo many plants. Theſe roots are of a reddiſh colour, ſomewhat tranſparent ; and have a yel-lowiſh pith in the middle, which is tough and of a bit-teriſh taſte. From this root ariſe many’ large four-cornered jointed ſtalks, which, in good land, wall grow live or ſix feet long, and, if ſupported, ſometimes ſeven or eight: they are armed with ſhort herbaceous prickles; and at each joint are placed five or ſix ſpear-ſhaped leaves: their upper ſurfaces are ſmooth: but their midrib on the under ſide is armed with rough herbaceous ſpines, and the leaves fit cloſe to the branches in whorls. From the joints of the ſtalk come out the branches, which ſuſtain the flowers : they .are placed by pairs oppoſite ; each pair croffing the other : theſe have a few ſmall leaves towaιd the bottom, which are by threes, and upwards by pairs oppoſite : the branches are terminated by looſe branching ſpikes of yellow flowers, which are cut into four parts reſembling ſtars. Theſe appear in June, and are ſometimes ſucceeded by ſeeds,</p>

<p>which ſeldom ripen in England. For the manner of its cultivation and preparation for the uſe of dyers, ſee the article Madder.</p><p>Madder-root is uſed in medicine. The virtues attributed to it are thoſe of a detergent and aperient ; whence it has been uſually ranked among the opening roots, and recommended in obſtructions of the viſcera, particularly ol the kidneys, in coagulations of the blood from falls or bruiſes, in the jaundice, and beginning dropfies. It is an ingredient in the icteric decoction of the Edinburgh pharmacopoeia.</p><p>It is obſervable, that this root, taken internally, tinges the urine of a deep red colour ; and in the Phi-loſophieal Tranſactions we have an account of its producing a like effect upon the bones of animals who had it mixed with their food : all the bones, particularly the more ſolid ones, w <hi rend="sup">r</hi> ere ſaid to be changed, both externally and internally, to a deep red; but neither the fleſhy or cartilaginous parts ſuffered any alterations : ſome of theſe bones macerated in water for many weeks together, and afterwards ſteeped and boiled in ſpirit of wine, loſt none of their colour, nor communicated any tinge to the liquors. This root, therefore, was concluded to be poſſeſſed of great ſubtilty of parts, and its medical virtues hence to deſerve inquiry. The ſame trials, however, made by others, have not been found to produce the ſame efi'ects as thoſe above-mentioned.— Of late the root has come into great reputation as an emmenagogue.</p>
