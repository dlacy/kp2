St John has also a free public library, numerous religious, charitable, scientific, and literary societies, and three daily newspapers. Carleton, on the opposite side of the river, and connected with the east side by ferry, is included within the corporation limits, and is represented in the common council. The population in 1871 was 28,805, in 1881 it was 26,127 (males 12,263, females 13,864), the decrease being caused by the great fire of 1877, when many persons left the city.</p><p>St John is the entrepot of a large extent of country, rich in minerals, agricultural produce, and timber. It is the seat of an extensive business connexion, and possesses first-class means of communication both by steamships and sailing vessels and by rail- ways. Οf late years its maritime and manufacturing interests have been greatly extended. The chief articles of manufacture are iron- castings, steam engines and locomotives, railway cars, coaches and carriages, machinery, edge-tools, nails and tacks, cotton and woollen goods, furniture, wooden ware, leather, boots and shoes, soap and candles, agricultural implements, lumber, sugar-boxes, paper, boats, sails, &amp;c. The fisheries afford employment to about 1000 men, and shad, salmon, holibut, cod, herrings, alewives, sturgeons, and haddock comprise the chief varieties taken. The exports ($4,310,576 in 1884) consist of fish, lumber, woollen and cotton goods, manufactured articles, &amp;c. ; the imports ($4,621,691 in 1884) are tobaccos, sugar and molasses, spirits and malt liquors, dried fruits, coffee, tea, silks, velvets, &amp;c. The following figures represent the movement of the coasting trade in 1884 :—vessels arrived 1864, tonnage 117,566, men 7340 ; vessels departed 1941, tonnage 105,050, men 6875. The number of entrances from foreign ports was 1904 (486,471 tons), of clearances 1961 (517,415 tons). The vessels on the registry books (31st December 1884) numbered 677, with a tonnage of 251,136; 53 vessels were built in that year with a tonnage of 18,989. The taxable property in 1885 was—real estate $9,122,000, personal $9,153,300, income $2,833,900, total $21,109,200. The corporation affairs are managed by a mayor, elected by the people annually, and a city council of eighteen members. St John city and county return three members to the House of Commons of Canada, and six members to the House of Assembly of New Brunswick. The climate, though healthy, is changeable, the pleasantest season being the autumn. The highest temperature observed since 1860 was 87° Fahr., and the lowest-22° Fahr., the mean temperature for spring, summer, autumn, and winter respectively being 36°·9, 58°, 45°, and 20°·6. The number of schools is 81, with 4171 pupils (average daily attendance 2722). Besides the libraries belonging to the city and the mechanics’ institute, there are large collections of books open to members of the young men’s Christian association and the Church of England institute. Navigation on St John river opens on 15th April and closes on 26th November.</p><p>De Monts visited St John in 1604, but it was not until 1635 that a regular settlement of the place was made, when Charles de la Tour founded a colony, which existed under French rule, with varying fortunes, until 1758, when it finally passed under British control. In 1764 the first Scottish settlers arrived in New Brunswick, and in 1783 the Loyalists landed at St John and established the city. It was called Parr Town, in honour of Governor Parr, until 1785, when it was incorporated with Conway (Carleton) under royal charter, as the city of St John.</p><p>ST JOHN, <hi rend="smallcaps">Charles William George</hi> (1809-1856), naturalist and sportsman, was the son of General the Hon. Frederick St John, second son of Frederick, second viscount Bolingbroke, and was born 3d December 1809. He was educated at Midhurst School, Sussex, and about 1828 obtained a clerkship in the treasury, but, after joining some friends in various expeditions to the Highlands of Scotland, he found his duties so irksome that he resigned in 1834. The same year he married a lady with some fortune, and was thus enabled to gratify his taste for the life of a sportsman and naturalist. He ultimately settled in the “ Laigh ” of Moray, “ within easy distance of mountain sport, in the midst of the game and wild animals of a low country, and with the coast indented by bays of the sea, and studded with freshwater lakes, the haunt of all the common wild fowl and many of the rarer sorts.” In 1853 a paralytic seizure permanently deprived him of the use of his limbs, and for the benefit of his health he removed to the south of England. He died at Wooston near Southampton on 22d July 1856.</p><p>He wrote several books on sport, which record the results of accurate observations on the habits and peculiarities of the birds</p><p>and wild animals of the Highlands. They are written in a pleasant and graphic style, and illustrated with engravings, many of them from pen-and-ink sketches of his own, in which the traits and features of the animals are depicted, though in rough outline, yet with almost the vividness of life. His works are <hi rend="italic">Wild Sports and Natural History of the Highlands</hi> (1846, 2d ed. 1848, 3d ed. 1861); <hi rend="italic">Tour in Sutherland</hi> (1849, 2d ed., with recollections by Captain H.
