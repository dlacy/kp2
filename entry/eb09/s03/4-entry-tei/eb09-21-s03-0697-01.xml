See Poor Laws. SÉTUBAL, called by the English St Ubes, a port and</p><p>commercial town in the province of Estremadura, Portugal, nearly 20 miles south-east of Lisbon, lining for about three-quarters of a mile the north shore of a harbour of the same name, 3 leagues long by half a league broad and inferior only to that of Lisbon, at the end of a fertile valley of 6 miles long from Palmella, where the Sabo river discharges into the Bay of Sétubal, and on the Portuguese railway (Lisbon-Barreiro-Sétubal). It is overtopped on the west by the great red treeless range of Arrabida. In the sandhills of a low-lying promontory in the bay, over against Sétubal, are the ruins of "Troia,” uncovered in part by heavy rains in 1814, and again in 1850 by an antiquarian society. These ruins of "Troia,” among which have been brought to view a beautiful Roman house and some 1600 Roman coins, refer, beyond almost all dispute, to Cetobriga, which flourished 300-400 a.d. In the neighbourhood, on a mountain 1700 feet high, is the cloister Arrabida, with stalactite cavern, whither pious pilgrimages are made. There are five forts for the defence of the harbour, and that of St Philip, built by Philip III., commands the town. Sétubal is an emporium of the Portuguese salt trade carried on principally with Scandinavian ports, the salt being deemed the finest for curing meat and fish. By reason of this advantage and the excellence of its oranges, the best in Portugal, and of its Muscatel grapes, it has much commercial importance, and is the fourth city in the kingdom. It also manufactures leather and does a considerable fishing trade. There are five churches, several convents, a theatre, a monument of the poet Bocage, who was born here,</p><p>and an arsenal. Among its other public buildings are the Stapal, the Bomfin, which has a handsome fountain, the Fonte Nova, and the Annunciata. Sétubal suffered severely, along with Lisbon, from the earthquake of 1755. The population was 14,798 in 1878.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
