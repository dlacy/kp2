<p><span class="font0">hoofed) feet, clavicles or collar-bones (occasionally imperfect or rudimentary), no canine teeth, and a single pair of lower incisors,&nbsp;opposed by only one similar and functional pair in the upper jaw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In all rodents the upper incisors resemble the lower ones in growing uninterruptedly from persistent pulps, and (except&nbsp;in the hare group, Duplicidentata) agree with them in number.&nbsp;The premolars and molars may be rooted or rootless, with&nbsp;tuberculated or laminated crowns, and are arranged in an&nbsp;unbroken series. The orbits arc always open behind, never&nbsp;being surrounded by bone. The condyle of the lower jaw is&nbsp;antero-posteriorly elongated. The intestine (except in the&nbsp;dormice or Gliridae) has a large caecum. The testes are inguinal or abdominal. The uterus is two-horned, with the&nbsp;cornua opening separately into the vagina or uniting to form&nbsp;a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Corptcs uteri.</span><span class="font0"> The placenta is discoidal and deciduate. And&nbsp;the smooth hemispheres of the brain do not extend backwards&nbsp;so as to cover any part of the cerebellum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rodents include by far the greater number of species, and have the widest distribution, of any of the orders of terrestrial&nbsp;mammals, being in fact cosmopolitan, although more abundant&nbsp;in some parts, as in South America, which may be considered&nbsp;their headquarters, than in others, as in Australasia and Madagascar, where they are represented only by members of the&nbsp;mouse-group, or Myoidea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All rodents are vegetable-feeders, and this uniformity in their food and in the mode of obtaining it, namely by gnawing,&nbsp;has led to that general uniformity ■ in structure observable&nbsp;throughout the group; a feature which renders their classification difficult. Indeed, despite the fact that they present much&nbsp;diversity of habit—some being arboreal, as the squirrels, many&nbsp;of which are provided with expansions of skin or parachutes&nbsp;on which they glide from tree to tree; some cursorial, as the&nbsp;hares; others jumpers, as the jerboas; others fossorial, as&nbsp;the mole-rats; and others aquatic, as the beavers and water-rats—no important structural modifications are correlated&nbsp;with such diversity of habit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Anatomy.—</span><span class="font0">The rodent skull is characterized by the great size of the premaxillae, which completely separate the nasals from the maxillae;&nbsp;by the presence of zygomatic arches; and by the wide unoccupied&nbsp;space existing between the incisors and the cheek-teeth ; and (except&nbsp;in the Duplicidentata) by the antero-posteriorly elongated glenoid&nbsp;cavity for the articulation of the lower jaw. Post-orbital processes&nbsp;of the frontals exist in squirrels, marmots and hares; but in all&nbsp;other genera they arc rudimentary or altogether absent; and the&nbsp;zygoma seldom sends upwards a corresponding process, so that&nbsp;the orbit is more&nbsp;or less completely&nbsp;continuous with&nbsp;the temporal fossa.&nbsp;The lachrymal for-namen is always&nbsp;within the orbital&nbsp;margin; and in&nbsp;many species the&nbsp;infra-orbital foramen is very large&nbsp;(in some as large&nbsp;as the orbit) and&nbsp;transmits part of&nbsp;the masseter&nbsp;muscle. The zygomatic arch is&nbsp;variously developed, and the&nbsp;position of the&nbsp;jugal is a character&nbsp;for grouping the&nbsp;families. The nasals are, with few&nbsp;exceptions, large,&nbsp;and extend far&nbsp;forwards, the pari-etals are moderate, and there is generally a distinct interparietal. The&nbsp;palate is narrow from before backwards, this being especially the&nbsp;case in the hares, where it is reduced to a mere bridge between the&nbsp;premolars; in others, as in the rodent-moles (Bathyerginae), it is&nbsp;extremely narrow transversely, its width being Iessthan that of one of&nbsp;the molar teeth. Tympanic bullae are always present and generally&nbsp;large; in some genera, as in the gerbils (Gerbillinae) and jerboas&nbsp;Oaculidae), there are supplemental mastoid bullae which form great</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">In the Duplicidentata only is there more than a single pair of incisors, and in these the additional pair is small and placed,&nbsp;behind the middle pair. In this group the enamel extends partially to the back of the incisors, but in all the rest it is restricted&nbsp;to the front surface, so that, by the more rapid wearing-away of&nbsp;the softer structures behind, a chisel-shaped edge is maintained.&nbsp;Both upper and lower incisors are regularly curved, the upper ones,&nbsp;slightly more so than the lower; and, their growth being continuous, should anything prevent the normal wear by which their&nbsp;length is regulated—as by the loss of one of them, or by displacement owing to a broken jaw or other cause—the unopposed incisor&nbsp;may gradually curve upon itself until a complete circle or more has.&nbsp;been formed, the tooth sometimes passing through some part of&nbsp;the animal’s head. The cheek-teeth may be either rooted or</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">rootless, and either cusped or formed of parallel plates, this diversity of structure often occurring in the same family. When there are&nbsp;more than three cheek-teeth, those which precede the last three&nbsp;have succeeded milk-teeth, and are premolars. In some species,&nbsp;as in the agoutis (Dasyproctidae), the milk-teeth are long retained,&nbsp;while in the allied cavies (Caviidae) they are shed before birth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tongue presents little variability in length, being short and compressed, with a blunt tip, which is never protruded beyond the&nbsp;incisors. In most species there are three Circumvallate papillae at&nbsp;the base, and the apical portion is generally covered with small&nbsp;thread-like papillae, some of w<sup>r</sup>hich in the porcupines become greatly&nbsp;enlarged, forming toothed spines. The stomach varies in form&nbsp;from the simple oval bag of the squirrels to the complex ruminantlike organ of the lemmings. In the water-rat and agoutis it is&nbsp;constricted between the oesophagus and pylorus; while in the&nbsp;dormouse the oesophagus immediately before entering the stomach&nbsp;is much dilated, forming a large egg-shaped bag with thickened&nbsp;glandular walls; and in certain other species, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lophiomys</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;the beaver, glandular masses are attached to and open into the&nbsp;cardiac or pyloric pouches. All rodents, with the sole exception&nbsp;of the drmice, have a caecum, often of great length and sacculated,&nbsp;as in hares, the water-rat and porcupines; and the long colon in&nbsp;some, as the hamster and water-rat, is spirally twisted upon itself&nbsp;near the commencement. The liver is divided in the typical manner&nbsp;in all, but the lobes are variously subdivided in different species&nbsp;(in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Capromys</span><span class="font0"> they are divided into minute lobules); and the gallbladder, though present in most, is absent in a few. In most&nbsp;species the penis (which is generally provided with a bone) may&nbsp;be more pr less completely retracted within the fold of integument&nbsp;surrounding the vent, and lie curved backwards upon itself under&nbsp;cover of the integument, or it may be carried forward some distance&nbsp;in front of the anal orifice, from which, as in voles and marmots,.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
