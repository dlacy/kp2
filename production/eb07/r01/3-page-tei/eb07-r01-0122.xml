Amongst his first undertakings in either line was that of the Lancaster Canal, which presented many difficulties, and, amongst others, that of carrying it by an aqueduct over the Lune, so as not to interrupt the navigation of the river. Being one of the largest fabrics of its kind in Europe, and of a pleasing design, it is an object that arrests the attention of strangers, and is very generally admired. The bridges of Leeds, Musselburgh, Kelso, Newton-Stewart, Boston, New Galloway, and a multitude of others, attest the architectural skill, the solidity, and, we may add, the good taste of Rennie ; whilst a thousand smaller ones, with the various locks, wharf-walls, quays, embankments appertaining to canals, rivers, and harbours, in every part of the united kingdom, are so many proofs of his diversified talent, and his skill in adapting the means to the end. The breakwater in Plymouth Sound can scarcely be called an architectural work, but it is constructed on true hydrodynamical principles, and so gigantic in its dimensions, and cyclopean in its structure, as to defy equally the force of the waves and the ravages of time. To Mr Whidby, who zealously superintended the execution of this immortal work, the highest praise is also due ; nor was the plan finally determined on without his advice and assistance.</p><p>But the architectural work which, above all others, will immortalize the name of Rennie, is the Waterloo Bridge, a structure which, even foreigners admit, has no parallel in Europe (and if not in Europe, certainly not in the whole world) for its magnitude, its beauty, and its solidity. That a fabric so immense, presenting a straight horizontal line, stretching over nine large arches, should not have altered more than a few inches, not five in any one part, from that straight line, is an instance of firmness and solidity utterly unknown, and almost incredible; @@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> but all Rennie’s works have been constructed for posterity. He made nothing slight ; nor would he engage in any undertaking where, from an ill-judging economy, a sufficiency of funds was not forthcoming to meet his views.    </p><p>Another work, executed from a design of his, is that of the stone bridge over the Thames, by which the old London Bridge, so long the disgrace of the metropolis, was replaced. His design, which was selected by a committee of the House of Commons, out of at least thirty that were offered, consisted of a granite bridge of five arches, the centre one of 150 feet span, being the largest stone arch in the world which has been constructed in modern times. This great work, an account of which will be found under the head London, cannot but form a remarkable feature in the future history of the capital. For of the five bridges which connect the two banks of the Thames, three have been built from the designs of one man ; a fact which must throw a lustre on the name of Rennie, and be regarded with a feeling of pride by the most distant connection of his family.</p><p>Thirdly, as a Civil Engineer. The first great attempt in this line of his profession was the survey and execution of the Crinan Canal, a work remarkable for the multitude of practical difficulties that occurred throughout the whole of this bold undertaking ; it being necessary in many places to cut down through solid rock, to the depth of sixty feet; and it is rather remarkable, that the second undertaking, the Lancaster Canal, was also replete with difficulties, and called for the exercise of his skill as an architect, as we have already seen in noticing the aqueduct over the Lune. But these two works established his reputation as a civil engineer, and his opinion and assistance were required from all quarters. His faculties were now called into full play, and they expanded with the demands made upon them. The rage for canals had pervaded every part of the kingdom, and scarcely any of these useful means of conveyance and communication was thought of without a previous consultation with Rennie ; so that in a few years the surveys he was called upon to make were so numerous, that he knew the surface of England as it were by heart, and could tell at once, when a canal was projected, whereabouts the line of it ought to be carried. The following are some of the most important of those the execution of which he personally attended : Aberdeen, Brechin, Grand Western, Kennet and Avon, Portsmouth, Birmingham, Worcester, besides many others.</p><p>But the resources of his mind were displayed in all their vigour in the plans and construction of those magnificent docks, which are at once an ornament to the capital, and of the utmost utility to commerce and navigation. Nor are these splendid and useful works confined to the metropolis. The docks at Hull, Greenock, Leith, Liverpool, and Dublin, attest his skill ; and the harbours of Queensferry, Berwick, Howth, Holyhead, Dunleary (now called Kingstown Har-bour), Newhaven, and several others, owe their security and convenience to his labours.</p><p>But even these works, splendid as they are, must yield to what he has planned and executed in her majesty’s dock-yards at Portsmouth, Plymouth, Chatham, and Sheemess. The latter was a mere quicksand of forty feet in depth, mixed with mud and the wrecks of old ships ; the whole of which was excavated, and a magnificent basin constructed, with a beautiful surrounding wall of granite, with which three of the finest dry docks in the universe communicate ; and that important dock-yard, which may be said to command the mouths of the Thames and the Medway, from being an unhealthy and detestable place, and wholly inefficient for its purpose, is now, by being raised many feet, and laid out with skill and judgment, one of the most convenient in the kingdom, He also planned the new naval arsenal at Pembroke, which is considered as a perfect model for a building-yard. But his plan for the projected naval arsenal at Northfleet on the Thames was far superior to all in design ; and upon a scale so grand as to be capable of containing afloat two thirds of the whole navy, with dry docks and slips for repairing and building ships of all classes to the same extent, and with all manner of storehouses, workshops, and manufactories of all such articles as were required for consumption in the navy. But the estimated sum of eight millions, which would probably have amounted to ten, induced the government to pause, and it was finally deemed prudent to abandon the design altogether.</p><p>Mr Smeaton, we believe, was the first who used the diving-bell effectually for building with stone under water; but the machine he employed for that purpose was very defective, and could be used only in certain situations. Rennie, however, by improvements in the instrument itself, and in the machinery by which its movements could be regulated, was enabled to carry on the finest masonry, and the foundations of sea-walls, piers, and quays, as well under water as above it The repairing of the pier-head of Ramsgate Harbour was a remarkable instance of this kind. The violence of the waves, acting upon the bad quality of the stone, had so completely undermined it that the stability of the whole pier began to be endangered. It was from ten to thirteen feet below the level of low water, spring-tides; yet by means of the improved diving-bell and its apparatus, the pier-head was not only effectually secured, but rendered more solid and durable than it originally had been. In the harbour of Howth the diving-bell was of the utmost use; and it is remarkable enough, that the masons who have been for a little while accustomed to work under water prefer it, at least the Irish masons do, to working in the air,</p><p><hi rend="sup"/>@@@ <hi rend="sup">1</hi> The bridge of Neuilly, which the vanity of the French led them to rank as superior to that of Waterloo, actually sunk 23 inches.</p></body></text></TEI>
