<p><span class="font0">embaſſy to him with a preſent of a throne adorned with ivory, a ſceptre, a crown of gold, and a triumphal&nbsp;robe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus the Romans eſeaped the greateſt danger they had hitherto been in. However, they did not yet enjoy&nbsp;tranquillity. The Sabines revolted, and continued the&nbsp;war for ſome time with great obſtinacy : but being defeated in ſeveral engagements, they were at laſt obliged&nbsp;to ſubmit ; and ſcarce was this war ended, when another&nbsp;began with the Latins, who now declared ſor king&nbsp;Tarquin. Before they jjegan this war, however, an&nbsp;embaſſy was ſent to Rome, the purport of which was,&nbsp;that the Romans ſhould raiſe the ſiege of Fidenæ which&nbsp;had revolted, and receive the Tarquins ; who, on their&nbsp;part, ſhould grant a general amneſty. The ambaſſadors&nbsp;were to allow the Romans a whole year to conſider on&nbsp;theſe overtures ; and to threaten them with a war in&nbsp;caſe they reſuſed to comply with them. The chief&nbsp;view of Tarquin and his partiſans in promoting this&nbsp;embaſſy was, to lay hold of that opportunity to raiſe a&nbsp;ſedition in the city. To the ambaſſadors, therefore, of&nbsp;the Latins, he joined ſome of his own emiſſaries, who,&nbsp;on their arrival in the city, found two ſorts of people&nbsp;diſpoſed to enter into their meaſures; to wit, the ∩aves,&nbsp;and the meaner citizens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ſlaves had formed a conſpiracy the year before to ſeize the Capitol, and ſet fire to the city in ſeveral&nbsp;quarters at the ſame time. But the plot being diſcovered, thoſe who were concerned in it had been all&nbsp;crucified, and this execution had highly provoked the&nbsp;whole body of ſlaves. As to the meaner citizens, who&nbsp;were for the moſt part overwhelmed with debt, and&nbsp;cruelly uſed by their creditors, they were well appri-ſed that there could happen no change in the government but to their advantage. Theſe were the conſpirators pitched upon, and to them were given the following parts to act : the citizens were to make themſelves maſters of the ramparts and gates of the city, at&nbsp;an appointed hour of the night ; and then to raiſe a&nbsp;great ſhout as a ſignal to the ſlaves, who had engaged&nbsp;to maſſacre their maſters at the ſame inſtant : the gates&nbsp;of the city were then to be opened to the Tarquins,&nbsp;who were to enter Rome while it was yet reeking with&nbsp;the blood of the ſenators. The conſpiracy was ripe&nbsp;for execution, when Tarquin’s principal agents, Publius and Marcus, both of his own name and family,&nbsp;being terrified with frightful dreams, had not courage&nbsp;enough to proceed in their deſign till they had conſulted a diviner. However, they did not diſcover to&nbsp;him the conſpiracy ; but only aſhed him in general&nbsp;terms, what ſucceſs they might expect in a project&nbsp;they had formed ? The ſoothſayer, without the leaſt&nbsp;heſitation, returned the following anſwer ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dour project&nbsp;will end in your ruin ; dſburden your (elves of ſo heavy a&nbsp;load.</span><span class="font0"> Hereupon the Tarquins, fearing leſt ſome of the&nbsp;other conſpirators ſhould be beforehand with them in&nbsp;informing, went immediately to S. Sulpitius, the only&nbsp;conſul then at Rome, and diſcovered the whole matter&nbsp;to him. Tſte conſul greatly commended them, and detained them in his houſe, till, by private inquiries, he&nbsp;was aſſured of the truth of their depoſitions. Then he&nbsp;aſſembled the ſenate, and gave the Latin ambaſſadors&nbsp;their audience of leave, with an anſwer to their propofols; which was, that the Romans would neither receive&nbsp;the Tarquins, nor raiſe the ſiege of Fidenæ, being all</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">to a man ready to ſacriſice their lives in defence of their liberties, and willing to undergo any dangers rather than&nbsp;ſubmit to the government of a tyrant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ambaſſadors being diſmiſſed with this anſwer, and conducted out of the city, Sulpitius laid open to&nbsp;the fathers the dreadful conſpiracy. It ſtruck them&nbsp;with horror : but they were all at a loſs in what manner they ſhould apprehend and puniſh the guilty; ſince,&nbsp;by the law of Poplicola, there was an appeal to the&nbsp;people in all capital caſes ; and the two witneſſes, who&nbsp;were ſtrangers, might be excepted againſt by Roman&nbsp;citizens. In this perplexity they left the whole conduct of this critical affair to Sulpitius; who took a method which he thought would equally ſerve to prove&nbsp;the guilt and puniſh the guilty. He engaged the two&nbsp;informers to aſſemble the conſpirators, and to appoint&nbsp;a rendezvous at midnight in the forum, as if they deſigned to take the laſt meaſures for the execution of the&nbsp;enterpriſe. In the mean time he uſed all proper means&nbsp;to ſecure the city, and ordered the Roman knights to&nbsp;hold themſelves ready, in the houſes adjoining to the&nbsp;forum, to execute the orders they ſhould receive. The&nbsp;conſpirators met at the time and place appointed by&nbsp;the two Tarquins ; and the knights, upon a ſignal&nbsp;agreed on beforehand, inveſted the forum, and blocked&nbsp;up all the avenues to it ſo cloſely, that it was impoſſiblè&nbsp;for any of the conſpirators to make their eſcape. ’ As&nbsp;ſoon as it was light, the two conſuls appeared with a&nbsp;ſtrong guard on the tribunal ; for Sulpitius had ſent to&nbsp;his colleague Manius, who was beſieging Fidenæ, deſiring him to haften to the city with a choſen body of&nbsp;troops. The people were convened by curiæ, and acquainted with the conſpiracy which' had been formed&nbsp;againſt the common liberty. The accuſed were allowed to make their defence, if they had any thing to&nbsp;offer againſt the evidence; but not one of them denying&nbsp;the fact, the conſuls repaired to the ſenate, where ſentence of death was pronounced againſt the conſpirators,&nbsp;in caſe the people approved it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This decree of the ſenate being read to and approved by the aſſembly, the people were ordered to retire, and&nbsp;the conſpirators were delivered up to the ſoldiers, who&nbsp;put them all to the ſword. The peace of Rome was&nbsp;thought ſufficiently ſecured by this ſtroke of ſeverity ;&nbsp;and therefore, though all the conſpirators were not puniſhed with death, it was judged proper not to make&nbsp;any further inquiries. The two informers were rewarded with all the privileges of Roman citizens, ιoo,boo&nbsp;aſes, and 20 acres of land. Three feſtival-days were&nbsp;appointed for expiations, ſacrifices, and public games,&nbsp;by way of thankſgiving to the gods. But rhe general&nbsp;joy was diſturbed by a melancholy accident : as the&nbsp;people were conducting Manius Tullius the conſul from&nbsp;the circus to his houſe, he fell from his chariot, and died&nbsp;three days after.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The city of Fidenæ was not yet reduced : it held out during the following conſulſhip of T. Æbutius and&nbsp;P. Veturius ; but was taken the next year by T. Lartius, who, together with Q. Cl</span><span class="font1">æ</span><span class="font0">lius, was raiſed to the&nbsp;conſular dignity. The Latins, enraged at the loſs of&nbsp;this town, began to complain of their leading men ;&nbsp;which opportunity Tarquin and Mamilius improved fo&nbsp;far, as to make all the Latin cities, 24 in number, enter&nbsp;into an alliance againſt Rome, and t6' bind themſelves&nbsp;by oath never to violate their engagements.
