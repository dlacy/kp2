<p><span class="font0">the rest of the line severe local fighting had continued, but the Russian positions were quite unshaken, and Kuropatkin’s&nbsp;reserves—which would have been invaluable in backing up the&nbsp;counter-attack of the 2nd of March—had returned to face Nogi.&nbsp;He had organized another counterstroke for the 6th, to be led&nbsp;by Kaulbars, but this collapsed unexpectedly after a brief but&nbsp;severe fight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Kuropatkin now decided to draw in his centre and left towards Mukden. On the 7th, the various columns executed their&nbsp;movement to the Hun-ho with complete success, thanks to good&nbsp;staff work. The Japanese followed up only slowly. Nogi and&nbsp;Kaulbars stood fast, facing each other on the west front; after&nbsp;the arrival of the general reserve, Nogi was able to prolong his&nbsp;line to the north and eventually to bend it inwards towards the&nbsp;Russian line of retreat. Bilderling and Linievich were now&nbsp;close in to Mukden and along the Hun-ho. On the other side&nbsp;Oku had taken over part of Nogi’s line, thus freeing the 3rd&nbsp;Army for further extension to the north-west, and the rest of&nbsp;the 2nd Army, the 4th, the 1st and the 5th were approaching&nbsp;the Hun-ho from the south (March 8th). On this day the&nbsp;fighting between Nogi and Kaulbars was very severe,&nbsp;and Kuropatkin now made up his mind to retreat&nbsp;towards Tieling. On the 9th, by Oyama’s orders, Nogi&nbsp;extended northward instead of further swinging in south-eastward, Oku now occupied all the original line of the 3rd Army,&nbsp;Nozu alone was left on the south front, and Kuroki and Kawa-mura began to engage Linievich seriously. But Nogi had not&nbsp;yet reached the Mukden-Tieling railway when, on the night&nbsp;of the 9th, every preparation having been made, Kuropatkin’s&nbsp;retreat began. On the 10th, covered by Kaulbars, who held off&nbsp;Nogi, and by strong rearguards at and east of Mukden, the&nbsp;movement continued, and though it was not executed with&nbsp;entire precision, and the rearguards suffered very heavily, the&nbsp;Russians managed to draw off in safety to the northward. On&nbsp;the evening of the 10th, after all their long and hardly contested&nbsp;enveloping marches, Nogi’s left and Kawamura’s right met north&nbsp;of Mukden. The circle was complete, but there were no Russians&nbsp;in the centre, and a map of the positions of the Japanese on the&nbsp;evening of the 10th shows the seventeen divisions thoroughly&nbsp;mixed up and pointing in every direction but that of the enemy.&nbsp;Thus the further pursuit of the Russians could only be undertaken after an interval of re-organization by the northernmost&nbsp;troops of the 5th and 3rd Armies. But the material loss inflicted on the Russians was far heavier than it had ever been&nbsp;before. It is generally estimated that the Russian losses were&nbsp;no less than 97,000, and the Japanese between 40,000 and 50,000.&nbsp;Japan had had to put forth her supreme effort for the battle,&nbsp;while of Russia’s whole strength not one-tenth had been used.&nbsp;But Russia’s strength in Europe, with but one line whereby it&nbsp;could be brought to bear in the Far East, was immaterial, and&nbsp;on the theatre of war a quarter of the Russian field forces had</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">been killed, wounded or taken.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It remains to narrate briefly the tragic career of the Russian Baltic fleet. Leaving Libau on the, I3th-i5th of October 1904, the&nbsp;fleet steamed down the North Sea, expecting eveiy night&nbsp;to be attacked by torpedo-boats. On the 21st, in their&nbsp;excitement, they opened fire on a fleet of British trawlers</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">- on the Dogger Bank (g.v.), and several fishermen were killed. This incident provoked the wildest indignation, and Russia&nbsp;was for some days on the verge of war with England. A British&nbsp;fleet “ shadowed ” Rozhestvenski for some time, but eventually&nbsp;the Russians </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">were</span><span class="font0"> allowed to proceed. On reaching Madagascar,&nbsp;Rozhestvenski heard of the fall of Port Arthur, and the question&nbsp;of returning to Russia arose. But a reinforcement under Rear-Admiral Nebogatov was despatched from the Baltic via Suez&nbsp;early in March 1905, and the armada proceeded by the Straits of&nbsp;Malacca, Nebogatov joining at Kamranh Bay in Cochin China.&nbsp;The united fleet was formidable rather in number than in quality;&nbsp;the battleships were of very unequal value, and the faster vessels&nbsp;were tied to the movements of many “ lame ducks.” Rozhestvenski had, moreover, numerous store-ships, colliers, &amp;c. Nevertheless, the Japanese viewed his approach with considerable anxiety,&nbsp;and braced themselves for a final struggle. Of the various courses&nbsp;open to him, Togo prudently chose that of awaiting Rozhestvenski&nbsp;in home waters. The Russians left Kamranh on the 14th of May,&nbsp;and for a time disappeared into the Pacific. It was assumed that&nbsp;they were making for Vladivostok either via Tsushima strait or by the&nbsp;Pacific. Rozhestvenski chose the former course, and on the 27th of&nbsp;May the fleets met near Tsushima. About 1.45 p.m., the&nbsp;Russians, who were still in a close cruising formation,&nbsp;attempted to open out for battle as the Japanese approached. The Russian battleships, originally heading&nbsp;N.N.E., swerved to the E. as the Japanese battle squadron&nbsp;passed across their front. Togo’s fire was concentrated first on the&nbsp;<sup>h</sup> Osliabia,” the leading Russian battleship, and by 2.25 she was&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hors de combat.</span><span class="font0"> At this time both the battle-fleets were running&nbsp;E. Togo, concentrating his fire on each ship in succession, and seeking by superior speed to head off the Russians, now inclined towards&nbsp;the S.E., and the Russians conformed. At 3, the Russian flagship&nbsp;“Suvaroy” had fallen out of the line, though still firing. Rozhestvenski himself had been wounded, and the command had devolved&nbsp;on Nebogatov. Shortly afterwards the Russians suddenly turned&nbsp;N., and sought to pass, across the wake of Togo’s battle-fleet, up&nbsp;the straits. Thereupon the leading Japanese ships promptly&nbsp;turned together, covered by the rear ships, which ran past tnem&nbsp;on the original course and then came round in succession; this&nbsp;manœuvre was so well executed that the Japanese again headed&nbsp;off their enemy, who swerved for the second time towards the E.&nbsp;The Japanese thereupon executed the same manœuvre as before,&nbsp;and steamed.S.E. again (about 4.40). They were not unscathed,&nbsp;but the Russians were suffering far more severely. Meanwhile, the&nbsp;cruisers on both sides had been heavily engaged. The Russian&nbsp;cruisers kept on the right of their battleships, while the Japanese,&nbsp;very superior in speed, ran S., S.E. and E. across the rear of&nbsp;the enemy’s main squadron, and about 3 ranged up alongside the&nbsp;Russian cruisers. The latter were slower, and hampered by the&nbsp;crowd of damaged battleships, store-ships and colliers; before 5&nbsp;they were in the greatest confusion, which was presently increased&nbsp;by the battleship squadron, now turned back and heading W., with&nbsp;Togo in pursuit. The Russians again broke out northward; but&nbsp;some of the Japanese squadrons hun^ on to the remnant of the enemy’s&nbsp;battle-fleet, and the others dealt with the numerous Russian vessels&nbsp;that were unable to keep up. Then Togo called off his ships, and&nbsp;gave the torpedo craft room and the night in which to act. At daylight the larger ships joined in again, and before long the whole&nbsp;Russian fleet, with few exceptions, had been captured or sunk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the disasters of Mukden and Tsushima, and being threatened with internal disorder in European Russia, the tsar,&nbsp;early in June, accepted the mediation of the president of&nbsp;the United States, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pourparlers</span><span class="font0"> were set on foot.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The war meanwhile drifted on through May, June and July. Linievich, who succeeded Kuropatkin shortly after&nbsp;the battle of Mukden, retired slowly northward, re-organizing&nbsp;his forces and receiving fresh reinforcements from Europe. A&nbsp;Japanese expedition occupied Saghalien (July 8-30), and another,&nbsp;General Hasegawa, advanced through Korea towards Vladivostok. But the fighting was desultory. The peace negotiations&nbsp;were opened at Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on the 9th of&nbsp;August, and by the end of the month the belligerents had&nbsp;agreed as to the main points at issue, that Russia should cede&nbsp;the half of Saghalien, annexed in 1875, surrender her lease of the&nbsp;Kwangtung peninsula and Port Arthur, evacuate Manchuria&nbsp;and recognize Japan’s sphere of influence in Korea. The treaty&nbsp;of peace was signed on the 23rd of August 1905.</span></p>
