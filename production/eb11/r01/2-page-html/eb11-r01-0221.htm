<p><span class="font0">neatly, as if we were mere barbarians. Our nation, once so famous, is a slave now, who must pay tribute, and has lain in the&nbsp;dust these many years bemoaning her fate.” Aeneas Sylvius&nbsp;issued, immediately after his accession to the papacy as Pius II.&nbsp;the bull </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Execrabilis</span><span class="font0"> forbidding all appeals to a future council.&nbsp;This seemed to Germany to cut off its last hope. It found a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">spokesman in the vigorous Gregory of Heimburg, who accused the pope of issuing the bull so that he and his cardinals might&nbsp;conveniently pillage Germany unhampered by the threat of&nbsp;a council. “ By forbidding appeals to a council the pope&nbsp;treats us like slaves, and wishes to take for his own pleasures&nbsp;all that we and our ancestors have accumulated by honest&nbsp;labour. He calls me a chatterer, although he himself is more&nbsp;talkative than a magpie.” Heimburg’s denunciations of the&nbsp;pope were widely circulated, and in spite of the major excommunication he was taken into the service of the archbishop of&nbsp;Mainz and was his representative at the diet of Nuremberg in&nbsp;1462. It is thus clear that motives which might ultimately&nbsp;lead to the withdrawal of a certain number of German&nbsp;princes from the papal ecclesiastical state were accumulating and intensifying during the latter half of the 15th&nbsp;century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is impossible to review here the complicated political history of the opening years of the 16th century. The&nbsp;names of Charles VIII. and Louis XII. of France, of&nbsp;Ferdinand and Isabella of Spain, of Henry VII. and&nbsp;Henry VIII. of England, of Maximilian the German&nbsp;king, of Popes Alexander VI., Julius II. and Leo X.,&nbsp;stand for better organized civil governments, with&nbsp;growing powerful despotic heads; for a perfectly&nbsp;worldly papacy absorbed in the interests of an Italian principality, engaged in constant political negotiations with the&nbsp;European powers which are beginning to regard Italy as their&nbsp;chief field of rivalry, and are using its little states as convenient&nbsp;counters in their game of diplomacy and war. It was in Germany, however, seemingly the weakest and least aggressive of the&nbsp;European states, that the first permanent and successful revolts&nbsp;against the papal monarchy occurred. Nothing came of the lists&nbsp;of German </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gravamina,</span><span class="font0"> or of the demands for a council, so long&nbsp;as the incompetent Frederick III. continued to reign. His&nbsp;successor, Maximilian, who was elected emperor in 1493, was&nbsp;mainly preoccupied with his wars and attempts to reform the&nbsp;constitution of the empire; but the diet gave some attention&nbsp;to ecclesiastical reform. For instance, in 1501 it took measures&nbsp;to prevent money raised by the granting of a papal indulgence&nbsp;from leaving the country. After the disruption of the league of&nbsp;Cambray, Maximilian, like Louis XII., was thrown into a violent&nbsp;anti-curial reaction, and in 1510 he sent to the well-known&nbsp;humanist, Joseph Wimpheling, a copy of the French Pragmatic&nbsp;Sanction, asking his advice and stating that he had determined&nbsp;to free Germany from the yoke of the Curia and prevent the&nbsp;great sums of money from going to Rome. Wimpheling in his&nbsp;reply rehearsed the old grievances and complained that the&nbsp;contributions made to the pope by the archbishops on receiving&nbsp;the pallium was a great burden on the people. He stated that&nbsp;that of the' archbishop of Mainz had been raised from ten to&nbsp;twenty-five thousand gulden, and that there had been seven&nbsp;vacancies within a generation, and consequently the subjects&nbsp;of the elector had been forced to pay that amount seven times.&nbsp;But Wimpheling had only some timid suggestions to make, and,&nbsp;since Maximilian was once more on happy terms with the pope,&nbsp;political considerations served to cool completely his momentary&nbsp;ardour for ecclesiastical reform. In 1514 the archbishopric&nbsp;of Mainz fell vacant again, and Albert of Brandenburg, already&nbsp;archbishop of Magdeburg and administrator of Halberstadt,&nbsp;longing to add it to his possessions, was elected. After some&nbsp;scandalous negotiations with Leo X. it was arranged that&nbsp;Albert should pay 14,000 ducats for the papal confirmation and&nbsp;10,000 as a “ composition ” for permission to continue to hold,&nbsp;against the rules of the Church, his two former archbishoprics.&nbsp;Moreover, in order to permit him to pay the sums, he was to&nbsp;have half the proceeds in his provinces from an indulgence&nbsp;granted to forward the rebuilding of St Peter’s. A Dominican&nbsp;monk, Johann Tetzel, was selected to proclaim the indulgence&nbsp;(together with certain supplementary graces) in the three&nbsp;provinces of the elector. This suggestion came from the curia,&nbsp;not the elector, whose representatives could not suppress the&nbsp;fear that the plan would arouse opposition and perhaps worse.&nbsp;Tetzel’s preaching and the exaggerated claims that he was reported to be making for the indulgences attracted the attention&nbsp;of an Augustinian friar, Martin Luther, who had for some&nbsp;years been lecturing on theology at the university of Wittenberg.&nbsp;He found it impossible to reconcile Tetzel’s views of indulgences&nbsp;with his own fundamental theory of salvation. He accordingly&nbsp;hastily drafted ninety-five propositions relating to indulgences,&nbsp;and posted an invitation to those who wished to attend a&nbsp;disputation in Wittenberg on the matter, under his presidency.&nbsp;He points out the equivocal character of the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">poenitentia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which meant both “ penance ” and “ penitence ”; he declared&nbsp;that “true contrition seeks punishment, while the ampleness&nbsp;of pardons relaxes it and causes men to hate it.’’ Christians&nbsp;ought to be taught that he who gives to a poor man or lends to&nbsp;the needy does better than if he bought pardons. He concludes&nbsp;with certain “ keen questionings of the laity,” as, Why does&nbsp;not the pope empty purgatory forthwith for charity’s sake,&nbsp;instead of cautiously for money ? Why does he not, since he&nbsp;is rich as Croesus, build St Peter’s with his own money instead&nbsp;of taking that of poor believers ? It was probably these closing&nbsp;reflections which led to the translation of the theses from Latin&nbsp;into German, and their surprising circulation. It must not be&nbsp;assumed that Luther’s ninety-five theses produced any considerable direct results. They awakened the author himself&nbsp;to a consciousness that his doctrines were after all incompatible&nbsp;with some of the Church’s teachings, and led him to consider&nbsp;the nature of the papal power which issued the indulgence.&nbsp;Two or three years elapsed before Luther began to be&nbsp;generally known and to exercise a perceptible influence upon&nbsp;affairs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In July 1518 a diet assembled in Augsburg to consider the new danger from the Turks, who were making rapid conquests&nbsp;under Sultan Selim I. The pope’s representative,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Cardinal Cajetan, made it clear that the only safety lay in the collection of a tenth from the clergy&nbsp;and a twentieth from laymen; but the diet appointed a&nbsp;committee to consider the matter and explain why they proposed to refuse the pope’s demands. Protests urging the diet&nbsp;not to weaken came in from all sides. There was an especially&nbsp;bitter denunciation of the Curia by some unknown writer. He&nbsp;claims that “ the pope bids his collectors go into the whole&nbsp;world, saying, 'He that believeth, and payeth the tenths, shall&nbsp;be saved.’ But it is not necessary to stand in such fear of the&nbsp;thunder of Christ’s vicar, but rather to fear Christ Himself,&nbsp;for it is the Florentine’s business, not Christ’s, that is at issue.”&nbsp;The report of the committee of the diet was completed on the&nbsp;27th of August 1518. It reviews all the abuses, declares that&nbsp;the German people are the victims of war, devastation and&nbsp;dearth, and that the common man is beginning to comment&nbsp;on the vast amount of wealth that is collected for expeditions&nbsp;against the Turk through indulgences or otherwise, and yet no&nbsp;expedition takes place. This is the first recognition in the&nbsp;official </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gravamina</span><span class="font0"> of the importance of the people. Shortly&nbsp;after the committee submitted its report the clergy of Liége&nbsp;presented a memorial which, as the ambassador from Frankfort&nbsp;observed, set forth in the best Latin all the various forms of&nbsp;rascality of which the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curtizanen</span><span class="font0"> (i.e. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curiales,</span><span class="font0"> officials of the&nbsp;curia) were guilty. From this time on three new streams begin&nbsp;to reinforce the rather feeble current of official efforts for reform.&nbsp;The common man, to whom the diet of Augsburg alludes, had&nbsp;long been raising his voice against the “parsons” (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pfaffen</span><span class="font0">);</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the men of letters, Brand, Erasmus, Reuchlin, and above all&nbsp;Ulrich von Hutten, contributed, each in their way, to discredit&nbsp;the Roman Curia; and lastly, a new type of theology, represented chiefly by Martin Luther, threatened to sweep away&nbsp;the very foundations of the papal monarchy.</span></p>
