 or <hi rend="italic">SIPUS</hi> (anc. geog.), a town of Apulia, ſo denominated (according to Strabo) from the great quantity of <hi rend="italic">ſepiae</hi> or cuttlefiſh that are thrown upon the coaſt. Diomed is ſuppoſed by the ſame author to have been the founder of this place;</p><p>which appears from Livy to have become a colony of Roman citizens. In the early ages of Chriſtian hierarchy, a biſhop was fixed in this church ; but, under the Lombards, his ſee was united to that of Beneventum. Being again ſeparated, Sipontum became an archiepiſcopal dioceſe in 1094, about which time it was ſo ill treated by the Barbarians, that it never recovered its ſplendour, but sunk into ſuch miſery, that in 1260 it was a mere desert, from the want of inhabitants, the decay of commerce, and the insalubrity of the air. Manfred having taken theſe circumſtances into conſideration, began in 1261 to build a new city on the ſea-ſhore, to which he removed the few remaining Sipontines. (See the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Manfredonia).</hi> Sipontum was ſituated at the diſtance of a mile from the ſhore. Excepting a part of its Gothic cathedral, ſcarce one ſtone of the ancient city now remains upon another.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
