<p><span class="font1">Giving Drink to the Thirsty, was made by Filippo Pala-dini of Pistoia in 1585; this last is of terra-cotta, not enamelled, but simply painted with oil colours. Giovanni&nbsp;also executed the medallions in the spandrels of the arches&nbsp;under this frieze, with reliefs of the Annunciation, the&nbsp;Visitation, and the Coronation of the Virgin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A large octagonal font of enamelled clay, with pilasters at the angles and panels between them with scenes from&nbsp;the life of the Baptist, in the church of S. Leonardo at&nbsp;Cerreto Guidi, is a work of the school of Giovanni ; the&nbsp;reliefs are pictorial in style and coarse in execution. Giovanni’s chief pupil was a man named Santi, who was at&nbsp;first apprenticed to Buglioni,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> and when the latter died in&nbsp;1521 lie went into Giovanni’s bottega. His work is very&nbsp;inferior to that of his master.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">VII. Girolamo della Robbia (1488-1566), another of Andrea’s sons, was an architect and a sculptor in marble&nbsp;and bronze as well as in enamelled clay. During the first&nbsp;part of his life he, like his brothers, worked with his father,&nbsp;but in 1528 he went to France and spent nearly forty&nbsp;years in the service of the French royal family. Francis&nbsp;I. employed him to build a palace in the Bois de Boulogne&nbsp;called the Château de Madrid. This was a large well-designed building, four stories high, two of them having&nbsp;open loggie in the Italian fashion. Girolamo decorated it&nbsp;richly with terra-cotta medallions, friezes, and other architectural features.</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>2</sup> For this purpose he set up kilns at&nbsp;Suresnes.

<p><span class="font0">The best collections of Robbia ware are in the Florentine Bargello and Accademia, the South Kensington Museum (the finest out of&nbsp;Italy), the Louvre, the Cluny, and the Berlin Museums. Many&nbsp;fine specimens exist in Paris in the private collections of M. Alphonse&nbsp;de Rothschild, M. Gavel, and M. Dreyfus. The greater part of&nbsp;the Robbia work still remains in the churches and other buildings&nbsp;of Italy, especially in Florence, Fiesole, Arezzo, La Verna, Volterrä,&nbsp;Barga, Montepulciano, Lucca, Pistoia, Prato, and Siena.

<p><span class="font1">ROBERT, called The Bruce</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>4</sup></span><span class="font1"> (1274-1329), king of Scotland, was the son of the seventh Robert de Bruce,&nbsp;lord of Annandale in his own right and earl of Carrick in&nbsp;right of his wife Marjory, daughter of Neil, second earl,&nbsp;and thus was of mingled Norman </span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>5</sup> and Celtic blood. His&nbsp;grandfather, the sixth Robert de Bruce, claimed the crown&nbsp;of Scotland as son of Isabella, second daughter of David,&nbsp;earl of Huntingdon ; but Baliol, grandson of Margaret, the&nbsp;eldest daughter, was preferred by the commissioners of&nbsp;Edward I. The birthplace of the Bruce—perhaps Turn-berry, his mother’s castle, on the coast of Ayr—is not certainly known. His youth is said by an English chronicle&nbsp;to have been passed at the court of Edward I. At an&nbsp;age when the mind is quick to receive the impressions&nbsp;which give the bent to life he must have watched the progress of the great suit for the crown of Scotland. Its&nbsp;issue in favour of Baliol led to the resignation of Annandale by Bruce the competitor to his son, the Bruce’s father,&nbsp;who, either then or after the death of the aged competitor&nbsp;in 1295, assumed the title of lord of Annandale. Two&nbsp;years before he had resigned, on the death of his wife, the&nbsp;earldom of Carrick to Robert the Bruce, who presented&nbsp;the deed of resignation to Baliol at Stirling on 3d August&nbsp;1293, and offered the homage which his father, like his&nbsp;grandfather, was unwilling to render. Feudal law required&nbsp;that the king should take sasine of the earldom before&nbsp;regranting it and receiving the homage, and the sheriff of&nbsp;Ayr was directed to take it on Baliol’s behalf. As the&nbsp;disputes between Edward and Baliol, which ended in Baliol&nbsp;losing the kingdom, commenced in this year it is doubtful&nbsp;whether Bruce ever rendered homage ; but he is henceforth&nbsp;known as earl of Carrick, though in a few instances this&nbsp;title is still given to his father. Both father and son sided&nbsp;with Edward against Baliol. Towards the end of 1292&nbsp;the elder Robert had a safe-conduct from Edward to visit&nbsp;Norway with a daughter, Isabella, who married Erik, king&nbsp;of Norway, the widower of Margaret of Scotland,—a fact&nbsp;marking the high standing of the family of Bruce. On&nbsp;20th April 1294 the younger Robert, earl of Carrick, had&nbsp;a similar safe-conduct or permission to visit Ireland till&nbsp;Michaelmas and a year following, and a further mark of&nbsp;Edward’s favour by a respite for the same period of all&nbsp;debts due by him to the exchequer. His father, having&nbsp;done homage to Edward, was entrusted in October 1295&nbsp;with the custody of the castle of Carlisle by a patent in&nbsp;which he is styled lord of Annandale; and Baliol retaliated&nbsp;by seizing Annandale, which he conferred on John Cornyn,&nbsp;earl of Buchan. On 28th August 1296 Robert de Bruce&nbsp;“ le vieil ” and Robert de Bruce “ le jeune,” earl of Carrick,&nbsp;swore fealty to Edward at Berwick ; but (according to&nbsp;Hemingford), in breach of this oath, renewed at Carlisle&nbsp;on the Gospels and the sword of Thomas a Becket, the&nbsp;young earl joined Wallace, who had raised the standard&nbsp;of Scottish independence in the name of Baliol after that&nbsp;weak king had himself surrendered his kingdom to&nbsp;Edward. Urgent letters were sent ordering Bruce to support Warenne, Edward’s general, in the summer of 1297;&nbsp;but, instead of complying, he, along with the bishop of&nbsp;Glasgow and the steward of Scotland, laid waste the lands&nbsp;of those who adhered to Edward. On 7th July Percy&nbsp;forced Bruce and his friends to make terms by the treaty&nbsp;called the Capitulation of Irvine. The Scottish lords were&nbsp;not to serve beyond the sea against their will and were&nbsp;pardoned for their recent violence, while in return they&nbsp;owned allegiance to Edward. The bishop of Glasgow, the&nbsp;steward, and Sir Alexander Lindesay became sureties for&nbsp;Bruce until he delivered his daughter Marjory as a hostage.&nbsp;Wallace almost alone maintained the struggle for freedom&nbsp;which the nobles as well as Baliol had given up, and Bruce&nbsp;had no part in the honour of Stirling Bridge or the reverse&nbsp;of Falkirk, where in the following year Edward in person&nbsp;recovered what his generals had lost and drove Wallace&nbsp;into exile. Shortly afterwards Bruce appears again to&nbsp;have sided with his countrymen ; Annandale was wasted&nbsp;and Lochmaben taken by Clifford, while Bruce (according</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>5</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first Robert de Bruce, a follower of William the Conqueror,&nbsp;was rewarded by the gift of many manors, chiefly in Yorkshire, of&nbsp;which Skelton was the principal. His son, the second Robert, received&nbsp;from David I., his comrade at the court of Henry I., a grant of the&nbsp;lordship of Annandale, and his grandson, the third Robert, siding&nbsp;with David against Stephen at the battle of the Standard, became a&nbsp;Scottish instead of an English baron. The fourth Robert maιτied&nbsp;Isobel, natural daughter of William the Lion, and their son, the fifth&nbsp;Robert, married Isabella, second daughter of David, earl of Huntingdon, niece of the same Scottish king. Thus royal kin made natural&nbsp;the ambition to gain a crown,—an object not beyond the ambition of&nbsp;a powerful noble in feudal times.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
