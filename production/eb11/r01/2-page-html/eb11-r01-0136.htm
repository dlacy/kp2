<p><span class="font2">RAPE, a territorial division of the county of Sussex, England, formerly used for various administrative purposes. There are&nbsp;now six of these divisions, Hastings, Pevensey, Lewes, Bramber,&nbsp;Arundel and Chichester, but the latter two apparently formed a&nbsp;single rape at the date of the compilation of Domesday Book.&nbsp;The word, which in England is peculiar to Sussex, is usually said&nbsp;to be closely related to the Icelandic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">hrepp,</span><span class="font2"> a small territorial&nbsp;division which in most, but not in all, cases is identical with the&nbsp;parish; but this explanation, which is unsatisfactory on institutional grounds, has also been declared impossible for philological reasons. As an alternative explanation it has been&nbsp;suggested, that “ rape ’’ is an early form of the word “ rope ’’;&nbsp;and that the divisions were so called because they were measured&nbsp;and allotted by the rope. Some confirmation of this is to be&nbsp;found in the words of the Norman chronicler, Dudo of St&nbsp;Quentin, who states that Rollo in distributing Neustria “ suis&nbsp;fidelibus terram funiculo divisit ’’ (J. P. Migne, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Patrologiae&nbsp;Cursus completus,</span><span class="font2"> tom. cxli. p. 652). It is possible that the&nbsp;rapes represent the shires of the ancient kingdom of Sussex,&nbsp;especially as in the 12th century they had sheriffs of their own.&nbsp;But there is no evidence of the existence of the rape before the&nbsp;Norman Conquest, except such as may be gathered from&nbsp;Domesday Book, and this is far from convincing. After the&nbsp;Conquest each rape had its own lord, and all the land within it,&nbsp;save that which belonged to the king or to ecclesiastical tenants,&nbsp;was held of the lord. Thus the rape as a lordship only differed&nbsp;from other honours and baronies by the fact that the lands of&nbsp;its knights were not scattered over England, but lay together in&nbsp;a continuous tract. In form the rapes were parallel bands of land&nbsp;running north and south, and each of them contained a different&nbsp;number of hundreds. The place in which the lord’s castle was&nbsp;situate ultimately gave its name to the rape; but in Domesday&nbsp;Book the rapes are often described by the names of their lords,&nbsp;and this is always so in that work in the case of Bramber, which&nbsp;belonged to William de Briouze </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(rapam Willelmi de Braoza</span><span class="font2">)</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAPE OIL, an important fatty oil, known also as “ sweet oil,” either expressed or extracted from the crushed seeds of cultivated varieties of the cruciferous genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Brassica,</span><span class="font2"> the parent&nbsp;form of the whole apparently being the wild navew, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">B. campestris.</span><span class="font2"> Under the general name “ rape oil ’’ is included the produce of several plants having distinct and fairly constant&nbsp;characters, and one of these oils—colza (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font2">)—is a very well-known commercial variety. In Germany, where the produc-tion of rape oil centres, two principal oil-seeds—rape and&nbsp;Rübsen—are well recognized. (See Rape.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The oil yielded by these seeds is, in physical and chemical properties, practically the same, the range of fluctuations not&nbsp;being greater than would be found in the oil of any specific seed&nbsp;under similar varying conditions of production; the winter&nbsp;varieties of all the seeds are more productive than the summer&nbsp;varieties. Newly pressed rape oil has a dark sherry colour&nbsp;with, at first, scarcely any perceptible smell; but after resting&nbsp;a short time the oil deposits an abundant mucilaginous slime,&nbsp;and by taking up oxygen it acquires a peculiar disagreeable&nbsp;odour and an acrid taste. Refined by the ordinary processes&nbsp;(see Oils), the oil assumes a clear golden yellow colour. In&nbsp;specific gravity it ranges between 0∙9112 and 0∙9117 in the raw&nbsp;state, and from 0.9127 to 0.9136 when refined; the solidifying&nbsp;point is from −4° to −6° C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The principal uses of rape oil are for lubrication and lighting; but since the introduction of mineral oils for both these purposes&nbsp;the importance of rape has considerably decreased. It is but little&nbsp;employed in soap-making, as it saponifies with difficulty and yields&nbsp;only an indifferent product. In Germany it is very considerably&nbsp;used as a salad oil under the name of Schmalzöl, being for that&nbsp;purpose freed from its biting taste by being mixed with starch,&nbsp;heated till the starch is carbonized, and filtered after the oil has&nbsp;cooled. The offensive taste of rape oil may also be removed by&nbsp;treatment with a small proportion of sweet spirit of nitre (nitrous&nbsp;ether). In the East Indies rape oil and its equivalents, known&nbsp;under various names, are the most important of oils for native use.&nbsp;They are largely consumed as food instead of ghi under the name&nbsp;of “ metah ” or sweet oil, but for all other purposes the same substance is known as “ kurwah ” or bitter oil. Most natives prefer it&nbsp;for the preparation of their curries and other hot dishes. Rape oil&nbsp;is the subject of extensive adulteration, principally with the cheaper&nbsp;hemp oil, rosin oil and mineral oils. These sophistications can be&nbsp;most conveniently detected, first by taste and next by saponification, rosin oil and mineral oil remaining unsaponified, hemp oil&nbsp;giving a greenish soap, while rape oil yields a soap with a yellow&nbsp;tinge. With concentrated sulphuric acid, fuming nitric acid,&nbsp;nitrous acid, and other reagents rape oil gives also characteristic&nbsp;colorations; but these are modified according to the degree of&nbsp;purity of the oil itself. The presence of sulphur in rape and other&nbsp;cruciferous oils also affords a ready means for their identification.&nbsp;Lead plaster (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">emplastrum lithargyri</span><span class="font1">) boiled in rape oil dissolves,&nbsp;and, sulphide of lead being formed, the oil becomes brown or&nbsp;black. Other lead compounds give the same black coloration from&nbsp;the formation of sulphide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAPHAEL (Hebrew ⅛n, “ God heals ’’), an angel who in human disguise and under the name of Azarias (“ Yahweh&nbsp;helps ’’) accompanies Tobias in his adventurous journey and&nbsp;conquers the demon Asmodaeus (Book of Tobit). He is said&nbsp;(Tob. xii. 15) to be “ one of the seven holy angels [archangels}&nbsp;which present the prayers of the saints and go in before the&nbsp;glory of the Holy One.” In the Book of Enoch (c. xx.) Raphael&nbsp;is “ the angel of the spirits of men,” and it is his business to&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">“ heal</span><span class="font2"> the earth which the angels have defiled.” In later&nbsp;Midrash Raphael appears as the angel commissioned to put down&nbsp;the evil spirits that vexed the sons of Noah with plagues and&nbsp;sicknesses after the Flood, and he it was who taught men the&nbsp;use of simples and furnished materials for the “ Book of Noah,”&nbsp;the earliest treatise on materia medica.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RAPHAEL SANZIO (1483-1520), the great Italian painter, was the son of Giovanni Sanzio or Santi, a painter of some&nbsp;repute in the ducal city of Urbino, situated among the Apen-nines on the borders of Tuscany and Umbria.@@<sup>1</sup> For many years&nbsp;both before and after the birth of Raphael (6th of April 1483)&nbsp;the city of Urbino was one of the chief centres in Italy of intellectual and artistic activity, thanks to its highly cultured rulers,&nbsp;Duke Federigo II. of Montefeltro and his son Guidobaldo, who&nbsp;succeeded him in 1482,@@<sup>2</sup> the year before Raphael was born.&nbsp;Giovanni Santi was a welcome guest at this miniature but&nbsp;splendid court, and the rich treasures which the palace contained,&nbsp;familiar to Raphael from his earliest years, were a very important item among the various influences which formed and&nbsp;fostered his early love for art. It may not perhaps be purely&nbsp;fanciful to trace Raphael’s boyish admiration of the oil-paintings&nbsp;of Jan Van Eyck and Justus of Ghent in the miniature-like care&nbsp;and delicacy with which some of his earliest works, such as the&nbsp;“ Apollo and Marsyas,” were executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Though Raphael lost his father at the age of eleven, yet to him he certainly owed a great part of that early training&nbsp;which enabled him to produce paintings of apparently mature&nbsp;beauty when he was scarcely twenty years of age. The altar-piece painted by Giovanni for the church of Gradara,&nbsp;and a fresco, now preserved in the Santi house@@<sup>3</sup> at Urbino,&nbsp;are clearly prototypes of some of Raphael’s most graceful</span></p>
