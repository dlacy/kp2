<p><span class="font1">Rodez, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Segodunum</span><span class="font1"> under the Gauls, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruthena</span><span class="font1"> under the Romans, was the capital of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rutheni<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font1"> a tribe allied to the Arverni<sub>t&nbsp;</sub>and was afterwards the principal town in the district of Rouergue.&nbsp;Jn the 4th century it adopted the Christian faith, and St Amans,&nbsp;its first bishop, was elected in 401. During the middle ages contests&nbsp;were rife between the bishops, who held the temporal power in the&nbsp;“cité,” and'the counts in the “bourg.” The Albigenses were&nbsp;defeated near Rodez in 1210. The countship of Rodez, detached&nbsp;from that of Rouergue at the end of the nth century, belonged&nbsp;first Vo the viscounts of Carlat, and from the beginning of the 14th&nbsp;century to the counts of Armagnac. From 1360 to 1368 the English&nbsp;held the town. After the confiscation of the estates of the Armagnacs&nbsp;in 1475 the countship passed to the dukes of Alençon and then to&nbsp;the D’/Mbrets. Henry lV. finally annexed it to the crown of France.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RODGERS, JOHN (1771-1838), American sailor, was born in Harford county, Maryland, on the nth of July 1771. Hc&nbsp;entered the United States navy when it was organized in 179S.&nbsp;IIe was second in command to Commodore James Barron&nbsp;(1769-1851) in the expedition against the Barbary pirates,&nbsp;and succeeded him in the command in 1805. In this year he&nbsp;brought both Tunis and Tripoli to terms, and then returned to&nbsp;America. In 1811 he was in command as commodore of the U.S.&nbsp;frigate “ President ” (44) off Annapolis when he heard that an&nbsp;American seaman had been “ pressed ” by a British frigate&nbsp;off Sandy Hook. Commodore Rodgers was ordered to sea&nbsp;“ to protect American commerce,” but he may have had verbal&nbsp;instructions to retaliate for the impressment of real or supposed&nbsp;British subjects out of American vessels, which was causing&nbsp;much ill-feeling and was a main cause of the War of 1812.&nbsp;On the 16th of May 1811 he sighted and followed the British&nbsp;sloop “ Little Belt ” (22), and after some hailing and counter-hailing, of which very different versions are given on either&nbsp;side, a gun was fired, each side accusing the other of the&nbsp;aggression, and an action ensued in which the “ Little Belt ”&nbsp;was cut to pieces. The incident, which was represented as an&nbsp;accident by the Americans, and believed to be a deliberate&nbsp;aggression by the British navy, had a share in bringing on&nbsp;war. When hostilities broke out Rodgers commanded a&nbsp;squadron on the coast of America, and was wounded by the&nbsp;bursting of one of his guns while pursuing the British frigate&nbsp;“ Belvedere.” He was subsequently President of the Board&nbsp;of Navy Commissioners in 1815-1824 and in 1827-1837, and&nbsp;acting secretary of the navy in 1823 for two weeks. He died&nbsp;in Philadelphia on the ist of August 1838.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His brother, George Washington Rodgers (1787-1832), a brother-in-law of Commodore Perry, served in the War of 1812&nbsp;and in the war with Algiers (1815). Rear-Admiral John Rodgers&nbsp;(1812-1882), a son of Commodore John Rodgers,' served in the&nbsp;Union navy and in 1877-1882 was superintendent of the Naval&nbsp;Observatory at Washington. G. W. Rodgers had two sons&nbsp;who were naval officers, Christopher Raymond Perry Rodgers&nbsp;(1819-1892) and George Washington Rodgers (1822-1863).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RODIN, AUGUSTE (1840- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">), French sculptor, was born</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in 1840, in Paris, and at an early age displayed a taste for his art. He began by attending Barye’s classes, but did not yield&nbsp;too completely to his influence. From 1864 to 1870, under&nbsp;pressure of necessity, he was employed in the studio of Carrier-Bellcuse, where he learnt to deal with the mechanical difficulties&nbsp;of a sculptor. Even so early as 1864 his individuality was&nbsp;manifested in his “ Man with a Broken Nose.” After the war,&nbsp;finding nothing to do in Paris, Rodin went to Brussels, where&nbsp;from 1871 to 1877 he worked, as the colleague of the Belgian&nbsp;artist Van Rasbourg, on the sculpture for the outside and the&nbsp;caryatides for the interior of the Bourse, besides exhibiting&nbsp;in 1875 a “ Portrait of Gamier.” In 1877 he contributed to&nbsp;the Salon “ The Bronze Age,” which was seen again, cast in&nbsp;bronze, at the Salon of 1880, when it took a third-class medal,&nbsp;was purchased by the State, and is now in the museum of the&nbsp;Luxembourg. Between 1882 and 1885 he sent to the Salons&nbsp;busts of “ Jean-Paul Laurens ” and “ Carrier-BelIeuse ” (1882),&nbsp;“ Victor Hugo ” and “ Dalou ” (1884), and “ Antonin IToust ”&nbsp;(1885). From about this time he chiefly devoted himself to&nbsp;a great decorative composition six metres high, which was not&nbsp;finished for twenty years. This is the “ Portal of Hell,” the&nbsp;most elaborate perhaps of all Rodin’s works, executed to order&nbsp;for the Musée des arts décoratifs. It is inspired mainly by&nbsp;Dante’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inferno,</span><span class="font1"> the poet himself being seated at the top,&nbsp;while at his feet, in under-cut relief, we sec the writhing crowd&nbsp;of the damned, torn by the frenzy of passion and the anguish&nbsp;of despair. The lower part consists of two bas-reliefs, in their&nbsp;midst two masks of tormented faces. Round these run figures&nbsp;of women and centaurs. Above the door three men cling to&nbsp;each other in an attitude of despair. After beginning this&nbsp;titanic undertaking, and while continuing to work on it, Rodin&nbsp;executed for the town of Damvillers a statue of “ Bastien-Lepagc for Nancy a “ Monument to Claude Ie Lorrain,”&nbsp;representing the Chariot of the Sun drawn by horses; and for&nbsp;Calais “ The Burgesses of Calais ” surrendering the keys of the&nbsp;town and imploring mercy. In this, Rodin, throwing over&nbsp;all school tradition, represents the citizens not as grouped on a&nbsp;square or circular plinth, but walking in file. This work was&nbsp;exhibited at the Petit Gallery in 1889. At the time of the&nbsp;secession of the National Society of Fine Arts, or New Salon, in&nbsp;1890, Rodin withdrew from the old Society of French Artists,&nbsp;and exhibited in the New Salon the bust of his friend “ Puvis&nbsp;de Chavannes ” (1892), “ Contemplation ” and a “ Caryatid,”&nbsp;both in marble, and the “ Monument to Victor Hugo ” (1897),&nbsp;intended for the gardens of the Luxembourg. In this the poet&nbsp;is represented nude, as a powerful old man extending his right&nbsp;arm with a sovereign gesture, the Muses standing behind&nbsp;him. In 1898 Rodin exhibited two very dissimilar works,&nbsp;“ The Kiss,” exhibited again in 1900, a marble group representing Paolo Malatesta and Francesca da Rimini, and the sketch&nbsp;in plaster for a “ Statue of Balzac.” This statue, a commission&nbsp;from the Society of Men of Letters, had long been expected,&nbsp;and was received with vehement dissensions. Some critics&nbsp;regarded this work, in which Balzac was represented in his&nbsp;voluminous dressing-gown, as the first-fruits of a new phase&nbsp;of sculpture; others, on the contrary, declared that it was&nbsp;incomprehensible, if not ridiculous. This was the view taken&nbsp;by the society who had ordered it, and who “ refused to recognize&nbsp;Rodin’s rough sketch as a statue of Balzac, ” and withdrew the&nbsp;commission, giving it to the sculptor Falguiêre. Falguière&nbsp;exhibited his model in 1899. In the same Salon, Rodin, to prove&nbsp;that the conduct of the society had made no change in his friendship with Falguière, exhibited a bust in bronze of his rival,&nbsp;as well as one of “ Henri Rochefort.” In 1900, the city of Paris,&nbsp;to do honour to Rodin, erected at its own expense a building&nbsp;close to one of the entrances to the Great Exhibition, in which&nbsp;almost all of the works of the artist were to be seen, more&nbsp;especially the great “ Portal of Hell,” still quite incomplete,&nbsp;the “ Balzac,” and a host of other works, many of them unfinished&nbsp;or mere rough sketches. Here, too, were to be seen some of&nbsp;Rodin’s designs, studies and water-colour drawings. He has&nbsp;also executed a great many etchings and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sgraffiti</span><span class="font1"> on porcelain&nbsp;for the manufactory at Sèvres. His best-known etching is the&nbsp;portrait of Victor Hugo. Many of Rodin’s works are in private&nbsp;collections, and at the Luxembourg he is represented by a&nbsp;“ DanaId ” (in marble), a “Saint John” (in bronze, 1880),&nbsp;“ She who made the Helmet ” (bronze statuette), the busts of&nbsp;“ J. P. Laurens ” and of “ A Lady ” and other works. In the&nbsp;Musée Galliera is a very fine bust of Victor Hugo. Rodin’s&nbsp;“ Hand of God ” was exhibited in the New Gallery, London,&nbsp;in 1905. In 1904 Mr Ernest Beckett (Lord Grimthorpe) presented the British nation with the sculptor’s “ Le Penseur.”&nbsp;In the same year Rodin became president of the International&nbsp;Society of Sculptors, Painters and Engravers, in succession to&nbsp;James McNeill Whistler.</span></p>
