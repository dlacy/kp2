<p><span class="font2">by regulation works, which have been carried out below St Paul in shallow and shifting reaches, with the object of obtaining a minimum navigable depth during the low stage of 6 ft. along the upper&nbsp;river from St Paul to St Louis just below the confluence of the&nbsp;Missouri, and 8 ft. thence to Cairo at the mouth of the Ohio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Various materials are used for the regulation works according to the respective conditions and the materials available in the locality.&nbsp;On the Rhone below Lyons with its rapid current, the dikes have&nbsp;been constructed of rubble-stone, consolidated above low water&nbsp;with concrete. The dikes on the Rhine consist for the most part&nbsp;of earthwork mounds protected by a layer of rubble-stone or pitching on the face, with a rubble mound forming the toe exposed to&nbsp;. the current; but occasionally fascines arc employed in conjunction&nbsp;with stone or simple rubble mounds. The dams closing subsidiary&nbsp;channels on the Mississippi are almost always constructed of fascine&nbsp;mattresses weighted with stone; but whereas the regulating dikes&nbsp;on the upper nver are Iisually similar in construction, a common&nbsp;form for dikes in the United States consists of two parallel rows of&nbsp;piles filled in between with brushwood or other materials not affected&nbsp;by water, and protected at the sides from scour by an apron of&nbsp;fascines and stone.. Other forms of dikes sometimes used arc&nbsp;timber cribs filled with stone, single rows of sheet piling, permeable&nbsp;dikes composed of piles supporting thin curtains of brushwood for&nbsp;promoting silting at the sides, and occasionally rubble-stone in</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">places needing special protection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Protecting and Easing Bends.—</span><span class="font2">Unless the concave banks of a river winding through wide, alluvial plains are protected from the scour&nbsp;of the current, the increasing curvature presents serious impediments&nbsp;to navigation, sometimes eventually becoming so intensified that&nbsp;the river at last makes a short cut for itself across the narrow strip&nbsp;of land at the base of the loop it has formed. This, however, produces considerable changes in the channel below, and disturbances&nbsp;in the navigable depth. Protection, accordingly, of concave banks&nbsp;is necessary to prevent excessive curvature, of the channel and&nbsp;chances in the course of a river. On the MississiDDi the verv easilv</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">eroded banks are protected along their upper, steeper part by stone pitching or a layer of concrete, and below low-water level by fascine&nbsp;mattresses weighted with stone, extended, a short distance, out on&nbsp;the bed to prevent erosion at the toe. Dikes, also, projecting into&nbsp;the channel from, the banks, reduce the. curvature of the navigable&nbsp;channel by pushing the main current into a more central course;&nbsp;whilst curved longitudinal dikes placed in the channel in front of&nbsp;concave banks (figs. 4 and 6) are still, more effective in keeping the&nbsp;current away from the banks, which is sometimes still further promoted by dipping cross dikes in front (fig. 5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Regulation of Depth.—</span><span class="font2">The regulation works at bends, besides arresting erosion, also reduce the differences in depth at the bends&nbsp;and the crossings, since they diminish the excessive depth round&nbsp;the. concave banks and deepen the channel along the crossings, by&nbsp;giving a Straighter course to the current and concentrating it&nbsp;by a reduction in width of the channel between the bends (figs. 4&nbsp;and 5). Where there are deep pools at intervals in a river, shoals are&nbsp;always found above them, owing to the increased fall which occurs&nbsp;in the water line on approaching the pool, to compensate for the very&nbsp;slight inclination of the water-line in crossing the pool, which serves&nbsp;for the discharge of the river through the ample cross-section of&nbsp;this part of the river-bed. These variable depths can be regulated&nbsp;to some extent by rubble dikes or fascine mattress sills deposited&nbsp;across the bed of the pool, so as to reduce its excessive depth, but not&nbsp;raised high enough to interfere at all with the navigable depth.&nbsp;These obstructions in the pool raise the water-line towards its upper&nbsp;end, in order to provide the additional fall needed to effect the&nbsp;discharge through the pool with its diminished cross section; and&nbsp;this raising of the water-line increases the depth over the shoal&nbsp;above, the. pool, so that the general depth in these irregular parts&nbsp;of a river is rendered more uniform, with benefit to navigation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Canalization of Rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rivers whose discharge is liable to become quite small at their low stage, or which have a somewhat large fall, as is&nbsp;■ usual in the upper part of rivers, cannot be given an adequate&nbsp;depth for navigation by regulation works alone; and their</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ordinary summer level has to be raised by impounding the flow with weirs at intervals across the channel (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Weir),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">while a lock (sec </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Canal</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dock)</span><span class="font2"> has to be provided alongside&nbsp;the weir, or in a side channel, to provide for the passage of&nbsp;vessels (fig. 8). A river is thereby converted into a succession&nbsp;of fairly level reaches rising in steps up-stream, providing&nbsp;a comparatively still-water navigation like a canal; but it&nbsp;differs from a canal in the introduction of weirs for keeping&nbsp;up the water-level, in the provision for the regular discharge&nbsp;of the river at the weirs, and in the two sills of the locks being&nbsp;laid at the same level instead of the upper sill being raised&nbsp;above the lower one to the extent of the rise at the lock, as&nbsp;usual on canals. Canalization secures a definite available&nbsp;depth for navigation; and the discharge of the river generally&nbsp;is amply sufficient for maintaining the impounded water-level, as w<sup>r</sup>ell as providing the necessary water for locking.&nbsp;The navigation, however, is liable to be stopped during the&nbsp;descent of high floods, which in many cases rise above the locks&nbsp;(fig. 7); and it is necessarily arrested in cold climates on all&nbsp;rivers by long, severe frosts, and especially on the break-up </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the ice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Instances of Canalized Rivers.—</span><span class="font2">Many small rivers, like the Thames above its tidal, limit, have been rendered navigable by canalization,&nbsp;and several fairly large rivers have thereby provided a good depth&nbsp;for vessels for considerable distances inland. Thus the canalized&nbsp;Seine has.secured a navigable depth of 10J ft. from its tidal limit&nbsp;up to Paris, a distance of 135 m., and a depth of 6J ft. up to Mon-tereau, 62 m. higher up. Regulation works for improving the&nbsp;river Main, from its confluence with the Rhine opposite Mainz up</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">to Frankfort, having failed to secure a minimum depth of 3 ft. at the low stage of the river,, canalization works were carried out in&nbsp;1883-86 by means of five w'eirs in the 22 m. between the Rhine and&nbsp;Frankfort, and provided a minimum depth of 6J ft. (figs. 7 and 8).</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Fig. 8.—Locks, Weir and Haven near Frankfort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This depth was subsequently increased by dredging the shoaler portion towards the upper end of each reach, due to the rise of the&nbsp;river-bed up-stream, so as to attain a minimum depth of 7J ft. just&nbsp;below the lowest lock, and 7| to 8J ft. in the other reaches; whilst&nbsp;a sixth weir was erected, at Offenbarh above Frankfort (fig. 7).&nbsp;The Great Kanawha, Ohio, and other rivers, furnish instances of&nbsp;canalization works in the United States.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Limits to Canalization.—</span><span class="font2">On ascending a river it becomes increasingly difficult to obtain a good depth by canalization in the upper part, owing to the progressive inclination of the river-bed; thus, even&nbsp;on the Seine, w<sup>r</sup>ith its moderate fall, whereas a depth of 10J ft. has&nbsp;been obtained on the Lower Seine by weirs placed on the average&nbsp;I3i m. apart, on the Upper Seine weirs are required at intervals of&nbsp;only about 4$ m. to attain a depth of 6Î ft. Accordingly, the&nbsp;higher parts of rivers are only suitable for floating down trunks of&nbsp;trees felled on the hills, or rough rafts of timber, conveying small&nbsp;loads of produce, which are broken ud on reaching their destination.&nbsp;Moreover, sometimes an abrupt fall or rocky shoals make it necessary&nbsp;to abandon a section of the nver and to continue the navigation by&nbsp;lateral canal.</span></p>
