a periodical wind which generally blows in Italy and Dalmatia every year about Eaſter. It blows from the ſouth-eaſt by ſouth : it is attended with heat, but not rain ; its ordinary period is twenty days, and it uſually ceaſes at ſunset.<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Fortis's Travels into Dalmatia, p. 277.</p></note> When the ſcirocco does not blow in this manner, the ſummer is almoſt free from weſterly winds, whirlwinds, and ſtorms. This wind is prejudicial to plants, drying and burning up the buds ; though it hurts not men any otherwise than by cauſing an extraordinary weakneſs and laſſitude; inconveniences that are fully compenſated by a plentiful fiſhing, and a good crop of corn on the mountains. In the ſummer time, when the weſterly wind ceaſes for a day, it is a ſign that the firocco will blow the day following, which uſually begins with a sort of whirlwind.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
