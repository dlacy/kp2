In the last one, no mention is made of the silver and copper mines of the Urals, which, however, are less important than those of gold and platina. The quantities which they produce have already been stated. In 1832, the latest year for which we have complete returns, the number of vessels which arrived in the different ports of Russia was as follows :—</p><p>Ports on    the Baltic Sea...................3601</p><p>Ditto on    the White Sea................... 472</p><p>Ditto on    the Black Sea....................1446</p><p>Ditto on    the Caspian Sea................. 201</p><p>Total.........5720</p><p>It may be mentioned, that there is little difference between the commercial returns of 1834 and those of 1835. Still, taking a series of years, Russia will be found to be steadily and widely extending her commercial relations. The receipts of the custom-house in 1835 amounted to 46,763,444 roubles, and in 1836 to 48,968,790 roubles, or L.2,142,384, which is an increase of 2,205,346 roubles in one year. By far the most important of the commercial relations of Russia are those which she has with Great Britain. The interests of the two greatest empires in the world are thus pretty closely united ; and there appears to us to be little cause for dreading aggressive hostility on the part of a power which draws half its custom-house revenue from British imports, and sends to Britain one half of all the raw produce which it can raise for exportation. After all, the commerce of Russia is not one third of that of France, and not one seventh of that of Great Britain.</p><p>The nobles in Russia, though distinguished by the several titles of prince, count, or baron, are all upon an equal footing, and enjoy equal privileges. Their persons and lands are freed from taxation ; they are exempted from the recruiting ballot ; and they are not subject to bodily penalties. These exemptions are, however, more apparent than real ; for though their lands and persons are not taxable, yet a capitation tax, at the will of the government, may be imposed on their slaves, who form the most valuable part of their possessions. Though not in person compelled to serve in the army, yet they are bound to furnish from their slaves a number of recruits, in proportion to the demands of the service. In some of the more recently-acquired provinces, such as Livonia, Esthonia, and in Poland, the nobles have, or rather exercise, other privileges, extending even to the power of life and death, over their vassals ; but these powers arise from custom and general acquiescence much more than from the existing law. The classes of the nobility are very numerous, being fourteen in all ; but, singularly enough, some of them have no members. Thus, of the eleventh and thirteenth none are alive. Although titles are hereditary, there is no rank except what the emperor confers. Most of the public employments are filled by the nobles ; but no one whatever is eligible to such appointments unless he belongs to one of the fourteen classes of rank into which the civil and military services, and the clergy, are correspondingly arranged. A fixed term of service, and a prescribed form of examination, are undergone previously to acquiring rank. The right of conferring nobility rests with the emperor, and, as with us, it is hereditary.</p><p>The clergy are exempt from taxation, and from corporal punishment ; which privileges are extended to each eldest son, who must, however, though his father is excused, take the risk of being called upon for military service.</p><p>The citizens form the second grand division of the Russian nation. Every inhabitant of a town, who is neither noble, nor the property of another, is a citizen. The notables constitute the highest class amongst them, and possess privileges similar to those of the nobles. Next to these</p><p>come the merchants of the three guilds. The first or highest guild corresponds with the eighth class of rank, and en- ' joys most of the immunities of the notables. In fact, whoever has belonged ten years to the first guild, or twenty to the second, without incurring any visitation of the law, becomes a notable. For an account of the merchants of these guilds, see the article Petersburg.</p><p>The next class is that of the peasants, or free inhabitants of the country. In this rank are included, first, the ancient race of proprietors, who cultivate their own lands, but do not enjoy the right of possessing slaves; second, the Tartars, the Baschkirs, and several other races, less numerous, to the south of Siberia, who are all proprietors of the lands they cultivate ; and, third, the peasants of Finland. Since the acquisition of New Finland, the privileges enjoyed by the peasants of that country under the Swedish government have been continued and confirmed to them, and the same rights granted to those of Old Finland, where all are now either proprietors or renters. There is a considerable number of rent peasants, who, by paying an annual sum to their proprietors, purchase the right of carrying on trade or business on their own account. Some of these have been known to amass considerable property ; but they still remain slaves. In the fourth are included the colonists, consisting of foreign families of agriculturists, who are proprietors of the lands they cultivate, and whose number is about 65,000. The fifth embraces the military colonists. These are soldiers, who, after having served a prescribed period, have had land given to them, and a capital sufficient to cultivate it, in the southern provinces. And, lastly, the free cultivators, who enjoy immunity from taxes, on condition of keeping post-horses for the public service, which they furnish at a charge regulated by government.</p><p>The class next below these is that of the serfs. They are chiefly peasants on the crown-lands, or of the province of Livonia. The first of these, the crown-peasants, amount to about 12,000,000, some of whom labour in the fields, and the others in the mines and manufactories. The lot of this class seems to be placed on the confines between liberty and slavery. They may rise to the rank of citizens, they may acquire property, they may enjoy the protection of the laws, and, under some restrictions, may quit their residences to obtain employment for a limited time; but they are liable to be hired to the service of the mines, or to be sold. The peasants of Livonia, amounting to about 560,000, were slaves until the year 1804, when they first obtained the rights of serfs. They are now subject to some peculiar claims ; but those claims are fixed, and they cannot be removed from the soil without their own consent.</p><p>The last and most numerous class is that of the slaves. These amounted in 1782 to 6,678,000 males, and at present are estimated to include 23,000,000 persons. They are in law considered as <hi rend="italic">things,</hi>  not as persons ; they are attached to the soil, and incapable of possessing any property in land ; they may be bought, sold, or exchanged, with little more restrictions than are enacted in dealing for cattle; and they have no other protection against their masters than what is created by a regard to their pecuniary interest. They belong to the nobles, or to such civil or military officers as have acquired the right of possessing them. They are divided into agricultural, mining, manufacturing, or domestic slaves, and have their condition only improved when drawn for military service.</p><p>“ A Russian proprietor,” says a recent traveller, “ reckons the value of his property, not by the annual income of his estate, but by the number of souls, that is, of male peasants upon it. An estate is said to be worth so many souls instead of so many roubles per annum. The footing on which the agricultural serf practically stands towards his master, is in most respects that of a small tenant ; the principal difference being, that he cannot change his employment or</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
