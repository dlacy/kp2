In particular, she has an imagination singularly alive to natural beauty ; her pictures of scenery are frequently captivating; and one evening landscapeof Venice, in her <hi rend="italic">Lettres Venetiennes,</hi>  has the combined charm of deep sensibility and truth. By far the most pleasing of her novels, because it in a great measure keeps in tlle background her peculiar opinions, is <hi rend="italic">André.</hi>  And yet even the general purity and right feeling of the tale is marred and interrupted by some passages which English readers at least would wish to blot.</p><p>The field of the novel or romance is not that which has been cultivated in Germany with the most success. The labourers indeed have been many, the produce most abundant, but the quality of the harvest is at best equivocal. Down to the time of Goethe and Tieck, the German literature of fiction was almost entirely imitative, deriving both its form and spirit from other nations. Since their time, if it presents a greater air of originality, it has generally assumed a character so fantastic, so unreal, so unlike all that we have been accustomed to associate with the idea of a novel, that it is extremely difficult to comprehend what is really the conception of the word entertained in Germany.</p><p>As we have no very high idea of the German prose fictions, the space which we propose to devote to them will be extremely limited ; for we shall confine ourselves to a mere indication of the successive phases which the German romance has presented. In doing so, it seems unnecessary to go back beyond the latter portion of the eighteenth century, or to revive the names of w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>orks and authors which even the Germans themselves have forgotten, The earlier part of the eighteenth century had been occupied with numerous imitations of the<hi rend="italic">Robinson Cmsοe </hi>of Defoe, or of the family pictures of Richardson, the merits of which are not of a nature to demand notice in the present sketch.</p><p>In the Greek romances of Wieland, (1763—1812), such as the <hi rend="italic">Agathon,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Aristippus, Peregrinus Proteus,</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Agαthodiimoη,</hi>  the same didactic tendency is observable which distinguishes those of Voltaire, but without their cy-nyical and mocking tone, and with a much greater power, if not of actually inventing character, at least of working up the scanty materials furnished by history into a consistent and plausible portrait of the historical personages of antiquity; as in his <hi rend="italic">Socrates,</hi>  and still more perhaps in his <hi rend="italic">Aristippus.</hi>  The main fault of his novels, besides this didactic tone, which pervades them all, is the frequent repetitions which they contain of the same views and personages. <hi rend="italic">Agathon</hi>  in one manner, and the <hi rend="italic">Abderites</hi>  in the other, contain the germ of almost all Wieland’s other writings. The sceptical Hippias, for instance, only puts off’ the Athenian stole in Agathon, to assume the mantle of tlle Calendar ; the Danæ of that novel revives again in Theo-clea and Devidassi ; the youth of Athagon, in Delphi, is the prototype of that of Peregrinus in Parium ; and many such instances must occur to any one familiar with Wieland. He is a mannerist, in short, as to his matter, and the mannerism extends even to his style, which, though flowing and facile, has not a little of the solemn loquacity of Boc-c lccio. This diffuseness is less felt in his shorter tales, where his philosophy is not so obtrusively displayed ; and for this reason we prefer hisZ&gt;on <hi rend="italic">Sylvia de Rοsαlvα,—</hi>the history of a quixotic believer in fairyism, gradually converted to common sense by the extravagant demands which are made upon his belief, assisted by the charms of a mortal beauty,— and his little romance of the <hi rend="italic">Salamander and the Statue, </hi>to his more elaborate and aspiring compositions.</p><p>The influence of the novels of Richardson and of Fielding reappears about this time in a liberal effusion of family novels, some pourtraying the serious and sentimental, others the comic aspect of domestic life. Among the sentimental novelists, Augustus La Fontaine (1758—1831) may be considered as the most successful, and undoubtedly the most popular. He painted life as he had seen it iii the little German towns, villages, and chateaux of respectable proprietors about him, or as he had witnessed it during his campaigns as army chaplain, without ornament or alteration, without any pretension to imagination ; and though there is at times something vulgar and tawdry in his sentimentalism, there is also a great deal of quiet simple nature in such scenes of common life and domestic happiness as he has exhibited in his family of Haller ; and a tone of frankness and good humour, which carries the reader pleasingly along through incidents and characters that in themselves are common-place enough.</p><p>The comedy of family life found numerous representatives, of whom Wetzel, Müller, Schulz, and Hippel, attracted some notice in their day and generation. Even yet the <hi rend="italic">Siegfried von Lindenberg</hi>  of Müller, which appeared about 1779, and of which many editions have appeared, may be admitted to be a natural and amusing performance.</p><p>A union of the sentimental with the comic in these domestic pictures was attempted at a somewhat later date in thc very singular novels of Richter, (1763—1825), a man of high powers, which he knew not how to use. and which were alloyed in no common degree by false taste, and an incurable affectation of singularity. His earliest novel, the <hi rend="italic">Gronlαndische Processe,</hi>  appeared in 1784. The tricks and claptraps to which Sterne occasionally descends, we find habitual with Richter. The very titles of some of his works, such as <hi rend="italic">Selections from the Papers ofthe Devil, or Recreations under the Cranium of α Giantess,</hi>  and the absurd devices by which he generally introduces his narration, as in the <hi rend="italic">Hesperus,</hi>  where a series of letters is represented as mysteriously conveyed to the author in letter-bags tied round the neck of a shock-dog, betray a mind anxious to astonish by fantastic conceits, and insensible to the beauty of simplicity. The constant recurrence of these instances of literary quackery, the want of connexion which his chaotic narrations exhibit, combined with the visionary cast of his views, justifying his own remark, that the empire of the Germans was peculiarly that of the air, has been fatal, and we think justly, to all attempts to naturalize Richter in this country. His pathos we think in the worst style of false, and often meaningless, effusions of sentimentality ; but as a quiet humourist, blending good feeling with his satire, he is often very successful. In this respect we admit the truth of the observations of Mr. Carlyle, from whose estimate of Richter’s genius we in other respects fundamentally differ : “ It is on the strength of this, and its accompanying endowments, that his main success as an artist depends. His favourite characters have always a dash of the ridiculous in their circumstances, in their composition, perhaps in both. They are often men of no account, vain, poor, ignorant, feeble ; and we scarcely know how it is that we love them ; for the author all along has been laughing no less heartily than we at their ineptitudes. Yet so it is; his Fibel, his Fixlein, his Siebenkâs, even his Schmelzle, insinuate themselves into our affections ; and their ultimate place is closer to our hearts than that of many more splendid heroes. This is tlle test of true humour ; no wit, no sarcasm, no knowledge, will suffice ; not talent, but genius, will accomplish the result.”</p><p>A strong contrast to these pictures of ordinary life, whether serious or comic, was presented by the mass of roman-</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
