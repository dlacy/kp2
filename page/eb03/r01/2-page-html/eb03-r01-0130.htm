<p><span class="font1">Newton has ſhown that the reſiſtance ariſing from this cauſe is conſtant, or the ſame in every velocity ; and&nbsp;when he has taken off a certain part of the total reſiſt-ance, he found the remainder was very exactly proportionable to the ſquare of the velocity. His experiments&nbsp;to this purpoſe were made with balls a very little heavier than water, ſo as to deſcend very flowly ; and they&nbsp;were made with his uſual care and accuracy, and may&nbsp;be depended on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font1">thc expcriments made with bodies floating on the ſurface of water, there is an addition to the reſiſtance&nbsp;ariſing from the inertia of the water. The water heaps&nbsp;up a little on the anterior ſurface of the floating body,&nbsp;and is depreffed behind it. Hence ariſes a hydroſtatical&nbsp;preffure, acting in concert with the true reſiſtance. A&nbsp;ſimilar thing is obſerved in the reſiſtance of air, which&nbsp;is condenſed before the body and rarefied behind it, and&nbsp;thus an additional refiſtance is produced by. the unbalanced elaſticity of the air ; and alſo becauſe the air,&nbsp;which is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">actually</span><span class="font1"> diſplaced, is denſer than common air.&nbsp;Theſe circumſtances cauſe the refiſtances to increaſe&nbsp;faſter than the ſquares of the velocities : but, even independent of this, there is an additional refiſtance arifing from the tendency to rarefaction behind a very&nbsp;ſwift body ; becaufe the preffure of the ſurrounding&nbsp;fluid can only make the ſiuid fill the ſpace left with a&nbsp;determined velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">we have had occaſion to ſpeak of this circumſtance more particularly under Gunnery and Pneumatics,&nbsp;when co.nſidering very rapid motions. Mr Robins had&nbsp;remarked that the velocity at which the obſerved reſiſtance of the air began to increaſe ſo prodigioufly, was&nbsp;that of about noo or 1200 feet per ſecond, and that&nbsp;this was the velocity with which air would-ruſh into a&nbsp;void. He concluded, that when the velocity was great-er than this, the ball was expofed to the additional re-fiſtance ariſing from the unbalanced ſtatical preffure of&nbsp;the air, and that this conſtant quantity behoved to be&nbsp;added to the reſiſtance ariſing from the air's inertia in&nbsp;all greater velocities. This is very reaſonable : But he&nbsp;imagined that in ſmaller velocities there was no ſuch&nbsp;unbalanced preffure. But this cannot be the caſe : for&nbsp;although in ſmaller velocities the air will ftill fill up the&nbsp;fpace behind the body, it will not fill it up .with air of&nbsp;the fâme denſity. This would be to ſuppoſe the motion of the air into the deſerted place to be inſtantane-ous. There muſt therefore be a rarefaction behind the&nbsp;body, and a preffure backward ; ariſing from unbalan-ced elafticity, independent of the condenſation on the&nbsp;anterior part. The condenſation and rarefaction are&nbsp;cauſed by the ſame thing, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">viz.</span><span class="font1"> the limited elafticity of&nbsp;the air. were this infinitely great, the ſmalleſt ∙conden-fation before the body would be inſtantly diffuſed over&nbsp;the whole air, and ſo would the rarefaction, ſo that no&nbsp;preffure of unbalanced elaſticity would be obſerved; but&nbsp;the elaſticity is fuch as to propagate the condenfation&nbsp;with the velocity of found only, z. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font1"> the velocity of&nbsp;1142 feet per ſecond. Therefore this additional re-ſiſtance does not commence preciſely at this velocity,&nbsp;but is ſenſible in all ſmaller velocities, as is very juſtly&nbsp;obſerved by Euler. But we are not yet able to aſcer-tain the law of its increaſe, although it is a problem&nbsp;which ſeems ſuſceptible </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">a tolerably accurate ſolu-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">tion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Preciſely fimilar to this is the reſiſtance to the mo-tion of floating bodies, ariſing from the accumulation or gorging up of the water on their anterior furface,&nbsp;and its depreſſion behind them, were the gravity of&nbsp;the water infinite, while its inertia remains the fame,&nbsp;the wave raiſed up at the prow of a ſhip would be inſtantly diſſuſed over the whole ocean, and it would&nbsp;therefore be infinitely ſmall, as alſo the depreſſion be-hind the poop. But this wave requires time for its&nbsp;diſſufion ; and while it is not diſſuſed, it acts byſhydrofe-tieal preſſure. AVe are equally unable to alcertain the&nbsp;law of variation of this part of the reſiſtance, the me-chaniſm of waves being but very imperfectly under-ſtood. The height of the wave in the experiments of&nbsp;the French academy could not be meaſured with ſuffi-cient preciſion (being only obſerved </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">en pafiant)</span><span class="font1"> tor afcertaining its relation to the velocity. The Chev. Buat&nbsp;attempted it in his experiments, butwithoutſucceſs. Thia&nbsp;muſt evidently make a part of the reſiſtance in all velo-cities : and it ſtill remains an undecided queſtion, &quot;what&nbsp;relation it bears to the velocities?” when the ſolid body is wholly buried in the ſiuid, this accumulation doea&nbsp;not take place, or at leaſt not in the ſame way : It</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">may, however, be obſerved. Every perſon may recol-lect, that in a very ſwift running ſtream a large ſtone at the bottom will produce a ſmall ſwell above it ; un-leſs it lies very deep, a nice eye may ſtill obſerve it.&nbsp;The water, on arriving at the obſtacle, glides paſt it in&nbsp;every direction, and is deflected on all hands; and therefore what paſſes over it is alſo deflected upwards, and&nbsp;cauſes the water over it to riſe above its level. The&nbsp;nearer that the body is to the ſurface, the greater will&nbsp;be the perpendicular riſe of the water, but it will be&nbsp;leſs diſſuſed; and it is uncertain whether the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">whole</span><span class="font1"> elevation will be greater or leſs. By the whole elevation&nbsp;we mean the area of a perpendicular ſection of the ele-vation by a plane perpendicular to the direction of the&nbsp;ſtream. we are rather diſpoſed to think that this area&nbsp;will be greateſt when the body is near the ſurface.&nbsp;D’Ulloa has attempted to conſider this ſubject ſcienti-fically ; and is of a very different opinion, which he&nbsp;confirms by the ſingle experiment to he mentioned by&nbsp;and by. Mean time, it is evident, that if the water&nbsp;which glides paſt the body cannot fall in behind it with&nbsp;ſuſſicient velocity for filling up the ſpace behind, there&nbsp;muſt be a void there ; and thus a hydroſtatical preſſure&nbsp;muſt be ſuperadded to the reſiſtance ariſing from the&nbsp;inertia of the water. All muſt have obſerved, that if&nbsp;the end of a ſtick held in the hand be drawn ſlowly&nbsp;through the water, the water will fill the place left by&nbsp;the ſtick, and there will be no curled wave : but .if the&nbsp;motion be very rapid, a hollow trough or gutter is left&nbsp;behind, and is not ſilled up till at ſome diſtance from&nbsp;the ſtick, and the wave which forms its fides is very&nbsp;much broken and curled. The writer of this article&nbsp;has often looked into the water from the poop of a&nbsp;ſecond rate man of war when ſhe was failing 11 miles&nbsp;per hour, which is a velocity of 16 feet per ſecond&nbsp;nearly ; and he not only obſerved that the back of the&nbsp;rudder was naked for about two feet below the load&nbsp;water-line, but alſo that the trough or wake made by the&nbsp;ſhip was filled up with water which was broken and&nbsp;foaming to a conſiderable depth, and to a confiderable&nbsp;diſtance from the veſſel: There muſt therefore have been</span></p>
