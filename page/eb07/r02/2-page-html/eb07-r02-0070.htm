<p><span class="font1">found to agree with the facts which the researches of so many active investigators of this curious subject have been&nbsp;able to ascertain. It is found, for example, and we will&nbsp;produce instances in viewing the progress of romance in particular countries, that the earliest productions of this sort,&nbsp;known to exist, are short narrations or ballads, which were&nbsp;probably sung on solemn or festive occasions, recording the&nbsp;deeds and praises of some famed champion of the tribe and&nbsp;country, or perhaps the history of some remarkable victory&nbsp;or signal defeat, calculated to interest the audience by the&nbsp;associations which the song awakens. These poems, of&nbsp;which very few can now be supposed to exist, are not without flashes of genius, but brief, rude, and often obscure,&nbsp;from real antiquity or affected sublimity of diction. The&nbsp;song on the battle of Brunanburgh, preserved in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Saxon&nbsp;Chronicle,</span><span class="font1"> is a genuine and curious example of this aboriginal style of poetry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even at tllis early period,@@<sup>1</sup> there may be observed a distinction betwixt what may be called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Temporal</span><span class="font1"> and ⅛</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1">t-</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ritual</span><span class="font1"> romances ; the first destined to the celebration of worldly glory ; the second to recording the deaths of martyrs and the miracles of saints; both which themes unquestionably met with an almost equally favourable reception&nbsp;from their hearers. But although most nations possess, in&nbsp;their early species of literature, specimens of both kinds of&nbsp;romance, the proportion of each, as was naturally to have&nbsp;been expected, differs according as the genius of the people&nbsp;amongst whom they occur leaned towards devotion or military enterprise. Thus, of the Saxon specimens of poetry,&nbsp;which manuscripts still afford us, a very large proportion is&nbsp;devotional, amongst which are several examples of the spiritual romance, but very few, indeed, of those respecting&nbsp;warfare or chivalry. On the other hand, the Norman language, though rich in examples of both kinds of romances,&nbsp;is particularly abundant in that which relates to battle and&nbsp;warlike adventure. The Christian Saxons had become&nbsp;comparatively pacific, while the Normans were certainly&nbsp;accounted the most martial people in Europe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However different the spiritual romance may be from the temporal in scope and tendency, the nature of the two&nbsp;compositions did not otherwise greatly differ. The structure of verse and style of composition was the same ; and&nbsp;the induction, even when the most serious subject was undertaken, exactly resembled that with which minstrels introduced their idle tales, and often contained allusions to&nbsp;them. Warton quotes a poem on the Passions, which&nbsp;begins,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">I hereth one lutele tale, that Ich eu wille telle,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As wi vyndeth hit invrite in the godspelle,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Nuz hit nouht of Carlemeyne ne of tbe Duzpere,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ac of Criste's thruurynge, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The temporal romances, on the other hand, often commenced by such invocations of the Deity, as would only have been in place when a much more solemn subject was&nbsp;to be agitated. The exordium of the Romance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ferum-bras</span><span class="font1"> may serve as an example of a custom almost universal ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">God in glorye of mightis moost That all things made in sapience,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">By virtue of Word and Holy Gooste,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Giving to men great excellence, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The distresses and dangers which the knight endured for the sake of obtaining earthly fame and his mistress’s favour,&nbsp;the saint or martyr was exposed to for the purpose of securing his rank in heaven, and the favour of some beloved and&nbsp;peculiar patron saint. If the earthly champion is in peril from&nbsp;monsters, dragons, and enchantments, the spiritual hero is&nbsp;represented as liable to the constant assaults of the whole&nbsp;invisible world, headed by the ancient dragon himself. If&nbsp;the knight is succoured at need by some favouring fairy or&nbsp;protecting genius, the saint is under the protection not only&nbsp;of the whole heavenly host, but of same one divine patron or&nbsp;patroness who is his especial auxiliary. Lastly, the conclusion of the romance, which usually assigns to the champion a fair realm, an abundant succession, and a train of&nbsp;happy years, consigns to the martyr his fane and altar upon&nbsp;earth, and in heaven his seat among saints and angels, and&nbsp;his share in a blessed eternity. It remains but to say, that&nbsp;the style and language of these two classes do not greatly&nbsp;differ, and that the composers of both employ the same&nbsp;structure of rhythm and of language, and draw their ideas&nbsp;and their incidents from similar sources ; so that, having&nbsp;noticed the existence of the spiritual romance, it is unnecessary for the present to prosecute this subject farther.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Another early and natural division of these works of fiction seems to have arranged them into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Serious</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Comical. </span><span class="font1">The former were by far the most numerous, and examples&nbsp;of the latter are in most countries comparatively rare. Such&nbsp;a class, however, existed, as proper romances, even if we&nbsp;hold the comic romance distinct from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Contes</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fabliaux</span><span class="font1"> of the French, and from such jocular English narratives as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wife Lαpt in Morals Skin, The Friar and the&nbsp;Boy,</span><span class="font1"> and similar humorous tales ; of which the reader will&nbsp;find many examples in Ritson’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ancient English Poetry,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and in other collections. The scene of these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gestes</span><span class="font1"> being&nbsp;laid in low, or at least in ordinary life, they approach in their&nbsp;nature more nearly to the class of novels, and may perhaps&nbsp;be considered as the earliest specimens of tllat kind of composition. But the proper comic romance was that in which&nbsp;the high terms and knightly adventures of chivalry were burlesqued, by ascribing them to clowns or others of a low and&nbsp;mean degree. Such compositions formed, as it were, a parody on&nbsp;the serious romance, to which they bore the same proportion as&nbsp;the antimasque, studiously filled with grotesque, absurd, and&nbsp;extravagant characters, “ entering,” as the stage direction&nbsp;usually informs us, “ to a confused music,” bore to the masque itself, where all was dignified, noble, stately, and harmonious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An excellent example of the comic romance is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tournament of Tottenham,</span><span class="font1"> printed in Piercy<sup>,</sup>s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reliques,</span><span class="font1"> in which a number of clowns are introduced practising one of these&nbsp;warlike games, which were the exclusive prerogative of the&nbsp;warlike and noble. They are represented making vows to&nbsp;the swan, the peacock, and the ladies ; riding a tilt on their&nbsp;clumsy cart horses,and encountering each other withplough-shares and flails; whilst their defensive armour consisted of&nbsp;great wooden bowls and troughs, by way of helmets and&nbsp;cuirasses. The learned editor seems to have thought this&nbsp;singular composition was like Don Quixote, with which he&nbsp;compares it, a premeditated effort of satire, written to expose the grave and fantastic manners of the serious romance.&nbsp;This is considering the matter too deeply, and ascribing to&nbsp;the author a more critical purpose than he was probably capable of conceiving. It is more natural to suppose that his&nbsp;only ambition was to raise a laugh, by ascribing to the vulgar the manners and exercises of the noble and valiant ; as&nbsp;in the well-known farce of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">High Life Below Stairs,</span><span class="font1"> the ridicule is not directed against the manners described, but&nbsp;against the menials who affect those that are only befitting&nbsp;their superiors. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hunting of the Hare,</span><span class="font1"> published in the&nbsp;collection formed by the late industrious and accurate Mr.&nbsp;Weber, is a comic romance of the same order. A yeoman&nbsp;informs the inhabitants of a country hamlet that he has found&nbsp;a hare sitting, and invites them to come to course her. They&nbsp;attend, accordingly, with all the curs and mastiffs of their&nbsp;village, and the unsportsman-like manner in which the inexperienced huntsmen and their irregular pack conduct&nbsp;themselves, forms the interest of the piece. It can hardly&nbsp;be supposed the satire is directed against the sport of hunt-</span></p><div>
