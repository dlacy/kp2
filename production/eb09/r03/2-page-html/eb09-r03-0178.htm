<p><span class="font2">ROSSELLINO, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bernardo</span><span class="font2"> (1409-1464), was no less able as a sculptor than his younger brother (see above), and&nbsp;was also a very distinguished architect. His finest piece&nbsp;of sculpture is the tomb, in the Florentine Santa Croce, of&nbsp;Leonardo Bruni of Arezzo, the historian of Florence ; the&nbsp;recumbent effigy is a work of great merit. The inner&nbsp;cathedral pulpit at Prato, circular in form on a tall slender&nbsp;stem, was partly the work of Mino da Fiesole and partly&nbsp;by Bernardo Rossellino. The latter executed the very&nbsp;minute reliefs of St Stephen and the Assumption of the&nbsp;Virgin. For his part in the work he received sixty-six gold&nbsp;florins. The South Kensington Museum possesses a relief&nbsp;by Bernardo, signed and dated (1456). It is a fine portrait of the physician Giovanni da S. Miniato.@@<sup>1</sup> Bernardo’s&nbsp;works as an architect were very numerous and important,&nbsp;and he was also very skilful as a military engineer. He&nbsp;restored the church of S. Francis at Assisi, and designed&nbsp;several fine buildings at Civita Vecchia, Orvieto, and&nbsp;elsewhere. He also built fortresses and city walls at&nbsp;Spoleto, Orvieto, and Civita Castellana. He was largely&nbsp;employed by Nicholas V. and Pius II. for restorations in&nbsp;nearly all the great basilicas of Rome, but at present little&nbsp;trace of his work remains, owing to the sweeping alterations which were made during the tasteless 17th and 18th&nbsp;centuries. Between the years 1461 and 1464 (the date of&nbsp;his death) he occupied the important post of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">capo-maestro&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">to the Florentine duomo. A number of buildings at&nbsp;Pienza, executed for Pius II., are attributed to him ; the&nbsp;Vatican registers mention the architect of these as M<sup>0&nbsp;</sup>Bernardo di Fiorenza, but this indication is too slight to&nbsp;make it certain that the elder Rossellino is referred to&nbsp;(see Vasari, ed. Milanesi, iii. 93 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sq.</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∖</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSSETTI, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dante Gabriel</span><span class="font2"> (1828-1882), poet and painter, whose full baptismal name was Gabriel Charles&nbsp;Dante, was born May 12, 1828, at 38 Charlotte Street,&nbsp;Portland Place, London. He was the first of the two sons&nbsp;and the second of the four children of Gabriele Rossetti,&nbsp;the Italian poet and patriot, whose career was at one period&nbsp;as turbulent as that of his illustrious son was (as far as&nbsp;mere outward incidents went) uneventful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">About 1824 Gabriele Rossetti, the father, after many vicissitudes, reached England, where he married in 1826&nbsp;Frances Polidori, sister of Byron’s Dr Polidori and daughter&nbsp;of a Tuscan who had in early youth been AlfierPs secretary&nbsp;and who had married an English lady. From his mother&nbsp;the subject of this notice inherited as many English&nbsp;traits as Italian, or indeed more. In 1831 Gabriele&nbsp;became professor of Italian in King’s College, London,&nbsp;and afterwards achieved a recognized position as a subtle&nbsp;and original, if eccentric, commentator on Dante.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Dante Rossetti’s education was begun at a private school in Foley Street, Portland Place, where he remained,&nbsp;however, only nine months, from the autumn of 1835 to&nbsp;the summer of 1836. He next went (in the autumn of&nbsp;1836) to King’s College School, where he remained till&nbsp;the summer of 1843, having reached the fourth class.&nbsp;From early childhood he had displayed a marked propensity for drawing and painting. It had therefore from&nbsp;the first been tacitly assumed that his future career&nbsp;would be an artistic one, and he left school early. In&nbsp;Latin, however, he was already fairly proficient for his&nbsp;age ; French he knew well ; Italian he had spoken from&nbsp;childhood, and he had some German lessons about&nbsp;1844-45. But, although he learned enough German to&nbsp;be able to translate the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Arme Heinrich</span><span class="font2"> of Hartmann von</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> See Perkins, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Italian Sculptors,</span><span class="font1"> 1864, i. p. 207 ; also Id., </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tuscan Sculptors,</span><span class="font1"> p. 202, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Historical Handbook of Italian Sculpture,</span><span class="font1"> 1883,&nbsp;p. 121.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Aue, and some portions of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nibelungenlied,</span><span class="font2"> he afterwards forgot the language almost entirely. His Greek too, such as it had been, he lost. On leaving school he&nbsp;went to Cary’s Art Academy (previously called »Sass’s),&nbsp;near Bedford Square, and thence obtained admission to&nbsp;the Royal Academy Antique School towards 1846. He&nbsp;did not attend the Royal Academy Life School, and&nbsp;no doubt his defective knowledge of anatomy was some&nbsp;obstacle to him in after life. The truth is, however, that&nbsp;Rossetti’s occasionally defective drawing (which, as regards&nbsp;the throat, is most striking) did not arise mainly from&nbsp;ignorance ; it was the result of a peculiar mannerism.&nbsp;Admiring long and slender necks, and drawing them&nbsp;admirably in such masterpieces as Beata Beatrix and&nbsp;Monna Vanna, he refused to see that in art as in ethics&nbsp;the point of virtue lies midway between two opposite&nbsp;vices. Admiring large hands and massive arms in a&nbsp;woman, and drawing them admirably in such designs as&nbsp;Proserpine, Reverie, &amp;c., he refused to see that hands can&nbsp;be too large, arms too massive. As a colourist, however,&nbsp;Rossetti may be said to have required no teaching.&nbsp;Mastery over colour seemed to have come to him by instinct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Of the artistic education of foreign travel Rossetti had very little. But in early life he made a short tour in&nbsp;Belgium, where he was indubitably much impressed and&nbsp;influenced by the works of Van Eyck at Ghent and&nbsp;Memling at Bruges. In the spring of 1848 he took an&nbsp;active part in forming the so-called pre-Raphaelite brotherhood, the members of which believed that the time had&nbsp;come for the artist to confront again Nature herself—&nbsp;imitating no longer man’s imitations of her—even though&nbsp;the imitations be those splendid works of the great&nbsp;Raphaelite or post-Raphaelite masters which had hitherto&nbsp;been the inspiration of modern art. The revolution was&nbsp;to be one of motives no less than of methods. Of motive&nbsp;Rossetti was from the first a master. His struggle with&nbsp;methods we have already indicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To “ paint nature as it is around them, with the help of modern science,” was the object of the pre-Raphaelites&nbsp;according to Mr Ruskin, but to do so artists require&nbsp;something more than that “ earnestness of the men of the&nbsp;13th and 14th centuries” which Mr Ruskin speaks of:&nbsp;they require knowledge. Without knowledge, as we see&nbsp;in even such a marvellous design as Christ at the Door of&nbsp;Simon the Pharisee (1859), the artistic camel has to be&nbsp;drawn from the artist’s inner consciousness, and the result&nbsp;is rarely a satisfactory quadruped. Intensity of seeing does&nbsp;not necessarily imply truth of seeing ; otherwise what phenomenon can be more real than Blake’s Ghost of a Flea Î</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But Rossetti’s genius absorbed from pre-Raphaelitism all that it had to give, and then passed on its way towards its&nbsp;own special goal. Often and indeed mostly an artist’s&nbsp;true and best education is unlearning rather than learning.&nbsp;It was so in Rossetti’s case, though he had the most vivid&nbsp;personality and the rarest imagination of any man of his&nbsp;time. Plastic as molten wax, the mind from the dawn of&nbsp;consciousness begins learning, for good or ill. Youth,&nbsp;therefore, how rich soever in individual force, can no more&nbsp;help being imitative than a river, even though it be the&nbsp;Amazon itself, can help reflecting the scenery through&nbsp;which it flows. The goal before the young Rossetti’s eyes&nbsp;(as we see in such designs as Taurello’s First Sight of&nbsp;Fortune, 1848, and Cassandra) was to reach through art&nbsp;the forgotten world of old romance—that world of wonder&nbsp;and mystery and spiritual beauty which the old masters&nbsp;knew and could have painted had not lack of science,&nbsp;combined with slavery to monkish traditions of asceticism,&nbsp;crippled their strength. And he reached it—he reached&nbsp;early that world which not all the pseudo-classicism that&nbsp;arose in the 15th century, ripened in the 16th, and rotted</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
