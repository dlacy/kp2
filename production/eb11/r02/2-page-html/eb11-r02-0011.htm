<p><span class="font3">is very fertile, and excellent wine is produced in sufficient quantity for exportation. The Benedictine abbey of Reichenau,&nbsp;founded in 724, was long celebrated for its wealth and for the&nbsp;services rendered by its monks to the cause of learning. In&nbsp;1540 the abbey, which had previously been independent, was&nbsp;annexed to the see of Constance, and in 1799 it was secularized.&nbsp;The abbey church, dating in part from the 9th century, contains&nbsp;the tomb of Charles the Fat (d. 888), who retired to this island&nbsp;in 887, after losing the empire of Charlemagne. It now&nbsp;serves as the parish church of MittelzeII, while the churches of&nbsp;Oberzell and Unterzell are also interesting buildings of the&nbsp;Carolingian era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REICHENBACH, GEORG VON (1772-1826), German astronomical instrument maker, was bom at Durlach in Baden on the 24th of August 1772. From 1796 he was occupied with&nbsp;the construction of a dividing engine; in 1804, with Joseph,&nbsp;Liebherr and Joseph Utzschneider, he founded an instrumentmaking business in Munich; and in 1809 he estabIished, with&nbsp;Joseph Fraunhofer and Utzschneider, optical works at Benedictbeuern, which were moved to Munich in 1823. He withdrew&nbsp;from both enterprises in 1814, and founded with T. L. Ertel a&nbsp;new optical business, from which also he retired in 1821, on&nbsp;obtaining an engineering appointment under the Bavarian&nbsp;government. He died at Munich on the 21st of May 1826.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reichenbach's principal merit was that he introduced into observatories the. meridian or transit circle, combining the transit instrument and the mural circle into one instrument. This had already been done by O. Römer about 1704, but the idea had not&nbsp;been adopted by any one else, except in the transit circle constructed&nbsp;by Edward Troughton for Stephen Groombridge in 1806. The&nbsp;transit circle in the form given it by Reichenbach had one finely&nbsp;divided circle attached to one end of the horizontal axis and read&nbsp;by four verniers on an “ alidade circle,” the unaltered position of&nbsp;which was tested by a spirit level. The instrument came almost at&nbsp;once into universal use on the continent of Europe (the first one was&nbsp;made for F. W. Bessel in 1819), but in England the mural circle and&nbsp;transit instrument were not superseded for many years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REICHENBACH, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Silesia, situated on the Peile, at the foot of the&nbsp;Eulengebirge, a spur of the Riesengebirge, 30 m. S.W. of Breslau&nbsp;by rail. Pop. (1905) 15,984. Amongits industriesareweaving,&nbsp;spinning, dyeing, brewing and machine building, and there is a&nbsp;considerable trade in grain and cattle. Reichenbach is memorable for the victory gained here on the 16th of August 1762 by&nbsp;the Prussians over the Austrians. Here was held the congress&nbsp;which resulted in the convention of Reichenbach—signed on the&nbsp;27th of July 1790 between Great Britain, Prussia, Austria,&nbsp;Poland and Holland—guaranteeing the integrity of Turkey.&nbsp;Here, too, in June 1813, was signed the treaty of alliance between&nbsp;Austria and the Allies for the prosecution of the war against&nbsp;France.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">REICHENBACH, a town in the kingdom of Saxony, situated in a hilly district, known as the Vogtland, 11 m. S.W. of Zwickau,&nbsp;at the junction of the main Iines of railway Dresden-Leipzig-Hof.&nbsp;Pop. (1905) 24,915. It contains a handsome town-halI rebuilt&nbsp;in 1833, and a natural history museum. The industries embrace&nbsp;the manufacture of cloth, machinery and carriages, also dyeing&nbsp;and bleaching. The earliest mention of the town occurs in a&nbsp;document of 1212, and it acquired municipal rights in 1367.&nbsp;The woollen manufacture was introduced in the 15th century,&nbsp;and took the place of the mining industry which had been&nbsp;established earlier.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REICHENBERG (Czech, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Liberec),</span><span class="font3"> a town of Bohemia, 87 m. N.E. of Prague by rail. Pop. (1900) 34,099, chiefly&nbsp;German. The most prominent buildings are the new town-hall&nbsp;(1893); the castle of Count Clam Gallas, built in the 17th&nbsp;century, with additions dating from 1774 and 1850; the&nbsp;Erzdekanatskirche, of the 16th century; the Protestant church,&nbsp;a handsome modern Romanesque edifice (1864-68) and the hall&nbsp;of the cloth-workers. Reichenberg is one of the most important&nbsp;centres of trade and industry in Bohemia, its staple industry&nbsp;being the cloth manufacture. Next in importance comes the&nbsp;spinning and weaving of wool, cotton, linen and carpet manufactures, and dyeing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Reichenberg is first mentioned in a document of 1348, and from 1622 to 1634 was among the possessions of the great Wallenstein,&nbsp;since whose death it has belonged to the Gallas and CIam Gallas&nbsp;families, though their jurisdiction over the town has long ceased.&nbsp;The cloth-making industry was introduced in 1579.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">REICHENHALL, a town and watering-place in the kingdom of Bavaria, finely situated in an amphitheatre of lofty mountains, on the river Saalach, 1570 ft. above sea-level, 9 m. S.W.&nbsp;of Salzburg. Pop. (1900) 4927, excluding visitors. Reichenhall possesses several copious saline springs, producing about&nbsp;8500 tons of salt per annum. The water of some of the. springs,&nbsp;the sources of which are 50 ft. below the surface, is so strongly&nbsp;saturated with salt (up to 24%) that it is at once conducted&nbsp;to the boiling houses, while that of the others is first submitted&nbsp;to a process of evaporation. Reichenhall is the centre of the&nbsp;four chief Bavarian salt-works, which are connected with each&nbsp;other by brine conduits having an aggregate length of 60 m.&nbsp;The surplus brine of Berchtesgaden is conducted to Reichenhall, and thence, in increased volume, to Traunstein and Rosenheim, which possess larger supplies of timber for use as fuel&nbsp;in the process of boiling. Since 1846 Reichenhall has become&nbsp;one of the most fashionable spas and climatic health resorts&nbsp;in Germany, and it is now visited annually by about ten&nbsp;thousand patients, besides many thousand passing tourists.&nbsp;The saline springs are used both for drinking and bathing,&nbsp;and are said to be efficacious in scrofula and incipient tuberculosis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The brine springs of Reichenhall are mentioned in a document of the 8th century and were perhaps known to the Romans; but almost all trace of antiquity of the town was destroyed&nbsp;by a conflagration in 1834. The brine conduit to Traunstein&nbsp;dates from 1618. The environs abound in numerous charming&nbsp;Alpine excursions.</span></p>
