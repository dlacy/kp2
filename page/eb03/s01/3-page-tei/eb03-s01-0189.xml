The ſlaughter of the infantry and of the men at arms was very great; the moſt probable accounts make it 2000 men at arms, and upwards of 13,000 common ſoldiers. The loſs of the Engliſh was inconſiderable.</p><p>The day after this victory, Baliol took poſſeſſion of Perth; and, apprehending an attack from the earl of March, cauſed the ditch to be cleared, and the town to be fortified with palliſadoes. The firſt information which the earl received of this dreadful defeat was from a common ſoldier, who fled from the place mortally wounded. When this poor wretch came up, he had time to do no more than to ſhow his wounds; after which he fell down, and expired. On his arrival at the field of battle, he found a dreadful confirmation of the intelligence given by the ſoldier; but inſtead of taking his meaſures with any prudence, he and his men hurried on headlong to Perth, actuated only by a blind impulfe to revenge. At firſt they deſigned to aſſault the place; but their hearts failing them, they next determined to reduce it by famine. This, however, could not be done unleſs the Scots were maſters at ſea. One John Crab, a Flemiſh engineer (who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf by deſtroying the famous engine called the <hi rend="italic">ſow</hi> at the ſiege of Berwick), had continued for many years to annoy the Engliſh on the eaſtern coaſts. After the blockade of Perth was formed, he came with ten veſſels to the mouth of the Tay, where the Engliſh fleet was, and took the ſhip belonging to Henry de Beaumont; but ſoon after all his ten veſſels were burnt by the Engliſh in a general engagement. After this the blockade of Perth was raiſed, the earl of March diſhanded his army, and Edward Baliol was crowned king of Scotland at Scone, on the 24th of September 1332.</p><p>The new monarch was no ſooner put in poſſeſſion of the kingdom, than he left Perth in the hands ot the earl of Fife, while he himſelf repaired to the ſouthern parts of the kingdom. But the party of king David was far from being extinguiſhed. Baliol was ſcarce gone, when the town of Perth was ſurpriſed, and its fortifications razed, by James Fraſer, Simon Fraſer, and Robert Keith. The earl of Fife was made priſoner, with his family and vaſſals. Andrew Murray of Tullibardine, who had directed the Engliſh to a ford on the river Earn, was put to death as a traitor. Such of the Scots as ſtill adhered to the intereſt of their infant prince, choſe Sir Andrew Murray of Bothwell regent. He was a brave and active man, but had not as yet ſufficient force to attempt any thing conſiderable.</p><p>In the mean time, Baliol behaved in a moſt ſcandalous manner. At Roxburgh, he made a ſolemn ſurrender of the liberties of Scotland; acknowledged Edward for his liege-lord; and, as if this had not been ſufficient, he became bound to put him in poſſeſſion of the town, caſtle, and territory of Berwick, and of other lands on the marches, extending in all to the yearly value of 2000 l. “on account,” as the infiniment bears, “of the great honour and emoluments which we have procured through the <hi rend="italic">ſuffrance</hi> of our lord the king, and by the powerful and acceptable aid which we have received from his good ſubjects.” He alſo proffered to marry the princeſs Johanna, whom he considered as only betrothed to David Bruce, and to add 500 l. to</p><p>her jointure; and this under the penalty of 10,000 l. to be appropriated as a portion to the young lady, or otherwiſe diſpoſed of for her behoof. He further engaged to provide for the maintenance of David Bruce as the king of England ſhould adviſe; and, laſtly, he became bound to ſerve Edward in all his wars, excepting in England, Wales, and Ireland, for the ſpace of a year together, with 200 men at arms, and all at his own charges; and he bound his ſuccessors to perform the like ſervice with 100 men at arms. But afterwards Edward having engaged to maintain him on the throne of Scotland, Baliol bound himſelf to ſerve him in all his wars whatever.</p><p>Though the greateſt part of the nation ſubmitted to this ſhameful treaty, it rouſed the indignation of thoſe who wiſhed well to the liberties of their country. John, the ſecond ſon of Randolph, now earl of Moray by the death of his brother; Archibald, the youngeſt brother of the renowned Douglas; together with Simon Fraſer, aſſembled a body of horſemen at Moffat in Annandale; and, ſuddenly traverſing the country, aſſaulted Baliol unexpectedly at Annan. His brother Henry made a gallant reſiſtance for ſome time but was at laſt overpowered with numbers, and killed, together with ſeveral other perſons of diſtinction. Baliol himſelf eſcaped almoſt naked, with ſcarce a Angle attendant, and fled to England. After his departure, the Scots began to make depredations on the Engliſh frontiers. Edward iſſued a proclamation, in which he ſolemnly averred, that the Scots, by their hoſtile depredations, had violated the peace of Northampton. Baliol, in the mean time, being joined by ſome Engliſh barons, returned to Scotland; took and burnt a caſtle where Robert de Colville commanded; and, eſtabliſhing his quarters in the neighbourhood of Roxburgh, began to make preparations for beſieging Berwick. Juſt after his arrival, Archibald Douglas, with 3000 men, invaded England by the weſtern marches, plundered the country, and carried off much booty; in revenge for which, Sir Anthony de Lucy made an inroad into Scotland, defeated and took priſoner Sir William Douglas, celebrated in hiſtory by the appellation of <hi rend="italic">the knight of Liddeſdale,</hi> whom Edward cauſed to be put in irons. About the ſame time, Sir Andrew Murray the regent attacked Baliol, with a view to diſcomfit him before the reinforcements which he expected out of England could arrive. A ſharp conflict enſued at Roxburgh, in which the regent, attempting to reſcue a ſoldier, was taken priſoner: and thus Scotland was at once deprived of its two ableſt commanders.</p><p>Archibald Douglas was now declared regent; and Edward prepared to invade Scotland, in order to take vengeance on its inhabitants, as he ſaid, for the wrongs they had done, and to ſeek ſuch redreſs as might ſeem good to himſelf. He ordered poſſeſſion to be taken of the isle of Man in his own name; and ſoon after made it over to Sir William de Montague, who had' ſome claim of inheritance in it. The chief deſign of Edward in this expedition, however, was to obtain poſſeſſion of the town of Berwick, which had been already ceded to him by Baliol. This appeared to the Scots a place of no leſs importance than it did to Edward; and therefore they took all the precautions in their power to prevent the loſs of it. The earl of March was appointed to command the caſtle, and Sir.</p></body></text></TEI>
