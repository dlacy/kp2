<p><span class="font1">viving Mesosuchian Crocodiles of the Jurassic period Gavial-like forms existed, and genera with posterior choanæ&nbsp;and procœlous vertebræ (Eusuchians),—among them a&nbsp;true Crocodile from the Cambridge Upper Greensand.&nbsp;The western hemisphere exceeded the eastern as regards&nbsp;the abundance of Dinosaurians in this period still more&nbsp;than in the preceding, although it should be remembered&nbsp;that of the latter part of the globe in fact only a small&nbsp;portion has been opened up, and that the little we know&nbsp;of the geology of Central Asia and western China points&nbsp;to the probability of vast palæontological treasures being&nbsp;reserved for the study of future generations. Rhynchoce-phalian genera continue in considerable variety, whilst&nbsp;other small-sized forms are referred to the Lacertilians.&nbsp;The types of Freshwater Turtles which lived in the&nbsp;Jurassic period pass into the Cretaceous. They appear&nbsp;now also in North-American strata : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelydifilæ</span><span class="font1"> first, accompanied or immediately followed by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ernydidx,</span><span class="font1"> a few&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trionyx</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelonia,</span><span class="font1"> and the remarkable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Protostega,</span><span class="font1"> a&nbsp;precursor of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphargis.</span><span class="font1"> Towards the end of the Cretaceous&nbsp;period its abundant Reptilian life is swept away, and not&nbsp;only every species but almost every Mesozoic genus disappears, a wide gap being left in our knowledge of the&nbsp;succession of Reptilian life between this period and the&nbsp;Tertiary era.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the lowermost strata of Tertiary age a few isolated remains remind us still of the extinct Mesozoic fauna ; such&nbsp;are one or two genera allied to the Dinosaurians </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Agathαu-rnas)</span><span class="font1"> from the Laramie beds of North America. In other&nbsp;respects the Tertiary Reptiles bear already the character&nbsp;of the present fauna ; although families or genera which&nbsp;are distinct from the living predominate in the Eocene,&nbsp;from the Miocene Reptiles gradually approach more and&nbsp;more the specific forms of our time. True Crocodiles&nbsp;(of which one species occurred already in the Cretaceous&nbsp;period), Gavials, Alligators have now entirely superseded&nbsp;the “ Mesosuchian ” type. The remains of Lacertilians&nbsp;are fragmentary and generally indistinct, so as to offer a&nbsp;wide field for generic distinctions. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anguidæ</span><span class="font1"> have been&nbsp;distinctly traced back to the Miocene of North America.&nbsp;With a single exception, that of a poisonous Serpent,&nbsp;apparently a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vipera,</span><span class="font1"> the remains of which have been&nbsp;found in Miocene deposits at Sansan (south of France),&nbsp;Snakes do not appear before the Eocene, in England as well&nbsp;as North America ; they are mostly large species, with uncertain affinities, but all innocuous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Palævphis, Dinophis,&nbsp;Boctcus, Lithσphis).</span><span class="font1"> Their remains are scarce, and even&nbsp;those of the later Tertiary formations show a greater&nbsp;resemblance to genera which are now-a-days locally far&nbsp;removed than to those living in the same geographical&nbsp;district. Chelonian remains are numerous throughout,&nbsp;probably on account of the resistance which their solid&nbsp;carapaces offered to destructive agencies. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chelydidæ,&nbsp;Emydddæ,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trwnycidæ</span><span class="font1"> and also Marine Turtles continue to exist in an almost uninterrupted series, and&nbsp;approach so much the modern genera that, for instance, in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trwnyχ,</span><span class="font1"> if specific distinctions existed between Miocene&nbsp;and recent species, they cannot be determined in those&nbsp;parts of their skeleton which have been preserved. A&nbsp;peculiar type intermediate between the Marine Turtles and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Emys</span><span class="font1"> existed in the English Eocene </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Chelone).</span><span class="font1"> Land&nbsp;Tortoises, the most specialized type of the order, probably&nbsp;did not appear before the Miocene. A number of smaller&nbsp;forms are referable to the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Testudo,</span><span class="font1"> but gigantic&nbsp;forms existed then as now in isolated localities, and&nbsp;exceeded in size the living, like the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Colossoehelys</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;Siwalik Hills, with a carapace computed to be 20 feet&nbsp;long, and the smaller </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Macrochelys</span><span class="font1"> from the German&nbsp;Molasse. It is extremely singular that the existence of&nbsp;these colossal Chelonians would seem to coincide with the&nbsp;period of the first appearance of the type of Land Tortoises.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of the first appearance of most of the families of the recent fauna, and of their distribution in the Quaternary&nbsp;period,<sup>1</sup> we know next to nothing. With few exceptions&nbsp;the Reptilian type had dwindled to forms of such small&nbsp;size that their remains, if preserved, escape observation or&nbsp;are too indistinct for determination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The Distribution of Existing Reptiles over the Earth’s Surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Serious obstacles present themselves at the present time to a satisfactory treatment of the geographical distribution&nbsp;of Reptiles. We have mentioned at the end of the&nbsp;preceding section that the geological record is much too&nbsp;incomplete to permit a comparison to be drawn between&nbsp;their distribution in the present and next preceding&nbsp;periods, and that we are therefore ignorant as to the&nbsp;modes in which their dispersal was brought about, and&nbsp;unable to account otherwise than hypothetically for the&nbsp;numerous instances of apparently anomalous distribution.&nbsp;And, when we limit ourselves merely to the task of describing the facts of their distribution at the present day, it is&nbsp;necessary for such an attempt that the whole class should&nbsp;have previously undergone a thorough rearrangement in&nbsp;accordance with the present state of science, and that the&nbsp;scattered contributions to the various faunæ should have&nbsp;been critically examined and treated by the same uniform&nbsp;method. This is unfortunately not the case with the class&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reptilia.</span><span class="font1"> The systems and lists of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lαcertiliα</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ophidia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which formed the bases for the treatises on the geographical distribution of these orders by Schlegel, Günther, and&nbsp;Wallace are buried under an accumulation of an immense&nbsp;number of additions of very different value, which require&nbsp;a uniform critical revision before they can be used in an&nbsp;inquiry of a general biological scope.<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the following notes we have been able to include the majority of the genera of Chelonians and Ophidians, with an approximate&nbsp;estimate of the species of each that are known at present. As&nbsp;regards the former Strauch<sup>3</sup> has done much to clear the way,&nbsp;although the small amount of materials known to him from&nbsp;autopsy interfered much with his critical judgment. Not many&nbsp;additions have been made to this order since the time of the&nbsp;publication of his memoirs. Of the numerous Ophidian genera&nbsp;and species we have eliminated all which are based on trivial&nbsp;distinctions, or are named by authors without special acquaintance&nbsp;with the subject. We have not entered into a full consideration&nbsp;of Lacertilian genera, as this would have been useless at a time&nbsp;when they are undergoing a revision, but have restricted ourselves&nbsp;to the families recently proposed by Boulenger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">One of the most important results obtained by this inquiry is that the same arrangement of the so-called&nbsp;primary zoological regions is not applicable to all orders&nbsp;of Reptiles, and that the differences in their distribution&nbsp;are so fundamental that they can be accounted for only&nbsp;on the assumption of the various orders and families&nbsp;having appeared and spread over the globe at very distant&nbsp;periods, when land and water were differently distributed&nbsp;over the surface of the globe. At the end of this section&nbsp;we shall show in a short résumé the mutual relations&nbsp;between the various regions with respect to the several&nbsp;orders of Reptiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The means of dispersal of Reptiles are very limited.</span></p>
