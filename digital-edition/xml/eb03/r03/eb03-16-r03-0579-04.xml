a large village in Holland, ſeated between the Hague and Delft, where the prince of O-range has a palace, which ſtands about a quarter of a mile farther. It is a very noble ſtructure, all of hewn ſtone, of great extent in front, but perhaps not propor-tionably high. It is adorned with a marble ltair-caſe, marble floors, and a magnificent terrace. There is a good proſpect of it from the canal between Delft and the Hague. This place is remarkable for a treaty concluded here in 1697 between England, Germany, Holland, France, and Spain. E. Long. 4. 20. N. Lat <hi rend="sub">0</hi> 52. 8.</p>
