Eleven points constitute a game.&nbsp;Ring-goal was invented by an under-graduate of Keble College,&nbsp;Oxford, about 1885, and was played at Oxford, but without&nbsp;attracting any wide popularity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RINGWOOD, a market town in the New Forest parliamentary division of Hampshire, England, 103I m. S.W. by W. from&nbsp;London by the London &amp; South-Western railway. Pop.&nbsp;(1901) 4629. It lies pleasantly on the river Avon, which&nbsp;here divides into numerous branches, flowing through flat&nbsp;meadow land. The church of SS. Peter and Paul, which&nbsp;was almost entirely reconstructed in 1854, the town hall and&nbsp;com exchange are the chief buildings. A large agricultural&nbsp;trade and manufactures of agricultural implements, linen&nbsp;goods and woollen gloves are carried on.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RINGWORM (or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Tinea Tonsukans),</span><span class="font1"> a disease of the scalp (especially common within the tropics); it consists of bald&nbsp;patches, usually round, and varying in diameter from half&nbsp;an inch up to several inches, the surface showing the broken&nbsp;stumps of hairs and a fine whitish powdering of desquamated&nbsp;epidermic scales. In scrofulous subjects matter is sometimes&nbsp;produced, which forms crusts, or glues the hair together, or&nbsp;otherwise obscures the characteristic appearance. The disease&nbsp;is due to a parasite, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trichophyton tonsurans,</span><span class="font1"> which exists&nbsp;mostly in the form of innumerable spores (with hardly any&nbsp;mycelium), and is most abundant within the substance of the&nbsp;hairs, especially at their roots. If a piece of the hair near&nbsp;the root be soaked for a time in dilute liquor potassae and&nbsp;pressed flat under a cover-glass, the microscope will show it&nbsp;to be occupied by long rows of minute oval spores, very uniform&nbsp;in size, and each bearing a nucleus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The same fungus sometimes attacks the hairs of the beard, producing a disease called “ sycosis.” Sometimes it invades&nbsp;the hairless regions of skin, forming “ tinea circinata ”;&nbsp;circular patches of skin disease, if they be sharply defined by a&nbsp;margin of papules or vesicles, may be suspected of depending&nbsp;on the tinea-fungus. Interesting varieties of tinea are found&nbsp;in some of the Pacific and East Indian islands. Among the&nbsp;best remedial agents are various mercurial preparations. But&nbsp;in modern practice much success has been found in X-raying&nbsp;the patch in order to remove the dead and diseased hairs, thus&nbsp;leaving a free channel for the passage of antiseptic applications&nbsp;to the follicles. The exposures are followed by inunction of a&nbsp;mercurial preparation or of a lotion of tincture of iodine with&nbsp;methylated spirit.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RINTOUL, ROBERT STEPHEN (1787-1858), British journalist, was born at Tibbermore, Perthshire, in 1787, and&nbsp;educated at the Aberdalgie parish school.

<p><span class="font1">RINUCCINI, GIOVANNI BATTISTA (1592-1653), archbishop ofFermo, was born in Rome on the 15th of September 1592,&nbsp;being the son of a senator. He studied at several Italian&nbsp;universities, became chamberlain to Pope Gregory XV., and in&nbsp;1625 was made archbishop of Fermo. His participation in&nbsp;Irish politics, which is his chief title to fame, began during the&nbsp;later stages of the Civil War when Ireland was the scene of&nbsp;universal disorder. In 1645 Pope Innocent X. despatched him&nbsp;to that country as papal nuncio; he landed at Kenmare with&nbsp;arms and money in October 1645, and took up his residence at&nbsp;Kilkenny. Before this time the Roman Catholics had banded&nbsp;themselves together for defence. Called the Confederate&nbsp;Catholics, they had set up a provisional government, and when&nbsp;the nuncio reached Kilkenny they were engaged in negotiating&nbsp;for peace with the lord lieutenant, the marquess, afterwards&nbsp;duke, of Ormonde. Rinuccini took part in the proceedings,&nbsp;but as his demands were ignored he refused to recognize the&nbsp;peace which was concluded in March 1646, and gaining the&nbsp;support of the Irish general, Owen Roe O’Neill, he used all his&nbsp;influence, both ecclesiastical and political, to prevent its&nbsp;acceptance by others. To a large extent he succeeded. Meeting at Waterford, the clergy condemned the treaty and several&nbsp;towns took up the same attitude. The nuncio’s most pliant&nbsp;helper was now Edward Somerset, earl of Glamorgan, afterwards marquess of Worcester, who had been sent to Ireland by&nbsp;Charles I., and who had entered into communication with&nbsp;Rinuccini when the latter first arrived in that country. Glamorgan bound himself to carry out all the wishes of the nuncio,&nbsp;who intended that he should supplant Ormonde. In September&nbsp;1646 Rinuccini took over the conduct of affairs. He imprisoned his opponents on the council and tried to arrange for&nbsp;an attack on Dublin. But there was no harmony among his&nbsp;subordinates, his military plans failed and soon all parties&nbsp;were tacitly ignoring him. Leaving Kilkenny he stayed for&nbsp;some time in Galway, and in February 1649 he left Ireland.&nbsp;After visiting Rome he returned to Fermo in 1650 and died&nbsp;on the 5th of December 1653.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RIOBAMBA or </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Royabamba,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> a </span><span class="font1">town of Ecuador, capital of the province of Chimborazo, on the railway between Guayaquil and Quito, about 85 m. E.N.E. of the former. Pop. (1900,&nbsp;estimate) 12,000. It stands in a barren, sandy basin of the&nbsp;great central plateau, drained by the Chambo, a tributary of&nbsp;the Pastaza, on the old road running southward from Quito&nbsp;into Peru, 9039 ft. above sea-level, and in full view of the&nbsp;imposing heights of Chimborazo, Carahuairazo (Carguairazo),&nbsp;Tunguragua and Altar. Though 300 ft. lower than Quito,&nbsp;its climate is considerably colder, owing, perhaps, to its more&nbsp;exposed situation and the vicinity of so many snow-clad peaks.&nbsp;It is a town of unusually wide streets and one-storeyed adobe&nbsp;houses, being so laid out and built because of earthquakes.&nbsp;It has very little importance as a commercial or industrial&nbsp;centre, having only a small trade and a few unimportant industries. The present town dates from 1797, when the great&nbsp;earthquake of that year destroyed the old town then situated&nbsp;12 m. W., near the existing village of Cajabamba. The ruins&nbsp;of the old town indicate that it was much larger and finer than&nbsp;its successor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RfO CUARTO, a town of Argentina in the province of Cordoba, 119 m. S. of the city of that name, and about 500 m. N.W.&nbsp;of Buenos Aires. Pop. (1904, estimate) 12,000. It stands&nbsp;1440 ft. above sea-level and about half-way across the great&nbsp;Argentine pampas, on the banks of a river of the same name&nbsp;which finds an outlet through the Carcaranal into the Parana&nbsp;near Rosario. The town is built on the open plain and is&nbsp;surrounded with attractive suburbs. It is the commercial&nbsp;centre of a large district and has a large and lucrative trade.&nbsp;Its geographical position gives it great strategical importance,&nbsp;and the government maintains here a large arsenal and a&nbsp;garrison of the regular army. The surrounding country belongs&nbsp;to the partially arid pampa region and is devoted to stock-raising—cattle, horses, sheep and goats. Irrigation is employed in its immediate vicinity. Previous to 1872 this region&nbsp;was overrun by the Ranqueles, a warlike tribe of Indians, but&nbsp;the vigorous reprisals of General Ivanovski in that year,&nbsp;supplemented by the tactful intervention of the Franciscan&nbsp;missionaries, who have a convent in this town, put an end to&nbsp;these hostile forays and gave full opportunity for the industrial&nbsp;development of the country. There are some manufacturing&nbsp;industries in the town. The National Andine railway passes&nbsp;through Rio Cuarto, and branch lines connect with the Buenos&nbsp;Aires and Pacific line—all of which give railway communication</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
