<p><span class="font0">that territory by telegraph with British possessions iri the south. In the following year, 1893, it was found inevitable to fight the&nbsp;Matabele, and a war, prosecuted with a success that is perhaps&nbsp;unique of its kind, placed the country entirely in British hands.&nbsp;The territory thus added to the British empire covered an&nbsp;extent of 450,000 square miles, of which large portions consist&nbsp;of healthy uplands suitable for white colonization. The pioneer&nbsp;party who constructed the first road and founded the first&nbsp;British stations in the country received their orders to cross&nbsp;the frontier in the end of 1889. By the end of 1899, before the&nbsp;outbreak of the South African War, though the country had&nbsp;passed through the trial of a war, two native rebellions, and the&nbsp;scourge of rinderpest, it had become, under the name of Rhodesia,&nbsp;a well-settled province of the British empire, with a white population of some 12,000 to 13,000 persons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The six years which followed the granting of the charter may be regarded as the most successful of a singularly successful&nbsp;life. In 1890, not many months after the granting of the charter,&nbsp;Mr Rhodes accepted the position of prime minister of the Cape.&nbsp;He was maintained in power very largely by the Dutch vote,&nbsp;which he spared no pains to conciliate; and having the confidence&nbsp;of both political sections of the colony, he found himself practically&nbsp;in a position to play the part of benevolent despot in South&nbsp;Africa. He used the position well so far as the public was&nbsp;concerned. While his scheme of northern expansion was making&nbsp;the rapid progress which has been indicated, he did much to&nbsp;elevate and to enlarge the field of local politics. He frankly&nbsp;declared and worked for the policy of uniting British and Dutch&nbsp;interests in South Africa; he took a keen interest in local education. He also during this period carried through some important&nbsp;reforms in native policy. He had the courage to restrict the&nbsp;franchise, introducing an educational test and limiting the exercise&nbsp;of voting power to men enjoying an income equal to a labourer’s&nbsp;wage—thus abolishing, without making any distinction of colour,&nbsp;the abuses of what was known as the “ blanket ” vote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But his native policy was far from being one of simple restriction. He liked the natives; he employed them by thousands in the mining industry, he kept native servants habitually about&nbsp;his person, he seemed to understand their peculiarities and was&nbsp;singularly successful in dealing with them. The first canon of&nbsp;his native policy was that liquor should be kept from them;&nbsp;the second, that they should be encouraged to labour, and&nbsp;guaranteed the full possession of their earnings; the third, that&nbsp;they should be educated in the practical arts of peace. He&nbsp;appreciated the full importance of raising their territorial condition from one of tribal to individual tenure; and while he&nbsp;protested against the absurdity of permitting the uncivilized&nbsp;Kaffir to vote on questions of highly civilized white policy,&nbsp;he believed in applying to the native for his own native affairs&nbsp;the principle of self-government. Of these views some received&nbsp;practical embodiment in the much-disputed act known as the&nbsp;Glen Grey Act of 1894. In this connexion it may also be noted&nbsp;that he was one of the warmest and most convinced supporters&nbsp;of Lovedale, the very successful missionary institution for the&nbsp;education of natives in South Africa.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The position of benevolent despot has obvious drawbacks. In Mr Rhodes’s case the dependence which the populations of&nbsp;Cape Colony were led to place on him had its reaction on the&nbsp;public in a demoralizing loss of self-reliance, and for himself it&nbsp;must be admitted that the effect on the character of a man&nbsp;already much disposed to habits of absolutism in thought and&nbsp;action was the reverse of beneficial. Mr Rhodes felt himself&nbsp;to be far stronger than any man in his own surroundings; he&nbsp;knew himself to be actuated by disinterested motives in the&nbsp;aims which he most earnestly desired to reach. He was profoundly impressed by a sense of the shortness of life, and he&nbsp;so far abused his power as to become intolerant of any sort of&nbsp;control or opposition. The inevitable result followed, that&nbsp;though Mr Rhodes did much of great and good work during&nbsp;the six years of his supreme power, he entirely failed during&nbsp;that period to surround himself, as he might have done, by a&nbsp;circle of able men fit to comprehend and to carry on the work&nbsp;to which his own best efforts were directed. Towork with him&nbsp;was practically impossible for those who were not willing to&nbsp;accept without demur the yoke of dogmatic authority He&nbsp;had a few devoted personal friends, who appreciated his aims&nbsp;and were inspired by his example; but he was lacking in regard&nbsp;for individuals, and a great part of his daily life was spent in&nbsp;the company of satellites and instruments, whom he used with&nbsp;cynical unconcern for the furtherance of his ends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1896 the brilliant period of his premiership was brought to an end by the incident which became famous under the&nbsp;name of the Jameson Raid. The circumstances which led to&nbsp;the Raid belong properly to the history of the Transvaal. It&nbsp;is enough to say briefly here that the large alien population&nbsp;which had been attracted to the Transvaal by the phenomenal&nbsp;wealth of the Johannesburg goldfields, conceiving themselves&nbsp;to have reason to revolt against the authority of the Transvaal&nbsp;government, resolved towards the end of 1895 to have recourse&nbsp;to arms in order to obtain certain reforms. Mr Rhodes, as&nbsp;a large mine-owner, was theoretically a member of the mining&nbsp;population. In this capacity he was asked to give his countenance to the movement. But as prime minister of a British&nbsp;colony he was evidently placed in a false position from the&nbsp;moment in which he became cognizant of a secret attempt&nbsp;to overturn a neighbouring government by force of arms.&nbsp;He did more than become cognizant. The subsequent finding&nbsp;of a Cape committee, which he accepted as accurate, was to&nbsp;the effect that “ in his capacity as controller of the three great&nbsp;joint-stock companies, the British South Africa Company, the&nbsp;De Beers Consolidated Mines, and the Gold Fields of South&nbsp;Africa, he directed and controlled the combination which&nbsp;rendered such a proceeding as the Jameson Raid possible.”&nbsp;He gave money, arms and influence to the movement; and&nbsp;as the time fixed for the outbreak of the revolution approached,&nbsp;he allowed Dr Jameson, who was then administrator of the&nbsp;British South Africa Company in Rhodesia, to move an armed&nbsp;force of some 500 men upon the frontier. Here Mr Rhodes’s&nbsp;participation in the movement came to an end. It became&nbsp;abundantly clear from subsequent inquiry that he was not&nbsp;personally responsible for what followed. A cipher correspondence, seized and published by the Boers, left the civilized&nbsp;world in no doubt as to Mr Rhodes’s share in the previous&nbsp;preparation, and he was for a time believed to be responsible&nbsp;for the Raid itself. Subsequent inquiries held by committees&nbsp;of the Cape parliament and of the British House of Commons&nbsp;acquitted him entirely of responsibility for Dr Jameson’s final&nbsp;movement, but both committees found that he had acted in&nbsp;a manner which was inconsistent with his duty as prime&nbsp;minister of the Cape and managing director of the British South&nbsp;Africa Company.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He displayed, in the circumstances, characteristic qualities of pluck and candour. He made no concealment of his own&nbsp;share in the catastrophe; he took full responsibility for what&nbsp;had been done in his name by subordinates, and he accepted&nbsp;all the consequences which ensued. He resigned his premier-; ship of the Cape (January 1896); and, recognizing that his&nbsp;presence was no longer useful in thé colony, he turned his&nbsp;attention to Rhodesia. His design was to live in that country,&nbsp;and to give all the stimulus of his own presence and encouragement to the development of its resources. The Matabele&nbsp;rebellion of March 1896 intervened to prevent the immediate&nbsp;realization of his plans. In June Imperial troops were sent up,&nbsp;and by the end of July the result of the military operations&nbsp;had driven the natives to the Matoppo Hills, where they held&nbsp;a practically impregnable position. The prospect was of continued war, with a renewal of a costly campaign in the following&nbsp;year. Mr Rhodes conceived the idea that he might effect&nbsp;single-handed the pacification which military skill had failed&nbsp;to compel. To succeed, it was essential that he should trust&nbsp;and be trusted. He accordingly moved his tent away from&nbsp;the troops to the base of the Matoppo Hills. He lay there&nbsp;quietly for six weeks, in the power of the enemy if they had&nbsp;chosen to attack. Word was circulated among the natives</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
