It is usually a term applied to women, and a “ common scold ” (in Low Lat. <hi rend="italic">communis rixatrix)</hi> was indictable in England at common law as a public nuisance, special instruments of punishment being devised in the “ branks ” or “ scold’s bridle,” and the “ cucking stool.” The word is apparently an adaptation of the Norse <hi rend="italic">skald,</hi> skald or scald, a poet, and according to the <hi rend="italic">New English Dictionary</hi> the intermediate meaning through which the sense develops is “ libeller ” or “ lampooner.” Skeat derives from Du. <hi rend="italic">schold, schellen,</hi> and takes the word as originally meaning a loud talker, cf. Icel. <hi rend="italic">skjalla,</hi> to clash, Ger. <hi rend="italic">schallen.</hi> The Norse word is also to be connected in this case, the “ skald ” being one who talks loudly.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
