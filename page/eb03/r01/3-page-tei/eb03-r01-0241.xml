You need only compare them with ſome of theſe, to be convinced that the drinker of wine excels the drinker of beer and water, both in body and mind, and that the inhabitant of the ſouth is much ſſouter than he who lives in the north ; for though the wine drinker may not have quite as much fleſh as he who drinks only beer, he has better blood, and can bear much more work. Tacitus had already obſerved this, in his treatiſe <hi rend="italic">De moribus Germanorum.</hi>  “ The large and corpulent bodies of the Germans (ſays he) have a great appearance, but are not made to laſt.” At that time almoſt all the Germans drank only water ; but the mere drinking of wine has effected a revolution in ſeveral parts of Germany, which makes the preſent inhabitants of theſe countries very different from thoſe deſcribed by Tacitus. Black and brown hair is much commoner here than the white, which made the Germans ſo famous in old Rome. “ It wili be eaſily imagined (ſays Baron Reiſheck), that the monks fare particularly well in fo rich a country, we made a viſit to the prelate of Erbach. Theſe lordly monks, for ſo in every reſpect they are, have an excellent hunt, rooms magnificently furniſhed, billiard tables, half a dozen beautiful ſinging women, and a ſtu-pendous wine cellar, the well ranged batteries of which made me ſhudder. A monk, who ſaw my aſto-niſhment at the number of the caſks, affured me, that, without the benign influence which flowed from them, it would be totally impoffible for the cloiſter to ſubſiſt in fo damp a ſituation.”</p><p>RHINFELS, a caſtle of Germany, in the circle oſ the Lower Rhine, in a county of the ſame name. It is looked upon as one of the moſt important places ſeated on the Rhine, as well in regard to its ſtrength as ſituation. It is near St Goar, and built on a craggy rock. This fortrefs commands the whole breadth of the Rhine, and thoſe who paſs are always obliged to pay a conſiderable toll. In the time of war it is of great importance to be maſters of this place. E. Long. 7. 43. N.

The name is entirely Greek ; but theſe animals were totally unknown to the ancient Greeks. Ariſtotle takes no notice of them, nor any other Greek writer till Strabo, nor Roman till Pliny. It is probable they did not frequent that part of India into which Alexander had penetrated, ſince it was near 300 years after that Pompey brought them to Europe. From this time till the days of Heliogabalus, the rhinoceros was frequently exhibited in the Roman ſpectacles ; and he has often been transported into Europe in more modern times ; but they were long very ill repreſented, and very imperfectly de-ſcribed, till ſome that arrived in London in 1739 and 1741 were inſpected, by which the errors and caprices of former writers were detected.</p><p>Ί here are two ſpecies of rhinoceros, the ſirſt of which is the <hi rend="italic">unicornis,</hi>  the length of which, Buffon tells us, from the extremity of the muzzle to the origin of the tail, is at leaſt 12 ſeet, and the circumference of the body is nearly the ſame. " The rhinoceros which came to London in the year 1739 was ſent from Bengal. Though not above two years of age, the expence of his food and journey amounted to near L. 1000 Sterling. He was fed with rice, ſugar, and hay. He had daily ſeven pounds of rice, mixed with three pounds of ſugar, and divided into three portions. He had likewife hay and green herbs, which laſt he preferred to hay. His drink was water, of which he took large quantities at a time @@(A). He was of a peaceable diſpoſition, and allowed all parts of his body to be touched, when hungry, or ſtruck by any per-ſon, he became miſehievous, and in both caſes nothing appeaſed him but food, when enraged, he ſprung forward, and nimbly raiſed himſelf to a great height, puſhing at the ſame time his head ſuriouily againſt the walls, which he performed with amazing quickneſs, notwithſtanding his heavy aſpect and unwieldy maſs. I often obſerved, ſays Dr Parſons, theſe movements produced by rage or impatience, eſpecially in the mornings before his rice and ſugar were brought to him. The vivacity and promptitude of his movements, Dr Parſons adds, led me to think, that he is altogether unconquerable, and that he could eaſily overtake any man who ſhould offend him.</p><p>" This rhinoceros, at the age of two years, was not taller than a young cow that has never produced. But his body was very long and very thick. His head was diſproportionally large. From the ears to the horn there is a concavity, the two extremities of which, namely the upper end of the muzzle, and the part near the ears, are conſiderably raiſed. The horn, which was not yet above an'inch high, was black, ſmooth at thc top, but full of wrinkles directed backward at the baſe. The noſtrils are ſituated very low, being not above an inch diſtant from the opening of the mouth. The under lip is pretty ſimilar to that of the ox ; but the upper lip has a greater reſemblance to that of the hoiſe, with this advantageous difference, that the rhinoceros can lengthen this lip, move it from ſide to fide, roll it about a ſtaſſ, and ſeize with it any object he wiſhes to carry to liis mouth. Tlie tongue of tliis young rhinoceros was ſoft, like that of a calf. His eyes had no vivacity : In figure they reſembled thoſe of tlie hog, and were ſituated lower, or nearer the noſtrils, than in any other quadruped. His ears are large, thin at the extremities, and contracted at their origin by a kind of annular rugoſity. I'he neck is very ſhort, and ſurronnded with two large folds of ſkin. The ſhoulders aie very thick, and at their juncture there is another fold oſ ſkin, whieh deſeends upon the fore legs. The body of this young rhinoceros was very thick, and pretty much reſembled that oſ a cow about to bring ſorth. Between the body and crupper there is another fold, which deſeends upon the hind legs, Laſtly, another fold tranfverfely ſurrounds the inferior part of the crupper, at ſome diſtance from the tail. The belly was large, and hung near the ground, particularly its middle part. The legs are round, thick, ſtrong, and</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a) " Their food in a ſtate of nature is the groſſeſt herbs, as thiſtles and thorny ſhrubs, which they prefer to bhe foft paſture of the beſt meadows ; they are fond of the ſugar cane, and eat all kinds of grain, but for fleſh they have no appetite.”</hi></p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
