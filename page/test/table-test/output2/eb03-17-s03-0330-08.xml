parance of the ſhadow, according to the laws of perspective, The method <hi rend="italic">is</hi> this: From the luminous body, which is here considered as a point, let fall a perpendicular to the perſpective plane or table ; <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> find the appearance of a point upon which a perpendicular, drawn from the middle of the luminary, falls on the perſpective plane ; and from the ſeveral angles, or raiſed points of the body, let fall perpendiculars to the plane. Theſe points, whereon the perpendiculars fall, connect by right lines, with the point upon which the perpendicular let fall from the luminary falls ; and continue the lines to the side oppoſite to the luminary. Lastly, through the raiſed points draw lines through the centre of the luminary, intersecting the former ; the points of intersection are the terms or bounds of the ſhadow.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
