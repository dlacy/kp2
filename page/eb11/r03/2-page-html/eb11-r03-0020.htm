Among its manufactures are agricultural machinery (especially seeding machines) and tools, automobiles, pianos, lawn-mowers, roller-skates,&nbsp;foundry and machine-shop products, furniture, burial caskets,&nbsp;and flour. In 1905 its factory product was valued at $6,731,740,&nbsp;an increase of 41-6% since 1900. Pipe lines supply the city with&nbsp;natural gas. The municipality owns and operates the electric lighting&nbsp; plant. In 1806 Friends from North Carolina and&nbsp;Pennsylvania settled near here, and Richmond was platted in&nbsp;1816. Its growth was slow until the opening of the National&nbsp;Road, which entered Indiana near the city, and the construction&nbsp;of railways. Richmond was incorporated as a village in 1818&nbsp;and chartered as a borough in 1834 and as a city in 1840.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHMOND, a city and the county-seat of Madison county, Kentucky, U.S.A., about 95 m. S.E. of Louisville. Pop. (1890)&nbsp;5073; (1900) 4653, of whom 2087 were negroes; (1910) 5340.&nbsp;It is served by the Louisville &amp; Atlantic and the Louisville&nbsp;&amp; Nashville railways. It is situated in the “ Blue Grass Region/&nbsp;near the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains. It is the&nbsp;seat of Madison Institute for girls (1856) and of the Eastern&nbsp;Kentucky State Normal School (1906). From 1874 to 1901 it&nbsp;was the seat of Central University, which in the latter year was&nbsp;consolidated with Centre College at Danville, Ky. (q.v.). The&nbsp;surrounding country is devoted largely to the cultivation of&nbsp;tobacco, Indian corn and wheat, and the breeding of fine horses&nbsp;and cattle; and Richmond is an important live-stock market.&nbsp;Among the manufactures are bricks, flour, tobacco and cigars,&nbsp;and carriages. On the 30th of August 1862 a Confederate force&nbsp;of about 7000 men under General Edmund Kirby Smith won a&nbsp;decisive victory here over a Union force of a nearly equal&nbsp;number under Generals Mahlon D. Manson (1820-1895) and&nbsp;William Nelson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHMOND, a municipal borough in the Kingston parliamentary division of Surrey, England, 9 m. W.S.W. of Charing Cross, London. Pop. (1891) 26,875; (1901) 31,672. It lies&nbsp;on the right bank of the Thames, which is here crossed by&nbsp;a bridge carrying the road to Twickenham. Through its&nbsp;pleasant situation Richmond has grown into a large residential&nbsp;suburb of the metropolis. The town was anciently called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Syenes</span><span class="font0"> and afterwards </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Schene</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sheen</span><span class="font0"> (a name preserved in&nbsp;the village of East Sheen, adjacent on the London side) until&nbsp;the name was in 1500 changed to Richmond by command of&nbsp;Henry VII., who was earl of Richmond in Yorkshire. It grew up&nbsp;round the royal manor house, which became a frequent residence&nbsp;of sovereigns, but of which nothing more than a gateway remains.&nbsp;Edward I. received the Scotch commissioners at his manor of&nbsp;Sheen in 1300. The palace was rebuilt by Edward III., who&nbsp;died here in 1377. It was frequently used by Richard II., and&nbsp;here his wife Anne of Bohemia died, upon which he cursed the&nbsp;place and “ caused it to be thrown down and defaced.” By&nbsp;Henry V., however, it was rebuilt, and a great tournament was&nbsp;held here in 1492 by Henry VII., who after its destruction by&nbsp;fire in 1498 restored it. Henry VIII. gave it to Wolsey to&nbsp;reside in, after the latter presented him with the new palace of&nbsp;Hampton Court. James I. settled it on his son Henry, prince&nbsp;of Wales, who restored and embellished it at great expense.&nbsp;Charles I. added to it the new deer park generally known as&nbsp;Richmond Park, 2253 acres in extent, which is surrounded by&nbsp;a wall 11 m. in length. After the execution of the king, the&nbsp;parliament presented the park to the citizens of London, who&nbsp;again presented it to Charles II. at the Restoration. Though&nbsp;partly dismantled, the palace was the residence of the queen&nbsp;dowager till 1665, and by James II. it was used as a nursery&nbsp;for the young prince; but, gradually falling into decay, it was&nbsp;parcelled into tenements about 1720. In the old deer park&nbsp;extending northwards from the site of the palace, Kew Observatory was erected in 1769, occupying the site of a Carthusian&nbsp;convent founded by Henry V., and a dwelling-house in which&nbsp;Swift for some time resided. The White Lodge was built by&nbsp;George I., and has been a residence of various members of the&nbsp;royal family. To the south-east of the town, at the entrance&nbsp;to Richmond Park, is Richmond Hill, from which is seen a&nbsp;famous view of the Thames with the surrounding country to the&nbsp;west. This view was secured to the public by an agreement,&nbsp;sealed on the 7th of February 1896, between the corporation&nbsp;and the trustees of the earl of Dysart, by an act of Parliament&nbsp;of 1902, and by the acquisition in the same year, by the London&nbsp;County Council, with the assistance of the borough of Richmond&nbsp;and other interested local authorities, of the Marble Hill Estate&nbsp;and other property on the Middlesex shore. The church of St&nbsp;Mary Magdalen is of considerable antiquity, but almost entirely&nbsp;rebuilt; it contains a large number of monuments to celebrated&nbsp;persons. A theatre, first established in 1719, was during his later&nbsp;years leased by Edmund Kean. The town has a Wesleyan&nbsp;theological college, founded in 1834. Richmond, which was&nbsp;incorporated in 1890, is governed by a mayor, 10 aldermen and&nbsp;30 councillors. The borough includes Kew </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cq.v.},</span><span class="font0"> Petersham&nbsp;and North Sheen. Area, 2491 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICHMOND, a market town and municipal borough in the Richmond parliamentary division of the North Riding of&nbsp;Yorkshire, England, 50 m. N.W. from York, the terminus&nbsp;of a branch of the North-Eastern railway. Pop. (1901)&nbsp;3837. It is finely ‘situated on the left bank of the Swale, the&nbsp;valley of which is narrow and the banks steep. The interest&nbsp;of the town centres in the castle founded about 1071 by Alan&nbsp;Rufus, a son of Odo, count of Penthièvre in Brittany, who is&nbsp;also said to have rebuilt the town on obtaining from William&nbsp;the Conqueror, among other possessions, the estates of the&nbsp;Saxon earl Edwin, embracing some two hundred manors of&nbsp;Richmond and extending over nearly a third of the North&nbsp;Riding. This tract, comprising five wapentakes, was called&nbsp;Richmondshire at this time, but the date of the creation of&nbsp;the shire is uncertain. When Henry VII. came to the throne&nbsp;these possessions reverted to the crown. Henry VIII. gave&nbsp;them to his son Henry, afterwards duke of Richmond, by a&nbsp;daughter of Sir John Blount, and Charles II. bestowed the&nbsp;title of duke of Richmond on his son by the duchess of Portsmouth. The castle is situated on a perpendicular rock rising&nbsp;about 100 ft. above the Swale, and from its great strength was&nbsp;considered impregnable. Originally it covered an area of&nbsp;5 acres, but the only portions of it remaining are the Norman&nbsp;keep, with pinnacled tower and walls 100 ft. high by 11 ft.&nbsp;thick, and some other smaller towers. The view from the&nbsp;keep is very fine, extending westward up the bold valley and&nbsp;Overthehillswhich wallit, and eastward over the rich plain&nbsp;of the centre of the county. The church of St Mary is transitional Norman, Decorated and Perpendicular, and is largely&nbsp;restored. The church of the Holy Trinity retains only the&nbsp;nave and the detached tower. The building is ancient but was&nbsp;restored to use from ruins. Close to the town are ruins of&nbsp;Easby Abbey, a Premonstratensian foundation by Roald,&nbsp;constable of Richmond Castle in 1152, beautifully situated by&nbsp;the river. The remains, which are considerable, include a&nbsp;Decorated gateway, an Early English chapel and fragments&nbsp;of the transepts and choir of the church, with sufficient portions&nbsp;of the domestic buildings to enable the complete plan to be&nbsp;traced. For the free grammar-school founded by Elizabeth&nbsp;a Gothic building was erected in 1850, in memory of the Rev.&nbsp;James Tate, a former master. The tower of a Franciscan&nbsp;abbey founded in 1258 remains. The chief modem buildings&nbsp;are the town hall, market hall and ‘the mechanics’ institute.&nbsp;The principal trade is in agricultural produce, but there are a&nbsp;paper mill and an iron and brass foundry. An annual meeting&nbsp;is held on the racecourse in September. In 1889 Richmond&nbsp;became the seat of a suffragan bishop in the diocese of Ripon.&nbsp;The town is governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors.&nbsp;Area, 2520 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The nameof Richmond (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Richemont, Richemund)</span><span class="font0"> has not been traced further back than 1145 But it is probable that there was a settlement on the site of the present town before that date. Possibly&nbsp;it was the Hindrelaghe of the Domesday Survey, a place which,&nbsp;although large enough to have a church in 1086, appears to have&nbsp;vanished before the close of the 12th century. As far as is known&nbsp;the earliest charter was granted in 1145. But a later charter&nbsp;(1146) shows that the burgesses had enjoyed some municipal</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
