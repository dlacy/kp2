        <p><span class="font0">on the 23rd of June an unexpected sortie of the Russian Port Arthur
                squadron paralysed the Japanese land offensive. In&nbsp;the squadron were seen the
                battleships damaged in the February&nbsp;attacks, and the balance of force was now
                against Togo, who&nbsp;had lost the “ Yashima ” and the “ Hatsuse.” The
                squadron&nbsp;nevertheless tamely returned to harbour, Togo resumed
                the&nbsp;blockade and Nogi began his advance from Nanshan, but the&nbsp;2nd and 4th
                Armies came to a standstill at once (naval escort&nbsp;for their sea-borne supplies
                being no longer available), and the&nbsp;1st Army, whose turn to advance had just
                arrived, only pushed&nbsp;ahead a few miles to cover a larger supply area. On the
                1st of&nbsp;July the Vladivostok squadron appeared in the Tsushima&nbsp;Straits, and
                then vanished to an unknown destination, and&nbsp;whether this intensified the
                anxiety </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">6f</span><span
                class="font0"> the Japanese or not, It&nbsp;is the fact that the 2nd Army halted for
                eleven days at Kaiping,&nbsp;bringing the next on its right, 4th Army, to a
                standstill likewise.&nbsp;Its next advance brought it to the fortified position of
                Tashichiao,&nbsp;where Kuropatkin had, by drawing heavily upon his
                central&nbsp;reserve and even on the Eastern Detachment, massed about two&nbsp;army
                corps.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">On the 24th Oku attacked, but the Russian general, Zarubayev, handled
                his troops very skilfully, and the Japanese were repulsed&nbsp;with a loss of 1200
                men. Zarubayev, who had used&nbsp;only about half his forces in the battle,
                nevertheless&nbsp;retired in the night, fearing to be cut off by a descent&nbsp;of
                the approaching 4th Army on Haicheng, and well content&nbsp;to have broken the spell
                of defeat. Oku renewed the attack&nbsp;next day, but found only a rearguard in front
                of him, and&nbsp;without following up the retiring Russians he again halted
                for&nbsp;six days before proceeding to Haicheng to effect a junction&nbsp;with the
                4th Army (Nozu), which meantime had won a number&nbsp;of minor actions and forced
                the passage of the mountains at</span></p>

        <p><span class="font0">The 1st Army, after its long halt at Feng-hwang-cheng, which was
                employed in minutely organizing the supply service—a&nbsp;task of exceptional
                difficulty in these roadless mountains—reopened the campaign on the 24th of June,
                but only tentatively&nbsp;on account of the discouraging news from Port Arthur.
                A&nbsp;tremendous rainstorm imposed further delays, for the coolies&nbsp;and the
                native transport that had been laboriously collected&nbsp;scattered in all
                directions. The Motienling pass, however, had&nbsp;been seized without difficulty,
                and Keller’s power of counterattack had been reduced to nothing by the despatch of
                most of&nbsp;his forces to the concentration at Tashichiao. But Oku’s 2nd&nbsp;Army
                was now at a standstill at Kaiping, and until he was&nbsp;further advanced the 1st
                Army could not press forward. The&nbsp;captured passes were therefore fortified (as
                Feng-hwang-cheng&nbsp;had been) for passive resistance. This, and the movements
                of&nbsp;the 4th Army, which had set its face towards Haicheng and&nbsp;no longer
                seemed to be part of a threat on Liao-Yang, led to&nbsp;the idea being entertained
                at Kuropatkin’s headquarters that&nbsp;the centre of gravity was shifting to the
                south. To clear up the&nbsp;situation Keller’s force was augmented and ordered to
                attack&nbsp;Kuroki. It was repulsed with a loss of nearly 1000 men in
                the&nbsp;action at the Motienling (17th July), but it was at least ascertained that
                considerable forces were still on the Japanese right,&nbsp;and upon the arrival of a
                fresh army corps from Europe&nbsp;Kuropatkin announced his intention of
                attacking&nbsp;Kuroki. And in effect he succeeded in concentrating&nbsp;the
                equivalent of an army corps, in addition to Keller’s&nbsp;force, opposite to
                Kuroki’s right. But having secured this&nbsp;advantage he stood still for five days,
                and Kuroki had ample&nbsp;time to make his arrangements. The Japanese general
                occupied&nbsp;some 20 m. of front in two halves, separated by 6 m. of
                impassable&nbsp;mountain, and knowing well the danger of a “ cordon ”
                defensive,&nbsp;he met the crisis in another and a bolder fashion. Calling in
                the&nbsp;brigade detached to the assistance of Nozu as well as all
                other&nbsp;available fractions of his scattered army, he himself attacked</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font0">on the 31st of July, all along the line. It was little more than
                    an assertion of his will to conquer, but it was effectual. On his&nbsp;left wing
                    the attacks of the Guard and 2nd divisions (action of&nbsp;Yang-tzu-ling) on the
                    Russian front and flank failed, the frontal&nbsp;attack because of the resolute
                    defence, the flank attack from&nbsp;sheer fatigue of the troops. Count Keller
                    was killed in the&nbsp;defence. Meantime on the Japanese right the 12th
                    division&nbsp;attacked the large bodies of troops that Kuropatkin had
                    massed&nbsp;(Yu-shu-ling) equally in vain. But one marked success
                    was&nbsp;achieved by the Japanese. The Russian 35th and 36th regiments (10th
                    European Corps) were caught between two advancing columns, and, thanks to the
                    initiative of one of the column&nbsp;leaders, Okasaki, destroyed. At night,
                    discouraged on each&nbsp;wing by the fall of Count Keller and the fate of the
                    35th and&nbsp;36th, the whole Russian force retired on Anping, with a loss
                    of&nbsp;2400, to the Japanese 1000 men.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">This was the only manifestation of the offensive spirit on
                    Kuropatkin’s part during the six months of marking time.&nbsp;It was for
                    defence, sometimes partial and elastic, sometimes&nbsp;rigid and “
                    at-all-costs,” that he had made his dispositions&nbsp;throughout. His policy now
                    was to retire on Liao-Yang as&nbsp;slowly as possible and to defend himself in a
                    series of concentric&nbsp;prepared positions. In his orders for the battle
                    around&nbsp;his stronghold there is no word of counter-attack,&nbsp;and his
                    central mass, the special weapon of the commander-in-chief, he gave over to
                    Bilderling and to&nbsp;Zarubayev to strengthen the defence in their respective
                    sections or posted • for the protection of his line of&nbsp;retreat.
                    Nevertheless, he had every intention of delivering&nbsp;a heavy and decisive
                    counterstroke when the right moment&nbsp;should come, and meantime his defensive
                    tactics would certainly&nbsp;have full play on this prearranged battlefield with
                    its elaborate&nbsp;redoubts, bombproofs and obstacles, and its garrison of
                    a&nbsp;strength obviously equal (and in reality superior) to that of
                    the&nbsp;assailants.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">The Japanese, too, had effected their object, and as they
                    converged on their objective, the inner flanks of the three armies&nbsp;had
                    connected and the supreme commander Marshal Oyama&nbsp;had taken command of the
                    whole. But, as the event was to&nbsp;prove, the military policy of Japan had
                    failed to produce the&nbsp;requisite number of men for the desired Sedan, and
                    so, instead of&nbsp;boldly pushing out the 1st Army to such a distance that
                    it&nbsp;could manoeuvre, as Moltke did in 1866 and 1870, he attached&nbsp;it to
                    the general fine of battle. It was not in two or three&nbsp;powerful groups but
                    in one long chain of seven deployed&nbsp;divisions that the advance was
                    made.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font0">On the 25th of August the 2nd and 4th Armies from Haicheng and
                    the 1st Army from the Yin-tsu-ling and Yu-shu-ling&nbsp;began the last stage of
                    their convergent advance. The Russian&nbsp;first position extended in a
                    semicircle from Anshantien (on the&nbsp;Liao-Yang-Hai-cheng railway) into the
                    hills at Anping, and&nbsp;thence to the Taitse river above Liao-Yang; both sides
                    had&nbsp;mixed detachments farther out on the flanks. The first step in&nbsp;the
                    Japanese plan was the advance of Kuroki’s army to Anping.&nbsp;Throughout the
                    25th, night of 25th-26th, and 26th&nbsp;of August, Kuroki advanced, fighting
                    heavily all&nbsp;along the line, until on the night of the 26th
                    the&nbsp;defenders gave up the contested ground at Anping. Hitherto&nbsp;there
                    had only been skirmishing on a large scale on the&nbsp;side of Hai-cheng.
                    Kuropatkin having already drawn in&nbsp;his fine of defence on the south side
                    towards Liao-Yang, the&nbsp;2nd and 4th Japanese Armies delivered what was
                    practically a&nbsp;blow in the air. But on the 27th there was a marked
                    change&nbsp;in the Japanese plan. The right of the 1st Army, when about&nbsp;to
                    continue the advance west on Liao-Yang, was diverted&nbsp;northward by Oyama’s
                    orders and ordered to prepare to cross&nbsp;the Taitszeho. The retirement of the
                    Russian Southern Force&nbsp;into its entrenchments emboldened the Japanese
                    commander-in-chief to imitate Moltke’s method to the full. On the
                    28th,&nbsp;however, the 1st Army made scarcely any progress. The&nbsp;right
                    (12th) division reached the upper Taitszeho, but the&nbsp;divisions that were to
                    come up on its left were held fast by their</span></p><div>

                        now&nbsp;returned to Feng-hwang-cheng.</span></p></div><br clear="all" />
