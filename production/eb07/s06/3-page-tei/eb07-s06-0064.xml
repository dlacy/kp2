Those tribes of the Turkmans appear in their winter-quarters in the plain of Antioch at the end of September, and depart towards the middle of April, when the flies of the plain begin to torment their horses and cattle. They then begin to direct their march towards Marasch, and remain in the neighbourhood of that place for about a month; thence they reach the mountains to the east, where they pass the hottest summer months ; and in autumn they return by the same route towards Antioch. They live in tents and in huts. Those tents are always surrounded by four others, in which live the Fellah families, who cultivate the land. These are the remaining peasants of abandoned villages, or some poor stragglers from the mountains of Kurdistan, who live wretchedly; and when they succeed in scraping together a small pittance, their Turkman masters contrive to take it from them under pretence of borrowing it.</p><p><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note>power of this formidable sect was at length undertaken by Mehemet Ali, the present pacha of Egypt, who sent Ibrahim with a numerous force, and a vast retinue of camels and other beasts of burden, with large supplies, and succeeded, after many bloody conflicts, in taking their capital, and Abdallah their chief, who was sent prisoner to Constantinople, and there beheaded.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> Syria, after the extinction of the Wahaby power, was ruled as before by Turkish pachas, the vassals of the Porte, who oppressed the country by exactions, and left the poor peasantry scarcely a bare subsistence. When a just administration, with which they are occasionally blessed, left them the produce of their fertile soil, they were prosperous and happy, as they were propor- tionably miserable under those cruel tyrants, in whose hands power was only used for extortion.But a new era was now approaching, when Syria, in the progressive decline of the Turkish dominion, was to pass under the yoke of a new and even more severe task-master. The pacha of Egypt, Mehemet Ali, had been long aspiring at independent power; and having collected and disciplined a powerful army, he at length threw off the mask, and in October 1831 invaded Syria by El Arish, and after taking possession of Gaza and Jaffa, he laid siege to St Jean d’Acre, the memorable scene of so many sanguinary conflicts. The place was strong, and resolutely defended by Abdallah Pacha. The siege had continued three months, during which the town was reduced to a heap of ruins. The Egyptian army had also suffered severely. In the mean time, Osman, the bey of Tripoli, having collected a force of 5000, proceeded to the attack of Tripoli, on the sea-coast. Ibrahim hastened with 5000 troops and six pieces of artillery to this new scene of action, and on the 31st of March 1832 succeeded in putting Osman to flight after a severe engagement. He retired across the mountains to Hamah ; and Ibrahim following, encamped on the plains of Homs, where he was attacked on the l5th of April by a Turkish force, and after a drawn battle, retired on Baalbec. In the mean time Mehemet Ali, impressed with the importance of gaining possession of Acre, sent reinforcements from Candia ; and Ibrahim resuming ,the command, pressed the siege with redoubled vigour, and on the 15th of May the place capitulated after a severe struggle, Abdallah and the garrison being made prisoners of war. Mehemet Ali, following up his success, advanced on the 8th of June on Damascus, which he entered on the l4th. He was joined by the Christian population of Mount Lebanon, and by their aged emir with 5000 men. The victorious army resumed its march northwards for Aleppo ; and at Homs, on the head streams of the Orontes, he was encountered by a Turkish force of 20,000 men, which was completely routed, with the loss of tents, provisions, ammunition, and thirty-one pieces of cannon. Ibrahim now divided his force, sending one detachment to Antioch, and advancing with the other towards Aleppo. Hearing that the Turkish army had now entered Syria under Husseyn Pacha, he proceeded to meet the enemy. The Turkish position was one of great natural strength, accessible only by a defile. Troops were posted along all the heights, which were besides crowned with artillery. The Egyptian army reached the pass on the 28th of July ; and the following morning, having silenced the enemy’s batteries by his superior fire, Ibrahim carried the heights by main force. The victory was complete ; the loss of the Turks amounted to 13,000 men, and forty pieces of cannon were left on the field. The fruit of this victory was the surrender of Antioch, and the submission of the whole north-eastern portion of Syria. Another battle was fought on the 2lst of December 1832, ; when the Turkish army, amounting to 40,000 men, with sixty pieces of cannon, was entirely routed and dispersed.Syria is a country of ancient renown, and connected with many interesting historical recollections. In the early periods of the Jewish history, it was a powerful state, of which Damascus was the capital. Phoenicia, the great commercial state of those ancient times, flourished in Syria, and sent out colonies to other countries. Syria was, after the death of Alexander, erected into an extensive monarchy under Seleucus, one of his lieutenants. It comprehended the whole west of Asia, and under Antiochus maintained a long and doubtful conflict with the Roman power. Under the Roman emperors Syria was the seat of luxury and wealth, and Antioch, the capital, was, next to Rome and Alexandria, one of the first cities in the empire, famed for its riches and splendour. Syria, during the decline of the Roman empire, was overrun by barbarous hordes, and fell under the dominion of the Saracens. It was the great theatre of contention between the crusading armies and those of the Moslems ; and a long and bloody contest, signalized by deeds of valour on both sides, terminated in the triumph of the infidels ; when Syria was finally absorbed in the Turkish empire, of which it formed one of the richest and most valuable provinces. It was ruled by the provincial authority of the pachas, several of whom, in the increasing weakness of the Turkish sway, set up the standard of independent power. Among the earliest of these was Fackerdin, the emir of the Druses, who made himself master of Beirout, and successively of all the towns on the Syrian coast. He was at last defeated and slain by the Turkish force sent against him ; and his posterity continued to administer the affairs of the Druses as vassals of the Porte. Daher, a powerful Arabian scheik, contended for independent power so successfully with the sultan, that for a long time he was obliged to grant him an annual lease of his dominion. He was also subdued by a powerful army sent against him by the Porte, and was put to death. He was succeeded by the well-known Dsjezzar Pacha, who acquired a power almost equally independent, but who, unlike the former pacha, whose administration was mild and just, was a fierce and savage tyrant. His reign was rendered remarkable by the invasion of Syria by Bonaparte, and by his memorable defence of Acre, along with the British under Sir Sidney Smith. After the death of Dsjezzar, Soleiman was appointed pacha; and it was about this period that Syria was first threatened with an invasion by the Wahabis, whose power had been extending for some years, and who would no longer permit the great armed caravans to proceed to Mecca from Damascus. Yussuf Pacha succeeded, and was equally unsuccessful in repelling the incursions of the Wahabis, who, advancing through the Syrian desert, spread terror to the gates of Damascus.
