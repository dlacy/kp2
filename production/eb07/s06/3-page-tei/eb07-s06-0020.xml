The king of Sweden took umbrage at his progress ; and having marched against him, defeated his forces in several slight encounters, and obliged him to acknowledge himself a vassal of Sweden. These rapid conquests alarmed all Europe ; and the different powers sought for means of driving the Swedes out of Poland, which they had so unexpectedly and unjustly seized. The Poles were no sooner assured that they should obtain assistance, than they everywhere revolted and massacred the Swedes. Casimir returned from Silesia ; and those very troops and generals who had before submitted to Charles without opposition, now ranged themselves under the banners of his antagonist. Charles immediately marched from Prussia to chastise the insolence of the Poles, and totally defeated a body of 12,000 men. This event did not hinder all the Poles incorporated with his troops to desert. Their defection considerably reduced his army ; and the campaign being performed in the depth of winter, he was at last obliged to retreat to Prussia. In his march he was harassed by the Poles ; and a body of 4000 Swedes was surprised and defeated by them at Warka. This loss however was soon after recompensed by a complete victory gained by Adolphus the king’s brother, and General Wrangel. In the mean time the king was taking measures for laying siege to Dantzig; but was prevented by the Dutch, who threatened to oppose him, unless a proper regard was paid to their interest. Charles accordingly granted them advantageous terms ; and afterwards gained over the elector of Brandenburg, by ceding to him the sovereignty of Prussia, that he might he at liberty to turn his whole strength against Poland.By the treaty just concluded with the elector, the latter was to assist Charles in his war with Poland ; but the elector was so tardy in his measures, that the Poles, having obtained assistance from the Tartars, had reduced the city of Warsaw. The two princes now marched in concert against their enemies, who were encamped in a strong situation in the neighbourhood of the city above mentioned, their camp being fronted by the Vistula. The Poles were driven from their intrenchments with prodigious slaughter. The Poles and Tartars then laboured to break the alliance ; and with which view, having entered Ducal Prussia, they defeated the electoral army, and took many prisoners. The Swedes soon obtained their revenge. General Steinboek attacked the same Polish army at Philippowa, and overthrew it with such slaughter as obliged the Poles for that season to quit the field. A more formidable enemy than the Poles now began to make their appearance. The Russians invaded the provinces of Carelia, Ingermania, and Livonia ; while the elector of Brandenburg began to waver in his fidelity. To preserve this only ally at such a critical juncture. Charles was obliged to grant him more advantageous terms than those already mentioned ; and the Russians were repulsed in the provinces of Carelia and Ingermania. But in Livonia they had better success. For seven months, however, they battered the walls of Riga, without venturing to pass the ditch or storm the practicable breaches.Charles, notwithstanding the number of his enemies, was now become so formidable by the valour and discipline of his troops, that entire armies often fled on his approach. At last, in 1657, the Poles, finding they could not resist him in the field, contented themselves with harassing the Swedes on their march, and cutting oft’ the foragers and convoys. This proved much more destructive to the Swedes than their former method ; so that Charles was obliged to enter into an alliance with Ragotski, prince of Transylvania, by assigning him certain provinces in his neighbourhood, in order to furnish himself with irregular troops, who might fight the Poles in their own way. He did not thus obtain any real advantage ; for the confederates, after wasting a whole</p><p>over both armies. The courage of the Imperialists revived, and they now made themselves sure of victory. But the Swedes, eager to revenge the death of their beloved monarch, charged with such fury that nothing could resist them. The Imperialists were defeated a second time, just as Pappenheim, with his fresh corps, came up to their assistance. On this the battle was renewed, but the Swedes were still irresistible. Pappenheim was mortally wounded, and his army finally routed, with the loss of 9000 killed in the field and in the pursuit.</p><p>This victory proved more unfortunate to Sweden than the greatest defeat. The crown devolved on Christina, the daughter of Gustavus, an infant of six years old ; the nation was engaged in an expensive foreign war, without any person equal to the arduous task of commanding the armies, or regulating domestic affairs, as Gustavus had done. Christina was immediately proclaimed queen. The regency devolved on the grand bailiff, the marshal, the high admiral, the chancellor, and the treasurer of the crown. Oxen- stiern was invested with the chief management of affairs, and conducted himself with the greatest prudence. The reign and character of Christina have been detailed under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Christina</hi>, to which we may refer our readers.</p><p>From the treaty of Westphalia, Sweden enjoyed some years of repose. Charles Gustavus, Count Palatine, having gained the favour of Christina, was appointed generalissimo of the forces, and heir-apparent to the crown. A marriage was proposed between them ; but the queen would never listen to this or any other proposal of the kind. In 1650, the ceremony of the queen’s coronation was performed; but in four years after, she resigned the crown in favour of Charles.</p><p>The new king found himself involved in considerable difficulties on his accession to the throne. The treasury was quite exhausted ; great part of the revenue was appointed for the support of Christina’s household ; the people were oppressed with taxes ; and the nation having been disarmed for several years, began to lose its reputation among foreigners. To remedy these evils, Charles proposed to resume all the crown-lands which had been alienated by grants to favourites during the late reign ; to repeal a duty which had been imposed on salt ; to put the kingdom in a posture of defence ; and to enter on a war with some neighbouring state. Under a pretence that Casimir king of Poland had questioned his title to the throne, he prepared to invade that kingdom. Several embassies were sent from Poland to Stockholm ; but some point of ceremony always disappointed them of an audience of the king, so that they were obliged to return without executing their commission. As soon as matters were in readiness, General Wittemberg made an irruption into Poland from the side of Pomerania. The Poles opposed him with an army of 15,000 men ; but instead of fighting, they began to negociate, and in a short time entirely dispersed. Charles himself soon followed with a powerful army, and pursued his march without obstruction, all the cities throwing open their gates to him as he approached. As he advanced to Cracow, Casimir resolved to make one effort to save his capital. His army amounted only to 10,000 men ; and these were unfortunately such as had never stood fire. After a feeble resistance, they fled with precipitation, having lost 1000 men killed and taken prisoners. A few days after this Charles defeated the Poles a second time, about eight leagues from Cracow ; on which Casimir fled with his family to Oppeln in Silesia. The capital was then invested, and, though defended with the utmost valour, was in a short time obliged to capitulate. Thus in less than three months Charles apparently became master of Poland·; but it was soon evident that the Poles had no intention of abandoning their former sovereign.</p><p>In 1656, a war took place with the elector of Brandenburg. While Charles was employed in the conquest of Po</p></body></text></TEI>
