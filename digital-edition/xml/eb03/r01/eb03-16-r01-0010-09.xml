                <p><label>RASAY</label> one of the Hebrides Iſlands, is about 13 miles long and 2
                    broad. It contains y00 inhabitants, has plenty of lime-ſtone, free-ſtone ∙, and
                    feeds great numbers of black cattle ; but has neither deers, hares, nor rabbits.
                    The only appearance of a harbour in Rafay is at Clachan Bay, where Mr Macleod
                    the proprietor of the iſland reſides. Raſay preſents a bold ſhore, w <hi
                        rend="sup"> ,</hi> hιch riſes to the height of mountains ; and here the
                    natives have, with incredible labour, formed many little corn fields and patato
                    grounds. Theſe heights decreaſe at the ſouth end, where there are ſome farms and
                    a good-looking country. Mr Macleod is ſole proprietor of this» iſland, and of
                    Rona and Fladda at the north end of 1t <hi rend="sub">ft</hi> which are only
                    proper for grazing.</p>
                <p>The houſe of Raſay is pleaſantly ſituated near the ſouth-weſt end of the iſland,
                    which is the moſt level part of it. It has an extenſive and excellent garden,
                    and is ſurrounded with foreſt trees of considerable magnitude ; another proof
                    that trees will grow upon the edge oſ the ſea-, though it muſt be allowed that

                <p>channel here is narrow. Immediately behind the houſe of Rasay are the ruins of
                    an ancient chapel, now uſed as the family burying-place.</p>
                <p>Dr Johnſon, in his tour, expreſſes the higheſt fatisfaction at the reception he
                    met with when in Raſay from Mr Macleod.</p>
