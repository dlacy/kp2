<p><span class="font1">he was offered the empire and kingdom of Italy, which, however, h.e declined to acςept. Hugh, called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Great,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">whom he had had by Confiance, being dead, he cauſed&nbsp;his ſecond ſon Henry I. to be crowned at Rheims. He&nbsp;died at. Melun, July 20. 103i, at the age of 60. Robert was, according to the knowledge of the times, a&nbsp;wiſe prince. Helgand, friar of Fleury, relates, in his&nbsp;life of him, that, to prevent his ſubjects from falling into the crime of perjuιy, and incurring the penalties which followed thereon, he made them ſwear upon&nbsp;a ſhrine ſrom which the relics had been previouſly removed, as if intention did not conſtitute perjury ! and&nbsp;long after ſimilar reafoning was adopted. Robert built&nbsp;a gſeat number of churches, and procured a reſtitution&nbsp;to the clergy of the tithes and wealth which the lay-lords had made themſelves maſters of. The depredations were ſuch, that the laity poſſeſſed the eccleſiaſti-cal treaſurcs by hereditary titles ; they divided them&nbsp;among their children ; they even gave benefices as a&nbsp;dowry with their daughters, or leſt them to their foils&nbsp;as lawful inheritance. Although Robert was pious,&nbsp;and although he reſpected the clergy, yet it was evident that he oppoſed the biſhops with a firmneſs and&nbsp;reſolution of which, for many ages, they had had no examples. Lutherie archbiſhop of Sens had introduced&nbsp;into his dioceſe the cuſtom of proving by the euchariſt&nbsp;perſons accuſed as guilty of any crime. The king&nbsp;wrote to him in the following ſtrong terms : “ I ſwear&nbsp;(ſays he)'by the ſaith I owe to God, that if you do&nbsp;not put a ſtop to the groſs abuſe complained of, you&nbsp;ſhall be deprived of your prieſthood.” The prelate was&nbsp;forced to comply. He puniſhed, in j022, the Manichéens, canons of Oιleans, by burning them at the&nbsp;ſtake. There are, however, recorded of him ſome leſs&nbsp;ſevere actions, which it is right to mention. A dangerous conſpiracy againſt his perſon and government&nbsp;having been diſcovered, and the authors taken into&nbsp;cuſtody, he ſeized the moment when their judges had&nbsp;met to ſentcnce them to death, to cauſe an elegant&nbsp;iepaſt to be ſerved up to them. Next day they&nbsp;were admitted to the euchariſt. Then Robert told&nbsp;them, that he gave them their pardon, “ becauſe none&nbsp;of thoſe can die whom Jeſiis Chrill came to receive at&nbsp;his table ” One day when he was at prayers in the&nbsp;chapel, he perceived a thief, who had cut off the half of&nbsp;the fringe of his mantle, proceeding to take the remainder ; “ Friend (ſays he with a pleaſant countenance), be content with what you have already taken,&nbsp;the reſt will very well ſerve ſome other.” Robert cultivated, and was a patronizer of the ſciences. There&nbsp;are ſeveral hymns wrote by him, which ſtill continue to&nbsp;be ſung in the church. His reign was happy and tranquil. According to ſome authors, he inſtituted the&nbsp;order of the Star, commonly attributed to king John.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ROBERT of France,</span><span class="font1"> ſecond ſon of Louis VIII. and brother to St Louis, who erected in his favour Artois&nbsp;into a royal peerage in the year 1 237. It was during&nbsp;this time that the unlucky difference between pope Gregory IX. and the emperor Frederic II. took place.&nbsp;Gregory offered to St Louis the empire for Robert ;&nbsp;but the French nobleſſe, having met to deliberate on&nbsp;this propoſal, were of opinion that he ought to reject&nbsp;it. He gave the pope for anſwer : “ That Count&nbsp;Robert eſteemed himſelf ſufficiently honoured by being&nbsp;the brother of a king, who ſurpaſſed in dignity, in</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">ſtrength, in wealth, and in birth, all other monarch<sup>1</sup>: in the world.” Robert accompanied St Louis into&nbsp;Egypt, and fought with more bravery than prudence&nbsp;at the battle of Maſſourc, on the 9th of February 12 ;o.&nbsp;In his purſuit of the cowards through a certain ſmall&nbsp;village, he was killed by ſtones, ſticks, and other things&nbsp;which they threw at him from the windows. He was&nbsp;an intrepid prince, but too paſſionate, dogmatical, and&nbsp;quarrelſome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robert</span><span class="font1"> II. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Count of Artois,</span><span class="font1"> ſon of the preceding, </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">urnamed the G ood and the Noble, was at the expedition into Africa in 1270. He drove the rebels from&nbsp;Navarre in 1276. He brought a very powerful aſſiſt-ance to Charles I. king of Naples, of which kingdom&nbsp;he was regent during the captivity of Charles II. He&nbsp;defeated the Arragonians in Sicily in 1289, the Engliſh near Bayonne in 1296, and the Flemi.* at Fumes&nbsp;in 1298. But having in 1302 imprudently attempted&nbsp;to force theſe laſt, when encamped near Courtray, he received no leſs than 30 wounds ; and in that expedition&nbsp;loſt both his honour and his life. He was a brave, but&nbsp;paſſionate and fierce man, and good at nothing but pu-gililtic encounters. Mahaud his .daughter inherited&nbsp;the dukedom of Artois, and gave herſelf in marriage to&nbsp;Otho duke of Burgundy, by whom ſhe had two daughters, Jane wife of Philip the Long, and Blanche wife&nbsp;of Charles the Fair. Iu the mean time Philip, ſon of&nbsp;Robert II. had a ſon,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robep.t</span><span class="font1"> III. who diſputed the dukedom of Artois with Mahaud his aunt; but he loſt his fuit by two&nbsp;ſentences given in againſt him in 1302 and 1318. He&nbsp;wiſhed to revive the proceſs in 1329, under Philip of&nbsp;Valois, by means of pretended new titles, which were&nbsp;found to be falſe. Robert was condemned the third&nbsp;time, and baniſhed the kingdom in 133 1. Having&nbsp;found an aſylum with Edward III. king of England,&nbsp;he undertook to declare him king of France ; which&nbsp;proved the cauſe of thoſe long and cruel wars which&nbsp;diſtreſſed that kingdom. Robert was wounded at the&nbsp;ſiege of Vannes in 134.2, and died of his wound in England. John, ſon to Robert, and count of. Eu, was.&nbsp;taken priſoner at the battle of Poitiers in. 1356, and&nbsp;terminated his career in 1387. His ſon Philip If.&nbsp;high conſtable of France, carried on war in Africa and&nbsp;Hungary, and died in 1397, being a. priſoner of the&nbsp;Turks. He had a ſon named </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Charles,</span><span class="font1"> who died in 1472,&nbsp;leaving no iſſue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Robert of Anjou,</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">urnamed the Wiſe, third ſon of Charles the Lame, </span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ucceeded his father in the kingdom&nbsp;of Naples in 1309, by the protection of the popes, and&nbsp;the will of the people, to the excluſion of Charobert&nbsp;ſon of his eldeſt brother. He aided the Roman pontiffs againſt the emperor Henry VII. and, after the&nbsp;death of that prince, was nominated in 1313 vicar of&nbsp;the empire in Italy, in temporal matters, unleſs a new&nbsp;emperor was elected. This title was given him by&nbsp;Clement V. in virtue of a right which he pretended to&nbsp;have to govern the empire during an interregnum. Robert reigned with glory 33 years, eight months, and&nbsp;died on the 19th of January 1343, aged 64.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ This</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">prince (</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ays M. De Montigni) had not thoſe qualities which conſtitute heroes, but he had thoſe which make&nbsp;good kings. He was religious, affable, generous, kind,&nbsp;wiſe, prudent, and a zealous promoter of juſtice.” He&nbsp;was called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Solomon</span><span class="font1"> of his age. He loved the poor,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
