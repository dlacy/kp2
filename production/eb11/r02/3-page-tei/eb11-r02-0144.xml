It is applied more particularly to the investigations of those who devote themselves to the study of pure as opposed to applied science, to the investigation of causes rather than to practical experiment; thus while every surgeon or physician who treats an individual case of cancer may add to our sum of knowledge of the disease, the body of trained investigators which is endowed by the Cancer Research Fund are working on different lines. Again, the practical engineers who are building aeroplanes, and those who are making practical tests by actual flight in those machines, cannot be called “ researchers ”; that term should be confined to the members, for example, of the scientific committee appointed by the British Government in 1909 to make investigations regarding aerial construction and navigation. Further, the term is particularly used of a course of post-graduate study at a university, for which many universities have provided special Research Studentships or Fellowships. These act as endowments for a specific period, and are conditional on the holder devoting his time to the investigation at first hand of some specified subject.</p><p>RESENDE, ANDRÉ DE (1498-1573), the father of archaeology in Portugal, began life as a Dominican friar, but about 1540 passed over to the ranks of the secular clergy. He spent many years travelling in Spain, France and Belgium, where he corresponded with Erasmus and other learned men. He was also intimate with King John· III. and his sons, and acted as tutor to the Infante D. Duarte. Resende enjoyed considerable fame in his lifetime, but modern writers have shown that he is neither accurate nor scrupulous. In Portuguese he wrote:</p><p>(1)    <hi rend="italic">Historia da antiguidade da cidade de Evora (ibid.</hi>  1553);</p><p>(2)    <hi rend="italic">Vida do Infante D.</hi>  DwarZe/Lisbon, 1789). His chief Latin work is the <hi rend="italic">De Antiquitatibus Lusitaniae</hi>  (Evora, 1593).</p><p>See the “ Life ” of Resende in Farinha’s <hi rend="italic">Collecçao das antiguidade s de Evora</hi>  (1785), and a biographieal-eritical article by Rivara in the <hi rend="italic">Revista Litteraria.</hi>  (Oporto, 1839), iii. 340-62; also Cleynarts, <hi rend="italic">Latin Letters.</hi>    (E. <hi rend="smallcaps">Pr.)</hi></p><p>RESENDE, GARCIA DE (1470-1536), Portuguese poet and editor, was born at Evora, and began to serve John II. as a page at the age of ten, becoming' his private secretary in 1491. He was present at his death at Alvor on the 25th of October 1495. He continued to enjoy the same favour with King Manoel, whom he accompanied to Castile in 1498, and from whom he obtained a knighthood of the Order of Christ. In 1514 Resende went to Rome with Tristao da Cunha, as secretary and treasurer of the famous embassy sent by the king to offer the tribute of the East at the feet of Pope Leo X. In 1516 he was given the rank of a nobleman of the royal household, and became <hi rend="italic">escriväo de fazenda </hi>to Prince John, afterwards King John III., from whom he received further pensions in 1525. Resende built a chapel in the monastery of Espinhciro near Evora, the pantheon of the Alemtejo nobility, where he was buried.</p><p>He began to cultivate the making of verses in the palace of John II., and he tells us how one night when the king was in bed he caused him (Resende) to repeat some “ trovas ” of Jorge Manrique, saying it was as needful for a man to know them as to know the Pater Noster. Under these conditions, Resende grew up no mean poet, and moreover distinguished himself by his skill in drawing and music; while he collected into an album the best court verse of the time. The <hi rend="italic">Cancioneiro Geral,</hi>  probably begun in 1483 though not printed until 1516, includes the compositions of some three hundred <hi rend="italic">fidalgos</hi>  of the reigns of kings Alphonso V., John II. and ManoeL The main subjects of its pieces are love, satire and epigram, and most of them are written in the national redondilha yerse, but the metre is irregular and the rhyming careless. The Spanish language is largely employed, because the Uterary progenitors of the whole collection were Juan de Mena, Jorge Manrique, Boscan and Garcilasso. As a rule the compositions were improvised at palace entertainments, at which the poets present divided into two bands, attacking and defending a given theme throughout successive evenings. At other times these poetical soirées took the form of a mock trial at law, in which the queen of John II. acted as judge.</p><p>Resende was much twitted by other rhymesters on his corpulence, but he repaid all their gibes with interest.</p><p>The artistic value of the <hi rend="italic">Cancioneiro Geral</hi>  is slight. Conventional in tone, the greater part are imitations of Spanish poets and show no trace of inspiration in their authors. The <hi rend="italic">Cancioneiro</hi>  is redeemed from complete insipidity by Rcsende himself, and his fine verses on the death of D. Ignez de Castro inspired the great episode in the <hi rend="italic">Lusiads</hi>  of Camoens <hi rend="italic">(q.v.). </hi>Resende is the compiler of a gossiping chronicle of his patron John II., which, though plagiarized from the chronicle by Ruy de Pina <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi>  has a value of its own. The past lives again in these pages, and though Resende’s anecdotes may be unimportant in themselves, they reveal much of the inner fife of the 15th century. Resende’s <hi rend="italic">Miscellanea,</hi>  a rhymed commentary on the most notable events of his time, which is annexed to his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle,</hi>  is a document full of historical interest, and as a poem not without merit. The editions of his <hi rend="italic">Chronicle</hi>  are those of IS45, 1554, 1596, 1607, 1622, 1752 and 1798.</p><p>IIis <hi rend="italic">Cancioneiro</hi>  appeared in 1516, and was reprinted by Kausler at Stuttgart in 3 vols., 1846-52.

There are some technical uses of the term. In English law “ reservation ” is used of the retention by the vendor or lessor, in a conveyance or lease, of some right or interest, which without such reservation would have passed to the purchaser or tenant; such “ reservations ” usually are concerned with rights of way or other easements or sporting rights. In ecclesiastical usage, the term is applied to the practice of preserving unconsumed a portion of the consecrated elements after the celebration of the Eucharist. For the history of this practice and its usage in the Roman, Greek and English churches, see Eucharist,§ <hi rend="italic">-Reservation of the Eucharist.</hi>  In the Roman Church, where the pope retains for himself the right to nominate to certain benefices, that action is termed, technically, “ reservation.” When in making a statement, taking an oath, &amp;c., a person qualifies that statement in his mind, or withholds some fact, word or expression which, if expressed, would materially alter the effect of his statement or oath, such qualification is termed a “ mental reservation,” or, in the technical language of casuistry, “ mental restriction ” (see Liguori). The system of providing special tracts of land exclusively for the tribes of American Indians, adopted in the United States of America and in Canada, is known as the Reservation system, and such tracts are styled Indian Reservations. (See United States and Canada.)</p><p>RESHT, the capital of the province of Gilan in Persia, in 37° 17' N., and 49° 36' E., on the left bank of the Siah-rud (Black river), which is a branch of the Sefid-rud (White river), and flows into the Murdab, lagoon of Enzeli. The distance from Enzeli, the port of disembarcation from Russia, on the S. shore of thc Caspian, to Resht is 14 m. in a direct line, and is accomplished in an open boat, or (since 1892), depth of water permitting, in a small steamboat to Pir-i-Bazar and thence 6 m. on a good road by carriage. Resht has a population of 60,000 and is the residence of English, Russian, French and Turkish consuls and the seat of the governor-general of the province of Gilan. The town is situated in low, malarious ground, and was originally buried in jungle, but the Rhssians during their occupation of the place in 1723-34 cleared much timber and jungle and made some open spaces. The houses are red-tiled and raised from the ground, with broad verandahs and overhanging eaves. Conflagrations arc frequent, particularly in the months of January and December, when hot, dry winds resembling the Föhn of the Alps come down from the snow-capped Elburz.
