<p><span class="font0">ſtrands, and the ſtrength of the ſtrands is to that of the rope as the length of the firſt to that of the laſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And thus we ſee that twiſting the fibres diminiſhes the ſtrength of the aſſemblage ; becauſe their obliquity,&nbsp;which is its neceſſary conſequence, enables any external&nbsp;force to excite a greater ſtrain on the fibres than it&nbsp;could have excited had they remained parallel ; and&nbsp;finee a greater degree of twiſting neceſſarily produces a&nbsp;greater obliquity, of the fibres, it muſt more remarkably&nbsp;diminiſh the ſtrength of the cord. Moreover, ſince the&nbsp;greater obliquity cannot be produced without a greater&nbsp;ſtrain in the operation of twiſting, it follows, that immoderate twiſting is doubly prejudicial to the ſtrength&nbsp;of cordage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Theſe theoretical deductions are abundantly confirmed by experiment ; and as many perſons give their aſ-ſent more readily to a general propofιtion when preſent-ed as an induction from unexceptionable particulars, than when offered as the conſequence of uncontroverted&nbsp;principles, we ſhall mention ſome of the experiments&nbsp;which have been made on this ſubject. Mr Reaumur,&nbsp;one of the moſt zealous, and at the ſame time judicious,&nbsp;obſervers of nature made the following experiments.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Mem. Acad. Pans,</span><span class="font1"> τ 7 I I. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">A thread, conſiſting of 832 fibres of filk, each of&nbsp;which carried at a medium 1 dram and 18 grains, would&nbsp;hardly ſupport y⅛ pounds, and ſometimes broke with&nbsp;5 pounds. The film of the abſolute ſtrengths of the&nbsp;fibres is 1040 drams, or upwards of 8 pounds 2 ounces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ſkain of white thread was examined in many&nbsp;places. Every part of it bore q&lt; pounds, but none of&nbsp;it would bear 10. When twiſted ſlack into a cord of&nbsp;2 yarns it broke with 16 pounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three threads were twiſted together. Their mean&nbsp;ſtrength was very nearly 8 pounds. It broke with 17⅜,&nbsp;whereas it ſhould have carried 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Four threads were twiſted. Their mean ſtrength&nbsp;was 7I. Tt broke with 21 ſ inſtead of 30. Four threads,&nbsp;whoſe ſtrength was nearly 9 pounds, broke with 22 inſtead of 36.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A ſmall and very well made hempen cord broke&nbsp;in different places with’58, 63, 67, 72 pounds. Another part of it was untwiſted into its three ſtrands.&nbsp;One of them bore 29⅜, another 33⅜, and the third 35;&nbsp;therefore the ſum of their abſolute ſtrengths was 98.&nbsp;In another part which broke with 72, the ſtrands&nbsp;which had already borne this ſtrain were ſeparated.&nbsp;They bore 26, 28, and 30; the ſum of which is 84.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The late admiral Sir Charles Knowles made many experiments on cordage of fize. A piece of rope&nbsp;.3J inches in circumference was cut into many portions. Each of theſe had a fathom cut off, and it&nbsp;was carefully opened out. It was white, or untarred, and containd 72 yarns. They were each tried&nbsp;ſeparately, and their mean ſtrength was 90 pounds. Each&nbsp;correſponding piece of rope was tried apart, and the&nbsp;mean ſtrength of the nine pieces was 4552 pounds.&nbsp;But 90 times 72 is 6480.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nothing is more familiarly known to a ſeaman than the ſuperior ſtrength of rope-yarns made up into a ſkain&nbsp;without twiſting. They call ſuch a piece of rope a&nbsp;Salvage. It is uſed on board the king’s ſhips for&nbsp;rolling tackles, flinging the great guns, butt-flings,&nbsp;nippers for holding the viol on the cable, and in every</span></p><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">ſervice where the utmoſt ſtrength and great pliancy are wanted.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">It is therefore fufficiently eſtabliſhed, both by theory and obſervation, that the twiſting of cordage diminiſhes&nbsp;its ſtrength. Experiments cannot be made with ſuſſi-cient precifion for determining whether this diminution&nbsp;is in the very proportion, relative to the obliquity of&nbsp;the fibres, which theory points out. In a hawſer the&nbsp;yarns lie in a great variety of angles with the axis. The&nbsp;very outermoſt yarn of a ſtrand is not much inclined to&nbsp;the axis of the rope : for the inclination of this yarn&nbsp;to the axis of its own ſtrand nearly compenſates for&nbsp;the inclination of the ſtrand. But then the oppoſite&nbsp;yarn of the ſame ſtrand, the yarn that is next the axis&nbsp;of the rope lies with an obliquity, which is the ſum of&nbsp;the obliquities of the ſtrand and of the yarn. So that&nbsp;all the yarns which are really in the axis of the rope&nbsp;are exceedingly oblique, and, in general, the infide of&nbsp;the rope has its yarns more oblique than the outlide.&nbsp;But in a laid rope we ſhould not conſider the ſtrength&nbsp;as made up of the ſtrengths of the yarns ; it is made&nbsp;up of the ſtrengths of the ſtrands : For when the rope is&nbsp;violently ſtretched, it untwiſts as a rope, and the ſtrands&nbsp;are a little more twiſted ; fo that they are refiſting as&nbsp;ſtrands, and not as yarns. Indeed, when we conſider&nbsp;the proceſs of laying the rope, we ſee that it muſt be ſo.&nbsp;We know, from what has been already ſaid, that the&nbsp;three ſtrands would carry more when parallel than when&nbsp;twiſted into a rope, although the yarns would then be&nbsp;much more oblique to the axis. The chief attention&nbsp;therefore ſhould be turned to the making the moſt perfect ſtrands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are fully authoriſed to ſay that the twiſt given to cordage ſhould be as moderate as poſſible. We are&nbsp;certain that it diminiſhes the ſtrength, and that the appearance of ſtrength which its ſuperior ſmoothneſs and&nbsp;hardneſs gives is ſallaeious. But a certain degree of&nbsp;this is neceſſary for its duration. If the rope is laid too&nbsp;ſlack, its parts are apt to open when it happens to be&nbsp;catched in ſhort loops at its going into a pulley, &amp;c. in&nbsp;which caſe ſome of the ſtrands or yarns are apt to kink&nbsp;and break. It alſo becomes too pervious to water,&nbsp;which ſoaks and rots it. To prevent theſe and other&nbsp;ſuch inconveniences, a conſiderable degree of ſirmneſs&nbsp;or hardneſs is neceſſary ; and in order to give the&nbsp;cordage this appearance of ſuperior ſtrength, the manufacturer is diſpoſed to exceed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr Du Hamel made many experiments in the royal dock-yards in France, with a view to aſcertain λvhat is&nbsp;the beſt degree of twiſt. It is uſual to work up the&nbsp;yams to -∣∙ of their length. Mr Du Hamel thought&nbsp;this too much, and procured ſome to be worked up&nbsp;only to ⅜ of the length of the yarns. The ſtrength&nbsp;of the firſt, by a mean of three experiments, was 4321,&nbsp;and that of the laſt was 5187.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He cauſed three ropes to be made from the ſame hemp, ſpun with all poſſible equability, and in ſuch&nbsp;proportion of yarn that a fathom of each was of the&nbsp;ſame weight. The rope which was worked up to γ&nbsp;bore 4098 pounds ; that which was worked up to J&nbsp;bore 4850; and the one worked up to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font0"> bore 6205.&nbsp;In another trial the ſtrengths were 425<sup>t</sup>0, 6753, and&nbsp;7397. Theſe ropes were of different ſizes.</span></p><h2><span class="font0">He had influence enough, in conſequence of theſe </span><span class="font1">experiments, to get a conſiderable quantity of rigging</span></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
