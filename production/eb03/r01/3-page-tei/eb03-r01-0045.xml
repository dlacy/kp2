The magiſtrates and officers of thc city are all Proteſtants ; and it is to be remarked, that although there are about 2 2 Catholic churches, yet there are very few Catholic citizens, the magiſtracy not allowing the freedom of the town to be given to Catholics living there. As this city is large,.elegant, and full of magnificent houſes,-it has been choſen many years for the place of holding the diet, upon account of the conveniency, to many neighbouring princes and ſtates, of ι<hi rend="sup">f</hi>ending their provi-ſions by land and water,■ without great expence. The town-houſe, in the hall of which the Diet meets, is extremely magnificent. In the year 1740, however, when there was a war in Germany, the Diet met at Frankfort on the Main, till after the death of the emperor Charles VII. Proviſions are very plentiful at Ratiſhon in time of peace. The inhabitants have a good deal of trade, the river on which it ſtands being navigable, and communicating with a great part of Germany. lt is 55 miles ſouth-eaſt of Nuremberg, 62 north of Munich, and 1 95 weſt of vienna.

The Duke of Lawenburg ſeized and fortified it in 1689, and the king of Denmark took it in 1693 ; but it was diſmantled, and reſtored in 1 700 to the Duke, who re-fortified it. This town has been frequently pillaged, particularly in 1552, by Francis duke of Saxe Lawenburg, becaufe the canons retufed to elect his ſon Magnus their biſhop. It lies nine miles ſouth of Lubec.

The houſes were all of wood, the communication by bridges and boats, and the town kept fweet and clean by the tides carrying away the mud and foil, (Strabo). Anciently it had a port at the mouth of the Bedeſis ; Auguſtus added a new port, capacious to hold a fleet, for the ſecurity of the Adriatic, between which and the city lay the via Cæfaris. In the lower age it was the ſeat of the oſtrogoths for 72 years ; but being recovered by Narſes, Juſtinian’s general, it became<hi rend="sub">i</hi>the reſidence of the exarchs, magiſtrates ſent by the emperor from Conſtantinople, for 175 years, when it was taken by the Longobards. It is ſtill called<hi rend="italic">Ravenna,</hi>  capital of Romania. The ſeat of the weſtern or Roman Empire was by Honorius tranſlated to Ravenna about the year 404, and hence the country in which it ſtood was called <hi rend="italic">Romania,</hi>  in the pope’s territory. It had a very flouriſhing trade till the ſea withdrew two miles from it, which has been a great detriment. The fortifica-tions are of little importance, and the citadel is gone to ruin. It is now moſt remarkable for the excellent wine produced in its neighbourhood. The mauſoleum of Theodoric is ſtill to be ſeen, remarkable for being covered by a ſingle ſtone 28 feet in diameter and 15 thick.
