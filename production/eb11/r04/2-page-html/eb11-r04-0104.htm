<p><span class="font0">abolition of the monarchy brought with It a change of the utmost importance in the actual working of the constitution.&nbsp;Though the distinction between patricians and plebeians was&nbsp;at least as old as the state itself, it is not until the establishment of the Republic that it plays any part in the history of&nbsp;Rome. No sooner, however, was the overshadowing authority&nbsp;of the king removed than a struggle commenced between&nbsp;the two orders which lasted for more than two centuries.&nbsp;It was in no sense a struggle between a conquering and a&nbsp;conquered class, or between an exclusive citizen body and an&nbsp;unenfranchised mass outside its pale. Patricians and plebeians&nbsp;were equally citizens of Rome, sprung of the same race and&nbsp;speaking the same tongue (but see above).<sup>@@1 </sup>The former&nbsp;were the members of those ancient </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">genles</span><span class="font0"> which had possibly&nbsp;been once the “ chiefly ” families in the small communities&nbsp;which preceded the united state, and which claimed by hereditary&nbsp;right a privileged position in the community. Only patricians&nbsp;could sit in the council of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patres,</span><span class="font0"> and hence probably the name&nbsp;given to their order.<sup>@@2</sup> To their representatives the supreme&nbsp;authority reverted on the death of the king; the due transmission of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">anspicia</span><span class="font0"> and the public worship of the state&nbsp;gods were their special care; and to them alone were known&nbsp;the traditional usages and forms which regulated the life of&nbsp;the people from day to day. To the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font0"> (the multitude,&nbsp;irXijOos) belonged all who were not members of some patrician&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens,</span><span class="font0"> whether independent freemen or attached as “clients’<sup>@@3&nbsp;</sup>to one of the great houses. The plebeian was a citizen, with&nbsp;civil rights and a vote in the assembly of the curies, but he was&nbsp;excluded by ancient custom from all share in the higher honours&nbsp;of the state, and intermarriage with a patrician was not recognized as a properly legal union<sup>@@4</sup> (see Patricians).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The revolution which expelled the Tarquins gave the patricians, who had mainly assisted in bringing it about, an&nbsp;overwhelming ascendancy in the state. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font0"> had indeed&nbsp;gained something. Not only is it probable that the strictness&nbsp;of the old tie of clientship had somewhat relaxed, and that&nbsp;the number of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">clientes</span><span class="font0"> was smaller and their dependence&nbsp;on patrician patrons less complete, but the ranks of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">had, under the later kings, been swelled by the admission of&nbsp;conquered Latins, and the freeholders among these had with&nbsp;others been enrolled in the Servian tribes, classes and centuries.&nbsp;The establishment of the Republic invested this military levy&nbsp;of landholders with political rights as an assembly, for by their&nbsp;votes the consuls were chosen and laws passed, and it was the&nbsp;plebeian landholders who formed the main strength of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font0"> in the struggle that followed. But these gains were&nbsp;greater in appearance than in reality. The plebeian landholders commanded only a minority of votes in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comitia&nbsp;cenluriata.</span><span class="font0"> In their choice of magistrates they were limited&nbsp;to the patrician candidates nominated by patrician presiding&nbsp;magistrates, and their choice required confirmation not only&nbsp;by the older and smaller assembly of the curiae, in which the&nbsp;patricians and their clients predominated, but also by the&nbsp;patrician </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patres.</span><span class="font0"> They could only vote on laws proposed by&nbsp;patrician consuls, and here again the subsequent sanction of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patres</span><span class="font0"> Was necessary. The whole procedure of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comitia&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">was in short absolutely in the hands of their patrician presidents, and liable to every sort of interruption and suspension&nbsp;from patrician pontiffs and augurs (for details see further&nbsp;Comitia and Senate).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But these political disabilities did not constitute the main grievance of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font0"> in the early years of the Republic.&nbsp;What they fought for was protection for their lives and liberties,&nbsp;and the object of attack was the despotic authority, of the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">patrician magistrates. The consuls wielded the full </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperium</span><span class="font0"> of the kings, and against this “ consular authority ** the plebeian,&nbsp;though a citizen, had no protection and no appeal, nor were&nbsp;matters improved when for the two consuls was substituted&nbsp;in some emergency a single, all-powerful, irresponsible&nbsp;dictator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The history of this struggle between the orders opens with a concession made to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font0"> by one of the consuls themselves,&nbsp;a concession possibly due to a desire to secure the&nbsp;allegiance of the plebeian landholders, who formed&nbsp;the backbone of the army. In the first year of&nbsp;the Republic, according to the received chronology,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">P. Valerius Publicóla or Poplicola carried in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comitia centuriata </span><span class="font0">his famous law of appeal.<sup>@@5</sup> It enacted that no magistrate,&nbsp;saving only a dictator, should execute a capital sentence upon&nbsp;any Roman citizen unless the sentence had been confirmed on&nbsp;appeal by the assembly of the centuries. But, though the&nbsp;“ right of appeal ” granted by this law was justly regarded&nbsp;in later times as the greatest safeguard of a Roman’s liberties,&nbsp;it was by no- means at first so effective a protection as it afterwards became. For not only was the operation of the law&nbsp;limited to the bounds of the city, so that the consul in the field&nbsp;or on the march was left as absolute as before, but no security&nbsp;was provided for its observance even within the city by consuls&nbsp;resolved to disregard it.<sup>@@6</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was by their own efforts that the plebeians first obtained any real protection against magisterial despotism. The traditional accounts of the first secession are confused&nbsp;and contradictory,<sup>@@7</sup> but its causes and results are&nbsp;tolerably clear. The seceders were the plebeian&nbsp;legionaries recently returned from a victorious campaign. Indignant at the delay of the promised reforms, they&nbsp;ignored the order given them to march afresh against Volsci&nbsp;and Aequi, and instead entrenched themselves on a hill across&nbsp;the Anio, some 3 m. from Rome, and known afterwards as&nbsp;the Mons Sacer. The frightened patricians came to terms,&nbsp;and a solemn agreement </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{lex sacrata)<sup>@@8 </sup></span><span class="font0">was concluded between&nbsp;the orders, by which it was provided that henceforth the&nbsp;plebeians should have annual magistrates of their own called&nbsp;tribunes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(tribuni plebis),</span><span class="font0"> members of their own order, who&nbsp;should be authorized to protect them against the consuls,<sup>@@9</sup> and&nbsp;a curse was invoked upon the man who should injure or impede&nbsp;the tribune in the performance of his duties.<sup>@@10</sup> The number of&nbsp;tribunes was possibly at first two, then five; before 449 b.c. it&nbsp;had been raised to ten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tribunate is an institution which has no parallel in history. The tribune was not, and, strictly speaking, never became, a&nbsp;magistrate of the Roman people. His one proper prerogative&nbsp;was that of granting protection to the oppressed plebeian against&nbsp;a patrician officer. This prerogative </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(jus auxilii)</span><span class="font0"> was secured&nbsp;to him, not by the ordinary constitution, but by a special&nbsp;compact between the orders, and was protected by the ancient&nbsp;oath </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(veins jusjurandum),<sup>@@11</sup> </span><span class="font0">which invoked a curse upon the&nbsp;violator of a tribune. This exceptional and anomalous right&nbsp;the tribunes could only exercise in person, within the limits of&nbsp;the “ pomoerium,” and against individual acts of magisterial&nbsp;oppression.<sup>@@12 </sup>It was only gradually that it expanded into a wide&nbsp;power of interference with the whole machinery of government,&nbsp;and was supplemented by the legislative powers which rendered the tribunate of the last century b.c. so formidable (see&nbsp;Tribune).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But from the first the tribunes were for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font0"> not only protectors but leaders, under whom they organized themselves&nbsp;in opposition to the patricians. The tribunes convened&nbsp;assemblies of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs (concilia plebis),</span><span class="font0"> and carried&nbsp;resolutions on questions of interest to the order.
