, a circle of the kingdom of Bavaria, formed out of the ancient Southern Franconia, in the principality of Ans-pach, out of Bavarian Unterland, and the territories of the former free states of Nuremberg, Rottenburg, Windsheim, and Weissenbourg. It extends over 3052 square miles, and is bounded on the north-west by the circle of the Lower Maine, and on the north-east by that of the Upper Maine, on the east by that of the Regen, on the south by that of the Upper Maine, and on the west by the territory of the kingdom of Wirtemberg. The circle is divided into forty-one bailiwicks, which comprehend forty-two cities or towns once walled, fifty-five market-towns, and 2004 villages, with 530,726 inhabitants, of whom the far greater part are Lutherans, and most of the rest still adhere to the Catholic church. It is generally a level or undulating district, whose waters are partly conveyed by the smaller rivers to the Danube, but the greater portion by the Maine to the Rhine. It is the best cultivated, the most populous, and the most productive division of the kingdom. It yields abundance of corn and cattle, some wine, and all the various kinds of common fruits. Its manufactures also are extensive, especially near Nuremberg, but having little water communication, the chief commodities are conveyed by land-carriage.</p>
