<p><span class="font0">ment was not very parliamentary. He convoked the councils as seldom as was possible, although he frequently&nbsp;assembled the people in parliament. The chief complaint&nbsp;made against him was of undue severity in the administration of justice. He rendered the clergy amenable to secular&nbsp;tribunals, subdued the neighbouring cities of Tivoli,&nbsp;Palestrina, &lt;fec., and commanded in person the attacking&nbsp;force. But his greatest energy was directed to the&nbsp;repression of the more turbulent nobles who were opposed&nbsp;to him; and he soon made them feel the weight of his hand&nbsp;by hanging some, banishing others, and persecuting several&nbsp;more. But he too recognized the expediency of winning the&nbsp;popular favour. He was the first senator to add to his&nbsp;title that of captain of the people (“ Almae Urbis Senator&nbsp;Ill : et Romani Populi Capitaneus ”). He befriended the&nbsp;people by promoting the organization of guilds after the&nbsp;manner of those of his native Bologna. There were already&nbsp;a few in Rome, such as the merchants’ guild and that of the&nbsp;agriculturists, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bobacteriorum</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bovattari,</span><span class="font0"> who must have&nbsp;resembled the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mercαnti di campagna</span><span class="font0"> or graziers of&nbsp;the present day, since no peasant guild existed in Italian&nbsp;republics. The merchants’ guild, definitely established in&nbsp;1255 under Brancaleone’s rule, had four consuls and twelve&nbsp;councillors, held meetings, and made laws. The other&nbsp;guilds, thirteen in all, were organized much on the same&nbsp;plan. The admission of their heads into the councils of&nbsp;the republic in 1267 shows how efficaciously their interests&nbsp;had been promoted by Brancaleone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The death of Innocent IV. and the election of Alexander</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">IV. (1254-61), who was milder and less shrewd than his&nbsp;predecessor, were favourable events for Brancaleone ; but&nbsp;he failed to check the growing discontent of the clergy&nbsp;and the more powerful nobles, who had received deadly&nbsp;injuries at his hands. And when, on the expiration of his&nbsp;three years’ term of office, his re-election was proposed, his&nbsp;enemies rose against him, accused him before the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sindαcato,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">threw him into prison, and vehemently protested against&nbsp;the continuance of “foreign tyranny.” His life was only&nbsp;spared on account of the hostages sent to Bologna. The&nbsp;next senator chosen was a Brescian Guelf, Emanuele de&nbsp;Madio, a tool of the nobles,- who were now masters of the&nbsp;situation. But soon afterwards, in 1257, the guilds rose&nbsp;in revolt, drove the nobles from power, put the pope to&nbsp;flight, and recalled Brancaleone for another three years’&nbsp;term. He ruled more sternly than before, hung several&nbsp;nobles, and made alliance with Manfred, the representative&nbsp;of the Swabian party in Italy. This rendered him&nbsp;increasingly odious to the pope and procured his excommunication. But, disregarding the thunders of the church,&nbsp;he marched against Anagni, the pope’s birthplace, and&nbsp;Alexander was quickly obliged to humiliate himself before&nbsp;the senator of Rome. Brancaleone next set to work to&nbsp;destroy the fortified towers of the nobility, and in razing&nbsp;them to the ground ruined many of the adjacent dwellings. Accordingly, a considerable number of nobles became&nbsp;homeless exiles. In 1258, while engaged on the siege of&nbsp;Corneto, Brancaleone was attacked by a violent fever, and,&nbsp;being carried back to Rome, died on the Capitoline Hill.&nbsp;Thus ended the career of a truly remarkable statesman.&nbsp;He was succeeded by his uncle, Castellano degli Andalo,&nbsp;who, lacking the political genius of his nephew, only&nbsp;retained office until the following spring (1259), in the&nbsp;midst of fierce and perpetual disturbances. Then the&nbsp;people, being bribed by the pope, joined with the nobles&nbsp;and drove him away. His life too was saved by having&nbsp;followed his nephew’s shrewd plan of sending hostages to&nbsp;Bologna. Two senators of Roman birth were next elected ;&nbsp;and on the death of Alexander IV. a French pope was&nbsp;chosen, Urban IV. (1261-64), thus giving fresh predominance in the church to the anti-Swabian policy. But the&nbsp;internal disturbances of the city soon drove Urban to&nbsp;flight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this period the fall of the empire had induced many Italian republics to seek strength by placing their&nbsp;governments in the hands of some prince willing to swear&nbsp;respect to their laws and to undertake their defence against&nbsp;neighbouring states and the pope. In Rome the Guelfs&nbsp;and Ghibellines proposed various candidates for this office,&nbsp;and after many fierce quarrels ended by electing a committee of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">boni homines,</span><span class="font0"> charged with the revision of the&nbsp;statutes, reorganization of the city, and choice of a senator.&nbsp;This committee sat for more than a year without nominating any one, so, the Guelf party being now predominant,&nbsp;and all being wearied of this provisional state of things,&nbsp;the majority agreed on the election as senator of Charles&nbsp;of Anjou, who, at the pope’s summons, was already preparing for the conquest of Naples. He would defend&nbsp;Rome against the pope, and the pope would defend Rome&nbsp;against him. By thus taking advantage of either’s&nbsp;jealousy the citizens hoped to keep their republic intact.&nbsp;In fact, although Urban IV. had incited Charles to attack&nbsp;Naples, he was by no means willing to see him established&nbsp;as master in Rome. He accordingly declared that, if&nbsp;Charles really wished to obtain the Neapolitan crown, he&nbsp;must only accept the offered dignity pending the conquest&nbsp;of that kingdom. And he must likewise promise to&nbsp;recognize the supremacy of the pope over the senate.&nbsp;Charles soothed him with the amplest verbal promises,&nbsp;but in fact accepted the senatorship for life. In 1265,&nbsp;when Urban was succeeded by Clement IV. (1265-68),&nbsp;who as a Provençal was a subject of Charles, the latter&nbsp;entered Rome and was immediately made senator. Seven&nbsp;days later (28th June) he received the investiture of the&nbsp;Neapolitan kingdom, and in the following January its&nbsp;crown. On the 26th February 1266 the battle of&nbsp;Benevento was fought, and, the valiant Manfred being&nbsp;killed, the triumph of the Guelf Angevins in Italy was&nbsp;assured. Then, at the urgent command of the pope,&nbsp;Charles was forced to resign the senatorship in the May of&nbsp;the same year. Two Romans were elected in his stead, but&nbsp;soon fell out with the pope, because the Guelf nobles again&nbsp;tried to exercise tyranny. The people, however, profited by&nbsp;these disturbances to rise on its own account, and formed&nbsp;a democratic government of twenty-six boni homines with&nbsp;Angelo Capocci, a Ghibelline, as its captain. By this&nbsp;government Don Henry, son of Ferdinand III. of Castile,&nbsp;was elected senator ; and he came to Rome for the purpose&nbsp;of promoting a Ghibelline and Swabian policy in favour '&nbsp;of Conradin, who was preparing for conflict. The rule of&nbsp;the new senator was very energetic, for he kept down the&nbsp;clergy, subdued the Campagna, persecuted the Guelf&nbsp;nobles, made alliance with the Tuscan Ghibellines, forcibly&nbsp;drove back the troops of King Charles, who was advancing&nbsp;towards Rome, and gave a splendid reception to Conradin.&nbsp;But the battle of Tagliacozzo (23rd August 1268), followed&nbsp;by the murder of Conradin, proved fatal to the Ghibelline&nbsp;party. Charles was re-elected senator immediately after&nbsp;the battle, and the pope confirmed his powers for a term&nbsp;of ten years, after having already named him imperial&nbsp;vicar in Tuscany. On the 16th September Charles for&nbsp;the second time took possession of the Capitol, and ruled&nbsp;Rome firmly by means of vice-governors or vicars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Swabian line was now extinct, and in Charles’s hands the Neapolitan kingdom had become a fief of the&nbsp;church. The empire had fallen so low as to be no longer&nbsp;formidable. Now therefore was the moment for treating&nbsp;with it in order to restrain Charles, and also for making&nbsp;use of the French king to keep the empire in check. And&nbsp;this was the policy of Nicholas III. (1277-80), who&nbsp;hastened to extract advantageous promises from Rudolph</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
