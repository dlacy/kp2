In 1175 he again appears as a negotiator between the king and a number of English religious houses. The interest which Hoveden shows in ecclesiastical affairs and miracles may justify the supposition that he was <hi rend="bold">a </hi>clerk in orders. This, however, did not prevent him from acting, in 1189, as a justice of the forests in the shires of Yorkshire, Cumberland and Northumberland. After the death of Henry II., it would seem that Hoveden retired from the public service, though not so completely as to prevent him from drawing on the royal archives for the history of contemporary events. About the year 1192 he began to compile his <hi rend="italic">Chronica,</hi>  a gencral history of England from 732 to his own time. Up to the year 1192 his narrative adds little to our knowledge. For the period 732-1148 he chiefly drew upon an extant, but unpublished chronicle, the <hi rend="italic">Historia Saxonum sive Anglorum post obilum Bedae</hi>  (British Museum MS. Reg. 13 A. 6), which was composed about 1150. From 1148 to 1170 he used the Melrose Chronicle (edited for the Bannatyne Club in 1835 by Joseph Stevenson) and a collection of letters bearing upon the Becket controversy. From 1170-to 1192 his authority is the chronicle ascribed to Benedictus Abbas <hi rend="italic">(q.v.),</hi>  the author of which must have been in tbe royal household at about the same time as Hoveden. Although this period was one in which Hoveden had many opportunities of making independent observations, he adds little to the text which he uses; except that he inserts some additional documents. Either his predecessor had exhausted the royal archives, or the supplementary searches of Hoveden were languidly pursued. From 1192, however, Hoveden is an independent and copious authority. Like “ Benedictus,” he is sedulously impersonal, and makes no pretence to literary style, quotes documents in full and adheres to the annalistic method. His chronology is tolerably exact, but there are mistakes enough to prove that he recorded events at a certain distance of time. Both on foreign affairs and on questions of domestic policy he is unusually well informed. His practical experience as an administrator and his official connexions stood him in good stead. He is particularly useful on points of constitutional history. His work breaks off abruptly in 1201, though he certainly intended to carry it further. Probably his death should be placed in that year.</p><p>See W. Stubbs’s edition of the <hi rend="italic">Chronica</hi>  (Rolls Series) and the introductions to vols. i. and iv. This edition supersedes that of Sir H. Savile in his <hi rend="italic">Scriptores post Bedam</hi>  (1596).    (H. W. C. D.)</p><p>ROGER OF WENDOVER (d. 1236), English chronicler, was probably a native of Wendover in Buckinghamshire. At some uncertain date he became a monk of St Albans; afterwards he was appointed prior of the cell of Belvoir, but he forfeited this dignity in the early years of Henry III., having been found guilty of wasting the endowments. His latter years were passed at St Albans, where he died on the 6th of May 1236. He is the first of the important chroniclers who worked in the scriptorium of this house. His great work, the <hi rend="italic">Flores Histonarum,</hi>  begins at the creation and extends to 1235. It is of original value from 1202. Some critics have supposcd, but on inconclusive evidence, that Wendover copied, up to 1189, an earlier compilation, the work of John de Cella, the twenty-first abbot of St Albans (1195-1214). Wendover’s work is known to us through one 13th-century manuscript in the Bodleian library (Douce MS. 207), a mutilated 14th-century copy in the British Museum (Cotton MS. Otho B. v.), and the edition prepared by Matthew Paris which forms the first part of that writer’s <hi rend="italic">Chronica Majora</hi>  (ed. H. R. Luard, Rolls Series, 7 vols.). The best edition of Wendover is that of H. O. Coxe (4 vols., London, 1841-42); there is another (from 1154) in the Rolls Series by H. G. Hewlett (3 vols., 1886-89). Wendover is a copious but inaccurate writer, less prejudiced but also less graphic than Matthew Paris. Where he is the sole authority for an event, he is to be used with caution.</p><p>See Luard’s prefaces to vols, i., ii., iii. and vii. of the <hi rend="italic">Chronica Majora;</hi>  and the <hi rend="italic">Monumenta Germaniae Historica.

D.)</p><p>ROGERS, HENRY (1806-1877), English Nonconformist divine, was born at St Albans on the 18th of October 1806, and was educated privately and by his father, a surgeon of considerable culture. Rogers was meant to follow his father’s profession, but the reading of John Howc turned him to theology, and after qualifying at Highbury College he accepted a call to the Congregational Church at Poole in 1829. In 1832 he was appointed lecturer in logic at Highbury, in 1836 professor of English at University College, London, and in 1839 professor of English, mathematics and mental philosophy at Spring HiII College, Birmingham. In 1836 appeared his <hi rend="italic">Life and Character of John Howe,</hi>  and in 1837 <hi rend="italic">The Christian Correspondent,</hi>  a collection of some 400 religious letters “ by eminent persons of both sexes.” His contributions to the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Review</hi>  began in 1839 and were collected in volume form in 1850, 1855 and 1874. His most famous book, <hi rend="italic">The Eclipse of Faith, or a Visit to a Religions Sceptic, </hi>was published anonymously in 1852 and went through six editions in three years. It drew a <hi rend="italic">Reply</hi>  from F. W. Newman, which Rogers answered in a <hi rend="italic">Defence</hi>  (1854). Two volumes of imaginary letters, <hi rend="italic">Selections from the Correspondence of R. E. H. Greyson</hi>  (an anagram for his own name), appeared in 1857 and show his style at its best. In 1858 he became principal and professor of theology at the Lancashire Independent College, where he edited the works of John Howe (6 vols., 1862-63) <hi rend="sup">anf</hi>I wrote for the<hi rend="italic">British Quarterly.</hi>  He retired in 1871, and died at Machynlleth, on the 21st of August 1877. Rogers was widely read, and as a Christian apologist carried on the traditions of the 18th century as illustrated by Butler.</p><p>See Memoir by Dr R. W. Dale, prefixed to the 8th edition of <hi rend="italic">The Supernatural Origin of the Bible Inferred from Itself</hi>  (the Congregational Lecture for 1873, delivered by Rogers).</p><p>ROGERS, HENRY DARWIN (1808-1866), American geologist, was born at Philadelphia on the ist of August 1808. At the age of twenty-one he was chosen professor of chemistry and natural philosophy at Dickinson College, Pennsylvania. After holding this post for three years, he went to Europe and took up the study of geology. Subsequently be was engaged for twenty-two years in the State surveys of Pennsylvania and New Jersey, his Reports on which were published during the years 1836-41. In 1842 he and his brother <hi rend="smallcaps">William Barton Rogers</hi>  (1805-1882), who had been similarly occupied in Virginia (his Reports w’ere published in 1838-41, and he wrote also on the connexion between thermal springs and anticlinal axes and faults), brought before the Association of American Geologists and Naturalists their conclusions on the physical structure of the Appalachian chain, and on the elevation of great mountain chains. The researches of H. D. Rogers were elaborated in his final <hi rend="italic">Report on Pennsylvania </hi>(1858), in which he included a general account of the geology of the United States and of the coal-fields of North America and Great Britain. In this important work he dealt aLo with the structure of the great coal-fields, the method of formation of the strata, and the changes in the character of the coal from the bituminous type to anthracite. In 1857 he was appointed professor of natural history and geology at Glasgow. One of his later essays (1861) was on the parallel roads of Lochaber (Glen Roy), the origin of which he attributed to a vast inundation. He died at Glasgow on the 29th of May 1866.</p><p>ROGERS, JAMES EDWIN THOROLD (1823-1890), English economist, was born at West Meon, Hampshire, in 1823. He was educated at King’s College, London, and Magdalen Hall, Oxford. After taking a first-class degree in 1846, he was ordained, and was for a few years a curate in Oxford. Subsequently, however, he resigned his orders. For some time the classics were tbe chief field of his activity. He devoted himself a good deal to classical and philosophical tuition in Oxford with success, and his publications included an edition of Aristotle’s <hi rend="italic">Ethics</hi>  (in 1865). Simultaneously wdth these occupations he had been diligently studying economics, with</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
