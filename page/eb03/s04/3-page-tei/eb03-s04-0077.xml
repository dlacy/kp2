Even the wandering Arabs of the deſert, who never had any friendly correſpondence with the Christians of Europe, have from time immemorial been ſerved by negro ſlaves. “ The Arab muſt be poor indeed (says M. Saugnier) not to have at leaſt one negro ſlave. His ſole occupation is the care of the herd. They are never employed in war, but they have it in their power to many. Their wives, who are captive negreſſes, do all the domeſtic work, and are roughly treated by the Arabian women, and by the Arabs themſelves. Their children are ſlaves like them, and put to all kinds of drudgery.” Surely no man whoſe judgement is not completely warped by prejudice, will pretend that thoſe roving tribes of ſavages,ſo remarkable for their independent ſpirit and attachment to ancient cuſtoms, learned to enſlave the negroes from the Europeans. In all probability they have, without interruption, continued the practice of ſlavery from the days of their great anceſtor Iſhmael ; and it ſeems evident, that <hi rend="italic">none of the European nations had ever ſeen a woolly-headed negro till the year</hi> 1100, when the cruſaders fell in with a ſmall party of them near the town of Hebron in Judea, and were so ſtruck with the novelty of their appearance, that the army burſt into a general fit of laughter. Long before the crusades, however, we know with certainty that the natives <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Guinea had been expoſed to ſale in foreign countries. In 651 the Mahometan Arabs of Egypt ſo haraſſed the king of Nubia or Ethiopia, who was a Chriſtian, that he agreed to ſend them annually, by way of tribute, a <hi rend="italic">vast number of Nubian or Ethiopian slaves</hi> into Egypt. Such a tribute as this at that time, we are told, was more agreeable to the khalif than any other, as the Arabs then made <hi rend="italic">no ſmall account oſ thoſe slaves</hi>.</p><p>The very propoſal of ſuch a tribute, and the eſtimation in which black ſlaves were held in Egypt, ſhows that a commerce in bond-ſervants could not then be a new branch of trade either to the Arabs or the Ethiopians ; but the vaſt number which the Ethiopian monarch was now compelled to furniſh every year, induced him to feed this great drain upon his ſubjects from the natives of the neighbouring countries. “ He ranged accordingly into all that vaſt <hi rend="italic">blank of geography</hi> upon the map of the world, the ſpreading boſom of the African continent ; and even puſhed through it to its  fartheſt extremities in the west. He thus brought the blacks oſ Guinea, for the firſt time, into the ſervice and families of the eaſt ; and the ſlaves which he paid in tribute to the Arabs, whether derived from the nearer neighbourhood of Ethiopia, fetched from the mediterranean regions of Africa, or brought from the dictant ſhores of the Atlantic, were all denominated <hi rend="italic">Ethiopians, </hi>from the country by which they were conveyed into Egypt. “ At this time, therefore, according to Mr Whitaker, began that kind of traffic in human fleſh</p><p>“ Which ſpoils unhappy Guinea of its ſons.”</p><p>There are not many authors from whom, in questions of antiquity, we differ with greater heſitation ; but, as we meet with a female Ethiopian ſlave in the Eunuch of Terence, we cannot help ſuſpecting that Guinea was occaſionally " ſpoiled of its ſons” at a much earlier period. At any rate, from the obſervations made by the European</p><p>travellers who firſt penetrated into that continent, it appears undeniable that ſlavery muſt have prevailed from time immemorial among ſuch of the tribes as had never carried on any commerce with foreign nations. When Battel firſt viſited the Giagas@@*, thoſe people had never before ſeen a white man ; yet they welcomed him and the Engliſh, with whom he had come, to their country, invited them, to bring their goods on ſhore, and without heſitation loaded the ſhip with ſlaves. The Giagas were indeed waging war with the kingdom oſ Benguela; and being cannibals, who prefer human fleſh to all others, the ſlaves whom they had sold to the Engliſh were probably priſoners whom they would have killed and eaten if they had not found an opportunity of otherwiſe diſpoſing of them to greater advantage. But as they had not been incited by the Europeans to eat their priſoners, there can be no reaſon to ſuppoſe that by the Europeans they had been firſt induced to ſell them: for we have ſeen that this kind of commerce prevailed in Africa among people much more poliſhed than the Giagas ſo early as in the reign of Jugurtha.</p><p>That it was not introduced among the negroes either by the Arabs or by the Portugueſe, appears ſtill more evident from the behaviour of the Dahomans at the conqueſt of Whidah, and from the manner in which the people of Angola at the earlieſt ſtage of their foreign trade procured a ſupply of ſlaves for the Portugueſe market. The greater part of the ſlaves whom the Angolans exported from St Paulo de Loanda were brought from interior countries, ſome hundreds of leagues ditant, where they could not have been regularly purchaſed had that commerce been till then unknown in thoſe countries. The Dahomans, in the beginning of the year 1727, had never ſeen a white man : and when their victorious prince and his army, in their rout through Whidah, firſt met with ſome Europeans in the town of Sabi, they were ſo ſhocked at their complexion and their dreſs, that they were afraid to approach them, and could not be perſuaded that they were men till they heard them ſpeak, and were assured by the Wlridaneſe that theſe were the merchants who purchaſed all the ſlaves that were sold in Guinea @@*. Slavery, therefore, if it prevailed among the Dahomans before that period, could not have been introduced among them by European or Arabian intrigues: but we are assured by Snelgrave, who was then in the army, that thoſe people treated their captives with ſuch horrid cruelty as was shocking to the natives of the ſea-coaſt, and leaves no room for doubt but that ſlavery had been practiſed among them from the earlieſt ages. A great part of their priſoners were ſacriſiced to their gods or eaten by the loldiers ; and when our author expreſſed to a colonel of the guard ſome surpriſe that a prince ſo enlightened as the ſovereign of Dahomy ſhould ſacrifice ſo many men whom he might have sold to great advantage, he was gravely told, that it had been the cuſtom of their nation, from time immemorial, to offer, after victory, a certain number of priſoners to the gods; and that they ſelected the old men for victims, becauſe they were of leſs value at market, and more dangerous from their experience and cunning, than the young men. To thoſe perlons who fancy that the wars between the African princes are carried on for the ſole purpose of ſupplying the European ſhips with ſlaves, it may be proper to remark, that one of the kings of Dahomy ſlaughtered at once not only all the captives ta-</p><p>@@@[m]* Modern Universal History, vol. xiii. chap. 47. sect 2. </p><p>@@@[m]* Modern Universal History, vol. xiii. p. 340, &amp;c. </p></body></text></TEI>
