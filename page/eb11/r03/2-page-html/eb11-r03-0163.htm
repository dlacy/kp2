<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dormice.—</span><span class="font0">The next three sections of the order, namely, the Myoxoidea, or dormice, Dipodoidea, or jerboas, and Myoidea, or the&nbsp;mouse group, have the following characteristics in common. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">angular process of the lower jaw has the same relations as in the sewdlels and the allied groups. The lachrymal foramen in the&nbsp;skull is low down and&nbsp;forms an elongated slit.&nbsp;In the carpus the scaphoid and lunar are&nbsp;welded, but the centrale&nbsp;remains distinct. Thetibia&nbsp;and fibula are fused at&nbsp;their upper and lower&nbsp;ends. The malleus and&nbsp;incus of the inner ear&nbsp;are separate. Except in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">LophiOmys<sub>y</sub></span><span class="font0"> the clavicles&nbsp;are complete. The infraorbital foramen of the&nbsp;skull (fig. 9) is more or&nbsp;less broad; and there is&nbsp;generally a transverse&nbsp;canal. The stomach is&nbsp;generally complex.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the dormice, forming the section Myoxi-dea, with the single family GIiridae (or My-oxidäe), a single pair of&nbsp;premolars may or may&nbsp;not be present ; the molars&nbsp;are short-crowned and&nbsp;rooted, with transverse&nbsp;enamel-folds. The angle&nbsp;of the lower jaw is twisted&nbsp;and its coronoid process&nbsp;slender. Dormice are&nbsp;small arboreal rodents, with long hairy tails, large eyes and ears, and&nbsp;short fore-limbs, ranging over Europe, Asia and Africa. Of the four&nbsp;genera in the typical sub-family GIirinae, the first is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Glis<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font0"> represented&nbsp;by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Glis vulgaris</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">G. glis)</span><span class="font0"> of Europe, wdth a doubly vaned, bushy&nbsp;tail, simple stomach, and large molars with well-marked enamel-folds;&nbsp;the second, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Museardinus,</span><span class="font0"> with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">M. avellanarius,</span><span class="font0"> the common dormouse, distinguished by the cylindrical bushy tail, and thickened&nbsp;glandular walls of the cardiac extremity of the oesophagus; thirdly,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eliornys,</span><span class="font0"> containing several species, with tufted and doubly vaned&nbsp;tails, simple stomachs and smaller molar teeth, having concave&nbsp;crowns and faintly marked enamel-folds; and lastly, the African&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Graphiurus<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font0"> represented by several species, with short cylindrical&nbsp;tails ending in a pencil of hairs, and very small molars almost&nbsp;without trace of enamel-folds. None of the members of the typical&nbsp;sub-family extend into India, where the group is represented by&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Platacanthomys,</span><span class="font0"> typifying the sub-family Platacanthomyinae,&nbsp;characterized by the absence of premolars; the other being the&nbsp;Chinese </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlomys:</span><span class="font0"> These are small rodents wdth somewhat&nbsp;the appearance of the pigmy squirrels </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Nannosciurus),</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;in some degree connect the family with the Muridac. (See&nbsp;Dormouse.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jerboa Group<sub>t</sub>--Thc</span><span class="font0"> Dipiodoidca, or jerboa-group, which likewise includes only a single family, JacuIidae (or Dipodidae), is characterized by the presence of not more than one pair of premolars in the&nbsp;upper jaw, which, however, may be wanting; by the rooted cheekteeth, λνΗοΙι have transverse enamel-folds, and the absence of a&nbsp;transverse canal in the skull, and of a horny layer in the stomach.&nbsp;The family is divisible into two sub-families, of which the first,&nbsp;OrSminthinae, is represented only by the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sminthus<sub>t</sub></span><span class="font0"> containing&nbsp;a few species which range from Denmark into Western Asia,&nbsp;Kashmir and China. They are small rat-like rodents, with one&nbsp;pair of upper premolars, which are mere pins, as is the last molar,&nbsp;and the two pairs of limbs of normal length, wdth the metatarsals&nbsp;separate; the infra-orbital opening in the skull being triangular&nbsp;and widest below, while the incisive foramina in the palate are&nbsp;elongated. The European 5. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">stibtilis</span><span class="font0"> has a black dorsal stripe&nbsp;bordered with yellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Dipodinae, on the other hand, are leaping rodents, with the metatarsals elongated, a small upper premolar present or&nbsp;absent, and the crowns of the molars tall. Various degrees of&nbsp;specialization occur in the adaptation for leaping. The least&nbsp;specialized genus is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">'Aapus,</span><span class="font0"> containing the jumping-mice of North&nbsp;America, with one outlying Siberian species, in which the five&nbsp;metatarsals arc free, as are also the cervical vertebrae, the small&nbsp;upper premolar being retained. (See Jumping-Mouse.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the other genera, so far as known, the three central metatarsals of the hind foot are fused into a cannon-bone, of a type unique&nbsp;among mammals and comparable to that of birds. Some of the&nbsp;cervical Vertebraeare also united in at least the better-known genera.&nbsp;The tail and ears are generally very long; while, in correlation with&nbsp;the size of the latter, the auditory bullae of the skull are also large.&nbsp;In the typical jerboas, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jaculus</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dipus\</span><span class="font0"> ranging from North&nbsp;Africa to Persia, Russia and Central Asia, there are only three&nbsp;hind toes, the incisors are grooved, and the premolars are generally&nbsp;wanting. The other genera have five toes, of which only the&nbsp;middle three are functional, and smooth incisors. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Euchoreutes,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">with one Yarkand species, has premolars, enormous ears and a long&nbsp;nose. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alactaga,</span><span class="font0"> ranging over Russia and Western and Central&nbsp;Asia, inclusive of Persia and Baluchistan, has smaller ears and a&nbsp;shorter nose; by some naturalists it is taken to include the North&nbsp;African </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A. tetradactylus,</span><span class="font0"> which is separated by others as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scarturus<sub>t&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font0">The Turkestan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Platyeercomys</span><span class="font0"> (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pygeretmus)</span><span class="font0"> has a lancet-shaped&nbsp;tail and no premolars; while </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cardiocranus</span><span class="font0"> of the Nan-shan district&nbsp;of Central Asia has a similar type of tail, but short ears and a&nbsp;peculiarly triangular skull. (See Jerboa.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mole-Rats.—</span><span class="font0">The mole-rats (Spalacidae) bring us to the mouselike section, or Myoidea, in which there are no premolars and the molars may be</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">occasionally reduced to i; these teeth being either&nbsp;rooted or rootless,&nbsp;with either cusps&nbsp;or enamel-folds,&nbsp;and the first generally larger than&nbsp;the secon d. In&nbsp;the skull the&nbsp;zygomatic arch is&nbsp;slender and the&nbsp;jugal bone small&nbsp;and not extending far forwards,&nbsp;being supported&nbsp;by the long zygomatic process of&nbsp;the maxilla, while&nbsp;the infra-orbital&nbsp;foramen is mostly&nbsp;large, and there&nbsp;are no post-orbital processes. Although sometimes short, the&nbsp;tail is generally long, sparsely haired and scaly. The cardiac&nbsp;portion of the complex stomach has a horny layer, and there is&nbsp;a caecum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The SpaIacidae are burrowing types, allied apparently to the ancestral Jaculidae, and characterized by the second and third&nbsp;molars being equal in size, the presence of enamel-folds in all these&nbsp;teeth, and the superiority in size of the claw’s of the second, third&nbsp;and fourth front toes over the other tw<sup>r</sup>o. All these &quot; rodent-moles ” are .thoroughly adapted to a subterranean life, the eyes&nbsp;and ears being small and rudimentary, as is also the tail; while&nbsp;the bodily form is cylindrical, and the front claws are very large&nbsp;and powerful. The incisors are very large; and the palate of&nbsp;the skull is narrow. The typical representative of the group is&nbsp;the great mole-rat </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Spalax typhlus)</span><span class="font0"> of Eastern Europe and North-East Africa, which, together with a few closely allied species, has&nbsp;the eyes completely buried in the skin, and the head much flattened.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
