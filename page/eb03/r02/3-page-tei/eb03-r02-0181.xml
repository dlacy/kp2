It is not well known whether he was the adviſer of all the cruelties that enſued ſoon after ; but certain it is, that, from the beginning of his miniſtry, Tiberius ſeemed to become more fatally ſu-ſpicious.</p><p>It was ſrom ſuch humble beginnings that this miniſter even ventured to aſpire at the throne, and was reſolved to make the emperor’s fooliſh conſidence one of the firſt ſteps to his ruin. However, he conſidered that cutting off Tiberius alone would rather retard than promote his deſigns while his ſon Druſus and the children of Germanicus were yet remaining. He therefore began by corrupting Livia, the wiſe of Druſus ; whom, after having debauched her, he prevailed upon to poiſon her huſhand. This was effected by means of a flow poifon (as we are told), which gave his death the appearance of a caſual diſtemper. Tiberius, in the mean time, either naturally phlegmatic, or at leaſt not much regarding his ſon, bore his death with great tranquillity. He was even heard to jell upon the occaſion; for when the ambaſſadors from Troy came ſomewhat late with their compliments of condolence, he anſwered their pretended diſtreſſes, by condoling with them alſo upon the loſs of Hector.</p><p>Sejanus having ſucceeded in this, was reſolved to make his next attempt upon the children of Germanicus, who were undoubted ſucceffors to the empire. However, be was fruſtrated in his deſigns, both with regard to the fidelity of their governors, and the chaſ-tity of Agrippina their mother. Whereupon he reſolved upon changing his aims, and removing Tiberius out of the city ; by which means he expected more frequent opportunities of putting his deſigns into execution. He therefore uſed all his addreſs to perſuade Tiberius to retire to ſome agreeable retreat, remote from Rome. By this he expected many advantages, ſince there could be no acceſs to the emperor but by him. Thus all letters being conveyed to the prince by ſoldiers at his own devotion, they would paſs through his hands ; by which means he muſt in time become the ſole governor of the empire, and at laſt be in a capacity of removing all obſtacles to his ambition. He now therefore began to inſinuate to Tiberius the great and numerous inconveniences of the city, the fatigues of attending the ſenate, and the ſeditious temper of the inferior citizens of Rome. Tiberius, either prevailed upon by his perſuaſions, or purſuing the natural turn of his temper, which led to indolence and debauchery, in the twelfth year of his reign left Rome, and went into Campania, under pretence of dedicating temples to Jupiter and Auguſtus. After this, though he removed to ſeveral places, he never returned to Rome ; but ſpent the greateſt part of his time in the iſland of Caprea, a place which was rendered as infamous by his pleaſures as deteſtable by bis cruelties, which were ſhoeking to human nature. Buried in this retreat, he gave himſelf up to his pleaſures, quite regardleſs of the miſeries of his ſubjects. Thus an inſurrection of the Jews, upon placing his ſtatue in Jeruſalem, under the government of Pontius Pilate, gave him no ſort of uneaſineſs. The falling of an amphitheatre at Fidenæ, in which ço,ooo perſons were either killed or wounded, no way affected his repoſe. He was only employed in ſtudying how</p><lb/><p>to vary his odious pleaſures, and forcing his feeble frame, ſhattered by age and former debaucheries, into the enjoyment of them. Nothing can preſent a more horrid picture than the retreat of this impure old man<hi rend="sub">r </hi>attended by all the miniſters of his perverted appetites. He was at this time 67 years old ; his perſon was moſt diſpleaſing ; and ſome ſay the diſagreeableneſs of it, in a great meaſure, drove him into retirement. He. was quite bald before ; his face was all broke out into ulcers, and covered over with plaſters ; his body was bowed forward, while its extreme height and leanneſs increaſed its deformity. With ſuch a perſon, and a mind ſtill more hideous, being gloomy, ſuſpicious, and cruel, he ſat down with a view rather of forcing his appetites than ſatisfying them. He ſpent whole nights in debaucheries at the table ; and he appointed Pomponius Flaccus and Lucius Piſo to the firſt poſts of the empire, for no other merit than that of having ſat up with him two days and two nights without interruption. Theſe he called his friends of all hours. He made one Novelius Torgnatus a praetor for being able to drink off five bottles of wine at a draught. His luxuries of another kind were ſtill more deteſtable, and ſeemed to increaſe with his drunkenneſs and gluttony. He made the moſt eminent women of Rome ſubſervient to his lulls ; and all his inventions only ſeemed calculated how to make his vices more extravagant and abominable. Tſe numberleſs obſcene medals dug up in that iſiand at this day bear witneſs at once to his ſhame, and the veracity of the hiſtorians who have deſcribed his debaucheries. In ſhort, in this retreat, which was ſurrounded with rocks on every ſide, he quite gave up the buſineſs of the empire ; or, if he was ever .active, it was only to do miſchief. But, ſrom the time of his retreat, he became more cruel, and Sejanus always endeavoured to increaſe his diſtruſts. Secret ſpies and informers were placed in all parts of the city, who converted the moſt harmleſs actions into ſubjects of offence. If any perſon of merit teſtiſied any concern for the glory of the empire, it was immediately con-ſtrued into a deſign to obtain it. If another ſpoke with regret of former liberty, he was ſuppofed to aim at re-eſtabliſhing the commonwealth. Every action became liable to forced interpretations ; joy expreſſed an hope of the prince’s death ; melancholy, an envying of his proſperity. Sejanus found his ai n every day ſucceeding ; the wretched emperor’s terrors were an inſtrument that he wrought upon at his pleaſure, and by which he levelled every obſtacle to his deſigns. But the chief objects of his jealouſy were the children of Germanicus, whom he reſolved to put out of the way. He therefore continued to render them obnoxious to the emperor, to alarm him with falſe reports of their ambition, and to terrify them with alarms of his intended cruelty. By theſe means, he ſo contrived to widen the breach, that he actually produced on both ſides thoſe diſpoſitions which he pretended to obviate ; till at length, the two princes Nero and Druſus were declared enemies to the ſtate, and afterwards ſtarved to death in priſon ; while Agrippina their mother was ſent into baniſhment.</p><p>In this manner Sejanus proceeded, removing all who ſtood between him and the empire, and every day increaſing in conſidence with Tiberius, and power with the ſenate. The number of his ſtatues exceeded even</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
