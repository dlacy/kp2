It iε the annual meetings of this court that produce to view men who would otherwiſe remain in τhe deepeſt obſcuritv. Ί here the humble paſtor, whole lot has been call in the remoteſt corner of the Highland wilds, feels himſelf, for a time, on a footing of equality with the firſt citizen in the kingdom : he can there diſpute with him the prize of eloquence, the moſt flattering diſtinction to a liberal mind ; a diſtinction which is naturally ſought after with the greater eager-neſs in that aſſembly, as the ſimple eſtabliſhment of the church of Scotland has rendered it the only pre-eminence to which the greateſt part of its members can ever hope to attain.</p><p>From the moment Dr Robertſon firſt appeared in this aſſembly, he became the object of univerſal attention and applauſe. His ſpeeches were marked with the ſame manly and perſuaſive eloquence that diſtin-guiſhcs his hiſtorical compoſitions ; and it was obſerved by all, that while his young rivals in oratory contented themſelves with opening a cauſe, or delivering a ſtudied harangue, he ſhowed equal ability to ſtart objections, to anſwer, or to reply ; and that even his moſt unpremeditated eſſuſions were not unadorned with thoſe harmonious and ſeemingly meaſured periods, which have been ſo much admired in his works of labour and reflection. He ſoon came to be conſidered as the ableſt ſupporter of the cauſe he choſe to eſpouſe, and was now the unrivalled leader of one of the great parties which have long divided the church of which he was a member.</p><p>When we reflect upon this circumſtance, and conſider how much mankind are the ſame in every ſociety, we ſhall be the leſs ſurpriſed to find, in the literary works of Dr Robertſon, an acquaintance with the human heart, and a knowledge of the world, which we look for in vain in other hiſtorians. The man who has ſpent his life in the difficult taſlc of conducting the deliberations of a popular aſſembly, in regulating the paſſions, the interdis, the prejudices, of a numerous faction, has advantages over the pedant, or mere man of letters, which no ability, no ſtudy, no ſecond-hand information, can ever compenſate.</p><p>The firſt work which extended the Doctor’s reputation beyond the walls of the general aſſembly, was a ſermon preached at Edinburgh before the ſociety for propagating Chriſtian knowledge, and afterwards publiſhed ; the ſubject of which was, ‘ The ſtate of the world at the appearance of Jeſus Chriſt.’ The ingenuity with which a number of detached circumſtances are there collected, and ſhown to tend to one Angle point, may perhaps rival the art which is ſo much admired in the b’ſhop of Meaux’s celebrated Univerſal Hiſtory.</p><p>This ſermon did great honour to the author ; and it is probably to the reputation he gained by it, that we</p><p>ought to attribute the unanimity with which he was called to be one of the miniſters of Edinburgh—an event which happened not long after, viz. in the year 1758. In 1759, he publiſhed, in two volumes quarto,</p><p>‘ The Hiſtory of Scotland, during the reigns of Queen Mary and of King James VI. till his Acceſſion to the Crown of England, wiſh a Review of the Scots Hiſtory previous to that period.’ This work in its ſtructure is one of the moſt complete of all modern hiſtories. It is not a dry jejune narrative of events, deſtitute of ornament ; nor is it a mere frothy relation, all glow and colouring. <hi rend="sup">r</hi>Ihe hiftoria∙.ι diſcovers a ſufficient ſtore of imagination to engage the reader’s attention, wiſh a due proportion of judgment to check the exuberance of fancy. The arrangtment of his work is admirable, and his deſcriptions are animated. His ſtyle is copious, nervous, and correct. He has diſplay ed conſummate ſkill in rendering ſuch paſſages of our hiſtory as are familiar to our recollection agreeable and entertaining. He has embelliſhed old materials with all the elegance of modern dreſs. He has very judſeiouſly avoided too circumſtantial a detail of trite facts. His narratives arc ſuccinct and ſpirited ; his reflections copious, frequent, and generally pertinent. His ſentiments reſpecting the guilt of Mary have indeed been warmly controverted by Meſſrs Tytler, Stuart, and Whitaker ; and the general opinion now ſeems to be, that their victory is complete.</p><p>1 hat victory, however, on the part of Whitaker, is ſullied by the acrimony with which he writes. Dr Robertſon was no rancorous or malignant enemy of the unfortunate queen. While relating, what he doubtleſs believed, he makes every poſſible allowance for Mary from the circumſtances in which ſhe was placed ; and his hiſtory will be read with pleaſure by candid men of all parties as long as the language in which it is com·, poſed ſhall continue to be underſtood.</p><p>In 1769, Dr Robertſon publiſhed, in three volumes quarto, The Hiſtory of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V. with a View of the Progreſs of Society in Europe, from the Subverſion of the Roman Empire to the beginning of the 16th century.—The vaſt and general importance of the period which this hiſtory compriſes, together with the reputation which our hi-ſtorian had deſervedly acquired, co-operated to raiſe ſuch high expectations in the public, that no work perhaps was ever more impatiently wiſhed for, or peruſed « with greater avidity. The firſt volume (which is a preliminary one, containing the progreſs of ſociety in Europe, as mentioned in the title) is a very valuable part of the work ; for it ſerves not only as a key to the pages that follow, but may be conſidered as a general introduction to the ſtudy of hiſtory in that period in which the ſeveral powers of Europe were formed into one great political ſyſtem, in which each took a ſtation, wherein it has ſince remained (till within a very few years at leaſt) with leſs alterations than could have been expected, after the ſhocks occaſioned by ſo many internal revolutions, and ſo many foreign wars. Of the hiſtory itſelf, it may be ſufficient to obſerve, that it is juſtly ranked among the capital pieces of hiſtorical excellence. There is an elegance of expreſſion, a depth of diſcernment, and a correctneſs of judgment, which do honour to the hiſtorian. The characters are inimitably penned. They are not contraſted by a ſtudied antitheſis, but by an oppoſition which reſults from a</p></body></text></TEI>
