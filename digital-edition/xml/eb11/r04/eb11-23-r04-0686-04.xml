                <p><label>ROMNEY, GEORGE</label> (1734-1802), English historical and portrait
                    painter, was born at Dalton-in-Furness, Lancashire, on the 26th of December
                    1734. His father was a builder and cabinet-maker of the place, and the son,
                    having manifested a turn for mechanics, was instructed in the latter craft,
                    showing considerable dexterity with his fingers, executing carvings of figures
                    in wood, and constructing a violin, which he spent much time in playing. He was
                    also busy with his pencil; and some of his sketches of the neighbouring rustics
                    having attracted attention, his father was at length induced to apprentice the
                    boy, at the age of nineteen, to an itinerant painter of portraits and domestic
                    subjects named Steele, an artist who had studied in Paris under Vanloo; but the
                    erratic habits of his instructor prevented Romney from making great progress in
                    his art. In 1756 he impulsively married a young woman who had nursed him through
                    a fever, and started as a portrait painter on his own account, travelling
                    through the northern counties, executing likenesses at a couple of guineas, and
                    producing a series of some twenty figure compositions, which were exhibited in
                    Kendal, and afterwards disposed of by means of a lottery.</p>
               <p>Having, at the age of twenty-seven, saved about £100, he left a portion of the
                    sum with his wife and family, and started to seek his fortune in London, never
                    returning, except for brief visits, till he came, a broken-down and aged man, to
                    die. Credit must, however, be given him for recognizing to some extent his
                    family responsibilities. He did not allow his wife and children to fall into
                    poverty, and he gave help to his brothers, who seem to have resembled him in a
                    kind of shiftlessness of temperament. In London he rapidly rose into popular
                    favour. His “ Death of General Wolfe ” was judged worthy of the second prize at
                    the Society of Arts, but a word from Reynolds in praise of Mortimer’s “ Edward
                    the Confessor ” led to the premium being awarded to that painter, while Romney
                    had to content himself with a donation of £50, an incident which led to the
                    subsequent coldness between him and the president which prevented him from
                    exhibiting at the Academy or presenting himself for its honours.</p>
               <p>In 1764 he paid a brief visit to Paris, where he was befriended by Joseph
                    Vernet; and his portrait of Sir Joseph Yates, painted on his return, bears
                    distinct traces of his study of the works of Rubens then in the Luxembourg
                    Gallery. In 1766 he became a member of the Incorporated Society of Artists, and
                    three years later he seems to have studied in their schools.</p>

               <p>Soon he was in the full tide of prosperity. He removed to Great Newport Street,
                    near the residence of Sir Joshua, whose fame in portraiture he began to rival in
                    such works as “ Sir George and Lady Warren ” and “ Mrs Yates as the Tragic
                    Muse”; and his professional income rose to £1200 a year. But this marked
                    increase in his popularity had the effect of enlarging his ambitions, and he
                    became anxious to attempt subjects which required more experience than he
                    possessed. Realizing as he did the need for more thorough knowledge, he was
                    seized with a longing to study in Italy; and in the beginning of 1773 he started
                    for Rome in company with Ozias' Humphrey, the miniature painter. On his arrival
                    he separated himself from his fellow-traveller and his countrymen, and devoted
                    himself to solitary study, raising a scaffold to examine the paintings in the
                    Vatican, and giving much time to work from the undraped model, of which his
                    painting of a “ Wood Nymph ” was a fine and graceful result. At Parma he
                    concentrated himself upon the productions of Correggio, which fascinated him and
                    greatly influenced his practice.</p>
               <p>In 1775 Romney returned to London, establishing himself in Cavendish Square, and
                    resuming his extensive and lucrative employment as a portrait painter, which in
                    1785, according to the estimate of his pupil Robinson, yielded him an income of
                    over £3600. The admiration of the town was divided between him and Reynolds. “
                    There are two factions in art,” said Lord Thurlow, <hi rend="sup">a</hi> and I
                    am of the Romney faction ”—and the remark, and the rivalry which it implied,
                    caused much annoyance to Sir Joshua, who was accustomed to refer contemptuously
                    to the younger painter as “the man in Cavendish Square.” Alter his return from
                    Italy Romney formed two friendships which powerfully influenced his life. He
                    became acquainted with Hayley, his future biographer, then in the zenith of his
                    little-merited popularity as a poet. His influence on the painter seems to have
                    been far from salutary. Weak himself, he flattered the weaknesses of Romney,
                    encouraged his excessive and morbid sensibility, disturbed him with amateurish
                    fancies and suggestions, and tempted him to expend on slight rapid sketches, and
                    ill-considered, seldom-completed paintings of ideal and poetical subjects,
                    talents which would have found fitter exercise in the steady pursuit of
                    portraiture. About 1783 Romney was introduced to Emma Hart, afterwards
                    celebrated as Lady Hamilton, and she became the model from whom he worked
                    incessantly. Her bewitching face smiles from numerous canvases; he painted her
                    as a Magdalene and as a Joan of Arc, as a Circe, a Bacchante^ a Cassandra; and
                    he has himself confessed that she was the inspirer of what was most beautiful in
                    his art. But her fascinations seem to have been too much for the more than
                    middle-aged painter, and they had their own share in aggravating that nervous
                    restlessness and instability, inherent in his nature, which finally ruined both
                    health and mind.</p>
               <p>In 1786 Alderman Boydell started his great scheme of the Shakespeare Gallery,
                    apparently at the suggestion of Romney. The painter at least entered heartily
                    into the plan, and contributed his scene from the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Tempest,</hi> and his “ Infant Shakespeare attended by the Passions,” the
                    latter characterized by the Redgraves as one of the best of his subject
                    pictures. Gradually he began to withdraw from portrait painting, to limit the
                    hours devoted, to sitters, and to turn his thoughts to mighty schemes of the
                    ideal subjects which he would execute. Already, in 1792, he had painted “ Milton
                    and his Daughters,” which was followed by “ Newton making Experiments with the
                    Prism.” He was to paint the Seven Ages, Visions of Adam with the Angel, “ six
                    other subjects from Milton—three where Satan is the.hero, and three from Adam
                    and Eve,—perhaps six of each.” Having planned and erected a large studio in
                    Hamsptead, he removed thither in 1797, with the fine collection of casts from
                    the antique which his friend Flaxman had gathered for him in Italy. But his
                    health was now irremediably shattered, and the man was near his end. In the
                    summer of 1799, suffering from great weakness of body and the profoundest
                    depression of mind, he returned to the north, to Kendal, where his deserted but
                    faithful and long-suffering wife received and tended him. He died on the 15th of
                    November 1802.</p>
               <p>The art of Romney, especially his figure subjects, suffered greatly from the
                    waywardness and instability of the painter’s disposition, from his want of fixed
                    purpose and sustained energy. He lacked the steadfast perseverance needful to
                    the accomplishment of a great picture. Afflicted as he was throughout his life
                    by an unreasonable timidity and by a self-consciousness which led him at one
                    moment into assertive affectations and at another into exaggerated humility, he
                    avoided the society of his brother artists and lost many opportunities of
                    receiving that frank professional criticism which might have stimulated him to
                    more serious effort. In unwholesome surroundings he steadily deteriorated. His
                    imagination flashed and flickered fitfully upon him, like April sunshine. His
                    fancy would be captivated by a subject, which was presently embodied in a
                    sketch, but the toil of elaborating it into the finished completeness of a
                    painting too frequently overtaxed his powers; he became embarrassed by technical
                    difficulties which, through defective early training, he was unable to surmount,
                    and the half-covered canvas would be turned to the wall. Even in the pictures he
                    finished he was unable to keep to any consistent level of achievement. He
                    produced some fine things, very personal in style and very skilful in handling;
                    but much that he did seems too tentative and too plainly deficient in shrewdness
                    of insight to deserve serious consideration. His colour, too, was often
                    unpleasant, hot and monotonous, and his composition was apt to be stilted and
                    artificial. It is in the best of his portraits that we feel the painter’s real
                    ability. These, especially his female portraits, are full of grace, charm,
                    distinction, and sweetness. When we examine his heads of Cowper and Wilkes, his
                    delicate and dignified full-length of William Beckford, his “ Parson’s Daughter
                    ” in the National Gallery, and his group of the Duchess of Gordon and her Son,
                    we cannot deny his claim to rank as one of the notable portrait painters of
                    18th-century England.</p>
