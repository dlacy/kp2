                <p><label>SACK</label>, a wine uſed by our anceſtors, which ſome have taken to be
                    Rheniſh and ſome Canary wine. — Venner, in his <hi rend="italic">Via Rectα ad
                        Vitam Longam,</hi> printed in 1628, says that ſack is “completely not in the
                    third degree, and that ſome affect to drink ſack with ſugar and ſome without;
                    and upon no other ground, as I think, but as it is best pleaſing to their
                    palate.” He goes on to ſay, “ that ſack, taken by itſelf, is very hot and very
                    penetrative; being taken with ſugar, the heat is both ſomewhat allayed, and the
                    penetrative quality thereof alſo retarded. ” He adds further, that Rheniſh,
                    &amp;c. decline after a twelvemonth, but ſack and the other ſtronger wines are
                    beſt when they are two or three years old. It appears to be highly probable that
                    ſack was not a ſweet wine, from its being taken with ſugar, and that it did not
                    receive its name from having a ſaccharine flavour, but from its being originally
                    ſtored in ſacks or borachios. It does not appear to have been a French wine, but
                    a ſtrong wine the production of a hot climate. Probably it was what is called
                    dry mountain, or ſome Spaniſh wine of that kind. This conjecture is the more
                    plauſible, as Howell, in his French and Eng- liſh Dictionary, printed in the
                    year 1650, tranſlates lack by the words <hi rend="italic">vin d'Eſpagne, vin
                        ſec.</hi></p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">SACK oſ Wool,</hi> a quantity of wool containing juſt 22 ſtone,
                    and every ſtone 14 pounds. In Scotland, a ſack is 24 ſtone, each ſtone
                    containing 16 pounds.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">SACK oſ Cotton Wool,</hi> a quantity from one hundred and a
                    half to four hundred weight.</p>
                <p><hi rend="italic">SACKS oſ Earth,</hi> in fortification, are canvas bags filled
                    with earth. They are uſed in making retrenchments in haste, to place on
                    parapets, or the head of the breaches, &amp;c. to repair them, when beaten
                    down.</p>
