a cuſtomary contribution laid upon all ſubjects, according to their abilities. Whoever were aſſeſſed in any ſum, though not in equal proportions, were ſaid to pay foot and lot.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scot</hi> (Michael) of Balwirie, a learned Scottiſh author of the 13th century. This ſingular man made the tour of France and Germany; and was received with ſome diſtinction at the court of the emperor Frederic II. Having travelled enough to gratify his curioſity or his vanity, he returned to Scotland, and gave himſelf up to ſtudy and contemplation. He was ſkilled in languages; and, conſidering the age in which he lived, was no mean proficient in philoſophy, mathematics, and medicine. He tranſlated into Latin from the Arabic, the hiſtory of animals by the celebrated phy-<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0726.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0720"/>
ſician Avicenna. He publiſhed the whole works of Ariſtotle, with notes, and affected much to reaſon on the principles of that great philoſopher. He wrote a book concerning <hi rend="italic">The Secrets oſ Nature,</hi> in which he treats of generation, phyſiognomy, and the ſigns by which we judge of the temperaments of men and women. We have alſo a tract of his <hi rend="italic">On the Nature oſ the Sun and Moon.</hi> He there ſpeaks of the <hi rend="italic">grand operation,</hi> as it is termed by alchymiſts, and is exceedingly ſolicitous about the <hi rend="italic">projected powder,</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">philoſopher's done.</hi> He likewiſe publiſhed what he calls <hi rend="italic">Mensa Philoſophica,</hi> a treatiſe replete with aſtrology and chiromancy. He was much admired in his day, and was even ſnſpectcd oſ magic; and had Roger Bacon and Cornelius Agrippa for his panegyriſts.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Scot</hi> (Reginald), a judicious writer in the 16th century, was the younger ſon of Sir John Scot of Scot’s-hall, near Smeethe in Kent. He ſtudied at Hart-hall in the univerſity of Oxford; after which he retired to Smeethe, where he lived a ſtudious life, and died in 1599. He publiſhed, <hi rend="italic">The perfect Platform oſ a Hοp-garden;</hi> and a book intitled, The <hi rend="italic">Diſcovery of Witchcraft;</hi> in which he ſhowed that all the relations concerning magicians and witches are chimerical. This work was not only cenſured by king James I. in his <hi rend="italic">Daemonology,</hi> but by ſeveral eminent divines; and all the copies of it that could be found were burnt.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
