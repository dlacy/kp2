<p><span class="font1">ſon why in ſerene weather the atmofphcrical electricity is always ſtrongeſt, and rather more ſo in the night than&nbsp;in the day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From theſe conſiderations, we ſee an evident rea-ſon why there muſt commonly be a difference between&nbsp;the electricity of the earth and that of the atmo-ſphere, excepting when an earthquake is about to en-fue. The confequence of this muſt be, that as the&nbsp;action of the ſolar light continues to bring down the&nbsp;electric matter, and the earth continues to difcharge an&nbsp;equal quantity of it into the atmoſphere, ſome part of&nbsp;the atmoſphere muſt at laſt become overloaded with it,&nbsp;and attempt to throw it back into the earth. This&nbsp;attempt wiſl be vain, until a vent is found for the electricity at ſome other place ; and as foon as this happens, the electrified atmoſphere begins to throw off its&nbsp;ſuperfluous electricity, and the earth to receive it. As&nbsp;the atmoſphere itſelf is a bad conductor, and the more&nbsp;ſo the drier it is, the electric matter attacks the ſmaſl&nbsp;aqueous particles which are detained in it by means of&nbsp;the latent heat. Thefe being unable to bear the im-petus of the fluid, throw out their latent heat, which&nbsp;eaſily eſcapes, and thus makes a kind of vacuum in&nbsp;the electrified part of the atmoſphere. The conſequences of this are, that the aqueous particles being&nbsp;driven together in large quantity, at laſt become vi-ſible, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jky</span><span class="font1"> is covered with clouds ; at the fame&nbsp;time a wind blows againſt thefe clouds, and, if there is&nbsp;no reſiſtance in the atmoſphere, wiſl drive them away.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if the atmofphere all round the cloud is ex-cεedingly electrified, and the earth is in no condition&nbsp;to receive the ſuperfluous fluid excepting in that place&nbsp;■which is directly under the cloud, then the whole electricity of the atmofphere for a vaſt way round wiſl tend&nbsp;to that part only, and the cloud wiſl be electrified to&nbsp;an extreme degree. A wind wiſl now blow againſt the&nbsp;cloud from all quarters, more and more of the vapour&nbsp;wiſl be extricated from the air by the electric matter,&nbsp;and the cloud wiſl become darker and thicker, at the&nbsp;ſame time that it is' in a manner ſtationary, as· being acted upon by oppoſite winds ; though its ſize is enlarged&nbsp;with great rapidity by the continual ſupplies of vapour&nbsp;brought by the winds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The vapours which were formerly ſuſpended in-viſibly by means of the latent heat are now ſuſpended&nbsp;viſibly by the electric fluid, which wiſl not let them&quot;&nbsp;fall to the earth, until it is in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">condition to rε-ceive the electric matter deſcending with the rain.—&nbsp;It is eaſy to ſee, however, that thus every thing is&nbsp;prepared for a violent ſtorm of thunder and lightning&nbsp;as well as rain. The ſurface of the earth becomes&nbsp;electrified from the atmoſphere : but when this has con-tinued for ſome time, a zone of earth conſiderably below the ſurface acquires an electricity oppoſite to that&nbsp;of the clouds and atmoſphere ; of conſequence the elec-tricity in the cloud being violently preſſed on aſl ſides,&nbsp;wiſl at laſt burſt out towards that zone where the re-ſiſtance is leaſt, as explained under the article Light-ning.—The vapours now having loſt that which ſup-ported them, wiſl fall down in rain, if there is not a&nbsp;ſufficient quantity of electric matter to keep them in&nbsp;the ſame ſtate in which they were before : but if this&nbsp;happens to be the cafe, the cloud wiſl inſtantly be&nbsp;charged again, while little or no rain wiſl faſl ; and&nbsp;hence very </span><span class="font0">violent thunder fometimes takes place with-</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">out any rain at aſl, or ſuch as is quite inconfiderable in quantity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">9. when the electricity is leſs violent, the rain wilI&nbsp;deſcend in vaſt quantity, efpecially after every flaih of&nbsp;lightning ; and great quantities of electric matter wiſl&nbsp;thus be conveyed to the earth, inſomuch that ſometimes&nbsp;the drops have been obſerved to ſhine as if they were&nbsp;on fire, which has given occaſion to the reports of fiery&nbsp;rain having fallen on certain occaſions. If the quantity&nbsp;of electric matter is ſmaller, ſo that the rain can convey it all gradually to the ground, there wiſl be rain&nbsp;without any thunder ; and the greater the quantity of&nbsp;electricity the more violent wiſl be the rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From this account of the cauſes of rain, we may ſee the reaſon why in warm climates the rains are&nbsp;exceffive, and for the moſt part accompanied with thun-der ; for there the electricity of the atmoſphere is im-menfely greater than it is with us. we may alld fee&nbsp;why in certain places, according to the ſituation of&nbsp;mountains, ſeas, &amp;c. the rains will be greater than in&nbsp;others, and likewiſe why fome parts of the world are&nbsp;exempted from rain altogether ; but as a particular diſcuſſion of thefe would neceſſarily include an explana-tion of the cauſes and phenomena of Thunder, we&nbsp;ſhall foi this reaſon refer the whole to be treated of under that article.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">whether this theory be juſt, however, it would be too ⅛ affuming in us to ſay. It may admit of difpute, for we muſt&nbsp;grant that in the very beſt ſyſtems, though an occur-rence ſo frequent, the theory of rain is but very imperfectly underſtood. Dr James Hutton, Fellow of the&nbsp;Royal Society of Edinburgh, whofe ſpeculations are&nbsp;always ingenious, though generally extraordinary, and&nbsp;much out of the common way, gives us a new theory&nbsp;of rain in the firſt volume of the Tranſactions of that&nbsp;ſociety. It is well known that atmoſpheric air is capable of diſſolving, with a certain degree of heat, a gi-ven quantity of water. The Doctor aſcertains the ra-tio of the diſſolving power of air, in relation to water,&nbsp;in different degrees of heat ; and ſhows, that by mixing&nbsp;a portion of tranfparent humid warm air with a portion&nbsp;of cold air, the mixture becomes opake, and part of the&nbsp;water wiſl be precipitated ; or, in other words, the va-pour </span><span class="font0">yfill </span><span class="font1">be condenſed into rain. The ratio which he&nbsp;ſtates, however, does not appear to us to be ſupported&nbsp;by experience. whether the electricity of the air&nbsp;changes in conſequence of its depoſiting the water diſ-ſolved in it, or the change is a caufe of this depoſition,&nbsp;muſt remain uncertain ; but, in either view, there muſt&nbsp;be an agent different from heat and cold, ſince the&nbsp;changes in theſe reſpects do not in other operations&nbsp;change the ſtate of electricity. Dr Hutton ſuppoſes&nbsp;that heat and folution do not increaſe by equal increments ; but that, in reality, if heat be ſuppoſed to in-creaſe by equal increments along a ſtraight line, ſolution&nbsp;wiſl be expreſſed by ordinates to a curve whoſe convex&nbsp;ſide is turned towards that line. That the power of&nbsp;ſolution is not increaſed in the ſame ratio with heat, is,&nbsp;however, hypothetical, except when we riſe pretty high&nbsp;in the ſcale, when its proportional increaſe is a littler&nbsp;doubtful ; and it is not, in this paper, fupported by ex-periment. The condenſation of the breath in air is not&nbsp;an obſervation in point, except in air already ſaturated&nbsp;with vapour. It can amount, in any view, to no more&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">than this, that to render </span><span class="font1">it viſible, </span><span class="font0">the heat </span><span class="font1">muſt be di-</span></p>
