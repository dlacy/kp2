<p><span class="font0">Ardea, the capital of that nation, which lay about 20 miles from P.ome, in hopes of taking it without oppoſition. Contrary to his expectation, however, he&nbsp;λvas obliged to beſiege it in form ; and this conſtrained&nbsp;him to lay a heavy tax upon his ſubjects, which increaſed the number of malcontents, and diſpoſed every thing&nbsp;ſor a revolt. As the ſiege was carried on very ſlowly,&nbsp;the general officers frequently made entertainments for&nbsp;one another in their quarters. One day, when Sextus&nbsp;Tarquinius was entertaining his brothers, the converſation happened to turn upon their wives : every one&nbsp;extolled the good qualities of his own ; but Collatinus&nbsp;beſtowed ſuch extravagant praiſes on his Lucretia,&nbsp;that the diſpute ended in a kind of quarrel. It was&nbsp;then reſolved that they ſhould mount their horſes and&nbsp;ſurpriſe their wives by their unexpected return. The&nbsp;king’s daughters-in-law were employed in feaſting and&nbsp;diverſion, and ſeemed much diſconcerted by the appearance of their huſhands ; but Lucretia, though the&nbsp;night was far advanced, was found, with her maids&nbsp;about her, ſpinning and working in wool. She was&nbsp;not at all diſcompoſed by the company whom her&nbsp;huſhand brought with him, and they were all pleaſed&nbsp;with the reception ſhe gave them. As Lucretia was&nbsp;very beautiful, Sextus Tarquinius conceived a paſſion&nbsp;for her, which reſolving to ſatisfy at all events, he&nbsp;ſoon returned to Collatia in the abſence of Lucretia’s&nbsp;huſhand, and was entertained by her with great civility&nbsp;and reſpect. In the night-time he entered Lucretia’s&nbsp;apartment, and threatened her with immediate death if&nbsp;ſhe did not yield to his deſires. But finding her not&nbsp;to be intimidated with this menace, he told her, that,&nbsp;if ſhe ſtill perſiſted in her refuſal, he would kill one of&nbsp;her male ſlaves, and lay him naked by her when ſhe&nbsp;was dead, and then declare to all the world that he had&nbsp;only revenged the injury of Collatinus. On this the&nbsp;virtuous Lucretia (who, it ſeems, dreaded proſtitution&nbsp;leſs than the infamy attending it) ſubmitted to the deſires of Sextus ; but reſolved not to outlive the violence&nbsp;which had been offered her. She dreſſed herſelf in&nbsp;mourning, and took a poniard under her robe, having&nbsp;previouſly wrote to her huſhand to meet her at her father Lucretius’s houſe, where ſhe refuſed to diſcover&nbsp;the cauſe of her grief except in a full aſſembly of her&nbsp;friends and relations. Here, addreſſing herſelf to her&nbsp;huſhand Collatinus, ſhe acquainted them with the whole&nbsp;affair ; exhorted them to revenge the injury ; and proteſted that ſhe would not outlive the loſs of her honour.&nbsp;Every one preſent gave her a ſolemn promiſe that they&nbsp;would revenge her quarrel ; but while they endeavoured to comfort her, ſhe ſuddenly ſtabbed herſelf to the&nbsp;heart with the dagger which ſhe had concealed under&nbsp;her robe. See Chastity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This extravagant action inflamed beyond meaſure the minds of all preſent. Brutus, laying aſide his pretended folly, drew the bloody dagger out of Lucretia’s body ; and, ſhowing it to the aſſembly, ſwore by the blood&nbsp;upon it that he would purſue Tarquin and his family&nbsp;with fire and ſword : nor would he ever ſuffer that or&nbsp;any other family to reign in Rome.. The ſame oath&nbsp;was taken by all the company ; who were ſo much ſurpriſed at the apparent tranſition of Brutus from folly&nbsp;to wiſdom, that they did whatever he deſired them.—&nbsp;By his advice the gates of the city were ſhut, that nobody might go out of it to inform Tarquin of what</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">was going forward ; which, as Lucretius had been left governor of the city by Tarquin, was put in execution&nbsp;without difficulty. The corpſe of Lucretia was then&nbsp;expoſed to public view ; and Brutus having made a&nbsp;ſpeech to the people, in which he explained the myſte-ry of his conduct in counterfeiting ſolly for many years&nbsp;paſt, proceeded to tell them that the patricians were&nbsp;come to a reſolution of depoſing the tyrant, and exhorted them to concur in the ſame deſign. The people&nbsp;teſtiſied their approbation, and called out for arms ; but&nbsp;Brutus did not think proper to truſt them with arms&nbsp;till he had firſt obtained a decree of the ſenate in favour of the deſign. This was eaſily procured : the ſenate enacted that Tarquin had forfeited all the prero- ,&nbsp;gatives belonging to the regal authority, condemned&nbsp;him and all his poſterity to perpetual baniſhment, and&nbsp;devoted to the gods of hell every Roman who ſhould&nbsp;hereafter, by word or deed, endeavour his reſtoration ;&nbsp;and this decree was unanimouſiy confirmed by the&nbsp;curiæ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Tarquin being thus depoſed, the form of government became the next object. Lucretius was for the preſent&nbsp;declared </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Interrex ;</span><span class="font0"> but Brutus being again conſulted,&nbsp;declared, that though it was by no means proper for&nbsp;the ſtate to be without ſupreme magiſtrates, yet it was&nbsp;equally neceſſary that the power ſhould not be centered&nbsp;in one man, and that it ſhould not be perpetual. For&nbsp;this reaſon he propoſed, that two magiſtrates, called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conſuls,</span><span class="font0"> ſhould be elected annually ; that the ſtate ſhould&nbsp;thenceforth have the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">republic ;</span><span class="font0"> that the enſigns&nbsp;of royalty ſhould be aboliſhed ; and that the only en- ∙&nbsp;ſigns of conſular dignity ſhould be an ivory chair, a&nbsp;white robe, and 12 lictors for their attendants. However, that he might not utterly aboliſh the name oſ&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">king,</span><span class="font0"> he propoſed that this title ſhould be given to him&nbsp;who had the ſuperintendency of religious matters, who&nbsp;ſhould thenceforth be called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rex.ſacrorum,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">king oſſa-cred things.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This ſeheme of Brutus being approved of, Brutus and Collatinus were propoſed by Lucretius as the two firſt&nbsp;conſuls, and unanimouſiy accepted by the people, who&nbsp;thought it was impoſſible to find more implacable enemies to the Tarquins. They entered on their office&nbsp;in the year 508 B. C. ; and Tullia, perceiving that now&nbsp;all was loſt, thought proper to leave the city, and retire to her huſhand at Ardea. She was ſuffered to depart without moleſtation, though the populace hooted&nbsp;at her, and curſed her as ſhe went along. Tarquin, in&nbsp;the’mean time, being informed by ſome who had got.&nbsp;out of Rome before the gates were ſhut, that Brutus&nbsp;was raiſing commotions to his prejudice, returned in&nbsp;haſte to the city, attended only by his ſons and a few&nbsp;friends ; but, finding the gates ſhut, and the people irr&nbsp;arms on the walls, lie returned again to the camp : but&nbsp;here again, to his ſurpriſe, he found that the conſuls&nbsp;had taken the opportunity of gaining over the army to&nbsp;their intereſt ; ſo that, being refuſed admittance into&nbsp;the camp alſo, he was forced to fly for refuge, at the&nbsp;age of 76, with his wiſe and three ſons, to Gabii, where&nbsp;Sextus had been made king. Here he continued for&nbsp;ſome time : but not rinding the Latins very forward to&nbsp;revenge his cauſe, he retired into Hetruria where, being the country of his mother’s family, he hoped to&nbsp;find more friends, and a readier aſſiſtance for attempting&nbsp;the recovery of his throne.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
