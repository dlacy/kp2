<p><span class="font3">Germans. The city consists of two parts—the Domberg or Dom, which occupies a hill, and the lower town on the beach.&nbsp;The Dom contains the castle (first built in the 13th century,&nbsp;rebuilt in 1772), where the provincial administration has its&nbsp;seat, and a cathedral (1894-1900) with five gilded domes. It&nbsp;has its own administration, separate from that of the lower&nbsp;town. The church of St Nicholas, built in 1317, contains many&nbsp;antiquities of the former Roman Catholic times and old German&nbsp;paintings. The Dom church contains many interesting shields,&nbsp;as also the graves of the circumnavigator Baron A. J. von&nbsp;Krusenstern (1770-1846), of the Swedish soldiers Pontus de&nbsp;la Gardie (d. 1585) and Carl Horn (d. 1601), and of the&nbsp;Bohemian Protestant leader Count Matthias von Thum (1580-1640). The church of St Olai, first erected in 1240, and often&nbsp;rebuilt, was completed in 1840 in Gothic style; it has a bell&nbsp;tower 456 ft. high. The oldest church is the Esthonian, built&nbsp;in 1219. The public InstitutionsTnclude a good provincial&nbsp;museum of antiquities; an imperial palace, Katharinenthal,&nbsp;built by Peter the Great in 1719; and very valuable archives,&nbsp;preserved in the town halt (14th century). The pleasant&nbsp;situation of the town attracts thousands of people for seabathing. It is the seat of a branch board of the Russian&nbsp;admiralty and of the administration of the Baltic lighthouses.&nbsp;Its port has a depth of 4 to 6 fathoms, and a roadstead 3 j m.&nbsp;wide, which freezes nearly every winter. The exports consist&nbsp;chiefly of grain, timber, flax, hides, wool, a species of anchovy,&nbsp;and hemp, and the imports of manufactured goods and machinery.&nbsp;The value of the aggregate trade amounts to an average of seven&nbsp;to nine millions sterling annually. Theçp is considerable trade&nbsp;with Finland. Baltic Port, 30 m. W<sup>r</sup>., is a sort of annex to the&nbsp;port of Reval.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The high Silurian crag now known as Domberg was early occupied by an Esthonian fort, Lindanissa. In 1219 the Danish&nbsp;king Valdemar II. erected here a strong castle and founded the&nbsp;first church. In 1228 the castle was taken by the Livonian&nbsp;Knights, but nine years later it returned to the Danes. About&nbsp;the same time Lübeck and Bremen merchants settled there, and&nbsp;their settlement became an important seaport of the Hanseatic&nbsp;League. It was fortified early in the 14th century, and in 1343&nbsp;sustained a siege by the revolted Esthonians. Valdemar III.&nbsp;sold Reval and Esthonia to the Teutonic Knights in 1346, but&nbsp;on the dissolution of the order, in 1561, Esthonia and Reval&nbsp;surrendered to the Swedish king Erik XIV. A great conflagration in 1433, l^e pestilence of 1532, the bombardment by the&nbsp;Danes in 1569, and the Russo-Livonian War, destroyed its&nbsp;trade. The Russians besieged Reval twice, in 1570 and 1577.&nbsp;It was still an important fortress, having been enlarged and&nbsp;fortified by the Swedes. In 1710 it was surrendered to Peter&nbsp;the Great, who immediately began the erection of a military&nbsp;port for his Baltic fleet. His successors continued to fortify&nbsp;the access to Reval from the sea, large works being undertaken,&nbsp;especially in the early years of the 19th century.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REVELATION, BOOK OF, in the Bible, the last book of the New Testament.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Title.—</span><span class="font3">According to the best authorities κ CA (in the subscription) 2, 8, 82, 93, the title of this book is </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">άποκάλνφιχ</span><span class="font3"> Ίωάϊψου. Some cursives (1, 14, 17, 25, 28, 31, 38, 51, 90, 91, 94, 97)&nbsp;read </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">άπ.</span><span class="font3"> (+ του αγίου ι, 25, 28, 31, 38, 51, 90, 94) Τωάίψου </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">του&nbsp;OeoKbyov,</span><span class="font3"> Q and 12, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">άπ.</span><span class="font3"> Ί. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">του</span><span class="font3"> 0€ολ. καί «ύαγγ^λίστου; P and&nbsp;42, ή άττ. του άττοστόλου Ί. καί €ύαγγ€λίστου- IThe word “ apocalypse ” gives the current title not only to this book, but to a&nbsp;large body of Jewish and Christian writings. This is one of the&nbsp;first instances of its use in this sense in existing literature. An&nbsp;earlier use is probably to be found in the title of the Syriac&nbsp;Apocalypse of Baruch, which </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">=ypa&lt;fâ τη^ άποκ&lt;ι\ϋψεως του βαρούχ&nbsp;υΐοΰ του</span><span class="font3"> Νηρίσυ. The title is different from what the New Testament use of the term would have led us to expect, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font3"> ’Αποκάλυψή&nbsp;Ίϊ/σου, which are indeed the opening words of this book. With&nbsp;the latter phrase we might compare Gal. i. 12, where we&nbsp;have άττοκαλίψ«^« </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ίησου</span><span class="font3">Χρίστου,“ revelation from Jesus Christ.”&nbsp;For the book is a revelation made by Gcd to Jesus Christ, who&nbsp;through His angel made it known to John for transmission to&nbsp;the churches. Instead of this the Church Substituted the name&nbsp;of the disciple through whom the message was delivered for&nbsp;that of his Master, and designated our Apocalypse “ The&nbsp;Apocalypse of John.” This title was familiar before the end&nbsp;of the 2nd century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Λ/SS. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and Versions.—</span><span class="font3">There are six uncials, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">n,</span><span class="font3"> A, C, P, Q, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">3, </span><span class="font3">the last of which has not been edited or collated. Of the rest,&nbsp;P and Q are imperfect. The known cursives amount to 229,&nbsp;according to von Soden </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Die Schriften des Neuen Testamentes,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">I. i. 289). There are six ancient versions of various values,&nbsp;(a) The best is the Latin, which is found in the Old Latin&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(ghm</span><span class="font3"> and the text used by Primasius) and the Vulgate, of which&nbsp;there are eight MSS. written between the 6th and 15th centuries,&nbsp;(ό) The Syriac version appears in two forms, the Philoxenian&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 508), recently discovered and edited by Gwynn, and the&nbsp;Harclean </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 616). The true Peshitta did not contain the&nbsp;Apocalypse, (c) The Armenian version. The Apocalypse was&nbsp;admitted to the canon, according to Conybeare, in the 12th century&nbsp;through the influence of Nerses, who revised an older version&nbsp;traceable to the opening of the 5th century, (d) The Egyptian&nbsp;version is found in two forms, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font3"> the Bohairic and Sahidic.&nbsp;The former has been edited by Homer, who is now also engaged&nbsp;on an edition of the latter. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(e,f)</span><span class="font3"> The Ethiopic and Arabic&nbsp;versions have not yet been critically edited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">External Evidence and Canonicity, 2nd Century.—</span><span class="font3">It is possible that the Apocalypse was known to Ignatius, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Eph.</span><span class="font3"> xv. 3&nbsp;(Rev. xxi. 3); </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">PhilaA.</span><span class="font3"> vi. 1 (Rev. iii. 12). Some have thought&nbsp;also that Barnabas (vi. r3, xxi. 3) was acquainted with our text,&nbsp;but this is highly improbable. Andreas of Caesarea mentions&nbsp;Papias as attesting the credibility of Revelation, and cites two&nbsp;of his remarks on Rev. xii. 7. The fact that Eusebius does not&nbsp;mention Revelation among the New Testament books known to&nbsp;Papias </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(H.E.</span><span class="font3"> iii. 39) may be due to the historian’s unfriendly&nbsp;attitude to the book. Moreover, Papias may be one of the&nbsp;presbyters to whom, as having actually seen John, Irenaeus&nbsp;(v. 30 = Eusebius, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">H.E.</span><span class="font3"> v.8) appeals on behalf of the number 666.&nbsp;From these possible and highly probable references we pass on&nbsp;to the clear testimony of Justin Martyr, who is the first to declare&nbsp;that Revelation is by “ John, one of the Apostles of Christ ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Dial,</span><span class="font3"> lxxxi. 15), and a book of canonical standing (i. 28). In&nbsp;the latter half of this century it meets with very wide recognition. Thus a treatise of some description was written upon it&nbsp;by Melito of Sardis in Asia Minor (Eus.</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">H.E.</span><span class="font3"> iv. 26), and quoted&nbsp;by the anti-Montanist Apollonius </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(H.E.</span><span class="font3"> v. 18) and Theophilus&nbsp;of Antioch </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(H.E.</span><span class="font3"> iv. 24). In Carthage its currency is proven&nbsp;by the references of Tertullian, and the phraseology of the Acts&nbsp;of Perpetua and Felicitas (§§ 4, T2); in Alexandria by the&nbsp;citations of Clement </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Paed.</span><span class="font3"> i. 6. 36; ii. 10. 108, &amp;c.); in Rome&nbsp;by its inclusion in the Muratorian canon, and in Gaul by its&nbsp;use in the Epistle of the churches of Vienne and Lyons (Eus.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">H.E.</span><span class="font3"> v. 10. 58), and in Irenaeus, who defends the apostolic&nbsp;authorship of the Revelation of John </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Haer.</span><span class="font3"> iv. 14. 1,17. 6, r8.6,&nbsp;20. n, 21. 3; v. 26. i, &amp;c.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But in certain quarters the authority of the book was denied. Thus Marcion rejected it on the ground of its Jewish character&nbsp;(Tertullian, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">e. Marcion,</span><span class="font3"> iv. 5), and the Alogi assigned both Revelation and the Gospel to Cerinthus (Epiphanius, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Haer.</span><span class="font3"> Ii. 3).&nbsp;This attitude is more widely represented in the next century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Third Century.—</span><span class="font3">The attack on Revelation was resumed by abler antagonists in this century. The objections of the Alogi&nbsp;were restated and maintained by the Roman presbyter Caius&nbsp;in his controversy with the Montanist Proclus (Eus. H.E. ii. 25.6;&nbsp;iii. 28. 2), but met with such overwhelming refutation at the&nbsp;hands of Hippolytus (see Gwynn, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hermathena,</span><span class="font3"> vi. 397-418)&nbsp;that no church writer in the West subsequently except Jerome&nbsp;seriously called in question the authorship of our book.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Dionysius of Alexandria </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(a.d.</span><span class="font3"> 255) wrote a moderate and effective criticism, in which he rejects the hypothesis of the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
