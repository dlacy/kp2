It is likewise the name of a sort of slipper worn by several congregations of reformed monks. This last consists of no more than a mere leathern sole, fastened with latches or buckles, all the rest of the foot being left bare. The Capuchins wear sandals, and the Recollects clogs ; the former being of leather, and the latter of wood.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
