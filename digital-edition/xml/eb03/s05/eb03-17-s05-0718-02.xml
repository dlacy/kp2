an ancient Greek long meaſure, containing 125 geometrical paces, or 625 Roman feet, correſponding to our furlong. The word is ſaid to be formed from the Greek word ςασις “a ſtation,” or “ to ſtand,” becauſe it is reported that Hercules having run a stadium at one breath, flood still at the end of it. The Greeks uſually meaſured diſtances by ſtadia, which they called ςφαϐιασμς <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Stadium alſo signified the courſe on which their races were run.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
