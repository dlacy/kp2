Fifty-four of these belonged to Great Britain. The number which cleared outwards during the same period was eighty-four, the tonnage of the whole being 19,068. This shows an increase on the previous year. The total value of the imports for 1831, were L.104,639 ; and of the exports L.81,280. Subsequent returns for 1833-4, show a decrease, which does not correspond with the number of vessels which arrived at, and departed from the settlement. The chief articles of export are timber, cam wood, palm oil, ivory, rice, bees’ wax, gold, hides, &amp;c. In 1835, these were exported to the extent of L.58,174. The chief articles imported into Sierra Leone, are cottons, gunpowder, linens, salt, guns, iron, hard-wares, and cutlery, and others of our own manufactures. This settlement is kept up at a considerable yearly expenditure. For the five years ending 1824, it was L.75,000 per annum ; for the succeeding five years, it fell to about one-half that sum ; but still the revenue bears no proportion to the outlay. Sierra Leone is governed by a civil-lieutenant governor, assisted by a council. There is a chief-justice, and a vice-court of admiralty. There is also established, the mixed commission for the adjudication of vessels taken in the slave-trade. A detachment of the Royal African corps (blacks) is stationed in the settlement, under a lieutenantcolonel.</p><p>This colony was founded by Great Britain with the most philanthropic views. At the suggestion of Dr. Smeathmane, the negroes discharged from the army and navy, after the American war, were conveyed to Sierra Leone, furnished with necessaries for forming a colony in their native land. But a series of calamities overtook this singularly interesting band of settlers, which obliged those who escaped pestilence and the sword to take shelter on Bance island, a small place. However, the Sierra Leone Company was formed in Britain in 1787, and it sent out five vessels with stores, and other succours, to these black freemen, together with a large reinforcement of free negroes from America. Still the difficulties with which the colony had to struggle, again placed it in critical circumstances, whilst in 1794, it was plundered by the French ; and so much had calamities accumulated, that the company entered into an arrangement with the government, to place the colony under their jurisdiction. It was subsequently placed under the African Institution, established for the improvement of the western part of Africa. Great accessions were made to its population, by sending thither the negroes taken in slave ships, and to initiate them in the habits of civilized life ; the Church Missionary Society undertook to furnish schools and religious instructors. But the success of this body has not been equal to its benevolent intentions, at least with regard to other parts of Africa, little or no impression having as yet been made on the general mass of the population from this quarter. Since the dissolution of the African Company, Sierra Leone has again reverted to the British crown.</p><p>SIERRA-MOREN A, a range of remarkable mountains in the south of Spain. These mountains begin in the vicinity of Alcaraz, on the eastern borders of La Mancha, and extend between that province, Estremadura, and Alen- tejo, which it leaves to the north, and enters the kingdoms of Jaen, Cordova, Seville, and Algarve, and terminates at the sea shore at Cape St. Vincent. In its course through Cordova, it is called the Sierra de Cordova. On the south of Estremadura, and the north of Seville, it bears the name of the Guadalcanal mountains; it then trends to the southwest, where the northern side is called the Sierra of Cal- derion ; on the south, in the Portuguese province of Algarve, it is called the Sierre de Monchique.</p><p>The highest point of these mountains does not exceed 2700 feet above the level of the sea ; but from their summits being barren, and the lower parts mere morasses, they were</p><p>long deemed impassable, and were so deemed at the period when the author of Don Quixote chose them for the scene of the exploits of his hero.</p><p>In the late war with France, a pass through them was deemed by the Spaniards to be impregnable, but the French troops were adroit enough to turn them, and thus were enabled to pour their armies into Andalusia, and besiege Cadiz.</p><p>After the peace of 1763, king Charles the III. entertained the project of cultivating this district ; and Olavide, a benevolent and enterprising capitalist, transported thither a number of Germans, who were formed into colonies, and built several villages, and the town of Carolina. The face of the country was changed, and the soil found productive; the progress was advancing, when Olavide was involved in difficulties with the lnquisition, which gave a check to the operations, which the hostile operations carried on at subsequent periods have continued.</p><p>SIEUR, a title of respect amongst the French, like that of <hi rend="italic">master</hi> amongst us. It is much used by lawyers, as also by superiors in their letters to inferiors.</p><p>SIFANTO, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Siphanto,</hi> an island of the Archipelago, west of Paros, north-east of Milo, and south-west of Ser- phanto. The air is so good here, that many of the inhabitants live to the age of a hundred and twenty ; and their water, fruits, wild fowl, and poultry, are excellent, but more especially the grapes. It abounds with marble and granite, and is one of the most fertile and best cultivated of these islands. The inhabitants employ themselves in cultivating olive-trees and capers ; and they have very good silk. They trade in figs, onions, wax, honey, and straw-hats, and may be about eight thousand in all.

Lat. 37. 9.</p><p>SIGHING, an effort of nature, by which the lungs are put into greater motion, and more dilated, so that the blood passes more freely, and in greater quantity, to the left auricle, and thence to the ventricle. Hence we learn how sighing increases the force of the blood, and proportionally cheers and relieves nature, when oppressed by its too slow motion, which is the case of those who are dejected and sad.</p><p>SIGNALS, <hi rend="smallcaps">Naval.</hi> When we read at our fire-side the account of an engagement, or other interesting operation of an army, our attention is generally so much engaged by the results, that we give but little to the movements which led to them, and produced them ; and we seldom form to ourselves any distinct notion of the conduct of the day. But a professional man, or one accustomed to reflection, and who is not satisfied with the mere indulgence of eager curiosity, follows every regiment in its movements, endeavours to see their connection, and the influence which they have had on the fate of the day, and even to form to himself a general notion of the whole scene of action, at its different interesting periods. He looks with the eye of the general, and sees his orders succeed or fad.</p><p>But few trouble themselves farther about the narration. The movement is ordered ; it is performed ; and the fortune of the day is determined. Few think how all this is brought about ; and when they are told that during the whole of the battle of Custrin, Frederick the Great was in the upper room of a country inn, whence he could view the whole field, whilst his aides-de-camp, on horseback, waited his orders in the yard below, they are struck with wonder, and can hardly conceive how it can be done, but, on reflection, they see the possibility of the thing. Their imagination accompanies the messenger from the inn yard to the scene of action ; they hear the general’s orders delivered, and they expect its execution.</p><p>But when we think for a moment on the situation of the commander of a fleet, confined on board one ship, and this ship as much, or more closely, engaged, than any other of</p></body></text></TEI>
