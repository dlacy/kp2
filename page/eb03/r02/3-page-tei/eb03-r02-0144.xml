They were utter ſtran-gers to military exerciſes, and the art of handling arms; but Pyrrhus having cauſed an exact regiſter to be made of all the young men who were fit for war, picked out the ſtrongeſt amongſt them, and incorporated them among his own troops, ſaying, that he would take it upon himſelf to give them courage. He exerciſed them daily for ſeveral hours ; and on that occaſion behaved with an inexorable ſeverity, inflicting exemplary puniſhment on ſuch as did not attend or ſailed in their duty. By theſe wiſe meaſures he prevented ſeditions among the citizens, and inured their youth to military diſcipline ; and becauſe many, who had not been accuſtomed to ſuch ſeverity and rigour, withdrew from their native country, Pyrrhus, by a public proclamation, declared all thoſe capitally guilty who ſhould attempt to abandon their country, or abſent themſelves from the common muſters.</p><p>The Tarentines, being now ſenſible that Pyrrhus was determined to be their maſter, began loudly to complain of his conduct ; but he, being informed of whatever paſſed among them by his ſpies, who inſinuated themſelves into all companies, privately diſpatched the moſt factious, and ſent thoſe whom he ſuipected, under various pretences, to his ſon’s court in Epirus.</p><p>In the mean time, P. Valerius Lævinus, the Roman conſul, entering the country of the Lucanians, who were in alliance with the Tarentines, committed great ravages there ; and having taken and fortified one of their caſtles, waited in that neighbourhood for Pyrrhus. The king, though he had not yet received any ſuccours from the Samnites, Meſſapians, and other allies of the Tarentines, thought it highly diſhonourable to continue ſhut up in a city, while the Romans were ravaging the country of his friends. He therefore took the field with the troops he had brought with him from Epirus, ſome recruits of Tarentum, and a ſmall number of Italians. But before he began hoſtilities, he wrote a letter to Lævinus, commanding him to diſ-band his army ; and on his refuſal, immediately marched towards thoſe parts where Lævinus was waiting for him. The Romans were encamped on the hither ſide of the river Siris ; and Pyrrhus appearing on the oppoſite bank, made it his firſt buſineſs to reconnoitre the enemy’s camp in perſon, and ſee what appearance they made. With this view he croſſed the river, attended by Megacles, one of his officers and chief favourites ; and having obſerved the conſul’s intrenchments, the manner in which he had poſted his advanced guards, and the good order of his camp, he was greatly ſurpriſed ; and addrelſing Megacles, “ Theſe people (ſaid he) are not ſuch barbarians as we take them to be : let us try them before we condemn them.” On his return, he changed his reſolution of attacking them ; and, ſhut· ting himſelf up in his intrenchments, waited for the arrival of the confederate troops. In the mean time, he poſted ſtrong guards along the river, to prevent the enemy from paſſing it, and continually ſent out ſcouts to diſcover the deſigns, and watch the motions of the conſul. Some of theſe being taken by the advanced guards of the Romans, the conſiſt himſelf led them through his camp, and having ſhewed them his army, ſent them back to the king, telling them, that he had many other troops to ſhow them in due time.</p><p>Lævinus being determined to draw the enemy to a battle before Pyrrhus received the reinforcements he expected, having harangued his troops, marched to the banks of the Siris ; and there drawing up his infantry in battalia, ordered the cavalry to ſſte off, and march a great way about, in order to find a paſſage at ſome place not defended by the enerfiy. Accordingly, they paſſed the river without being obſerved ; and lalling upon the guards which Pyrrhus had poſted on the banks over-againſt the conſular army, gave the infantry an opportunity of croſſing the river on bridges which Lævinus had prepared for that purpoſe. But before they got over, Pyrrhus, haſtening from his camp, which was at ſome diſtance from the river, hoped to cut the Roman army in pieces while they were diiordered with the difficulties of paſſing the river, and climbing up the ſteep banks ; but the cavalry covering the infantry, and ſtanding between them and the Epirots, gave them time to form themſelves on the banks of the river. On the other hand, Pyrrhus drew up his men as faſt as they came ſrom the camp, and performed ſuch deeds of valour, that the Romans thought him worthy of the great reputation he had acquired.</p><p>As the cavalry alone had hitherto engaged, Pyrrhus, who confided moſt in his infantry, haſtened back to the camp, in order to bring them to the charge ; but took two precautions before he began the attack : the firſt was, to ride through the ranks, and ſhow himſelf to the whole army ; for his horſe having been killed under him in the firſt onſet, a report had been ſpread that he was ſlain : the ſecond was, to change his habit and helmet with Megacles ; for having been known in the engagement of the horſe by the richneſs of his attire and armour, many of the Romans had aimed at him in particular, ſo that he was with the utmoſt difficulty taken and ſaved, after his horſe had been killed under him. Thus diſguiſed, he led his phalanx againſt the Roman legions, and attacked them with incredible fury. Lævinus ſuſtained the ſhock with great reſolution, ſo that the victory was ſor many hours warmly diſputed. The Romans gave ſeveral times way to the Epirots, and the Epirots to the Romans ; but both parties rallied again, and were brought back to the charge by their commanders. Megacles, in the attire and helmet of Pyrrhus, was in all places, and well ſupported the character he had aſſumed. But his diſguiſe at laſt proved fatal to him : ſor a Roman knight, by name <hi rend="italic">Dexter, </hi>taking him for the king, followed him wherever he went ; and having found an opportunity of ditcharging a blow at him, ſtruck him dead on the ſpot, ſtripped him of his helmet and armour, and carried them in triumph to the conſul, who, by ſhowing to the Epirots the ſpoils of their king, ſo terrified them, that they began to give ground. But Pyrrhus, appearing bare-headed in the firſt files of his phalanx, and riding through all the lines, undeceived his men, and. inſpired them with new courage.</p><p>The advantage ſeemed to be pretty equal on both ſides, when Læyinus ordered his cavalry to advance ; which Pyrrhus obſerving, drew up 20 elephants in the front of his army, with towers on their backs full of bowmen. The very fight of thoſe dreadful animals chilled the bravery of the Romans, who had never before ſeen any. However, they ſtill advanced, till their horſes, not being able to bear the ſmell of them, and</p></body></text></TEI>
