<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>a</sup> New</span><span class="font0"> Principles of Gunnery,” containing the result of many experiments ; and a discourse being published in the&nbsp;Philosophical Transactions, in order to invalidate some of&nbsp;his opinions, he thought proper, in an account which he&nbsp;gave of his book in the same Transactions, to take notice&nbsp;of those experiments. In consequence of this discussion,&nbsp;several of bis Dissertations on the Resistance of Air were&nbsp;read, and the experiments exhibited before the Royal Society, for which he was presented by that honourable body&nbsp;with a gold medal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1748 appeared Lord Anson’s Voyage round the World, which, though Mr Walter’s name is in the title, has&nbsp;been generally thought to be the work of Robins. Walter,&nbsp;chaplain on board the Centurion, had brought it down to&nbsp;his departure from Macao for England, when he proposed&nbsp;to print the work by subscription. It was however, it is&nbsp;said, thought proper that an able judge should review and&nbsp;correct it, and Robins was appointed ; when, upon examination, it was resolved that the whole should be written by&nbsp;Robins, and that Walter’s papers should only serve as materials. Hence the introduction entire, and many dissertations in the body of the work, it is said, were composed&nbsp;by him, without receiving the least assistance from Walter’s&nbsp;manuscript, which chiefly related to the wind and the weather, the currents, courses, bearings, distances, the qualities&nbsp;of the ground on which they anchored, and such particulars&nbsp;as generally fill up a sailor’s account. No production of&nbsp;this kind ever met with a more favourable reception : four&nbsp;large impressions were sold within a twelvemonth ; and it&nbsp;has been translated into most of the languages of Europe.&nbsp;The fifth edition, prilled at London in 1749, was revised&nbsp;and corrected by Robins himself. In the corrigenda and&nbsp;addenda to the first volume of the Biographia Britannica,&nbsp;printed in the beginning of the fourth volume of that work,&nbsp;it is however stated that Robins was only consulted with&nbsp;respect to the disposition of the drawings, and that he had&nbsp;left England before the book was printed. Whether this&nbsp;be the fact, as it is asserted to be by the widow of Mr Walter, it is not for us to determine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Robins was soon afterwards desired to compose an apology for the unfortunate affair at Prestonpans. It was prefixed as a preface to “ The Report of the Proceedings of the Board of General Officers on their Examination into&nbsp;the conduct of Lieutenant-General Sir John Cope ;” and&nbsp;this preface was esteemed a masterpiece in its kind. He&nbsp;afterwards, through the interest of Lord Anson, contributed&nbsp;to the improvements made in the Royal Observatory at&nbsp;Greenwich. Having thus established his reputation, he&nbsp;was offered the choice of two considerable employments ;&nbsp;either to go to Paris as one of the commissaries for adjusting the limits of Acadia, or to be engineer-general to the&nbsp;East India Company. He chose the latter, and arrived in&nbsp;the East Indies in 1750 ; but the climate not agreeing with&nbsp;his constitution, he died there the year following.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROBINSON, Sir Richard, Lord Rokeby and archbishop of Armagh, was immediately descended from the Robinsons of Rokeby in the north riding of the county of York, and was born in 1709. He was educated at Westminster&nbsp;school, from whence he was elected to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1726. In 1783 he took the degree of A. M., and&nbsp;in 1748 that of D. D. Dr Blackburne, archbishop of York,&nbsp;appointed him his chaplain, and collated him first to the&nbsp;rectory of Elton in the east riding of Yorkshire, and next&nbsp;to the prebend of Grindall in the cathedral of York. In&nbsp;1751, he attended the duke of Dorset, lord-lieutenant of&nbsp;Ireland, to that kingdom, as his first chaplain, and the same&nbsp;year was promoted to the bishopric of Killala. A family&nbsp;connection with the earl of Holdernesse, secretary of state,&nbsp;with the earl of Sandwich and other noblemen related to&nbsp;him, opened the fairest prospects of attaining to the first&nbsp;dignity in the Irish church. Accordingly, in 1759 he was&nbsp;translated to the united sees of Leighlin and Ferns, and in&nbsp;1761 to Kildare. The duke of Northumberland being appointed to the lieutenancy of Ireland in 1765, he was advanced to the primacy of Armagh, made lord-almoner, and&nbsp;vice-chancellor of the university of Dublin. When Lord&nbsp;Harcourt was lord-lieutenant of Ireland in 1777, the king&nbsp;was pleased, by privy seal at St James’s, February 6th, and&nbsp;by patent at Dublin,the 26th of the same month, to create&nbsp;him Baron Rokeby of Armagh, with remainder to Matthew&nbsp;Robinson of West Layton, Esq.; and in 1783 he was appointed prelate of the most illustrious order of St Patrick.&nbsp;On the death of the duke of Rutland, lord-lieutenant of&nbsp;Ireland, in 1787, he was nominated one of the lords-justices&nbsp;of that kingdom. Sir William Robinson, his brother, dying&nbsp;in 1785, the primate succeeded to the title of baronet. He&nbsp;was the survivor in the direct male line of the Robinsons&nbsp;of Rokeby, being the eighth in descent from William of&nbsp;Kendal. His grace died at Clifton near Bristol in the end&nbsp;of October 1794.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROBISON, John, a distinguished professor of natural philosophy, born in 1739 at Boghall, in the parish of Bal-dernock and county of Stirling, was a younger son of John&nbsp;Robison, Esq. who had formerly been a merchant at Glasgow, and had retired to live in considerable affluence on&nbsp;bis estate at Boghall, not far from that city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He was of a family sufficiently respectable to enable his son at a subsequent period to prove himself, to the satisfaction of the court of St Petersburg, a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentleman</span><span class="font0"> born. As&nbsp;a younger brother, that son was originally intended for the&nbsp;church, and went at an early age, according to the custom&nbsp;of Scotland, in 1750, to enter as a student in the university&nbsp;of Glasgow, so that he was initiated almost in the rudimente&nbsp;of Grecian literature under the able instruction of Dr Moor,&nbsp;the well-known professor of Greek ; and he acquired such&nbsp;a knowledge of the classical languages as served to constitute him a correct scholar through life. He pursued his&nbsp;studies with so much attention as to obtain the approbation&nbsp;of his teachers and the admiration of his contemporaries,&nbsp;who were delighted with the originality and ingenuity of&nbsp;his conversation, though he did not himself reflect with perfect satisfaction upon the degree of application which he&nbsp;had exerted in his academical education. He took the degree of Master of Arts in 1756, having studied mathematics under Dr Robert Simson, and moral philosophy under&nbsp;Dr Adam Smith. The example of so correct and rigid a&nbsp;follower of the ancient methods of demonstration as Dr&nbsp;Simson, must unquestionably have exercised considerable&nbsp;influence on his yet unformed taste in mathematics ; but&nbsp;he seems to have had a natural preference, either from the&nbsp;constitution of his mind, or from some previously acquired&nbsp;habits of thinking, for the geometrical method ; for we are&nbsp;informed that </span><span class="font1">“ he </span><span class="font0">first attracted the regard of Dr Simson&nbsp;by owning his dislike of algebra, and by returning a neat&nbsp;geometrical solution of a problem which had been given&nbsp;out to the class in an algebraical form : with this mode of&nbsp;solution the professor was delighted, though the pupil candidly acknowledged that it had been adopted only because&nbsp;he could not solve the problem in the manner required of&nbsp;the class.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the course of his studies, he had imbibed an insuperable aversion to the pursuit of his original objects in the church ; not certainly from any want of religious feeling,&nbsp;or from a dislike to the kind of life that was intended for&nbsp;him, but probably from some difficulties that had occurred&nbsp;to him respecting particular points of doctrine or of practice. He was therefore compelled to provide himself with&nbsp;some other occupation ; and he readily accepted the offer&nbsp;of some of his friends in 1758, to recommend him to Dr&nbsp;Blair, a prebendary of Westminster, who had formed a&nbsp;scheme for sending Prince Edward, the young duke of&nbsp;York, to complete his professional education at sea, in com</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
