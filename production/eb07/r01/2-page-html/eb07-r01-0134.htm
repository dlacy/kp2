<p><span class="font0">Although we have hitherto treated of the common crocodile as one and distinct, yet it seems beyond doubt, that in the wide habitat assigned to it, many </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">varieties</span><span class="font0"> at least exist.&nbsp;Cuvier remarks, that from the Senegal to the Ganges, and&nbsp;even beyond it, there are crocodiles very like the common&nbsp;one, which have the muzzle somewhat longer or narrower,&nbsp;and have slight differences in the scales of their neck and&nbsp;back, but which it is very difficult to distribute into distinct&nbsp;species. He himself was not able to establish any ; nor could&nbsp;he with satisfaction adopt the four proposed by his eminent&nbsp;colleague M. Geoffroy, viz. C. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">suchus, marginatus, lacunosus,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">complαnatus.@@ <sup>1</sup></span><span class="font0"> Of these, by far the most famous&nbsp;is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">suchus,</span><span class="font0"> which the last-named naturalist considers&nbsp;identical with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sacred crocodile</span><span class="font0"> of the ancient Egyptians.&nbsp;His theory is, that there existed a species of a small size,&nbsp;having a narrow snout, and a disposition which was wholly&nbsp;gentle and inoffensive, which affected the margin of the&nbsp;river, and was thus the precursor of its inundations ; and&nbsp;that it was to this species that the Egyptians rendered divine honours. The opposing view, advocated by Cuvier, is&nbsp;that the favoured crocodile did not belong to any one species&nbsp;or variety more than another, and, far from being less, was&nbsp;even more ferocious ; but that it was the custom of the&nbsp;priesthood to entertain, not a host of crocodiles, but only&nbsp;one, or a few, of any given variety, under the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">souchis,</span><span class="font0"> as the idol of a divinity who was represented by a&nbsp;crocodile’s head ; and that it was to this individual especially that divine honours were paid, in the same way as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">apis</span><span class="font0"> was the name of the sacred ox at Memphis, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mnevis&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">at Heliopolis. This favoured animal was always nourished&nbsp;and adorned with extreme splendour, and after its death&nbsp;was buried in the subterranean cells of the Labyrinth ;&nbsp;whilst throughout the district where these honours were&nbsp;paid, the whole race of crocodiles were respected and preserved. Cuvier assigns the following among other reasons&nbsp;for the accuracy of his views, which we think conclusive : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">First,</span><span class="font0"> the crania of the buried and embalmed crocodiles do not belong to any one variety, but to all of them ;&nbsp;and, 2</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dly,</span><span class="font0"> there is the strongest historical proof that the&nbsp;crocodiles in those districts where they were worshipped,&nbsp;far from being less savage, were even more so than in&nbsp;others, because from their impunity they became more&nbsp;bold. Thus Ælian reports, that in the district of Tyntyri-tcs, whcre they unsparingly destroyed the crocodiles, the&nbsp;inhabitants could bathe and swim in the river securely,&nbsp;whilst at Arsinoe they could not safely walk, far less draw&nbsp;water from the river’s banks. The evidence that individuals, when taken young, may be completely tamed, is equally satisfactory. Thus Bruce relates, that on the western&nbsp;shores of Africa, the negroes bring up crocodiles, which become so gentle as to let children play with them and ride&nbsp;upon their backs ; a fact which satisfactorily corroborates&nbsp;the accounts of those religious processions, &amp;c. in which the&nbsp;sacred crocodile performed so essential and conspicuous a&nbsp;part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">C. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">biporcatus,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv. Dum ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. porosus,</span><span class="font0"> Schn. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Double crested crocodile.</span><span class="font0"> This species is the common crocodile of&nbsp;India and its archipelago, frequenting the Ganges and other&nbsp;great rivers which empty themselves into the ocean, as also&nbsp;those of Corea and China, Ceylon, Java, Timor, &amp;c. It has a&nbsp;strong resemblance to the Egyptian species ; but the cervical&nbsp;scales are differently arranged, and the dorsal are smaller, more&nbsp;numerous, and differently shaped. (See Plate CCCCXXX.&nbsp;fig. 6.) Thc appearance of the pores between the scales is&nbsp;much more conspicuous than in the other species, and grows&nbsp;with their growth. Its colour is brownish, with black bands&nbsp;on the back, and spots on the side. In the Paris museum&nbsp;there is one seventeen feet long, from the Ganges. In the&nbsp;account of Macassar, or Celebes, we read, that in the great&nbsp;river of that island, there are crocodiles so ferocious that&nbsp;they do not confine themselves to making war on fish, but&nbsp;assemble in troops to watch the boats, and endeavour to&nbsp;overturn them, that they may devour those who are in&nbsp;them. It is the opinion in Java that these animals do not&nbsp;devour their prey on capturing it ; but bury it for a time&nbsp;in the mud, that it may decay. This remark is so generally made of other species in different parts of the world, that&nbsp;it would appear to bc a prevailing habit among them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">C. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">acutus,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv. Dum. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The slender-snouted crocodile,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">crocodile of St Domingo.</span><span class="font0"> This slender-snouted crocodile&nbsp;is extremely common in the island of St Domingo, as well&nbsp;as in Martinique, and the northern parts of South America.&nbsp;Its most remarkable specific characters are the length of&nbsp;the muzzle, which is bulged at its base ; and the scales of&nbsp;the back are differently disposed from those of the preceding. The upper part of the body is of a deep green&nbsp;colour, spotted and marbled with black ; the under part is&nbsp;pale green. Dr Descourtils states that this animal is more&nbsp;flexible than is usually supposed, for it can introduce the&nbsp;extremity of its tail into its mouth. On the same respectable authority we learn that the males are not so numerous&nbsp;as the females ; that they fight furiously at the season of&nbsp;reproduction ; that the males are fit for generation at the&nbsp;age of ten, and the females at that of eight or nine, their&nbsp;fecundity not lasting more than four or five years,—a&nbsp;statement which may well be questioned. The eggs are&nbsp;deposited in spring, and hatched in a month. On issuing,&nbsp;the young are only nine or ten inches long ; their growth&nbsp;continues for about twenty years, and some are as long as&nbsp;sixteen feet. At the time of the escape of the young, the&nbsp;female comes to scrape away the earth and let them out.&nbsp;She conducts, defends, and feeds them, by disgorging her&nbsp;own food for about three months, a space of time during&nbsp;which the male would seek to devour them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. rhombifer,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv. Dum. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lozenge-scaled crocodile. </span><span class="font0">The habitat of this species has been ascertained only of late&nbsp;years. It occurs in the island of Cuba, and probably inhabits the other Antilles. Its specific characters are well&nbsp;marked. Its chanfrin is extremely prominent, forming a semicircle, whilst in the common crocodile it is only a gentle&nbsp;elevation ; and the extremities are clad with much stronger&nbsp;and more projecting scales than in the other species. Its&nbsp;ground colour is green, bespeckled with small and very distinct brown spots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">C. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">galeatus,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv. Dum. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Helmeted crocodile.</span><span class="font0"> The helmeted crocodile has been hitherto found only in Siam,&nbsp;and is remarkable for two bony triangular crests implanted,&nbsp;the one behind, the other on the middle line of the head.&nbsp;It has been taken ten feet long. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. biscutatus</span><span class="font0"> is now regarded as an anomalous variety of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">C. acutus. C. cataphractus,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cuiirassed crocodile,</span><span class="font0"> may be witnessed in the&nbsp;museum of the London Royal College of Surgeons, and it&nbsp;is very different, according to Cuvier, from all the others&nbsp;described. The source from whence it was obtained is&nbsp;unknown.@@<sup>2</sup> Its muzzle is longer and narrower than that of&nbsp;the St Domingo crocodile, whose peculiar chanfrin it wants.&nbsp;It is most easily distinguished by the armour on its neck ;&nbsp;there are first two oval plates, then a row of four, then scaly&nbsp;bands common to the neck and back, which together form&nbsp;a cuirass as strong as that of any of the gavials or alligators.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1 </sup>These seem all to be now regarded as varieties of the common Egyptian crocodile,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C. vulgaris,</span><span class="font1"> Cuv. and Dum. See </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Erpétologie Générale,</span><span class="font1"> iii. 104.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@ <sup>2</sup> A specimen of a young individual was presented to the Paris museum as having been obtained from “ le grand Galbac, rivière qui coule près de Sierra de Leone.&quot;</span></p>
