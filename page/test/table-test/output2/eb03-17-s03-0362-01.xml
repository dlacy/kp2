the name of certain iſlands belonging to Scotland, and lying to the northward of Orkney. There are many convincing proofs that theſe iſlands were very early inhabited by the Picts, or rather by thoſe nations who were the original poſſeſſors of the Orkneys ; and at the time of the total deſtruction of theſe nations, if any credit be due to tradition, their woods were entirely ruined<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> The tradition is, that this was done by the Scots when they deſtroyed the Picts ; but is more probably referred to the Norwegians rooting out the original poſſessors of Shetland.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi> It is highly probable that the people in Shetland, as well as in the Orkneys, flouriſhed under their own princes dependent upon the crown of Norway ; yet this ſeems to have been rather through what they acquired by fiſhing and commerce, than by the cultivation of their lands. It may also be reaſonably preſumed, that they grew thinner of inhabitants after they were annexed to the crown of Scotland; and it is likely that they revived again, chiefly by the very great and extenſive improvements which the Dutch made in the herring-fiſhery upon their coaſts, and the trade that the crews of their busses, then very numerous, carried on with the inhabitants, necessarily reſulting from their want of provisions and other conveniences, which in thoſe days could not be very conſiderable.</p><p>There are many reaſons which may be aſſigned why theſe iſlands, though part of our dominions, have not hitherto been better known to us. They were commonly placed two degrees too far to the north in all the old maps, in order to make them agree with Ptolemy’s deſcription of Thule, which he asserted to be in the latitude of 63 degrees ; which we find urged by Camden as a reaſon why Thule must be one of the Shetland iſles, to which Speed alſo agrees, though from their being thus wrong placed he could not find room for them in his maps. Another, and that no light cauſe, was the many falſe, fabulous, and impertinent relations publiſhed concerning them<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi> They repreſented the climate as intenſely cold ; the ſoil as compoſed of crags and quagmire, ſo barren as to be incapable of bearing corn ; to ſupply which, the people, after drying fiſh-bones, powdered them, then kneaded and baked them for bread. The larger fiſh-bones were ſaid to be all the fuel they had. Yet, in ſo dreary a country, and in ſuch miſerable circumſtances, they were acknowledged to be very long-lived, cheerful, and contented.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(b),</hi> as if they were countries inhoſpitable and uninhabitable ; and laſtly, the indolence, or rather indifference, of the natives, who, contenting<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0369.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0363"/>
themſelves with thoſe neceſſaries and conveniences procured by their intercourse with other nations, and conceiving themſelves neglected by the mother country, have ſeldom troubled her with their applications.</p><p>There are, few countries that have gone by more names than theſe iſlands; they were called in Islandic, <hi rend="italic">Hialtlandia,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">hialt,</hi> the “ hilt of a ſword ;” the might be poſſibly corrupted into <hi rend="italic">Hetland, Hitland,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Hethland,</hi> though ſome tell us this ſignifies a “ high land.” They have been likewiſe, and are ſtill in ſome maps, called <hi rend="italic">Zetland</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Zealand,</hi> in reference, as has been ſuppoſed, to their ſituation. By the Danes, and by the natives, they are ſtyled <hi rend="italic">Tealtaland ;</hi> and not- withſtanding the oddneſs of the orthography, this differs very little, if at all, from their manner of pronouncing Zetland, out of which pronunciation grew the modern names of <hi rend="italic">Shetland</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Shotland.</hi></p><p>The iſlands of <hi rend="italic">Shetland,</hi> as we commonly call them, are well ſituated for trade. The neareſt continent to them is Norway ; the port of Bergen lying 44 leagues eaſt, whereas they lie 46 leagues north north-eaſt from Buchanneſs ; eaſt north-eaſt from Sanda, one of the Orkneys, about 16 or 18 leagues ; six or ſeven leagues north-eaſt from Fair Iſle ; 58 leagues eaſt from the Ferroe iſles ; and at nearly the same diſtance north-eaſt from Lewis. The ſouthern promontory of the main land, called <hi rend="italic">Sumburgh Head, lies</hi> in 59 degrees and 59 minutes of north latitude ; and the northern extremity of Unſt, the most remote of them all, in the latitude of 61 degrees 15 minutes. The meridian of London paſſes through this laſt iſland, which lies about 2 degrees 30 minutes west from Paris, and about 5 degrees 15 minutes eaſt from the meridian of Cape Lizard. According to Gifford’s “ Hiſtorical Deſcription pf Zetland,” the inhabited iſlands are 33, of which the principal is ſtyled <hi rend="italic">Main Land,</hi> and extends in length from north to ſouth about 60 miles, and is in ſome places 20 broad, though in others not more than two.</p><p>It is impoſſible to ſpeak with preciſion ; but, according to the beſt computation which we have been able to form, the Shetland iſles contain near three times as much land as the Orkneys : they are conſidered alſo as equal in ſize to the iſland of Madeira ; and not inferior to the provinces of Utrecht, Zealand, and all the reſt of the Dutch iſlands taken together ; but of climate and soil they have not much to boaſt. The longeſt day in the iſland of Unſt is 19 hours 15 minutes, and of conſequence the ſhorteſt day 4 hours and 45 minutes. The ſpring is very late, the ſummer very ſhort ; the autumn alſo is of no long duration, dark, foggy, and rainy ; the winter ſets in about November, and laſts till April, and ſometimes till May. They have frequently in that ſeaſon ſtorms of thunder, much rain, but little froſt or ſnow. High winds are indeed very frequent and very troubleſome, yet they ſeldom produce any terrible effects. The aurora borealis is as common here as in any of the northern countries. In the winter ſeaſon the ſea ſwells and rages in ſuch a manner, that for five or six months their ports are inacceſſible, and of courſe the people during that ſpace have no correſpondence with the reſt of the world.</p><p>The soil in the interior part of the main land, for the moſt part, is mountainous, mooriſh, and boggy, yet not to ſuch a degree as to render the country utterly impaſſable ; for many of the roads here, and in ſome of the northern iſles, are as good as any other natural roads, and the people travel them frequently on all occasions. Near the coaſt there are ſometimes for milestogether flat pleaſant ſpots, very fertile both in paſture and corn. The mountains produce large crops of very nutritive grass in the ſummer ; and they cut conſiderable quantities of hay, with which they feed their cattle in the winter. They might with a little attention bring more of their country into cultivation : but the people are ſo much addicted to their fiſhery, and feel ſo little neceſſity of having recourſe to this method for ſubſiſtence, that they are content, how ſtrange ſoever that may ſeem to us, to let four parts in five of their land remain in a ſtate of nature.</p><p>They want not considerable quantities of marle in different iſlands, though they uſe but little ; hitherto there has Been no chalk found ; limeſtone and freeſtone there are in the ſouthern parts of the main land in great quantities, and alſo in the neighbouring iſlands, particularly Fetlar ; and considerable quantities of ſlate, very good in its kind. No mines have been hitherto wrought, though there are in many places visible appearances of ſeveral kinds of metal. Some ſolid pieces of ſilver, it is said, have been turned up by the plough. In ſome of the ſmaller iſles there are ſtrong appearances of iron ; but, through the want of proper experiments being made, there is, in this reſpect at leaſt, hitherto nothing certain. Their meadows are incloſed with dikes, and produce very good graſs. The little corn they grow is chiefly barley, with ſome oats ; though even in the northern extremity of Unſt the little land which they have is remarkable for its fertility. The hills abound with medicinal herbs ; and their kitchen-gardens thrive as well, and produce as good greens and roots, as any in Britain. Of late years, and since this has been attended to, ſome gentlemen have had even greater ſucceſs than they expected in the cultivating of tulips, roſes, and many other flowers. They have no trees, and hardly any ſhrubs except juniper, yet they have a tradition that their country was formerly overgrown with woods ; and it ſeems to be a confirmation of this, that the roots of timber-trees have been, and are ſtill, dug up at a great depth ; and that in ſome, and thoſe too inacceſſible, places, the mountain aſh is ſtill found growing wild. That this defect, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> the want of wood at preſent, does not ariſe entirely from the soil or climate, appears from ſeveral late experiments ; ſome gentlemen having raiſed aſh, maple, horſecheſnuts, &amp; c. in their gardens. Though the inhabitants are without either wood or coals, they are very well ſupplied with fuel, having great plenty of heath and peat. The black cattle in this country are in general of a larger fort than in Orkney, which is owing to their having more extensive paſtures ; a clear proof that ſtill farther improvements might be made in reſpect to ſize. Their horſes are ſmall, but ſtrong, ſtout, and well ſhaped, live very hardy, and to a great age. They have likewiſe a breed of ſmall ſwine, the fleſh of which, when fat, is eſteemed very delicious. They have no goats, hares, or foxes ; and in general no wild or venomous creatures of any kind except rats in ſome few iſlands. They have no moor-fowl, which is the more remarkable, as there are everywhere immenſe quantities of heath ; but there are many forts of wild and water fowl, particularly the dunter-gooſe, clack-gooſe, solan-gooſe, ſwans,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0370.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0364"/>
ducks, teal, whaps, foists, lyres, kittiwaiks, maws, plovers, cormorants, &amp; c. There is likewiſe the ember-gooſe, which is ſaid to hatch her egg under her wing. Eagles and hawks, as alſo ravens, crows, mews,&amp; c. abound here.</p><p>All theſe iſlands are well watered ; for there are everywhere excellent ſprings, ſome of them mineral and medicinal. They have indeed no rivers ; but many pleaſant rills or rivulets, which they call <hi rend="italic">burns,</hi> of different ſizes ; in ſome of the largeſt they have admirable trouts, ſome of which are of 15 and even of 20 pounds weight. They have likewiſe many freſh-water lakes, well ſtored with trout and eels, and in most of them there are alſo large and fine flounders ; in ſome very excellent cod. Theſe freſh water lakes, if the country was better peopled, and the common people more at their eaſe, are certainly capable of great improvements. The ſea- coaſts of the main land of Shetland, in a ſtraight line, are 55 leagues ; and therefore there cannot be a country conceived more proper for eſtabliſhing an extenſive fiſhery. What the inhabitants have been hitherto able to do, their natural advantages conſidered, does not deserve that name, notwithſtanding they export large quantities of cod, tuſk, ling, and slate, inſomuch that the bounty allowed by acts of parliament amounts from L. 1400 to L. 2000 annually. They have, beſides, haddocks, whitings, turbot, and a variety of other fish. In many of the inlets there are prodigious quantities of excellent oyſters, lobſters, muſcles, cockles, and other ſhell-fiſh. As to amphibious creatures, they have multitudes of otters and ſeals ; add to theſe, that amber, ambergris, and other ſpoils of the ocean, are frequently found upon the coaſts.</p><p>The inhabitants are a ſtout, well-made, comely people ; the lower sort of a ſwarthy complexion. The gentry are allowed, by all who have converſed, with them, to be moſt of them polite, ſhrewd, ſenſible, lively, active, and intelligent perſons ; and theſe, to the number of 100 families, have very handſome, ſtrong, well-built houſes, neatly furniſhed ; their tables well ſerved, poliſhed in their manners, and exceedingly hoſpitable and civil to ſtrangers. Thoſe of an inferior rank are a hardy, rebuff, and laborious people, who, generally ſpeaking, get their bread by fiſhing in all weathers in their yawls, which are little bigger than Graveſend wherries ; live hardily, and in the ſummer seaſon moſtly on fiſh ; their drink, which, in reference to the British dominions, is peculiar to the country, is called <hi rend="italic">bland,</hi> apd is a sort of butter-milk, long kept, and very sour. Many live to great ages, though not ſo long as in former times. In reſpect, however, to the bulk of the inhabitants, from the poorneſs of living, from the nature of it, and from the drinking great quantities of corn-ſpirits of the very worſt sort, multitudes are afflicted with an inveterate ſcurvy ; from which thoſe in better circumſtances are entirely free, and enjoy as good health as in any other country in Europe. As they have no great turn to agriculture, and are perſuaded that their country is not fit for it, they do not (though probably they might) raiſe corn enough to ſupport them for more than two-thirds of the year. But they are much more ſucceſsful in their paſture-grounds, which are kept well incloſed, in good order, and, together with their commons, supply them plentifully with beef and mutton. They pay their</p><p>rents generally in butter at Lammas, and in money at Martinmas. As to manufactures, they make a strong coarſe cloth for their own uſe, as alſo linen. They make likewiſe of their own wool very fine ſtockings. They export, beſides the different kinds of fiſh already mentioned, ſome herrings, a conſiderable quantity of butter and train-oil, otter and ſeal ſkins,and no inconſiderable quantity of the fine ſtockings just mentioned. Their chief trade is to Leith, London, Hamburgh, Spain, and to the Straits. They import timbers, deals, and ſome of their beſt oats, from Norway ; corn and flour from the Orkneys, and from North Britain ; ſpirits and ſome other things from Hamburgh ; cloths and better sort of linen from Leith ; grocery, houſehold furniture, and other neceſſaries, from London. The ſuperior-duties to the earl of Morton are generally let in farm ; and are paid by the people in butter, oil, and money. The remains of the old Norwegian conſtitution are ſtill viſible in the diviſion of their lands ; and they have ſome udalmen or freeholders amongſt them. But the Scots laws, cuſtoms, manners, dreſs, and language, prevail ; and they have a ſheriff, and other magiſtrates for the adminiſtration of juſtice, as well as a cuſtomhouſe, with a proper number of officers. In reference to their eccleſiaſtical concerns, they have a preſbytery, 12 miniſters, and an itinerant for Foula, Fair Island, and the Skerries. Each of theſe miniſters has a ſtipend of between 40 and 50 pounds, beſides a houſe and a glebe free from taxes·. The number of ſouls in theſe iſlands may be about 20,0c0.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SHEW-bread,</hi> the loaves of bread which the prieſt of the week put every Sabbath-day upon the golden- table in the ſanctuary, before the Lord, in the temple of the Jews. They were twelve in number, and were offered to God in the name of the twelve tribes of Iſrael. They were ſhaped like a brick, were ten palms long and five broad, weighing about eight pounds each. They were unleavened, and made of fine flour by the Levites. The prieſts ſet them on. the table in two rows, six in a row, and put frankincenſe upon them to preſerve them from moulding. They were changed every Sabbath, and the old ones belonged to the prieſt upon duty. Of this bread none but the prieſts might eat, except in caſes of neceſſity. It was called the <hi rend="italic">bread of faces,</hi> becauſe the table of the ſhew-bread, being almoſt over- againſt the ark of the covenant, the loaves might be ſaid to be ſet before the face of God. The original table was carried away to Babylon, but a new one was made for the second temple. It was of wood overlaid with gold. This, with the candleſtick and ſome other ſpoils, was carried by Titus to Rome.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
