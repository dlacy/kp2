Thus according to the grouping of 1871 the rural population of 1871 was nearly 28,000 less than the rural population of 1861 according to the grouping of 1861. It is from the villages and small towns that the large towns are principally recruited, the purely rural population preferring as a rule to emigrate.</p><p>Table V. shows the nationalities of the people of Scotland in 1871 and 1881, with the nationalities in 1881 in those burghs which had a population of 10,000 and upwards:—</p><table><row><cell>Nationalities.</cell><cell cols="2">Scotland 1871.</cell><cell cols="2">Scotland 1881.</cell><cell cols="2">Burghs 1881.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Number.</cell><cell>Percentage to Pop.</cell><cell>Number.</cell><cell>Percentage to Pop.</cell><cell>Number.</cell><cell>Percentage to Pop.</cell></row><row><cell>Scots 	</cell><cell>3,061,531</cell><cell>91∙117</cell><cell>3,397,759</cell><cell>90·957</cell><cell>1,429,012</cell><cell>87·116</cell></row><row><cell>Irish 	</cell><cell>207,770</cell><cell>6∙184</cell><cell>218,745</cell><cell>5·856</cell><cell>141,626</cell><cell>8·634</cell></row><row><cell>English	</cell><cell>69,401</cell><cell>2∙065</cell><cell>90,017</cell><cell>2·410</cell><cell>51,402</cell><cell>3·134</cell></row><row><cell>British colonials..</cell><cell>9,740</cell><cell>0∙290</cell><cell>12,874</cell><cell>0·345</cell><cell>7,768</cell><cell>0·473</cell></row><row><cell>British subjects from abroad ....</cell><cell>5,068</cell><cell>0·151</cell><cell>7,024</cell><cell>0·188</cell><cell>4,954</cell><cell>0·254</cell></row><row><cell>Foreigners 	</cell><cell>4,698</cell><cell>0∙140</cell><cell>6,399</cell><cell>0·171</cell><cell>4,171</cell><cell>0·302</cell></row><row><cell>Welsh	</cell><cell>1,081</cell><cell>0·032</cell><cell>1,806</cell><cell>0∙048</cell><cell>8S2</cell><cell>0·054</cell></row><row><cell>From Channel Isles</cell><cell>729</cell><cell>0·021</cell><cell>949</cell><cell>0·025</cell><cell>545</cell><cell>0·033</cell></row><row><cell>Totals 	</cell><cell>3,360,018</cell><cell>100·000</cell><cell>3,735,573</cell><cell>100·000</cell><cell>1,640,360</cell><cell>100·000</cell></row></table><p>This table indicates not merely an actual but a proportional increase in non-natives, there being an actual increase but a proportional decrease of natives of Ireland, and both an actual and a proportional increase of natives of England. Over the whole of Scotland the proportion of non-natives is a little over 9 per cent., while in the burghs it is nearly 13 per cent. The number of persons of Scottish birth in Ireland in 1881 was 22,328, and in England it was 253,528,— a total in the two countries of 275,856. On the other hand, the natives of the two countries in Scotland in 1881 were together 308,762, so that there is a smaller migration from Scotland to these countries than from these countries to Scotland.</p><p>The following table (VI.) shows the emigration of persons of Scottish origin from the United Kingdom at various periods since 1853 :—</p><table><row><cell>Years ....</cell><cell>1853-55</cell><cell>1856-60</cell><cell>1861-65</cell><cell>1866-70</cell><cell>1871-75</cell><cell>1876-80</cell><cell>1881-85</cell><cell>1853-85</cell></row><row><cell>Emigrants</cell><cell>62,514</cell><cell>59,016</cell><cell>62,461</cell><cell>85,621</cell><cell>95,055</cell><cell>70,596</cell><cell>133,527</cell><cell>568,790</cell></row></table><p>Comparing 1856-60 with 1881-85 it will be seen that the number of emigrants has more than doubled,—an increase of course proportionately much greater than the population. There are no statistics as to the number of immigrants into Scotland ; and the significance of Table VI. is further lessened by the fact that it includes persons who may have been for some time resident in England or Ireland, or who may have been born there of Scottish parentage, and also supplies no information regarding emigration to the Continent. Only the principal ports, moreover, are included in the return.</p><p>The male population in 1881 was 1,799,475, an increase since 1871 of 12·2 per cent. ; the female population 1,936,098, an increase of only 10·2 per cent. Since 1811, when there were 118·5 females to every 100 males, the proportion has been continuously diminishing, and in 1881 it was 107·6, but still greater than prevails either in England, which was 105·5, or in Ireland, which was 104·3. The proportion differs greatly in different counties, being as high as 134·71 in Shetland, chiefly on account of the number of males at sea. In Scotland the proportion of female births is smaller than that of male births: in 1885 it was 100 to 105; and males preponderate in the population up till the age of twenty-five, clearly showing that the excess of females is due to male emigration or the greater mortality of male occupations. The percentage</p><p>of illegitimate to the total number of births in 1855 was 7·8, and reached its maximum in 1865, when it was 10·2, while in 1885 it was 8·46. It is much higher in the lowland rural districts than in the Highland rural districts, and lowest in the large towns. The percentages of births, deaths, and marriages to population in the annual reports of the registrar-general are in a great degree misleading, inasmuch as the estimated population generally differs greatly from the actual. They place it, however, beyond doubt that the greatest birth, marriage, and mortality rates are in the town districts, that the smallest birth and marriage rates are in the insular districts, after which come the mainland rural districts, and that the mortality is not so high in the insular rural as in the mainland rural districts. Table VII. (see below) gives the percentage of single, married, and widowed to the total of each sex in Scotland, England and Wales, and Ireland respectively in 1881.</p><p>The number of blind persons in Scotland in 1881 was 3158 (males 1556, females 1602), the proportion to the total population being 1 in 1182 (males 1156, females 1208) ; the proportion in 1871 was 1 in 1112. The deaf and dumb in 1881 numbered 2142 (males 1149, females 993), the proportion to the total population being 1 in every 1744 as against 1 in every 1610 in 1871. The number of lunatics was returned as 8406 (males 3939, females 4467) or 1 in every 444 of the total population, the proportion in 1871 being 1 in every 494. In addition to this there were 5991 imbeciles (males 2896, females 3095), or 1 to every 623 of the population, the proportion in 1871 being 1 in every 727.</p><p>Table VIII. gives a classification of the population according to occupations in 1871 and 1881 :—</p><table><row><cell/><cell>Classes of Occupation.</cell><cell>1871.</cell><cell>1881.</cell><cell cols="2">Per cent. of Total Pop.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell>1871.</cell><cell>1881.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>1.

The increase in the proportion of the professional and commercial classes is at least a slight indication of higher average prosperity, but this is more conclusively established by the fact that the number of paupers has for many years been steadily on the decline, the proportion being now (1886) only 2·4 of the population. The average cost of maintenance is, however, on the increase, owing entirely to the increased cost of the maintenance of the lunatic poor.</p><p>Crime, like pauperism, is also steadily declining, as is shown by Table IX.</p><table><row><cell>Offences.</cell><cell cols="4">Average.</cell><cell cols="2">1884.</cell><cell>Total.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell><p>1836-</p><p>40.</p></cell><cell><p>1851-</p><p>55.</p></cell><cell><p>1875-</p><p>79.</p></cell><cell><p>1880-</p><p>84.</p></cell><cell>Males.</cell><cell>Females.</cell><cell/></row><row><cell>Against person	</cell><cell>751</cell><cell>1014</cell><cell>881</cell><cell>838</cell><cell>905</cell><cell>75</cell><cell>980</cell></row><row><cell>Against property with violence Against property without vio-</cell><cell>530</cell><cell>532</cell><cell>520</cell><cell>524</cell><cell>515</cell><cell>80</cell><cell>595</cell></row><row><cell>lence 	</cell><cell>1676</cell><cell>1916</cell><cell>1102</cell><cell>930</cell><cell>649</cell><cell>262</cell><cell>911</cell></row><row><cell>Against property, malicious..</cell><cell>47</cell><cell>62</cell><cell>122</cell><cell>89</cell><cell>52</cell><cell>8</cell><cell>60</cell></row><row><cell>Forgery, &amp;c	</cell><cell>120</cell><cell>109</cell><cell>44</cell><cell>4S</cell><cell>36</cell><cell>6</cell><cell>42</cell></row><row><cell>Other offences 	</cell><cell>266</cell><cell>247</cell><cell>112</cell><cell>122</cell><cell>82</cell><cell>7</cell><cell>89</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>3390</cell><cell>3880</cell><cell>2781</cell><cell>2551</cell><cell>2239</cell><cell>438</cell><cell>2677</cell></row></table><table><row><cell cols="13"><hi rend="smallcaps">Table</hi> IV.</cell></row><row><cell>Groups.</cell><cell cols="2">Population according to Grouping in 1861.</cell><cell cols="2">Population according to Grouping in 1871.</cell><cell><p>Births</p><p>1861-71.</p></cell><cell><p>Deaths</p><p>1861-71.</p></cell><cell><p>Births</p><p>1871-81.</p></cell><cell><p>Deaths</p><p>1871-81.</p></cell><cell cols="2">Increase or Decrease from 1861 to 1871.</cell><cell cols="2">Increase or Decrease from 1871 to 1881.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>1861.</cell><cell>1871.</cell><cell>1871.</cell><cell>1881.</cell><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell/><cell>Actual.</cell><cell>Excess of Births over Deaths.</cell><cell>Actual.</cell><cell>Excess of Births over Deaths.</cell></row><row><cell><p>Principal towns ....</p><p>Large towns 	</p><p>Small towns 	</p><p>Rural districts ....</p><p>Scotland 	</p></cell><cell><p>884,955</p><p>254,030</p><p>502,833</p><p>1,420,476</p></cell><cell><p>1,068,556</p><p>310,165</p><p>540,807</p><p>1,440,490</p></cell><cell><p>1,193,940</p><p>327,734</p><p>696,958</p><p>1,141,386</p></cell><cell><p>1,411,536</p><p>388,797</p><p>790,796</p><p>1,144,444</p></cell><cell><p>376,856</p><p>103,519</p><p>190,128</p><p>450,288</p></cell><cell><p>274,511</p><p>68,769</p><p>115,147</p><p>247,769</p></cell><cell><p>429,679</p><p>150,095</p><p>293,220</p><p>361,357</p></cell><cell><p>296,285</p><p>94,498</p><p>171,485</p><p>203,200</p></cell><cell>+183,601 + 56,135 + 37,974 + 20,014</cell><cell>+102,345 + 34,750 + 74,981 +202,519</cell><cell>+217,596 + 61,063 + 93,838 +	3,058</cell><cell>+133,394 + 55,597 + 121,735 +158,157</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>3,062,294</cell><cell>3,360,018</cell><cell>3,360,018</cell><cell>3,735,573</cell><cell>1,120,791</cell><cell>706,196</cell><cell>1,234,351</cell><cell cols="2">765,468  +297,724</cell><cell>+ 414,595</cell><cell>+375,555</cell><cell>+468,883</cell></row></table><table><row><cell cols="10"><hi rend="smallcaps">Table</hi> VII.</cell></row><row><cell>Sexes.</cell><cell/><cell>Scotland.</cell><cell/><cell cols="3">England and Wales.</cell><cell/><cell>Ireland.</cell><cell/></row><row><cell/><cell>Single.</cell><cell>Maιτied.</cell><cell>Widowed.</cell><cell>Single.</cell><cell>Married.</cell><cell>Widowed.</cell><cell>Single.</cell><cell>Married.</cell><cell>Widowed.</cell></row><row><cell>Males 	</cell><cell>66∙281</cell><cell>30·441</cell><cell>3·278</cell><cell>61·932</cell><cell>34·628</cell><cell>3·440</cell><cell>68·714</cell><cell>27·501</cell><cell>3·785</cell></row><row><cell>Females 	</cell><cell>62·854</cell><cell>28·957</cell><cell>8·189</cell><cell>59·226</cell><cell>33·282</cell><cell>7·492</cell><cell>63*442</cell><cell>26·976</cell><cell>9·582</cell></row></table></body></text></TEI>
