<p><span class="font0">which fifty-five was fixed as the number of the society,—persons of the degree of baron, Fellows of the College of Physicians, and public professors of mathematics, physics and natural&nbsp;philosophy of both universities being supernumeraries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Gresham College was now appointed to be the regular meeting-place of the society. Sir Robert Moray (or Murray)&nbsp;was chosen president (March 6, 1661), and continued from time&nbsp;to time to occupy the chair until the incorporation of the&nbsp;society, when Lord Brouncker was appointed the first president&nbsp;under the charter. In October 1661 the king offered to be&nbsp;entered one of the society, and next year the society was incorporated under its present title. The name “ Royal Society ”&nbsp;appears to have been first applied to the Philosophers by John&nbsp;Evelyn, in the dedication of his translation of a book by Gabriel&nbsp;Naud6, published in 1661. Evelyn received in that year the&nbsp;thanks of the “ philosophic assembly ” for the honourable&nbsp;mention he had made of them by the name of “ The Royal&nbsp;Society.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The charter of incorporation passed the Great Seal on the 15th of July 1662, to be modified, however, by a second charter&nbsp;in the following year, repeating the incorporating clauses of the&nbsp;first charter, but conferring further privileges on the society.&nbsp;The second charter passed the Great Seal on the 22nd of April&nbsp;1663, and was followed in 1669 by a third, confirming the powers&nbsp;granted by the second charter, with some modifications of detail,&nbsp;and granting certain lands in Chelsea to the society. The&nbsp;council of the Royal Society met for the first time on the 13 th&nbsp;of May 1663, when resolutions were passed that debate concerning those to be admitted should be secret, and that Fellows&nbsp;should pay is. a week to defray expenses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At this early stage of its history the “ correspondence ” which was actively maintained with* continental philosophers&nbsp;formed an important part of the society’s labours, and selections from this correspondence furnished the beginnings of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions</span><span class="font0"> (a publication now of world-wide&nbsp;celebrity). At first the publication of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Transactions</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;entirely “ the act of the respective secretaries.” The first&nbsp;number, consisting of 16 quarto pages, appeared on Monday,&nbsp;March 6, 1664-65, under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions: giving some Accompt of the present undertakings,&nbsp;studies and labours of the Ingenious in many considerable&nbsp;parts of the world,</span><span class="font0"> with a dedication to the Royal Society&nbsp;signed by Henry Oldenburg, the first secretary of the society.&nbsp;It was ordered (1st of March 1664-65) “ that the tract be&nbsp;licensed by the Council of the Society, being first reviewed&nbsp;by some of the members of the same.” In 1750, 496 numbers,&nbsp;or 46 volumes, had been published. After this date the work&nbsp;was issued under the superintendence of a committee, and the&nbsp;division into numbers disappeared. The society also from its&nbsp;earliest years published, or directed the publication of, separate&nbsp;treatises and books on matters of philosophy; most notable&nbsp;among these being the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophiae naturalis principia&nbsp;mathematica Autore Is. Newton. Imprimatur: S. Pepys,&nbsp;Reg. Soc. Praeses. Julii</span><span class="font0"> 5, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">1686, 4I0 Londini 1687.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1887 the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions</span><span class="font0"> was divided into two series, labelled A and B respectively, the former containing&nbsp;papers of a mathematical or physical character, and the latter&nbsp;papers of a biological character. More than 225 quarto volumes&nbsp;have been published. In 1832 appeared the first volume of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Abstracts of papers printed in the Philosophical Transactions&nbsp;from the year 1800.</span><span class="font0"> This publication developed in the course&nbsp;of a few years into the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Proceedings of the Royal Society,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;has been continued up to the present time. It is published&nbsp;now in two series, corresponding to the two series of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Philosophical Transactions,</span><span class="font0"> and is issued in 8vo form at the rate of&nbsp;about three volumes a year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is, however, certain that one of the most important functions of the society from the beginning was the performance of experiments before the members. In the royal warrant of 1663&nbsp;ordering the mace which the king presented to the society, it&nbsp;is described as “ The Royal Society for the improving of Natural&nbsp;Knowledge by experiments and during its earlier years the&nbsp;time of the meetings was principally occupied by the performance and discussion of experiments. The society early exercised&nbsp;the power granted by charter to appoint two “ curators of&nbsp;experiments/’ the first holder of that office being Robert&nbsp;Hooke, who was afterwards elected a secretary of the society.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another matter to which the society gave attention was the formation of a museum, the nucleus being “ the collection of&nbsp;rarities formerly belonging to Mr Hubbard,” which, by a&nbsp;resolution of council passed on the 21st of February 1666, was&nbsp;purchased for the sum of £100. This museum, at one time the&nbsp;most famous in London, was presented to the trustees of the&nbsp;British Museum in 1781, upon the removal of the society to&nbsp;Somerset House. A certain number, however, of instruments&nbsp;and models of historical interest have remained in the possession&nbsp;of the society, and some of them, more peculiarly associated&nbsp;with its earlier years, are still preserved at Burlington House.&nbsp;The remainder have been deposited in the Victoria and Albert&nbsp;Museum, South Kensington.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the Great Fire of London in September 1666 the apartments of the Royal Society in Gresham College were&nbsp;required for the use of the city authorities, and the society&nbsp;were therefore invited by Henry Howard of Norfolk to meet&nbsp;in Arundel House. At the same time he presented them with&nbsp;the library purchased by his 'grandfather, Thomas earl of&nbsp;Arundel, and thus the foundation was laid of the important&nbsp;collection of scientific works, now exceeding 60,000 volumes,&nbsp;which the society possesses. Of the Arundel MSS. the bulk&nbsp;was sold to the trustees of the British Museum in 1830 for the&nbsp;sum of £3559, the proceeds being devoted to the purchase of&nbsp;scientific books. These MSS. are still kept in the British&nbsp;Museum as a separate collection. The society, however, still&nbsp;possesses a valuable collection of scientific correspondence,&nbsp;official records, and other manuscripts, including the original&nbsp;manuscript, with Newton’s autograph corrections, from which&nbsp;the first edition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Principia</span><span class="font0"> was printed, and many other&nbsp;original documents of gTeat interest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under date December 21, 1671, the journal-book records that “ the lord bishop of Sarum proposed for candidate Mr&nbsp;Isaac Newton, professor of the mathematicks at Cambridge.”&nbsp;Newton was elected a Fellow January 11, 1671-72, and in 1703&nbsp;he was appointed president, a post which he held till his&nbsp;death in 1727. During his presidency the society moved to&nbsp;Crane Court, their first meeting in the new quarters being held&nbsp;November 8, 1710. In the same year they were appointed&nbsp;visitors and directors of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich,&nbsp;a function which they continued to perform until the accession of William IV., when by the new warrant then issued the&nbsp;president and six of the Fellows of the Royal Astronomical&nbsp;Society were added to the list of visitors.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1780, under the presidency of Sir Joseph Banks, the Royal Society removed from Crane Court to the apartments assigned&nbsp;to them by the government in the new Somerset House, where&nbsp;they remained until they removed to Burlington House in&nbsp;1857. The policy of Sir Joseph Banks was to render the Fellowship more difficult of attainment than it had been; and the&nbsp;measures which he took for this purpose, combined with other&nbsp;circumstances, led to the rise of a faction headed by Dr&nbsp;Horsley. Throughout the years 1783 and 1784 feeling ran&nbsp;exceedingly high, but in the end the president was supported&nbsp;by the majority of the society. An account of the controversy&nbsp;will be found in a tract entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An Authentic Narrative of the&nbsp;Dissensions and Debates in the Royal Society.</span><span class="font0"> An important&nbsp;step in pursuance of the same policy was taken in the year 1847,&nbsp;when the number of candidates recommended for election by&nbsp;the council was limited to fifteen, and the election was made&nbsp;annual. This limitation has remained in force up to the present&nbsp;time. Concurrent wifh the gradual restriction of the Fellowship&nbsp;was the successive establishment of other scientific bodies. The&nbsp;founding of the Linnean Society in 1788 under the auspices of&nbsp;several Fellows of the Royal Society was the first instance of&nbsp;the establishment of a distinct scientific association under royal&nbsp;charter; and this has been followed by the formation of the</span></p>
