 in ichthyology ; a genus arranged by Linnæus under the claſs of <hi rend="italic">amphibia,</hi> and the order oſ <hi rend="italic">nantes,</hi> but by Gmelin referred to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">pisces,</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">chondropterygii.</hi> The head is obtuſe ; on the sides of the neck there are from 4 to 7 ſemilunar ſpiracles. The eyes are oblong, vertical, half covered, and before the <hi rend="italic">foramen temporale.</hi> The mouth is situated in the anterior and lower part of the head, and is armed with ſeveral rows of teeth, which are ſerrated, acute, partly moveable and partly fixed, and unequal in form. The body is oblong, tapering and rough, with very tender prickles. The ventral fins are much leſs than the pectoral, and are ſituated round the anus and genitals. There are 3 2 ſpecies ; the iſabella canicula or greater dog fiſh ; catulus or ſmaller dog-fiſh ; ſtellaris; galeus or tope ; muſtelus or ſmooth hound ; cirratus ; barbatus or barbu ; tigrinus or tigre ; Africanus or galonné ; ocellatus or oeillé ; zygæna or balance-fiſh ; tiburo or pantouflier of Broussonet ; griſeus or griſet ; vulpes or ſea-fox ; longicaudus ; glaucus or blue ſhark ; cornubius, porbeagle, or beaumaris-ſhark ; cinereus or perlon ; maximus ; carcharias or white ſhark ; priſtis or ſcie ; ſpinoſus or bouele ; acanthias or picked dog fiſh ſernandinus ; ſpinax or sagre ; ſquamoſus or ecailleux ; centrina or humantin ; indicus ; Americanus or liche; ſquatina or angel fiſh ; maſſaſa; and kumal. The following are the most remarkable :</p><p>1. The <hi rend="italic">iſabella</hi> has a wrinkly ſpotted ſkin, and the anterior dorſal fin is perpendicular to the abdominal fins. The body is ſomewhat flat ; the head ſhort, large, and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0720.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0714"/>
obtuſe. The teeth are diſpoſed in six rows, compreſſed, ſhort, and triangular, having a notch on each side of their baſes. The eyes are sunk ; the iris is of a copper colour, and the pupil is black and oblong. The fins of the back are almoſt ſquare ; the caudal fin is divided into two lobes, and the lateral line is parallel to the back. The upper part of the body is of a reddiſh aſh- colour, with blackiſh ſpots diſpoſed irregularly. The under part is of a dirty white hue. This ſpecies is found near New Zealand, and is about 2½ feet long.</p><p>2. <hi rend="italic">Canicula,</hi> greater dog-fiſh, or ſpotted ſhark, is diſtinguiſhed by large noſtrils, which are covered by a lobe and warm-ſhaped flap, or by the poſition of the anal fin, which is at an equal distance from the anus and tail. The body is ſpotted ; the head is ſmall, with a ſhort ſnout ; the eyes are oblong ; the iris whitiſh ; the mouth is large and oblong, armed with three rows of teeth ; the tongue is cartilaginous ; the anus is before the middle of the body ; the first dorſal fin is behind the ventral fins ; the other, which is leſs, is almost oppoſite the anal fin ; the caudal fin is narrow and marginated. This ſpecies is found in almost every sea, is about four feet long, extremely voracious, generally feeding on fifties, and is long lived. The skin, which is ſpotted like a leopard’s, is uſed when dried for various purpoſes.</p><p>3. <hi rend="italic">Catulus,</hi> ſmaller dog fiſh, has a large head ; the pupil of the eyes is black ; the iris white ; the ſnout is of a bright hue ; the mouth, which is large, is situated between the noſtrils, and is armed with four rows of teeth, ſerrated with three points bent inwards ; thoſe in the middle between the two mandibles are longer than the rest. The tongue is broad and ſmooth ; the ſpiracles are five ; the back is tapering and yellowiſh ; the sides are ſomewhat compreſſed ; the tail longer than the body, and the caudal fin is narrow and marginated ; the anterior anal and dorſal fins are behind the ventral ; the posterior dorſal fin is oppoſite to the anal. It inhabits the Mediterranean, Northern, and Indian Ocean, and is two or three feet long.</p><p>4. <hi rend="italic">Stellaris,</hi> or greater cat fiſh. The head is marked with points ; the abdominal fins are united and ſharp at the apex ; the dorſal fins extend almost to the tail ; the ſkin is reddiſh, marked with black ſpots of different ſizes, and is of a dirty aſh colour below. It is from two to six feet long ; reſembles the canicula, but distinguiſhed by larger and fewer ſpots, by a ſnout ſomewhat longer, a tail ſomewhat ſhorter, and noſtrils almost ſhut. It brings forth 19 or 20 young at a time. It inhabits the European ſeas, living chiefly on ſhell fiſh, molluscæ, and other ſmall fiſhes. The dorſal fins are equal ; the anterior one being behind the middle of the body, and the posterior one being a little behind the anal.</p><p>5. <hi rend="italic">Tigrinus,</hi> or tigre, is about 15 feet long; the body is long, of unequal thickneſs, black, interſperſed with white stripes and ſpots, irregularly and tranſverſely.— The head is large ; the mouth low and tranſverſe, the upper jaw having two curls ; the upper lip is thick and prominent ; there are five ſpiracles on each side, the two last being united ſo as to give the appearance only of four ; the mandibles are armed with very ſmall pointed teeth ; the tongue is ſhort and thick ; the eyes ſmall and oblong ; the pupil azure coloured ; the iris black. The abdomen is broad ; the pectoral fins are broad, and rounded at the extremity. The anterior dorſal is oppoſite to the ventral fins, and the posterior dorſal fin to the anal. The tail is compreſſed on both sides, and the fin which terminates it is hollow. The tigrinus is found in the Indian Ocean, and lives chiefly on ſhell fiſh. See Plate CCCCLXXVI. fig. 1.</p><p>7. <hi rend="italic">Zygaena, marteau,</hi> or balance-fiſh, is frequently six feet long, and weighs 500 lbs. The head is elongated on each side ; the fore part is bent back, and convex both above and below. At the extremities of the elongated part are the eyes, which are large, prominent, and directed downwards ; the iris is of a golden colour ; the mouth is arched, and near the beginning of the trunk. It has a horrible appearance from the teeth, which are arranged in three or four rows, and are broad, pointed, and ſerrated on both sides. The tongue is thick, broad, and like a man’s. The trunk is long and tapering : the fins are ſemicircular on the margin, and black at the baſis ; the ventral fins are ſeparate ; the anal and poſterior dorſal fins are ſmall ; the anterior dorſal fin is large, and near the head ; the caudal is long.— This ſpecies inhabits the Mediterranean Sea and the Indian Ocean. It is one of the moſt voracious of the whole tribe. See fig. 2.</p><p>8. <hi rend="italic">Vulpes,</hi> or ſea-fox, is moſt remarkable for the great length of its tail, the body being about ſeven feet and the tail six feet long. The head is ſhort and conical ; the eyes are large ; the jaws are armed in a dreadful manner with three rows of triangular, compreſſed, and pointed teeth ; the tongue is blunt ; the lateral line is straight. The anterior dorſal fin is placed about the middle of the back ; the poſterior, which consists of two pointed lobes, is oppoſite to the anal fin ; the ventral fins are very near one another ; the anal is acuminated ; the inferior lobe of the tail is about a foot long ; the upper, which is shaped like a ſcythe, is five times longer. This ſpecies inhabits the Mediterranean, the coast of Scotland and England. It is covered with ſmall ſcales ; its back is aſh-coloured, belly whitiſh. It is extremely voracious. The ancients styled this fiſh αλωπηζ and <hi rend="italic">vulpes,</hi> from its ſuppoſed cunning. They believed, that when it had the misfortune to have taken a bait, it ſwallowed the hook till it got at the cord, which it bit off, and ſo eſcaped.</p><p>9. <hi rend="italic">Glaucus,</hi> or blue ſhark, is about ſeven feet long. The colour of the back is a fine blue ; the belly a ſilvery white ; the head is flat ; the eyes ſmall and roundiſh ; the teeth are almoſt triangular, elongated, and pointed, but not ſerrated. The anus is very near the tail ; the anterior dorſal fin is situated before the ventral fins, about the middle of the body, and is almoſt triangular ; the poſterior dorſal fin is equal to the anal fin, and is placed nearer the tail ; the pectoral fins are large, long, and marginated ; and the ventral are blue above and white below ; the caudal is blue, divided into two lobes, of which the ſuperior is much longer than the inferior lobe. This ſpecies is frequent in every ſea, and is fierce, but not very destructive in our ſeas.</p><p>10. The <hi rend="italic">maximus,</hi> balking ſhark, or the ſun-fiſh of the Iriſh. This ſpecies has been long known to the inhabitants of the ſouth and west of Ireland and Scotland, and thoſe of Caernarvonſhire and Angleſea ; but having never been considered in any other than a commercial view, is deſcribed by no Engliſh writer except Mr Pennant ; and, what is worſe, mistaken for and confounded with the luna of Rondeletius, the same<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0721.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0715"/>
that our Engliſh writers call the ſun-fiſh. The Iriſh and Welſh give it the ſame name, from its lying as if to ſun itſelf on the ſurface of the water ; and for the ſame reaſon Mr Pennant calls it the baſking ſhark. It was long taken for a ſpecies of whale, till Mr Pennant pointed out the bronchial orifices on the ſides, and the perpendicular site of the tail. Theſe are migratory fiſh,or at leaſt it is but in a certain number of years that they are ſeen in multitudes on the Welſh ſeas, though in moſt ſummers a single, and perhaps a ſtrayed fiſh appears. They inhabit the northern ſeas, even as high as the arctic circle. They viſited the bays of Caernar- vonſhire and Angleſea in vaſt ſhoals in the ſummers of 1756 and a few ſucceeding years, continuing there only the hot months ; for they quitted the coaſt about Michaelmas, as if cold weather was diſagreeable to them. Some old people say they recollect the ſame sort of fiſh viſiting theſe ſeas in vaſt numbers about 40 years ago. They appear in the Frith of Clyde, and among the Hebrides, in the month of June, in ſmall droves of ſeven or eight, but oftener in pairs. They continue in thoſe ſeas till the latter end of July, when they diſappear.</p><p>They have nothing of the fierce and voracious nature of the ſhark kind, and are ſo tame as to ſuffer themſelves to be ſtroked ; they generally lie motionleſs on the ſurface, commonly on their bellies, but ſometimes, Eke tired ſwimmers, on their backs. Their food ſeems to conſiſt entirely of ſea plants, no remains of fiſh being ever diſcovered in the stomachs of numbers that were cut up, except ſome green fluff, the half digested parts of algæ, and the like. Linnæus ſays it feeds on meduſae.</p><p>At certain times, they are ſeen ſporting on the waves, and leaping with vast agility ſeveral feet out of the water. They ſwim very deliberately, with the dorſal fins above water. Their length is from three to twelve yards, and ſometimes even longer. Their form is rather ſlender, like others of the ſhark kind. The upper jaw is much longer than the lower, and blunt at the end. The tail is very large, and the upper part remarkably longer than the lower. The colour of the upper part of the body is a deep leaden ; the belly white. The ſkin is rough like ſhag- reen, but leſs ſo on the belly than the back. In the mouth, towards the throat, is a very ſhort sort of whale-bone. The liver is of a great size, but that of the female is the largest; ſome weigh above 1000 pounds, and yield a great quantity of pure and ſweet oil, fit for lamps, and alſo much uſed to cure bruiſes, burns, and rheumatic complaints. A large fiſh has afforded to the captors a profit of 20 l. They are viviparous ; a young one about a foot in length being found in the belly of a fiſh of this kind. The meaſurements of one found dead on the ſhore of Loch Ranza in the iſle of Arran were as follow: The whole length, 27 feet 4 inches ; firſt dorſal fin, 3 feet ; second, 1 foot ; pectoral fin, 4 feet ; ventral, 2 feet ; the upper lobe of the tail, 5 feet ; the lower, 3.</p><p>They will permit a boat to follow them, without accelerating their motion till it comes almoſt within contact when a harponeer strikes his weapon into them, as near to the gills as poſſible. But they are often ſo inſenſible as not to move till the united ſtrength of two men have forced in the harpoon deeper. As ſoon as thcy perceive themſelves wounded, they fling up their tail and plunge headlong to the bottom ; and frequently coil the rope round them in their agonies, attempting to diſengage the harpoon by rolling on the ground, for it is often found greatly bent. As ſoon as they diſcover that their efforts are in vain, they ſwim away with amazing rapidity, and with ſuch violence, that there has been an inſtance of a veſſel of 70 tons having been towed away againſt a freſh gale. They ſometimes run off with 200 fathoms of line, and with two harpoons in them ; and will employ the fiſhers for 12, and ſometimes for 24 hours, before they are ſubdued. When killed, they are either hauled on ſhore, or, if at a diſtance from land, to the vessel’s side. The liver (the only uſeful part), is taken out, and melted into oil in kettles provided for that purpoſe. A large fiſh will yield eight barrels of oil, and two of worthleſs ſediment.</p><p>II. <hi rend="italic">Carcharias, requin,</hi> or white ſhark, is often 30 feet long, and according to Gillius weighs 4000 pounds. The mouth of this fiſh is ſometimes furniſhed with a six-fold row of teeth, flat, triangular, and exceedingly ſharp at their edges, and finely ſerrated. Mr Pennant had one rather more than an inch and a half long. Grew ſays, that thoſe in the jaws of a ſhark two yards in length are not half an inch ; ſo that the fiſh to which this tooth belonged muſt have been six yards long, provided the teeth and body keep pace in their growth.</p><p>This dreadful apparatus, when the fiſh is in a ſtate of repoſe, lies quite flat in the mouth ; but when he ſeizes his prey, he has power of erecting them by the help of a ſet of muſcles that join them to the jaw. The mouth is placed far beneath ; for which reaſon theſe, as well as the rest of the kind, are ſaid to be obliged to turn en their backs to ſeize their prey ; which is an obſervation as ancient as the days of Pliny. The eyes are large ; the back broad, flat, and ſhorter than that of other ſharks. The tail is of a ſemilunar form, but the upper part is longer than the lower. It has vaſt ſtrength in the tail, and can strike with great force ; ſo that the ſailors inſtantly cut it off with an axe as ſoon as they draw one on board. The pectoral fins are very large, which enables it to ſwim with great ſwiftneſs. The colour of the whole body and fins is a light aſh. The ancients were acquainted with this fish ; and Oppian gives a long and entertaining account of its capture. Their fleſh is ſometimes eaten, but is eſteemed coarſe and rank.—They are the dread of the ſailors in all hot climates, where they conſtantly attend the ships in expectation of what may drop over-board : a man that has that misfortune periſhes without redemption ; they have been ſeen to dart at him like gudgeons at a worm. A maſter of a Guinea ſhip informed Mr Pennant, that a rage of suicide prevailed among his new-bought ſlaves, from a notion the unhappy creatures had, that after death they ſhould be reſtored again to their families, friends, and country. To convince them at leaſt that they ſhould not reanimate their bodies, he orderd one of their corpſes to be tied by the heels to a rope and lowered into the ſea ; and though it was drawn up again as faſt as the united force of the crew could be exerted, yet in that ſhort ſpace the ſharks had devoured every part but the feet, which were ſecured at the end of the cord.</p><p>Swimmers very often periſh by them ; ſometimes<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0722.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0716"/>
they lose an arm or leg, and ſometimes are bit quite aſunder, ſerving but for two morſels for this ravenous animal : a melancholy tale of this kind is related in a West India ballad, preſerved in Dr Percy’s Relics of ancient Engliſh Poetry.</p><p>This ſpecies inhabits the abyſs of the ocean, and only appears on the ſurface when allured by its prey. It is the moſt voracious of all animals, not even it is ſaid ſparing its own offspring, and often ſwallowing its prey entire. At the famous naval battle of the 12th of April 1782, when the Caeſar, one of the French ſhips of the line, was ſet on fire, the ſailors threw themſelves into the ſea, Sir Charles Douglas obſerved great numbers of theſe ſharks, which lay between the French and Britiſh fleets, inſtantly ſeize on the unhappy victims. He ſeveral times ſaw two of them diſputing about their prey, each ſeizing a leg, and at length disappearing, dragging the body along with them. Notwithſtanding the continued roar of artillery, he heard diſtinctly the cries of thoſe unhappy men.</p><p>12. <hi rend="italic">Pristis, ſcie,</hi> or ſaw-fiſh, is sometimes 15 feet long, ſmooth, black on the upper parts, aſh coloured on the sides, and white underneath. The head is flat and conical ; the beak or ſnout projecting from the noſe is about five feet long, covered with a coriaceous ſkin, and armed on each side, generally with 24 long, ſtrong, and ſharp-pointed teeth ; but the number varies with age. The teeth are granulated ; the eyes large, the iris of a golden colour, and the ſpiracles five. The anterior dorſal fin correſponds to thoſe of the belly ; the poſterior is situated in the middle, between the former and apex of the tail ; the pectoral fins are broad and long ; the caudal is ſhorter than in the other ſpecies. It inhabits all the ſeas from Greenland to Brazil : and is found alſo in the Indian Ocean. It is harmleſs.</p><p>13. <hi rend="italic">Spinax, ſagre,</hi> or picked dog-fiſh, takes its name from a ſtrong and ſharp ſpine placed juſt before each of the back-fins, diſtinguishing it at once from the reſt of the Britiſh ſharks. The noſe is long, and extends greatly beyond the mouth, but is blunt at the end. The teeth are diſpoſed in two rows, are ſmall and ſharp, and bend from the middle of each jaw towards the corners of the mouth. The back is of a browniſh aſh-colour ; the belly white.—It grows to the weight of about 20 pounds. This ſpecies ſwarms on the coaſts of Scotland, where it is taken, ſplit, and dried ; and is a food among the common people. It forms a sort of inland commerce, being carried on womens backs 14 or 16 miles up the country, and fold or exchanged for neceſſaries.</p><p>14. <hi rend="italic">Squatina,</hi> angel-fiſh, is from six to eight feet long, has a large head ; teeth broad at their baſe, but ſlender and very ſharp above, and diſpoſed in five rows all round the jaws. Like thoſe of all ſharks, they are capable of being raiſed or depreſſed by means of muſcles uniting them to the jaws, not being lodged in ſockets as the teeth of cetaceous fiſh are. The back is of a pale aſh-colour, and very rough ; along the middle is a prickly tuberculated line : the belly is white and ſmooth. The pectoral fins are very large, and extend horizontally from the body to a great diſtance ; they have ſome reſemblance to wings, whence its name. The ventral fins are placed in the ſame manner, and the double penis is placed in them ; which forms another character of the males in this genus.</p><p>This is the fiſh which connects the genus of rays and ſharks, partaking ſomething of the character of both ; yet is an exception to each in the situation of the mouth, which is placed at the extremity of the head. It is a fiſh not unfrequent on moſt of our coaſts, where it prowls about for prey like others of the kind. It is extremely voracious ; and, like the ray, feeds on flounders and flat fiſh, which keep at the bottom of the water. It is extremely fierce, and dangerous to be approached Mr Pennant mentions a fiſherman whoſe leg was terribly torn by a large one of this ſpecies, which lay within his nets in ſhallow water, and which he went to lay hold of incautiouſly. The aſpect of theſe, as well as the reſt of the genus, have much malignity in them : their eyes are oblong, and placed lengthwiſe in their head, ſunk in it, and overhung by the ſkin, and ſeem fuller of malevolence than fire. Their skin is very rough ; the ancients made uſe of it to poliſh wood and ivory, as we do at preſent that of the greater dog-fiſh. The fleſh is now but little eſteemed on account of its coarſeneſs and rankneſs ; yet Archeſtratus (as quoted by Athenaeus, p. 319.), ſpeaking of the fiſh of Miletus, gives this the firſt place, in reſpect to delicacy, of the whole cartilaginous tribe. They grow to a great ſize ; being ſometimes near an hundred weight.</p><p>Sharks are ſeldom deſtructive in the temperate regions ; it is in the torrid zone that their ravages are moſt frequent. In the West Indies accidents happen from them almoſt every day.</p><p>“During the American war in 1780, while the Pallas frigate was lying in Kingſton harbour,<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Moseley on Tropical Diseases</p></note> a young North American jumped overboard one evening to make his eſcape, and periſhed by a ſhark in a ſhocking manner.</p><p>“ He had been captured in a ſmall veſſel, loſt all his property, and was detained by compulsion in the Engliſh navy, to ſerve in a depredatory war againſt his country. But he, animated with that ſpirit which pervaded every boſom in America, reſolved, as ſoon as he arrived at ſome port, to releaſe himſelf from the mortifying ſtate of employing his life againſt his country, which, as he ſaid when dying, he was happy to lay down, as he could not employ it againſt her enemies.</p><p>“ He plunged into the water ; the Pallas was a quarter of a mile from the ſhore. A ſhark perceived him, and followed him, very quietly, till he came to a ſtate of reſt, near the ſhore : where, as he was hanging by a rope, that moored a veſſel to a wharf, ſcarcely out of his depth, the ſhark ſeized his right leg, and ſtripped the fleſh entirely away from the bones, and took the foot off at the ancle. He ſtill kept his hold, and called to the people in the veſſel near him, who were ſtanding on the deck and law the affair. The ſhark then ſeized his other leg, which the man by his ſtruggling diſengaged from his teeth, but with the fleſh cut through down to the bone, into a multitude of narrow ships/ The people in the veſſel threw billets of wood into the water, and frightened the ſhark away. The young man was brought on ſhore. Dr Moſeley was called to him ; but he had loſt ſo much blood before any aſſiſtance could be given him, that he expired before the mangled limbs could be taken off.</p><p>“A few weeks before this accident happened, a ſhark, of 12 feet in length, was caught in the harbour; and<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0723.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0717"/>
on being opened, the entire head of a man was found in ’ his ſtomach. The ſcalp, and fleſh of the face, were macerated to a ſoft pulpy ſubſtance ; which, on being touched, ſeparated entirely from the bones. The bones were ſomewhat ſoftened, and the futures looſened.”</p><p>The following extraordinary inſtance of intrepidity and friendſhip is well worth recording. It is given on the authority of Mr Hughes, who publiſhed a natural hiſtory of Barbadoes. About the latter end of Queen Anne’s wars, captain John Beanis, commander of the York Merchant, arrived at Barbadoes from England. Having diſembarked the laſt part of his lading, which was coals, the ſailors, who had been employed in that dirty work, ventured into the ſea to waſh themſelves ; there they had not been long before one on board eſpied a large ſhark making toward them, and gave them notice of their danger ; upon which they ſwam back, and all reached the boat except one : him the monſter overtook almost within reach of the oars, and griping him by the ſmall of his back, ſoon cut him aſunder, and as ſoon ſwallowed the lower part of his body ; the remaining part was taken up and carried on board, where a comrade of his was, whoſe friendſhip with the deceaſed had been long diſtinguiſhed by a reciprocal diſcharge or all ſuch endearing offices as implied an union and ſympathy of souls. When he ſaw the severed trunk of his friend, it was with an horror and emotion too great for words to paint. During this affecting ſcene, the inſatiate ſhark was ſeen traverſing the bloody surface in ſearch of the remainder of his prey ; the rest of the crew thought themſelves happy in being on board, he alone unhappy, that he was not within reach of the deſtroyer. Fired at the light, and vowing that he would make the devourer diſgorge, or be ſwallowed himſelf in the ſame grave, he plunges into the deep, armed with a ſharp-pointed knife. The ſhark no ſooner ſaw him, but he made furiouſly toward him ; both equally eager, the one of his prey, the other of revenge. The moment the ſhark opened his rapacious jaws, his adverſary dexterouſly diving, and graſping him with his left hand ſomewhat below the upper fins, ſucceſsfully employed his knife in his right hand, giving him repeated ſtabs in the belly ; the enraged ſhark, after many unavailing efforts, finding himſelf overmatched in his own element, endeavoured to diſengage himſelf, ſometimes plunging to the bottom, then mad with pain, rearing his uncouth form, now ſtained with his own streaming blood, above the foaming waves. The crews of the ſurrounding veſſels ſaw the unequal combat, uncertain from which of the combatants the ſtreams of blood iſſued ; till at length the ſhark, much weakened by the loss of blood, made toward the ſhore, and with him his conqueror ; who, fluffed with an aſſurance of victory, pushed his foe with redoubled ardour, and, by the help of an ebbing tide, dragged him on ſhore, ripped up his bowels, and united and buried the severed carcase of his friend ”</p><p>“ It is evident (says Dr Moſeley, to whoſe valuable work we are indebted for the ſtory of the American related above), that digeſtion in theſe animals is not performed by trituration, nor by the muſcular action of the ſtomach ; though nature has furniſhed them with a ſtomach of wonderful force and thickneſs, and far exceeding that of any other creature. Whatever their force of digeſtion is, it has no effect upon their young ones, which always retreat into their ſtomachs in time of danger.</p><p>“ That digeſtion is not performed by heat in fiſh, is equally evident. Being on the Banks of Newfoundland in Auguſt 1782, I opened many cod-fiſh, and ripped up their ſtomachs juſt as they came alive out of the water ; in which were generally found ſmall oystiers, muſcles, cockles, and crabs, as well as ſmall fiſhes of their own and other ſpecies. The coldneſs oſ the ſtomach of theſe fiſhes is far greater than the temperature of the water out of which they are taken ; or of any other part of the fiſh, or of any other ſubſtance of animated nature I ever felt. On wrapping one of them round my hand, immediately on being taken out of the fiſh, it cauſed ſo much aching and numbneſs that I could not endure it long.”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
