He became a fellow of Queens’ College, Cambridge, in 1531, and was afterwards appointed to read the public Greek lecture, in the discharge of which function</p><p>he first introduced the new Greek pronunciation, which soon became universal in England. After studying in France and Italy and taking a degree in law at Padua, he was appointed first regius professor of civil law in Cambridge in 1542. During Somerset’s protectorate he entered public life and was sent as ambassador first to Brussels and afterwards to France. In 1548 he was made a secretary of state and knighted.
