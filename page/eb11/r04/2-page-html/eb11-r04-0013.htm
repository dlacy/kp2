<p><span class="font0">usually supposed to have been intended to take the place of the raw metal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(aes rude)</span><span class="font0"> formerly in use, and so facilitate the process&nbsp;of weighing; but there is more reason for thinking they were cast&nbsp;and stamped as standards to be put into one scale, while the raw&nbsp;metal whose weight was to be ascertained was put into the other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Instead, therefore, of being a fictitious sale, as Gaius describes it, and as it became after the introduction of coined money in the&nbsp;4th century of the city, the mancipation, as regulated by Servius,&nbsp;was an actual completed sale in the strictest sense of the term.&nbsp;What were the precise words of style addressed by the transferee&nbsp;to the transferrer, or what exactly the form of the ceremonial, we&nbsp;know not. But, as attendance during all the time that some&nbsp;thousands of pounds, perhaps of copper, were being weighed would&nbsp;have been an intolerable burden upon the five citizens convoked&nbsp;to discharge a public duty, it may be surmised that it early became&nbsp;a common practice to have the price weighed beforehand, and then&nbsp;to re weigh, or pretend to reweigh, before the witnesses only a single&nbsp;little bit of metal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(raudusculum)</span><span class="font0">, which the transferee then handed&nbsp;to the transferrer as “ the first pound and the last,” and thus&nbsp;representative of the whole.<sup>@@1</sup> And where no real price was intended, as in constituting a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dos</span><span class="font0"> or in coemption, a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raudusculum&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">would also be employed. Whatever may have been its form,&nbsp;however its effect was instant exchange of property against a&nbsp;price weighed in the scales. The resulting obligation on the vendor&nbsp;to maintain the title of the vendee, and the qualifications that&nbsp;might be superinduced on the conveyance by agreement of parties&nbsp;—the so-called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">leges mancipii—</span><span class="font0">will be considered below in connexion&nbsp;with the provisions of the XII. Tables on the subject </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(infra</span><span class="font0">, p. 542).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The things included in the class of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font0"> were lands and houses held on Quiritarian title, together with rights of way and&nbsp;aqueduct, slaves, and the following domestic beasts of draught or&nbsp;burden, viz. oxen, horses, mules and donkeys; all others were&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi.</span><span class="font0"> Many theories have been propounded&nbsp;to account for the distinction between these two classes&nbsp;of things, and to explain the principle of selection that&nbsp;admitted oxen and horses into the one, but relegated such animals&nbsp;as sheep and swine to the other. But there is really little difficulty.&nbsp;Under the arrangement of Servius, wha.t was to determine the nature&nbsp;and extent of a citizen’s political qualifications, military duties and&nbsp;financial burdens was apparently the value of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heredium</span><span class="font0"> (and&nbsp;other lands, if he had any), and what may be called its appurtenances—the slaves that worked for the household, the slaves and&nbsp;beasts of draught and burden that worked the farm, all of which&nbsp;lived and worked in common with the free members of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">familia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">But the cattle a man depastured on the public meadows were no&nbsp;more </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font0"> than his sheep, a fact which, though ultimately&nbsp;in the later Empire lost sight of, was still understood in the time&nbsp;of Gaius.<sup>@@2</sup> To say that the things classed as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font0"> were selected&nbsp;for that distinction by Servius because they were what were essential&nbsp;to a family engaged in agricultural pursuits would be to fall short&nbsp;of the truth. They </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">constituted</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">familia</span><span class="font0"> in the sense of the family&nbsp;estate proper; whereas the herds and flocks, and everything else&nbsp;belonging to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias,</span><span class="font0"> fell under the denomination of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">petunia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">So the words are to be understood perhaps in the well-known&nbsp;phraseology of the mancipatory testament, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">familia pecuniaque mea.<sup>@@3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The public solemnity of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mancipatio</span><span class="font0"> thus sanctioned as a mode of transferring a Quiritarian right of property, for which </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">was probably as yet the only descriptive word in use, was not long&nbsp;in being adapted to and utilized for other transactions in which&nbsp;other kinds of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> were sought to be acquired. These new&nbsp;adaptations, if confined at first for the most part to plebeians,&nbsp;were also soon made use of by the patricians, perhaps before as well&nbsp;as after the XII. Tables, and became by custom part of the common&nbsp;law. Such were, for example, coemption (as explained above),&nbsp;emancipation and adoption of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiifamilias,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa</span><span class="font0"> aliena</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tion of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">familia</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nexum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Law of Succession.—</span><span class="font0">The legal order of succession during the regal period was extremely simple. It was this, on the death&nbsp;of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> his patrimony devolved upon those&nbsp;of his descendants </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font0"> who by that event&nbsp;became </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris</span><span class="font0">, his widow (being </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">loco filiae)</span><span class="font0"> taking&nbsp;an equal share with them, and no distinction being&nbsp;made between movables and immovables. Such persons&nbsp;were styled self-heirs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(sui keredes).</span><span class="font0"> Failing widow and children,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">his patrimony went to his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens.</span><span class="font0"> The notion that between the descendants and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> came an intermediate class under&nbsp;the name of agnates does not seem well founded as regards the&nbsp;regal period; the succession of agnates as such seems to have&nbsp;been first legally recognized by the XII. Tables, probably&nbsp;to meet the case of the plebeians, who, having no </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gentes,</span><span class="font0"> were&nbsp;without legal heirs in default of children.<sup>@@4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The later jurists more than once refer to the perfect equality of the sexes in the matter of succession in the ancient law.<sup>@@5</sup> But it&nbsp;was rather nominal than real. A daughter who had passed into&nbsp;the hand of a husband during her father’s lifetime of course could&nbsp;have no share in the latter’s inheritance, for she had ceased to be a&nbsp;member of his family. One who was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font0"> at his death, and&nbsp;thereby became </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui juris,</span><span class="font0"> did become his heir, unless he had prevented such a result by testamentary arrangements; but even&nbsp;then it was in the hands of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> to prevent risk of prejudice to&nbsp;themselves. For she could not marry, and so carry her fortune&nbsp;into another family, without their consent as her guardians;&nbsp;neither could she without their consent alienate any of the more&nbsp;valuable items of it; nor, even with their consent, could she make&nbsp;a testament disposing of it in prospect of death. Her inheritance,&nbsp;therefore, was hers in name only; in reality it was in the hands of&nbsp;her guardians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of primogeniture or legal preference of one member of the family over the others there, is not the faintest trace. And yet we are&nbsp;told of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">heredia</span><span class="font0"> remaining in a family for many generations—a&nbsp;state of matters that would have been impossible had every death&nbsp;of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> necessarily involved a splitting up of the family&nbsp;estate. It is conceivable that this was sometimes prevented by&nbsp;arrangement amongst the heirs themselves; and the practice&nbsp;of every, now and then drafting the younger members of families&nbsp;to colonies diminished the number of those who had a claim to&nbsp;participate. But the simplest plan of avoiding the difficulty was&nbsp;for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> to regulate his succession by testament; and&nbsp;this was probably had recourse to, not so much for instituting a&nbsp;stranger heir when a man had no issue—according to patrician&nbsp;notions his duty, then was to perpetuate his family by adopting a&nbsp;son—as for partitioning the succession when he had more children&nbsp;than one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There were two sorts of testaments made use of by the patricians of the regal period—that made in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comitia</span><span class="font0"> of the&nbsp;curies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(test, calatis comitiis)</span><span class="font0"> and that made in the&nbsp;presence of the army (probably represented for this&nbsp;purpose by a few comrades) on the eve of battle&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(test, in procinctu factum).</span><span class="font0"> The first at least—and the second&nbsp;was just a substitute for it on an emergency—was far from&nbsp;being an independent exercise of the testator’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">voluntas.</span><span class="font0"> For,&nbsp;though in course of time, and under the sanction of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uti&nbsp;legassit ita jus ¿sto</span><span class="font0"> of the XII. Tables, the curieS may have&nbsp;become merely the recipients of the oral declaration by the&nbsp;testator of his last will, in order that they might testify to&nbsp;it after his death, it is impossible not to see in the comitial&nbsp;testament what must originally have been a legislative act,&nbsp;whereby the testator’s peers, for reasons which they and&nbsp;the presiding pontiffs thought sufficient, sanctioned in the particular case a departure from the ordinary rules of succession.&nbsp;The pontiffs were there to protect the interests of religion,&nbsp;and the curies to protect those of the testator’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gen$\</span><span class="font0"> and it&nbsp;is hardly conceivable that a testament could have been sanctioned by them which so far set at nought old traditions as to&nbsp;deprive a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias of</span><span class="font0"> his birthright, at least in favour of&nbsp;a stranger.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The conjecture is suggested by the words of style in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">solutio per aes et libram,</span><span class="font0"> Gai. iii. §§ 173, 174. There were some debts from&nbsp;which a man could be effectually discharged only by payment&nbsp;(latterly fictitious) by copper and scales in the presence of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">libripens&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the usual five witnesses. In the words addressed to the creditor&nbsp;by. the debtor making payment these occurred—</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hanc tibi libram&nbsp;primam postremamque expendo</span><span class="font0"> (“ I weigh out to you this the first&nbsp;and the last pound ”). The idea is manifestly archaic, and the&nbsp;words, taken strictly, are quite inappropriate to the transaction in&nbsp;the form it had assumed long before the time of Gaius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@2 </sup>Gai. ii. 15; Ulpian, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Frag.</span><span class="font0"> xix. 1.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@3 </sup>Gai. fi. 104. By the time of the XII. Tables the sharp distinction between these two terms is tending to disappear.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@4 </sup>It is quite true, however, that from the first the order of succession was agnatic; for it was those only of a man’s children who were agnate that had any claim to his inheritance; and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">was, theoretically at least, just a body of agnates. The supposed&nbsp;mention of agnates in a law attributed to Numa is a conjecture of&nbsp;P. E. Huschke’s (in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Analecta litteraria,</span><span class="font0"> Leipzig, 1826, p. 375). The&nbsp;law is preserved in narrative by Servius, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">In Virg. Eclog.</span><span class="font0"> iv. 43,&nbsp;which runs thus: “ In Numae legibus cautum est, ut si quis im-prudens occidisset hominem, pro capite occisi et naris ejus in cautione&nbsp;(Scalig.. concione) offerret arietem.” Huschke’s substitution of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">agnatis</span><span class="font0"> for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">et natis</span><span class="font0"> is all but universally adopted; but, even were&nbsp;it necessary, it need mean nothing more than his children </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@5 </sup>The Voconian law of 169 n.c. avowedly introduced something new in prohibiting a man of fortune from instituting a woman,&nbsp;even his only daughter, as his testamentary heir; but even it&nbsp;did not touch the law of intestacy. See Girard, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manuel,</span><span class="font0"> 4th ed.&nbsp;p. 816.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
