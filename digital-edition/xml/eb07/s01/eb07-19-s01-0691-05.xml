a group of islands off the coast of Cornwall, from which they are distant about thirty miles. These islands are supposed by some to have been the Cassiterides or Ten Islands with which the Phoenicians traded ; but that is a disputable point. There are six islands of this group that are inhabited, but they are all in one parish, that of St Mary, in which is the parish church. There are a few small islands, or rather bare rocks, with no inhabitants, among which is that which gives its name to the whole group. The island of St Mary contains more inhabitants than all the others, and the town on it is the only one. In 1831 it contained 1311 inhabitants. It has a harbour, a church, and strong fortifications. On the island of St Agnes is the important lighthouse, which is of the highest value to ships approaching the channel in wintry or foggy weather. There is likewise on it a small church. The cultivation of these islands is imperfect, and does not, in common years, produce more than a bare sufficiency of food for the population, which is consequently on the decline ; appearing by the census of 1821 to have amounted to 2614, and by that of 1831 to 2465. In unfruitful seasons the greatest distress for food has been experienced, though in all seasons fish is the common aliment. These islands are dangerous to approach, and have been fatal to many ships, as well as to Admiral Shovel and a part of his fleet in the beginning of the last century. There are establishments of pilots ready to assist vessels, and they often conduct vessels into the harbour of St Mary, through intricate and hazardous passages. There are said to be several Druidical remains on these islands. The population in 1831 was, St Mary, 1311 ; Tresco, 470; St Agnes, 289 ; St Martins, 230 ; Bryher, 128 ; and Sampson Isle, 37.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
