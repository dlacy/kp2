The usual form consists of a fine screw moving in a nut carried on the centre of a small three-legged table. The lower end of the screw and those of the table legs are finely tapered and terminate in hemispheres, so that each rests on a point. If the screw has two turns of the thread to the millimètre, the head is usually divided into 500 equal parts, so that differences of 0Ό01 millimètre may be measured without using a vernier. A vertical scale fastened to the table indicates the number of whole turns of the screw and serves as a fixed point for reading the divisions on the head. In order to measure the thickness of a plate the instrument is placed on a level plane surface and the screw turned until the point just touches ; the exact instant when it does so is defined by a sudden diminution of resistance succeeded by a considerable increase. The divided head and scale are read ; the screw is raised ; the thin plate slipped under it ; and the process is repeated. The difference between the two readings gives</p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s05-0398" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0422.jp2"/><p>the required thickness. A contact-lever, delicate level, or electric contact arrangement may be attached to the sphero-meter in order to indicate the moment of touching more precisely than is possible by the sense of touch. To measure the radius of a sphere— <hi rend="italic">e.g.,</hi> the curvature of a lens— the spherometer is levelled and read, then placed on the sphere, adjusted until the four points exert equal pressure, and read again. The difference gives the thickness of that portion of the sphere cut off by a plane passing through the three feet ; and, since the feet are equidistant, this distance (<hi rend="italic">a</hi>) being known gives the value (<hi rend="italic">R</hi>) of the radius</p><p>from the formula 2 <hi rend="italic">R = a + h,</hi> where <hi rend="italic">h</hi> is the thickness of</p><p>the lenticular segment. The <hi rend="italic">well spherometer</hi><note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> A. M. Meyer, in <hi rend="italic">American Journal of Science,</hi> 1886, xxxii. p. 61. </note> <hi rend="italic"/>is adapted for measuring small spherical lenses. The true plane on which the instrument stands is perforated by a cylindrical well of known diameter. A plate applied to the lower edge of the well by a spring is adjusted to be parallel to the large plane, and the spherometer screw, being centred over the well, is run down until it touches the plate, and then read. The plate is removed ; the lens put in its place; the point—still accurately centred—is brought down ; and the screw is read again. The difference between these readings gives the height of the section of the lens above the lower edge of the well. Calling this height <hi rend="italic">h</hi> and the radius of the cylindrical well <hi rend="italic">r,</hi> the radius <hi rend="italic">R</hi> of the sphere is got by the formula 2 <hi rend="italic">R = ^ + h.</hi> The spherometer can be applied to test the sphericity of a globe, and may be used on either a convex or a concave surface.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
