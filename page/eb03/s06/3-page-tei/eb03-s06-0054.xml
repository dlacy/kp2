The command of the veſſels was committed to Captain Greig, a meritorious ſeaman ; and the management of the goods was entruſted to Mr Straw, a gentleman distinguiſhed for his mercantile knowledge. The ſale turned out to advantage ; but ſuch great expences were incurred in making preſents to the bey of Cairo and Suez, as to consume the whole profits gained by the ſale of the cargo. The great purpoſe of the expedition was, however, accompliſhed, as a firman was obtained from the government of Cairo to trade by the way of Suez. In conſequence of this, three ſhips went to Suez the following year, and as many in 1778. The opening of this trade alarmed the jealouſy of the East India Company ; they applied to our government, and orders were given to relinquiſh this promiſing commerce. Theſe orders reached Egypt ſooner than Bengal, and the conſequence was fatal to the unfortunate adventurers who viſited Suez that year (1779). By a plan concerted between the beys, a large body of Bedouin Arabs attacked the caravan paſſing from Suez to Cairo with goods valued at 12 lacks of rupees. The goods were plundered, the Europeans were ſtripped and left naked in the desert, expoſed to the burning rays of the ſun, without a drop of water to quench their thirſt, or food to ſupport life. Moſt of them died, and ſome of their bodies were afterwards found mangled and disfigured by wolves. We have been favoured with a particular account of the ſufferings of our countrymen by a correſpondent, which, we are sorry, we have not room to inſert. Thoſe who wish to obtain a more full account may conſult the Annual Registor 1781 or 1782.</p><p>SUFFETULA (anc. geog.), a town of Africa, in the dominions of Carthage ; probably ſo called ſrom Suffetes, the title of the magiſtrates of that city. It is now called <hi rend="italic">Spaitla,</hi> in the kingdom of Tunis, and has many elegant remains of antiquity. There are three temples in a great meaſure entire ; one of them of the Compoſite order, the other two Corinthian. “ A beautiful and perfect capital of the Compoſite order (says Mr Bruce), the only perfect one that now exiſts, is deſigned in all its parts in a very large ſize ; and with the detail of the rest of the ruin, is a precious monument of what that order was, now in the collection of the king.” The town itſelf (he says) is situated in the moſt beautiful ſpot in Barbary, ſurrounded by great numbers of juniper-trees, and watered by a pleaſant ſtream, which ſinks under the earth at that place, without appearing any more.</p><p>SUFFOCATION, in medicine, the privation of reſpiration or breathing. See the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Drowning, Hanging,</hi> &amp;c.</p><p>SUFFOLK, a county of England. Its name is contracted from <hi rend="italic">Southfolk,</hi> ſo called from its ſituation in regard to Norfolk. It is bounded on the west by Cambridgeſhire ; on the ſouth by Effex, from which it is parted by the river Stour ; on the eaſt by the German Ocean ; and on the north by Norfolk, separated from it by the Lesser Ouſe and the Waveney@@. From west to eaſt it is 52 miles in length, about 20 at a medium in breadth, and 196 in circumference. It contains 22 hundreds, 29 market towns, 575 pariſhes, upwards of 34,000 houſes, and more than 200,000 inhabitants. The whole is divided into two parts, viz. the Liberty of St Edmund, and the Geldable ; the former of which contain the west parts of the county, and the other the eaſt ; and there is a grand jury for each at the aſſizes. The air is reckoned as wholeſome and pleaſant as any in the kingdom, nor is it otherwiſe upon the ſea coaſt, which is dry and ſandy, and free from salt marſhes. The soil, except to the west and upon the ſea-coaſt, is very rich, being a compound of clay and marle. Towards the ſea there are large-heaths and tracts of sand ; but theſe produce hemp, rye, and peaſe, and ſeed great flocks of ſheep. About Newmarket the soil is much the ſame ; but in high Suffolk or the woodlands, beſides wood, there are very rich paſtures, where abundance of cattle are fed. In other parts of the county, as about Bury, there is plenty of corn. As this county is noted for the richneſs of its paſtures, so is it for butter and cheeſe, eſpecially the former, which is ſaid to be remarkably good ; ſo that being packed up in firkins, it is ſold for all uſes both by sea and land, and conveyed to many parts of England, eſpecially to London. The inland parts of the county are well ſupplied with wood for fuel, and thoſe upon the ſea-coaſt with coals from New- caſtle. The manufactures of the county are chiefly woollen and linen cloth. It lies in the diocese of Norwich, has two archdeacons, viz. of Sedbury and Suffolk ; gives title of earl to a branch of the Howards ; sends two members to parliament for the county, and two for each of the following places, Ipſwich, Dunwich, Orford, Aldborough, Sudbury, Eye, and St Edmund’s-Bury. The county is extremely well watered by the following rivers, which either traverſe its borders, or run acroſs into the German Ocean, viz. the Lesser Ouſe, the Waveney, the Blithe, the Deben, the Orwell or Gipping, and the Stour.</p><p>SUFFRAGAN, an appellation given to simple biſhops with regard to archbiſhops, on whom they depend, and to whom appeals lie from the biſliops courts.</p><p>Suffragan is likewiſe the appellation given to a biſhop, who is occaſionally appointed to reſide in a town or village, and aſſiſt the dioceſan.</p><p>SUFFRAGE, denotes a vote given in an aſſembly, where ſomething is deliberated on, or where a perſon is elected to an office or benefice.</p><p>SUFFRUTEX, among botaniſts, denotes an underſhrub, or the loweſt kind of woody plants, as lavender.</p><p>SUGAR, a ſolid ſweet subſtance obtained from the juice of the ſugar-cane ; or, according to chemiſts, an essential salt, capable of cryſtallization, of a ſweet and agreeable flavour, and contained in a greater or leſs quantity in almoſt every ſpecies of vegetables, but moſt abundant in the ſugar-cane.</p><p>As the ſugar-cane is the principal production of the West Indies, and the great ſource of their riches ; as it is ſo important in a commercial view, from the employment which it gives to ſeamen, and the wealth which it opens for merchants; and beſides is now become a neceſſary of life—it may juſtly be eſteemed one of the moſt valuable plants in the world. The quantity conſumed in Europe is eſtimated at nine millions Sterling, and the demand would probably be greater it it could be ſold at a reduced price. Since ſugar then is reckoned ſo precious a commodity, it must be an object of deſire to all perſons of curioſity and reſearch, to obtain ſome general knowledge of the hiſtory and nature of the plant by which it is produced, as well as to underſtand the proceſs by which the juice is extracted and refined. We will therefore firſt inquire in what countries it originally flouriſhed, and when it was brought into general uſe, and became an article of commerce.</p><p>From the few remains of the Grecian and Roman authors which have ſurvived the ravages of time, we can find no proofs that the juice of the ſugar-cane was known at a very early period. There can be no doubt, however, that in thoſe countries where it was indigenous its value was not long @@@[mu] Gough's edition of Camden's Britannia.</p></body></text></TEI>
