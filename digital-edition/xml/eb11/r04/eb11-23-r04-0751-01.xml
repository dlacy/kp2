<p><label>ROSSI, LUIGI DE</label>
a 17th-century Italian musical composer, said to have been born at Naples towards the close of the 16th century. Of his life practically nothing is known. An opera •of his, <hi rend="italic">Il Palazzo Incantato,</hi> was given at Rome in 1642; in 1646 he was invited by Cardinal Mazarin to Paris, where he gave his opera <hi rend="italic">Le Mariage d'Orphee et d’Euridice</hi> (1647), the first Italian opera performed in Paris. A collection of cantatas published in 1646 describes him as musician to Cardinal Antonio Berberini, and G. A. Perti in 1688 speaks of him along with Carissimi and Cesti as “ the three greatest lights of our profession.” Rossi is noteworthy principally for his chamber-cantatas, which are among the finest that the 17th century produced. A large quantity are in MS. in the British Museum and in Christ Church library, Oxford. <hi rend="italic">La Gelosia,</hi> printed by F.A. Gevaert in <hi rend="italic">Les Gloires d'Italie,</hi> is an admirable specimen.</p>
