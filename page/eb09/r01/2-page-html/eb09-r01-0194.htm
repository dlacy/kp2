<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">mysticism, symptomatic of a widespread desire to grasp at something simpler, purer, and less rigid than Latin&nbsp;theology afforded. Devoid of criticism, devoid of sound&nbsp;learning, devoid of a firm hold on the realities of life,&nbsp;these heresies passed away without solid results and were&nbsp;forgotten.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We are too apt to take for granted that the men of the Middle Ages were immersed in meditations on the other&nbsp;<sup>1</sup> world, and that their intellectual exercises were confined to&nbsp;, abstractions of the schools, hallucinations of the fancy,&nbsp;allegories, visions. This assumption applies indeed in a&nbsp;broad sense to that period which was dominated by&nbsp;intolerant theology and deprived of positive knowledge.&nbsp;Yet there are abundant signs that the native human&nbsp;instincts, the natural human appetites, remained unaltered&nbsp;and alive beneath the crust of orthodoxy. In the person&nbsp;of a pope like Boniface VIII. those ineradicable forces of&nbsp;the natural man assumed, if we may trust the depositions&nbsp;of ecclesiastics well acquainted with his life, a form of&nbsp;brutal atheistic cynicism. In the person of an emperor,&nbsp;Frederick IL, they emerged under the more agreeable&nbsp;garb of liberal culture and Epicurean scepticism. Frederick&nbsp;dreamed of remodelling society upon a mundane type,&nbsp;which anticipated the large toleration and cosmopolitan&nbsp;enlightenment of the actual Renaissance. But his efforts&nbsp;were defeated by the unrelenting hostility of the church,&nbsp;and by the incapacity of his contemporaries to understand&nbsp;his aims. After being forced in his lifetime to submit to&nbsp;authority, he was consigned by Dante to hell. Frederick’s&nbsp;ideal of civilization was derived in a large measure from&nbsp;Provence, where a beautiful culture had prematurely&nbsp;bloomed, filling southern Europe with the perfume of&nbsp;poetry and gentle living. Here, if anywhere, it seemed&nbsp;as though the ecclesiastical and feudal fetters of the&nbsp;Middle Ages might be broken, and humanity might enter&nbsp;on a new stage of joyous unimpeded evolution. This&nbsp;was, however, not to be. The church preached Simon&nbsp;de Montfort’s crusade, and organized Dominic’s Inquisition; what Quinet calls the “Renaissance sociale par&nbsp;1’Amour ” was extirpated by sword, fire, famine, and pestilence. Meanwhile the Provençal poets had developed&nbsp;their modern language with incomparable richness and&nbsp;dexterity, creating forms of verse and modes of emotional&nbsp;expression which determined the latest mediaeval phase of&nbsp;literature in Europe. The naturalism of which we have&nbsp;been speaking found free utterance now in the fabliaux&nbsp;of jongleurs, lyrics of minnesingers, tales of trouvères,&nbsp;romances of Arthur and his knights,—compositions&nbsp;varied in type and tone, but in all of which sincere&nbsp;passion and real enjoyment of life pierce through the thin&nbsp;veil of chivalrous mysticism or of allegory with which&nbsp;they were sometimes conventionally draped. The tales&nbsp;of Lancelot and Tristram, the lives of the troubadours&nbsp;and the Wachtlieder of the minnesingers, sufficiently&nbsp;prove with what sensual freedom a knight loved the lady&nbsp;whom custom and art made him profess to worship as a&nbsp;saint. We do not need to be reminded that Beatrice’s&nbsp;adorer had a wife and children, or that Laura’s poet owned&nbsp;a son and daughter by a concubine, in order to perceive&nbsp;that the mystic passion of chivalry was compatible in the&nbsp;Middle Ages with commonplace matrimony or vulgar&nbsp;illegitimate connexions. But perhaps the most convincing testimony to the presence of this ineradicable&nbsp;naturalism is afforded by the Latin songs of wandering&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">3</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> students, known as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Carmina Burana,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> written by the self-styled Goliardi. In these compositions, remarkable for&nbsp;their facile handling of mediaeval Latin rhymes and&nbsp;rhythms, the allegorizing mysticism wdiich envelops chivalrous poetry is discarded. Love is treated from a frankly&nbsp;carnal point of view. Bacchus and Venus go hand in&nbsp;hand, as in the ancient ante-Christian age. The open-air enjoyments of the wood, the field, the dance upon&nbsp;the village green, are sung w<sup>r</sup>ith juvenile lightheartedness.&nbsp;No grave note, warning us that the pleasures of this&nbsp;earth are fleeting, that the visible world is but a symbol&nbsp;of the invisible, that human life is a probation for the&nbsp;life beyond, interrupts the tinkling music as of castanets&nbsp;and tripping feet which gives a novel charm to these&nbsp;unique relics of the 13th century. Goliardic poetry is&nbsp;further curious as showing how the classics even at that&nbsp;early period were a fountainhead of pagan inspiration.&nbsp;In the taverns and low places of amusement haunted by&nbsp;those lettered songsters, on the open road and in the&nbsp;forests trodden by their vagrant feet, the deities of Greece&nbsp;and Rome were not in exile, but at home within the&nbsp;hearts of living men. Thus, while Christendom was still&nbsp;]ireoccupied with the crusades, two main forces of the&nbsp;Renaissance, naturalism and enthusiasm for antique modes&nbsp;of feeling, already brought their latent potency to light,&nbsp;prematurely indeed and precociously, yet with a promise&nbsp;that was destined to be kept.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">When due regard is paid to these miscellaneous evidences of intellectual and sensual freedom during the Middle Ages, it will be seen that there were by no means&nbsp;lacking elements of native vigour ready to burst forth.&nbsp;What was wanting w<sup>r</sup>as not vitality and licence, not&nbsp;audacity of speculation, not lawless instinct or rebellious&nbsp;impulse. It was rather the right touch on life, the right&nbsp;feeling for human independence, the right way of approaching the materials of philosophy, religion, scholarship, and&nbsp;literature, that failed. The courage that is born of&nbsp;knowledge, the calm strength begotten by a positive&nbsp;attitude of mind, face to face with the dominant overshadowing Sphinx of theology, were lacking. We may&nbsp;fairly say that natural and untaught people had more of&nbsp;the just intuition that was needed than learned folk&nbsp;trained in the schools. But these people were rendered&nbsp;licentious in revolt or impotent for salutary action by&nbsp;ignorance, by terror, by uneasy dread of the doom declared&nbsp;for heretics and rebels. The massive vengeance of the&nbsp;church hung over them, like a heavy sword suspended in&nbsp;the cloudy air. Superstition and stupidity hedged them&nbsp;in on every side, so that sorcery and magic seemed the&nbsp;only means of winning power over nature or insight into&nbsp;mysteries surrounding human life. The path from darkness to light was lost; thought w׳as involved in allegory ; the study of nature had been perverted into an&nbsp;inept system of grotesque and pious parable-mongering;&nbsp;the pursuit of truth had become a game of wordy&nbsp;dialectics. The other world with its imagined heaven&nbsp;and hell haunted the conscience like a nightmare. However sweet this world seemed, however fair the flesh, both&nbsp;world and flesh were theoretically given over to the devil.&nbsp;It was not worth while to master and economize the&nbsp;resources of this earth, to utilize the goods and ameliorate&nbsp;the evils of this life, while every one agreed, in theory at&nbsp;any rate, that the present was but a bad prelude to an&nbsp;infinitely worse or infinitely better future. To escape&nbsp;from these preoccupations and prejudices except upon the&nbsp;path of conscious and deliberate sin was impossible for&nbsp;all but minds of rarest quality and courage; and these&nbsp;were too often reduced to the recantation of their supposed&nbsp;errors no less by some secret clinging sense of guilt than&nbsp;by the church’s iron hand. Man and the actual universe&nbsp;kept on reasserting their rights and claims, announcing&nbsp;their goodliness and delightfulness, in one way or another ;&nbsp;but they were always being thrust back again into&nbsp;Cimmerian regions of abstractions, fictions, visions, spectral&nbsp;hopes and fears, in the midst of which the intellect&nbsp;somnambulistically moved upon an unknown way.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
