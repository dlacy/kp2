<p><span class="font1">institutions attributed to the Sabines and Etruscans were, as Mommsen and others have shown common to all peoples of&nbsp;Greek-Italian stock, and could not be strange to the Latins.&nbsp;We must hold that the Romans were essentially a Latin&nbsp;race, though influenced by a considerable admixture&nbsp;with Sabine and, to a lesser degree, Etruscan races (sec&nbsp;Rome).</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2">Patricians, Clients and Plebeians.—But whatever their ethnographic descent, it is pretty certain that the Roman civitas was in the earliest period an organization that was&nbsp;patriarchal in its essence, but in which there was to be&nbsp;distinguished, on the one hand, a dominant class enjoying all the rights of citizenship, and, on the other, a semi-servile&nbsp;or quasi-vassal class excluded from such rights. The former class&nbsp;were called patricii or Quirites;@@<sup>1</sup> the latter were called clientes&nbsp;and (later) plebeii.</span></h1>
<p><span class="font1">Patricians.—There was part of the law of Rome that even in the Empire was known by the name of jus Quiritium, and this&nbsp;in the regal period was the only law. The patricians at&nbsp;first were the Quirites, and prior at least to the time of&nbsp;Servius Tullius they alone enjoyed rights under this law.&nbsp;From their number the council of elders was selected; they&nbsp;alone could take part in the curiate comitia; they alone could&nbsp;contract a lawful marriage and make a testament; in a word,&nbsp;all the peculiar institutions of early Rome were for their benefit&nbsp;alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But these rights and prerogatives they enjoyed as members of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes</span><span class="font1"> or clans, the clans being aggregations of families bear-ing a common name and theoretically at least tracing&nbsp;their descent from a common ancestor. These clans, of&nbsp;which there were normally three hundred altogether&nbsp;according to a rather doubtful tradition, were organized consti-tutionally in curies. Of the curies, again, there were thirty in&nbsp;all, there being probably ten in each of the three tribes, organized&nbsp;primarily for military and secondarily for political and religious&nbsp;purposes. Though for the federation of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">curiae</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Rome required a common ruler and common institutions,&nbsp;religious, militarnd political, yet it was long before such&nbsp;federation into a state displaced entirely the separate institutions of the several </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes.</span><span class="font1"> Every clan had its own cult peculiar&nbsp;to its own members. It had its common property and its&nbsp;common burial-place. It probably had some common council&nbsp;or assembly, for we read not only of special gentile customs,&nbsp;but of gentile statutes and decrees. Tradition records instances&nbsp;of wars waged by individual </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes,</span><span class="font1"> indicating that they had&nbsp;the right to require military service alike from their members&nbsp;and dependants. Widows and orphans of deceased clansmen&nbsp;were under the guardianship of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> or of some particular&nbsp;member of it to whom the trust was specially confided. If a&nbsp;clansman left no descendants, his property passed to his fellow-gentiles. Finally, its members were always entitled to rely&nbsp;upon its assistance, to have maintenance when indigent, to be&nbsp;ransomed from captivity, and to be avenged when killed or&nbsp;injured.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Alongwith the gentiles there were in Rome from the earliest period other persons known by the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">clientes</span><span class="font1"> (clients). Their origin is wholly unknown. Some of them may&nbsp;have been the original inhabitants of Rome and their&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">descendants,but more probably they were mostly immigrants from other communities or citizens of conquered towns whom&nbsp;the Romans were unable or unwilling to treat as slaves. Some&nbsp;may have been slaves to whom liberty </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> had been given.&nbsp;Following a custom familiar both to Latins and Sabines, such&nbsp;persons were placed under the protection of the heads of&nbsp;patrician families. The relationship was hereditary on both&nbsp;sides, and known as that of patron and client. The client@@</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">became a dependent member of his patron’s clan—not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentilis </span><span class="font1">but </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gcntilicius.</span><span class="font1"> His patron had to provide him with what&nbsp;was necessary for his sustenance and that of his family; and,&nbsp;as ownership or possession of lands increased in extent, it&nbsp;was probably not unusual for the patron or his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> to give&nbsp;him during pleasure a plot of land to cultivate for himself.&nbsp;The patron had, moreover, to assist him in his transactions&nbsp;with third parties, and obtain redress for him when injured.&nbsp;The client, on the other hand, had to maintain his patron’s&nbsp;interests by every means in his power. But the advantage&nbsp;must have been chiefly on the side of the client, who, without&nbsp;becoming a citizen, obtained directly the protection of his&nbsp;patron and his clan, and indirectly that of the state. A large&nbsp;number of clients attached themselves to and received protection&nbsp;from the king as patron—“ royal clients,” as Cicero calls them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The plebeians </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(plebs,</span><span class="font1"> from ttX^os, meaning crowd), as distinguished from the clients, must be regarded as a heterogeneous mass of non-gentile freemen. It used to be the prevailing opinion among modern writers, following&nbsp;the Roman historians, that the plebeians existed as a body&nbsp;since the very beginning of the city. They were thought to be&nbsp;mainly composed of immigrants and refugees who, wiiile being&nbsp;allowed personal liberty, declined to submit themselves to a&nbsp;patron. But recently a theory of Mommsen, based on solid&nbsp;philological and other grounds, has obtained wide adhesion&nbsp;and tends to become the dominant one. Mommsen’s view is&nbsp;that at first there were only two classes in the community, the&nbsp;patricians and clients, or, in other words, that* the only plebeians&nbsp;were the clients who, as such, possessed only quasi-liberty&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Halbfreiheit)</span><span class="font1">, and that it was not till after a century or two&nbsp;that the practice of voluntary clientage began to decay and the&nbsp;class of plebeian freemen arose. This was partly due to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">dying out, so that the clients attached to them were left without&nbsp;patrons; partly to the numbers of foreigners at Rome (through&nbsp;transplantation of the inhabitants of conquered cities and&nbsp;otherwise) having become so large that they felt themselves&nbsp;sufficiently powerful to do without protection; and partly to&nbsp;other causes@@</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">However this be, it is generally admitted that, during the latter part of the present epoch at least, plebeians existed&nbsp;as a body composed of individuals of mixed races not united&nbsp;by any gentile organizations of their own nor attached to any&nbsp;Roman </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gentes.</span><span class="font1"> Tradition attributes to Numa the formation&nbsp;of gilds or societies of craftsmen, such as potters, carpenters,&nbsp;gold- and silver-smiths </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{collegia opificum)</span><span class="font1"> at Rome, eight or&nbsp;nine in number. This, though probably a myth as regards&nbsp;Numa, may be taken as slight evidence of the creation among&nbsp;the plebeians of associations for trade and other purposes,&nbsp;that to some extent compensated them for the want of gentile&nbsp;organization. These gilds seem to have had a common cult&nbsp;and a common council to arrange disputes and consolidate&nbsp;customs. Between the brethren </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(sodales)</span><span class="font1"> there was a bond&nbsp;of close alliance and interdependence, each owing duty to&nbsp;the other similar to what might be claimed from </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">guest or a&nbsp;kinsman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Regulatives of Public and Private Order.—</span><span class="font1">It would be absurd to expect any definite </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">system of law</span><span class="font1"> in those early times.&nbsp;What passed for it was a composite of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas, jus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">boni mores,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">whose several limits and characteristics it is extremely difficult&nbsp;to define. This may to some extent be accounted for by the&nbsp;fact that much of what was originally within the domain of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fas,</span><span class="font1"> once it had come to be enforced by secular tribunals, and&nbsp;thus had the sanction of human authority, was no longer&nbsp;distinguishable from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus;</span><span class="font1"> while it may be that others of its&nbsp;behests, once pontifical punishments for their contravention&nbsp;had gone into desuetude, sank to nothing higher than precepts&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">boni mores.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">arose from the voluntary subjection of poorer citizens to the rich is an hypothesis supported by no satisfactory authority.</span></p>
