<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">ments. Radcliffe Tower, dating from the 13th century, and formerly an extensive manorial residence, is now&nbsp;a complete ruin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cotton-weaving, calico-printing, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">bleaching are the principal industries, and there are extensive collieries in the neighbourhood. The town is&nbsp;governed by a local board of health established in 1866.&nbsp;The area of the urban sanitary district is 2453 acres, with&nbsp;a population in 1871 of 11,446, and in 1881 of 16,267.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Radcliffe is so called from a cliff of red rock on the south side of the Irwell opposite the town. The manor was held by Edward&nbsp;the Confessor, and was conferred on Roger de Poictou, but was&nbsp;forfeited by him soon after the Domesday survey. In the reign&nbsp;of Stephen it was granted to Ranulph de Gernons, earl of Chester.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RADCLIFFE, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ann Ward </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1764-1823), novelist, was born in London on 9th July 1764. She was the author of&nbsp;three novels unsurpassed of their kind in English literature, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Romance of the Forest</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1791), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Mysteries of&nbsp;Udolpho</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1794), </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Italian</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1797). The interval of three&nbsp;years between the successive publications is noticeable;&nbsp;works so elaborate, intricate, and closely interwoven could&nbsp;not be written in a hurry. The second of the three novels&nbsp;is the one commonly associated with Mrs Radcliffe’s name,&nbsp;but the preference is probably due to the title; each is an&nbsp;improvement on its predecessor, and the last is considerably&nbsp;the best on the whole in style as well as in plot and character. She wrote two other novels before any of these,&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Castles of Atldin and Dunbayne</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1789) and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sicilian&nbsp;Romance</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1790), but they attracted no special attention&nbsp;and deserve none, although in them she works with the&nbsp;same romantic materials—dreadful castles, wild adventures,&nbsp;terrible characters. One other was written after the famous&nbsp;three, but not published till 1826, three years after her&nbsp;death—</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gaston de Blondeville</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">, interesting as an elaborate&nbsp;study of costume and scenery, and valuable as a monument&nbsp;of her accurate archaeological learning, but comparatively&nbsp;tedious as a story, though not without passages in her best&nbsp;style. The circumstances that turned Mrs Radcliffe to&nbsp;literature are not recorded in the meagre memoir published&nbsp;under her husband’s direction. Her maiden name was&nbsp;Ward, and her parents, who are described as “ persons of&nbsp;great respectability, though engaged in trade,” in London,&nbsp;had literary relations. Her husband was an Oxford graduate and proprietor and editor of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">English Chronicle.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">After </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Italian</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> she gave up writing for publication, and&nbsp;was reported to have been driven mad by the horrors of&nbsp;her own creations. This was purely mythical. It appears&nbsp;that she never saw the Italian scenery which she depicts&nbsp;with such minuteness, and never left England but once, in&nbsp;the summer of 1794, after the completion of her </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">TJdolpho.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A record of the tour was published in the following year,&nbsp;along with descriptions of a visit to the English Lakes,&nbsp;the beauties of which she was one of the first to celebrate.&nbsp;Of scenery, as might be judged from her novels, where the&nbsp;descriptions are often felt as a tedious impediment, Mrs&nbsp;Radcliffe was an enthusiastic amateur, and made driving&nbsp;tours with her husband every other summer through the&nbsp;English counties. She died in February 1823.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">As a novelist Mrs Radcliffe deserves a much higher place than is accorded to her in general estimation. Critics familiar with her&nbsp;works, from Sir Walter Scott downwards, have shown themselves&nbsp;fully alive to the difference; but the general public confound her&nbsp;with puerile and extravagant imitators, who have vulgarized her&nbsp;favourite “properties” of rambling and ruinous old castles, dark,&nbsp;desperate, and cadaverous villains, secret passages, vaults, trapdoors,&nbsp;evidences of deeds of monstrous crime, sights and sounds of mysterious horror. She deserves at least the credit of originality, but&nbsp;apart from this there are three respects in which none of her numerous imitators approach her,—ingenuity of plot, fertility of incident,&nbsp;and skill in devising apparently supernatural occurrences capable&nbsp;of explanation by human agency and natural coincidence. Except&nbsp;in her last and posthumously published work she never introduces&nbsp;the really supernatural, and, whether or not we agree with Sir&nbsp;Walter Scott that this limitation was a mistake in art, it must at&nbsp;least be acknowledged to impose a heavier burden on the author’s&nbsp;ingenuity. Her imitators found it easier to follow Horace Walpole&nbsp;in this point. Some of the tragic situations in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">The Italian</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> are&nbsp;worked out with a vivid power of imagination which it would be&nbsp;hard to parallel in English literature outside the range of the Elizabethan drama, with the minor celebrities of which Mrs Radcliffe&nbsp;may fairly challenge comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RADETZKY, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Johann־ </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">J. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">W. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">A. F. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">C., Count of Radetz </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1766-1858), field-marshal of Austria, was born&nbsp;at Trzebnitz in Bohemia in 1766, to the nobility of which&nbsp;province his family belonged. He entered a cavalry regiment in 1784 and served under Joseph II. and Laudon&nbsp;against the Turks in 1788 and 1789. In 1793 his regiment&nbsp;was sent to the lower Rhine, and from this time onwards&nbsp;Radetzky was engaged in the wars which were continued&nbsp;(with intermission) between Austria and France for the&nbsp;next twenty years. In 1796 he was adjutant to General&nbsp;Beaulieu, over whom Bonaparte won his first victories in&nbsp;Italy. In 1799, when the Austrians with Suwaroffs help&nbsp;reconquered Northern Italy, he distinguished himself at&nbsp;the battles of Novi and the Trebbia, displaying, according to the despatches of General Mêlas, great presence&nbsp;of mind in the midst of extreme danger. After the defeat&nbsp;of Marengo he was removed from Italy to Germany, and&nbsp;there took part in the still more disastrous engagement&nbsp;of Hohenlinden. In 1805 Radetzky, now major-general,&nbsp;was back in Italy, serving under the archduke Charles&nbsp;in the successful campaign of Caldiero, the fruits of which&nbsp;were lost by Mack’s capitulation at Ulm and the fall of&nbsp;Vienna. In 1809 he fought at Wagram. In 1813, when&nbsp;all the great powers of Europe combined against Napoleon,&nbsp;Radetzky was chief of the staff under Schwarzenberg, the&nbsp;Austrian commander-in-chief of the allied forces, and he&nbsp;now gained a reputation outside his own country. The&nbsp;plan of the battle of Leipsic is said to have been in great&nbsp;part Radetzky’s work, and in this engagement he was&nbsp;wounded. He entered Paris with the allied sovereigns&nbsp;in March 1814, and returned with them to the congress&nbsp;of Vienna, where he appears to have acted as an intermediary between Metternich and the czar Alexander,&nbsp;when these great personages were not on speaking terms.&nbsp;During the succeeding years of peace he disappeared from&nbsp;the public view and narrowly escaped being pensioned&nbsp;off in 1829. The insurrection of the Papal Legations in&nbsp;1831 brought him, however, into active service again;&nbsp;and on the retirement of General Frimont he was placed&nbsp;in command of all the Austrian forces in Italy, receiving&nbsp;in 1836 the dignity of field-marshal. Radetzky was now&nbsp;seventy years old, but twelve more years were to pass&nbsp;before the really historical part of his career opened.&nbsp;When he was eighty-two the revolution of 1848 broke out.&nbsp;Milan rose in insurrection against its Austrian rulers, and&nbsp;after a struggle of five days Radetzky was forced to evacuate the city. Unable to retain any hold on Lombardy,&nbsp;he concentrated his troops at Verona, the fortifications of&nbsp;which were to a great extent his own creation. Charles&nbsp;Albert, king of Sardinia, now declared war upon Austria,&nbsp;occupied Milan, and laid siege to Peschiera. Radetzky,&nbsp;after the arrival of reinforcements, moved southwards to&nbsp;Mantua, and attempted from that point to turn the Sardinian flank ; he was, however, defeated on the Mincio,&nbsp;and Peschiera fell into the enemy’s hands. Radetzky,&nbsp;nevertheless, was secure in the possession of Verona and&nbsp;Mantua ; and, after being still further reinforced, he resumed the offensive in July, defeated the Sardinians at Cus-tozza and in several other encounters, and advanced victoriously upon Milan, where, on 6th August, an armistice was&nbsp;concluded, the Sardinian army retiring behind the Ticino.&nbsp;During the succeeding months, while Vienna and the&nbsp;central provinces of the Austrian empire appeared likely to&nbsp;fall into anarchy, Radetzky’s army remained firm in its&nbsp;loyalty to the old order of things, and declined to enter</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
