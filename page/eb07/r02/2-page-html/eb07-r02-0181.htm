<p><span class="font1">wife,” is generally acknowledged to be a most beautiful sepulchral monument.@@<sup>1</sup> It consists of a round tower formed of immense blocks of Tiburtine stone fixed together without cement, and adorned with a Doric marble&nbsp;frieze finely sculptured. This beautiful tower was at one&nbsp;time turned into a fortress by the family of the Gætani. In&nbsp;tlle sepulchral vault was found the beautiful marble sarcophagus ofCecilia Metella, now in the Palazzo Farnese. Near&nbsp;the Porta San Paolo, in the “ Prati del Popolo Romano,”&nbsp;(“ the meadows of the Roman people,”) stands the grey&nbsp;pyramid of Caius Cestius. It rises about a hundred and&nbsp;twenty feet in height, and is entirely built of marble. Its&nbsp;form is graceful, and its appearance very picturesque. The&nbsp;“ Prati del Romano” are planted round with mulberry trees,&nbsp;and now form the burial place of foreigners, excluded by&nbsp;their religion from tlle other cemeteries. By far the greater&nbsp;part of the strangers interred here are English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The extensive catacombs found about Rome owe their origin to the large excavations which were made by the&nbsp;Romans for obtaining pozzolano, an immense quantity of&nbsp;which they used, and exported for sand and mortar, and&nbsp;other purposes. These subterraneous labyrinths branch&nbsp;out many miles in various directions. Those under the&nbsp;church of St. Sébastian alone are said to have been explored&nbsp;to the extent of above fifteen miles. Those dreary regions&nbsp;afforded shelter to the first Christians during the dreadful&nbsp;persecutions which they suffered under the emperors. They&nbsp;were also used as sepulchres, but all the bones which they&nbsp;once contained have bcεn carried off as precious relics.&nbsp;The chambers are all square, with arched recesses, and rectangular gaps, both in the walls and flooring, to receive&nbsp;coffins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It has been said that perhaps no city in the world abounds with such numbers of churches as Rome, or with fewer&nbsp;handsome ones as respects their architecture. Many of the&nbsp;old churches of Rome are still called basilica,@@<sup>2</sup> but that title&nbsp;properly belongs to the following seven, St. Peter’s, St. John&nbsp;Lateran’s, Santa Maria Maggiore’s, S. Paolo </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fuori le muro,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Sante Croce in Gierusalemme, S. Sebastiano, and S. Lorenzo&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fuori le muro.</span><span class="font1"> St. Peter’s is the finest church in the world,&nbsp;excelling all others, not only in magnitude but in beauty.&nbsp;It was projected by Pope Nicholas V. in the middle of the&nbsp;fifteenth century ; it was not, however, till the pontificate of&nbsp;Julius II. in 1506, that the first stone ofthe edifice was laid,&nbsp;and the whole building was not finished till the year 1621,&nbsp;during the pontificate of Paul V. No fewer than twenty-four popes, counting from Nicholas V., assisted in the erection of this magnificent structure. It is said to cover twenty&nbsp;acres, and to have cost many millions sterling. It is&nbsp;entirely built of Travertine stone, which looks as bright&nbsp;and fresh as if newly finished. The length of the building&nbsp;is 609 feet, and of the transept 500 feet, the height of the&nbsp;dome is 440 feet, the height of the nave 154, and its breadth&nbsp;90 feet. The plan of the building was frequently changed.&nbsp;The original architect was Bræmante, but the greater part&nbsp;was from the design of Michael Angelo, which, however, has</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">unfortunately been marred by Paul V. and Carlo Moderni, justly stigmatized as “ a wretched plasterer from Como,&nbsp;who broke the sacred unity of the master-idea, and whom&nbsp;we must execrate for the Latin cross, the aisles, the attic,&nbsp;and the front.”@@<sup>3</sup> From the front of the church on either&nbsp;side, a grand semicircular colonnade, composed of four rows&nbsp;of columns, sweeps round and encloses the immense circular&nbsp;area, in the centre of which stands a noble Egyptian obelisk&nbsp;of red granite, between two most beautiful fountains. The&nbsp;general effect is greatly injured by the Vatican Palace, which&nbsp;is built on one side of St. Peter’s, overlooking the top of&nbsp;the colonnade, and destroying its uniformity. A covered&nbsp;portico extends along the whole breadth of the building,&nbsp;vaulted with gilt stuccos, and paved with various marbles.&nbsp;It lengthens on the eye by a grand succession of doors,&nbsp;niches, statues, and fountains, till the perspective terminates&nbsp;with the equestrian statue of Charlemagne. The nave is&nbsp;infinitely grand and sublime, and is impannelled with the&nbsp;rarest and richest marbles, and adorned with every art of&nbsp;sculpture and of taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The splendid canopy of the great altar, and the wreathed columns which support it, were formed out of the bronze&nbsp;taken from the Pantheon by Urban VIII. A double marble staircase leads down to the confessional or tomb of St.&nbsp;Peter, illuminated by more than a hundred never-dying&nbsp;lamps. His sepulchre is surrounded by a circular vault,&nbsp;which is lined with the tombs of popes, saints, emperors, and&nbsp;deposed or abdicated princes, among whom are the last of&nbsp;the Stuart family, the emperor Otho, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The stupendous dome, viewed in its design, its altitude, or even its decoration, is altogether unrivalled, and has justly been pronounced the triumph of modern architecture.&nbsp;A broad paved road leads up to the top of the church, and&nbsp;from thence the dome may be ascended by a succession of&nbsp;ingeniously contrived staircases. From the top an extensive prospect may be obtained of the beautiful amphitheatre&nbsp;of hills which encloses the Campagna. The summits of the&nbsp;loftier Apennines behind, wτeathed with snow ; the Tiber in&nbsp;its sinuous windings through the waste ; in the distance the&nbsp;blue waters of thc Mediterranean gleaming in the sunbeams;&nbsp;and, far beneath, Rome, with her churches, her palaces, her&nbsp;dark and distant ruins, the rich verdure, and golden fruit&nbsp;of the orange gardens of her convents, contrasting with the&nbsp;deep shade of their mournful cypresses.@@<sup>4</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The church or basilica of St. John Lateran was built by Constantine, and during many ages before the erection of&nbsp;St. Peter’s church, was regarded as the mother of churches,&nbsp;and head of the Christian world. It derived its name from&nbsp;Plautius Lateranus, the leader of the first and unsuccessful&nbsp;conspiracy against Nero.@@<sup>5</sup> This church has been frequently rebuilt, enlarged, and improved, and the old architecture&nbsp;now lies completely concealed in the modern. It is a very&nbsp;large but by no means handsome building, and its architecture is deformed by many glaring defects.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The old basilica of St. Paul, founded by Constantine, and rebuilt by Honorius, contained a hundred and twenty pillars</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
