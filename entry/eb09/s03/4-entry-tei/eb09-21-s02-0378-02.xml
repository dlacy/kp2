It was many years ago believed <hi rend="italic">(Edin. N. Philos.

H. Soc. Glasgow,</hi> ii. p. 121, and <hi rend="italic">Proc. Phys. Soc. Edinburgh,</hi> vii. p. 203). The Scaup-Duck has considerable likeness to the Pochard (vol. xix. p. 252), both in habits and appearance ; but it much more generally affects salt-water, and the head of the male is black, glossed with green, and hence the name of “ Blackhead,” by which it is commonly known in North America, where, however, a second species or race, smaller than the ordinary one, is also found, the <hi rend="italic">Fuligula affinis.</hi> The female Scaup-Duck can be readily distinguished from the Dunbird or female Pochard by her broad white face.
