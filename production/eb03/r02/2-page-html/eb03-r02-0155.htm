<p><span class="font1">ever-ruled by Cinna and Carbo, a reſolution was taken to murder without mercy all the ſenators who had oppoſed the popular faction. This was immediately put&nbsp;in execution. A general ſlaughter commenced, which&nbsp;laſted five days, and during which the greateſt: part of&nbsp;the obnoxious ſenators were cut off, their heads Ruck&nbsp;upon poles over-againſt the roſtra, and their bodies&nbsp;dragged with hooks into the forum, where they were&nbsp;left to be devoured by dogs. Sylla’s houſe was demoliſhed, his goods con ſeated, and he himſelf declared&nbsp;an enemy to his country ; however,, his wife and children had the good fortune to make their eſcape.—&nbsp;This maſſacre was not confined to the city of Rome.&nbsp;The ſoldiers, like as many blood-hounds, were diſperſed over the country in ſearch of thoſe who fled. The&nbsp;neighbouring towns, villages, and all the highways,&nbsp;ſwarmed with aſſaſſins ; and on this occaſion Plutarch&nbsp;obſerves with great concern, that the moſt ſacred ties&nbsp;of friendſhip and hoſpitality are not proof againſt treachery, in the day of adverſity, for there were but very&nbsp;few who did not diſcover their friends who had fled to&nbsp;them for ſhelter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This ſlaughter being over, Cinna named himſelf and Marius conſuls for the enſuing year ; and theſe tyrants&nbsp;ſeemed reſolved to begin the new year as they had&nbsp;ended the old one : but, while they were preparing to&nbsp;renew their cruelties, Sylla, having proved victorious&nbsp;in the eaſt, ſent a long letter to the ſenate, giving an account of bis many victories, and his reſolution of returning to Rome, not to reſtore peace to his country, but&nbsp;to revenge himſelf of his enemies, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> to deſtroy thoſe&nbsp;whom Marius had ſpared. This letter occaſioned an&nbsp;univerſal terror. Marius, dreading to enter the lifts&nbsp;with ſuch a renowned warrior, gave himſelf up to exceſſive drinking, and died. His ſon was a</span><span class="font0">ſſ</span><span class="font1">ociated with&nbsp;Cinna in the government, though not in the conſulinip,&nbsp;and proved a tyrant no leſs cruel than his father. Thc&nbsp;ſenate declared one Valerius Flaccus general of the forces in the eaſt, and appointed him a conſiderable army ;&nbsp;but the troops alt to a man deſerted him, and joined&nbsp;Sylla. Soon after, Cinna declared himſelf conſul a&nbsp;third time, and took for his colleague Papirius Carbo ;&nbsp;but the citizens, dreading the tyranny of theſe inhuman&nbsp;monſters, fled in crowds to Sylla, who was now in&nbsp;Greece. To him the ſenate ſent deputies, begging&nbsp;that he would have compaſſion on his country, and not&nbsp;carry his reſentment to ſuch a length as to begin a civil war : but he replied, that he was coming to Rome&nbsp;full of rage and revenge ; 'and that all his enemies, if&nbsp;the Roman people conſented to it, ſhould periſh either&nbsp;by the ſword or the axes of the executioners. Upon&nbsp;this ſeveral very numerous armies were formed againſt&nbsp;him ; but, through the miſconduct of the generals who&nbsp;commanded them, theſe armies were everywhere dé-feated, or went over to the enemy. Pompey, afterwards ſtyled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">the Great,</span><span class="font1"> ſignalized<sup>,</sup> himſelf in this war,&nbsp;and embraced the party of Sylla. The Italian nations&nbsp;took ſome one ſide and ſome another, as their different&nbsp;inclinations led them. Cinna, in the mean time, was&nbsp;killed in a tumult, and young Marius and Carbo&nbsp;ſucceeded him ; but the former having ventured&nbsp;an engagement with Sylla, was by him defeated,&nbsp;and forced </span><span class="font0">to fly to Præneite, where </span><span class="font1">he </span><span class="font0">was cloſely&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">beſieged..</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus was Rome reduced to the loweſt degree of miſery, when one Pontius Teleſinus, a Samnite of great&nbsp;experience in war, projected the total ruin of the 'city.&nbsp;He had joined, or pretended to join, the generals of&nbsp;the Marian faction with an army of 40,000 men ; and&nbsp;therefore marched towards Praeneſte, as if he deſigned&nbsp;to relieve Marius. By th13 means he drew Sylla and&nbsp;Pompey away from the capital ; and then, decamping&nbsp;in the night, over reached theſe two generals, and by&nbsp;break of day was within 10 furlongs of the Collatine&nbsp;gate. He then pulled off the maik ; and declaring&nbsp;himſelf as much an enemy to Marius as to Sylla, told&nbsp;his troops, that it was not bis deſign to aſſiſt one Roman againſt another, but to deſtroy the whole race,&nbsp;<sup>u</sup> Let fire and ſword (ſaid he) deſtroy all ; let no quarter be given ; mankind can never be free as long as one&nbsp;Roman is left alive.”—Never had this proud metropolis been in greater danger ; nor ever had any city a more&nbsp;narrow eſcape. The Roman youth marched out to&nbsp;oppoſe him, but were driven back with great ſlaughter.&nbsp;Sylla himſelf was defeated, and forced to fly to his&nbsp;camp. Teleſinus advanced with more fury than ever ;&nbsp;but, in the mean time, the other wing of his army having been defeated by M. Craſſus, the victorious general attacked the body where Teleſinus commanded, and&nbsp;by putting· them to flight, ſaved his country from the&nbsp;moſt imminent danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sylla, having now no enemy to fear, marched firſt to Atemnæ, and thence to Rome. From the former&nbsp;•city he carried 8000 priſoners to Rome, and cauſed&nbsp;them all to be maſſacred at once in the circus. His&nbsp;cruelty next fell upon the Prasneſtines, 12,oco of whom&nbsp;were maſſacred without mercy. Young Marius had&nbsp;killed himſelf, in order to avoid falling into the hands&nbsp;of ſuch a cruel enemy. Soon after, the inhabitants of&nbsp;Norba, a city of Campania, finding themſelves unable&nbsp;to reſiſt the forces of the tyrant, ſet fire to their houſes»&nbsp;and all periſhed in the flames. The taking of theſe&nbsp;cities put an end to the civil war, but not to the cruelties ol Sylla. Having aſſembled the people in the co-mitium, he told the·/, that he was reſolved not to ſpare&nbsp;a ſingle perſon who had borne arms againſt him. This&nbsp;cruel reſolution he put in execution with the moſt unrelenting vigour ; and having at laſt cut off all thoſe&nbsp;who n he thought capable of oppoſing him, Sylla&nbsp;cauſed hin ſelf to be declared perpetual dictator,&nbsp;or, in other words, king and abſolute ſovereign </span><span class="font0">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This revolution happened about 80 B. C. and from this time we may date the loſs of the Ro nan liberty.&nbsp;Sylla indeed reſigned his power in two years ; but the&nbsp;citizens of Rone having once ſubmitted, were ever&nbsp;after n ore inclined to ſubmit to a maſter. Though&nbsp;individuals retained the ſame enthuſiaſtic notions of liberty as before, yet the minds of the generality ſeem&nbsp;fro n this time to have inclined towards monarchy«,&nbsp;New maſters were indeed already prepared for the republic. Cæ</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ar and Fompey had eminently diſtinguiſhed the Helves by their martial exploits, and were&nbsp;already rivals. They were, however, for ſo e ti ne&nbsp;prevented froτι raiſing any diſturbances by being kept&nbsp;at a diſtance ſrom each other. Sertorius, one of the&nbsp;generals of the Marian faction, and the only one of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">them poſſeſſed either of honour or probity, had retired</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
