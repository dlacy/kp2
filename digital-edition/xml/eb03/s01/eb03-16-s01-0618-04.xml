: A genus of the digynia order, belonging to the pentandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 12th order, <hi rend="italic">Holoraceae.</hi> The calyx is pentaphyllous; there is no corolla; the capſule is monoſpermous, with a ſcrewed ſeed.</p><p>The ſpecies are, 1. The kali, which grows naturally in the ſalt marſhes in divers parts of England. It is an annual plant, which riſes above five or fix inches high, fending out many ſide branches, which ſpread on every fide, garniſhed with ſhort awl-ſhaped leaves; which are fleſhy, and terminate in acute ſpines. The flowers are produced from the fide of the branches, to which they ſit cloſe, and are encompaſſed by ſhort prickly leaves; they are ſmall, and of an herbaceous colour. The feeds are wrapped up in the empalement of the flower, and ripen in autumn; ſoon after which the plant decays. 2. The tragus grows naturally on the ſandy ſhores of the ſouth of France, Spain, and Italy. This is alſo an annual plant, which ſends out many diſſuſed ſtalks, garniſhed with linear leaves an inch long, ending with ſharp ſpines. The flowers come out from the ſide of the ſtalks in the ſame manner as thoſe of the former; their empalements are blunt, and not ſo cloſely encompaſſed with leaves as thoſe of the other.</p><p>3. The ſoda, riſes with herbaceous ſtalks near three feet high, ſpreading wide. The leaves on the principal ſtalk, and thoſe on the lower part of the branches, are long, ſlender, and have no ſpines; thoſe on the upper part of the ſtalk and branches are ſlender, ſhort, and crooked. At the baſe of the leaves are produced the flowers, which are ſmall, and hardly perceptible; the empalement of the flower afterwards encom- paſſes the capſule, which contains one cochleated feed.</p><p>4. The vermiculata grows naturally in Spain. This hath ſhrubby perennial ſtalks, which riſe three or four feet high, fending out many ſide-branches, garniſhed with fleſhy, oval, acute-pointed leaves, coming out in cluſters from the ſide of the branches; they are hoary, and have ſtiff prickles. The flowers are produced from between the leaves toward the ends of the branches; they are ſo ſmall as ſcarce to be diſcerned, unleſs they are cloſely viewed. The ſeeds are like thoſe of the other kinds. 5. The roſacea grows naturally in Tartary. This is an annual plant, whoſe ſtalks are herbaceous, and ſeldom riſe more than five or fix inches high. The leaves are awl-ſhaped, ending in acute points; the empalements of the flowers ſpread open: the flowers are ſmall, and of a roſe colour, but ſoon fade: the ſeeds are like thoſe of the other forts.</p><p>All the forts of glaſs-wort are ſometimes promiſcuouſly uſed for making the ſal kali, but it is the third fort which is eſteemed beſt for this purpoſe. The manner of making it is as follows: Having dug a trench<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0625.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0619"/>
near the ſea, they place laths acroſs it, on which they lay the herb in heaps, and, having made a fire below, the liquor, which runs out of the herbs, drops to the bottom, which at length thickening, becomes ſal kali, which is partly of a black, and partly of an aſh-colour, very ſharp and corroſive, and of a ſaltiſh taſte. This, when thoroughly hardened, becomes like a ſtone; and in that ſtate is tranſported to different countries for making of glaſs.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
