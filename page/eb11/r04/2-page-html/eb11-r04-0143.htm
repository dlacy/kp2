<p><span class="font0">Even more ominous of coming danger was the extent to which the European’half of the empire was becoming barbarized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The policy which had been inaugurated by Augustus himself of settling barbarians within the frontiers&nbsp;had been taken up on a larger scale and in a more&nbsp;systematic way by the Illyrian emperors of the 3rd&nbsp;century, and was continued by their successors in&nbsp;the 4th. In Gaul, in the provinces south of the Danube, even in&nbsp;Macedon and Italy, large barbarian settlements had been made&nbsp;—Theodosius in particular distinguishing himself by his liberality in this respect. Nor did the barbarians admitted&nbsp;during the 4th century merely swell the class of half-servile </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coloni.</span><span class="font0"> On the contrary, they not only constituted&nbsp;to an increasing extent the strength of the imperial forces,&nbsp;but won their way in ever-growing numbers to posts of&nbsp;dignity and importance in the imperial service. Under&nbsp;Constantine the palace was crowded with Franks.@@<sup>1</sup> Julian&nbsp;led Gothic troops against Persia, and the army with&nbsp;which Theodosius defeated the tyrant Maximus (388)&nbsp;contained large numbers of Huns and Alans, as well as of&nbsp;Goths. The names of Arbogast, Stilicho and Rufinus are&nbsp;sufficient proof of the place held by barbarians near the&nbsp;emperor’s person and in the control of the provinces and&nbsp;legions of Rome; and the relations of Arbogast to his nominee&nbsp;for the purple, Eugenius, were an anticipation of those which&nbsp;existed between Ricimer and the emperors of the latter half</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the 5 th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was by barbarians already settled within the empire that the first of the series of attacks which finally separated the&nbsp;western provinces from the empire and set up a barbaric ruler in Italy were made, and it was in men of&nbsp;barbarian birth that Rome found her ablest and most&nbsp;successful defenders. The Visigoths whom Alaric led into&nbsp;Italy had been settled south of the Danube as the&nbsp;allies of the empire since the accession of Theodosius.&nbsp;But, like the Germans of the days of Caesar,&nbsp;they wanted land for their own, and Alaric himself aspired to&nbsp;raise himself to the heights which had been reached before him&nbsp;by the Vandal Stilicho at Ravenna and the Goth Rufinus&nbsp;at Constantinople. The jealousy which existed between the&nbsp;rulers of the western and eastern empires furthered his plans.&nbsp;In the name of Arcadius, the emperor of the east, or at least&nbsp;with the connivance of Arcadius’s minister Rufinus, he occupied&nbsp;the province of Illyricum, and from thence ravaged Greece,&nbsp;which, according to the existing division of provinces, belonged&nbsp;to the western empire. Thence in 396 he retreated before&nbsp;Stilicho to Illyricum, with the command of which he was now&nbsp;formally invested by Arcadius; he thus gained a base of operations against Italy.@@<sup>2</sup> In 400 he led his people, with their wives&nbsp;and families, their wagons and treasure, to seek lands for&nbsp;themselves south of the Alps. But in this first invasion he&nbsp;penetrated no farther than the plains of Lombardy, and after&nbsp;the desperate battle of Pollentia (402 or 403) he slowly withdrew from Italy, his retreat being hastened by the promises&nbsp;of gold freely made to him by the imperial government. Not&nbsp;until the autumn of 408 did Alaric again cross the Alps.&nbsp;Stilicho was dead; the barbarian troops in Honorius’s service&nbsp;had been provoked into joining Alaric by the anti-Teutonic&nbsp;policy of Honorius and his ministers, and Alaric marched .unopposed to Rome. The payment of a heavy ransom, however,&nbsp;saved the city. Negotiations followed between Alaric and&nbsp;the court of Ravenna. Alaric’s demands were moderate,&nbsp;but Honorius would grant neither lands for his people nor the&nbsp;honourable post in the imperial service which he asked for himself. Once more Alaric sat down before Rome, and the citizens&nbsp;were forced to agree to his terms. Attalus, a Greek, the prefect&nbsp;of the city, was declared Augustus, and Alaric accepted the&nbsp;post of commander-in-chief. But after a few months Alaric&nbsp;formally deposed Attalus, on account of his incapacity, and&nbsp;renewed his offers to Honorius. Again they were declined,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">and Alaric marched to the siege and sack of Rome (410).@@<sup>3</sup> His death followed hard on his capture of Rome. Two&nbsp;years later (412) his successor Ataulf led the Visigoths to find in Gaul the lands which Alaric had&nbsp;sought in Italy. It is characteristic of the anarchical&nbsp;condition of the west that Ataulf and his Goths should&nbsp;have fought for Honorius in Gaul against the tyrants@@<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;and in Spain against the Vandals, Suebi and Alani; and&nbsp;it was with the consent of Honorius that in 419 Wallia,&nbsp;who had followed Ataulf as king of the Visigoths, finally&nbsp;settled with his people in south-western Gaul and founded&nbsp;the Visigothic monarchy.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was about the same period that the accomplished fact of the division of Spain between the three barbarian tribes of&nbsp;Vandals, Suebi and Alani was in a similar manner&nbsp;recognized by the paramount authority of the emperor&nbsp;of the west.@@<sup>6</sup> These peoples had crossed the Rhine&nbsp;at the time when Alaric was making his first attempt&nbsp;on Italy. A portion of the host led by Radagaisus@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>actually invaded Italy, but was cut to pieces by Stilicho&nbsp;near Florence (405); the rest pressed on through Gaul, crossed&nbsp;the Pyrenees, and entered the as yet untouched province of&nbsp;Spain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Honorius died in 423. With the single exception of Britain@@<sup>8</sup> no province had yet formally broken loose from the empire.&nbsp;But over a great part of the west the authority of the&nbsp;emperors was now little more than nominal; throughout the major part of Gaul and in Spain the barbarians&nbsp;had settled, and barbarian states were. growing up which&nbsp;recognized the supremacy of the emperor, but were in all&nbsp;essentials independent of his control.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The long reign of Valentiman III. (423-55) is marked by two events of first-rate importance—the conquest of Africa by&nbsp;the Vandals @@<sup>9</sup> and the invasion of Gaul and Italy by&nbsp;Attila. The Vandal settlement in Africa was closely&nbsp;akin in its origin and results to those of the Visigoths and of the Vandals themselves in Gaul and&nbsp;Spain. Here, as there, the occasion was given by&nbsp;the jealous quarrels of powerful imperial ministers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The feud between Boniface, count of Africa, and Aetius, the “ master-general ” or “ count of Italy,” opened the way to&nbsp;Africa for the Vandal king Gaiseric (Genseric), as that between&nbsp;Stilicho and Rufinus had before set Alaric in motion westward, and as the quarrel between the tyrant Constantine and&nbsp;the ministers of Honorius had paved the way for the Vandals,&nbsp;Suebes and Alans into Spain. In this case, too, land-hunger&nbsp;was the impelb'ng motive with the barbarian invader, and in&nbsp;Africa, as in Gaul and Spain, the invaders’ acquisitions were&nbsp;confirmed by the imperial authority which they still professed&nbsp;to recognize. In 429 Gaiseric, king of the Vandals, crossed&nbsp;with his warriors, their families and goods, to the province&nbsp;of Africa, hitherto almost untouched by the ravages of war.&nbsp;Thanks to the quarrels of Boniface and Aetius, their task&nbsp;was an easy one. The province was quickly overrun. In&nbsp;435 @@<sup>10</sup> a formal treaty secured them in the possession of a&nbsp;large portion of the rich lands which were the granary of&nbsp;Rome, in exchange for a payment probably of corn and oil.&nbsp;Carthage was taken in 439, and by 440 the Vandal kingdom&nbsp;was firmly established.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
