<p><span class="font0">to the participants, being overlaid by its traditional character, which but guarantees a general efficacy. “ Blessings come,&nbsp;evils go,” may be said to be the magico-religious formula&nbsp;implicit in all socially approved dealings with the sacred,&nbsp;however specialized in semblance. (2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ambiguity.</span><span class="font0"> Mystic&nbsp;potency, however, because of the very indefiniteness of its&nbsp;action, is a two-edged sword. The sacred is not to be approached&nbsp;lightly. It will heal or blast, according as it is handled with&nbsp;or without due circumspection. That which is taboo, for&nbsp;instance, the person of the king, or woman’s blood, is poison or&nbsp;medicine according as it is manipulated, being inherently just&nbsp;a potentiality for wonder-working in any direction. Not but&nbsp;what primitive thought shows a tendency to mark off a certain&nbsp;kind of mystic power as wholly bad by a special name, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">arungquiltha of</span><span class="font0"> Central Australia; and here, we may note, we&nbsp;come nearest to a conception of magic as something other than&nbsp;religion, the trafficker in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">arungquiltha</span><span class="font0"> being socially suspect, nay,&nbsp;liable to persecution, and even death (as amongst the Arunta&nbsp;tribe, see Spencer and Gillen, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Native Tribes of</span><span class="font0"> C. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Australia,</span><span class="font0"> 536),&nbsp;at the hands of his fellows. On the other hand, wholly beneficent&nbsp;powers seem hardly to be recognized, unless we find them in&nbsp;beings such as Mungan-ngaur (“ father-our” ), who derive an&nbsp;ethical character from their association with the initiation ceremonies and the moral instruction given thereat (cf. Lang, Z.c.).&nbsp;(3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Relativity.</span><span class="font0"> So far we have tended to represent the activity of&nbsp;the sacred as that of a universal force, somewhat in the style of&nbsp;our “ electricity” or “ mind. ” It remains to add that this activity&nbsp;manifests itself at numberless independent centres. These&nbsp;differ amongst themselves in the degree of their energy. One&nbsp;spell is stronger than another, one taboo more inviolable than&nbsp;another. Dr W. H. R. Rivers </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{The Todas,</span><span class="font0"> 448) gives an interesting analysis of the grades of sanctity apparent in Toda religion.&nbsp;The gods of the hill-tops come first. The sacred buffaloes,&nbsp;their milk, their bells, the dairies and their vessels are on a&nbsp;lower plane; whilst we may note that there are several grades&nbsp;amongst the dairies, increase of sanctity going with elaboration&nbsp;of dairy ritual (cf. ibid. 232). Still lower is the dairyman, who&nbsp;is in no way divine, yet has sanctity as one who maintains&nbsp;a condition of ceremonial purity. (4) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Transmissibility.</span><span class="font0"> If,&nbsp;however, this activity originates at certain centres, it tends to&nbsp;spread therefrom in all directions. Dr F. B. Jevons (in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">An&nbsp;Introduction to the History of Religion,</span><span class="font0"> vii.) distinguishes between&nbsp;“ things taboo,” which have the mystic contagion inherent in&nbsp;them, and “ things tabooed,” to which the taboo-infection has&nbsp;been transmitted. In the former class he places supernatural&nbsp;beings (including men with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mana</span><span class="font0"> as well as ghosts and spirits),&nbsp;blood, new-born children with their mothers, and corpses;&nbsp;which list might be considerably extended, for instance, by the&nbsp;inclusion of natural portents, and animals and plants such as are&nbsp;strikingly odd, dangerous or useful. Any one of these can pass&nbsp;on its sacred quality to other persons and objects (as a corpse&nbsp;defiles the mourner and his clothes), nay to actions, places and&nbsp;times as well (as a corpse will likewise cause work to be tabooed,&nbsp;ground to be set apart, a holy season to be observed). Such&nbsp;Iransmissibility is commonly explained by the association of&nbsp;ideas, that becoming sacred which as it were reminds one of&nbsp;the sacred; though it is important to add, firstly, that such&nbsp;association takes place under the influence of a selective interest&nbsp;generated by strong religious feeling, and, secondly, that this&nbsp;interest is primarily a collective product, being governed by a&nbsp;social tradition which causes certain possibilities of ideal combination alone to be realized, whilst it is the chief guarantee of&nbsp;the objectivity of what they suggest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Exploitation of the Sacred.</span><span class="font0"> A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Methods.</span><span class="font0">—It is hard to find terms general enough to cover dealings with the sacred that&nbsp;range from the manipulation of an almost inanimate type of&nbsp;power to intercourse modelled on that between man and man.&nbsp;Primitive religion, however, resorts to either way of approach&nbsp;so indifferently as to prove that there is little or no awareness&nbsp;of an inconsistency of attitude. The radical contrast between&nbsp;mechanical and spiritual religion, though fundamental for&nbsp;modern theology, is alien to the primitive point of view, and is&nbsp;therefore inappropriate to the purposes of anthropological&nbsp;description. (1) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acquisition.</span><span class="font0"> Mystic power may be regarded&nbsp;as innate so far as skill, luck or queerness are signs and conditions of its presence. On the whole, however, savage society&nbsp;tends to regard it as something acquired, the product of acts and&nbsp;abstinences having a traditional character for imparting magico-religious virtue. An external symbol in the shape of a ceremony&nbsp;or cult-object is of great assistance to the dim eye of primitive&nbsp;faith. Again, the savage universe is no preserve of man, but&nbsp;is an open field wherein human and non-human activities of&nbsp;all sorts compete on more or less equal terms, yet so that a&nbsp;certain measure of predominance may be secured by a judicious&nbsp;combination of forces. (2) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Concentration.</span><span class="font0"> Hence the magico-religious society or individual practitioner piles ceremony on&nbsp;ceremony, name of power on name of power, relic on relic, to&nbsp;consolidate the forces within reach and assume direction thereof.&nbsp;The transmissihility of the sacred ensures the fusion of powers&nbsp;drawn from all sources, however disparate. (3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Induction.</span><span class="font0"> It&nbsp;is necessary, however, as it were to bring this force to a head.&nbsp;This would appear to be the essential significance of sacrifice,&nbsp;where a number of sacred operations and instruments are made&nbsp;to discharge their efficacy into the victim as into a vat, so that a&nbsp;blessing-yielding, evil-neutralizing force of highest attainable&nbsp;potency is obtained (see H. Hubert and M. Mauss, “ Essai sur&nbsp;la nature et la fonction du sacrifice” in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">L' Année sociologique,</span><span class="font0"> ii.).&nbsp;(4) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Renovation.</span><span class="font0"> An important </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">motif</span><span class="font0"> in magico-religious ritual,&nbsp;which may not have been without effect on the development of&nbsp;sacrifice, is, as Dr Frazer’s main thesis in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Golden Boiigh&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">asserts, the imparting of reproductive energy to animals, plants&nbsp;and man himself, its cessation being suggested by such phenomena&nbsp;as old age and the fall of the year. To concentrate, induce and&nbsp;renovate are, however, but aspects of one process of acquisition&nbsp;by the transfusion of a transmissible energy. (5) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Demission.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Hubert and Mauss show in their penetrating analysis of sacrifice&nbsp;that after the rite has been brought to its culminating point&nbsp;there follows as a pendant a ceremony of re-entry into ordinary&nbsp;life, the idea of which is preserved in the Christian formula&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ite, missa est.</span><span class="font0"> (6) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Insidation.</span><span class="font0"> Such deposition of sacredness&nbsp;is but an aspect of the wider method that causes a ring-fence to&nbsp;be erected round the sacred to ward off casual trespassers at&nbsp;once in their own interest and to prevent contamination. We&nbsp;see here a natural outcome of religious awe supported by the&nbsp;spirit of esotericism, and by a sense of the need for an expert&nbsp;handling of that which is so potent for good or ill. (7) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Direction.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">This last consideration brings to notice the fact that throughout&nbsp;magico-religious practice of all kinds the human operator retains&nbsp;a certain control over the issue. In the numberless transitions&nbsp;that, whilst connecting, separate the spell and the prayer we&nbsp;observe as the accompaniment of every mood from extreme&nbsp;imperiousness to extreme humility an abiding will and desire&nbsp;to help the action out. Even “ Thy will be done ” preserves&nbsp;the echo of a direction, and, needless to say, this is hardly a&nbsp;form of primitive address. At the bottom is the vague feeling&nbsp;that it is man’s own self-directed mysterious energy that is at&nbsp;work, however much it needs to be reinforced from without.&nbsp;Meanwhile, tradition strictly prescribes the ways and means of&nbsp;such reinforcement, so that religion becomes largely a matter&nbsp;of sacred lore; and the expert director of rites, who is likewise&nbsp;usually at this stage the leader of society, comes more and more&nbsp;to be needed as an intermediary between the lay portion of the&nbsp;community and the sacred powers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">B. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Results.</span><span class="font0">—Hitherto our account of primitive religion has had to move on somewhat abstract lines. His religion&nbsp;is, however, anything but an abstraction to the savage, and&nbsp;stands rather for the whole of his concrete life so far as it is&nbsp;penetrated by a spirit of earnest endeavour. The end and&nbsp;result of primitive religion is, in a word, the consecration of&nbsp;life, the stimulation of the will to live and to do. This&nbsp;bracing of the vital feeling takes place by means of imaginative&nbsp;appeal to the great forces man perceives stirring within him&nbsp;and about him, such appeal proving effective doubtless by&nbsp;reason of the psychological law that to conceive strongly is</span></p>
