<p><span class="font0">did in an Indian canoe, we cannot ſuppoſe that he had much leiſure or conveniency for calculations, and therefore are not ſurpriſed that he did not ſee that even this&nbsp;circumſtance was of little avail in ſo ſmall or ſhallow a&nbsp;body of water. He carefully noted, however, the times&nbsp;of high and low water as he paſſed along. When arrived at Para, he found not only that the high water&nbsp;was later and later as we are farther from the mouth,&nbsp;but he found that at one and the ſame inſtant there&nbsp;were ſeveral points oſhigh water between Para and the&nbsp;confluence of the Madeira, with points of low water intervening. This concluſion was eaſily drawn from his&nbsp;own obſervations, although he could not fee at one in-ſlant the high waters in different places. He had only&nbsp;to compute the time of high water at a particular ſpot,&nbsp;on the day he obſerved it at another ; allowing, as&nbsp;uſual, for the moon’s change of poſition. The reſult&nbsp;of his obſervations therefore was, that the ſurface of&nbsp;the river was not an inclined plane whoſe ſlope was leſ-ſened by the tide of flood at the mouth of the river, but&nbsp;that it was a waving line, and that the propagation of&nbsp;the tide up the river was nothing different from the propagation of any other wave. We may conceive it&nbsp;clearly, though imperfectly, in this way. Let the place&nbsp;be noted where the tide happens 12 hours later than at&nbsp;the mouth of the river. It is evident that there is alſo&nbsp;a tide at the very mouth at ⅝he ſame inſtant; and, ſince&nbsp;the ocean tide had withdrawn itſelf during the time&nbsp;that the former tide had proceeded ſo far up the river,&nbsp;and the tide of ebb is ſucceſſively felt above as well as&nbsp;the tide of flood, there muſt be a low water between&nbsp;theſe two high waters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Newton had pointed out this curious ſact, and obſerved that the tide at London-Bridge, which is 43 feet above the ſea, is not the ſame with that at Graveſ-end, but the preceding tide (See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Phil. Tranſ 6q.)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">This will be more particularly infilled on in another&nbsp;place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not far from the head of the Maragnon, the Cordilleras fend off a branch to the north-eaſt, which reaches and ranges along the ſhore of the Mexican Gulf, and&nbsp;the Rio Grande de Sta Martha occupies the angle betweeen the ridges.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another ridge ranges with interruptions along the eaſt coaſt of Terra Firma, ſo that the whole waters of&nbsp;this country are collected into the Oroonoko. In like&nbsp;manner the north and eaſt of Braſil are hemmed in by&nbsp;mountainous ridges, through which there is no conſiderable paſſage ; and the ground ſloping backwards, all&nbsp;The waters of this immenſe track are collected from&nbsp;both ſides by many conſiderable rivers into the great&nbsp;river Paraguay, or Rio de la Plata, which runs down&nbsp;the middle of this country for more than 1400 miles,&nbsp;and falls into the ſea through a vaſt mouth in latitude&nbsp;35°'</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus the whole of South America ſeems as if it had been formerly ſurrounded by a mound, and been a great&nbsp;baſon. The ground in the middle, where the Parama,&nbsp;the Madeira, and the Plata, take their riſe, is an immenſe marſh, uninhabitable for its exhalations, and quite&nbsp;impervious in its preſent ſtate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The manner in which the continent of North America is watered, or rather drained, has alſo ſome peculiarities. By looking at the map, one will obſerve firſt of all a general diviſion of the whole of the beſt known&nbsp;part into two, by the valleys in which the beds of the&nbsp;river St Laurence and Miſſiſſippi are ſituated. The head&nbsp;of this is occupied by a ſingular ſeries of freſh water&nbsp;ſeas or lakes, viz. the lake Superior and Michigan,&nbsp;which empty themſelves into lake Huron by two cata-<sup>,</sup>racts. This again runs into lake Erie by the river&nbsp;Detroiî, and the Erie pours its waters into the Ontario by the famous fall of Niagara, and from the On*&nbsp;tario proceeds the great river St Laurence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ground to the ſouth-weſt of the lakes Superior and Erie is ſomewhat lower, and the middle of the valley is occupied by the Miſſiſſippi and the Miſſoure, which&nbsp;receive on both ſides a number of ſmaller ſtreams, and&nbsp;having joined, proceed to the ſouth, under the name&nbsp;Miſſiſſippi. In latitude 37, this river receives into its&nbsp;bed the Ohio, a river of equal magnitude, and the Cherokee river, which drains all the country lying at the&nbsp;back of the United States, ſeparated from them by the&nbsp;ranges of the Apalachian mountains. The Miſſiſſippi is&nbsp;now one of the chief rivers on the globe, and proceeds&nbsp;due ſouth, till it falls into the Mexican bay through ſeveral ſhifting mouths, which greatly reſemble thoſe of&nbsp;the Danube and the Nile, having run above 1200&nbsp;miles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The elevated country between this bed of the Miſſiſſippi and St Laurence and the Atlantic ocean is drained on the eaſt ſide by a great number of rivers, ſome of which are very conſiderable, and of long courſe ; becauſe inſtead of being nearly at right angles to the&nbsp;coaſt, as in other countries, they are in a great meaſure&nbsp;parallel to it. This is more remarkably the caſe with&nbsp;Hudſon’s river, the Delaware, Patomacſk, Rapahanoc,&nbsp;&amp;c. Indeed the whole of North America ſeems to&nbsp;conſiſt of ribs or beams laid nearly parallel to each&nbsp;other from north to ſouth, and the rivers occupy the&nbsp;interſtices. All thoſe which empty themſelves into the&nbsp;bay of Mexico are parallel and almoſt perfectly ſtraight,&nbsp;unlike what are ſeen in other parts of the world. The&nbsp;weſtermoſt of them all, the North River, as it is named&nbsp;by the Spaniards, is nearly as long as the Miſſiſſippi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We are very little informed as yet of the diſtribution of rivers on the north-weſt coaſt of America, or the courſe of thoſe which run into Hudſon’s and Baffin’s bay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Maragnon is undoubtedly the greateſt river in the world, both as to length of run and the vaſt body&nbsp;of water which it rolls along. The other great rivers&nbsp;ſucceed nearly in the following order.</span></p>
