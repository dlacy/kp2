<p><span class="font2">those who were to enjoy in future the privileges of quiritarian right, —and multiplying the sources of future disputes that would have&nbsp;to be determined by the tribunals. The nature of thd jurisdiction&nbsp;created by him, if any, to meet the new aspect of things is much&nbsp;controverted. He has been credited with the institution of the&nbsp;collegiate courts of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Centumviri</span><span class="font2"> and the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Decemviri (stlitibus&nbsp;judicandis)</span><span class="font2"> as well as the private judge </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(unus judex),</span><span class="font2"> but the arguments in support of this view are not strong, and arc, of course,&nbsp;based wholly on presumptions. However, it will be convenient to&nbsp;say a few words about each of these courts here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The centumviral court<sup>@@1</sup> is often referred to by Cicero, and the range of its jurisdiction in his time seems to have included every&nbsp;possible question of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font2"> in the old sense of the word—&nbsp;status of individuals, property and its casements, and&nbsp;inheritance whether testate or intestate. By. the time&nbsp;of Gaius the only matters apparently that were in practice&nbsp;brought before it were questions of inheritance by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">though theoretically it was still competent in all real actions., and&nbsp;the lance, the emblem of quiritarian right generally, was still its&nbsp;ensign. During the later Republic the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Centumviri</span><span class="font2"> formed a quasi-corporate body of private judges selected originally from the tribes&nbsp;(afterwards from the ordinary list of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">judices)</span><span class="font2"> annually by the urban</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">p</span><span class="font2">raetors.<sup>@@2</sup> Some writers identify the centumviral court with the omulian senate of ioo; others attribute its institution to Servius&nbsp;Tullius and hold that it was a plebeian court at first; others make&nbsp;it contemporaneous with the All. Tables; others bring it down&nbsp;to the 6th century of the city; while the weight of recent authority&nbsp;is in favour of the view that it is not earlier than the beginning of&nbsp;the 7th century.. The arguments in support of these several views&nbsp;cannot be gone into here. It is enough to say that we have no&nbsp;positive proof of its existence earlier than the 7th century, though&nbsp;presumptions are in favour of its having been somewhat earlier.&nbsp;In the exercise of their office the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Centumviri</span><span class="font2"> acted more independently than private judices ventured to do, and even introduced&nbsp;some considerable reforms into the law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There was a court at Rome during the Republic called the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Decemviri stlitibus judicandis.<sup>@@3</sup></span><span class="font2"> These decemvirs in historic times constituted a quasi-corporate body of judicial magistrates,&nbsp;whose duty it was to try certain kinds of actions, especially&nbsp;those relating to personal liberty. During the Princi-pate, while ceasing to. act as a separate court, they presided over the divisions into which the centumviral court had been&nbsp;under Augustus divided. Their origin is quite unknown. Pom-poni.us indeed says that they were originally created soon after&nbsp;the institution of the peregrin praetorship in 242 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.</span><span class="font2"> for this very&nbsp;purpose of presiding over centumviral cases,<sup>@@4</sup> but this statement&nbsp;is generally discredited and, if true, their practice of so presiding&nbsp;must quickly have gone into disuse. Those writers who attempt&nbsp;to trace back the centumvirs to the regal period give, as a rule,&nbsp;a like antiquity to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Decemviri stlitibus judicandis.</span><span class="font2"> On the other&nbsp;hand, some authorities identify them with the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">decemviri judices&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">mentioned by Livy<sup>@@5</sup> as having been declared by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lex Valeria-Il or alia</span><span class="font2"> to be as sacrosanct as the tribunes of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plebs.</span><span class="font2"> But&nbsp;these latter judices seem to have been a purely plebeian court&nbsp;which early went into desuetude, and there is really no evidence of&nbsp;identity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">So far back as historic evidence goes we find that actions were tried and judgments pronounced by </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">judices</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">arbitri.</span><span class="font2"> There&nbsp;never was more than a single judge </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(unus</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">unicus judex)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">appointed to try a case, but there might be more than one&nbsp;arbiter, and frequently there were three. All kinds of&nbsp;actions, even a sacramental action </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in rem,</span><span class="font2"> could be brought&nbsp;before the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">unus judex,</span><span class="font2"> but especially appropriate to him were all&nbsp;personal claims of alleged indebtedness, whether arising out of a&nbsp;legal or illegal act, denied either </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in toto</span><span class="font2"> or only as to the amount.&nbsp;Matters of that sort involved as a rule no general principle of law&nbsp;but rather mere disputes as to facts, which could well be decided&nbsp;by a. single individual. There is much more reason for crediting&nbsp;Servius with the institution of the single judge (the arbiters may&nbsp;have been a creation of the Xll. Tables) than with either of the&nbsp;collegiate courts. If we believe that in the early regal period the&nbsp;king acting with the pontiffs kept all jurisdiction in his own hands,&nbsp;it is plain that this must have become a practical impossibility after&nbsp;the admission of the plebeians to citizenship. For the trial of&nbsp;disputed facts it would be necessary to delegate jurisdiction, and&nbsp;the earliest </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">judices</span><span class="font2"> may have been the king’s commissioners for&nbsp;such cases. If this be right, it was the beginning of a system that&nbsp;bore wondrous fruit in after years, and that, as will be shown in&nbsp;the sequel, helped the praetors to build up, through </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">formulae,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the whole body of equity.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font2">II. The Jus Civile</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">(From the establishment of the Republic until the subjugation of central and southern Italy.)&nbsp;i. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ConstiMional Events affecting the Law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jus Civile contrasted with Jus Quiritium.—</span><span class="font2">The term </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font2"> as used to designate this chapter, though almost synonymous with, may be taken as somewhat more comprehensive than, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus Quiritium.</span><span class="font2"> It is a term of&nbsp;later origin than the latter. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Jus Quiritium</span><span class="font2"> was&nbsp;based entirely on old custom and legislation, finding, one&nbsp;might say, its culmination in the XII. Tables; whereas in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font2"> as here understood, there appears the element&nbsp;of doctrinal interpretation of both statute and custom—the&nbsp;magistrates and jurists (particularly the pontiffs) adding&nbsp;much to the earlier law by introducing into it this element.&nbsp;We can say that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font2"> in this sense is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus Quiritium&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">as developed by interpretation. It is as yet, however, little&nbsp;influenced, as was the more comprehensive </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile</span><span class="font2"> of later&nbsp;periods, by the elements of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus gentium</span><span class="font2"> and equity. Still&nbsp;: nowhere, we must note, are the terms </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus Quiritium</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;civile</span><span class="font2"> placed in contrast by the jurists; they were each </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus&nbsp;proprium civium Romanorum.</span><span class="font2"> In the classical law the term&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus Quiritium</span><span class="font2"> seems to be used principally in formulae framed&nbsp;in accordance with old custom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Though our information regarding the present period is less legendary than that of the kings, it is still far from being&nbsp;completely authentic, as no original documents&nbsp;belonging to it are extant. There is little dispute&nbsp;among critics that Rome was sacked and burned&nbsp;by the Gauls about 387 b.c. or a few years later, and it is&nbsp;probable that the original pontifical annals </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(annates maximi)&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">upon which Livy and other Roman historians have presumably&nbsp;based their narratives of early history were destroyed at that&nbsp;time along with all other written records. What credence,&nbsp;then, we may give to the ancient historical narratives, for the&nbsp;period of the Republic antecedent to this event, depends&nbsp;largely upon how far the pontífices managed to have their&nbsp;lost records restored. In any case, however, there is sufficient&nbsp;presumptive evidence to warrant belief in such prominent&nbsp;events of the early Republic as the creation of two annually&nbsp;elected patrician consuls, with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font2"> similar to that of the&nbsp;kings, the creation of tribunes of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plebs,</span><span class="font2"> the enactment&nbsp;of the decemviral code, and periodic struggles between&nbsp;patricians and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plebs,</span><span class="font2"> the one to keep and the other to gain&nbsp;political power. To know the exact dates of these events is&nbsp;relatively of little importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Legislation in Favour of the Plebs.—</span><span class="font2">In their uphill battle for social and political equality the plebeians conquered stage&nbsp;by stage. The more important of their successes may here&nbsp;just be mentioned, with all reserve as to credibility, in the&nbsp;order of their traditional dates. By the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lex Valeria (de pro-vocatione)</span><span class="font2"> of 509 b.c. it was provided that no Roman citizen&nbsp;should be deprived of life, liberty or citizenship </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font2"> suffer&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">poena capitis),</span><span class="font2"> or be scourged, by any magistrate within the&nbsp;city, without an appeal </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(provocatio)</span><span class="font2"> to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">comitia centuriata.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">This statute was often referred to by later Romans as a sort&nbsp;of Magna Carta; Livy calls it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">unicum praesidium libertatis.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">In 494 or 471 b.c. the tribunes of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font2"> were created with&nbsp;right of intercession, and about the same time plebeian </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">aediles&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">judices decemviri</span><span class="font2"> (the latter to act as judges or arbiters&nbsp;in litigations); the persons of all these officials being declared&nbsp;inviolable during their tenure of office.
