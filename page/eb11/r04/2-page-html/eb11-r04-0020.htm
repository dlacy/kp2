<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Law of the Family Relations,—</span><span class="font0">So far as appears no serious inroad was made by the XII. Tables on the law affecting husband&nbsp;and wife, unless in the recognition of the legality of&nbsp;so-called “ free ” marriages, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e,</span><span class="font0"> entered into without&nbsp;any solemnity, and not involving that subjection of&nbsp;the wife to the husband </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(manus)</span><span class="font0"> which was a necessary&nbsp;consequence of the patrician confarreation and plebeian coemption. These latter were left untouched, while on the other&nbsp;hand acquisition of marital </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> through </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">usus</span><span class="font0"> was fully&nbsp;recognized. As formerly mentioned, it had become a practice&nbsp;with some of the plebeians to tie the marriage bond rather&nbsp;loosely in the first instance, possibly in consequence of objection&nbsp;by the women (as became quite general even among patricians&nbsp;at a later period) to renounce their independence and right to&nbsp;retain their own property and earnings, but more probably&nbsp;because taking a woman to be merely the mother of children&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(matriinonium)</span><span class="font0"> had been practically forced upon them before&nbsp;coemption had been introduced as a means of making her a&nbsp;lawful wife, and so they had become in a manner habituated&nbsp;to it. But the idea that, as a man might acquire the ownership&nbsp;of a thing to which his legal title was defective by prolonged&nbsp;possession of it, so he might acquire </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> over the woman&nbsp;with whom he had thus informally united himself by prolonged&nbsp;cohabitation with her as his wife had probably matured and&nbsp;become customary law. The Tables accepted it; all that was&nbsp;needed was to define the conditions under which </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> should&nbsp;be held to have been superinduced, and the wife converted from&nbsp;a doubtful </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">uxor</span><span class="font0"> into a lawful </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mater familias.</span><span class="font0"> Hence the provision that, if a woman, married neither by confarreation nor&nbsp;coemption, desired to retain her independence, she must each&nbsp;year absent herself for three consecutive nights from her&nbsp;husband’s house </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(trinoctialis nsurpatio)—</span><span class="font0">twelve months’ uninterrupted cohabitation being required to give him that power&nbsp;over her which would have been created instantly had the&nbsp;marriage been accompanied by either of the recognized solem</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">nities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Amongst the fragments of the Tables so industriously collected there is none that refers to a wife’s marriage portion </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(dos)</span><span class="font0">; but it&nbsp;is hardly conceivable that it was as yet unknown. Justinian says&nbsp;that in ancient times it was regarded as a donation to the husband&nbsp;with his wife, rather than as a separate estate that was to be used&nbsp;by him while the marriage lasted but to revert to her or her representatives on its -dissolution. And it is easy to see that, where&nbsp;there was </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus,</span><span class="font0"> the wife becoming a member of her husband’s&nbsp;family and everything of hers becoming his, such must originally&nbsp;have been its character.<sup>@@1</sup> But even then, when a man gave his&nbsp;daughter </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(filiafamUias)—</span><span class="font0">who could have nothing of her own—in&nbsp;marriage, and promised her husband a portion with her, there&nbsp;must have been.some process of law for compelling him to pay it;&nbsp;and Voigt’s conjecture that an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio dictae dotis</span><span class="font0"> was employed for&nbsp;the purpose has something in its favour.<sup>@@2</sup> As regards divorce,&nbsp;Cicero alludes vaguely to a provision in the Tables about a man&nbsp;depriving his wife of the house-keys and turning her out of doors,&nbsp;with some such words as “ take what is thine and get thee gone.”&nbsp;This can only refer to free or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">non-manus</span><span class="font0"> marriages, but even for&nbsp;hand marriages, while repudiations by husbands (but not by wives)&nbsp;were competent, the statement of the historians is that they were&nbsp;few and far between until the 6th century of the city, and that,&nbsp;until the same date, any man who turned his wife away, however&nbsp;serious the ground, without the cognition of the family council,&nbsp;was liable to penalties at the hands of the censors.<sup>@@3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the two or three provisions of the Tables known to us that affected details of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas,</span><span class="font0"> which itself was assumed to&nbsp;be so well established by customary law as to need no statutory&nbsp;sanction or definition,, one was in the words “ si pater (familias)&nbsp;ter filium venum duuit, a patre filius liber esto.” This came to&nbsp;be construed by the pontifical lawyers as meaning that so powerful&nbsp;was the bond of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas</span><span class="font0"> over a son that it could not be completely loosed until the father had three times gone through the&nbsp;process of fictitious sale by which emancipation was effected. But&nbsp;the conception of the law seems to indicate that its original purpose&nbsp;must have been rather to impose a penalty on the father and confer&nbsp;a benefit on a son </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate,</span><span class="font0"> by declaring him </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ipso jure</span><span class="font0"> free from&nbsp;it on a certain event, than to place difficulties in the way of his&nbsp;emancipation. “ If a house-father have thrice sold his son, the&nbsp;latter shall be free from his father.” It reads as if the intention&nbsp;were to rescue the son from what, by its frequent repetition, was&nbsp;suggestive of a total absence of parental affection rather than&nbsp;reluctant obedience to overwhelming necessity. May not its&nbsp;object have been to restrain the practice, which did not wholly&nbsp;disappear even in the late Empire, of men selling their sons or giving&nbsp;them to their creditors in security of loans—such sales or pledges,&nbsp;at the time of the Tables, being effected only by an actual transfer&nbsp;of the child </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram</span><span class="font0"> as a free bondman </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(in mancipii causa),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">accompanied by, in the case of a loan, a pact for reconveyance&nbsp;when the loan was repaid? Whatever its ratio, however, and&nbsp;whatever the earlier practice, it was upon this law that the interpreting pontiffs based the rules for adoptions and emancipations&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fttiifamilias,</span><span class="font0"> The usual procedure in adoptions was as follows:&nbsp;The natural'father mancipated his .son to a friend for a nominal&nbsp;price and the latter then manumitted. him, the son thereupon&nbsp;reverting into his father’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas.</span><span class="font0"> This was repeated a second&nbsp;time with the same result. After the third sale </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(patria potestas&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">being extinguished) the purchaser remancipated to the parent.&nbsp;In the latter’s hands the son was now </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in causa mancipii,</span><span class="font0"> and so in&nbsp;a position in which he could be permanently transferred to the&nbsp;adopter. This was effected by an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in jure cessio,</span><span class="font0"> in which the&nbsp;adopter averred that the child was his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias,</span><span class="font0"> and in which&nbsp;judgment was at once given in his favour on the natural parent’s&nbsp;admission or tacit acquiescence. A similar method was followed&nbsp;in emancipation of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">filius,</span><span class="font0"> except that of course there was no </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cessio&nbsp;in jure,</span><span class="font0"> but instead thereof the parent manumitted immediately&nbsp;after the reconveyance to him. Neither in adoption nor emancipation, however, was remancipation to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> essential,&nbsp;though it was usual, and in the case of emancipation carried with&nbsp;it important rights of succession and tutory. For daughters and&nbsp;grandchildren the pontifical jurists by a casuistic interpretation&nbsp;of the said law held one mancipation to be in all cases enough to&nbsp;extinguish the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0">The nature of the relation between master and slave, like that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas,</span><span class="font0"> seems also to have been too notorious&nbsp;to require exposition in the Tables. We find recorded only two&nbsp;references to it, one dealing with the case of a slave who had a conditional testamentary gift of freedom </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(statu liber),</span><span class="font0"> the other with&nbsp;noxal surrender </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(noxae deditio).</span><span class="font0"> The provision about noxal surrender was not limited to a slave; it was apparently to the effect&nbsp;that, if a member of a man’s family </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(familiaris, i.e,a</span><span class="font0"> son of a&nbsp;daughter </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font0"> or a slave) committed a theft of, or did mischief&nbsp;to, property belonging to a third party, or*a domestic animal belonging to one man did harm to another, the father of the delinquent child, or the owner of the slave or animal, should either&nbsp;surrender him or it to the person injured or make reparation in&nbsp;damages. In course of time the surrender came to be regarded&nbsp;as a means of avoiding the primary obligation of making reparation.&nbsp;But comparative jurisprudence recognizes in the enactment of the&nbsp;Tables a modified survival of the ancient right of an injured party&nbsp;to have the delinquent </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">corpus</span><span class="font0">—man, beast or thing—given up to&nbsp;him to wreak his revenge upon it privately, the modification consisting in the alternative of reparation offered to the owner. This&nbsp;noxal surrender, failing reparation, had gone out of use in the case&nbsp;of daughters </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in potestate</span><span class="font0"> before the time of Gaius, and in the case&nbsp;of sons before that of Justinian; but it was still sanctioned so&nbsp;far as slaves and domestic animals were concerned even in that&nbsp;emperor’s legislation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Guardianship and the Introduction of the Order of Agnates.—</span><span class="font0">So long as Rome was patrician the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> apparently charged itself&nbsp;with the guardianship of a clansman’s orphan pupil&nbsp;children and his widow and unmarried daughters&nbsp;above pupillarity after his decease </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(tutela),</span><span class="font0"> as well&nbsp;as with that of male members of his family who were </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui&nbsp;juris,</span><span class="font0"> but above the age of pupillarity, when they chanced&nbsp;to be lunatic, imbecile, prodigal or helplessly infirm </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(cura,&nbsp;curatio),</span><span class="font0"> The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font0"> in council, in all probability, appointed&nbsp;one of its members to act as tutor or curator as the case might&nbsp;be, itself prescribed his duties, and itself called him to account&nbsp;for any failure in his administration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, as this gentile tutory could not be extended to the plebeians, among whom some law of guardianship was as&nbsp;much required as among their fellow-citizens of the higher&nbsp;order, the decemvirs found it expedient to devise a new one&nbsp;of universal application. The Tables contained no express&nbsp;authority for testamentary nomination of tutors to the widow</span></p>
