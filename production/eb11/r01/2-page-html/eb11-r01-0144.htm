<p><span class="font0">important alterations made in the execution of the picture. Raimondi’s engraving of the S. Cecilia of Bologna in design is very&nbsp;inferior to that of the actual painting. Several of Raphael’s most&nbsp;important compositions are known to us only by these early&nbsp;engravings, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> the Massacre of the Innocents (engraved by&nbsp;Raimondi), which is one of his finest works, both for skilful composition and for masterly drawing of the nude. Another magnificent design is the Judgment of Paris, containing a large number of&nbsp;figures; the nude figure of Minerva is a work of especial force&nbsp;and beauty. A standing figure of Lucretia@@<sup>1</sup> about to stab herself&nbsp;is also one of his most lovely figures. Many of Raphael’s studies for&nbsp;Marcantonio’s engravings still exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeology.—</span><span class="font0">As an antiquary Raphael deserves to take the highest rank. His report@@<sup>2</sup> to Leo X. in 1518 is an eloquent plea&nbsp;for the preservation of ancient buildings. In 1515 he had been&nbsp;appointed by Leo X. inspector of all excavations in Rome and&nbsp;within 10 miles round. His careful study of the antique, both&nbsp;statues and modes of decoration, is clearly shown in many of his&nbsp;frescoes, and especially in the graceful stucco reliefs and painted&nbsp;grotteschi, of which he and his pupils made such skilful use in&nbsp;the decorations of the Vatican loggie, the Villa Madama and&nbsp;elsewhere.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Raphael's Fame.—</span><span class="font1">Among all the painters of the world none has been so universally popular as Raphael, or has so steadily main-tained his pre-eminent reputation throughout the many changes&nbsp;in taste which have taken place in the last three and a half&nbsp;centuries. Apart from his combined merits as a draughtsman,&nbsp;colourist and master of graceful composition, he owes the constancy&nbsp;of admiration which has been felt for him partly to the wide range&nbsp;of his subjects, but still more to the wonderful varieties of his&nbsp;style. If the authorship of his paintings were unknown, who&nbsp;would guess that the Sposalizio of the Brcra, the Madonna del&nbsp;Baldacchino of the Pitti, and the Transfiguration could possibly&nbsp;be the work of one painter? In the seventeen or eighteen&nbsp;years which composed his short working life he passed through&nbsp;stages of development for which a century would not have&nbsp;seemed too long, while other painters lived through the same&nbsp;changeful time with but little alteration in their manner of&nbsp;work. Perugino, who outlived his wonderful pupil, completed&nbsp;in 1521 Raphael’s San Severo fresco in a style differing but little&nbsp;from his paintings executed in the previous century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In versatility of power Raphael (as a painter) remains almost without a rival; whether painting an altar-piece for a church,&nbsp;a large historical fresco, a portrait or decorative scenes from&nbsp;classical mythology, he seems to excel equally in each; and&nbsp;the widely different methods of painting in tempera, oil or&nbsp;fresco are employed by him with apparently equal facility.&nbsp;His range of scale is no less remarkable, varying from a miniature,&nbsp;finished like an illuminated MS., to colossal figures in fresco&nbsp;dashed in with inimitable breadth and vigour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His personal beauty, charm of manner and deep kindliness of heart endeared him to all who knew him.@@<sup>4</sup> His sincere modesty&nbsp;was not diminished by his admission as an equal by the princes&nbsp;of the church, the distinguished scholars and the world-famed&nbsp;men of every class who formed the courts of Julius II. and&nbsp;Leo X. In accordance with the spirit of the age he lived with&nbsp;considerable display and luxury, and was approached with the&nbsp;utmost deference by the ambassadors of foreign princes,&nbsp;whether their master desired a picture, or, as the duke of Ferrara&nbsp;did, sent to consult him on the best cure for smoky chimneys.&nbsp;To his pupils he was as a father, and they were all, as Vasari&nbsp;says, “vinti dalla sua cortesia”; they formed round him a&nbsp;sort of royal retinue, numbering about fifty youths, each&nbsp;talented in some branch of the arts.@@<sup>5</sup> Giuiio Romano and&nbsp;Gianfrancesco Penni, his two favourite pupils, lived with him&nbsp;in the Palazzo di Bramante, a house near St Peter’s, where he&nbsp;resided during the greater part of his life in Rome. This fine</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">palace, designed by Bramante, was destroyed in the 17th century at the same time as Raphael’s Palazzo dell’ Aquila.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is difficult to realize the grief and enthusiasm excited by the master’s death on Good Friday (April 6th) 1520, at the age&nbsp;of thirty-seven exactly, after an attack of fever which lasted&nbsp;only ten days. His body was laid out in state in his studio,&nbsp;by the side of the unfinished Transfiguration, and all Rome&nbsp;flocked to the place for a last sight of the “ divino pittore.” His&nbsp;property amounted to about £30,000; his drawings and MSS.&nbsp;he left to Giulio Romano and Gianfrancesco Penni; his newly&nbsp;bought land to Cardinal Bibbiena, the uncle of the lady to whom&nbsp;he had been betrothed; there were liberal bequests to his&nbsp;servants; and the rest was mostly divided among his relatives&nbsp;at Urbino. He desired to be buried in the Pantheon, under&nbsp;the noble dome which he and Bramante had dreamed of rivalling. His body is laid beside an altar, which he endowed with&nbsp;an annual chantry, and on the wall over it is a plain slab, with&nbsp;an inscription written by his friend Cardinal Bembo. Happily&nbsp;his grave has as yet escaped the disfigurement of a pretentious&nbsp;monument such as those erected to Michelangelo, Dante and&nbsp;other great Italians; it has not, however, remained undis-turbed: in 1833 it was opened and the bones examined.@@<sup>6</sup> In&nbsp;March 1883 a festival was held at Urbino, on the occasion of the&nbsp;4th centenary of his birth, and on this occasion many interesting&nbsp;articles on Raphael were published, especially one by Gey-müller, “ Le IV<sup>me</sup> centenaire de la naissance de Raphaël,”&nbsp;1483-1883, in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gaz. de Lausanne,</span><span class="font1"> March 1883.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reproductions of Raphael's Works.—</span><span class="font0">From the time of Raimondi downwards no painter’s works have been so frequently engraved.&nbsp;The Calcografia Camerale (now called Regia) of Rome possesses&nbsp;an enormous number of copper-plates of his pictures by a great&nbsp;many good (and bad) engravers of the 18th and 19th centuries.&nbsp;Electrotypes of the old coppers are still worked, and are published&nbsp;by the Stamperia at very moderate prices; in the catalogue Nos.&nbsp;736 to 894 are the works of Raphael, including several books of&nbsp;engravings containing whole sets, such as the Vatican loggie, &amp;c.&nbsp;A very complete collection of photographs from these and other&nbsp;engravings was published by Gutbier and Lübke, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rafael's Werke,&nbsp;sämmtliche Tafelbilder und Fresken</span><span class="font0"> (Dresden, 1881-82), in three large&nbsp;volumes, divided into classes,—pictures of the Madonna, frescoes,&nbsp;stanze of the Vatican, tapestry cartoons, &amp;c. The descriptive text&nbsp;and life of Raphael are by Lübke. The Malcolm, Oxford, British&nbsp;Museum, Lille, Louvre, Dresden and other collections of Raphael’s&nbsp;drawings have mostly been published in photographic facsimile,&nbsp;and an enormous number of illustrated monographs on single&nbsp;pictures exist. Braun’s autotypes of the stanze and Farnesina&nbsp;frescoes are especially good.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. H. M.)</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
