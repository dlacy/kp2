<p><span class="font0">saturated by being laid in powdered sulphur maintained for some hours at about i io<sup>6</sup> C. Sheets sulphured in this way can be made up&nbsp;into articles and joined together either by warming the parts to be&nbsp;united,, or.by means of indiarubber solution; after which the true&nbsp;vulcanization, or “ curing,” as it is termed, can be brought about&nbsp;in the usual way.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Another method of vulcanizing articles made from cut sheet rubber consists in exposing them to the action of chloride of&nbsp;sulphur. Either they are placed in a leaden cupboard into which&nbsp;the vapour is introduced, or they are dipped for a few seconds in a&nbsp;mixture of one part of chloride of sulphur and forty parts of carbon&nbsp;disulphide or purified light petroleum. Vulcanization takes place&nbsp;in this instance without the action of heat; but it is usual to subject&nbsp;the goods for a short time to a temperature of 40° C. after their&nbsp;removal from the solution, in order to drive off the liquid which has&nbsp;been absorbed, and to ensure a sufficient action of the chloride of&nbsp;sulphur. Treatment with a warm alkaline solution is afterwards&nbsp;advisable, in order to remove traces of hydrochloric acid generated&nbsp;during the process. Another very excellent method of vulcanizing&nbsp;cut sheet goods consists in placing them in a solution of the polysulphides of calcium at a temperature of 140° C. Rubber employed&nbsp;for the manufacture of cut sheets is often coloured by such pigments&nbsp;as vermilion, oxide of chromium, ultramarine, orpiment, antimony,&nbsp;lamp black, or oxide of zinc, incorporation being effected either by&nbsp;means of the masticator or by a pair of rollers heated internally&nbsp;by steam, and so geared as to move in contrary directions at unequal</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">speed (fig. 9). Most of the rubber now manufactured is not combined with sulphur when in the form of sheets, but is mechanically incorporated with about one-tenth of its weight of that substance&nbsp;by means of the mixing rollers—any required pigment or other&nbsp;matter, such as whiting or. barium sulphate, being added. The&nbsp;mixed rubber thus obtained is readily softened by heat, and can be&nbsp;very easily worked into any desired form or rolled into sheets by&nbsp;an apparatus known as the calendering machine. Vulcanization is&nbsp;then ensured by exposure for half an hour or more to a temperature&nbsp;of I35°-I5O° C., usually in closed iron vessels into which high-pressure steam is admitted (fig. 10). Tubes are generally made up&nbsp;around mandrels, and&nbsp;allowed throughout&nbsp;the curing to remain&nbsp;imbedded in pulverized French chalk,&nbsp;which affords a useful&nbsp;support for many&nbsp;articles . that tend to&nbsp;lose their shape during&nbsp;the process. Of late&nbsp;years a considerable&nbsp;amount of seamless&nbsp;tubing has been made,&nbsp;much in the.same way&nbsp;as lead piping, by&nbsp;forcing the mixed rubber through a die,&nbsp;and curing as above.&nbsp;The calendered sheets&nbsp;are generally cured&nbsp;between folds of wet&nbsp;cloth, the markings of&nbsp;which. . they retain;&nbsp;and hollow articles, such as playing balls or injection bottles,&nbsp;are vulcanized in iron or brass moulds, tinned inside and very&nbsp;slightly greased. Before it is put in, the article is roughly put&nbsp;together, and the expansion of the included air forces the rubber into&nbsp;contact with the internal surface of the mould, or a little carbonate&nbsp;of ammonia is enclosed. Belting intended for driving machinery&nbsp;is built up of canvas which has been thoroughly frictioned with the&nbsp;soft mixed rubber, and is cured by placing it in a kind of press kept&nbsp;by means of steam at a dry heat of about 140 <sup>0</sup> C. Packing for the&nbsp;stuffing boxes of steam engines is similarly prepared from strips of&nbsp;rubber and frictioned canvas, as also are the so-called insertion&nbsp;sheets, in which layers of rubber alternate with.canvas or even wire&nbsp;gauze. Indiarubber stereotypes are now extensively made use of as&nbsp;hand stamps, and attempts nave been made to introduce them for&nbsp;press and machine printing. A plaster cast of the type is, when dry,&nbsp;saturated with shellac varnish and redried. Rubber mixed in the&nbsp;usual way with about 10% of sulphur is now softened by heat,&nbsp;forced into the mould, and retained there by pressure during the&nbsp;operation of curing, which is usually effected in an iron box heated&nbsp;over a gas burner to 140° C.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ordinary macintosh or waterproof cloth is prepared by spreading on the textile fabric layer after layer of indiarubber paste&nbsp;or solution made with benzol or coal-naphtha. If cotton or linen&nbsp;is used, it is usual to incorporate sulphur with the paste, and to&nbsp;effect vulcanization by steam heat; but, when, silk or wool is employed, no sulphur is added to the paste, the»dried coating of rubber&nbsp;being merely brought into momentary contact with the mixture&nbsp;of chloride of sulphur and carbon disulphide already mentioned.&nbsp;Double texture goods are made by uniting the rubber surfaces of&nbsp;two pieces of the coated material. Air goods, such as cushions,&nbsp;beds, gas bags, and so forth, are made of textile fabrics which have&nbsp;been coated with mixed rubber either by the spreading process&nbsp;above described, or by means of heated rollers, the curing being then&nbsp;effected by steam heat. The manufacture of overshoes and fishing&nbsp;boots is an analogous process, only the canvas base is more thickly&nbsp;coated with a highly pigmented rubber of low quality. The articles&nbsp;are first fashioned by joining the soft material; they are then&nbsp;varnished, and afterwards cured in ovens heated to about 135° C.&nbsp;The fine vulcanized “ spread sheets ” are made by spreading layers&nbsp;of indiarubber solution, already charged with the requisite proportion of sulphur, on a textile base previously prepared with a&nbsp;mixture of paste, glue and treacle; Vulcanization is then effected&nbsp;by steam heat, and, the preparation on the cloth being softened by&nbsp;water, the sheet of rubber is readily removed. The required thickness of the spread sheet is very often secured by the rubber-faced&nbsp;surfaces of two cloths being united before curing. The threads&nbsp;used in making elastic webbing are usually cut from spread sheets.&nbsp;The manufacture of. springs, valves and washers does not require&nbsp;any very special notice, these articles being generally fashioned out&nbsp;of mixed rubber, and vulcanized either in moulds or in powdered&nbsp;French chalk. Rollers are made to adhere to their metal spindles&nbsp;by the intervention of a layer of ebonite, and after vulcanization&nbsp;they are turned. In order to make spongy or porous rubber, some&nbsp;material is incorporated which will give off gas or vapour at the&nbsp;vulcanizing temperature,—such as carbonate of ammonia, crystallized alum, and finely ground damp sawdust. Uncombincd sulphur&nbsp;is injurious, and often leads to the decay of vulcanized goods, but&nbsp;an excess of sulphur is generally required in order to ensure perfect&nbsp;vulcanization. Sometimes the excess is partially removed by&nbsp;boiling the finished goods with a solution of caustic soda, or some&nbsp;other solvent of sulphur. In other cases the injurious effects of&nbsp;free sulphur are obviated by using instead of it a metallic sulphide,—&nbsp;generally the orange sulphide of antimony; but, for the best results,'&nbsp;it. is necessary that this should contain from 20 to 30 % of uncombined sulphur.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It will thus be seen that for nearly all practical purposes, including tires, vulcanized rubber mixed with mineral matter is employed.&nbsp;Such articles contain varying proportions of rubber (12-60%),&nbsp;about 1-2 % of. combined sulphur, and from 25-70 % of mineral&nbsp;matter. Vulcanized rubber is also now largely used as an electrical&nbsp;insulator for the construction of cables, &amp;c.<sub>(</sub> instead of gutta-percha.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the vulcanization of rubber is carried too far, from the presence of a very large proportion of sulphur and an unduly long&nbsp;action of heat, the caoutchouc becomes hard., horn-like, ana often&nbsp;black. Rubber hardened by over-vulcanization is largely manufactured under the name of ebonite or vulcanite. It is usually&nbsp;made by incorporating about 40 % of sulphur with purified Borneo&nbsp;rubber by means of the usual mixing rollers, shaping the required&nbsp;articles out of the mass thus obtained, and heating for six, eight or&nbsp;ten hours to from 135® to 150°. Ebonite takes a fine polish, and is&nbsp;valuable to the electrician on account of its insulating properties,&nbsp;and to the chemist and photographer because vessels made of it are&nbsp;unaffected by most chemical reagents. A kind of vulcanite which&nbsp;contains a large proportion of vermilion or other mineral pigment&nbsp;is used, under the name of dental rubber, for making artificial gums&nbsp;and supports for artificial teeth.</span></p>
