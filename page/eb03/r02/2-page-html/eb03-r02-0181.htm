<p><span class="font0">ready adulation, ſet up the ſtatues of the favourite be-ſide thoſe of Tiberius, and ſeemed eager to pay him ſimilar honours. It is not well known whether he was&nbsp;the adviſer of all the cruelties that enſued ſoon after ;&nbsp;but certain it is, that, from the beginning of his&nbsp;miniſtry, Tiberius ſeemed to become more fatally ſu-ſpicious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was ſrom ſuch humble beginnings that this miniſter even ventured to aſpire at the throne, and was reſolved to make the emperor’s fooliſh conſidence one&nbsp;of the firſt ſteps to his ruin. However, he conſidered&nbsp;that cutting off Tiberius alone would rather retard&nbsp;than promote his deſigns while his ſon Druſus and&nbsp;the children of Germanicus were yet remaining. He&nbsp;therefore began by corrupting Livia, the wiſe of Druſus ; whom, after having debauched her, he prevailed&nbsp;upon to poiſon her huſhand. This was effected by means&nbsp;of a flow poifon (as we are told), which gave his&nbsp;death the appearance of a caſual diſtemper. Tiberius,&nbsp;in the mean time, either naturally phlegmatic, or at&nbsp;leaſt not much regarding his ſon, bore his death with&nbsp;great tranquillity. He was even heard to jell upon the&nbsp;occaſion; for when the ambaſſadors from Troy came&nbsp;ſomewhat late with their compliments of condolence, he&nbsp;anſwered their pretended diſtreſſes, by condoling with&nbsp;them alſo upon the loſs of Hector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sejanus having ſucceeded in this, was reſolved to make his next attempt upon the children of Germanicus, who were undoubted ſucceffors to the empire.&nbsp;However, be was fruſtrated in his deſigns, both with&nbsp;regard to the fidelity of their governors, and the chaſ-tity of Agrippina their mother. Whereupon he reſolved upon changing his aims, and removing Tiberius&nbsp;out of the city ; by which means he expected more&nbsp;frequent opportunities of putting his deſigns into execution. He therefore uſed all his addreſs to perſuade&nbsp;Tiberius to retire to ſome agreeable retreat, remote&nbsp;from Rome. By this he expected many advantages,&nbsp;ſince there could be no acceſs to the emperor but by&nbsp;him. Thus all letters being conveyed to the prince by&nbsp;ſoldiers at his own devotion, they would paſs through&nbsp;his hands ; by which means he muſt in time become the&nbsp;ſole governor of the empire, and at laſt be in a capacity&nbsp;of removing all obſtacles to his ambition. He now&nbsp;therefore began to inſinuate to Tiberius the great and&nbsp;numerous inconveniences of the city, the fatigues of&nbsp;attending the ſenate, and the ſeditious temper of the&nbsp;inferior citizens of Rome. Tiberius, either prevailed&nbsp;upon by his perſuaſions, or purſuing the natural turn&nbsp;of his temper, which led to indolence and debauchery,&nbsp;in the twelfth year of his reign left Rome, and went&nbsp;into Campania, under pretence of dedicating temples to&nbsp;Jupiter and Auguſtus. After this, though he removed&nbsp;to ſeveral places, he never returned to Rome ; but ſpent&nbsp;the greateſt part of his time in the iſland of Caprea, a&nbsp;place which was rendered as infamous by his pleaſures&nbsp;as deteſtable by bis cruelties, which were ſhoeking to&nbsp;human nature. Buried in this retreat, he gave himſelf up to his pleaſures, quite regardleſs of the miſeries&nbsp;of his ſubjects. Thus an inſurrection of the Jews, upon&nbsp;placing his ſtatue in Jeruſalem, under the government&nbsp;of Pontius Pilate, gave him no ſort of uneaſineſs. The&nbsp;falling of an amphitheatre at Fidenæ, in which ço,ooo&nbsp;perſons were either killed or wounded, no way affected&nbsp;his repoſe. He was only employed in ſtudying how</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">to vary his odious pleaſures, and forcing his feeble frame, ſhattered by age and former debaucheries, into&nbsp;the enjoyment of them. Nothing can preſent a more&nbsp;horrid picture than the retreat of this impure old man<sub>r&nbsp;</sub>attended by all the miniſters of his perverted appetites.&nbsp;He was at this time 67 years old ; his perſon was moſt&nbsp;diſpleaſing ; and ſome ſay the diſagreeableneſs of it, in&nbsp;a great meaſure, drove him into retirement. He. was&nbsp;quite bald before ; his face was all broke out into ulcers, and covered over with plaſters ; his body was bowed&nbsp;forward, while its extreme height and leanneſs increaſed&nbsp;its deformity. With ſuch a perſon, and a mind ſtill&nbsp;more hideous, being gloomy, ſuſpicious, and cruel, he&nbsp;ſat down with a view rather of forcing his appetites&nbsp;than ſatisfying them. He ſpent whole nights in debaucheries at the table ; and he appointed Pomponius&nbsp;Flaccus and Lucius Piſo to the firſt poſts of the empire, for no other merit than that of having ſat up with&nbsp;him two days and two nights without interruption.&nbsp;Theſe he called his friends of all hours. He made one&nbsp;Novelius Torgnatus a praetor for being able to drink off&nbsp;five bottles of wine at a draught. His luxuries of another kind were ſtill more deteſtable, and ſeemed to increaſe with his drunkenneſs and gluttony. He made the&nbsp;moſt eminent women of Rome ſubſervient to his lulls ;&nbsp;and all his inventions only ſeemed calculated how to&nbsp;make his vices more extravagant and abominable. Tſe&nbsp;numberleſs obſcene medals dug up in that iſiand at&nbsp;this day bear witneſs at once to his ſhame, and the&nbsp;veracity of the hiſtorians who have deſcribed his debaucheries. In ſhort, in this retreat, which was ſurrounded with rocks on every ſide, he quite gave up the&nbsp;buſineſs of the empire ; or, if he was ever .active, it&nbsp;was only to do miſchief. But, ſrom the time of his&nbsp;retreat, he became more cruel, and Sejanus always&nbsp;endeavoured to increaſe his diſtruſts. Secret ſpies and&nbsp;informers were placed in all parts of the city, who&nbsp;converted the moſt harmleſs actions into ſubjects of&nbsp;offence. If any perſon of merit teſtiſied any concern&nbsp;for the glory of the empire, it was immediately con-ſtrued into a deſign to obtain it. If another ſpoke&nbsp;with regret of former liberty, he was ſuppofed to aim&nbsp;at re-eſtabliſhing the commonwealth. Every action&nbsp;became liable to forced interpretations ; joy expreſſed&nbsp;an hope of the prince’s death ; melancholy, an envying of his proſperity. Sejanus found his ai n every&nbsp;day ſucceeding ; the wretched emperor’s terrors were&nbsp;an inſtrument that he wrought upon at his pleaſure,&nbsp;and by which he levelled every obſtacle to his deſigns.&nbsp;But the chief objects of his jealouſy were the children&nbsp;of Germanicus, whom he reſolved to put out of the way.&nbsp;He therefore continued to render them obnoxious to&nbsp;the emperor, to alarm him with falſe reports of their&nbsp;ambition, and to terrify them with alarms of his intended cruelty. By theſe means, he ſo contrived to&nbsp;widen the breach, that he actually produced on both&nbsp;ſides thoſe diſpoſitions which he pretended to obviate ;&nbsp;till at length, the two princes Nero and Druſus were&nbsp;declared enemies to the ſtate, and afterwards ſtarved&nbsp;to death in priſon ; while Agrippina their mother was&nbsp;ſent into baniſhment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In this manner Sejanus proceeded, removing all who ſtood between him and the empire, and every day increaſing in conſidence with Tiberius, and power with&nbsp;the ſenate. The number of his ſtatues exceeded even</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
