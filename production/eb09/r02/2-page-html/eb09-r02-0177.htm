<p><span class="font1">1766 he succeeded his former chief as first lord of the treasury and prime minister. Then followed many years&nbsp;of fruitless opposition to the king’s personal authority as&nbsp;exhibited through his ministers, but at last, on 27th March&nbsp;1782, Lord Rockingham again became prime minister&nbsp;with Fox and Shelburne as secretaries of state. This&nbsp;time he enjoyed office for but a few weeks, for he died&nbsp;on 1st July 1782. A few words from his epitaph by&nbsp;Burke deserve quotation as giving the reason of the predominance of such an ordinary man as Lord Rockingham&nbsp;over a party abounding in men of great abilities : “ A man&nbsp;worthy to be held in esteem, because he did not live for&nbsp;himself. . . . He far exceeded all other statesmen in the&nbsp;art of drawing together, without the seduction of self-interest, the concurrence and co-operation of various dispositions and abilities of men, whom he assimilated to his&nbsp;character and associated in his labours.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROCK ISLAND, a city of the United States, the capital of Rock Island county, Illinois, is situated opposite&nbsp;Davenport on the left bank of the Mississippi, about 3&nbsp;miles above the mouth of the Rock river and at the foot&nbsp;of the Upper Rapids, which extend for about 16 miles.&nbsp;Distant by rail 181 miles west of Chicago and 247 miles&nbsp;north of St Louis, Rock Island is one of the great centres&nbsp;of railroad and river traffic. With Davenport (in Iowa)&nbsp;it is connected by a two-story road and railway bridge&nbsp;constructed by the Government in 1870. Among the&nbsp;public buildings are a large public library and St Augustana College, founded by the Swedish Lutherans. Glassworks, a plough factory, a distillery, flour-mills, and a&nbsp;stove factory are the principal industrial establishments.&nbsp;The city, however, is best known from the great national&nbsp;arsenal situated on the island from which it derives its&nbsp;name. This island is a ridge of limestone rock about 3&nbsp;miles long and with an area of 960 acres. As the site of&nbsp;Fort Armstrong it became known in the Black Hawk&nbsp;War ; the prison was used for the detention of Confederate&nbsp;prisoners during the Civil War ; and since that date the&nbsp;Government has constructed the present extensive works,&nbsp;intended to be the central United States armoury. There&nbsp;are ten vast stone workshops, each with a stone house in&nbsp;the rear, as well as officers’ quarters, offices, &amp;c. The&nbsp;population of Rock Island city was 5130 in 1860, 7890&nbsp;in 1870, and 11,659 in 1880. Its charter dates from 1849.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCKLAND, a city and seaport of the United States, county town of Knox county, Maine, is situated 60 miles&nbsp;by rail east-north-east of Portland on Owl’s Head Bay, an&nbsp;inlet of Ponobscot Bay. It was incorporated in 1854, has&nbsp;an area of 7000 acres and a sea frontage of about 4∣ miles,&nbsp;and numbered 7599 inhabitants in 1880 (in 1870 7074).&nbsp;Lime-burning is the staple trade (1,000,000 barrels per&nbsp;annum). The adjacent islands—Dix Island, Hurricane&nbsp;Island, &amp;c.—are known by their granite quarries. Water&nbsp;for the city is obtained from Lake Chickawaukie.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROCROI, a town of France, the chef-lieu of an arrondissement in the department of Ardennes, lies 15 miles in a straight line north-north-west of Mézières and within 2&nbsp;miles of the Belgian frontier, at a height of 1083 feet&nbsp;above the sea. As a fortified place it commands the&nbsp;Ardennes plateau between the valley of the Meuse and&nbsp;the headwaters of the Oise. The present fortifications&nbsp;were constructed by Vauban. In 1881 the population&nbsp;was 1649 (commune 2977).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This spot, originally called Croix-de-Rau or Rau Croix, was fortified in the 16th century and besieged by the imperialists in&nbsp;1555. Invested by the Spaniards in 1643, it was relieved by the&nbsp;young duke of Enghien (afterwards the Great Condé) after a brilliant&nbsp;victory. Captured in 1658 by the same duke, then in tlχe Spanish&nbsp;service, it was not restored to France till the treaty of the Pyrenees&nbsp;in 1659. In 1815 Rocroi was besieged for a month hy the allies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RODBERTUS, Karl Johann (1805-1875), by some considered to be the founder of scientific socialism, was&nbsp;born at Greifswald on 12th August 1805, his father being&nbsp;a professor at the university there. He studied law at&nbsp;Göttingen and Berlin, thereafter engaging in various legal&nbsp;occupations ; and, after travelling for some time, he bought&nbsp;the estate of Jagetzow in Pomerania, whence his name of&nbsp;Rodbertus-Jagetzow. In 1836 he settled on this estate,&nbsp;and henceforward devoted his life chiefly to economic and&nbsp;other learned studies, taking also some interest in local&nbsp;and provincial affairs. After the revolution of March 1848&nbsp;Rodbertus was elected member of the Prussian national&nbsp;assembly, in which body he belonged to the left centre ;&nbsp;and for fourteen days he filled the post of minister of&nbsp;public worship and education. He sat for Berlin in the&nbsp;second chamber of 1849, and moved the adoption of the&nbsp;Frankfort imperial constitution, which was carried. When&nbsp;the system of dividing the Prussian electorate into three&nbsp;classes was adopted, Rodbertus recommended abstention&nbsp;from voting. His only subsequent appearance in public&nbsp;life was his candidature for the first North German diet,&nbsp;in which he was defeated. His correspondence with&nbsp;Lassalle was an interesting feature of his life. At one&nbsp;time Rodbertus had some intention of forming a “ social&nbsp;party ” with the help of the conservative socialist Rudolf&nbsp;Meyer and of Hasencleve⅛, a prominent follower of Lassalle ;&nbsp;but no progress was made in this. Rodbertus was neither&nbsp;disposed nor qualified to be an agitator, being a man of a&nbsp;quiet and critical temperament, who believed that society&nbsp;could not be improved by violent changes, but by a long&nbsp;and gradual course of development. He warned the working men of Germany against connecting themselves with&nbsp;any political party, enjoining them to be a “ social party ”&nbsp;pure and simple. He died on 8th December 1875.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The general position of Rodbertus was “social, monarchical, and national.” With his entire soul he held the purely economic part&nbsp;of the creed of the German social-democratic party, but he did not&nbsp;agree with their methods, and had no liking for the productive&nbsp;associations with state help of Lassalle. He regarded a socialistic&nbsp;republic as a possible thing, but he cordially accepted the monarchic&nbsp;institution in his own country and hoped that a German emperor&nbsp;might undertake the rôle of a social emperor. He was also a true&nbsp;patriot and was proud and hopeful of the career that lay before the&nbsp;regenerated empire of Germany. The basis of the economic teaching of Rodbertus is the principle laid down by Adam Smith and&nbsp;Ricardo and insisted on by all the later socialists, that labour is the&nbsp;source and measure of value. In connexion with this he developed&nbsp;the position that rent, profit, and wages are all parts of a national&nbsp;income produced by the united organic labour of the workers of the&nbsp;community. Consequently there can be no talk of the wages of&nbsp;labour being paid out of capital ; wages is only that part of the&nbsp;national income which is received by the workmen, of a national&nbsp;income which they have themselves entirely produced. The&nbsp;wages fund theory is thus summarily disposed of. But the most&nbsp;important result of the theory is his position that the possession&nbsp;of land and capital enables the landholders and capitalists to compel&nbsp;the workmen to divide the product of their labour with those nonworking classes, and in such a proportion that the workers only&nbsp;obtain as much as can support them in life. Thus the iron law of&nbsp;wages is established. Hence also Rodbertus deduces his theory of&nbsp;commercial crises and of pauperism, and in the following way. In&nbsp;spite of the increasing productivity of labour, the workers obtain in&nbsp;general only sufficient to support their class, and therefore a smaller&nbsp;relative share of the national income. But the producers form also&nbsp;the large mass of consumers, and, with the decline of their relative&nbsp;share in the national income, must decline the relative purchasing&nbsp;power of this large class of the people. The growing production&nbsp;is not met by a correspondingly growing consumption ; expansion&nbsp;is succeeded by contraction of production, by a scarcity of employment, and a further decline in purchasing power on the part of the&nbsp;workers. Thus we have a commercial crisis bringing with it pauperism as a necessary result. In the meantime the purchasing&nbsp;power of the non-producing capitalists and landholders continues&nbsp;relatively to increase ; but, as they have already had enough to buy</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
