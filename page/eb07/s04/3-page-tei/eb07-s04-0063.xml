The changes recommended and finally adopted by the Cortes were, 1st, that the part of the constitution which contain ed mere regulations and forms, and regarded organic bodies and laws, should be entirely suppressed : 2dly, that in stead of the Cortes continuing to form, as they did under the constitution of 1812, only one body, they should now consist of two bodies, differing from each other in the personal qualification of their members, &amp;c. but neither to be hereditary nor privileged : 3dly, that the crown should have an absolute veto in the enactment of laws, and should like wise have the power of convoking, proroguing, and dis solving the Cortes ; but in the latter case to be under the obligation of assembling others within a given time : 4thly, that the election of members of the Cortes should be direct, and not indirect, as established by the constitution of 1812.</p><p>While Spain was thus undergoing the most momentous political changes, the very existence of the queen’s government was threatened by the Carlists, who were making alarming progress in the very centre of the kingdom. During the early part of the year the Christines attackcd the position of the Carlists at Arlavan, but with so little success that they were compelled to make a retrograde movement. However, early in May, the British legion, under General Evans, gallantly carried the Carliιst lines be fore St Sebastian ; but unfortunately this victory, like many others gained, was productive of no important result, chiefly through the sloth and inactivity of the Spanish generals. The circumstance which created the great alarm to which allusion has been made, was the march of a large body of Carlists under Gomez through the very heart of Spain. This chief penetrated from province to province, to the centre of Andalusia, laying the country under heavy contribution, and carrying off loads of booty from every place which he visited. The audacity of this enterprise seems for a time to have paralysed the royalists. Consternation spread over Spain from Madrid to Gibraltar. Gomez at tacked and carried several towns, and some bodies of troops who attempted to arrest his progress were totally destroyed. No less than three distinguished Spanish generals, each with a large army, were despatched to cut him oft’; but all their efforts to entrap him and his daring band proved fruit less. He was repeatedly surrounded, and apparently on the eve of being taken, but always succeeded i n effecting his escape. At length, however, he was hemmed in to the seacoast at San Roque, and his destruction seemed inevi table ; but, by a daring and masterly movement, he broke through the line which encompassed him, and secured his retreat to the strongholds of the north.</p><p>Towards the close of 1836, the town of Bilboa was again invested by the Carlists, to whom it was an object of great importance, as being a city of sufficient consideration to give dignity to the court of Carlos, and an appearance of permanence to his establishment. It was, besides, the capital of Biscay, and inseparably connected, in the eyes of the Basques, with their <hi rend="italic">fueros</hi> and local parliament. The siege was carried on with an ardour corresponding with the importance attached to the place. The defence was equally spirited and heroic. During the sixty days which the in vestment lasted, the fortitude of the besieged was put to the severest test, not only by the long-continued fire of the Carlists, by their repeated attacks, and by their mining operations, but by want of proper food and by sickness. At length General Espartero succeeded in compelling the Carlists to retire with the loss of all their guns and <hi rend="italic">matériel </hi>for the siege, and Bilboa was relieved. The intelligence was received at Madrid with unbounded enthusiasm, and honours and rewards were heaped upon the defenders, and those who had so opportunely relieved them. The Chris</p><p>tinos, however, as usual, neglected to follow up the success, allowing the Carlists to remain unmolested in the neighbourhood. Near St Sebastian they mustered very strong during the early part of 1837, and here they were attacked by the Anglo-Christinos under General Evans, and driven back with some loss ; but receiving a great accession of strength, the Carlists in their turn compelled the royalists to retreat with at least equal loss. The affair of Hernani would have been much more disastrous, but for the steady bravery of a small body of British marines, who checked the advance of the Carlists, and retired to St Sebastian in good order. In a subsequent attack on Irun and Fuent arahia, General Evans was completely successful ; but it seems perfectly clear that this officer was never cordially supported by the Spanish commanders. The defeat before Hernani would never have taken place had Espartero and Sarsfield supported him according to the concerted plan. The time for which the British legion volunteered its ser vices expired in the month of May, and shortly afterwards it disbanded, nearly the whole returning to England in the most destitute condition. Meanwhile Don Carlos had follow ed the example of Gomez, by marching an army through the central parts of the kingdom. Our limits will not permit us to follow him in this daring but useless expedition. One body of Carlists advanced within a few leagues of Madrid, and all was consternation in the capital. But the Christino generals concentrating their forces, compelled the main body of the Carlist army to retire from the provinces into which it had made so fierce an irruption. Disunion also began to show itself in the camp of Don Carlos, so that, disappointed and disheartened, he retreated to his old fastness beyond the Ebro, accompanied however by a large convoy of booty. Besides these military operations, prosecuted on a large scale, there was a system of desultory warfare maintained all over the country, more destructive in its effects upon the inhabitants than the regular operations of an army. Brigandage, never viewed with much horror in Spain, had now become as common as a lawful trade. Remorseless cruelty characterized the proceedings of all parties ; and civil life, except in the large towns, seemed for the time suspended.</p><p>The civil and parliamentary history of Spain for 1837 presents little that is of any importance. The new constitution formed a fruitful theme of discussion in the Cortes. After undergoing the alterations already mentioned, and some others of less moment, it was solemnly ratified by the queen-regent in the Cortes, and proclaimed to the nation. It is worthy of being noticed, that an attempt to introduce toleration in religious matters, by an amendment to the article which establishes the Catholic faith, met with the strongest opposition. This striking fact shows how deeply rooted the old Spanish bigotry remains in the national mind. During the year, bills were passed for the suppression of religious houses, and the abolition of the payment of tithes, the maintenance of the clergy being left to the government. Several judicious ecclesiastical reforms were projected; and among other important measures passed by the Cortes, was the abolition of the local parliaments in the Basque provin ces. Ministerial changes repeatedly took place during the year, but into these we shall not enter.</p><p>The military operations of the Carlists in 1838 were Iess successful and less enterprising than they had been during the two previous years. Cabrera, indeed, a general w ho had frequently signalized his talents for war, had firmly established himself in Aragon and Valencia, and the bands of partisans allowed no respite to the distracted provinces ; but we have to record none of those daring and brilliant flying expeditions which more than once traversed Spain in all directions with such celerity and success as to command the attention of Europe. Something of this kind was indeed attempted by Basilio Garcia, and by Tallada, but</p></body></text></TEI>
