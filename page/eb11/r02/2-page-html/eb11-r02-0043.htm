<p><span class="font1">difficulty attends the classification of one than of the other.” Indeed Vosmaer points out in his Life of Rembrandt that there is a marked parallelism between Rembrandt’s painted and etched work,&nbsp;his early work in both cases being timid and tentative, while he&nbsp;gradually gains strength and character both with the brush and the&nbsp;graver’s tools.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">U Œuvre complet de Rembrandt</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1885), Eugène Dutuit rejects the classification of </span><span class="font0">C. </span><span class="font1">Blanc as dubious and unwarranted,&nbsp;dismisses the chronological arrangement proposed by Vosmaer and&nbsp;adopted by Seymour Haden and Middleton as open to discussion&nbsp;and lacking in possibility of proof, and reverts to the order established by Gersaint, ranging his materials under twelve heads:&nbsp;Portraits (real and supposed), Old Testament and New Testament&nbsp;subjects, histories, landscapes, &amp;c. Sir Seymour Haden originated&nbsp;the theory that many of the etchings ascribed to Rembrandt up to&nbsp;1640 were the work of his pupils, and seems to make out his case,&nbsp;though it may be carried too far. He argues (in his monograph on&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Etched Work of Rembrandt,</span><span class="font1"> 1877) that Rembrandt’s real work in&nbsp;etching began after Saskia’s death, when he assumes that Rembrandt&nbsp;betook himself to Elsbroek, the country house of his “ powerful&nbsp;friend ” Jan Six. But it must be remembered that the future&nbsp;burgomaster was then but a student of twenty-four, a member of.a&nbsp;great family it is true, but unmarried and taking.as yet no share in&nbsp;public life. That Rembrandt was a frequent visitor at Elsbroek,&nbsp;and that the “ Three Trees ” and other etchings may have been produced there, may be admitted without requiring us to believe that&nbsp;he had left Amsterdam as his place of abode. The great period of&nbsp;his etching lies between 1639 and 1661, after which the old painter&nbsp;seems to nave renounced the needle. In these twenty years were&nbsp;produced his greatest works in portraiture, landscape and Bible&nbsp;story. They bear the impress of the genius of the man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REMEDIOS, or San Jüan de Los Remedios, town of Santa Clara province, Cuba, in the municipality of San Juan de Los&nbsp;Remedios. Pop. of the town (1907), 6988; of the municipality, 21,573. The town is served by a branch of the Cuban&nbsp;Central railway, extending from Caibarien to Camajuani, where&nbsp;it connects with the main line. The site is low and flat, and&nbsp;unhealthily wet in the rainy season. The port of Remedios&nbsp;is Caibarién (pop. in 1907, 8333), on the N. coast, about 5 m. E.&nbsp;Both are in the sugar country, and sugar is the base of their&nbsp;economic interests. The first settlement on the site of the&nbsp;present town was made in 1515-16, and in 1545 Remedios was&nbsp;created a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">villa</span><span class="font0"> with an ayuntamiento (council).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REMEMBRANCER, the name originally of certain subordinate officers of the English Exchequer. The office itself is of great&nbsp;antiquity, the holder having been termed remembrancer,&nbsp;memorator, rememorator, registrar, keeper of the register,&nbsp;despatcher of business (Maddox, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of lhe Exchequer).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">There were at one time three clerks of the remembrance, styled&nbsp;king’s remembrancer, lord treasurer’s remembrancer and remembrancer of first-fruits. The latter two offices have become&nbsp;extinct, that of remembrancer of first-fruits by the diversion&nbsp;of the fund (Queen Anne’s Bounty Act 1838), and that of lord&nbsp;treasurer’s remembrancer on being merged in the office of king’s&nbsp;remembrancer (1833). By the Queen’s Remembrancer Act&nbsp;1859 the office ceased to exist separately, and the queen’s&nbsp;remembrancer was required to be a master of the court of&nbsp;exchequer. The Judicature Act 1873, s. 77, attached the office&nbsp;to the Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court of Judicature&nbsp;(Officers) Act 1879 transferred it to the central office of the&nbsp;Supreme Court. By s. 8 the king’s remembrancer is a master&nbsp;of the Supreme Court, and the office is usually filled by the&nbsp;senior master. The king’s remembrancer department of the&nbsp;central office is now amalgamated with the judgments and&nbsp;married women’s acknowledgments department. The king’s&nbsp;remembrancer still assists at certain ceremonial functions—&nbsp;relics of the former importance of the office—such as the nomination of sheriffs, the swearing-in of the lord mayor of London,&nbsp;the trial of the pyx and the acknowledgments of homage for&nbsp;crown lands. Other duties are set out in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Second Report of&nbsp;lhe Legal Departments Commission,</span><span class="font0"> 1874.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Remembrancer ” is also the title of an official of the corporation of the city of London, whose principal duty is to represent that body before parliamentary committees and at&nbsp;council and treasury boards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REMIGIUS, ST </span><span class="font0">(c. 437~533), bishop of Reims and the friend of Clovis, whom he converted to Christianity. According to&nbsp;Gregory of Tours, 3000 Franks were baptized with Clovis by&nbsp;Remigius on Christmas Day, 496, after the defeat of the Ala-manni. With the growing power of the papacy a good many&nbsp;fictions grew up around his name, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font0"> that he anointed Clovis&nbsp;with oil from the sacred ampulla, and that Pope Hormisdas had&nbsp;recognized him as primate of France. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Commentary on the&nbsp;Pauline Epistles</span><span class="font0"> (ed. Villalpandus, 1699) is not his work, but that&nbsp;of Remigius of Auxerre.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REMINGTON, FREDERICK (1861-1909), American artist, was born at Canton, New York, on the 4th of October r86r.&nbsp;He was a pupil of the Yale Art School, and of the Art Students’·&nbsp;League, New York, and became known as an illustrator,&nbsp;painter and sculptor. Having spent much time in the West,&nbsp;whither he went for his health, and having been with the&nbsp;United States troops in actual warfare, he made a specialty of&nbsp;rendering the North American Indian and the United States&nbsp;soldier as seen on the western plains. In the Spanish-American&nbsp;War he was with the army under General Shafter as war correspondent. He died on the 26th of December 1909, near Ridgefield, Connecticut.

Some of the houses of the canonesses dating&nbsp;from the 17th and 18th centuries also remain. Remiremont&nbsp;is the seat of a sub-prefect and has a tribunal of first instance,&nbsp;a communal college, a board of trade-arbitration and a chamber&nbsp;of arts and manufactures.
