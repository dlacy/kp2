In conſequence of this, that king met him on a ſpacious plain, unarmed, and only attended with a vaſt concourſe of his nobles. This was what Caracalla deſired. Regardleſs of his promiſe, or the law of nations, he inſtantly ſurrounded him with armed troops, let in wild beaſts among his attendants, and made a moſt terrible ſlaughter among them; Artabanus himſelſ eſcaping with the utmoſt difficulty. For this vile treachery he obtained ſrom the ſenate the ſurname of <hi rend="italic">Parthicus.</hi></p><p>Upon his return towards Rome, it would ſeem as if his vices were inexhauſtible; ſor having been guilty of parricide, he now reſolved to marry the mother of Geta whom he had ſlain. It happened that one day ſeeing her drop her veil, which diſcloſed her naked boſom, which was extremely beautiful, he told her, that he would poſſeſs thoſe charms he beheld, if it were lawful. To this unnatural requeſt ſhe heſitated not to anſwer, that he might enjoy all things who poſſeſſed all. Whereupon, ſetting aſide all duty and reſpect for his deceaſed ſather, he celebrated his nuptials with her in public, to tally diſregarding the cenſures and the ſarcaſms of mankind.</p><p>However, though he diſregarded ſhame, he was not inſenſible to fear. He was ever uneaſy in the conſci-ouſneſs of being univerſally hated; and was continually conſulting aſtrologers concerning what death he ſhould die. Among others, he ſent one of his confidants, named <hi rend="italic">Maternianus,</hi>  with orders to conſult all the aſtrolo-gers in the city concerning his end. Maternianus conſidered this as a proper time to get rid of Macrinus, the emperor’s principal commander in Meſopotamia; a man who was daily ſupplanting him in his maſter’s favour. He therefore informed him by letter, as if from the aſtrologers, that Macrinus had a deſign againſt his liſe; and they conſequently adviſed him to put the conſpirator to death. This letter was ſent ſealed, and made up, amongſt many others, to be conveyed with the greater ſecrecy, and delivered to the emperor as he was preparing for a chariot race. However, as it never was his cuſtom to interrupt his pleaſures for his buſineſs, he gave the packet to Macrinus to read over, and to inform him of the contents when more at leiſure. In peruſing theſe letters, when Macrinus came to that which regarded himſelf, he was unable to contain his ſurpriſe and terror. His firſt care was, to reſerve the fetter in queſtion to himſelf, and to acquaint the emperor only with the ſubſtance of the reſt. He then ſet about the moſt probable means of compaſſing his death, by which alone he could expect any ſafety. At length he determined to apply to one Martialis, a man ofgreat ſtrength, and a centurion of the guards, who hated the emperor from various motives; particularly for the death of a brother, whom Caracalla had ordered to be ſlain. Him therefore Macrinus exhorted to revenge his brother’s death, by killing the tyrant, which he might eaſily effect, as being always ſo near his perſon Martialis readily undertook the dangerous taſk; being willing to meet death himſelf, ſo he might obtain his deſire of ſeeing the tyrant expire before him. Accordingly, as the emperor was riding out one day near a little city called <hi rend="italic">Carra,</hi>  he happened to withdraw himſelf privately, upon a natural occaſion, with only one page to hold his horſe. This was the opportunity Martialis had ſo long and ardently deſired; wherefore running to him as if he had been called, he ſtabbed the emperor in the back, ſo that he died immediately. Martialis unconcernedly returned to his troop; but retiring by inſenſible degrees, he endeavoured to ſecure himſelf by flight. But his companions ſoon miſſing him, and the page giving information of what had been done, he was purſued by the German horſe and cut in pieces.</p><p>During the reign of this execrable tyrant, which continued ſix years, the empire was every day declining; the ſoldiers were entirely maſters of every election; and as there were various armies in different parts, ſo there were as many intereſts all oppoſite to each other. Caracalla, by ſatisfying their moſt unreaſonable appetites, deſtroyed all diſcipline among them, and all ſubordination in the ſtate.</p><p>The ſoldiers, now without an emperor, after a ſuſpenſe of two days, fixed upon Macrinus, who took all poſſible methods to conceal his being privy to Caracalla’s murder. The ſenate confirmed their choice ſhortly after; and likewiſe that of his ſon Diadumenus, whom he took as a partner in the empire. Macrinus was 53 years old when he entered upon the government of the empire. He was of obſcure parentage; ſome ſay by birth a Moor, who by the mere rotation of office, being firſt made prefect of the prætorian bands, was now, by treaſon and accident, called to fill the throne. We are told but little of this emperor, except his engaging in a bloody though undecided battle with Artabanus king of Parthia, who came to take vengeance for the injury he had ſuſtained in the late reign: however, this monarch finding his real enemy dead, was content to make peace, and returned into Parthia. Something is alſo ſaid of the ſeverity of this emperor’s diſcipline; ſor to ſuch a pitch of licentiouſneſs was the Roman army now arrived, that the moſt ſevere puniſhments were unable to reſtrain the ſoldiers; and yet the moſt gentle inflictions were looked upon as ſeverity. It was this rigorous diſcipline, together with the artifices of Mæſa, grandmother to Heliogabalus the natural ſon of Caracalla, that cauſed the emperor’s ruin. Heliogabalus was prieſt of a temple dedicated to the Sun, in Emeſa, a city of Phoenicia; and though but 14 years old was greatly loved by the army for the beauty of his perſon, and the memory of his father, whom they ſtill conſidered as their greateſt benefactor. This was ſoon perceived by the grandmother 5 who being very rich in gold and jewels, gave liberal preſents among them, while they frequently repaired to the temple, both from the garriſon in the city and the camp of Macrinus. This intercourſe growing every day more frequent, the ſoldiers, being diſguſted with the ſeverities of their preſent emperor, began to think of placing Heliogabalus in his ſtead.
