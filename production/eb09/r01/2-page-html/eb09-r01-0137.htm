<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">burg, a young and ambitious voluptuary, caring for little but pleasure and display. On the great prelates the extortion of Rome sometimes fell not less heavily than on&nbsp;the laity; and the archbishop, before he could receive his&nbsp;pallium, was called upon to pay the sum of 30,000 gulden&nbsp;into the papal exchequer. Leo X. was at that time intent&nbsp;on carrying out the great design of his predecessor, the&nbsp;rebuilding of St Peter’s. It has been observed by Palla-vicino that the millions devoted to the erection of the&nbsp;material church were acquired at the cost of many more&nbsp;millions to the spiritual church. Leo proclaimed a fresh&nbsp;issue of indulgences, and the archbishop Albert was&nbsp;appointed his commissioner to carry out the sale in a large&nbsp;portion of Germany. He seized the occasion to prevail&nbsp;upon the pope to allow him to appropriate one half of the&nbsp;money collected for the indulgences in order to pay for&nbsp;his pallium. As his chief agent in the sale he imprudently&nbsp;selected one Tetzel, a Dominican friar, whose unscrupulousness in such work was so notorious that the papal collector&nbsp;at Mainz refused to employ him. In the course of his&nbsp;progress Tetzel came to Jiiterbogk, near Wittenberg, and&nbsp;his superstitious traffic and the impudent devices which&nbsp;he employed to cajole the people were thus brought&nbsp;directly under the notice of Luther. The young professor&nbsp;seized the opportunity of directing the attention of the&nbsp;university, where he was already highly popular, to the&nbsp;abuses associated with the sale of indulgences. He did&nbsp;not as yet impugn the doctrine of indulgences itself, and&nbsp;he expressed his conviction that their good father the&nbsp;pope must be altogether unaware of the extent to which&nbsp;such abuses were allowed to prevail. His celebrated theses&nbsp;were forwarded by himself to the archbishop, as well as&nbsp;to the elector of Saxony, his patron, and also the munificent founder of the university. The elector, who had&nbsp;seen with no slight dissatisfaction the manner in which&nbsp;his provinces were being plundered in order to pay for&nbsp;the extravagance of a neighbouring prelate, extended his&nbsp;protection to the courageous polemic, and Luther thus&nbsp;gained the all-precious interval of freedom from molestation which enabled him to compose the memorable treatises&nbsp;whereby he produced such an immense effect on the minds&nbsp;and consciences of his countrymen. The nailing of his&nbsp;theses to the door of the church at Wittenberg, it is to be&nbsp;noted, was a very common method of procedure on the&nbsp;part of a university disputant; and nearly a year passed&nbsp;away before the events which so deeply agitated Wittenberg were recognized in their full importance by the&nbsp;world at large. Luther himself, indeed, in his notable&nbsp;letter to Leo X., written in 1518, tells us@@<sup>1</sup> that, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">contrary&nbsp;to his wishes</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, his theses were translated into German, and&nbsp;circulated throughout the nation, and that his antagonists&nbsp;declared that he had set the world in flames. But.in this&nbsp;language there is evidently something of exaggeration.&nbsp;Some two months after the appearance of Luther’s theses&nbsp;Tetzel, by way of rejoinder, published at the university&nbsp;of Frankfort-on־the-Oder a hundred and six anti-theses,&nbsp;and these were subsequently burnt by the students of&nbsp;Wittenberg in the market-place. To Leo, however, the&nbsp;vague reports that reached Rome conveyed only the impression of a dispute between the two monastic orders of&nbsp;which Luther and Tetzel were respectively the representatives. He declared that Luther was a man of genius, and&nbsp;refused to interfere. Even Ulrich von Hutten, at that&nbsp;time residing not far from Wittenberg, seems to have&nbsp;shared in this misapprehension, and, writing to his patron,&nbsp;he expresses the hope that the two contending parties&nbsp;may eventually tear each other to pieces.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">But in the course of a few months the importance of the struggle began to be more clearly apprehended. John Eck</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Werke,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> ed. 1883, i. 528.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of Ingoldstadt drew attention to the resemblance between Lu the doctrines put forth in the theses and those of the<sup>rel&nbsp;</sup>Hussites, and at the mention of that undoubted heresy not &quot;&nbsp;a few of Luther’s supporters recoiled. His conduct was * <sup>J&nbsp;</sup>certainly not wanting in astuteness, however genuine his&nbsp;enthusiasm. In 1518 he republished his theses, with additions and explanations, under the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Solutions.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Like&nbsp;Hutten, he selected the supreme pontiff himself as the&nbsp;person to whom he dedicated the treatise. In the letter&nbsp;of dedication (the letter above referred to) he professes to&nbsp;make his unqualified submission to him whom he addresses,&nbsp;and at the same time endeavours to exculpate himself for&nbsp;thus republishing the theses. Notwithstanding the popular&nbsp;form, the vernacular language, in which they had already&nbsp;appeared, they were still so encumbered with the technicalities of the schools that he could not conceive how they&nbsp;could be intelligible to the laity at large (“sic editae ut&nbsp;mihi incredibile sit eas ab omnibus intelligi ”). He was&nbsp;therefore anxious, with the pontiff’s sanction and approval,&nbsp;to republish them in a form less liable to misinterpretation.&nbsp;If, however, that sanction were withheld, he could only bow&nbsp;to Leo’s decision as to that of God’s vicegerent on earth&nbsp;(“ vocem tuam vocem Christ! in te praesidentis et loquentis&nbsp;agnoscam ”). While Luther was thus labouring under misapprehension, affected or real, with respect to the kind of&nbsp;doctrinal teaching that was likely to find favour in Rome,&nbsp;it would seem that Leo himself was very imperfectly informed regarding the state of feeling in Germany. The&nbsp;conditions which moulded his political action and his&nbsp;personal sympathies alike tended to distract his attention&nbsp;from the events which had recently been occurring in&nbsp;Saxony. The representative of a princely house, well&nbsp;versed in European affairs and in questions of statecraft,&nbsp;gifted with more than an ordinary share of Italian subtlety&nbsp;and powers of dissimulation, he was well qualified to cope&nbsp;with the difficulties by which he found himself surrounded.&nbsp;But his aims, chief among which was his desire to establish&nbsp;his brother Julian on the throne of Naples, were directed&nbsp;more to family aggrandizement than to national unity.&nbsp;They ran strongly counter to the growth of Spanish influence, while with that stern policy which guided the rule&nbsp;of Ximenes, dictated by the desire to restore mediaeval&nbsp;doctrine and discipline and to suppress heresy, he had no&nbsp;sympathy. The ecclesiastic was almost lost in the patron&nbsp;of the arts, the urbane and polished scholar and voluptuary,&nbsp;the admirer of wit and epigram. In politics it was his&nbsp;main purpose to trim the balance between France and&nbsp;Spain; in church matters it was chiefly to stifle controversy. So indifferent was he to German affairs, and so&nbsp;little cognizant of the state of feeling among the people,&nbsp;that at the very moment when irritation at the extortion&nbsp;of his emissaries was at its height, and the fraudulent&nbsp;nature of that extortion had been thus ably exposed by&nbsp;Luther, he conceived it to be a suitable time for levying&nbsp;a contribution throughout the empire under pretext of an&nbsp;expedition against the Turks. The proposal roused a spirit&nbsp;of opposition even among the clergy themselves; and one&nbsp;of their number, a prebendary at Würzburg, issued a manifesto, in the form of a pamphlet, in which he roundly declared that the true Turks were to be found in Italy. This&nbsp;pamphlet fell into Luther’s hands, and with the instinct of&nbsp;genius he recognized the opportunity afforded by such a&nbsp;state of feeling for an appeal to a wider audience than he&nbsp;had hitherto addressed. He now took his stand as the denouncer both of abuses in the matter of discipline and of&nbsp;the extortion and oppression under which his countrymen&nbsp;laboured. And from that day to the day of his death he&nbsp;filled a ¡)lace in their affection and esteem to which no&nbsp;other of their leaders could make pretence. The turning-point in his public career is marked by his appearance at</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
