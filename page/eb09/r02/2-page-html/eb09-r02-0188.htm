<p><span class="font1">Roland seems to be the 12th-century statue in the church of San Zeno at Verona.@@<sup>1</sup> The whole history of Roncesvalles is blazoned&nbsp;in the 13th-century window in Chartres cathedral.@@<sup>2</sup> A similar&nbsp;window existed formerly in the abbey church of St Denis. M.&nbsp;Vétault </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Hist. de Ch.,</span><span class="font1"> p. 496) has also figured a Carolingian coin&nbsp;which bears the names of both Roland and Charles. The so-called&nbsp;Roland statues of Germany are most probably symbolical of the&nbsp;judicial and other rights once possessed by the people of those&nbsp;towns where they are to be found. In some cases at least the&nbsp;name seems to have been transferred to what were originally meant&nbsp;to be representations of the first Othos (10th century). The earliest&nbsp;known allusion to a “ statua Rolandi ” under this name occurs in&nbsp;a privilegium granted by Henry V. to the town of Bremen (1111).&nbsp;The word “Rolandssäule” is perhaps a piece of folk-etymology&nbsp;for an earlier “Rothland-säule” or red-land-pillar, i.e., the before-mentioned figure or pillar, which signified that the state in which&nbsp;it stood had the power of life and death,—in other words, was a&nbsp;Blutgerichtstätte. Grimm suspects a connexion between the Roland&nbsp;statues and those old Teutonic pillars of which the Irminsul destroyed by Charlemagne is the best-known example.@@<sup>3</sup> These Roland&nbsp;statues are sometimes in the open air, as at Bremen and Magdeburg ;&nbsp;or against the town-house, as at Halberstadt ; or in the church,&nbsp;as formerly at Göttingen. Sometimes they ride on horseback, as&nbsp;at Haldensleben near Magdeburg ; but more generally they are to&nbsp;be found standing upright. They always bear a sword in their&nbsp;right hand and very frequently a shield in their left. They are&nbsp;usually armoured, as at Magdeburg, but are occasionally dressed in&nbsp;more peaceful robes, as at Halle (on the Saale), or both cloaked and&nbsp;armoured, as at Wedel in Holstein and at Bremen. Sometimes they&nbsp;are crowned, as at Wedel and Nordhausen. The heads of the statues&nbsp;differ extremely,—being long-bearded at Erfurt, short-bearded at&nbsp;Wedel, and absolutely smooth-faced at Bremen. At Brandenburg&nbsp;the Roland was ornamented with silver and perhaps with gold.&nbsp;The statues are often of colossal height, that of Belgern (Merseburg)&nbsp;being over 9 ells high, exclusive of its pedestal. Perhaps the&nbsp;most famous Roland pillar still remaining is that of Bremen.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROLLER, a very beautiful bird so called from its way of occasionally rolling or turning over in its flight,</span><span class="font1">@@</span><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> somewhat after the fashion of a Tumbler-Pigeon. It is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Coracias garruius</span><span class="font2"> of ornithology, and is widely though not&nbsp;very numerously spread over Europe and Western Asia in&nbsp;summer, breeding so far to the northward as the middle&nbsp;of Sweden, but retiring to winter in Africa. It occurs&nbsp;almost every year in some part or other of the British&nbsp;Islands, from Cornwall to the Shetlands, while it has&nbsp;visited Ireland several times, and is even recorded from St.&nbsp;Kilda. But it is only as a wanderer that it comes hither,&nbsp;since there is no evidence of its having ever attempted to&nbsp;breed in Great Britain ; and indeed its conspicuous appearance—for it is nearly as big as a Daw and very brightly&nbsp;coloured—would forbid its being ever allowed to escape&nbsp;the gun of the always ready murderers of stray birds.&nbsp;Except the back, scapulars, and tertials, which are bright&nbsp;reddish-brown, the plumage of both sexes is almost entirely&nbsp;blue—of various shades, from pale turquoise to dark ultra-marine—tinted in parts with green. The bird seems to be&nbsp;purely insectivorous. The genus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Coracias,</span><span class="font2"> for a long while&nbsp;placed by systematists among the Crows, has really no&nbsp;affinity whatever to them, and is now properly considered to&nbsp;belong to the heterogeneous group of Birds in this work&nbsp;called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pixariæ </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Ornithology, vol. xviii. p. 41), in which</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;">

<p><span class="font2">ROLLIN, Charles (1661-1741), was born at Paris on 30th January 1661. He was the son of a tradesman, but&nbsp;distinguished himself at school, and at the age of twenty-two was made a master in the Collége du Plessis. He&nbsp;was successively promoted to various other posts of the&nbsp;same kind. In 1694 he was rector of the university of&nbsp;Paris. He held that post for two years instead of one,&nbsp;and was then appointed principal of the Collége de Beauvais. He was of Jansenist principles, and in the later&nbsp;years of his life was for this cause deprived of his appointments and disqualified for the rectorship, to which in 1719&nbsp;he had been re-elected. It is said that the same reason&nbsp;prevented his election to the French Academy, though he&nbsp;was a member of the Academy of Inscriptions. He was&nbsp;concerned in the affair of the deacon Paris, and shortly&nbsp;before his death (14th December 1741) protested publicly&nbsp;against the acceptance of the bull Unigenitus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rollin’s literary work dates chiefly from the later years of his life, when he had been forbidden to teach. His once famous&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Atvcient History</span><span class="font1"> (Paris, 1730-38) and the less generally read </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Roman&nbsp;History</span><span class="font1"> which followed it were avowed compilations, and compilations which were not only far from critical but even somewhat inaccurate. But they have hàd the merit not merely of instructing&nbsp;but of interesting generation after generation almost to the present day. A more original and really important work, though less&nbsp;generally known out of France, was his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Traité des Etudes</span><span class="font1"> (Paris,&nbsp;1726-31). It contains a summary of what was even then a reformed&nbsp;and innovating system of education, including a more frequent and&nbsp;extensive use of the vulgar tongue and discarding the mediæval&nbsp;traditions that had lingered in France. It had very considerable&nbsp;influence. Rollin’s style is good and his personal character was&nbsp;irreproachable.</span></p>
