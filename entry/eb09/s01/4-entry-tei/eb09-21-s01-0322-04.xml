 (1757-1836), English admiral, was descended from an old family, and was born at St Peter Port, Guernsey, 11th March 1757. Many of his ancestors had distinguished themselves in the naval service, and he entered it as midshipman at the age of thirteen. For his bravery at the attack of Charleston in 1775 on board the “Bristol” he was raised to the rank of lieutenant, and he was promoted commander for his gallant services off the Dogger Bank, 5th August 1781, when he was wounded. In command of the “ Russell,” he contributed to Rodney’s victory over De Grasse, 12th April 1782. For the capture of “La Réunion,” a French frigate, in 1793 he received the honour of knighthood. While in command of a small squadron he was on 5th June 1794 attacked by a superior French force on the way from Plymouth to Guernsey, but by his seamanship and coolness succeeded in gaining a safe anchorage in the harbour of that island. After being promoted to the “Orion” of 74 guns in 1795, he took part in the defeat of the French fleet off L’Orient, 22d June, distinguished himself in the battle of Cape St Vincent in February 1797, and was present at the blockade of Cadiz from February 1797 to April 1798, and at the battle of the Nile, 1st August 1798, where he was wounded. On his return from Egypt he received the</p><p>command of the “Cæsar,” 84 guns, with orders to watch the French fleet off Brest during the winters of 1799 and 1800. In 1801 he was raised to the rank of rear-admiral of the blue, was created a baronet, and received the command of a small squadron which was destined to watch the movements of the Spanish fleet at Cadiz. To prevent a fleet of British merchantmen from falling into the hands of the enemy, he engaged the French and Spanish fleets, which outnumbered his own small squadron by two to one, inflicting on them a severe defeat with a loss of 3000 men. Regarding this achievement Lord Nelson remarked that “a greater action was never fought.” For his services Saumarez was rewarded with the order of the Bath, and he also received the freedom of the city of London, together with a magnificent sword. In 1803 he received a pension of £1200 a year. On the outbreak of the war with Russia in 1809 he was entrusted with the command of the Baltic fleet, and in recognition of his services Charles XIII. of Sweden bestowed on him the grand cross of the military order of the Sword. At the peace of 1814 he attained the rank of admiral; and in 1819 he was made rear- admiral, in 1821 vice-admiral of Great Britain. He was raised to the peerage as Baron de Saumarez in 1831, and died at Guernsey, 9th October 1836.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Admiral Lord de Saumarez,</hi> by Sir John Ross, 2 vols., 1838.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
