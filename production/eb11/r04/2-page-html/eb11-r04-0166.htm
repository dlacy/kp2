<p><span class="font0">the past. But the Romans received them with doubt and mistrust, for they saw that the revolution threatened to dismember the state, by promoting the independence of every&nbsp;separate city. Besides, while maintaining their republic, they&nbsp;also desired the pope’s presence in Rome. Nevertheless, they&nbsp;went with the current to the extent of reforming their constitution. In February 1376 they nominated Giovanni Cenci&nbsp;captain of the people, and gave him uncontrolled power over&nbsp;the towns of the patrimony and the Sabine land. The conservators, with their new political authority, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">executores,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">antepositi</span><span class="font0"> and the two councils were all preserved, and a&nbsp;new magistracy was created, the “Tres Gubematores Pacis&nbsp;et Libcrtatis Reipublicae Romanae.” This answered to the&nbsp;Eight (afterwards Ten) of War in Florence, likewise frequently&nbsp;called the Eight of Liberty and Peace. It was this Council&nbsp;of Eight that was now directing the war against the pope and&nbsp;braving his sentence of excommunication; and their fiery&nbsp;zeal had won them the title of the Holy Eight from the&nbsp;Florentines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Realizing that further absence would cost him his state, Gregory XI. quitted Avignon on the 13th of September 1376,&nbsp;and, reaching Corneto in December, despatched to Rome three&nbsp;legates, who, on the 21st of the month, concluded an agreement with the parliament. The people gave up the gates, the&nbsp;fortresses and the Trastevcre, and promised that if the pope&nbsp;returned to Rome he should have the same powers which had&nbsp;been granted to Urban V. But, on his side, he must pledge&nbsp;himself to maintain the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">executores</span><span class="font0"> and their council, and allow&nbsp;the Romans the right of reforming the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi,</span><span class="font0"> who would&nbsp;then swear fealty to him. The terms of this peace and the&nbsp;pope’s epistles clearly prove that the two councils still exercised&nbsp;their functions, that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi wee</span><span class="font0"> still the virtual heads&nbsp;of the government, and that their suppression was not contemplated. In fact, when the pope made his entry on the&nbsp;17th of January 1377, accompanied by two thousand armed men,&nbsp;he perceived that there was much public agitation, that the&nbsp;Romans did not intend to fulfil their agreement, and that the&nbsp;government of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi</span><span class="font0"> went on as before. Accordingly,&nbsp;after naming Gomez Albornoz, a nephew' of the deceased&nbsp;cardinal, to the office of senator, he retired to Anagni, and&nbsp;remained there until November 1377. The Romans presently&nbsp;waited on him with conciliating offers, and begged him to&nbsp;negotiate a peace for them with the prefect of Vico. In fact,&nbsp;the treaty was concluded at Anagni in October, and on the&nbsp;10th of November confirmed in Rome by the general council.&nbsp;The meeting was held in the great hall of the Capitol,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ubi consilia generalia urbis fieri solent,</span><span class="font0"> in the presence of&nbsp;all the members of the republican government. But the&nbsp;pope was enraged by the survival of this government, and,&nbsp;being worn out by the persistent hostility of the Florentines,&nbsp;which reduced his power to a low ebb, had determined to&nbsp;make peace, when surprised by death on the 27th of March&nbsp;1378.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The next pope, Urban VI. (1378-89), a Neapolitan, was the spirit of discord incarnate. His election was not altogether&nbsp;regular: the French party among the cardinals was against&nbsp;him; and the people were ripe for insurrection. But, regardless&nbsp;of all this, Urban threatened the cardinals in his first consistory, saying that church reform must begin with them;&nbsp;and he used the same tone with the people, reproving them&nbsp;for failing to suppress the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi.</span><span class="font0"> In consequence of this&nbsp;the cardinals of the French party, assembling at Fondi, elected&nbsp;the antipope Clement VII. (1378-94) and started a long and&nbsp;painful schism in the church. Clement resided in Avignon,&nbsp;while Urban in Rome was engaged in opposing Queen&nbsp;Joanna I. of Naples and favouring Charles of Durazzo, who,&nbsp;on conquering the Neapolitan kingdom, was made gonfalonier&nbsp;of the church and senator of Rome, where he left a vicar as&nbsp;his deputy. Shortly afterwards the pope went to Naples,&nbsp;and made fierce war on the king. Then, after many .adventures,&nbsp;during which he tortured and put to death several cardinals&nbsp;whom he suspected of hostile intentions, he returned to Rome,&nbsp;where the utmost disorder prevailed. The conservators and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi</span><span class="font0"> were still at the head of the government, and, the pope speedily falling out with them,&nbsp;a riot ensued, after which he excommunicated the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi.</span><span class="font0"> These at last made submission to him,&nbsp;and Urban VI. became master of Rome before his&nbsp;death in 1389. He was succeeded by Boniface IX.&nbsp;(1389-1404), another Neapolitan, but a man of greater shrewdness and capacity. His first act was to crown Ladislaus&nbsp;king of Naples, and secure the friendship and protection of&nbsp;this ambitious and powerful prince. In all the principal&nbsp;cities of the state he chose the reigning lords for his vicars.&nbsp;But he allowed, Fermo, Ascoli and Bologna the privilege&nbsp;of assuming their own vicariate for twenty-five years. And,&nbsp;as.these different potentates and governments had only to&nbsp;pay him an annual tribute, all parties were satisfied, and&nbsp;the pope was able to bestow at least an appearance of order&nbsp;and unity on his state. But fresh tumults soon arose, partly&nbsp;because the conservators and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi</span><span class="font0"> sought to govern on&nbsp;their own account, and especially because the pope seems&nbsp;for a time to have omitted naming the senator. Boniface was&nbsp;a prudent man; he saw tliat events were turning in his favour,&nbsp;now that throughout Italy liberty was tottering to its fall, and&nbsp;bided his time. He was satisfied for the moment by obtaining&nbsp;a recognition of the immunities of the clergy, rendering them&nbsp;solely amenable to ecclesiastical tribunals,- and thus distinguishing the powers of the church from those of the state in Rome.&nbsp;The republic also pledged itself neither to molest the prelates&nbsp;nor to levy fresh contributions on them towards repairing&nbsp;the walls, to aid in recovering the estates of the church in&nbsp;Tuscia, and to try to conciliate the baronage. This concordat,&nbsp;concluded with the conservators and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi</span><span class="font0"> on the nth of&nbsp;September 1391, was also confirmed on the 5th of March&nbsp;1392 by the heads of the regions, together with a fresh treaty&nbsp;binding both parties to furnish a certain number of armed&nbsp;men to combat the prefect of Vico and the adherents of the&nbsp;antipope at Viterbo. With the exception of this city, Orchi&nbsp;and Civita Vecchia, all other conquered territory was to belong&nbsp;to the republic. But the Romans soon discovered that they&nbsp;were playing into the hands of the pope, who kept everything&nbsp;for himself, without even paying the troops. Upon this a riot&nbsp;broke out; Boniface fled to Perugia in October 1392, and resolved&nbsp;to exact better terms when next recalled to Rome. Meanwhile&nbsp;the Romans subdued the prefect, captured Viterbo, and, being&nbsp;already repentant, handed it over to the pope and implored&nbsp;his return. He then proposed his own terms, which were&nbsp;approved, not only by the conservators, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and four councillors, but also by the special council&nbsp;and by the unanimous vote of a general assembly,&nbsp;composed of the above-mentioned authorities, heads&nbsp;of regions, other officials and a hundred citizens&nbsp;(8th August 1393). These terms prescribed that the&nbsp;pope was to elect the senator, and that, on his failing&nbsp;so to do, the conservators would carry on the government&nbsp;after swearing fealty to him. The senatorial function was&nbsp;to be neither controlled nor hampered by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;immunities of the clergy were to be preserved, and all church&nbsp;property was to be respected by the magistrates. The expenses&nbsp;of the pope’s journey were to be paid, and he was to be escorted&nbsp;to Rome in state. Boniface tried to complete his work by&nbsp;abolishing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi,</span><span class="font0"> the last bulwarks of freedom; but&nbsp;the people, although weakened and weary, made efforts to&nbsp;preserve them and, although their fall was inevitable, the&nbsp;struggle went on for some time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the spring of 1394 the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">banderesi</span><span class="font0"> provoked an insurrection in which the .pope’s life was endangered; it was only saved by the arrival of King Ladislaus, who came from Naples&nbsp;with a large force in the early autumn. But for the Neapolitan&nbsp;soldiery Boniface could not have withstood the long series of&nbsp;revolts that continually exposed him to fresh perils and the&nbsp;anxiety caused by the persistent schism of the church. The&nbsp;death of Clement VII. in 1394 was followed by the election of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
