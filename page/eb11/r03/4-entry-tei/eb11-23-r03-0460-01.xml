                <p><label>ROHAN, HENRI</label>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Duc de</hi> (1579-1638), French
                    soldier, writer and leader of the Huguenots, was born at the château of Blain,
                    in Brittany, in 1579. His father was René II., count of Rohan (1550-86), and
                    head of one of the oldest and most distinguished families in France, which was
                    connected with many of the reigning houses of Europe. He was educated by his
                    mother, who was a woman of exceptional learning and force of character. Rohan
                    was by birth the second son, but his elder brother René dying young he became
                    the heir of the name. He appeared at court and in the army at the age of
                    sixteen, and was a special favourite with Henry IV., after whom, failing the
                    house of Condé, he might be said to be the natural chief of the French
                    Protestants. Having served till the peace of Vervins, he travelled for a
                    considerable time over Europe, including England and Scotland, in the first of
                    which countries he received the not unique honour of being called by Elizabeth
                    her knight, while in the second he was godfather at Charles I/s christening. On
                    his return to France he was made duke and peer at the age of twenty-four, and
                    two years later (1603) married Marguerite de Béthune, the duc de Sully’s
                    daughter. He served in high command at the celebrated siege of Jülich in 1610,
                    but soon afterwards he fell into active or passive opposition to the government
                    over the religious disputes. For a time, however, he abstained from actual
                    insurrection, and he endeavoured to keep on terms with Marie de’ Medici; he
                    even, despite his dislike of De Luynes, the favourite of Louis XIII., reappeared
                    in the army and fought in Lorraine and Piedmont. It was not till the decree for
                    the restitution of church property in the south threw the Bearnese and Gascons
                    into open revolt that Rohan appeared as a rebel. His authority and military
                    skill were very formidable to the royalists; his constancy and firmness greatly
                    contributed to the happy issue of the war for the Huguenots, and brought about
                    the treaty of Montpellier (1623). But Rohan did not escape the results of the
                    incurable factiousness which showed itself more strongly perhaps among the
                    French Huguenots than among any other of the numerous armed oppositions of the
                    17th century. He was accused of lukewarmness and treachery, though he did not
                    hesitate to renew the war when the compact of Montpellier was broken. Again a
                    hollow peace was patched up, but it lasted but a short time, and Rohan undertook
                    a third war (1627-29), the first events of which are recounted in his celebrated
                        <hi rend="italic">Memoirs.</hi> This last war (famous for the defence of La
                    Rochelle by Soubise, Rohan’s younger brother) was one of considerable danger for
                    Rohan. In spite of all efforts he had in the end to sign a peace, and after this
                    he made his way quickly to Venice. Here he is said to have received from the
                    Porte the offer of the sovereignty of Cyprus. It is more certain that his hosts
                    of Venice wished to make him their general-in-chief, a design not executed owing
                    to the,peace of Cherasco (1631). At Venice he wrote his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Memoirs,</hi> at Padua, <hi rend="italic">Le Parfait Capitaine.</hi> But
                    when France began to play a more conspicuous part in the Thirty Years’ War Rohan
                    was again called to serve his lawful sovereign, and entrusted with the war in
                    the Valtelline. The campaign of 1633 was completely successful, but Rohan was
                    still considered dangerous to France, and was soon again in retirement. At this
                    time he wrote his <hi rend="italic">Traité du gouvernement des treize
                        cantons.</hi> Rohan fought another Valtelline campaign, but without the
                    success of the first, for the motives of France were now held in suspicion. The
                    unfortunate commander retired to Geneva and thence went to the army of Bernhard
                    of Saxe-Weimar. He received a mortal wound at the battle of Rheinfelden on the
                    28th of February 1638, and died at the abbey of Königsfeld, canton Berne, on the
                    13th of April. His body was buried at Geneva, and his arms were solemnly handed
                    over to the Venetian government. With his daughter Marguerite the honours of
                    the family of Rohan-Gie passed to the house of Chabot.</p>               <p>Rohan’s <hi rend="italic">Mémoires sur les choses qui se sont passées en
                        France,</hi> &amp;c., rank amongst the best products of the singular
                    talent for memoir writing which the French <hi rend="italic">noblesse</hi> of
                    the 16th and 17th centuries possessed. Alike in style, in clearness of matter
                    and in shrewdness, they deserve very high praise. The first three books, dealing
                    with the civil wars, appeared in 164^4; the fourth, containing the narrative of
                    the Valtelline campaigns, not till 1758. Some suspicions were thrown on the
                    genuineness of the latter, but, it would seem, groundlessly. His famous book on
                    the history and art of war, <hi rend="italic">Le Parfait Capitaine,</hi>
                    appeared in 1631 and subsequently in 1637 and 1693 (see also Quincy, <hi
                        rend="italic">Art de la guerre,</hi> Paris, 1741). It treats of the history
                    and lessons of Caesar’s campaigns and their application to modern warfare, and
                    contains appendices dealing with phalangite and legionary methods of fighting
                    and the art of war in general. He also wrote an account of his travels, the book
                    on Switzerland mentioned above, <hi rend="italic">De l’intérêt des princes et
                        états de la chrétienté,</hi> etc. The <hi rend="italic">Memoirs</hi> may be
                    conveniently found in the collection of Michaud and Poujoulat, vol. 19.</p>               <p>See Fauvelet de Foix, <hi rend="italic">Histoire du Duc Henri de Rohan</hi>
