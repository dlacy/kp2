<p><span class="font1">degree that in the female may afterwards lead to serious difficulties in parturition. The head of the rickety child is large-looking in its upper part, the individual bones of the cranium sometimes remaining long ununited, while the face is small&nbsp;and ill-developed, and the teeth appear late and fall out or&nbsp;decay early. The constitutional conditions of ill-health continue,&nbsp;and the nutrition and development of the child are greatly&nbsp;retarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The disease may terminate in recovery, with more or less of deformity and dwarfing, the bones although altered in&nbsp;shape becoming firmly ossified, and this is the common result&nbsp;in the majority of instances. On the other hand, during the&nbsp;progress of the disease, various intercurrent ailments are apt&nbsp;to arise which may cause death, such as the infectious fevers,&nbsp;bronchitis and other pulmonary affections, chronic hydrocephalus,&nbsp;convulsions, laryngismus stridulus, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An acute form of rickets of rare occurrence (really a form of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">scurvy, q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> has been described by writers on diseases&nbsp;of children, in which all the symptoms are of more rapid&nbsp;development and progress, the result in many instances being&nbsp;fatal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The treatment of rickets is necessarily more hygienic than medicinal, and includes such preventive measures as may be&nbsp;exercised by strict attention to personal health and nutrition&nbsp;on the part of mothers, especially where there appears to be&nbsp;any tendency to a rickety development in any members of&nbsp;the family. Very important also is the avoidance of too&nbsp;prolonged nursing, which by its weakening effects upon the&nbsp;mother’s health is calculated to engender the disease in any&nbsp;succeeding children. At the same time it must be admitted&nbsp;that, when the mother is healthy, her milk abundant, and&nbsp;nursing discontinued before the lapse of the first year, there&nbsp;is no better means of preventing the occurrence of rickets than&nbsp;this method of feeding an infant, the disease, as is well known,&nbsp;being far more frequently met with in children brought up&nbsp;by hand. The management of the child exhibiting any tendency&nbsp;to rickets is of great importance, but can only be alluded to in&nbsp;general terms. The digestive disorders characteristic of the setting&nbsp;in of the disease render necessary the greatest care and watchfulness as to diet. Thus, if the child be not nursed but fed&nbsp;artificially, fresh milk should be almost the only article of diet&nbsp;for at least the first year, and the chief element for the next.&nbsp;When not digested well, as may at times be shown by its&nbsp;appearance as a curd in the evacuations, it may be diluted&nbsp;with water or lime water, or else discontinued for a short time,&nbsp;carefully-made gruel or barley water being substituted. Many&nbsp;of the so-called “ infants’ foods ” which are now so extensively&nbsp;used appear to be well adapted for their purpose, but when&nbsp;employed too abundantly and to the exclusion of the due amount&nbsp;of milk are often productive of digestive and intestinal disorders,&nbsp;probably from their containing a greater amount of starchy&nbsp;matter than can be utilized. From the end of the first year&nbsp;light animal soups may occasionally be given with advantage.&nbsp;The medicinal remedies most to be relied on are those which&nbsp;improve the digestive functions and minister to nutrition, and&nbsp;indude such agents as the preparations of iron, quinine, and&nbsp;especially cod-liver oil and phosphorus, and the cautious use&nbsp;of extract of thyroid gland has been advocated by Henoch.&nbsp;Of no less importance, however, are abundance of fresh air,&nbsp;cleanliness, warm clothing, and attention to the general hygiene&nbsp;of the child and to regularity in all its functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">When the disease is showing evidence of advancing, it is desirable to restrain the child from walking, as far as possible.&nbsp;But this precaution may be to some extent rendered unnecessary&nbsp;by the use of splints and other apparatus as supports for the&nbsp;limbs and body, enabling the child to move about without the&nbsp;risk of bending and deformity of the bones which otherwise&nbsp;would probably be the result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The condition formerly known as foetal rickets (achondroplasia or chondrodystrophia foetalis) is now classed as a separate&nbsp;disease. Its chief characteristics are dwarfism with shortening&nbsp;of the limbs and enormous enlargment of the articulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICKMAK, THOMAS (1776-1841), English architect, was born on the 8th of June 1776 at Maidenhead, Berkshire, where&nbsp;he assisted his father (a Quaker) in business as a grocer and&nbsp;druggist until 1797. He was then engaged in various businesses&nbsp;until 1818. All his spare time was spent in sketching and&nbsp;making careful measured drawings, till he gained </span><span class="font0">a</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">knowledge&nbsp;of architecture which was very remarkable at a time when little&nbsp;taste existed for the beauties of the Gothic styles. In 1811&nbsp;alone he is said to have studied three thousand ecclesiastical&nbsp;buildings. When in 1818 a large grant of money was made by&nbsp;the government to build new churches, Rickman sent in a design&nbsp;of his own which was successful in an open competition; thus he&nbsp;was fairly launched upon the profession of an architect, for&nbsp;which his natural gifts strongly fitted him. Rickman then&nbsp;moved to Birmingham, and by 1830 became one of the most&nbsp;successful architects of his time. Hc built churches at Hampton&nbsp;Lucy, Ombersley, and Stretton-on-Dunsmore, St George’s at&nbsp;Birmingham, St Philip’s and St Matthew’s in Bristol, two in&nbsp;Carlisle, St Peter’s and St Paul’s at Preston, St David’s in&nbsp;Glasgow, Grey Friars at Coventry, and many others. He also&nbsp;designed the new court of St John’s College, Cambridge, a palace&nbsp;for the bishop of Carlisle, and several large country houses.&nbsp;These are all in the Gothic style, but show more knowledge of&nbsp;the outward form of the medieval style than any real acquaintance with its spirit, and are little better than dull copies of old&nbsp;work, disfigured by much poverty of detail. Rickman nevertheless played an important part in the revival of taste for&nbsp;medievalism perhaps second only to Pugin His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Attempt to&nbsp;discriminate the Stylés of Architecture in England</span><span class="font1"> shows painstaking research, and ran through many editions. Rickman&nbsp;died at Birmingham on the 4th of January 1841. He was&nbsp;married three times: first to his cousin, Lucy Rickman of&nbsp;Lewes; secondly to Christiana Hornor; thirdly to Elizabeth&nbsp;Miller of Edinburgh, by whom he had a son and a daughter. </span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICKMANSWORTH, an urban district in the Watford parliamentary division of Hertfordshire, England; 17I m.&nbsp;W.N.W. of London by the Metropolitan &amp; Great Central&nbsp;joint railway; served also by a branch of the London &amp; North&nbsp;Western railway from Watford. Pop. (1901) 5627. It lies in&nbsp;pleasant valley at the junction of the Chess with the Colne, and&nbsp;on the Grand Junction canal. The church of St Mary, with&nbsp;the exception of the tower a modern reconstruction, contains&nbsp;some French stained glass of the 16th century. The chief&nbsp;industries are brewing and art-printing. The Colne here holds&nbsp;large trout, which are carefully preserved. The grounds of&nbsp;Moor Park tothe south-east are finely wooded, and the mansion,&nbsp;belonging to Lord Ebury, is a good example of the period of&nbsp;George I. The estate counts among its former owners such&nbsp;famous names as the Botelers; George Neville, archbishop of&nbsp;York; John de Vere, earl of Oxford in Henry VII.’s time;&nbsp;Wolsey in the next reign; Robert Carey, earl of Monmouth,&nbsp;and the duke of Monmouth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICOCHET, a military term expressing the rebound of a projectile that strikes on a hard surface. The origin of the&nbsp;French word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ricochet</span><span class="font1"> is unknown. Its earliest known use&nbsp;(14th and 15th centuries) was in the sense of “ repetition,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g. chanson du ricochet, “</span><span class="font1"> an oft-told tale.” Hence it came to&nbsp;be applied to the rebound of a flat stone skimmed along the&nbsp;surface of water, known familiarly in English as “ ducks and&nbsp;drakes,” and so finally in the military sense defined above,&nbsp;which found its way into the English language.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The use of the now obsolete “ ricochet fire ” in war is well illustrated by “ ducks and drakes.” The shot, striking the&nbsp;ground at a small angle, described for the remainder of its&nbsp;course a succession of leaps and falls. The discovery of this&nbsp;species of fire, usually attributed to Vauban (siege of Ath in&nbsp;1697), had the greatest influence both on sieges and on operations&nbsp;in the field. In siege warfare, ricochet, especially when combined with enfiIade, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font1"> when directed along the enemy’s line&nbsp;of defence, soon became the principal weapon of the besieger,&nbsp;and with the system of parallels </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.vf</span><span class="font1"> gave the attack a superiority so complete that a siege came to be considered as the most</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
