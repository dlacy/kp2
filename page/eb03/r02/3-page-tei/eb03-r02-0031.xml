Being thus cramm’d in the baſket, a couple of Ford’s knaves, his hinds, were call’d forth by their miſtreſs, to carry me in the name of foul clothes to Datchet-lane. They took me on their ſhoulders, met the jealous knave their maſter in the door, who aſk’d them once or twice what they had in their baſket. I quak’d ſor fear, left the lunatic knave would have ſearch’d it ; but Fate, ordaining he ſhould be a cuckold, held his hand. Well, on went he for a ſearch, and away went I for foul clothes. But mark the ſe-quel, Maſter Brook. I ſuffer’d the pangs of three egregious deaths : firſt, an intolerable fright, to be detected by a jealous rotten bell-weather ; next, to be compaſs’d like a good bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to point, heel to head ; and then to be ſtopt in, like a ſtrong diſtillation, with ſtinking clothes that fretted in their own greaſe. Think of that, a man of my kidney ; think of that, that am as ſubject to heat as butter ; a man of continual diſſolution and thaw ; it was a miracle to 'ſcape ſuffocation. And in the height of this bath, when I was more than half ſtew’d in greaſe, like a Dutch diſli, to be thrown into the Thames, and cool’d glowing hot, in that ſurge, like a horſe-ſhoe ; think of that ; hilſing hot ; think of that, Mr Brook.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Merry Wives of Windfοr, aft $»ſc.</hi>  17.</p><p>RITE, among divines, denotes the particular manner of celebrating divine ſervice in this or that country.</p><p>RITORNELLO, or Repeat, in muſic, the burden of a ſong, or the repetition of the firſt or other verſes of a ſong at the end of each couplet.</p><p>RITTERHUSIUS (Conrad), a learned German civilian, born at Brunſwick in 1560.

The ancient heathens had alſo their rituals, which contained their rites and ceremonies to be obſerved in building a city, conſecrating a temple or altar, in ſacriſicing, and deifying, in dividing the curiæ, tribes, centuries, and in general, in all their religious ceremonies. There are ſeveral paſſages in Cato’s books, <hi rend="italic">De re Raſtica, </hi>which may give us ſome idea of the rituals of the ancients.</p><p>RIVAL, a term applied to two or more perſons who have the ſame pretenſions ; and which is properly applied to a competitor in love, and figuratively to an antagoniſt in any other purſuit.</p><lb/><p>RIVER,</p><p>IS a current of ſreſh water, flowing in a Bed or Channel from its ſource to the ſea.</p><p>The term is appropriated to a <hi rend="italic">conſiderable</hi>  collection of waters, formed by the conflux of two or more Baooκs, which deliver into its channel the united ſtreams of ſeveral Rivulets, which have collected the ſupplies of many Rills trickling down from number-leſs ſprings, and the torrents which carry off from the ſloping grounds the ſurplus of every ſhower.</p><p>Rivers form one of the chief features of the ſurface of this globe, ſerving as voiders of all that is immediately redundant in our rains and ſprings, and alſo as boundaries and barriers, and even as highways, and in many countries as plentiful ſtorehouſes. They alſo fertiliſe our foil by laying upon our warm fields the richeſt mould, brought from the high mountains, where it would have remained uſeleſs for want of genial heat.</p><p>Being ſuch intereſting objects of attention, every branch acquires a proper name, and the whole acquires a ſort of perſonal identity, of which it is frequently difficult to find the principle ; for the name of the great body of waters which diſcharges itſelf into the ſea is traced backwards to one of the ſources, while all the contributing ſtreams are loſt, although their waters form the chief part of the collection. And ſometimes the feeder in which the name is preſerved is ſmall-er than others which are united to the current, and which like a rich but ignoble alliance loſe their name in that of the more illuſtrious family. Some rivers indeed are reſpectable even at their birth, coming at once in force from ſome great lake. Such is the Rio de la Plata, the river St Laurence, and the mighty ſtreams which iſſue in all directions from the Baical lake. But, like the ſons of Adam, they are all of equal deſcent, and ſhould take their name from one of the feeders of theſe lakes. This is indeed the caſe with a few, ſuch as the Rhone, the Rhine, the Nile. Theſe, after having mixed their waters with thoſe of the lake, reſume their appearance and their name at its outſet.</p><p>But in general their origin and progreſs, and even the features of their character, bear ſome reſemblance (as has been prettily obſerved by Pliny) to the life of man. The river ſprings ſrom the earth ; but its origin is in heaven. Its beginnings are inſigniſicant, and its infancy is frivolous ; it plays among the flowers of a meadow ; it waters a garden, or turns a little mill. Gathering ſtrength in its youth, it becomes wild and impetuous. Impatient of the reſtraints which it ſtill meets with in the hollows among the mountains, it is reſtleſs and fretful ; quick in its turnings, and unſteady in its courfe. Now it is a roaring cataract, tearing up and overturning whatever oppoſes its progreſs, and it ſhoots headlong down from a rock ; then it becomes a ſullen and gloomy pool, buried in the bottom of a glin. Recovering breath by repoſe, ſt again daſhes along, till tired of the uproar and miſchief, ſt quits all that it has ſwept along, and leaves the opening of the valley ſtrewed with the rejected waſte. Now, quitting its retirement, it comes abroad into the world, journeying with more prudence and diforetion through cultivated fields, yielding to circumſtances, and winding round what would trouble it to overwhelm or remove. It paſſes through the populous cities and ail the buſy haunts of man, tendering its ſervices on every ſide, and becomes the ſupport and ornament of the country. Now increaſed by numerous alliances, and advanced</p></body></text></TEI>
