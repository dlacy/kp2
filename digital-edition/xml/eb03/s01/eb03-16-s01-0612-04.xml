the <hi rend="smallcaps">willow,</hi> in botany: A genus of the diandria order, belonging to the diœcia claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 50th order, <hi rend="italic">Amentaceae.</hi> The amentum of the male is ſcaly; there is no corolla; but a nectariferous glandule at the baſe of the flower. The female amentum is ſcaly; there is no corolla; the ſtyde bifid; the capſule unilocular and bivalved; the ſeeds pappous. The willow trees have been frequently the theme of poetical deſcription, both in ancient and modern times. In Virgil, Horace, and in Ovid, we have many exquiſite alluſions to them and their ſeveral properties; and for a melancholy lover or a contemplative poet, imagination cannot paint a fitter retreat than the banks of a beautiful river, and the ſhade of a drooping willow. There are 31 ſpecies; of which the moſt remarkable are, 1. The caprea, or common fallow-tree, grows to but a moderate height, having ſmooth, dark-green, brittle branches; oval, waved, rough leaves, indented at top, and woolly underneath. It grows abundantly in this country, but more frequently in dry than moiſt ſituations: it is of a brittle nature, ſo is unfit for the baſket-makers; but will ſerve for poles, ſtakes, and to lop for fire-wood; and its timber is good for many purpoſes. 2. The alba, white, or ſilver-leaved willow, grows to a great height and conſiderable bulk, having ſmooth pale-green ſhoots; long, ſpear-ſhaped, acuminated, ſawed, ſilvery-wſhite leaves, being downy on both ſides, with glands below the ſerratures. This is the common white willow, which grows abundantly about towns and villages, and by the ſides of rivers and brooks, &amp;c. 3. The vitellina, yellow or golden willow,<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0619.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0613"/>
grows but to a moderate height; having yellow, very pliant, ſhoots; oval, acute, ſerrated, very ſmooth leaves, with the ſerratures cartilaginous, and with callous punctures on the footſtalks. 4. The purpurea, purple, or red willow, grows to a large height, having long, reddiſh, very pliable ſhoots, and long ſpear-ſhaped, ſerrated, ſmooth leaves, the lower ones being oppoſite. 5. The viminalis, or oſier-willow, grows but a moderate height, having ſlender rod-like branches; very long, pliant, greeniſh ſhoots; and very long, narrow, ſpear- ſhaped, acute, almoſt entire leaves, hoary, and ſilky underneath. 6. The pentandria, pentandrous, broad-leaved, ſweet-ſcented willow, grows to ſome conſiderable ſtature, having browniih-green branches; oblong, broad, ſerrated, ſmooth, ſweet-ſcented leaves, ſhining above; and pentandrous flowers. 7. The triandria, or triandrous willow, grows to a large ſtature, having numerous, erect, greyiſh-green branches, and pliant ſhoots; oblong, acute-pointed, ſerrated ſmooth, ſhining- green leaves, eared at the baſe; and triandrous flowers. 8. The fragilis, fragile or crack-willow, riſes to a middling ſtature, with browniſh, very fragile, or brittle branches, long, oval lanceolate, ſawed, ſmooth leaves of a ſhining-green on both ſides, having dentated glandular foot-ſtalks. This fort in particular being exceedingly fragile, ſo that it eaſily cracks and breaks, is unfit for culture in oſier-grounds. 9. The Babylonica, Babylonian pendulous ſalix, commonly called w <hi rend="italic">eeρing willow,</hi> grows to a largiſh ſize, having numerous, long, ſlender, pendulous branches, hanging down looſely all round in a curious manner, and long, narrow, ſpear-ſhaped, ſerrated, ſmooth leaves. This curious willow is a native of the eaſt, and is retained in our hardy plantations for ornament, and exhibits a moſt agreeable variety; particularly when diſpoſed ſingly by the verges of any piece of water, or in ſpacious openings of graſs- ground.</p><p>All the ſpecies of ſalix are of the tree kind, very hardy, remarkably faſt growers, and ſeveral of them attaining a conſiderable ſtature when permitted to run up to ſtandards. They are moſtly of the aquatic tribe, being generally the moſt abundant and of moſt proſperous growth in watery ſituations: they however will grow freely almoſt anywhere, in any common foil and expoſure; but grow conſiderably the faſteſt and ſtrong- eſt in low moiſt land, particularly in marſhy ſituations, by the verges of rivers, brooks, and other waters; likewiſe along the ſides of watery ditches, &amp;c. which places often lying waſte, may be employed to good advantage, in plantations of willows, for different purpoſes.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
