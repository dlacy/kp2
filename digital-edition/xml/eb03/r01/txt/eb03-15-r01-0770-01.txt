R
, or
r
, a liquid confonant, being the 17th letter of our alphabet. Its found is formed by a guttural extrusion of the breath vibrated through the mouth, with a fort of quivering motion of the tongue drawn from the teeth, and canulated with the tip a little elevated towards the palate. In Greek words it is frequently aspirated with an
h
after it, as in
rhapsody, rhetoric, ice.
otherwise it is always followed by a vowel at the beginning of words and syllables.
In the notes of the ancients, R. or RO. signisies
Roma ;
R. C.
Romana civitas ;
R. G. C.
rei gerendœ caofa ;
R. F. E. D.
recte factum et dictum ;
R. G. F.
regis
silius;
R. P.
res publica,
or
Romani principes ;
and R. R. R. F. F. F.
res
Romana ruet ferro, fame, flamma.
Used as a numeral, R anciently stood for 80 ; and with a dash over it, thus R, for 80,000; but the Greek
r
, ῥ, with a small mark over it, signified 100; with the fame mark under it, it denoted 1000 × 100 ; thus ρ
signisied 100,000. In the Hebrew numeration ר denoted 200 : and with two horizontal points over it 1000 × 200 ; thus u = 200,000.
In the prescriptions of physicians, R or ℞ stands for
recipe, i. e.
"take.”
