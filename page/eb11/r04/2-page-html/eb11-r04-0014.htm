<p><span class="font1">It may safely be assumed that by custom at all events the children of a plebeian usually took his estate on his death intestate. But, as he was not a member of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">there was no provision for the devolution of his succession on failure of children. The want of them he&nbsp;could not supply by adrogation, as he had for long, it&nbsp;is thought, no access to the assembly of the curies; and&nbsp;it is doubtful if adoption of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiusfamilias</span><span class="font1"> was known before the&nbsp;XII. Tables. If therefore, as seems probable, the XII. Tables&nbsp;first introduced the succession of agnates, a plebeian unsurvived&nbsp;by children was necessarily heirless, that is to say, heirless in law.&nbsp;But custom seems to have looked without disfavour on the&nbsp;appropriation of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">heredium</span><span class="font1"> by an outsider: a brother or&nbsp;other near kinsman would naturally have the earliest opportunity, and, if he maintained his possession of it in the character&nbsp;of heir for a reasonable period, fixed by the XII. Tables at a&nbsp;year, the law dealt with him as heir, and in course of time the&nbsp;pontiffs imposed upon him the duty of maintaining the family&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sacra.</span><span class="font1"> This was probably the origin, and a very innocent&nbsp;and laudable one, of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">usttcapio pro herede,</span><span class="font1"> which Gaius&nbsp;condemns as an infamous institution, and which undoubtedly&nbsp;lost some of its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raison d’etre</span><span class="font1"> once the right of succession of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">agnates had been introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There is no trace of testamentary succession among the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">plebs</span><span class="font1"> prior to the Servian constitution, nor is it in the least&nbsp;degree likely that there was any such. Primitive&nbsp;communities are slow to realize the conception of&nbsp;private testaments, and the plebeians could not at&nbsp;this period make a public one either </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">calatis comitiis&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in procinctu.</span><span class="font1"> But not long after their admission&nbsp;to citizenship there is reason to conjecture that mancipation was employed by them, not indeed to make a testament&nbsp;instituting an heir and taking effect only on the testator’s death,&nbsp;but to make a conveyance of a whole patrimony </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The transaction took the form of an absolute acquisition, in&nbsp;exchange for a price (usually nominal), of the transferrer’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familia<sup>@@1</sup> </span><span class="font1">by a friend, technically called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae emptor,</span><span class="font1"> on&nbsp;trust to distribute, on the transferrer’s death and according&nbsp;to his instructions, whatever the transferee was not authorized&nbsp;to retain for himself. The transferrer may also have had power&nbsp;to reserve in the mancipation a usufruct of the estate while he&nbsp;lived.<sup>@@2</sup> Like so many other of the transactions of the early&nbsp;law, it was legally unprotected so far as the third parties were&nbsp;concerned whom the transferrer meant to benefit; they could&nbsp;only trust to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fides</span><span class="font1"> of the transferee. This </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">alienation, whatever the. date of its introduction, was the forerunner of the so-called testament </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per aes el libram,</span><span class="font1"> to be</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">afterwards described </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(infra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 543).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Contract and its Breach.—</span><span class="font1">To speak of a law of obligations </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">connexion </span><span class="font1">with the regal period, in the sense in which the&nbsp;words were understood in the later jurisprudence,&nbsp;would be a misapplication of language. It would&nbsp;be going too far to say, however, as is sometimes done,&nbsp;that before the time of Servius Rome had no conception&nbsp;of contract; for men must have bought and sold, or at least&nbsp;bartered, from earliest times—must have rented houses, hired&nbsp;labour, made loans, carried goods and been parties to a&nbsp;variety of other transactions inevitable amongst a people&nbsp;engaged to any extent in pastoral, agricultural or trading&nbsp;pursuits. It is true that a patrician family with a good&nbsp;establishment of clients and slaves had within itself ample&nbsp;machinery for supplying its ordinary wants, and was thus to&nbsp;a great extent independent of outside aid. But there were not&nbsp;many such families. There must therefore have been contracts&nbsp;and some customary rules to regulate them, though these were&nbsp;presumably very imperfect. In many cases, such as those&nbsp;alluded to, one of the parties at least must have trusted to the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">good faith of the other. What was his guarantee, and what remedy had he for breach of engagement?</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His reliance in the first place was on the probity of the party with whom he was dealing—on the latter’s reverence&nbsp;for Fides, and the dread he had of the disapprobation of his-fellows should he prove false, and of the penalties, social,&nbsp;religious or pecuniary, that might consequently be imposed&nbsp;on him by his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">gens</span><span class="font1"> in the case of a patrician, by his gild in&nbsp;the case of a craftsman, or by the king in the case of any other&nbsp;plebeian.<sup>@@3 </sup>If the party who had to rely on the other’s good&nbsp;faith was not satisfied with his promise and the grasp of the&nbsp;right hand that was its seal,<sup>@@4</sup> he might require his solemn&nbsp;oath </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(jusjurandum); </span><span class="font1">and it can hardly be doubted that,&nbsp;whatever may have been the case at a later period, in the&nbsp;time of the earlier kings he who forswore himself was amenable&nbsp;to pontifical discipline. If he preferred a more substantial&nbsp;guarantee, he took something in pledge or pawn from the&nbsp;other contractor; and, though he had no legal title to it, and&nbsp;so could not re'eover it by judicial process if he lost possession,&nbsp;yet so long as he retained it he had in his own hand a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">means of enforcing performance. Upon performance he could&nbsp;be forced to return it or suffer a penalty—not by reason of&nbsp;obligation resulting from a contract of pledge, for the law&nbsp;as yet recognized none, but because, in retaining it after the&nbsp;purpose was served for which he had received it, he was&nbsp;committing theft and liable to its punishment. At this stage&nbsp;breach of contract, as such, does not seem to have founded&nbsp;any action for damages or reparation before the tribunals;&nbsp;but it is not improbable that, where actual loss had been&nbsp;sustained, the injured party was permitted to resort immediately to self-redress by seizure of the wrong-doer or&nbsp;his goods. Self-help was according to the spirit of the time&nbsp;—not self-defence merely in presence of imminent danger,&nbsp;but active measures for redress of wrongs already completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There was one contract, however, notorious in after years under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nexum,</span><span class="font1"> that must have received legal sanction soon&nbsp;after the Servian reforms, though probably, like mancipation of property itself, known in practice earlier. In the&nbsp;XII. Tables it is apparently referred to as an existing&nbsp;institution. In its normal character it was a loan of money,&nbsp;or rather of the raw copper that as yet was all that stood,&nbsp;for money. How far in its original use it was accompanied by any&nbsp;formalities beyond the weighing of it in a pair of scales (which was&nbsp;rather substance than form) we know not; and what right it conferred on the creditor over his debtor who failed to repay can be&nbsp;only matter of speculation. Apparently the result of the Servian&nbsp;reforms was the regulating and ensuring the publicity of the contract and making the creditor's right of self-redress by apprehension </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(manus injectio)</span><span class="font1"> and imprisonment, &amp;c., of his debtor&nbsp;conditional on the observance of the prescribed formalities of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nexum.</span><span class="font1"> The character and effects, however, of this the earliest&nbsp;independent contract of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile,</span><span class="font1"> are much disputed and will&nbsp;be explained below on p. 545 seq.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Public and Private Offences and their Punishment.—</span><span class="font1">For anything like a clear line of demarcation between crimes&nbsp;and civil injuries we look in vain in regal Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Offences against the state itself, such as trafficking with an enemy for its overthrow </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(prodi tio)</span><span class="font1"> or treasonable practices at home </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(perduellio)</span><span class="font1"> were matter of&nbsp;state prosecution and punishment from the first. But in&nbsp;the case of those that primarily affected an individual or&nbsp;his estate there was a halting between, and to some extent&nbsp;a confusion of, the three systems of private vengeance, sacral</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1 </sup>The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familia,</span><span class="font1"> as the collective name for a man’s lands and man-cipable appurtenances, became itself capable of mancipation. The conveyance was universal.
