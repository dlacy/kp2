<p><span class="font3">RÙMÎ. Mohammed b. Mohammed b. Husaki albalkhi, better known as MaulAnA JalAhuddin Rιιmi, the greatest&nbsp;Suflc poet of Persia, was born on the 30th of September&nbsp;1207 (601 </span><span class="font0">A.H. </span><span class="font3">6th of Rabi' I.) at Balkh, in KhorasAn,&nbsp;where his family had resided from time immemorial, rich&nbsp;in property and public renown. He claimed descent from&nbsp;the caliph Abilbekr, and from the KhwArism shah SultAn&nbsp;'AlA-uddin b. Tukush (1199-1220), whose only daughter,&nbsp;Malika-i-JahAn, had been married to JalAhuddin’s grandfather. Her son, Mohammed, commonly called BahA-uddin Walad, was a famous doctor of Balkh, who, to escape&nbsp;the jealousy with which the sultan viewed his influence,&nbsp;emigrated to Asia Minor in 1212. Young JalAhuddin&nbsp;was only five years old at that time, but the signs of his&nbsp;future greatness in spiritual matters began already to manifest themselves in precocious knowledge and in ecstasies&nbsp;and visions. After residing for some time at Malatiyah&nbsp;and afterwards at ErzinjAn in Armenia, BahA-uddin was&nbsp;called to LArindah in Asia Minor, as principal of the local&nbsp;college, and there young JalAhuddin, who had meanwhile&nbsp;grown under the careful tuition of his father in wisdom and&nbsp;holiness, attained his maturity, and married in 1226 Jauhar&nbsp;KhAtiin, the daughter of LAlA Sharahuddin of Samarkand.&nbsp;Finally, BahA-uddin was invited to Iconium by 'AlA-uddin&nbsp;KaikubAd (1219-1236), the sultAn of Asia Minor, or, as it is&nbsp;commonly called in the East, Rιim,—whence JalAl-uddin’s&nbsp;surname </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(takhallus)</span><span class="font3"> Rιimi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">After BahA-uddin’s death in 1231, JalAhuddin went to Aleppo and Damascus for a short time to study, but, as&nbsp;the mere positive sciences in which he had been particularly trained failed to satisfy him, on his return to Iconium,&nbsp;where he became by and by professor of four separate&nbsp;colleges, he took for nine years as his spiritual guide&nbsp;Sayyid BurhAn-uddin Husaini of Tirmidh, one of his&nbsp;father’s disciples, and later on the wandering Süfi Shams-uddin of Tabriz, who arrived in Iconium on the 29th of&nbsp;November 1241, and soon acquired the most powerful&nbsp;influence over JalAhuddin, who even adopted his name&nbsp;as takhallus in his ghazals or mystic odes. Shams-uddin’s rather aggressive character, however, roused the&nbsp;indignation of the people of Iconium against him, and&nbsp;during a riot in which JalAl-uddin’s eldest son, 'AlA-uddin,&nbsp;was killed, he was arrested and probably executed ; at&nbsp;least he was no more seen. This fate of his teacher and&nbsp;friend, together with the untimely death of his son, threw&nbsp;JalAhuddin into deep melancholy, and in remembrance of&nbsp;these victims of popular wrath lie founded the order of&nbsp;the Maulawi or (in Turkish pronunciation) Mewlewi dervishes, famous for their piety as well as for their peculiar&nbsp;garb of mourning, their music and their mystic dance&nbsp;(samA), which is the outward representation of the circling&nbsp;movement of the spheres, and the inward symbol of the&nbsp;circling movement of the soul caused by the vibrations of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"><sup>@@@1</sup> Rmn Shrub</span><span class="font2"> is a kind of liqueur, or cold punch, the basis of which is rum, lemon juice, and sugar. It is prepared by adding to 34 gallons&nbsp;of proof rum 2 oz. of the essential oil of orange and an equal quantity&nbsp;of essential oil of lemon dissolved in one quart of spirit, and 300 Ib of&nbsp;refined sugar dissolved in 20 gallons of water. This combination is&nbsp;thoroughly mixed together, after which there is added sufficient orange&nbsp;juice or solution of tartaric acid to produce a slight pleasant acidity.&nbsp;After agitating the mixture again for some time, 20 gallons of water&nbsp;are added, bringing the quantity up to 100 gallons, and the agitation of&nbsp;the whole is continued for half an hour. In about a fortnight’s time&nbsp;the shrub should be brilliant and ready for bottling. Other flavouring&nbsp;ingredients are occasionally added, and the compound may be varied&nbsp;according to taste.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">a Siifi’s fervent love to God. The establishment of this order, which still possesses numerous cloisters throughout&nbsp;the Turkish empire, and the leadership of which has been&nbsp;kept in JalAl-uddin’s family in Iconium uninterruptedly for&nbsp;the last six hundred years, gave a new stimulus both to&nbsp;the zeal and energy and the poetical inspiration of the&nbsp;great shaikh. Most of his matchless odes, in which he&nbsp;soars on the wings of a genuine enthusiasm, high over&nbsp;earth and heaven up to the throne of Almighty God, were&nbsp;composed in honour of the Maulawi dervishes, and even his&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">opus magnum,</span><span class="font3"> the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Mathnawi</span><span class="font3"> or, as it is usually called, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Spiritual Mathnawi</span><span class="font3"> (mathnawi-i-ma'nawi), a production of&nbsp;the highest poetical and religious intuition in six books or&nbsp;daftars, with 30,000 to 40,000 double-rhymed verses, can&nbsp;be traced to the same source. The idea of this immense&nbsp;collection of ethical and moral precepts, interwoven with&nbsp;numerous anecdotes and comments on verses of the KorAn&nbsp;and sayings of the Prophet, which the Eastern world reveres&nbsp;as the greatest devotional work, the study of which secures&nbsp;eternal bliss, was first suggested to the poet by his favourite&nbsp;disciple Hasan, better known as HusAm-uddin, who became&nbsp;in 1258 JalAl-uddin’s chief assistant. He had frequently&nbsp;observed that the members of the Maulawi fraternity read&nbsp;with great delight the mystic mathnawis of SanA’i and&nbsp;Farid-uddiii 'AttAr, and induced his master to compose a&nbsp;similar poem on a larger scale. JalAhuddin readily fell in&nbsp;with this suggestion and dictated to him, with a short&nbsp;interruption, the whole work during the remaining years&nbsp;of bis life. Soon after the completion of this masterpiece&nbsp;JalAhuddin died on the 17th of December 1273 (672 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.</span><span class="font3">H.&nbsp;5th of JumAdA II.), worshipped as a saint by high and low.&nbsp;His first successor in the rectorship of the Maulawi&nbsp;fraternity was HusAm-uddin himself, after whose death in&nbsp;1284 JalAl-uddin’s younger and only surviving son, Shaikh&nbsp;BahAudd-in Ahmed, commonly called SultAn Walad, and&nbsp;favourably known as author of the mystical mathnawi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rabdbnama,</span><span class="font3"> or the Book of the Guitar (died 1312), was&nbsp;duly installed as grand-master of the order.</span></p>
