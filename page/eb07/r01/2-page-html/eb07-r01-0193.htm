<p><span class="font1">the season the weather usually is cloudy, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">doring-glass</span><span class="font1"> of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">day-net</span><span class="font1"> cannot act. The structure of this net is very simple, and is represented in fig. 11. The thread&nbsp;should be very fine, as also that used for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trammels;</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;meshes three quarters of an inch from knot to knot ; two&nbsp;pieces of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oblong</span><span class="font1"> netting, measuring three fathoms by one,&nbsp;are extended to their full width, by being lashed to light&nbsp;staves of the required length, one at each end (see fig. 11,&nbsp;A, A). These two leaves are to be laid on the ground exactly opposite each other, so accurately, that when they are&nbsp;drawn over, the two margins </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">m, m</span><span class="font1"> shall touch each other.&nbsp;Each leaf is to be staked down with pegs at the lower corners,&nbsp;at G, G, G, G. A line By and By is to be stretched from the&nbsp;top of the stakes B, B, and fastened firmly to the ground&nbsp;by the pegs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">g, g.</span><span class="font1"> Another line is to be stretched from the&nbsp;head of the stakes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font1"> in the direction of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bC, bC,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;fixed to the ground by a peg C and C. Another line F and&nbsp;F is to proceed from the head of each stake </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b, b,</span><span class="font1"> and is to&nbsp;be joined at H to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">main line,</span><span class="font1"> which draws the leaves&nbsp;over ; F, F should each be at least a fathom long. In the&nbsp;centre D is to be placed the doring-glass, whence proceeds&nbsp;a line E. The fowler retires to his ambuscade, and with&nbsp;his left hand he plays the doring-glass with the line E, and&nbsp;holds the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">main line</span><span class="font1"> H in his right ; when the birds are seen&nbsp;playing around the glass, and within reach of the net, he&nbsp;pulls the leaves over with a quick jerk, and thus secures&nbsp;them. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">doring-glass</span><span class="font1"> is thus made : Take a piece of&nbsp;wood (AC, fig. 12) nine inches long and one and a half&nbsp;thick, cut out in the shape of an arch, and the edges at the&nbsp;top bevelled off so as to make it a six-sided figure. This bow&nbsp;is to be painted red, and covered with pieces of looking-glass along the sides and at each end ; a wooden peg B, six&nbsp;inches long and three fourths of an inch in circumference,&nbsp;a little pointed at the end, with a hole at I, through which&nbsp;the line E (fig. 11) is threaded, must be fixed to the under&nbsp;surface of the arch, at the centre. Take another piece of&nbsp;wood six inches thick and one foot long (fig. 13), sharpened&nbsp;at the end in order to fix it in the ground ; cut out a mortise</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in it two inches high, and one inch and three fourths deep ; bore a hole at N and O, large enough to receive the peg&nbsp;B (fig. 12). This device is made to act by winding up the&nbsp;string round the peg several turns, and then pulling it ;&nbsp;then letting it wind itself up again, and then jerking it again ;&nbsp;thus making the glass revolve briskly, as children do their&nbsp;toy windmills.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The object we have had in view is that of embodying, in plain and simple language, a few practical hints on the&nbsp;subject of net-making, so that they may be conveniently&nbsp;consulted by all classes requiring that kind of information.&nbsp;The various engines described may be modified, altered,&nbsp;and combined, as occasion requires. It would be endless&nbsp;to enter into these minutiæ, or to give a catalogue of the&nbsp;different nets used, with the technical name for each </span><span class="font2">in </span><span class="font1">different parts of the kingdom. We shall therefore conclude&nbsp;with a few </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">general observations.</span><span class="font1"> 1. In all cases use twine as&nbsp;fine as circumstances will permit, and make your meshes as&nbsp;large as is consistent with the object in view ; for the nets&nbsp;will be thereby more easily dried, lighter, and more efficient.&nbsp;2. In filling your needle </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">double,</span><span class="font1"> draw the twine from </span><span class="font0">se</span><span class="font1">parate balls. 3. Take greatcare to dry your nets thoroughly,&nbsp;and hang them up away from walls, where rats and mice&nbsp;cannot get at them. 4. Mend them immediately. 5. Keep&nbsp;them well tanned, or immersed in Kyan’s Patent as often as&nbsp;may be necessary ; but never use tar and oil. This mixture&nbsp;has been proved to be inefficient as a preservative, and to&nbsp;be so offensive to the fish as to drive many away from the&nbsp;nets thus prepared, and to impart an unpleasant flavour to&nbsp;those that are caught in them. 6. If you wish to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dye</span><span class="font1"> your&nbsp;nets green, russet, yellow, &amp;c. for fowling or other purposes,&nbsp;send them to the nearest dyer or tanner, as the cheapest&nbsp;and best mode of treatment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b. k.)</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">RETICULUM is a Latin word, signifying a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">little net </span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">casting net.</span><span class="font1"> It was applied by the Romans to a particular mode of constructing their buildings. In the city of&nbsp;Salino may still be seen remains of some walls, evidently of&nbsp;Roman origin, from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reticulum.</span><span class="font1"> This structure consists of small pieces of baked earth, cut lozenge-wis e, and&nbsp;disposed with great regularity on the angles, so as to exhibit to the eye the appearance of cut diamonds; and it was&nbsp;called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reticular,</span><span class="font1"> from its resemblance to fishing-nets. The&nbsp;Romans always concealed it under a regular coating of other&nbsp;matter ; and Mr Houel informs us, that this was the only&nbsp;specimen of it which he saw in his travels through Sicily,&nbsp;Malta, and the Lapari Islands. It appears to be the remains of some baths, which had been built for the convenience of sea-bathing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RETIRADE, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fortification,</span><span class="font1"> a kind of retrenchment made in the body of a bastion or other work, which is to be&nbsp;disputed, inch by inch, after the defences are dismantled.&nbsp;It usually consists of two faces, which form a re-entering&nbsp;angle. When a breach is made in a bastion, the enemy&nbsp;may also make retirade or new fortification behind it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RETIREMENT means a private way of life, or a secret habitation. “ Few,” says an elegant writer, “ are able to&nbsp;bear solitude ; and though retirement is the ostensible object of the greater part, yet, when they are enabled by success to retire, they feel themselves unhappy. Peculiar powers&nbsp;and elegance of mind are necessary to enable us to draw all&nbsp;our resources from ourselves. In a remote and solitary village the mind must be internally active in a great degree,&nbsp;or it will be miserable for want of employment. But in&nbsp;great and populous cities, even while it is passive, it will be&nbsp;constantly amused. It is impossible to walk the streets&nbsp;without finding the attention powerfully solicited on every&nbsp;side. No exertion is necessary. Objects pour themselves&nbsp;into the senses, and it would be difficult to prevent their&nbsp;admittance. But, in retirement, there must be a spirit of&nbsp;philosophy and a store of learning, or else the fancied&nbsp;scenes of bliss will vanish like the colours of the rainbow.&nbsp;Poor Cowley might be said to be melancholy mad. He&nbsp;languished for solitude, and wished to hide himself in the&nbsp;wilds of America. But he was not able to support the solitude of a country village within a few miles of the metropolis. With a virtuous and cheerful family, with a few&nbsp;faithful and good-humoured friends, with a well-selected&nbsp;collection of elegant books, and with a competency, one&nbsp;may enjoy comforts even in the deserted village, which the&nbsp;city, with all its diversions, cannot supply.”</span></p>
