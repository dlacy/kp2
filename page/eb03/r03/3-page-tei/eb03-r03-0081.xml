To Jeruſalem he went, and having built a monaſtery on the Mount of Olives, he there aſſembled a great number of hermits, whom he animated to virtue by his exhortations. He converted many to the Chriſtian faith, and perſuaded more than 400 hermits who had taken part in the ſchiſm of Antioch to return to the church. He prevailed on many Macedonians and Arians to renounce their errors.</p><p>His attachment to the opinions of Origen ſet him at variance with St Jerome, who, being of a temper peculiarly irritable, not only retracted all the praiſes which he had laviſhed upon him, but loaded him with ſevere reproaches. Their diſputes, which were carried to a very indecent height, tended to injure Chriſtianity in the èyes of the weak. Theophilus, their mutual friend, fettled their differences ; but the reconciliation was of -ſhort continuance. Ruſinus having publiſhed a tranſlation of the principles of Origen at Rome, was ſum-ηιoned to appear before Pope Anaſtaſius. But he made a ſpecious apology for not appearing, and ſent a vindication of his work, in wſhich he attempted to prove that certain errors, of which Origen had been accuſed, were perfectly conſiſtent with the opinions of the orthodox. St Jerome attacked Ruſinus’s tranſlation. Rufi-nus compoſed an eloquent reply, in which lie declared •that he was only the tranſlator of Origen, and did not confider himſelf bound .to fonction all his errors. Moſt ©ccleſiaſtical hiſtorians ſay that Ruſinus was excommunicated by Pope Anaſtaſius ; but for this no good evidence has been brought. In 407, he returned to Rome ; but the year aſter, that city being threatened by Alaric,.he retired to Sicily, where he died in 410.</p><p>His works are, 1. À Tranſlation of Joſephus;</p><p>2.

Chromatius of Aquileia prevailed on him to undertake a Tranſlation of the Ec-cleſiaſtical Hiſtory of Euſebius, which engaged him almoſt ten years. He made many additions to the body of the work, and continued the hiſtory from the 2cth year of Conſtantine to the death of Theodoſius the Great. Many parts of this work are negligently written, many things are recorded as facts without any authority but common report, and many things of great importance are entirely omitted. 5.
