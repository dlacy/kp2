an iſland of the Archipelago, to the north of Candia, and to the ſouth-weſt of Nanphio. It is eight miles in length, and near as much in breadth, and almoſt covered with pumice-ſtone, whence the ſoil in general muſt be dry and barren; it is, however, greatly improved by the labour and in- duſtry of the inhabitants, who have turned it into a garden. It affords a great deal of barley, plenty of cotton, and large quantities of wine. Fruit is ſcarce except figs; and they have neither oil nor wood. The inhabitants are all Greeks, and are about 10,000 in number. Pyrgos is the capital town, and there are ſeveral little towns and villages. They have but one ſpring in the iſland, for which reaſon they preſerve the rain-water in ciſterns. Though ſubject to the Turks, they chooſe their own magiſtrates. E. Long. 25. 5. N. Lat. 39. 10.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
