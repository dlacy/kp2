(Byzantinus), an able grammarian, who lived in the 5th or 6th century. He wrote a Dictionary, in which he made a great number of obſervations, borrowed from mythology and hiſtory, which ſhowed the origin of cities and colonies, of which we have nothing remaining but a mean abridgment by Hermolaus the grammarian ; but from that work the learned have received great light ; and Sigonſhs, Caſaubon, Scaliger, Salmaſius, &amp;c. have employed themſelves in illuſtrating it.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
