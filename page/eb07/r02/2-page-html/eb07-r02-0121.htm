<p><span class="font2">failed to pay, and could neither himself give security, nor obtain any person to give it for him, he might be thrown into a dungeon, loaded with chains, and half starved for sixty&nbsp;days. If during that time he refused to come to any terms&nbsp;with his creditor, he might be again brought to the market&nbsp;place, and the amount of his debt stated, to see whether any&nbsp;person would yet become security for him. On the third&nbsp;day, if no friend appeared, he might be put to death, or sold&nbsp;for a slave beyond the Tiber; nay, if there were more creditors than one, they might actually hew his body in pieces,&nbsp;and divide it among them; and whether a creditor cut off&nbsp;a greater or smaller piece than in due proportion to the debt,&nbsp;he incurred no penalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In this manner vast numbers of the commonalty were reduced to the utmost wretchedness ; and instead of the influence which they had been promised by the Servian constitution, they were in a worse condition than the veriest slaves. The old Roman populus, the patricians and their&nbsp;clients, had engrossed all the wealth and power of the community, and formed the government into an exclusive aristocracy. Great numbers of the plebeians were </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">next,</span><span class="font2"> though not&nbsp;yet </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">addicti;</span><span class="font2"> and in this condition felt themselves trembling&nbsp;on the brink of utter ruin. Driven to despair by their distress, the commonsresolved that they would no longer endure&nbsp;their misery and degradation. Such of them as were in the&nbsp;city seized upon and began to fortify the Aventine hill, their&nbsp;own quarter ; those who were at the time in the field, deserted their generals, marched to a hill on the north bank&nbsp;of the Anio, beyond the limits of the Ager Romanus, and&nbsp;within that of the Crustuminian tribe. There they established themselves, and proposed to found a new city. The&nbsp;patricians, perceiving the ruin that must fall upon Rome if&nbsp;thus deserted by the great body of the commons, entered&nbsp;into négociations with them for a return. Their demands&nbsp;were not extravagant. They required a general cancelling&nbsp;of the obligations of insolvent debtors, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(nexi),</span><span class="font2"> and the release of those who in default of payment had been assigned&nbsp;to the power of their creditors, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(addicti).</span><span class="font2"> They further&nbsp;stipulated, that two of their own body should be acknowledged as their public protectors, and that the persons of&nbsp;these two should be held sacred and inviolable. To these&nbsp;terms the patricians agreed ; a solemn treaty was concluded ; the two protectors of the commons were chosen, and&nbsp;called Tribunes, and the commons returned to Rome. The&nbsp;spot where this treaty had been concluded was enclosed,&nbsp;and consecrated to Jupiter, and received the name of the&nbsp;Sacred Hill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This event was almost of equal importance with the expulsion of the kings and the abolition of the monarchical power. It laid the foundation of the liberties which the&nbsp;body of Roman citizens subsequently enjoyed ; and by giving them legal rights and legal protectors, converted into&nbsp;legal contests what might otherwise have rent the state&nbsp;asunder. But at the same time it gave to the tribunate,&nbsp;in the inviolability of the persons of those who held it,&nbsp;the means of acquiring an unlimited power in the state,&nbsp;such as might and did lead to ultimate despotism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The termination in an amicable manner of these feuds was greatly promoted by the fact, that the state was then&nbsp;at war with tbe Æqui and Volsci, two nations of Oscan race,&nbsp;whose lands lay south from Rome. It was no time for protracted civil broils when the country was ravaged, and the&nbsp;city itself threatened by such dangerous neighbours. To&nbsp;the same necessity may be traced the alliance with the Latin states, formed in the consulship of Spurius Cassius, on&nbsp;terms of perfect equality ; and seven years afterwards by the&nbsp;same Spurius Cassius, with the Hernicians, on similar terms.&nbsp;These leagues were of the utmost importance to Rome,&nbsp;both as restoring to her the power which she had lost after&nbsp;the expulsion of the kings, and that too on a more equitable&nbsp;and therefore more permanent basis, and in commencing&nbsp;that thoroughly incorporating and blending system which&nbsp;afterwards converted all the inhabitants of Italy into Roman&nbsp;citizens, and thus consolidating her growth, confirmed her&nbsp;power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A measure of equal justice, and not less importance, was also attempted by Spurius Cassius, the passing of which&nbsp;would have established the frame of Roman liberties on a&nbsp;secure foundation. This was an Agrarian law. The nature of the Agrarian laws, proposed from time to time at&nbsp;Rome, and always the cause of bitter contests between the&nbsp;patricians and plebeians, was never accurately known till it&nbsp;was explained by Niebuhr.@@<sup>1</sup> From him we learn, that when&nbsp;a new territory was gained in war, by the third being taken&nbsp;from the conquered people, part of it was left unenclosed for&nbsp;pasture, and the cultivated parts were either divided among&nbsp;the new citizens who had not previously received any allotment, or left to be occupied by certain individuals, who were&nbsp;required to pay a tithe of tlle produce to the state. The&nbsp;persons thus allowed to occupy these new acquisitions were&nbsp;generally members of powerful patrician families ; and,&nbsp;although tenants at will of the state, they were actual proprietors with respect to the other citizens. When a number&nbsp;of new citizens had been added to the state, it was consistent&nbsp;with the whole polity of Rome to allot them lands : but&nbsp;in order to do so it would be necessary for the state to resume its property from its tenants at will, and divide it&nbsp;among the new citizens ; for it was equally a matter of&nbsp;strict justice and sound policy to unite by permanent ties&nbsp;to the state those men </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">by </span><span class="font2">whose blood its victories were&nbsp;gained, and could alone be preserved. To this the occupiers would by no means consent; and thus the public land&nbsp;was wholly unprofitable to the commons, though they had&nbsp;been largely instrumental in conquering it for Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Agrarian law proposed by Spurius Cassius had for its object the division of a certain proportion of the public&nbsp;land ; while from the occupiers of the remainder he intended to demand the regular payment of the tithe, which had&nbsp;been greatly neglected. His colleague, Proculus Virginius,&nbsp;headed the more aristocratical party of the patrician body&nbsp;in opposing the passing of this law, kept it in abeyance, if&nbsp;not uncarried, till the termination of his consulship, and&nbsp;then accused him before the comitia curiata of having treasonably conspired to make himself king, and for that purpose seeking to ingratiate himself with the commons. He&nbsp;was sentenced to die as a traitor, and was scourged and beheaded, and his house razed to the ground. Such was the&nbsp;fate of the first proposer of an Agrarian law ; a topic equally&nbsp;detested by the Roman aristocracy, misinterpreted by the&nbsp;historians, and misunderstood by the moderns, yet a measure of strict justice and sound policy, and sufficiently intelligible when fairly stated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The contests between the patricians and the plebeians still continued; but the plebeians had now obtained the means&nbsp;of insuring ultimate success, though for a time defeated and&nbsp;overborne. They refused to serve as soldiers in the wars&nbsp;with which the state was still harassed, and their tribunes&nbsp;protected them in this refusal, till the consuls held their enrolment without the city, where their power was unlimited.&nbsp;At length the patricians consented that one of the consuls&nbsp;should be chosen by the plebeians in their centuries, the&nbsp;other by themselves, as usual, in their curiæ. This was a&nbsp;considerable advantage obtained by the plebeians; and they&nbsp;requited it by gaining a victory over the enemy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">For seven successive consulships the family of the Fabii had been elected, and had headed the patrician party. At&nbsp;length they resolved to conciliate the commons, and thereby incurred the hatred of their own order. Feeling them-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
