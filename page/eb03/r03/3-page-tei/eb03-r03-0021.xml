Moreover, ſince the greater obliquity cannot be produced without a greater ſtrain in the operation of twiſting, it follows, that immoderate twiſting is doubly prejudicial to the ſtrength of cordage.</p><p>Theſe theoretical deductions are abundantly confirmed by experiment ; and as many perſons give their aſ-ſent more readily to a general propofιtion when preſent-ed as an induction from unexceptionable particulars, than when offered as the conſequence of uncontroverted principles, we ſhall mention ſome of the experiments which have been made on this ſubject. Mr Reaumur, one of the moſt zealous, and at the ſame time judicious, obſervers of nature made the following experiments. <hi rend="italic">(Mem. Acad. Pans,</hi>  τ 7 I I. )</p><p>1.    A thread, conſiſting of 832 fibres of filk, each of which carried at a medium 1 dram and 18 grains, would hardly ſupport y⅛ pounds, and ſometimes broke with 5 pounds. The film of the abſolute ſtrengths of the fibres is 1040 drams, or upwards of 8 pounds 2 ounces.</p><p>2.    A ſkain of white thread was examined in many places. Every part of it bore q&lt; pounds, but none of it would bear 10. When twiſted ſlack into a cord of 2 yarns it broke with 16 pounds.</p><p>3.    Three threads were twiſted together. Their mean ſtrength was very nearly 8 pounds. It broke with 17⅜, whereas it ſhould have carried 24.</p><p>4.    Four threads were twiſted. Their mean ſtrength was 7I. Tt broke with 21 ſ inſtead of 30. Four threads, whoſe ſtrength was nearly 9 pounds, broke with 22 inſtead of 36.</p><p>5.    A ſmall and very well made hempen cord broke in different places with’58, 63, 67, 72 pounds. Another part of it was untwiſted into its three ſtrands. One of them bore 29⅜, another 33⅜, and the third 35; therefore the ſum of their abſolute ſtrengths was 98. In another part which broke with 72, the ſtrands which had already borne this ſtrain were ſeparated. They bore 26, 28, and 30; the ſum of which is 84.</p><p>The late admiral Sir Charles Knowles made many experiments on cordage of fize. A piece of rope .3J inches in circumference was cut into many portions. Each of theſe had a fathom cut off, and it was carefully opened out. It was white, or untarred, and containd 72 yarns. They were each tried ſeparately, and their mean ſtrength was 90 pounds. Each correſponding piece of rope was tried apart, and the mean ſtrength of the nine pieces was 4552 pounds. But 90 times 72 is 6480.</p><p>Nothing is more familiarly known to a ſeaman than the ſuperior ſtrength of rope-yarns made up into a ſkain without twiſting. They call ſuch a piece of rope a Salvage. It is uſed on board the king’s ſhips for rolling tackles, flinging the great guns, butt-flings, nippers for holding the viol on the cable, and in every</p><p>ſervice where the utmoſt ſtrength and great pliancy are wanted.</p><p>It is therefore fufficiently eſtabliſhed, both by theory and obſervation, that the twiſting of cordage diminiſhes its ſtrength. Experiments cannot be made with ſuſſi-cient precifion for determining whether this diminution is in the very proportion, relative to the obliquity of the fibres, which theory points out. In a hawſer the yarns lie in a great variety of angles with the axis. The very outermoſt yarn of a ſtrand is not much inclined to the axis of the rope : for the inclination of this yarn to the axis of its own ſtrand nearly compenſates for the inclination of the ſtrand. But then the oppoſite yarn of the ſame ſtrand, the yarn that is next the axis of the rope lies with an obliquity, which is the ſum of the obliquities of the ſtrand and of the yarn. So that all the yarns which are really in the axis of the rope are exceedingly oblique, and, in general, the infide of the rope has its yarns more oblique than the outlide. But in a laid rope we ſhould not conſider the ſtrength as made up of the ſtrengths of the yarns ; it is made up of the ſtrengths of the ſtrands : For when the rope is violently ſtretched, it untwiſts as a rope, and the ſtrands are a little more twiſted ; fo that they are refiſting as ſtrands, and not as yarns. Indeed, when we conſider the proceſs of laying the rope, we ſee that it muſt be ſo. We know, from what has been already ſaid, that the three ſtrands would carry more when parallel than when twiſted into a rope, although the yarns would then be much more oblique to the axis. The chief attention therefore ſhould be turned to the making the moſt perfect ſtrands.</p><p>We are fully authoriſed to ſay that the twiſt given to cordage ſhould be as moderate as poſſible. We are certain that it diminiſhes the ſtrength, and that the appearance of ſtrength which its ſuperior ſmoothneſs and hardneſs gives is ſallaeious. But a certain degree of this is neceſſary for its duration. If the rope is laid too ſlack, its parts are apt to open when it happens to be catched in ſhort loops at its going into a pulley, &amp;c. in which caſe ſome of the ſtrands or yarns are apt to kink and break. It alſo becomes too pervious to water, which ſoaks and rots it. To prevent theſe and other ſuch inconveniences, a conſiderable degree of ſirmneſs or hardneſs is neceſſary ; and in order to give the cordage this appearance of ſuperior ſtrength, the manufacturer is diſpoſed to exceed.</p><p>Mr Du Hamel made many experiments in the royal dock-yards in France, with a view to aſcertain λvhat is the beſt degree of twiſt. It is uſual to work up the yams to -∣∙ of their length. Mr Du Hamel thought this too much, and procured ſome to be worked up only to ⅜ of the length of the yarns. The ſtrength of the firſt, by a mean of three experiments, was 4321, and that of the laſt was 5187.</p><p>He cauſed three ropes to be made from the ſame hemp, ſpun with all poſſible equability, and in ſuch proportion of yarn that a fathom of each was of the ſame weight. The rope which was worked up to γ bore 4098 pounds ; that which was worked up to J bore 4850; and the one worked up to <hi rend="italic">y</hi>  bore 6205. In another trial the ſtrengths were 425<hi rend="sup">t</hi>0, 6753, and 7397. Theſe ropes were of different ſizes.</p><p>He had influence enough, in conſequence of theſe experiments, to get a conſiderable quantity of rigging</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
