<p><label>REEF</label>
a term in navigation. When there is a heavy gale of wind, the seamen commonly roll up part of the sail below, that by this means it may become the narrower, and not draw so much wind ; and this contracting or taking up the sail they call a <hi rend="italic">reef,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">reefing the sail.</hi> So also, when a <hi rend="italic">top-mast is sprung,</hi> as they call it, that is, when it is cracked, or almost broken in the cap, they cut off the lower piece that was nearly broken off, and setting the other part, now much shorter, in the step again, they call it a <hi rend="italic">reefed top-mast.</hi></p>
