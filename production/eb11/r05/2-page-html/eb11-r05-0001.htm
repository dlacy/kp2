<p><span class="font0">operations on a large scale, but on the contrary made it a principle to despise or neglect no feasible opportunity of transacting business, while at the same time his operations gradually extended to every quarter of the globe. He died on the&nbsp;28th of July 1836, and was succeeded in the management of the&nbsp;London house by his son Lionel (1808-1879), born on the 22nd&nbsp;of November 1808, whose name is associated with the removal&nbsp;of the civil disabilities of the Jews, He was elected a member for&nbsp;the City of London in 1847, and again in 1849 and 1852, but it&nbsp;was not till 1858 that the joint operation of an act of parliament&nbsp;and a resolution of the House of Commons, allowing the omission&nbsp;from the oath of the words to which as a Jew he conscientiously&nbsp;objected, rendered it possible for him to take his seat. He continued to represent the City of London till 1874. His eldest son,&nbsp;Nathan (b. 1840), was created a peer as Baron Rothschild in&nbsp;1885. Jacob (1792-1868), the youngest of the original brothers,&nbsp;was entrusted with the mission of starting the business in Paris&nbsp;after the restoration of the Bourbons, for whom he negotiated&nbsp;large loans. At the Revolution of 1848 he was a heavy loser, and&nbsp;had also to be protected for a time by a special guard. It was by&nbsp;his capital that the earliest railways were constructed in France;&nbsp;the profits he obtained from the speculation were very large.&nbsp;He died on the 15th of November 1868. The Naples branch&nbsp;was superintended by another of the brothers, Karl (1780-1855). It was always the least important of the five, and after&nbsp;the annexation of Naples to Italy in i860 it was discontinued.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROTHWELL, an urban district in the Normanton parliamentary division of the West Riding of Yorkshire, England, 4 m. S.E. of Leeds. Pop. (1901) 11,702. The church of the&nbsp;Holy Trinity, though largely restored, retains some good&nbsp;Decorated details. Rothwell soon after the Conquest was&nbsp;granted as a dependency of the castle of Pontefract to the&nbsp;Lacys, who erected here a baronial residence of which there are&nbsp;• slight remains. Coal and stone are obtained in the neighbourhood, and the town possesses match-works and rope and twine&nbsp;factories in which the majority of the large industrial population&nbsp;is employed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROTIFERA (or Rotatoria), a small, in many respects well-defined and somewhat isolated, class of the animal kingdom. Now familiarly known as “ wheel animalcules,” from the&nbsp;wheel-like motion produced by the rings of cilia which generally&nbsp;occur in the head region, the so-called rotatory organs, they&nbsp;were first discovered by A. Leeuwenhoek, to whom we also&nbsp;owe the discovery of Bacteria and ciliate Infusoria. Leeuwenhoek described </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rotifer vulgaris</span><span class="font0"> in 1702, and he subsequently&nbsp;described </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Melicerta ringens</span><span class="font0"> and other species. A great variety&nbsp;of forms were described by other observers, but they were not&nbsp;separated as a class from the unicellular organisms </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Protozoa)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">with which they usually occur, until the appearance of C. G.&nbsp;Ehrenberg’s monograph, which contained a 'mass of detail&nbsp;regarding their structure. At the present day few groups of&nbsp;the animal kingdom are so well known to the microscopist,&nbsp;few groups present more interesting affinities to the morphologist, and few multicellular animals such a low physiological&nbsp;condition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A rotifer may be regarded as typically a hemisphere or half an oblate spheroid or paraboloid with a mouth somewhere on the flat&nbsp;end (“ disk ” or “ corona ”), which bears a usually double ciliated&nbsp;ring, the outer zone the “cingulum,” and inner the “trochus”:&nbsp;this ring serves both for progression and for bringing up food. The&nbsp;body-wall, cuticulized outside, is formed by a single layer of ill-defined cells, and surrounds the simple body cavity (archicoele),&nbsp;traversed by simple or branched muscular fibres (“ mesenchyme ”)&nbsp;(fig. 1, wz,wi). The mouth opens through a narrow pharynx </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(p)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">into a chamber which is (as in Crustacea) at once crop and gizzard,&nbsp;the mastax (wa), whose thickenings are imbedded in the postero-ventral wall. A slender ciliated gullet </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(e)</span><span class="font0"> leads into a large stomach&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(st)</span><span class="font0"> whose wall consists of large richly ciliated cells with usually a&nbsp;pair of simple secretory sacs opening into it: it may open through&nbsp;an intestine or rectum into the cloaca. A pair of coiled nephridial&nbsp;tubes (n) formed of a file of perforated “ drain-pipe ” cells, with&nbsp;ciliated tag-like “ flame ” cells (/), open into a contractile bladder (W),</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which passes by a slender duct into the cloaca. Into this also opens the genital duct from the single or paired gonad </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ov).</span><span class="font0"> The simple&nbsp;nerve-ganglion or brain (g) lies on the anterodorsal side of the&nbsp;pharynx, and by its position determines the orientation of the&nbsp;animal, the cloacal openingjying on the same side, and the course of&nbsp;the gut being “ neural.” The sense organs are a pair of pigmented&nbsp;eyes (oc), ana two pairs of antennae, one anterior proximal and near&nbsp;the wreath, the other distal and usually more or less lateral. The&nbsp;sexes are always separate, the males being of very rare occurrence&nbsp;in most cases. In the female the gonad is complex as in flat worms,&nbsp;composed of a germary for the formation of the eggs, and a vitellary,&nbsp;much more conspicuous and alone figured </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ov),</span><span class="font0"> consisting of a definite&nbsp;number of large nucleated cells for the nourishment of the eggs.&nbsp;The apical end of the rotifer usually narrows suddenly beyond the&nbsp;curve of the gut and the cloacal aperture to form the foot of pseudopodium which ends in an organ of attachment, a pair of movable&nbsp;toes, each with the opening of a. cement-gland (g/) at its tip. Thus&nbsp;for orientation we place the rotifer like the cuttle-fish, head downwards: the ciliated disk is basal or oral, proximal to the rest of the&nbsp;animal, the foot is apical, and the brain and cloacal aperture are&nbsp;anterodorsal. It is in this position that free-swimming forms glide&nbsp;over the substratum of organic debris in which they find their food.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The cuticle may be locally or generally hardened, in the latter case being termed a lorica. Often the head is retractile, and a&nbsp;constriction of flexible cuticle distal to it is termed a neck: in&nbsp;Philodinaceae there are a series of thin flexible rings which permit&nbsp;both distal and proximal ends to.be telescoped into the middle; and&nbsp;in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Taphrocampa,</span><span class="font0"> regular constrictions of the whole bodywall give&nbsp;an appearance of metemeric segmentation to the body. In Philo-dinacea accessory toes are found, unfurnished with cement-glands&nbsp;and distinguished as spurs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Corona or Disk—</span><span class="font0">This typically consists of two concentric zones, the trochus and cingulum, often separated by a groove or gutter&nbsp;which may be finely ciliated; but in several genera of no close&nbsp;affinity, where it is very oblique to the longitudinal axis of the&nbsp;body, it is represented by a general ciliation of the surface </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Taphro-campa, Rattulus, Copeus, Adineta).</span><span class="font0"> We may suppose that primitively the mouth was seated in the centre of a funnel-shaped disk,&nbsp;surrounded by a double wreath. The nearest approach to this is&nbsp;found in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Microcodon</span><span class="font0"> (fig. 2, 1) and its allies, tne trochus being&nbsp;oval with two median gaps, the cingulum, more delicate, and complete. In Flosculariaceae the trochus is a horseshoe-shaped ridge</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
