            <p>SECEDERS CONTD contrary to the appointment of Jeſus Chriſt, and the practice of the apoſtles, when
                they filled up the firſt vacancy in the apoſtolic college, and appointed the
                election of deacons and elders in the primitive church.— Many of thoſe alſo who were
                thought to be the beſt friends of the church, expreſſed their fears that this act
                would have a tendency to overturn the eccleſiaſtical conſtitution which was
                eſtabliſhed at the Revolution.</p>
            <p>Mr Ebenezer Erſkine miniſter at Stirling diſtinguiſhed himſelf by a bold and
                determined oppoſition to the meaſures of the aſſembly in 1732. Being at that time
                moderator of the ſynod of Perth and Stirling, he opened the meeting at Perth with a
                ſermon from Pſalm cxviii. 22. “The ſtone which the builders rejected is become the
                head ſtone of the corner.” In the courſe of his ſermon he remonſtrated with no ſmall
                degree of freedom againſt the add of the preceding aſſembly with regard to the
                ſettlement of miniſters, and alleged that it was contrary to the word of God and the
                eſtabliſhed conſtitution of the church. A formal complaint was lodged againſt him
                for uttering ſeveral offenſive expreſſions in his ſermon before the ſynod. Many of
                the members declared that they heard him utter nothing but found and ſeaſonable
                doctrine; but his accuſers inſiſting on their complaint, obtained an appointment of
                a committee of ſynod to collect what were called the offenſive expreſſions, and to
                lay them before the next diet in writing. This was done accordingly; and Mr Erſkine
                gave in his anſwers to every article of the complaint. After three days warm
                reaſoning on this affair, the ſynod by a majority of ſix found him cenſurable;
                againſt which ſentence he proteſted, and appealed to the next general aſſembly. When
                the aſſembly met in May 1733, it affirmed the ſentence of the ſynod, and appointed
                Mr Erſkine to be rebuked and admoniſhed from the chair. Upon which he proteſted,
                that, as the aſſembly had found him cenſurable, and had rebuked him for doing what
                he conceived to be agreeable to the word of God and the ſtandards of the church, he
                ſhould be at liberty to preach the ſame truths, and to teſtify againſt the ſame or
                ſimilar evils, on every proper occaſion. To this proteſt Meſſrs William Wilſon
                miniſter at Perth, Alexander Moncrief miniſter at Abernethy, and James Fiſher
                miniſter at Kinclaven, gave in a written adherence, under the form of inſtrument;
                and theſe four withdrew, intending to return to their reſpective charges, and act
                agreeably to their proteſt whenever they ſhould have an opportunity. Had the affair
                reſted here, there never would have been a ſeceſſion; but the aſſembly reſolving to
                carry on the proceſs, cited them by their officer to compear next day. They obeyed
                the citation; and a committee was appointed to retire with them, in order to
                perſuade them to withdraw their proteſt. The committee having reported that they
                ſtill adhered to their proteſt, the aſſembly ordered them to appear before the
                commiſſion in Auguſt following and retract their proteſt; and if they ſhould not
                comply and teſtify their ſorrow for their conduct, the commiſſion was empowered to
                ſuſpend them from the exerciſe of their miniſtry, with certification that if they
                ſhould act contrary to ſaid ſentence, the commiſſion ſhould proceed to an higher
                cenſure.</p>
            <p>The commiſſion met in Auguſt accordingly; and the four miniſters ſtill adhering to
                their proteſt, were ſuſpended from the exerciſe of their office, and cited to the
                next meeting of the commiſſion in November following. From this ſentence ſeveral
                miniſters and elders, members of the commiſſion, diſſented. The commiſſion met in
                November, and the ſuſpended miniſters compeared. Addreſſes, repreſentations, and
                letters from ſeveral lynods and preſbyteries, relative to the buſineſs now before
                the commiſſion, were received and read. The ſynods of Dumfries, Murray, Roſs, Angus
                and Mearns, Perth and Stirling, craved that the commiſſion would delay proceeding to
                an higher cenſure. The ſynods of Galloway and File, as alſo the preſhytery of
                Dornoch, addreſſed the commiſſion for lenity, tenderneſs, and forbearance, towards
                the ſuſpended miniſters; and the preſhytery of Aberdeen repreſented, that, in their
                judgment, the ſentence of ſuſpenſion inflicted on the foreſaid miniſters was too
                high, and that it was a ſtretch of eccleſiaſtical authority. Many members of the
                commiſſion reaſoned in the ſame manner, and alleged that the act and ſentence of
                laſt aſſembly did not oblige them to proceed to an higher cenſure at this meeting of
                the commiſſion. The queſtion, however, was put, Proceed to an higher cenſure, or
                not? and the votes being numbered, were found equal on both ſides: upon which Mr
                John Goldie the moderator gave his caſting vote to proceed to an higher cenſure;
                which ſtands in their minutes in theſe words: “The commiſſion did and hereby do
                looſe the relation of Mr Ebenezer Erſkine miniſter at Stirling, Mr William Wilſon
                miniſter at Perth, Mr Alexander Moncrief miniſter at Abernethy, and Mr James Fiſher
                miniſter at Kinclaven, to their reſpective charges, and declare them no longer
                miniſters of this church; and do hereby prohibit all miniſters of this church to
                employ them, or any of them, in any miniſterial function. And the commiſſion do
                declare the churches of the ſaid miniſters vacant from and after the date of this
                ſentence.”</p>
            <p>This ſentence being intimated to them, they proteſted, that their miniſterial office
                and relation to their reſpective charges ſhould be held <hi rend="italic">as</hi>
                valid as if no ſuch ſentence had paſſed; and that they were now obliged to make a
                    <hi rend="italic">ſecession</hi> from the prevailing party in the eccleſiaſtical
                courts; and that it ſhall be lawful and warrantable for them to preach the goſpel,
                and diſcharge every branch of the paſtoral office, according to the word of God and
                the eſtabliſhed principles of the church of Scotland. Mr Ralph Erſkine miniſter at
                Dunfermline, Mr Thomas Mair miniſter at Orwel, Mr John M'Laren miniſter at
                Edinburgh, Mr John Currie miniſter at Kinglaſſie, Mr James Wardlaw miniſter at
                Dunfermline, and Mr Thomas Nairn miniſter at Abbotſhal, proteſted againſt the
                ſentence of the commiſſion, and that it ſhould be lawful for them to complain of it
                to any ſubſequent general aſſembly of the church.</p>
            <p>The ſeceſſion properly commenced at this date. And accordingly the ejected miniſters
                declared in their proteſt that they were laid under the diſagreeable neceſſity of
                ſeceding, not from the principles and conſtitution of the church of Scotland, to
                which, they ſaid, they ſtedfaſtly adhered, but from the preſent church-courts, which
                had thrown them out from miniſterial communion. The aſſembly, however, which met in
                May 1734 did ſo far modify the above ſentence, that they empowered the ſynod of
                Perth and Stirling to receive the ejected</p>
