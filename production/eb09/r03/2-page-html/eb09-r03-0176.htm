The largest, at Shandwick, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Clach-a-eharridh,</span><span class="font1"> or the “Stone of Lamentation,” was blown down in a&nbsp;storm in 1847 and broken into three pieces ; a smaller one at Nigg&nbsp;churchyard, struck down by the fall of the belfry in 1725, has been&nbsp;re-erected and fenced round ; and the third, which formerly stood&nbsp;at Cadboll of Hilltown has been removed for· preservation to the&nbsp;grounds of Invergordon Castle. An ancient vitrified fort, 420 feet&nbsp;by 120, crowns the Iiillof Knockfarrel in Fodderty parish. Among&nbsp;old castles are those of Lochslin, in the parish of Fearn, said to date&nbsp;from the 13th century, which, though very ruinous, still possesses tλvo square towers in good preservation ; Balone, in the&nbsp;parish of Tarbat, said to have been built by the earls of Ross ; and&nbsp;the remains of Dingwall Castle, the earls of Ross’s original seat.&nbsp;Of the abbey of Fearn, transferred from Edderton in 1338, and&nbsp;interesting as having had for its tenth abbot the Reformer Patrick&nbsp;Hamilton, the abbey church, much altered, is still used as the parish&nbsp;church. There are a very large number of fine modern mansions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSS, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir James Clark</span><span class="font2"> (1800-1862), arctic voyager, was born in London 15th April 1800. He entered the&nbsp;navy in 1812 under his uncle Sir John Ross (see below),&nbsp;whom he accompanied in his first voyage in search of a&nbsp;north-west passage. From 1819 to 1825, and again in&nbsp;1827, he was engaged with Captain Parry in his voyages.&nbsp;He served under his uncle from 1829 to 1833, discovering&nbsp;the position of the north magnetic pole on 1st June 1831&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Polar Regions,</span><span class="font2"> vol. xix. p. 320). He commanded&nbsp;the expedition in the “ Erebus ” and “ Terror ” to the&nbsp;Antarctic seas from 1839 to 1843, and after his return he&nbsp;received in 1844 the honour of knighthood. In 1847 he&nbsp;published </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A Narrative of a Voyage in the Antarctic Regions,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2 vols. His last expedition was in 1848 in the “Enterprise ” to Baffin’s Bay in search of Sir John Franklin. He died at Aylesbury, 3d April 1862.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSS, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sir John</span><span class="font2"> (1777-1856), arctic voyager, was the fourth son of the Rev. Andrew Ross, minister of Inch,&nbsp;Wigtonshire, where he was born in 1777. He entered the&nbsp;navy in 1786. In 1818 he sailed in command of an Arctic&nbsp;expedition (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Polar Regions,</span><span class="font2"> vol. xix. p. 319), an account&nbsp;of which he published, under the title </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Voyage of Discovery&nbsp;for the Purpose of Exploring Eaffirfs Bay,</span><span class="font2"> in 1819. In&nbsp;1829, through the munificence of his friend Sir Felix Booth,&nbsp;he was able to undertake a second expedition (see vol. xix.&nbsp;p. 320). Shortly after his return in 1833 he was knighted,&nbsp;made C.B., and elected a member of many learned societies.&nbsp;In accordance with a promise made to Sir John Franklin,&nbsp;he undertook a third expedition in 1850 and remained one&nbsp;winter on the ice, but accomplished nothing. His own&nbsp;account of the causes of his failure is given in a pamphlet&nbsp;published in 1855. He died 31st August 1856.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROSSANO, a city of Italy, in the province of Cosenza, most picturesquely situated on a precipitous spur of the&nbsp;great mountain mass of Sila (geologically the oldest part&nbsp;of Italy) overlooking the Gulf of Taranto. The railway&nbsp;station, 93 miles from Taranto, is about an hour from&nbsp;the town. Rossano is the seat of an archbishop and the&nbsp;centre of a circondario ; marble and alabaster quarries are&nbsp;worked in the neighbourhood ; and the inhabitants numbered 14,688 in 1881 (17,979 in the commune). In the&nbsp;cathedral is preserved the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Godex Rossanensis,</span><span class="font2"> an uncial&nbsp;MS. of the Gospels of Matthew and Mark (6th century)&nbsp;in silver characters on purple vellum, with twelve miniatures, of great interest in the history of Byzantine art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mentioned in the Itineraries, Rossano </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ORoscianum)</span><span class="font1"> appears under the Latin empire as one of the important fortresses of&nbsp;Calabria. Totila took it in 548. The people showed great attachment to the Byzantine empire, and the Greek rite was maintained&nbsp;in the cathedral till the time of the Angevins. In the 14th&nbsp;century Rossano was made a principality for the great family of&nbsp;De Baux. Passing to the Sforza, and thus to Sigismund of Poland,&nbsp;it was ultimately in 1558 united to the crown of Naples by Philip&nbsp;II. of Spain in virtue of a doubtful will by Bona of Poland in&nbsp;favour of Giovanni Lorenzo Pappacoda. Under Isabella of Aragon&nbsp;and Bona of Poland the town had been a centre of literary culture ;&nbsp;but under the Spaniards it rapidly declined even in the matter of&nbsp;population (2256 households in 1561, 1177 in 1669). The crown&nbsp;sold the lordship in 1612 to the Aldobrandini, and from them it&nbsp;passed to the Borghesi and the Caraffa. Rossano is best known&nbsp;as the birthplace of St Nilus the younger, whose life is the most&nbsp;valuable source of information extant in regard to the state of&nbsp;matters in southern Italy in the IOth century. Pope John VlL&nbsp;(705-707) was also a native of the town.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROSSE, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">William Parsons, third Earl of</span><span class="font2"> (1800-1867), the distinguished constructor of reflecting telescopes, was born at York on June 17, 1800, a son of the second&nbsp;earl, who as Sir Lawrence Parsons, Bart., had been a prominent member of the Irish Parliament. Until his father’s&nbsp;death (1841) he was known as Lord Oxmantown. He was&nbsp;M.P. for King’s County from 1821 to 1834, Irish representative peer from 1845, president of the Royal Society&nbsp;from 1848 to 1854, and chancellor of the university of&nbsp;Dublin from 1862. From 1827 he devoted himself to the&nbsp;improvement of reflecting telescopes; in 1839 he mounted&nbsp;a telescope of 3 feet aperture at his seat, Birr Castle,&nbsp;Parsonstown; andin 1845 his celebrated 6-foot reflector&nbsp;was finished. Owing to the famine and the disturbed&nbsp;state of the country, which demanded his attention as a&nbsp;large landowner and lieutenant of King’s County, the&nbsp;instrument remained unused for nearly three years, but&nbsp;since 1848 it has been in constant use, chiefly for observations of nebulæ, for which it was particularly suited on&nbsp;account of its immense optical power. Lord Rosse died&nbsp;on October 31, 1867.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first constructor of reflecting telescopes on a large scale, William Herschel, never published anything about his methods of&nbsp;casting and polishing specula, and he does not appear to have&nbsp;been very successful beyond specula of 18 inches diameter, his 4-foot speculum (“the 40-foot telescope”) having been very little&nbsp;used by him (about this question see an interesting discussion&nbsp;between Sir J. Herschel and Robinson in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Athevxeurn,</span><span class="font1"> Nos.&nbsp;831-36, 1843, which deserves to be rescued from, oblivion). Lord&nbsp;Rosse had therefore no help whatever in working his way from a&nbsp;small beginning to the brilliant results he achieved. Hisspeculum&nbsp;metal is composed of four equivalents of copper and one of tin, a&nbsp;very brilliant alloy, which resists tarnish better than any other&nbsp;compound tried. Chiefly owing to the extreme brittleness of this&nbsp;material, Lord Rosse’s first larger specula were composed of a&nbsp;number of thin plates of speculum metal (sixteen for a 3-foot mirror)&nbsp;soldered on the back of a strong but light framework made of a&nbsp;peculiar kind of brass (2<sup>-</sup>75 of copper to 1 of zinc), which has the&nbsp;same expansion as his speculum metal. In Brewster’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Edinburgh&nbsp;Journal of Science</span><span class="font1"> for 1828 he described his machine for polishing&nbsp;the speculum, which in all essential points remained unaltered&nbsp;afterwards. It imitates the motions made in polishing a speculum&nbsp;by hand by giving both a rectilinear and a lateral motion to the&nbsp;polisher, while the speculum revolves slowly ; by shifting two&nbsp;eccentric pins the course of the polisher can be varied at will from&nbsp;a straight line to an ellipse of very small eccentricity, and a true&nbsp;parabolic figure can thus be obtained. The speculum lies face&nbsp;upwards in a shallow bath of water (to preserve a uniform temperature), and the polisher fits loosely in a ring, so that the rotation&nbsp;of the speculum makes it revolve also, but more slowly. Both the&nbsp;grinding and polishing tools are grooved, to obtain a uniform distribution of the emery used in the grinding process and of the&nbsp;rouge employed in polishing, as also to provide for the lateral&nbsp;expansion of the pitch with which the polisher is coated. In&nbsp;September 1839 a 3-foot speculum was finished and mounted on an&nbsp;altazimuth stand similar to HerscheFs ; but, though the definition&nbsp;of the images was good (except that the diffraction at the joints of&nbsp;the speculum caused minute rays in the case of a very bright star),&nbsp;and its peculiar skeleton form allowed the speculum to follow&nbsp;atmospheric changes of temperature very quickly, Lord Rosse&nbsp;decided to cast a solid 3-foot speculum. Hitherto it had been&nbsp;felt as a great difficulty in casting specula that the solidification&nbsp;did not begin at one surface and proceed gradually to the other,&nbsp;the common sand mould allowing the edges to cool first, so that&nbsp;the central parts were subject to great straining when their time of&nbsp;cooling came, and in large castings this generally caused cracking.&nbsp;By forming the bottom of the mould of hoop iron placed on edge&nbsp;and closely packed, and the sides of sand, while the top was left&nbsp;open, Lord Rosse overcame this difficulty, and the hoop iron had&nbsp;the further advantage of allowing the gas developed dufing the&nbsp;cooling to escape, thus preventing the speculum from being full of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
