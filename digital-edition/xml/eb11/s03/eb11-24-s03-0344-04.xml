S.E. from Zwickau by rail. Pop. (1905) 9034. It contains a handsome Gothic parish church, one of the largest ecclesiastical buildings in Saxony, dedicated to St Wolfgang, with an altar-piece by Lucas Cranach the elder, and numerous tombs; a gymnasium; a school of lace-making and a hospital. Hand-made lace and silver mining, formerly its two most important industries, have greatly declined. The first has been almost entirely superseded by machine-made goods, while the second appears to have languished owing to exhaustion of the mines. Cobalt, bismuth and nickel are worked and yield satisfactory results, and machine-made lace, em-broidery, porcelain, corsets, shoes and colours are among the chief of its other industrial products. Schneeberg is also noted for a snuff made of aromatic herbs, which commands a ready sale in the district.</p><p>See Lehmann, <hi rend="italic">Chronik von Schneeberg</hi> (Schneeberg, 1837-1840).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
