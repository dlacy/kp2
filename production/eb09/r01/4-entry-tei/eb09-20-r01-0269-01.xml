               <p>                   <label>RAMUS</label>, Peter, or <hi rend="smallcaps">Pierre de la Ramee</hi>
                    (1515-1572), logician, was born at the village of Cuth in Picardy in the year
                    1515. He was descended from a noble family, which had fallen, however, into such
                    poverty that his father earned his livelihood as a field-labourer. The early
                    death of his father increased Ramus’s difficulties in obtaining the education
                    for which he thirsted. But at last his perseverance was rewarded by admission,
                    in a menial capacity, to the college of Navarre. He worked with his hands by day
                    and carried on his studies at night. The reaction against scholasticism was
                    still in full tide; it was the transition time between the old and the new, when
                    the eager and forward-looking spirits had first of all to do battle with
                    scholastic Aristotelianism. In the domain of logic men like Laurentius Valla,
                    Rudolphus Agricola, and Ludovicus Vives, imbued with the spirit of the
                    Renaissance, had already invoked Cicero against the barbarous Latinity of the
                    scholastic compends; and, following the same prototype, they had proposed
                    various innovations which tended to assimilate logic to rhetoric. Ramus outdid
                    his predecessors in the impetuosity of his revolt. He signalized himself on the
                    occasion of taking his degree</p>                <p>(1536) by victoriously defending the daring thesis—Everything that Aristotle
                    taught is false. This <hi rend="italic">tour de force</hi> was followed up by
                    the publication in 1543 of <hi rend="italic">Aristotélica Animadversiones</hi>
                    and <hi rend="italic">Dialecticæ Partitiones,</hi> the former a criticism on the
                    old logic and the latter a new text-book of the science. What are substantially
                    fresh editions of the <hi rend="italic">Partitiones</hi> appeared in 1547 as <hi
                        rend="italic">Institutiones Dialecticæ,</hi> and in 1548 as <hi
                        rend="italic">Scholæ Dialecticæ·,</hi> his <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dialectique,</hi> a French version of his system, is the earliest work on
                    the subject in the French language. Meanwhile Ramus, as graduate of the
                    university, had opened courses of lectures ; but his audacities drew upon him
                    the determined hostility of the conservative party in philosophy and theology.
                    He was accused of undermining the foundations of philosophy and religion, and
                    the matter was brought before the parlement of Paris, and finally before the
                    king. By him it was referred to a commission of five, who found Ramus guilty of
                    having “acted rashly, arrogantly, and impudently,” and interdicted his lectures
                    (1544). He withdrew from Paris, but soon afterwards returned, the decree against
                    him being cancelled through the influence of the cardinal of Lorraine. In 1551
                    Henry II. appointed him professor of philosophy and eloquence at the Collège de
                    France, where for a considerable time he enjoyed free scope for his energies.
                    His incessant literary activity is proved by the fifty works which he published
                    in his lifetime, to which must be added nine that appeared after his death. In
                    1561, however, the slumbering enmity against Ramus was suddenly fanned into
                    flame by his adoption of Protestantism. He had to flee from Paris for his life ;
                    and, though he found an asylum in the palace of Fontainebleau, his house was
                    pillaged and his library burned in his absence. He resumed his chair after this
                    for a time, but in 1568 the position of affairs was again so threatening that he
                    found it advisable to ask permission to travel. He travelled mainly in
                    Switzerland and Germany, residing some time in Basel, Heidelberg, Geneva, and
                    Lausanne, and meeting everywhere with the most flattering reception. Returning
                    to France, Ramus at last fell a victim to the inveterate hate of his opponents :
                    he perished by the hands of hired assassins in the massacre of St Bartholomew
                    (1572).</p>                <p>The logic of Ramus enjoyed a great celebrity for a time, and there existed a
                    school of Ramists boasting numerous adherents in France, Germany, and Holland.
                    As late as 1626 Burgersdyck divides the logicians of his day into the
                    Aristotelians, the Ramists, and the Semi-Ramists, who endeavoured, like
                    Goclenius of Marburg, to mediate between the contending parties. Ramus’s works
                    appear among the logical text-books of the Scottish universities, and he was not
                    without his followers in England in the 17th century. There is even a little
                    treatise from the hand of Milton, published two years before his death, called
                        <hi rend="italic">Artis Logicæ Plenior Institutio ad Petri Rami Methodum
                        concinnata.</hi> It cannot be said, however, that Ramus’s innovations mark
                    any epoch in the history of logic ; and, though some of his additions have
                    maintained their ground, he has made no contribution of fundamental importance
                    to the science. His rhetorical leaning is seen in the definition of logic as the
                    “ ars disserendi ” ; he maintains that the rules of logic may be better learned
                    from observation of the way in which Cicero persuaded his hearers than from a
                    study of the <hi rend="italic">Organon.</hi> The distinction between natural and
                    artificial logic, <hi rend="italic">i.e.,</hi> between the implicit logic of
                    daily speech and the same logic made explicit in a system, passed over into the
                    logical handbooks. Logic falls, according to Ramus, into two parts—invention
                    (treating of the notion and definition) and judgment (comprising the judgment
                    proper, syllogism, and method). This division gave rise to the jocular
                    designation of judgment or mother-wit as the “ secunda Petri. ” He is, perhaps,
                    most suggestive in his emendations of the syllogism. He admits only the first
                    three figures, as in the original Aristotelian scheme, and in his later works he
                    also attacks the validity of the third figure, following in this the precedent
                    of Laurentius Valla. Ramus also set the modern fashion of deducing the figures
                    from the position of the middle term in the premises, instead of basing them, as
                    Aristotle does, upon the different relation of the middle to the so-called major
                    and minor term. On the whole, however, though Ramus may be allowed to have
                    advanced logical study by the wholesome fermentation of thought which he caused,
                    we are</p>                <pb xml:id="eb09-20-r01-0269" facs="encyclopediabrit20newyrich_raw_0287.jp2"/>
                <p>at a loss to see the grounds for his pretentious claim to supersede Aristotle by
                    a new and independent system.</p>                <p>See Waddington-Kastus, <hi rend="italic">De Petri Rami vita, scriptis,
