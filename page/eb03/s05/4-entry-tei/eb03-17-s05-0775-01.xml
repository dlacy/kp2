Of this genus there are ſeveral ſpecies, for which ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Mineralogy.</hi> According to the analyſis of Bergman, 100 parts of ſteatites contain 80 of ſilex, 17 of mild magneſ a, 2 of argillaceous earth, and nearly 1 of iron in a ſemioxidated ſtate.</p><p>This ſubſtance may be formed into a paſte with water, sufficiently ductile to be worked on the potter’s wheel ; and by expoſure to a great heat it is hardened ſo as to ſtrike fire with ſteel. It has alſo the property of <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> FulLER'S</hi> <hi rend="italic">Earth</hi> in cleanſing cloths from greaſe : but it does not diffuſe in water ſo well as clays do ; and when digeſted with vitriolic acid, it does not form alum, as clays do, but a ſalt ſimilar to Epſom ſalt. From its ſoftneſs and ductility it may be eaſily formed into pots for the kitchen ; and hence it has got the name of <hi rend="italic">lapis οllaris.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
