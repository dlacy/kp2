The animal is an aſcidia. The ſhell is bivalve, oblong, and opening at both ſides: the hinge has a tooth ſhaped like an awl, bent back, often double, not inserted into the oppoſite shell ; the rim at the ſides ſomewhat worn away, and has a horny cartilaginous hinge. There are 23 ſpecies. Three of them, viz. the siliqua, vagina, and enſis, are found on the Britiſh coaſts, and lurk in the sand near the low-water mark in a perpendicular direction. When in want of food they elevate one end a little above the ſurface, and protrude their bodies far out of the ſhell. On the approach of danger they dart deep into the sand, ſometimes two feet at leaſt. Their place is known by a ſmall dimple on the ſurface. Sometimes they are dug out with a ſhovel ; at other times they are taken by ſtriking a barbed dart ſuddenly into them. When the ſea is down, theſe fiſh uſually run deep into the sand ; and to bring them up; the common cuſtom is to throw a little ſalt into the holes, on which the fiſh raiſes itſelf, and in a few minutes appears at the mouth of its hole. When half the ſhell is diſcovered, the fiſherman has nothing more to do than to take hold of it with his fingers and draw it out : but he muſt be cautious not to loſe the occaſion, for the creature does not continue a moment in that ſtate ; and if by any means the fiſherman has touched it, and let it slip away, it is gone for ever ; for it will not be decoyed again out of its hole by ſalt ; ſo that there is then no way of getting it but by digging under it, and throwing it up with the sand. The fiſh has two pipes, each compoſed of four or five rings or portions of a hollow cylinder, of unequal lengths, joined one to another ; and the places where they join are marked by a number of fine ſtreaks or rays. Now the reaſon why the ſalt makes theſe creatures come up out of their holes, is, that it gives them violent pain, and even corrodes theſe pipes. This is ſomewhat ſtrange,</p><p>as the creature is nourished by means of ſalt-water; but it is very evident, that if a little ſalt be ſtrewed upon theſe pipes in a fiſh taken out of ſts habitation, it will corrode the joinings of the rings, and often make one or more joints drop off: the creature, to avoid this miſchief, ariſes out of its hole, and throws off the ſalt, and then retires back again. The uſe of theſe pipes to the animal is the ſame with that of many other pipes of a like kind in other ſhell-fifh ; they all ſerve to take in water : they are only a continuation of the outer membrane of the fiſh, and ſerve indifferently for taking in and throwing out the water, one receiving, and the other diſcharging it, and either anſwering equally well to their purpoſe. See Animal Motion.</p><p>This fiſh was uſed as food by the ancients; and Athenæus, from Sophron, ſpeaks of it as a great delicacy, and particularly grateful to widows. It is often uſed as food at preſent, and is brought up to table fried in eggs.</p><p>SOLEURE, a canton oſ Swiſſerland, which holds the 11th rank in the Helvetic confederacy, into which it was admitted in the year 1481. It ſtretches partly through the plain, and partly along the chains of the Jura, and contains about 50,000 inhabitants. It is 35 miles in length from north to south, and 35 in breadth from eaſt to west. The soil for the moſt part is exceedingly fertile in corn ; and the diſtricts within the Jura abound in excellent paſtures. The trade both of the town and canton is of little value, although they are very commodiouſly ſituated for an extenſive commerce; It is divided into 11 bailiwicks, the inhabitants of which are all Roman Catholics except thoſe of the bailiwick of Buckegberg, who profeſs the reformed religion. The sovereign power reſides in the great council, which, compriſing the ſenate or little council of 36, conſiſts of 102 members, choſen by the ſenate in equal proportions from the 11 tribes or companies into which the ancient burghers are diſtributed ; and, owing to the diſtinction between the ancient and the new burghers (the former conſiſting of only 85 families) the government is a complete ariſtocracy.</p><p>Soleure, an ancient and extremely neat town of Swiſſerland, capital of the canton of the ſame name. It contains about 4000 inhabitants, and is pleaſantly ſeated on the Aar, which here expands into a noble river; Among the moſt remarkable objects of curioſity in this town is the new church of St Urs, which was begun in 1762 and finiſhed in 1772. It is a noble edifice of a whitiſh grey ſtone, drawn from the neighbouring quarries, which admits a poliſh, and is a ſpecies of rude marble. The lower part of the building is of the Corinthian, the upper of the Compoſite order. The facade, which conſiſts of a portico, ſurmounted by an elegant tower, preſents itſelf finely at the extremity of the principal ſtreet. It coſt at leaſt L. 80,000, a conſiderable ſum for ſuch a ſmall republic, whoſe revenue ſcarcely exceeds L. 12,000 a year. Soleure is ſurrounded by regular ſtone fortifications, and is 20 miles north north- eaſt of Bern, 27 south ſouth-weſt of Baſle, and 45 weſt of Zurich. E. Long. 7. 20. N.
