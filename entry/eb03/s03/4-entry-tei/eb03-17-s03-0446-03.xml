 in antiquity, was frequently uſed on eccleſiaſtical, civil, and military occaſions, as a ſign of approbation, and ſometimes of indignation.—Thus as Cicero, in an aſſembly of the people, was expoſing the arrogance of L. Antony, who had had the impudence to cauſe himſelf to be inſcribed the patron of the Romans, the people on hearing this raised a ſhout to ſhow their indignation. In the ancient military diſcipline, ſhouts were uſed, 1. Upon occasion of the general’s making a ſpeech or harangue to the army from his tribunal. This they did in token of their approving what had been propoſed. 2. Before an engagement, in order to encourage and ſpirit their own men, and fill the enemy with dread. This is a practice of great antiquity ; beſides which, it wants not the authority of reaſon to ſupport it ; for as mankind are endowed with two ſenſes, hearing and seeing, by which fear is raised in the mind, it may be proper to make uſe of the ear as well as the eye for that purpoſe. Shouts were alſo raised in the ancient theatre, when what was acted pleaſed the ſpectators. It was uſual for thoſe preſent at the burning of the dead to raiſe a great ſhout, and call the dead perſon by his name before they ſet fire to the pile.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
