<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Section</span><span class="font0"> II.—</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">History of the Roman Republic in the Middle Ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The history of the Roman republic during the Middle Ages has yet to be written, and only by the discovery of&nbsp;new documents can the difficulties of the task be completely overcome. Although very different in its origin,&nbsp;the Roman republic gradually assumed the same form as the&nbsp;other Italian communes, and with almost identical institutions. But, owing to the special local conditions amid&nbsp;which it arose, it maintained a distinct physiognomy and&nbsp;character. The deserted Campagna surrounding the city&nbsp;checked any notable increase of trade or industry, and&nbsp;prevented the establishment of the guilds on the solid&nbsp;footing that elsewhere made them the basis and support&nbsp;of the commune. There was also the continual and&nbsp;oppressive influence of the empire, and, above all, the&nbsp;presence of the papacy, which often appeared to absorb&nbsp;the entire vitality of the city. At such moments the&nbsp;commune seemed annihilated, but it speedily revived&nbsp;and reasserted itself. Consequently there are many&nbsp;apparent gaps in its history, and we have often extreme&nbsp;difficulty in discovering the invisible links connecting the&nbsp;visible fragments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Even the aristocracy of Rome had a special stamp. In the other republics, excepting Venice, it was feudal, of&nbsp;German origin, and in perpetual conflict with the popular&nbsp;and commercial elements which sought its destruction.&nbsp;The history of municipal freedom lay in this struggle.&nbsp;But the infiltration of Teutonic and feudal elements broke&nbsp;up the ancient aristocracy of Rome, and left it at the&nbsp;mercy of the people. Then the popes, by the bestow<sup>τ</sup>al of&nbsp;lucrative posts, rich benefices, and vast estates, and, above&nbsp;all, by raising many nobles to the purple, introduced new&nbsp;blood into the Roman aristocracy, and endued it with&nbsp;increasing strength and vitality. Always divided, always&nbsp;turbulent, this irrepressible body was a continual source of&nbsp;discord and civil war, of permanent confusion and turmoil.&nbsp;Amidst all these difficulties the commune struggled on,&nbsp;but never succeeded in long preserving a regular course&nbsp;or administration. What with continual warfare, attacks&nbsp;on the Capitol, and consequent slaughter, pillage, and incendiarism, it is no wonder that so few original documents&nbsp;are left to illustrate the history of the Roman republic.&nbsp;Nor have chroniclers and historians done much to supply&nbsp;this want, since, in treating of Roman affairs, their attention is mainly devoted to the pope and the emperor.&nbsp;Nevertheless we will attempt to connect in due order all&nbsp;the facts gleaned from former writers and published records.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The removal of the seat of the empire to Constantinople effected a radical change in the political situation of&nbsp;Rome ; nor was this change neutralized by the formation&nbsp;of the weak Western empire soon to be shattered by the&nbsp;Germanic invasions. But we still find Roman laws and&nbsp;institutions ; and no sign is yet manifest of the rise of a&nbsp;mediæval municipality. The earliest germ of one is seen&nbsp;during the barbarian invasions. Of these we need only&nbsp;enumerate the four most important,—those of the Goths,&nbsp;Byzantines, Lombards, and Franks. The Gothic rule&nbsp;merely superposed upon the Roman social order a Teutonic&nbsp;stratum, that never penetrated beneath its surface. The&nbsp;Goths always remained a conquering army ; according to&nbsp;the German custom, they took possession of one third of&nbsp;the vanquished territory, but, while forbidding the Romans&nbsp;to bear arms, left their local administration intact. The&nbsp;senate, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">curiae,</span><span class="font1"> the principal magistrates, both provincial and municipal, the prefect of the city, and the Roman&nbsp;judges enforcing the enactments of the Roman law were&nbsp;all preserved. Already, under the empire, the civil power&nbsp;had been separated from the military, and this separation&nbsp;was maintained. Hence there was no visible change in&nbsp;the constitution of the state. Only, now there were conquered and conquerors. All real and effective power was&nbsp;on the side of brute force, and the Goths alone bore arms.&nbsp;In every province they had their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">comites,</span><span class="font1"> or heads of the&nbsp;army, who had judicial power over their countrymen,&nbsp;especially in criminal cases. Here then was a combination of civil and military jurisdiction altogether contrary&nbsp;to the Roman idea. Nor can it be denied that the comités,&nbsp;as chiefs of the armed force, necessarily exerted a direct&nbsp;or indirect influence on the civil and administrative power&nbsp;of the provinces, and especially upon the collection of the&nbsp;imposts. The civil arm, being virtually subordinate to the&nbsp;military, suffered unavoidable change. Notwithstanding&nbsp;the praise lavished on Theodoric, the kingdom founded&nbsp;by him in Italy had no solid basis. It was composed of&nbsp;two nations differing in race and traditions and even in&nbsp;religion, since the Goths were Arians and the Romans&nbsp;Catholics. The latter were sunk in degeneracy and corruption ; their institutions were old and decrepit. It was&nbsp;necessary to infuse new life into the worn-out body. This&nbsp;was difficult, perhaps impossible ; and at any rate Theodoric&nbsp;never attempted the task. Little wonder then if the&nbsp;Gothic kingdom succumbed to the Byzantine hordes from&nbsp;Constantinople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The wars of Belisarius and Narses against the Goths lasted twenty years (535-555 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.),</span><span class="font1"> Causedterribleslaughter&nbsp;and devastation in Italy, and finally subjected her to&nbsp;Constantinople. In place of a Gothic king she was now&nbsp;ruled by a Greek patrician, afterwards entitled the exarch,&nbsp;who had his seat of government at Ravenna as lieutenant&nbsp;of the empire. In the chief, provincial cities the ruling&nbsp;counts were replaced by dukes, subordinate to the exarch ;&nbsp;and the smaller towns were governed by military tribunes.&nbsp;Instead of dukes, we sometimes find </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">magistm militum,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">apparently of higher rank. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">praefectus praetorio</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Italy, likewise a dependant of the exarch, was at the head&nbsp;of the civil administration. The pragmatic sanction (554),&nbsp;promulgating the Justinian code, again separated the&nbsp;civil from the military power, which was no longer allowed&nbsp;to intervene in the settlement of private disputes, and, by&nbsp;conferring on the bishops the superintendence of and&nbsp;authority over the provincial and municipal government,&nbsp;soon led to the increase of the power of the church, which&nbsp;had already considerable influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new organization outwardly resembled that of the Goths : one army had been replaced by another, the counts&nbsp;by dukes ; there was an exarch instead of a king ; the&nbsp;civil and military jurisdictions were more exactly defined.&nbsp;But the army was not, like that of the Goths, a conquering nation in arms ; it was a Graeco-Roman army, and did&nbsp;not hold a third of the territory which was now probably&nbsp;added to the possessions of the state. The soldiery&nbsp;took its pay from Constantinople, whence all instructions&nbsp;and appointments of superior officers likewise proceeded.&nbsp;In Rome we find a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mαgister militum</span><span class="font1"> at the head of the&nbsp;troops. The Roman senate still existed, but was reduced to a shadow. Theodoric had left it intact until he&nbsp;suspected it of hostile designs and dealings with the&nbsp;Byzantines, but then began to persecute it, as was proved&nbsp;by the wretched fate of Boetius and Symmachus. Nevertheless the senate survived, added the functions of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">curia&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or municipal council to those of a governmental assembly,&nbsp;and took part in the election of the pope—already one of&nbsp;the chief affairs of Rome. So many senators, however, were&nbsp;slaughtered during the Byzantine war that it was commonly believed to be extinct. The pragmatic sanction,&nbsp;conferring on senate and pope the superintendence of&nbsp;weights and measures in Italy, is a convincing proof to&nbsp;the contrary, although, in the general chaos, now that</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
