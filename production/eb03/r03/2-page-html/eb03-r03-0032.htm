<p><span class="font1">Near this place the Engliſh received three defeats in one day under John de Segrave the Engliſh regent&nbsp;of Scotland in 1302. The Scots, under their generals&nbsp;Cummin and Fraſer, had reſolved to furpriſe Segrave ;&nbsp;with which view they began their march on the night&nbsp;of Saturday preceding the firſt Sunday of Lent, and&nbsp;reached the Engliſh army by break of day. Segrave,&nbsp;however, had time to have fallen back upon the other&nbsp;d!vifion which lay behind him ; but, either deſpiſing his&nbsp;enemies too much, or thinking that he would be diſho·&nbsp;noured by a retreat, he encountered the Scots ; the&nbsp;conſequence of which was, that he himſelf was made&nbsp;priſoner, and all his men either killed or taken, except&nbsp;i nch as fled to the other diviſion. As in this routed diviſion there had been no fewer than 300 knights, each&nbsp;of whom brought at leaſt five horſemen into the field,&nbsp;great part of the Scots inſantiy quickly furniſhed themſelves with their horſes ; but, as they were dividing the&nbsp;ſpoils, another diviſion oſ the Engliſh appeared, and&nbsp;the Scots were obliged to fight them alſo. The Engliſh,&nbsp;after a bloody engagement, were defeated a ſecond time;&nbsp;which was no ſooner done, than the third and moſt&nbsp;powerful diviſion made its appearance. The Scots were&nbsp;now quite exhauſted ; and, pleading the exceſſive labours they had already undergone, earneſtly requeſted&nbsp;their geperals to allow them to retreat while it was yet&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ip </span><span class="font1">their power. Their two generals, who perhaps knew&nbsp;that to be impracticable, reminded them of the cauſe for&nbsp;which they were fighting, the tyranny of the Engliſh,&nbsp;&amp;c. and by theſe arguments prevailed upon them to&nbsp;fight a third time ; though, previous to the engagement, they were reduced to the cruel neceſſitv of putting all the common ſoldiers whom they had made pri-ſoners to the ſword. The victory of the Scots at this&nbsp;time was leſs complete than the other two had been ;&nbsp;ſince they could not prevent the retreat of the Engliſh&nbsp;to Edinburgh, nor Segrave from being reſcued from&nbsp;bis captivity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSMARINUS, rosemary, in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the diandria claſs of plants, and in the natural method ranking under&nbsp;the 42d order, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pertiιillatee.</span><span class="font1"> The corolla is unequal,&nbsp;with its upper lip bipartite ; the filaments are long, curved, and ſimple, each having a ſmall dent. There are&nbsp;two ſpecies, the anguſtifolia anti latifolia, or narrow and&nbsp;broad leaved roſemary ; of which the ſecond has larger&nbsp;flowers and a ſtronger ſcent than the other. There are&nbsp;two varieties ; one oſ the ſirſt fort with ſtriped leaves, called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ſilver roſemary ;</span><span class="font1"> and the other with yellow, whence&nbsp;it is called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">goldſlriped roſematy.</span><span class="font1"> Theſe plants grow&nbsp;naturally in the ſouthern parts of France, Spain, and&nbsp;Italy ; where, upon dry rocky ſoils near the ſea, they&nbsp;thrive prodigiouſly, and perfume the air in ſuch a manner as to be ſmelt at a great diſtance from the land.—&nbsp;However, they are hardy enough to bear the cold of&nbsp;our ordinary winters, provided they be planted upon a&nbsp;poor, dry, gravelly ſoil, on which they will endure the&nbsp;cold much better than in a richer ground, where, growing more vigorouſly in ſummer, they are more apt to&nbsp;be injured by froſt in winter ; nor wfill they have ſuch a&nbsp;ſtrong aromatic ſcent as thoſe on a dry and barren ſoil.&nbsp;They are to be propagated either by flips or cuttings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roſemary has a fragrant ſmell, and a warm pungent bitteriſh taſte, approaching to thoſe of lavender : the&nbsp;leaves and tender tops are ſtrongeſt ; next to thoſe, the&nbsp;cup of the flower ; the flowers themſelves are conhder-ably the weakeſt, but moſt pleaſant. Aqueous liquors&nbsp;extract great ſliare of the virtues-of roſemary leaves by&nbsp;infuſion, and elevate them in eiiſtillation ; along with·&nbsp;the water ariſes a conſiderable quantity of eſſential oil,&nbsp;of an agreeable ſtrong penetrating ſmell. Pure ſpirit&nbsp;extracts in great perfection the whole aromatic flavour&nbsp;of the roſemary, and elevates very little of it in diſtillation ; hence the reſinous maſs, left upon extracting&nbsp;the ſpirit, proves an elegant aromatic, very rich in the&nbsp;peculiar qualities of the plant. The flowers of roſemary' give over great part of their flavour in diſtillation with pure ſpirit ; by watery liquors, their fragrance is much injured ; by beating, deſtroyed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSS, in Herefordſhire, in England, 119 miles; from London, is a fine old town, with a good trade,&nbsp;on the river Wye. It was made a free borough by’&nbsp;Henry III.
