            <p>ently deſcribed by different authors, but by all agreed to be an extremely bold and
                active bird. It is a native of the northern regions of Europe; and a variety called
                by ſome writers the <hi rend="italic">ſpeckled partridge hawk</hi> is found at
                Hudſon’s bay, North America.</p>
            <p>SACRED, ſomething holy, or that is ſolemnly offered and conſecrated to God, with
                benedictions, unctions, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Kings, prelates, and prieſts, are reckoned ſacred perſons; abbots are only blessed. —
                The deaconhood, ſub- deaconhood, and prieſthood, are all ſacred orders, and are ſaid
                to impreſs a ſacred indelible character. The cuſtom of conſecrating kings with holy
                oil is derived (ſays Gutlingius) from the Hebrews; among whom, he agrees with
                Grotius, it was never uſed but to kings who had not an evident right by ſucceſſion.
                He adds, that the Chriſtian emperors never uſed it before Juſtin the younger; from
                whom he takes it to have paſſed to the Goths, &amp;c.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sacred</hi> is alſo applied to things belonging to God and the
                church. Church-lands, ornaments, &amp;c. are held ſacred. —The ſacred college is
                that of the cardinals.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic smallcaps">Sacred</hi><hi rend="italic"> Majeſty,</hi> is applied to
                the emperor and to the king of England; yet Loyſeau ſays it is blaſphemy. See <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">Majesty.</hi> The ancients held a place ſtruck with thunder as
                ſacred. In the civil law, ſacred place chiefly denotes that where a perſon deceased
                has been interred.</p>

            <p>SACRIFICE, an offering made to God on an altar, by means of a regular miniſter, as an
                acknowledgment of his power, and a payment of homage. Sacrifices (though the term is
                ſometimes uſed to comprehend all the offerings made to God, or in any way devoted to
                his ſervice and honour) differ from mere oblations in this, that in a ſacrifice
                there is a real deſtruction or change of the thing offered; whereas an oblation is
                only a ſimple offering or gift, without any ſuch change at all: thus, all forts of
                tythes, and firſt fruits, and whatever of mens worldly ſub- ſtance is conſecrated to
                God, for the ſupport of his worſhip and the maintenance of his miniſters, are
                offerings or oblations: and theſe, under the Jewiſh law, were either of living
                creatures or other things: but ſacrifices, in the more peculiar ſenſe of the term,
                were either wholly or in part conſumed by fire. They have by divines been divided
                into bloody and unbloody. Bloody ſacriſices were made of living creatures; unbloody
                of the fruits of the earth. They have alſo been divided into <hi rend="italic"
                    >expiatory, impetrαtory,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">euchariſtical.</hi> The
                firſt kind were offered to obtain of God forgiveneſs of sins; the ſecond, to procure
                ſome favour; and the third, to expreſs thankfulneſs for favours already received.
                Under one or other of theſe heads may all ſacriſices be arranged; though we are
                told, that the Egyptians had 666 different kinds, a number ſurpaſſing all
                credibility.</p>
            <p>Concerning the origin of ſacriſices very various opinions have been held. By many,
                the Phoenicians are ſuppoſed to have been the authors of them; though Porphyry
                attributes their invention to the Egyptians; and Ovid imagines, from the import of
                the name <hi rend="italic">victim </hi>and <hi rend="italic">hoftia,</hi> that no
                bloody ſacriſices were offered till wars prevailed in the world, and nations
                obtained victories</p>
            <p>over their enemies. Theſe are mere hypotheſes,
                contradicted by the moſt authentic records of antiquity, and entitled to no
                regard.</p>
            <p>By modern deiſts, ſacriſices are ſaid to have had their origin in ſuperſtition, which
                operates much in the ſame way in every country. It is therefore weak, according to
                thoſe men, to derive this practice from any particular people; ſince the ſame mode
                of reaſoning would lead various nations, without any intercourſe with each other, to
                entertain the ſame opinions reſpecting the nature of their gods, and the proper
                means of appeaſing their anger. Men of groſs conceptions imagine their deities to be
                like themſelves, covetous and cruel. They are accuſtomed to appeaſe an injured
                neighbour by a compoſition in money; and they endeavour to compound in the ſame
                manner with their gods, by rich offerings to their temples and to their prieſts. The
                moſt valuable property of a ſimple people is their cattle. Theſe offered in
                ſacrifice are ſuppoſed to be fed upon by the divinity, and are actually fed upon by
                his prieſts. If a crime is committed which requires the puniſhment of death, it is
                accounted perfectly fair to appeaſe the deity by offering one life for another;
                becauſe, by ſavages, puniſhment is conſidered as a debt for which a man may compound
                in the beſt way that he can, and which one man may pay for another. Hence, it is
                ſaid, aroſe the abſurd notions of imputed guilt and vicarious atonement. Among the
                Egyptians, a white bull was choſen as an expiatory ſacrifice to their god Apis.
                After being killed at the altar, his head was cut off, and call into the river, with
                the following execration: “May all the evils impending over thoſe who perform this
                ſacriſice, or over the Egyptians in general, be averted on this head@@*. ”</p>
            <p>Had ſacrifice never prevailed in the world but among ſuch groſs idolaters as
                worſhipped departed heroes, who were ſuppoſed to retain in their ſtate of
                deification all the paſſions and appetites of their mortal ſtate, this account of
                the origin of that mode of worſhip would have been to us perfectly ſatisfactory. We
                readily admit, that ſuch mean notions of their gods may have actually led far
                diſtant tribes, who could not derive any thing from each other through the channel
                of tradition, to imagine that beings of human paſſions and appetites might be
                appeaſed or bribed by coſtly offerings. But we know from the moſt incontrovertible
                authority, that ſacriſices of the three kinds that we have mentioned were in uſe
                among people who worſhipped the true God, and who muſt have had very correct notions
                of his attributes. Now we think it impoſſible that ſuch notions could have led any
                man to fancy that the taking away of the life of a harmleſs animal, or the burning
                of a cake or other fruits of the earth in the fire, would be acceptable to a Being
                ſelf-exiſtent, omnipotent, and omniſcient, who can neither be injured by the crimes
                of his creatures, nor receive any acceſſion of happineſs from a thouſand worlds.</p>
            <p>Senſible of the force of ſuch reaſoning as this, ſome perſons of great name, who
                admit the authenticity of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian ſacriſices, and firmly rely on
                the atonement made by Chriſt, are yet unwilling (it is difficult to conceive for
                what reaſon) to allow that ſacrifices were originally inſtituted by God. Of this way
                of thinking were St Chryſoſtom, Spencer, Grotius, and Warburton, as were likewiſe
                the Jews Maimonides, R.</p>
