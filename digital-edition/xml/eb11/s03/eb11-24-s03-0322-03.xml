N. of the Hague, with which it is connected by tramways. It is situated in the dunes at the extremity of the woods which separate it from the Hague. The development of Scheveningen as a fashionable seaside resort dates from modern times, but the fishing village is of ancient origin and once stood farther seaward. To prevent coast erosion a stone wall was built along the sea front in 1896-1900, and below this lies the fine sandy beach stretching for miles on either side. The first bathing establishment here dates from 1818, and was also the first in Holland. Overlooking the sea from the top of the dunes on either side are villas, hotels, and the pavilion (1826) belonging to the family of Prince von Wied. The costumes of the fishing community are picturesque, the men having silver buttons and wide trousers, the women wide skirts and brass helmets. There is a large harbour for the fishing fleet at the mouth of the Hague-Scheveningen canal. Among the historical memories associated with Scheveningen are the defeat of the combined French and English fleets by Admiral de Ruyter in 1673, and the flight and subsequent return of William I., king of the Netherlands, in 1813, at the beginning and end of the French occupation. This is commemorated by an obelisk (1865). The town has a rapidly growing population of about 23,000.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
