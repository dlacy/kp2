<p><span class="font2">cd </span><span class="font0">to </span><span class="font2">the king, by their ſpeaker Sir Thomas Audley, of thele reflections thrown out againſt them ; and the.&nbsp;biſhop was obliged to retract his words.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Though Henry had not the leaſt idea of rejecting any, even of the moſt abſurd Romiſh ſuperſtitions, yet&nbsp;as the oppreſſions of the clergy ſuited very ill with the&nbsp;violence of his own temper, he was pleaſed with every&nbsp;opportunity of leffening their power. In the parliament of 1531, he ſhowed his deſign of humbling the&nbsp;clergy in the moſt effectual manner. An obſolete ſtatute was revived, from which it was pretended that it&nbsp;was criminal to ſubmit to the legatine power which&nbsp;had been exerciſed by cardinal wolſey. By this ftroke&nbsp;the whole body of clergy was declared guilty at once.&nbsp;They were too well acquainted with Henry’s diſpoſition, however, to reply, that their ruin would have&nbsp;been the certain conſequence of their not ſubmitting&nbsp;to wolſey’s commiſſion which had been given by royal&nbsp;authority. Inſtead of making any defence of this kind,&nbsp;they choſe to throw themſelves on the mercy of their&nbsp;ſovereign ; whieh, however, it coil them 118,8401. to&nbsp;procure. A confeſſion was likewife extorted from&nbsp;them, that the king was protector and ſupreme head&nbsp;of the church of England ; though ſome of them had&nbsp;the dexterity to get a clauſe inferted, which invalidated&nbsp;the whole ſubmiſſion, viz. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in Jo far as is permitted by&nbsp;the law of Chrifl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The king, having thus begun to reduce the power of the clergy, kept no bounds with them,afterwards.&nbsp;He did not indeed attempt any reformation in religious&nbsp;matters ; nay, he perſecuted moſt violently ſuch as did&nbsp;attempt this in the leaſt. Indeed, the moſt effential&nbsp;article of his creed ſeems to have been his own ſupre-macy ; for whoever denied this, was ſure to ſuffer the&nbsp;moſt ſevere penalties, whether Proteſtant or Papiſt.&nbsp;But an account of the abſurd and cruel conduct of this&nbsp;prince, and of his final quarrel with the pope on aecount of his refuſing a diſpenſation to marry Anne Bo-leyn, is given under the article England, n<sup>o</sup> 253—&nbsp;292.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">He died in 1547, aud was ſucceeded by his only ſon Edward VI. This amiable prince, whofe early&nbsp;youth was crowned with that wiſdom, ſagacity, and virtue, that would have done honour to advanced years,&nbsp;,gave new ſpirit and vigour to the Proteſtant cauſe, and&nbsp;was its brighteſt ornament, as weſt as its moſt effectual ſupport. He encouraged learned and pious men&nbsp;cf foreign countries to fettle in England, and addreſ-ſed a particular invitation to Martin Bucer and Paul&nbsp;Fagius, whoſe moderation added a luſtre to their other&nbsp;virtues, that, by the miniſtry and labours of theſe eminent men, in concert with thoſe of the friends of the&nbsp;Reformation in England, he might purge his domi-nions from the fordid fictions of popery, and eſtabliſh&nbsp;the pure doctrines of Chriſtianity in their place. For&nbsp;this purpoſe, he iffued out the wiſeſt orders for the&nbsp;reſtoration of true religion; but his reign was too ſhort&nbsp;to accompliſh fully ſuch a glorious purpoſe. In the&nbsp;year 1553, he was taken from hrs loving and afflicted&nbsp;-ſubjects, whoſe ſorrow was inexpreſſihle, and ſuited to&nbsp;their loſs. His filter Mary (the daughter of Catharine&nbsp;of Arragon, from whom Henry had been ſeparated by&nbsp;the famous divorce), a furious bigot to the elιurch of&nbsp;Rome, and a prîncefs whoſe natural character, like the&nbsp;ſpirit of her religion, was deſpotic and cruel, ſucceeded&nbsp;him on the Britiſh throne, and impoſed anew the arbitrary laws and the tyrannical yoke of Rome upon </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">people of England. Nor were the methods ſhe employed in the eauſe of ſuperſtition better than the cauſe&nbsp;itſelf', or tempered by any ſentiments of equity or com-.&nbsp;paſſion. Barbarous tortures and death, in the moſt&nbsp;ſhocking forms, awaited thoſe who oppofed her will, or&nbsp;made the leaſt ſtand againſt the reſtoration of Popery.&nbsp;And among many other victims, the learned and pious&nbsp;Cranmer, archbi(hop of Canterbury, who had been one&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ot</span><span class="font2"> the moſt iſtuſtrious inſtruments of the Reformation&nbsp;in England, fell a ſacriſice to her ſury. This odious&nbsp;ſcene of perſecution was happily concluded in the year&nbsp;1558, by the death of the queen, who left no iffιιe ;&nbsp;and, as ſoon as her ſucceiſor the lady Elizabeth aſcended the throne, all things affumed a new and a plealin-∕&nbsp;afpect. This iſtuſtrious princeſs, whoſe fentiments°,&nbsp;counſels, and projects, breathed a ſpirit ſuperior to the&nbsp;natural ſoftneſs and delicacy of her ſex, exerted this&nbsp;vigorous and manly ſpirit in the defence of oppreffed&nbsp;conſcience and expiring liberty, broke anew the de-ſpotic yoke of Papal authority and ſuperſtition, and,&nbsp;delivering her people from the bondage of Rome, eſtabliſhed that form of religious doctrine and eccleſiaſtical&nbsp;government which ſtill ſubſiſts in England. This religious eſtabliſhment differs, in ſome reſpects, from the&nbsp;plan that had been formed by thoſe whom Edward VI.&nbsp;had employed for promoting the cauſe of the Reforma-<sub>v</sub></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tion, and approaches nearer to the rites and diſcipline &quot; of former.times ; though it is widely different, and, in&nbsp;the moſt important points, entirely oppoſite to the principles of the Roman hierarchy. See England, n<sup>0</sup> 293.,&nbsp;&amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The cauſe of the reformation underwent in Ireland the ſame viciſſitudes and revolutions that had attended&nbsp;it in England, when Henry VHL after the abolition&nbsp;of tlie Papal authority, was declared ſupreme head upon&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">eaιtiι </span><span class="font2">of the church of England, George Brown, a native of England, and a monk of the Auguſtine order,&nbsp;whom that monarch had created, in the year 1535,&nbsp;archbiſhop of Dublin, began to act with the utmoſt&nbsp;vigour in conſequence of this change in the hierarchy.&nbsp;He purged the churches of his dioceſe from ſuperſtition in all its various forms, pulled down images, deſtroyed relics, aboliſhed abſurd and idolatrous rites, and,&nbsp;by the influence as weſt as authority he had in Ireland,&nbsp;cauſed the king’s ſupremacy to be acknowledged in&nbsp;that nation. Henry ſhowed, ſoon after, that this ſupremacy was not a vain title ; for he baniſhed the&nbsp;monks out of that kingdom, connſcated their revenues,&nbsp;and deſtroyed their couvents. In the reign of Edward&nbsp;VI. ſtſtl farther progreſs was made in the removal of&nbsp;Popiſh ſuperſtitions, by the. zealous labours of biſhop&nbsp;Brown, and the aufpicious encouragement he granted&nbsp;to all who exerted themſelves in the cauſe of the Reformation. But the death of this excellent prince,&nbsp;and the acceſſion of queen Mary, had like to have&nbsp;changed the face of affairs in Ireland as much as in,&nbsp;England ; but her deligns were difappointed by a very&nbsp;curious adventure, of which the following account has&nbsp;been copied from the papers of Richard earl of Cυrke.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">&quot; Queen Mary having dealt ſeverely with the Proteſtants in England, about the latter end of her reign ſigned a commiſſion for to take the ſame courſe with&nbsp;them in Ireland ; and to execute the fame with greater&nbsp;force, ſhe nominates Dr Cole one of the commiſſioners.&nbsp;This Doctor coming, with the commiſſion, to Cheſter</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
