<p><span class="font1">RIEMANN, Geoeg Feiedeich Beenhaed (1826-1866), mathematician, was born on the 17th September 1826, at Breselenz, near Dannenberg in Hanover. His&nbsp;father Friedrich Bernhard Riemann came from Mecklenburg, had served in the war of freedom, and had finally&nbsp;settled as pastor in Quickborn. Here with his five brothers&nbsp;and sisters Riemann spent his boyhood and received, chiefly&nbsp;from his father, the elements of his education. He&nbsp;showed at an early age well-marked mathematical powers,&nbsp;and his progress was so rapid in arithmetic and geometry&nbsp;that he was soon beyond the guidance not only of his&nbsp;father but of schoolmaster Schulz, who assisted in the&nbsp;mathematical department of his training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1840 he went to live with his grandmother at Hanover, where he attended the lyceum. After her death,&nbsp;two years later, he entered the Johanneum at Lüneburg,&nbsp;where he finished in four years more his gymnasial education. Notwithstanding some disadvantages due to defects&nbsp;in his earlier training, and more particularly to shyness&nbsp;arising from his rustic upbringing, he speedily distinguished&nbsp;himself in all the branches of the gymnasial course, and&nbsp;was already known by the school authorities as a mathematician of great promise. The director, Schmalfuss,&nbsp;encouraged him in his mathematical studies by lending&nbsp;him books (among them Euler’s works and Legendre’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Theory of Numbers),</span><span class="font1"> and readily understood that he had&nbsp;no ordinary schoolboy to deal with when he found that&nbsp;works of such profoundity were read, mastered, and&nbsp;returned within a few days. In 1846, in his twentieth&nbsp;year, Riemann entered himself as a student of philology&nbsp;and theology in the university of Gottingen. This choice&nbsp;of a university career was dictated more by the natural&nbsp;desire of his father to see his son enter his own profession,&nbsp;and by the poverty of his family, which rendered the&nbsp;speedy earning of his living a matter of importance, than&nbsp;by his own preference. He sacrificed so far to the bent&nbsp;of his genius as to attend lectures on the numerical&nbsp;solution of equations and on definite integrals by Stern,&nbsp;on terrestrial magnetism by Goldschmidt, and on the&nbsp;method of least squares by Gauss. It soon became&nbsp;evident that his mathematical studies, undertaken at first&nbsp;probably as a relaxation, were destined to be the chief&nbsp;business of his life ; and he obtained his father’s permission to devote himself entirely to a scientific career. By&nbsp;this time he had exhausted the resources of Göttingen in&nbsp;the shape of mathematical lectures ; and he proceeded in&nbsp;the beginning of 1847 to Berlin, attracted thither by that&nbsp;brilliant constellation of mathematical genius whose principal stars were Dirichlet, Jacobi, Steiner, and Eisenstein.&nbsp;He appears to have attended Dirichlet’s lectures on theory&nbsp;of numbers, theory of definite integrals, and partial differential equations, and Jacobi’s on analytical mechanics&nbsp;and higher algebra. It was during this period that he&nbsp;first formed those ideas on the theory of functions of a&nbsp;complex variable which led to most of his great discoveries.&nbsp;One stirring social incident at least marked this part of&nbsp;his life, for, during the revolutionary insurrection in&nbsp;March 1848, the young mathematician, as a member of a&nbsp;company of student volunteers, kept guard in the royal&nbsp;palace from 9 o’clock on the morning of the 24th March&nbsp;till 1 o’clock on the afternoon of the following day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1850 he returned to Göttingen and began to prepare his doctor’s dissertation, busying himself meanwhile with&nbsp;“ Naturphilosophie ” and experimental physics. In pursuit of the latter he entered the mathematical and physical&nbsp;seminary, then newly started by Weber, Ulrich, Stern,&nbsp;and Listing. This double cultivation of his scientific&nbsp;powers, doubtless due more to the influence of Göttingen&nbsp;as represented by Gauss than to Berlin, had the happiest&nbsp;effect on his subsequent work ; for the greatest achieve;&nbsp;ments of Riemann were effected by the application in pure&nbsp;mathematics generally of a method (theory of potential)&nbsp;which had up to this time been used solely in the solution&nbsp;of certain problems that arise in mathematical physics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In November 1851 he obtained his doctorate, the thesis being “ Grundlagen für eine allgemeine Theorie der&nbsp;Functionen einer veränderlichen complexen Grösse.” This&nbsp;memoir excited the admiration of Gauss, and at once&nbsp;marked its author’s rank as a mathematician. The fundamental method of research which Riemann employed has&nbsp;just been alluded to ; the results will be best indicated in&nbsp;his own words :—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The methods in use hitherto for treating functions of a complex variable always started from an expression for the function as its&nbsp;definition, whereby its value was given for every value of the&nbsp;argument ; by our investigation it has been shown that, in&nbsp;consequence of the general character of a function of a complex&nbsp;variable, in a definition of this sort one part of the determining&nbsp;conditions is a consequence of the rest, and the extent of the determining conditions has been reduced to what is necessary to effect&nbsp;the determination. This essentially simplifies the treatment of&nbsp;such functions. Hitherto, in order to prove the equality of two&nbsp;expressions for the same function, it was necessary to transform&nbsp;the one into the other, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.,</span><span class="font0"> to show that both expressions agreed&nbsp;for every value of the variable ; now it is sufficient to prove their&nbsp;agreement to a far less extent ” [merely in certain critical points&nbsp;and at certain boundaries].</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The time between his promotion to the doctorate and his habilitation as privat-docent was occupied by researches undertaken for his Habilitationsschrift, by&nbsp;“Naturphilosophie,” and by experimental work partly as&nbsp;Weber’s assistant in the mathematical physical seminary,&nbsp;and partly as collaborateur with Weber and Kohlrausch in&nbsp;special researches on electricity. In connexion with the&nbsp;results of Kohlrausch regarding the residual discharge of&nbsp;condensers, Riemann worked out a theory of this phenomenon which he intended to have published in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poggen-dorff<sup>,</sup>s Annalen.</span><span class="font1"> For some reason not fully explained it&nbsp;was not published at all during his lifetime, and its place&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annalen</span><span class="font1"> was taken by an elegant little paper on&nbsp;Nobili’s rings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The subject he had chosen for his Habilitationsschrift was the “ Representation of a Function by means of a Trigonometrical Series,” a subject which Dirichlet had made his&nbsp;own by a now well-known series of researches. It was&nbsp;fortunate no doubt for Riemann that he had the kind&nbsp;advice and encouragement of Dirichlet himself, who was&nbsp;then on a visit at Göttingen during the preparation of his&nbsp;essay ; but the result λvas a memoir of such originality and&nbsp;refinement as showed that the pupil was fully the equal&nbsp;of the master. Of the customary three themes which lie</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
