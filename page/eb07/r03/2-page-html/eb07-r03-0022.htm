<p><span class="font1">RUNGPOOR, a town and district of Hindustan, in the north-eastern extremity of Bengal, situated about the twentieth degree of north latitude. The district is bounded on the&nbsp;north by the Bootan Hills, on the south by Mymunsing, on&nbsp;the east by the Brahmapootra, and on the west by Dinagepore. The river Durlah separates it from Couch Bahar.&nbsp;It is an open country, level, and well watered and productive. It yields in abundance silk, rice, indigo, hemp, and&nbsp;tobacco. Some parts of it are equal in fertility to any part&nbsp;of Bengal; but, on the whole, it is not so well cultivated or&nbsp;so populous as the other parts of this province. Besides the&nbsp;Brahmapootra, the principal rivers are the Teestah and the&nbsp;Durlah; and the chief towns Rungpoor, Mungulhaut, and&nbsp;Guzgotta. The tobacco grown here is mostly consumed in&nbsp;the southern and eastern districts of Bengal. The glandular swellings of the throat are very prevalent amongst the&nbsp;inhabitants, although parts of the district are a hundred&nbsp;miles distant from the Alpine region. This district was&nbsp;taken possession of by the Mahommedans early in the thirteenth century, and was always governed by a military collector. It was at first partially wrested from the rajah of&nbsp;Couch Bahar, when it was formed into a circar, and was&nbsp;finally conquered by the generals of Aurungzebe. It is&nbsp;now under a British establishment of a judge, collector, &amp;c.&nbsp;The result of some queries by the Marquis of Wellesley in&nbsp;1801 gave a population of 400,000. Rungpoor, the capital, is situated on the eastern bank of the Goggot river. It&nbsp;is a regularly-built town, and carries on a considerable trade&nbsp;with Bootan, Assam, and Calcutta. Long. 89. 5. E. Lat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">25. 47. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUNGPORE, an extensive fortress of Hindustan, which is sometimes, but erroneously, called the capital of Assam.&nbsp;Gergong is the real capital, of which Rungpore is only the&nbsp;fort. It is situated on an island, and can only be approached&nbsp;by a bridge, which was built centuries ago, and remains a&nbsp;monument of the abilities of the Bengal artificers who were&nbsp;employed to construct it. Long. 94. 40. E. Lat. 20.35. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUNIC, a term applied to the language and letters of the ancient Goths, Danes, and other northern nations. See&nbsp;Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUNNER, in nautical language, a rope belonging to the garnet and the two bolt-tackles. It is received in a single&nbsp;block joined to the end of a pendant; it has at one end a&nbsp;hook to hitch into any thing, and at the other a double&nbsp;block, into which is reeved the fall of the tackle, or the garnet, by which means it purchases more than the tackle&nbsp;would without it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUNNET, or Rennet, is the concreted milk found in the stomachs of sucking quadrupeds, which have as yet received no other nourishment than their mother’s milk. In&nbsp;ruminating animals, which have several stomachs, it is generally found in the last, though sometimes in the next to&nbsp;it. If the runnet is dried in the sun, and then kept close,&nbsp;it may be preserved in perfection for years. Not only the&nbsp;runnet itself, but also the stomach in which it is found,&nbsp;curdles milk without any previous preparation. But the&nbsp;common method is, to take the inner membrane of a calf’s&nbsp;stomach, to clean it well, to salt and hang it up in brown&nbsp;paper. When this is used the salt is washed off, then it is&nbsp;macerated in a little watbr during the night, and in the&nbsp;morning the infusion is poured into the milk to curdle it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUPEE, a silver coin current in the East Indies, equal to about two shillings and sixpence sterling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUPERT, Prince palatine of the Rhine, son of Frederick prince elector palatine of the Rhine, and Elizabeth daughter of James I. of England, was born in 1619. He&nbsp;gave proofs of his bravery at the age of thirteen; and in&nbsp;1642 came over into England, and offered Iris service to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Charles I. his uncle, who gave him a command in his army. At Edgehill he charged with incredible bravery, and made&nbsp;a very great slaughter of the parliamentarians. In 1643 he&nbsp;seized the town of Cirencester, obliged the governor of Lichfield to surrender, and having joined his brother Prince Maurice, reduced Bristol in three days, and passed to the relief&nbsp;of Newark. In 1644 he marched to relieve York, where&nbsp;he gave the parliamentarians battle, and entirely defeated&nbsp;their right wing; but Cromwell charged the Marquis of&nbsp;Newcastle with such an irresistible force, that Prince Rupert was entirely defeated. After this the prince put himself into Bristol, which surrendered to Fairfax after a gallant&nbsp;resistance. The king was so enraged at the loss of this city,&nbsp;so contrary to his expectation, that he recalled all Prince&nbsp;Rupert’s commissions, and sent him </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">pass to go out of the&nbsp;kingdom. In 1648 he went to France, where he was highly&nbsp;complimented bv that court, and kindly received by Charles</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. who for the time sojourned there. Afterwards he was&nbsp;constituted admiral of the king’s navy; attacked the Dutch&nbsp;ships, many of which he took ; and having engaged with De&nbsp;Ruyter, obliged him to fly. He died in 1682, and was interred with great magnificence in Henry VII.’s chapel,&nbsp;Westminster. Mr Grainger observes, that he possessed in&nbsp;a high degree that kind of courage which is better in an&nbsp;attack than a defence, and is less adapted to the land-service than that of the sea, where precipitate valour is in its&nbsp;element. He seldom engaged but he gained the advantage,&nbsp;which, however, he generally lost by pursuing it too far. He&nbsp;was better qualified to storm a citadel, or even to mount&nbsp;a breach, than patiently to sustain a siege, and would have&nbsp;furnished an excellent hand to a general of a cooler head.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This prince is celebrated for the invention of prints in mezzotinto, of which he is said to have taken the hint from&nbsp;a soldier’s scraping his rusty fusil. The first print of this&nbsp;kind ever published was done by his highness, and may be&nbsp;seen in the first edition of Evelyn’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sculptra.</span><span class="font1"> The secret&nbsp;is said to have been soon afterwards discovered by Sherwin,&nbsp;an engraver, who made use of a loaded file for laying the&nbsp;ground. The prince, upon seeing one of his prints, suspected that his servant had lent him his tool, which was a&nbsp;channelled roller; but upon receiving full satisfaction to the&nbsp;contrary, he made him a present of it. The roller was&nbsp;afterwards laid aside; and an instrument with a crenelled&nbsp;edge, shaped like a shoemaker’s cutting knife, was used instead of it. He also invented a metal called by his name,&nbsp;in which guns were cast; and contrived an excellent method of boring them, for which purpose a water-mill was&nbsp;erected at Hackney-marsh, to the great detriment of the&nbsp;undertaker, the secret dying with the inventor.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Rupert's Drops,</span><span class="font1"> a sort of glass drops with long and slender tails, which burst to pieces on the breaking off those tails in any part. They are said to have been invented&nbsp;by Prince Rupert, and are therefore called by his name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUPNAGUR, a town of Hindustan, in the province of Ajmeer, belonging to Dowlet Row Scindia. It is thirteen&nbsp;miles north-east from the city of Ajmeer. Long 74. 58. E.&nbsp;Lat. 26. 43. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUPPIN, a city of Prussia, the capital of a circle of the same name, in the government of Potsdam, which extends&nbsp;over 725 square miles, and comprehends five cities, 97 villages, 84 hamlets, and 54,600 inhabitants. The city is situated on the lake Rhin, whence, by sluices, a stream is&nbsp;carried through it. Although ancient, it is well built, and&nbsp;was formerly fortified. It contains two churches, a gymnasium with six professors, and in 1834 had 800 houses and&nbsp;7415 inhabitants. By a lake and a canal which joins the river Havel, the trade is extended to the Elbe. The occupations of the citizens chiefly consist in making woollen goods&nbsp;of various kinds, tanning leather, brewing beer, and distilling corn-spirits. Near to it there is much tobacco cultivated.
