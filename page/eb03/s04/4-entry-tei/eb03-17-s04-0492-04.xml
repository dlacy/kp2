the <hi rend="smallcaps">Monkey,</hi> a genus of quadrupeds belonging to the claſs of mammalia, and order of primates, in the Linnæan ſyſtem, but by Mr Pennant arranged under the digitated quadrupeds. According to the Linnæan ſyſtem, the characteriſtics of this genus are theſe : There are four cloſe ſet fore-teeth on each jaw ; ſingle tuſks on each ſide in both jaws, which are longer than the reſt, and ſomewhat remote from them. The grinders are obtuſe, and the feet are formed like hands. Mr Pennant gives the following generic deſcription of the fimia. There are four cutting teeth in each jaw, and two canine. Each of the feet are formed like hands, generally with flat nails, and, except in one inſtance, have four fingers and a thumb. There are eyebrows both above and below.</p><p>They are a numerous race ; but almoſt all confined to the torrid zone. They fill the woods of Africa from Senegal to the Cape, and from thence to Æthiopia. They are found in all parts of India, and its iſlands ; in Cochin-China, in the ſouth of China, and in Japan ; (and one is met with in Arabia) ; and they ſwarm in the foreſts of South America, from the isthmus of Darien as far as Paraguay. They are lively, agile, full of frolic, chatter, and grimace. From the ſtructure of their members, they have many actions in common with the human kind. Moſt of them are fierce and untameable ; ſome are of a milder nature, and will ſhow a degree of attachment ; but in general they are endowed with miſchievous intellects ; and are filthy, obſcene, laſcivious, and thieving. They inhabit the woods, and live on trees ; feeding on fruits, leaves, and insects. In general, they are gregarious, going in vaſt companies ; but the different ſpecies never mix with each other, always keeping apart and in different quarters. They leap with vaſt activity from tree to tree, even<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0499.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0493"/>
when loaded with their young, which cling to them. They are the prey of leopards and others of the feline race ; and of ſerpents, which purſue them to the ſummits of the trees, and ſwallow them entire. They are not carnivorous, but for miſchief’s ſake will rob the neſts of birds of the eggs and young. In the countries where they moſt abound, the ſagacity of the feathered tribe is more marvelouſly shown in their contrivances to fix the neſt beyond the reach of theſe invaders.</p><p>The simiæ being more numerous in their ſpecies than any other animals, and differing greatly in their appearances, it ſeemed neceſſary to methodize and ſubdivide the genus. Accordingly Mr Ray firſt diſtributed them into three claſſes.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Simiae,</hi> Apes, ſuch as wanted tails.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Cercopitheci,</hi> Monkeys, ſuch as had tails.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Papiones,</hi> Baboons, thoſe with ſhort tails ; to distinguiſh them from the common monkeys, which have very long ones.</p><p>The principal marks by which the ſpecies of this genus are diſtinguiſhable from each other, are derived, 1st, from the tail, which is either long, ſhort, or altogether wanting, or is ſtraight, or prehenſile ; 2dly, from the buttocks, which are naked, and furniſhed with callosities, or are covered with hair ; 3dly, from the nails, which are flat and rounded like those of man, or ſharp pointed like the claws of beaſts in general ; 4thly, from the preſence or abſence of a beard on the chin ; and, 5thly, from the cheeks being provided with, or wanting, pouches in their under parts. For greater convenience, the ſpecies of this genus, which are very numerous, are arranged under five ſubordinate divisions, conſidered as distinct genera by ſome authors, and not without reason. Three of theſe ſubdiviſions were adopted by Linnaeus ; but Dr Gmelin, following Buffon, has added other two taken from the third diviſion of his great precursor. Theſe ſubdiviſions are the simi <hi rend="italic">ae, papiones, cercopitheci, ſapaji,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ſagoini.</hi></p><p>I. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Simiæ,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Apes.</hi> They have no tails. The viſage is flat ; the teeth, hands, fingers, feet, toes, and nails, reſemble thoſe of man, and they walk naturally erect. This diviſion includes the simiæ, or apes properly ſo called, which are not found in America.</p><p>1. The chimpanzee, the ſimia troglodytes of Linnaeus, common in the mountains of Sierra Leona, reſembles man more than the orang-outang. This animal was firſt brought to Europe in 1738, when it was exhibited as a snow in London. The following deſcription of one that was kept ſome months at the colony of Sierra Leona is given by Wadſtrom, in his Eſſay on Colonization<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Part ii. p. 273.</p></note> *. He was nearly two feet high ; but the full ſtature is nearly five feet. He was covered with black hair, long and thick on the back, but ſhort and thin on the breaſt and belly. His face was bare ; his hands and his head reſembled those of an old black man, except that the hair on his head was ſtraight. He ate, drank, slept, and sat at table, like a human being. At firſt he crept on all fours, on the outside of his hands ; but, when grown larger, he endeavoured to go erect, ſupporting himſelf by a ſtick. He was melancholy, but always good natured.</p><p>2. The ſatyrus, orang-outang, or great ape, has a flat face, and a deformed reſemblance of the human ;</p><p>ears like thoſe of a man ; the hair on the head longer than on the body. The body and limbs are</p><p>covered with reddiſh and ſhaggy hair ; longeſt on the back, thinneſt on the fore-parts. The face and paws are swarthy ; the buttocks covered with hair. They inhabit the interior parts of Africa, the iſles of Sumatra, Borneo, and Java. Are ſolitary, and live in the moſt desert places. They grow to the height of six feet ; have prodigious ſtrength, and will overpower the ſtrongeſt man. The old ones are ſhot with arrows, the young alone can be taken alive. They live entirely on fruits and nuts. They will attack and kill the negroes who wander in the woods ; will drive away the elephants, and beat them with their fills or pieces of wood ; and will throw ſtones at people that offend them. They ſleep in trees ; and make a fort oſ ſhelter from the inclemency of the weather. They are of a grave appearance and melancholy diſposition, and even when young not inclined to frolic. They go erect, and are vaſtly ſwift and agile. Theſe accounts are chiefly taken from Andrew Battel, an Engliſh ſailor, who was taken priſoner 1589, and lived many years in the inner parts of Congo ; his narrative is plain, and ſeems very authentic. It is preſerved in Purchas’s collection. Froger<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Descript. Historique du Royaume de Macacar, p. 51.</p></note> * informs us, “ that thoſe along the banks of the river Ganges are larger and more miſchievous than in any part of Africa : the negroes dread them, and cannot travel alone in the country without running the hazard of being attacked by theſe animals, who often preſent them with a ſtick, and force them to fight. I have heard the Portugueſe ſay, that they have often ſeen them hoiſt up young girls, about ſeven or eight years old, into trees, and that they could not be wreſted from them without a great deal of difficulty. The moſt part of the negroes imagine them to be a foreign nation come to inhabit their country, and that they do not speak for fear of being compelled to work.” When taken young, they are capable of being tamed, and taught to perform many menial offices. Francis Pyrard<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Voyages de Francois Pyrard, tom. ii. p. 331.</p></note> * relates, “ that in the province of Sierra Leona, there is a ſpecies ſo ſtrong limbed, and ſo induſtrious, that, when properly trained and fed, they work like ſervants ; that they generally walk on the two hind feet ; that they pound any ſubſtances in a mortar ; that they go to bring water from the river in ſmall pitchers, which they carry full on their heads. But when they arrive at the door, if the pitchers are not ſoon taken off, they allow them to fall ; and when they perceive the pitchers overturned and broken, they weep and lament.” Father Jarric<note anchored="true" n="4" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Eus. Nieremberg, Hist. Nat. Peregrin. lib. ix. cap. 45.</p></note> *, quoted by Nieremberg, ſays the ſame thing, nearly in the same terms. With regard to the education of theſe animals, the teſtimony of Shoutten<note anchored="true" n="5" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Voyages de Guat. Shout ten aux Indes Orientales.</p></note> * accords with that of Pyrard. “ They are taken (he remarks) with ſnares, taught to walk on their hind feet, and to uſe their fore feet as hands in performing different operations, as rinsing glaſſes, carrying drink round the company, turning a ſpit, &amp; c.” “ I saw at Java</p><p>(ſays Guat<note anchored="true" n="6" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Voyage de Fr. le Guat, tom. ii. p. 96.</p></note> *) a very extraordinary ape. It was a female. She was very tall, and often walked erect on her hind feet. On theſe oceasions, ſhe concealed with her hands the parts which diſtinguiſh the ſex. Except the eye-brows, there was no hair on her face, which pretty much reſembled the groteſque ſemale faces I ſaw among the Hottentots at the Cape. She made her bed very neatly every day, lay upon her side, and covered herſelf with the bed cloaths. When her head ached, ſhe bound it up with a handkerchieſ ; and it was amusing to ſee<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0500.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0494"/>
her thus hooded in bed. I could relate many other little articles which appeared to me extremely singular. But I admired them not ſo much as the multitude ; becauſe, as I knew the deſign of bringing her to Europe to be exhibited as a ſhow, I was inclined to think that ſhe had been taught many of theſe monkey tricks, which the people conſidered as being natural to the animal. She died in our ſhip, about the latitude of the Cape of Good Hope. The figure of this ape had a very great reſemblance to that of man, &amp; c.” Gmelli Carreri tells us, that he ſaw one of theſe apes, which cried like an infant, walked upon its hind-feet, and carried a matt under its arm to lie down and ſleep upon.</p><p>An orang-outang which Buffon ſaw, is deſcribed by him as mild, affectionate, and good-natured. His air was melancholy, his gait grave, his movements meaſured, his diſpoſitions gentle, and very different from thoſe of other apes. He had neither the impatience of the Barbary ape, the maliciouſneſs of the baboon, nor the extravagance of the monkeys. “ It may be alleged, (says our author), that he had the benefit of inſtruction ; but the other apes which I ſhall compare with him, were educated in the ſame manner. Signs and words were alone ſufficient to make our orang-outang act ; but the baboon required a cudgel, and the other apes a whip ; for none of them would obey without blows. I have ſeen this animal preſent his hand to conduct the people who came to viſit him, and walk as gravely along with them as if he had formed a part oſ the company. I have ſeen him sit down at table, unfold his towel, wipe his lips, uſe a ſpoon or a fork to carry the victuals to his mouth, pour his liquor into a glaſs, and make it touch that of the perſon who drank along with him. When invited to take tea, he brought a cup and a ſaucer, placed them on the table, put in ſugar, poured out the tea, and allowed it to cool before he drank it. All theſe actions he performed without any other inſtigation than the ſigns or verbal orders of his maſter, and often of his own accord. He did no injury to any perſon : he even approached company with circumspection, and preſented himſelf as if he wanted to be careſſed. He was very fond oſ dainties, which every body gave him : And as his breaſt was diſeaſed, and he was afflicted with a teazing cough, this quantity of ſweetmeats undoubtedly contributed to ſhorten his life. He lived one ſummer in Paris, and died in London the following winter. He eat almoſt every thing ; but preferred ripe and dried fruits to all other kinds of food. He drank a little wane ; but ſpontaneouſly left it for milk, tea, or other mild liquors.” This was only two feet four inches high, and was a young one. There is great poſſibilſty that theſe animals may vary in ſize and in colour, ſome being covered with black, others with reddiſh hairs.— They are not the ſatyrs of the ancients ; which had tails<note anchored="true" n="7" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> Ælian gives them tails, <hi rend="italic">lib.</hi> xvi. c. 21.

Linnaeus’s</p><p><hi rend="italic">homo nocturnus,</hi> an animal of this kind, is unneceſſarily ſeparated from his s <hi rend="italic">imia ſatyrus.</hi></p><p>To enable the reader to form a judgment of this animal, which has ſo great a reſemblance to man, it may not be unacceptable to quote from Buffon the differences and conformities which make him approach or recede from the human ſpecies. “ He differs from man externally by the flatneſs of his noſe, by the ſhortneſs of his front, and by his chin, which is not elevated at the baſe. His ears are proportionally too large, his eyes too near each other, and the diſtance between his noſe and mouth is too great. Theſe are the only differences between the face of an orang-outang and that of a man. With regard to the body and members, the thighs are proportionally too ſhort, the arms too long, the fingers too ſmall, the palm of the hands too long and narrow, and the feet rather reſemble hands than the human foot. The male organs of generation differ not from thoſe of man, except that the prepuce has no frænum. The female organs are extremely ſimilar to thoſe of a woman.</p><p>“ The orang-outang differs internally from the human ſpecies in the number of ribs : man has only 12, but the orang-outang has 13. The vertebræ of the neck are alſo ſhorter, the bones of the pelvis narrow, the buttocks flatter, and the orbits of the eyes sunk deeper. He has no ſpinal proceſs on the firſt vertebra of the neck. The kidneys are rounder than thoſe of man, and the ureters have a different figure, as well as the bladder and gall bladder, which are narrower and longer than in the human ſpecies. All the other parts of the body, head, and members, both external and internal, ſo perfectly reſemble thoſe of man, that we cannot make the compariſon without being aſtoniſhed that ſuch a ſimilarity in ſtructure and organization ſhould not produce the ſame effects. The tongue, and all the organs of ſpeech, for example, are the ſame as in man ; and yet the orang-outang enjoys not the faculty of ſpeaking ; the brain has the ſame figure and proportions ; and yet he poſſesses not the power of thinking. Can there be a more evident proof than is exhibited in the orang-outang, that matter alone, though perfectly organized, can produce neither language nor thought, unleſs it be animated by a ſuperior principle ? Man and the orang-outang are the only animals who have buttocks and the calf of the legs, and who, of courſe, are formed for walking erect ; the only animals who have a broad cheſt, flat ſhoulders, and vertebræ of the ſame ſtructure ; and the only animals whoſe brain, heart, lungs, liver, ſpleen, ſtomach, and inteſtines, are perfectly ſimilar, and who have an appendix vermiformis, or blind-gut. In fine, the orang-outang has a greater reſemblance to man than even to the baboons or monkeys, not only in all the parts we have mentioned, but in the largeneſs of the face, the figure of the cranium, of the jaws, of the teeth, and of the other bones of the head<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0501.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0495"/>
and face, in the thickneſs of the fingers and thumb, the figure of the nails, and the number of vertebræ ; and, laſtly, in the conformity of the articulations, the magnitude and figure of the rotula, ſternum, &amp; c. Hence, as there is a greater ſimilarity between this animal and man, than between thoſe creatures which reſemble him moſt, as the Barbary ape, the baboon, and monkey, who have all been deſigned by the general name of <hi rend="italic">apes,</hi> the Indians are to be excuſed for associating him with the human ſpecies, under the denomination of <hi rend="italic">orang-outang,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">wild man.</hi> In fine, if there were a ſcale by which we could deſcend from human nature to that of the brutes, and if the eſſence of this nature conſiſted entirely in the form of the body, and depended on its organization, the orang-outang would approach nearer to man than any other animal. Placed in the ſecond rank oſ beings, he would make the other animals feel his ſuperiority, and oblige them to obey him. If the principle of imitation, by which he ſeems to mimic human actions, were a result of thought, this ape would be ſtill farther removed from the brutes, and have a greater affinity to man. But the interval which ſeparates them is immenſe. Mind, reflection, and language, depend not on figure or the organization of the body. Theſe are endowments peculiar to man. The orangoutang, though, as we have ſeen, he has a body, members, ſenſes, a brain, and a tongue, perfectly ſimilar to thoſe of man, neither ſpeaks nor thinks. Though he counterfeits every human movement, he performs no action that is characteriſtic of man, no action that has the ſame principle or the ſame deſign. With regard to imitation, which appears to be the moſt ſtriking character of the ape kind, and which the vulgar have attributed to him as a peculiar talent, before we decide, it is neceſſary to inquire whether this imitation be ſpontaneous or forced. Does the ape imitate us from inclination, or becauſe, without any exertion of the will, he feels the capacity of doing it ? I appeal to ail thoſe who have examined this animal without prejudice ; and I am convinced that they will agree with me, that there is nothing voluntary in this imitation. The ape, having arms and hands, uſes them as we do, but without thinking of us. The ſimilarity of his members and organs neceſſarily produces movements, and ſometimes ſucceſſions of movements, which reſemble ours. Being endowed with the human ſtructure, the ape muſt move like man ; but the ſame motions imply not that he acts from imitation. Two bodies which receive the ſame impulſe, two ſimilar pendulums or machines, will move in the ſame manner ; but theſe bodies or machines can never be ſaid to imitate each other in their motions.</p><p>The ape and the human body are two machines ſimilarly conſtructed, and neceſſarily move nearly in the same manner ; but parity is not imitation. The one depends on matter, and the other on mind. Imitation preſuppoſes the deſign of imitating. The ape is incapable of forming this deſign, which requires a train of thinking ; conſequently man, if he inclines, can imitate the ape ; but the ape cannot even incline to imitate man.”</p><p>3. Pongo, or Jocko, are conſidered as one ſpecies by Pennant and Gmelin. It inhabits the iſland of Java, and the interior parts of Guinea. Has no pouches within his cheeks, no tail, and no calloſities on the buttocks ; which laſt are plump and fleſhy. All the teeth are ſimilar to thoſe of man. The face is flat, naked, and tawny ; the ears, hands, feet, breaſt, and belly, are</p><p>likewiſe naked ; the hair of the head descends on both temples in the form of treſſes ; the hair on the back and loins is in ſmall quantities. It is five or six feet high, and walks always erect on the two hind feet. It has not been aſcertained whether the females, of this ſpecies or variety, are ſubject to periodical diſcharges; but analogy renders this almoſt unqueſtionable. This animal is, by Dr Gmelin, considered only as a variety of the orang-outang.</p><p>4. The great gibbon, long-armed ape, or ſimia lar, with a flat ſwarthy face ſurrounded with grey hairs : hair on the body black and rough ; buttocks bare ; nails on the hands flat ; on the feet long ; arms of a moſt disproportioned length, reaching quite to the ground when the animal is erect, its natural poſture ; of a hideous deformity.— Inhabits India, Malacca, and the Molucca iſles ; a mild and gentle animal ; grows to the height of four feet. The great black ape of Mangſi, a province in China, ſeems to be of this kind.</p><p>5. The leſſer gibbon, or ſimia lar minor, but is much leſs, being only about a foot and a half high ; the body and face are of a brown colour, reſembles the former. The ſimia lar argentea is probably a variety of this ſpecies.</p><p>6. The pigmy, or ſimia ſilvanus, has no tail ; the buttocks are naked ; the head roundiſh, and the arms ſhorter than the body. It inhabits Africa ; and is not uncommon in our exhibitions of animals ; is very tractable and good-natured, and was moſt probably the pigmy of the ancients. It abounds in Æthiopia, one feat of that imaginary nation ; was believed to dwell near the fountains of the Nile, whence it descended annually to make war on the cranes, <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> to ſteal their eggs, which the birds may be suppoſed naturally to defend ; whence the fiction of their combats.</p><p>7. The magot, ſimia inuus, or Barbary ape, has a long face, not unlike that of a dog ; canine teeth, long and ſtrong; cars like the human ; nails flat; buttocks bare; colour of the upper part of the body a dirty greeniſh brown ; belly, of a dull pale yellow ; grows to above the length of four feet.—They inhabit many parts of India, Arabia, and all parts of Africa except Egypt, where none oſ this genus are found. A few are found on the hill of Gibraltar, which breed there ; probably from a pair that had eſcaped from the town ; as they are not found in any other part of Spain.—They are very ill-natured, miſchievous, and fierce ; agreeing with the character of the ancient Cynocephali. They are a very common kind in exhibitions. By force of diſcipline they are made to play ſome tricks ; otherwiſe they are more dull and ſullen than the rest of this genus. They aſſemble in great troops in the open fields in India, and will attack women going to market, and take their proviſions from them. The females carry the young in their aims, and will leap from tree to tree with them. Apes were worſhipped in India, and had magnificent temples erected to them. When the Portugueſe plundered one in Ceylon, they found in a little golden caſket the tooth of an ape ; a relic held by the natives in ſuch veneration, that they offered 700,000 ducats to redeem it, but in vain ; for it was burnt by the viceroy, to ſtop the progreſs of idolatry.</p><p>II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Papiones,</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Baboons.</hi> Theſe have ſhort tails, a long face ; a broad high muzzle; longiſh dog-like tuſks, or canine teeth ; and naked calloſities on the buttocks. They are only found in the old world, and are the papiones and Κυνοχεϙαλα of the ancients.</p><p>8. The maimon, ſimia papio nemeſtrina, or pig-tailed<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0502.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0496"/>
baboon, with a pointed face, which is naked, of a swarthy redneſs ; two ſharp canine teeth ; ears like the human ; hair on the limbs and body brown inclining to aſh-colour, paleſt on the belly ; fingers black ; nails long and flat ; thumbs on the hind-feet very long, connected to the neareſt toe by abroad membrane; tail four inches long, ſlender, exactly like a pig’s, and almoſt naked ; the bare ſpaces on the rump red, and but ſmall : length, from head to tail, 22 inches. Inhabits the iſles of Sumatra and Japan ; is very docile. In Japan it is taught ſeveral tricks, and carried about the country by mountebanks. Kempfer was informed by one of theſe people, that the baboon he had was 102 years old.</p><p>9. The great baboon, or ſimia papio ſphinx, with hazel irides ; ears small and naked ; face canine, and very thick ; middle of the face and fore head naked ; and of a bright vermilion colour ; tip of the noſe of the ſame, and ending truncated like that of a hog; ſides of the noſe broadly ribbed, and of a fine violet hue ; the opening of the mouth very ſmall ; cheeks, throat, and goat-like beard yellow ; hair on the fore-head very long, turns back, is black, and forms a kind of pointed creſt. Head, arms, and legs, covered with ſhort hair, yellow and black intermixed ; the breaſt with long whitiſh yellow hairs, the ſhoulders with long brown hair. Nails fiat ; feet and hands black ; tail four inches long, and very hairy ; buttocks bare, red, and filthy ; but the ſpace about them is of a moſt elegant purple colour, which reaches to the inſide of the upper part of the thighs.</p><p>This was deſcribed by Mr Pennant from a ſtuffed ſpecimen in Sir Aſhton Lever’s muſeum. In Auguſt 1779, a live animal of this ſpecies was ſhown at Edinburgh, and in October following at Cheſter, where being ſeen by Mr Pennant, that inquiſitive naturaliſt has deſcribed it in his Hiſtory of Quadrupeds. “ It differed little (he obſerves) in colour from the above, being in general much darker. Eyes much ſunk in the head, and ſmall. On the internal ſide of each ear was a white line, pointing upwards. The hair on the fore-head turned up a like a toupee. Feet black ; in other reſpects reſembled the former. In this I had an opportunity of examining the teeth. The cutting teeth were like thoſe of the rest of the genus ; but, in the upper and lower jaw, were two canine, or rather tuſks, near three inches long, and exceedingly ſharp and pointed. This animal was five feet high, oſ a moſt tremendous ſtrength in all its parts ; was exceſſively fierce, libidinous, and ſtrong.”</p><p>Mr Schreber ſays, that this ſpecies lives on ſucculent fruits, and on nuts ; is very fond of eggs, and will put eight at once into its pouches, and, taking them out one by one, break them at the end, and ſwallow the yolk and white ; rejects all fleſh-meat, unleſs it be dreſſed ; would drink quantities of wine or brandy ; was leſs agile than other baboons ; very cleanly; for it would immediately fling its excrements out of its hut. That which was ſhown at Cheſter was particularly fond of cheeſe. Its voice was a kind of roar, not unlike that of a lion, but low and ſomewhat inward. It went upon all fours, and never ſtood on its hind legs, unleſs forced by the keeper ; but would frequently fit on its rump in a crouching manner, and drop its arms before the belly. Inhabits the hotter parts of Africa.</p><p>10. The little baboon, or ſimia papio apedia, has a roundiſh head, with a projecting muzzle, and roundiſh</p><p>naked ears ; the hair on the body is yellow, tipt with black ; the face is brown, and almoſt naked, having only a few ſcattered hairs ; the nails are all compreſſed and oblong, except on the thumbs and great toes, the nails of which reſemble man ; the tail is very ſhort, being hardly an inch long ; the body is about the size of a cat. It is uncertain, ſays Gmelin, if this animal ſhould be conſidered as a diſtinct ſpecies, or only as a variety of the ſimia ſciurea.</p><p>11. The mantegar, or ſimia papio mermon, commonly called the <hi rend="italic">tufted ape,</hi> but it is improperly named an <hi rend="italic">ape,</hi> as it has a tail. It is deſcribed in the abridgment of the Philoſophical Tranſactions, n⁰ 290. It had a noſe and head 14 inches in length ; the noſe of a deep red, lace blue, both naked ; black eye-brows ; ears like the human ; on the top of the head a long upright tuft of hair ; on the chin another ; two long tuſks in the upper jaw ; fore feet exactly reſembling hands, and the nails on the fingers flat ; the fore-part of the body, and the inside of the legs and arms, naked ; the outſide covered with mottled brown and olive hair. Length, from the noſe to the rump, three feet two inches. It was very fierce and ſalacious ; went on all fours, but would fit up on its rump, and ſupport itſelf with a ſtick ; in this attitude, it would hold a cup in its hand, and drink out of it. Its food was fruits.</p><p>12. The mandril, ſimia papio maimon, or ribbed noſe baboon, has a ſhort tail, and a thin beard on the chin ; the cheeks are blue and ſtriped, and the buttocks are naked. This ſpecies of baboon is found on the Gold Coaſt, and in the other southern provinces of Africa, where he is called <hi rend="italic">boggo</hi> by the negroes, and <hi rend="italic">mandril</hi> by the Europeans. Next to the orang-outang, he is the largeſt of all the apes or baboons. Smith relates, that he had a preſent of a female mandril, which was only six months old, and that it was as large as an adult baboon. He adds, that theſe mandrils walk always on two feet ; that they weep and groan like men ; that they have a violent paſſion for women, which they never fail to gratify when they find a woman at a diſtance from relief. We have given figures both of the male and female, which may be eaſily diſtinguiſhed by their ſize and appearance.</p><p>13. The wood-baboon, or ſimia papio sylvatica, with a long dog-like face, covered with a ſmall gloſſy black ſkin ; hands and feet naked, and black like the face ; hair on all parts long, elegantly mottled with black and tawny ; nails white : about three feet high when erect; tail not three inches, and very hairy on the upper top. Inhabits Guinea, where it is called by the Engliſh the <hi rend="italic">man oſ the woοd.</hi></p><p>14. The brown baboon, or ſimia papio platypygos, with pointed ears; face of a dirty white ; noſe large and broad; hairs round the face ſhort and ſtraight; colour of the upper part of the body brown ; of the under, aſh- colour : tail about four inches long ; taper, and almoſt bare of hair ; beneath is quite naked. The animal which Mr Pennant called the <hi rend="italic">new baboon,</hi> in the firſt edition, ſeems by the taperneſs of the tail, and general form, to be of this kind.</p><p>15. The hoggiſh baboon, or ſimia papio porcaria, has a ſhort tail, and coloured buttocks ; the head is like that of a hog, with a naked ſnout ; the body is of an olive brown colour ; the nails are ſharp and compreſſed. Inhabits Africa, and is about three feet and a half high<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0503.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0497"/>
when ſtanding erect. This, in all probability, is the ſame animal with the hog-faced ape, adopted from Pennant.</p><p>III. <hi rend="smallcaps">Monkeys, Cercopitheci,</hi> have long tails, which are not prehensile ; the under parts of their cheeks are furniſhed with pouches, in which they can keep their victuals ; the partition between the nostrils is thin, and the apertures are, like thoſe of man, placed in the under part of the noſe ; the buttocks are naked, and provided with calloſities. Theſe animals, which are never found native in America, are the cercopitheci, and Κυβοιof the ancients.</p><p>16. The Tartarin, dog faced baboon of Pennant, and cercopithecus hamadryas of Gmelin, with a long, thick, and ſtrong noſe, covered with a ſmooth red ſkin ; ears pointed, and hid in the hair ; head great, and flat ; hair on the head, and fore part of the body as far as the waiſt, very long and ſhaggy ; grey and olive-brinded ; the ſides oſ the head very full, the hair on the limbs and hind part of the body very ſhort; limbs ſtrong and thick ; hands and feet dusky ; the nails on the fore-feet flat ; thoſe on the hind like a dog’s ; buttocks very bare, and covered with a ſkin of a bloody colour ; tail ſcarce the length of the body, and carried generally erect. They inhabit the hotteſt parts of Africa and Alia ; where they keep in vaſt troops, and are very fierce and dangerous. They rob gardens. They will run up trees when paſſengers go by, ſhake the boughs at them with great fury, and chatter very loud. They are exceſſively impudent, indecent, laſcivious ; moſt deteſtable animals in their manners as well as appearance. They range the woods in hundreds ; which obliges the owners of the coffee-plantations to be continually on their guard againſt their depredations. One of them was ſhown in London ſome years ago : it came from Mokha, in the province of Yeman, in Arabia Felix in the Persian gulph ; and was above five feet high. It was very fierce and untameable ; ſo ſtrong as eaſily to maſter its keeper, a ſtout young man. Its inclinations to women appeared in the moſt violent manner. A footman, who brought a girl to ſee it, in order to teaze the animal, killed and hugged her : the beaſt, enraged at being ſo tantalized, caught hold of a quart pewter- pot, which he threw with such force and ſo ſure an aim, that, had not the man’s hat and wig ſoftened the blow, his skull muſt have been fractured ; but he fortunately eſcaped with a common broken head.</p><p>17. The white-bearded black wanderu, the ſimia ſilenus of Linnæus, the ouanderou of Buffon, and liontailed baboon of Pennant, the cercopithecus ſilenus albibarbatus of Gmelin, has a dog-like face, is naked, and of a duſky colour ; a very large and full white or hoary beard ; large canine teeth ; body covered with black hair ; belly of a light colour ; tail terminated with a tuft of hair like that of a lion. Its bulk that of a middling ſized dog. It inhabits the Eaſt Indies and the hotter parts of Africa.</p><p>18. The purple-faced monkey, or cercopithecus ſilenus purpuratus, with a great triangular white beard, ſhort and pointed at the bottom, and on each side of the ears, extending a winged faſhion far beyond them ; face and hands purple, body black. Inhabit Ceylon. They are very harmleſs ; live in the woods, and feed on leaves and buds of trees ; and when taken ſoon become tame.</p><p>19. Malbrouk, or cercopithecus faunus, has along tail, and is bearded ; the tail is buſhy at the extremity. It is a native of Bengal. This ſpecies has cheek- pouches, and calloſities on the buttocks ; the tail is nearly as long as the body and head ; and it is a mistake of Cluſius that it terminates in a tuft ; the face is oſ a cinereous grey colour, with a large muzzle, and large eyes, which have fleſh-coloured eyelids, and a grey band croſs the forehead in the place of eye-brows; the ears are large, thin, and fleſh-coloured ; the upper parts of the body are of a uniform yellowiſh brown colour, and the lower of a yellowiſh grey : It walks on all fours, and is about a foot and a half from the muzzle to the extremity of the tail. The females menſtruate.</p><p>20. Macaque, or cercopithecus cynomologus, the hare-lipped monkey of Pennant, has no beard ; the nostrils are thick and divided ; the tail is long and arched, and the buttocks are naked. He has cheek-pouches and calloſities on the buttocks. His tail is from 18 to 20 inches long. His head is large, his muzzle very thick, and his face naked, livid, and wrinkled. His ears are covered with hair. His body is ſhort and squat, and his limbs thick and ſhort. The hair on the superior parts of his body is of a greeniſh aſh-colour, and of a yellowiſh grey on the breaſt and belly. He has a ſmall creſt of hair on the top of the head. He walks on four and ſometimes on two feet. The length of his body, comprehending that of the head, is about 18 or 20 inches.</p><p>21. The dog-headed monkey, or cercopithecus cynocephalus, has no beard, and is of a yellow colour ; the muzzle is long ; the tail long and ſtraight, and the buttocks naked. It is a native of Africa.</p><p>22. The ſpotted monkey, or cercopſthecus Diana, with a long white beard : colour of the upper parts of the body reddiſh, as if they had been ſinged, marked with white ſpecks ; the belly and chin whitiſh ; tail very long ; is a ſpecies of a middle ſize. It inhabits Guinea and Congo, according to Marcgrave ; the Congeſe call it <hi rend="italic">exquima.</hi> M. de Buffon denies it to be of that country ; but from the circumſtance of the curl in its tail, in Marcgrave’s figure, and the deſcription of ſome voyagers, he ſuppoſes it to be a native of South America. Linnæus deſcribes his S. Diana ſomewhat differently : he says it is of the ſize of a large cat ; black, ſpotted with white ; hind part of the back ferruginous; face black ; from the top of the noſe is a white line paſſing over each eye to the ears, in an arched form ; beard pointed, black above, white beneath, placed on a fattiſh excreſcence ; breaſt and throat white ; from the rump, croſs the thighs, a white line ; tail long, ſtraight, and black ; ears and feet of the ſame colour ; canine teeth, large.</p><p>23. The green monkey, or cercopſthecus sabœus, has a black and flattiſh face : the side of it bounded by long white hairs, falling backwards, and almoſt covering the ears, which are black, and like the human : head, limbs, and whole upper part of the body and tail covered with ſoft hair, of a yellowiſh green colour at their ends, cinereous at their roots : underside of the body and tail, and inner fide of the limbs, of a ſilvery colour : tail very long and ſlender. Size of a ſmall cat. Inhabit different parts of Africa : keep in great flocks, and live in the woods : are ſcarce diſcernible when among the leaves, except by their breaking the boughs with their<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0504.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0498"/>
gambols ; in which they are very agile and silent : even when ſhot at, do not make the leaſt noiſe : but will unite in company, knit their brows, and gnaſh their teeth, as if they meant to attack the enemy : are very common in the Cape de Verd islands.</p><p>24. The muſtache, or cercopithecus cephus, has a beard on the cheeks ; the crown of the head is yellowiſh : the feet are black, and the tip of the tail is of an aſh colour. Its tail is much longer than the body and head, being 19 or 20 inches in length. The female menſtruates.</p><p>25. The mangabey, cercopithecus æthiops, or whiteeyed monkey, has a long, black, naked, and dog-like face : the upper eye-lids of a pure white : ears black, and like the human : no canine teeth : hairs on the ſides of the face beneath the cheeks, longer than the rest : tail long : colour of the whole body tawny and black : flat nails on the thumbs and fore-fingers ; blunt claws on the others : hands and feet black —Shown in London ſome years ago ; place uncertain : that deſcribed by M. de Buffon came from Madagaſcar ; was very good- natured ; went on all-fours.</p><p>26. The egret, or cercopithecus aygula, has a long face, and an upright fharp-pointed tuft of hair on the top of the head. The hair on the forehead is black : the tuft, and the upper part of the body light-grey ; the belly white : the eye-brows are large ; the beard very ſmall. Size of a ſmall cat. They inhabit Java. They fawn on men, on their own ſpecies, and embrace each other. They play with dogs, if they have none of their own ſpecies with them. If they ſee a monkey of another kind, they greet him with a thouſand grimaces. When a number of them sleep, they put their heads together. They make a continual noiſe during night.</p><p>27. The rillow, cercopithecus ſinicus, or Chineſe bonnet, has a long ſmooth noſe, of a whitiſh colour ; hair on the crown of the head long, lying flat, and parted like that of a man ; colour, a pale cinereous brown, Inhabit Ceylon. They keep in great troops ; and rob gardens of their fruit, and fields of their corn ; to prevent which, the natives are obliged to watch the whole day : yet theſe animals are ſo bold, that, when driven from one end of the field, they will immediately enter at the other, and carry off with them as much as their mouth and arms can hold. Boſman, ſpeaking of the thefts of the monkeys of Guinea, ſays, that they will take in each paw one or two ſtalks of millet, as many under their arms, and two or three in their mouth ; and thus laden, hop away on their hind-legs : but, if purſued, they fling away all, except what is in their mouths, that it may not impede their flight. They are very nice in the choice of the millet ; examine every ſtalk : and if they do not like it, fling it away : ſo that this delicacy does more harm to the fields than their thievery.</p><p>28. The tawny monkey, or cercopithecus fulvus, has long tuſks in the lower jaw : the viſage is long and fleſh coloured, with fleſh coloured ears, and a flattiſh noſe. Inhabits India. This is a very ill natured animal,</p><p>about the ſize of a cat ; it was lately in the poſſeſſion of Mr Brook, an animal merchant and exhibitor in London : The upper parts of the body are covered with a pale tawny coloured fur, which is aſh coloured at the roots ; the hinder part of the back is orange coloured, the legs aſh coloured, the belly white, and the tail ſhorter than the body.</p><p>29. King monkey, full-bottom monkey, or cercopi- thecus regalis, has no thumb on the hands ; the head, cheeks, throat, and shoulders, are covered with long, flowing, coarſe hairs. Inhabits the foreſts of Sierra Leona in Guinea, where it is called <hi rend="italic">bey,</hi> or king <hi rend="italic">monkey.</hi> It is above three feet high when erect ; The head is ſmall, with a ſhort, black, naked face ; and the head, cheeks, throat, neck, and ſhoulders, are covered with long, coarſe, flowing hairs, of a dirty yellowiſh colour, mixed with black, and reſembling a full-bottomed wig ; the body, arms, and legs, are covered with ſhort hairs of a fine gloſſy black colour ; the hands are naked, and have no thumbs ; the feet have five very long ſlender toes, which are armed with narrow pointed claws ; the tail is very long, and is covered with ſnow white hairs, having a tuft at the end ; the body and limbs are very ſlender ; Its ſkin is held in high eſtimation by the negroes for making pouches and gun cafes.</p><p>IV. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sapajous, Sapaji,</hi> have prehenſile tails, and no cheek-pouches. Theſe animals have long tails, which, at the extremity, is generally deprived of hair on the under side, and covered with a ſmooth ſkin ; this part they can fold, extend, curl up, and unfold at pleaſure ; by which they are enabled to hang upon branches, or to lay hold of any thing which is beyond the reach of their hands, uſing the extremity of the tail like a finger or hand ; the partition between the noſtrils is very thick, and the apertures are ſituated on the ſides of the noſe ; the buttocks are clothed with hair, and have no calloſities ; the females of this ſubgenus do not menſtruate ; and this race of animals is only to be found in America : This ſubdiviſion of the genus is made with great propriety by Dr Gmelin, in imitation of the Count de Buffon.</p><p>30. The guariba, ſapajus Beelzebub, or the preacher monkey, has black ſhining eyes ; ſhort round ears ; and a round beard under the chin and throat. The hairs on the body are of a ſhining black, long, yet lie ſo cloſe on each other that the animal appears quite ſmooth : the feet and end of the tail are brown ; the tail very long, and always twilled at the end. Size of a fox. Inhabit the woods of Brazil and Guiana in vaſt numbers, and make a moſt dreadful howling. Sometimes one mounts on a higher branch, the rest ſeat themſelves beneath : the firſt begins as if it was to harangue, and ſets up ſo loud and ſharp a howl as may be heard a vaſt way, and a perſon at a diſtance would think that a hundred joined in the cry : after a certain ſpace, he gives a ſignal with his hand, when the whole aſſembly joins in chorus ; but on another ſignal is silent, and the orator finiſhes his addreſs<note anchored="true" n="8" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi> A singular account, yet related by Marcgrave and ſeveral other writers.

which the Engliſh call the \ <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Theſe monkeys are very fierce, untameable, and bite dreadfully. There is a variety of a ferruginous or reddiſh bay colour, which the Indians call the <hi rend="italic">king of the monkeys :</hi> it is large, and as noiſy as the former. The natives eat this ſpecies, as well as ſeveral other forts of monkeys, but are particularly fond of this. Europeans will alſo eat it, eſpeciaHy in thoſe parts of America where food is ſcarce : when it is ſcalded in order to get off the hair, it looks very white ; and has a reſemblance ſhocking to humanity, that of a child of two or three years old when crying (c).</p><p>31. The quato, ſapajus paniſcus, or four-fingered monkey, has a long flat face, of a ſwarthy fleſh colour: the eyes are funk in the head ; ears like the human ; limbs of a great length, and uncommonly ſlender : the hair is black, long, and rough. There are only four ſingers on the hands, being quite deſtitute of a thumb ; five toes on the feet. The tail is long ; and naked below, near the end. The body is ſlender ; about a foot and a half long ; the tail near two feet, and ſo prehenſile as to ſerve every purpoſe of a hand. They inhabit the neighbourhood of Carthagena, Guiana, Braſil, and Peru ; aſſociate in vaſt herds ; and are ſcarce ever ſeen on the ground. Dampier deſcribes their gambols in a lively manner: “ There was (ſays he) a great company dancing from tree to tree over my head, chattering, and making a terrible noiſe and a great many grim fact's and antic geſtures ; ſome broke down dry sticks and flung them at me, others ſcattered their urine and dung about my ears : at laſt one bigger than the reſt came to a ſmall limb juft over my head, and leap, ing directly at me, made me leap back ; but the monkey caught hold of the bough with the tip of its tail, and there continued ſwinging to and fro, making mouths at me. The females with their young ones are much troubled to leap after the males ; for they have commonly two, one ſhe carries under her arm, the other fits on her back, and claps its two fore-paws about her neck : are very fallen when taken ; and very hard to be got when ſhot, for they will cling with their tail or feet to a bough as long as any life remains. When I have ſhot at one, and broke a leg or arm, I have pitied the poor creature to fee it look and handle the broken limb, and turn it from fide to fide.”—They are the moſt active of monkeys, and quite enliven the fo- reſts of America. In order to pass from top to top of lofty trees, whoſe branches are too diſtant for a leap, they will form a chain, by hanging down, linked to each other by their tails, and ſwinging in that manner till the loweſt catches hold of a bough of the next tree, and draws up the reſt ; and ſometimes they paſs rivers by the ſame expedient. They are ſometimes brought to Europe ; but are very tender, and ſeldom live long in our climate.</p><p>32. The ſai, ſapajus, capucinus, or weeper, with a round and flat face, of a reddiſh brown colour, very deformed : the hair on the head and upper part of the body black, tinged with brown ; beneath and on the</p><p>limbs tinged with red : tail black, and much longer than the head and body : the young exceſſively deformed ; their hair very long, and thinly diſperſed.—In the Bri- tiſh Muſeum are ſpecimens of old and young. M. de Buffon has a variety with a white throat. Inhabits Surinam and Braſil : appear as if it was always weeping ; of a melancholy diſpoſition ; but very full of imitating what it sees-done. Theſe probably are the monkeys Dampier ſaw in the Bay of All Saints, which he ſays are very ugly, and ſmell ſtrongly of muſk. They keep in large companies ; and make a great chattering, eſpeciaHy in ſtormy weather ; reſide much on a ſpecies of tree which bears a podded fruit, which they feed on.</p><p>33. Sapajus fatuellas, or horned ſapajou, has two tufts of hair on the head, reſembling little horns : Is beardleſs. Inhabits South America. The face, ſides, belly, and fore-parts of the thighs are brown ; the top of the head, middle of the back, tail, legs, and poſterior parts of the thighs, are black ; the nails are long and rather blunt ; the tail is prehenſile and twiſted ſpirally. Perhaps of the ſame ſpecies with the ſimia apella or capuchin (Gm.). This, in all probability, is one of the factitious ſpecies, purpoſely deformed, by exhibitors of wild beaſts, to impoſe on the public.</p><p>34. Saimiri, ſapajus ſciureus, or orange monkey, has no beard ; the hinder part of the head is prominent ; and the nails on the four toes of the hind paws are narrow and pointed. It inhabits South America, and is the moſt beautiful of all the ſapajous ; its movements are graceful ; its ſize ſmall ; its colour a brilliant yellow ; its viſage round, with large vivacious eyes, ſurrounded by ſteſh-coloured rings ; it has hardly any forehead ; the noſe is elevated at the baſe, and flattened at the point : the mouth is ſmall, the face flat and naked, and the ears are garniſhed with hair, and a little pointed ; the tail is only half prehenſile : It ſtands with eaſe on two feet, but commonly walks on all four.</p><p>V. <hi rend="smallcaps">Sagoins, Sagoini.</hi> Theſe have long tails, which are proportionally longer than thoſe of the ſapajous, ſtraight, flaccid, entirely covered with hair, and not prehenſile ; that is, incapable of laying hold of any object : the cheeks have no pouches ; and the buttocks, which are covered with hair, have no calloſitres : the partition between the noſtrils is very thick, and the apertures are placed on the ſides of the nose. The females do not menſtruate. This race of animals is only found in America.</p><p>35. The ſaki, ſagoinus pithecia, or fox-tailed monkey, with a ſwarthy face, covered with ſhort white down : forehead and ſides of the face with whitiſh, and pretty long hair : body with long duſky brown hairs ; white or yellowiſh at their tips : hair on the tail very long and buſhy ; ſometimes black, iometimes reddish : belly and lower part of the limbs a reddiſh white : length from noſe to tail near a foot and a half : tail longer, and like that of a fox : hands and feet black, with claws inſtead of nails.

Pinche, ſagoinus oedipus, or red-tailed monkey, is beardleſs ; has a flowing head of hair, which hangs down on each side ; a red tail and ſharp claws. It has neither cheek-pouches nor calloſities on the buttocks. His tail is not prehenſile, and is more than twice the length of the head and body. The partition of the noſtrils is thick, and the apertures are placed at a side. The face, throat, and ears are black ; on the head are long white hairs. The muzzle is broad, and the face round. The hair on the body is pretty long; of a yellowish brown or reddiſh colour till near the tail, where it becomes orange; on the breaſt, belly, hands, and feet, it is white, and ſhorter than on the body. The tail, ſrom the origin to one-half of its length, is a vivid red, then browniſh red, and toward the point it is black. He is about nine inches in length, and walks on four feet. The females are not ſubject to the menſtrual evacuation.</p><p>38. The marikina, ſagoinus roſalius, or ſilky monkey, is beardleſs ; has a very hairy head : the circumference of the face and the feet are red ; and the claws are ſharp and narrow. It inhabits South America. A briſk animal, leſs impatient of cold than the rest of this race : the body is of a yellowiſh white colour ; the nails on the thumbs and great toes are rounded ; the ears are naked, but are hidden beneath the fur : It has a round head, and a brown face, which is ſurrounded with a kind of mane of a bright red colour ; the hair on the body and tail is long, ſilky, and of a pale but vivid yellow colour, almoſt white, with a conſiderable tuft at the extremity of the tail. It walks on four feet, and is eight or nine inches in length, ſrom the muzzle to the rump ; and the tail is above 13 inches long. This ſpecies has the ſame manners and vivacity with the other ſagoins, but is more robuſt in conſtitution, as an individual lived five or six years in Paris, being kept in a warm room during winter.</p><p>39. The mico, ſagoinus argenteus, or fair monkey, with a ſmall round head : face and ears of the moſt lively vermilion colour : body covered with moſt beautiful long hairs of a bright and silvery whiteneſs, of matchleſs elegance : tail of a ſhining dark cheſnut : head and body eight inches long; tail 12.
