        <p><span class="font3">by the prosperous condition of the empire for a century I and a half
                after his death.@@<sup>1</sup> To secure the peace which </span><span class="font1"
                >∣</span><span class="font3">&nbsp;the distracted Roman world desired, it was
                imperatively&nbsp;necessary to establish on all sides of the empire
                really&nbsp;defensible frontiers ; and this became possible now that&nbsp;for the
                first time the direction of the foreign policy of the&nbsp;state and of its military
                forces was concentrated in the&nbsp;hands of a single magistrate. To the south and
                west the&nbsp;generals of the republic, and Cæsar himself, had extended&nbsp;the
                authority of Rome to the natural boundaries formed&nbsp;by the African deserts and
                the Atlantic Ocean, and in&nbsp;these two directions Augustus’s task was in the main
                confined to the organization of a settled Roman government&nbsp;within these limits.
                In Africa the client state of Egypt&nbsp;was formed into a separate province, and
                the kingdom&nbsp;of Numidia (25 </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font3"> was incorporated
                with the old&nbsp;province of Africa. In Spain the hill-tribes of the northwest were
                finally subdued, and a third province, Lusitania,&nbsp;established.@@<sup>2</sup>
                Until the commencement of Cæsar’s campaigns (58 B.c.) Roman rule in Gaul had been
                confined to&nbsp;the single southern province of Gallia Narbonensis (121—&nbsp;118
                B.c.). Cæsar subdued the rest of the country, but the&nbsp;fierce struggles of the
                Civil AVar and his early death&nbsp;obliged him to leave to his nephew the task of
                organizing&nbsp;the conquered territory. Augustus (27 </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font3">
                established&nbsp;in addition to the “ old province ” the three new ones
                of&nbsp;Aquitania, Lugdunensis, and Belgica.@@<sup>3</sup> Towards the
                north&nbsp;the republic had left the civilized countries bordering on&nbsp;the
                AIediterranean with only a very imperfect defence&nbsp;against the threatening mass
                of barbarian tribes above&nbsp;them. The result@@<sup>4</sup> of Augustus’s policy
                was to establish a&nbsp;protecting line of provinces running from the Euxine
                to&nbsp;the North Sea, and covering the peaceful districts to
                the&nbsp;south,—AIoesia (6 </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.),</span><span class="font3"> Pannonia (9
                </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.),</span><span
                class="font3"> Noricum&nbsp;(15 </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.),</span><span class="font3"> Rætia (15
                </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.),</span><span
                class="font3"> and Gallia Belgica. Roman&nbsp;rule was thus carried up to the
                natural frontier lines of the&nbsp;Rhine and the Danube. Here, after the defeat of
                Varus&nbsp;(9 </span><span class="font0">A.D.) </span><span class="font3">and the
                abandonment of a forward policy beyond the Rhine, Augustus fixed the limits of the
                empire&nbsp;northward; his successor Tiberius recalled Germanicus,&nbsp;as soon as
                the disaster in the Silva Teutoburgensis had&nbsp;been avenged ; and after the peace
                with AIaroboduus, the&nbsp;chief of the Alarcomanni on the upper Danube, in
                the&nbsp;next year (17 </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >a.d.),</span><span class="font3"> the defensive policy recommended by&nbsp;Augustus
                was adopted along the whole of the northern&nbsp;frontier. The line of the great
                rivers was held by an&nbsp;imposing mass of troops. Along the Rhine lay the
                armies&nbsp;of Upper and Lower Germany, consisting of four legions&nbsp;each; eight
                more guarded the Danube and the frontiers of&nbsp;Pannonia and Alœsia. The command
                of the troops was&nbsp;entrusted to imperial legates, whose posts became the
                most&nbsp;coveted prizes in the imperial service, and were not&nbsp;Unfrequently
                stepping-stones to the imperial purple itself.&nbsp;At frequent intervals along the
                frontier were the military&nbsp;colonies, the permanent camps, and the smaller
                intervening&nbsp;“castella.” Flotillas of galleys cruised up and down
                the&nbsp;rivers, and Roman roads opened communication both along&nbsp;the frontiers
                and with the seat of government in Italy.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">In the East Rome had other work to do than that of erecting a barrier
                against a surging tide of barbarism, for&nbsp;here she was confronted with a
                well-organized and&nbsp;powerful state whose claims to empire were second only
                to&nbsp;her own. The conquests of Pompey (66-G2 </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font3"> had&nbsp;brought
                Rome face to face with Parthia on the banks of&nbsp;the Euphrates, the limits of
                Roman authority being&nbsp;marked by the eastern frontiers of the client states
                of</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">Pontus, Cappadocia, and Commagene, and of the newly formed province
                of Syria. In 54 the rash advance of&nbsp;Crassus beyond the Euphrates provoked the
                first serious&nbsp;collision between Rome and Parthia, and the victory
                at&nbsp;Carrhæ encouraged among the Parthians the idea of an&nbsp;invasion of Syria
                and Asia AIinor, while it awakened in&nbsp;Rome a genuine fear of the formidable
                power which had&nbsp;so suddenly arisen in the East. Cæsar was at the moment&nbsp;of
                his death preparing to avenge the death of Crassus by&nbsp;an invasion of Parthia,
                and Antony’s schemes of founding&nbsp;an Eastern empire which should rival that of
                Alexander&nbsp;included the conquest of the kingdom beyond the&nbsp;Euphrates. But
                on the Euphrates, as on the Rhine and&nbsp;the Danube, Augustus adhered to the
                policy which he&nbsp;recommended to his successors of “keeping the
                empire&nbsp;within its bounds”; and the Parthians, weakened by&nbsp;internal feuds
                and dynastic quarrels, were in no mood for&nbsp;vigorous action. Roman pride was
                satisfied by the&nbsp;restoration of the standards taken at Carrhæ.
                Four&nbsp;legions guarded the line of the Euphrates, and, beyond&nbsp;the frontiers
                of Pontus and Cappadocia, Armenia was&nbsp;established as a “friendly and
                independent ally.”@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">Next in importance to the rectification and defence of the frontiers
                was the reformation of the administration, and the restoration of prosperity to the
                distracted&nbsp;and exhausted provinces. The most serious defect of&nbsp;the
                republican system had been the absence of any&nbsp;effective contral control over
                the Roman officials outside&nbsp;Italy. This was now supplied by the general
                proconsular&nbsp;authority vested in the emperor. The provinces were for&nbsp;the
                first time treated as departments of a single state, while&nbsp;their governors,
                from being independent and virtually irresponsible rulers, became the subordinate
                officials of a higher&nbsp;authority.@@<sup>6</sup> Over the “legati” and
                “procurators” of the&nbsp;imperial provinces the control of the emperor was as
                complete as that of the republican proconsul over his staff in his&nbsp;own
                province. They were appointed by him, held office at&nbsp;his good pleasure, and
                were directly responsible to him for&nbsp;their conduct. The proconsuls of the
                senatorial provinces&nbsp;were in law magistrates equally with the princeps,
                though&nbsp;inferior to him in rank ; it was the senate that they&nbsp;were as of
                old responsible; they were still selected by&nbsp;lot from among the senators of
                consular and prætorian&nbsp;rank. But the distinction did not seriously interfere
                with&nbsp;the paramount authority of the emperor. The provinces&nbsp;left nominally
                to the senate were the more peaceful and&nbsp;settled districts in the heart of the
                empire, where only the&nbsp;routine work of civil administration was needed, and
                where&nbsp;the local municipal governments were as yet comparatively vigorous. The
                senatorial proconsuls themselves&nbsp;were indirectly nominated by the emperor
                through his&nbsp;control of the prætorship and consulship. They wielded&nbsp;no
                military and only a strictly subordinate financial authority, and, though Augustus
                and Tiberius, at any rate,&nbsp;encouraged the fiction of the responsibility of the
                senatorial&nbsp;governors to the senate, it was in reality to the emperor&nbsp;that
                they looked for direction and advice, and to him that&nbsp;they were held
                accountable. Moreover, in the case of all&nbsp;governors this accountability became
                under the empire a reality. Prosecutions for extortion (“de pecuniis
                repetundis”),&nbsp;which were now transferred to the hearing of the senate,&nbsp;are
                tolerably frequent during the first century of the&nbsp;empire ; but a more
                effective check on maladministration&nbsp;lay in the appeal to Cæsar from the
                decisions of any</span></p>
