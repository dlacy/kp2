Although Henry the French king in ſome meaſure protected him, the persecution of theſe divines rendered him ſo unhappy, not to mention the expence and loss of time which an almoſt: constant attendance at court unavoidably occasioned, that in 1552 he abandoned his country and went to Geneva. Here he embraced the Proteſtant religion, and thus juſtified in ſome meaſure the ſuſpicions of his theological enemies. It has been affirmed by ſeveral writers that he carried along with him the royal types, and the moulds alſo in which they were caſt ; but it is certain that he never afterwards made uſe of thoſe types. Beſides, is it poſſible that the author of ſo daring a theft could have been not only protected in Geneva, but even courted and honoured by the moſt eminent men of the age ? Is it credible that ſuch a crime could have been concealed for 60 years; or that Henry, the ſon and heir of the perpetrator, would have enjoyed the favour of the French king, if Robert Stephens had acted ſuch a ſhameful part ? If he was burnt in effigy at Paris, it was not for theft, but for having changed his religion. After his arrival at Geneva, he publiſhed an account of the diſpute between him and the Paris divines, which does as much honour to his abilities as his <hi rend="italic">Theſaurus</hi> does to his learning. He died in 1559, after a life of the moſt extraordinary induſtry. The books of which be was the editor were not fewer than 360. Many of them were ancient claſſics in different languages. Several were accompanied with annotations which he collected, and all of them were corrected by collating manuſcripts. He was ſo anxious to attain perfect accuracy, that he uſed to expoſe his proofs in public, and reward thoſe who diſcovered a miſtake. His books consequently were very correct. It is ſaid that his New Teſtament, called O<hi rend="italic"> Mirisicam</hi> (becauſe the preface begins with theſe words), has not a ſingle fault.</p><p>It was Robert Stephens who first divided the New Teſtament into verſes during a journey between Paris and Lyons. The advantages of this improvement are fully counterbalanced by its defects. It has destroyed the unity of the books, and induced many commentators to conſider every verſe as a diſtinct and independent aphoriſm. To this in ſome meaſure is to be aſcribed the many abſurd interpretations and creeds that have been forced out of that book.</p><p>By his laſt will his eſtate was left exclusively to ſuch of his children as ſhould ſettle at Geneva. He left behind him three ſons, Henry, Robert, and Francis.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Charles Stephens,</hi> the third ſon of Henry, was, like the rest of his family, familiarly acquainted with the learned languages. This recommended him to Lazarus de Baif, who made him tutor to his ſon, and in 1540 carried him along with him to Germany. He studied medicine, and practiſed it with ſucceſs in France. He did not, however, forſake the profeſſion of his family, but exerciſed it in Paris, where he became the editor of many books remarkable for neatneſs and elegance. He wrote above thirty treatiſes on different ſubjects, particularly on botany, anatomy, and hiſtory. He died in 1564.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Robert Stephens,</hi> the ſon of Robert the firſt of that name, did not accompany his father to Geneva, but continued to profeſs the Catholic religion, and to reſide at Paris, His letter was remarkably beautiful.— He was made king’s printer, and died about 1589.</p><p>His brother <hi rend="smallcaps">Francis</hi> was alſo a printer. He embraced the Proteſtant religion, and reſided at Geneva.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Henry Stephens,</hi> the remaining ſon of Robert, was born at Paris in 1528. He became the moſt learned and moſt celebrated of all his family. From his very birth almoſt he gave proofs of uncommon abilities, and diſplayed an ardent paſſion for knowledge. The Medea of Euripides, which he ſaw acted while at ſchool, first kindled his love for poetry, and inſpired him with the deſtre of acquiring the language in which that tragedy is written. He intreated his father not to condemn him to ſtudy Latin, which he already underſtood from converſation, but to initiate him at once into the knowledge of Greek. His father willingly granted his requeſt ; and Henry applied with ſuch vigour, that in a ſhort time he could repeat the Medea by heart. He afterwards studied Greek under Peter Daneſius, who was tutor to the Dauphin, and finally heard the lectures of Tuſanus and Turnebus. He became eager at an early age to underſtand aſtrology, and accordingly attended a profeſſor of that mysterious art ; but he was not long in diſcovering its abſurdity. At 19 he began his travels, which he undertook in order to examine foreign libraries, and to become acquainted with learned men. He ſpent two years in Italy, and returned into France completely maſter of Italian, and bringing along with him copies of ſeveral ſcarce authors, particularly a part of Anacreon, which before was thought lost.</p><p>He found his father publiſhing an edition of the New Teſtament, to which he prefixed ſome Greek verſes.— Soon after, he viſited England and the Netherlands, where he met with John Clement, an Engliſhman, to whom he was indebted for the remaining odes of Anacreon. During this journey he learned the Spaniſh language, which was very much ſpoken at that time in the Low Countries.</p><p>Whether Henry accompanied his father to Geneva or not is uncertain ; at leaſt he muſt have returned immediately to France, for we find him ſoon after eſtabliſhed at Paris, and publiſhing the odes of Anacreon. In 1554 he went to Rome, and thence to Naples. This journey was undertaken at the requeſt, and in the ſervice, of the French government. He was diſcovered, and would have been arreſted as a ſpy, had he not by his addreſs and ſkill in the language of the country been able to paſs himſelf for a native of Italy. On his return to France he aſſumed the title of printer to Ulric Fugger, a very rich and learned German nobleman, who allowed him a conſiderable penſion.</p><p>In 1560 he married a relation, as is generally ſuppoſed, of Henry Scrimigeour, a Scotch nobleman, with whom he was intimately acquainted. She was a woman, as he himſelf informs us, endowed with the nobleſt ſpirit and the moſt amiable dispositions. Her death, which happened in 1566, brought on a diseaſe that had twice attacked him before. It was a diſguſt at all thoſe purſuits which had formerly charmed him, an averſion to reading and the sight of books. It was probably occaſioned by too conſtant and severe an application to literary purſuits. In 1572 he publiſhed his <hi rend="italic">Theſaurus Lingua Græcœ·,</hi> one of the greateſt works, perhaps, that ever was executed by one man, if we conſi-</p></body></text></TEI>
