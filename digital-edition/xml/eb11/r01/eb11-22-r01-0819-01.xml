                <p><label>RAILWAYS</label>. Railways had their origin in the tramways ( <hi
                        rend="italic"> q. v.</hi> ) or wagon-ways which at least as early as the
                    middle of the 16th century were used in the mineral districts of England round
                    Newcastle for the conveyance of coal from the pits to the river Tyne for
                    shipment. It may be supposed that originally the public roads, when worn by the
                    cartage of the coal, were repaired by laying planks of timber at the bottom of
                    the ruts, and that then the planks were laid on the surface of special roads or
                    ways <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> “ Another
                        thing that is remarkable is their way-leaves; for, when men have pieces of
                        ground between the colliery and the river, they sell leave to lead coals
                        over their ground ” (Roger North). </note> formed between the collieries and
                    the river. “ The manner of the carriage, ” says Lord Keeper North in 1676, “ is
                    by laying rails of timber... exactly straight and parallel, and bulky carts are
                    made with four rowlets fitting these rails, whereby the carriage is so easy that
                    one horse will draw down four or five chaldrons of coals ” (from 10∙6 to 13∙2
                    tons). The planks were of wood, often beech, a few inches wide, and were
                    fastened down, end to end, on logs of wood, or “ sleepers, ” placed crosswise at
                    intervals of two or three feet. In time it became a common practice to cover
                    them with a thin sheathing or plating of iron, in order to add to their life;
                    this expedient caused more wear on the wooden rollers of the wagons, and,
                    apparently towards the middle of the 18th century, led to the introduction of
                    iron wheels, the use of which is recorded on a wooden railway near Bath in 1734.
                    But the iron sheathing was not strong enough to resist buckling under the
                    passage of the loaded wagons, and to remedy this defect the plan was tried of
                    making the rails wholly of iron. In 1767 the Colebrookdale Iron Works cast a
                    batch of iron rails or plates, each 3 ft. long and 4 in. broad, having at the
                    inner side an upright ledge or flange, 3 in. high at the centre and tapering to
                    a height of 2½ in. at the ends, for the purpose of keeping the flat wheels on
                    the track. Subsequently, to increase the strength, a similar flange was added
                    below the rail. Wooden sleepers continued to be used, the rails being secured by
                    spikes passing through the extremities, but about 1793 stone blocks also began
                    to be employed—an innovation associated with the name of Ben-jamin Outram, who,
                    however, apparently was not actuaIly the first to make it. This type of rail
                    (fig. 1) was known as the plate-rail, tramway-plate or barrow-way-plate—names
                    which are preserved in the modern term “ platelayer ” applied to the men who lay
                    and maintain the permanent way of a</p>
               <p>railway.</p>
               <p>Another form of rail, distinguished as the edge-rail, was first used on a line
                    which was opened between Loughborough and Nanpantan in 1789. This line was
                    originally designed as a “ plate-way ” on the Outram system, but objections were
                    raised to rails with upstanding ledges or flanges being laid on the turnpike
                    road which was crossed at Loughborough on the level. In other cases this
                    difficulty was overcome by paving or “ causewaying ” the road up to the level of
                    the top of the flanges, but</p>
               <p>on this occasion William Jessop, of the Butterley Iron Works, near Derby,
                    proposed to get over it by laying down two plates of iron, perfectly flat and
                    level with the road but each having on its outside a groove ¾ in. wide and ¾ in.
                    deep to control extra guiding wheels which were to be of somewhat larger
                    diameter than the bearing wheels and to be affixed to them. The rest of the line
                    was laid with what were substantially plate-rails placed on their edge instead
                    of flat. These were cast in 3 ft. lengths, of a double-flanged section, and for
                    the sake of strength they were “ fish-bellied ” or deeper in the middle than at
                    the ends. At one end of each rail the flange spread out to form a foot which
                    rested on a cross sleeper, being secured to the latter by a spike passing
                    through a central hole, and above this foot the rail was so shaped as to form a
                    socket into which was fitted the end of the next rail. Each length was thus
                    fastened to a sleeper at one end, while at the other it was socketed into the
                    end of its fellow. This method, however, was not found satisfactory: the
                    projecting feet were liable to be broken off, and in 1799 or 1800 Jessop
                    abandoned them, using instead separate cast-iron sockets or chairs, which were
                    fastened to the sleepers and in which the rails were supported in an upright
                    position. In the first instance he proposed to place the guiding wheels outside
                    the bearing wheels, and the Nanpantan line was laid on this plan with a width of
                    5 ft. between the guide wheels; but before it was opened he decided not only to
                    cast the guiding wheels and bearing wheels in one piece but also to put the
                    former inside the rails, arguing that with this arrangement the edge-rails
                    themselves would keep the wheels in position on the axles, whereas with that
                    first contemplated fastenings would have been required for them (fig. 2). Jessop
                    thus produced what was virtually the flanged wheel of to-day, having the flanges
                    inside the rails, and further, it is said, established what has become the
                    standard gauge of the world, 4 ft. 8½ in., or 5 ft. minus the width of two of
                    his rails.</p>
               <p>These two systems of constructing railways— the plate-rail and the
                    edge-rail—continued to exist side by side until well on in the 19th century.</p>
               <p>In most parts of England the plate-rail was preferred, and it was used on the
                    Surrey iron railway, from Wandsworth to Croydon, which, sanctioned by parliament
                    in 1801, was finished in 1803, and was the first railway available to the public
                    on payment of tolls, previous lines having all been private and reserved
                    exclusively for the use of their owners.</p>
               <p>In South Wales again, where in 1811 the railways in connexion with canals,
                    collieries and iron and copper works had a total length of nearly 150 miles, the
                    plate-way was almost universal. But in the north of England and in Scotland the
                    edge-rail was held in greater favour, and by the third decade of the century its
                    superiority was generally established. The manufacture of the rails them-selves
                    was gradually improved. By making them in longer lengths a reduction was
                    effected in the number of joints— always the weakest part of the line; and
                    another advance consisted in the substitution of wrought iron for cast iron,
                    though that material did not gain wide adoption until after the patent for an
                    improved method of rolling rails granted in 1820 to John Birkinshaw, of the
                    Bedlington Ironworks, Durham. His rails were wedge-shaped in section, much wider
                    at the top than at the bottom, with the inter-mediate portion or web thinner
                    still, and he recommended that they should be made 18 ft. long, even suggesting
                    that several of them might be welded together end to end to form considerable
                    lengths. They were supported on sleepers by chairs at intervals of 3 ft., and
                    were fish-bellied between the points of support. As used by George Stephenson on
                    the Stockton &amp; Darlington and Whitstable &amp; Canterbury lines they
                    weighed 28 ℔ per yard. On the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway they were
                    usually 12 ft. or 15 ft. long and weighed 35 ℔ to the yard, and they were
                    fastened by iron wedges to chairs weighing 15 or 17 ℔ each. The chairs were</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0820" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0845.jp2"/>
               <p>in turn fixed to the sleepers by two iron spikes, half-round wooden cross
                    sleepers being employed on embankments and stone blocks 20 in. square by 10 in.
                    deep in cuttings. The fish-bellied rails, however, were found to break near the
                    chairs, and from 1834 they began to be replaced with parallel rails weighing 50
                    lb to the yard.</p>
               <p>The next important development in rail design originated in America, which, for
                    the few lines that had been laid up to 1830, remained content with wooden bars
                    faced with iron. In that year Robert Livingston Stevens (1787-1856), devised for
                    the Camden &amp; Amboy railway a rail similar as to its top to those in use
                    in England, but having a flat base or foot by which it was secured to the
                    sleepers by hook-headed spikes, without chairs (fig. 3); he had to get the first
                    lot of these rails, which were 15 ft. long and weighed 36 ℔ to the yard,
                    manufactured in England, since there were then no mills in America able to roll
                    them. This type, which is often known as the Vignoles rail, after Charles
                    Blacker Vignoles (1793-1875), who re-invented it in England in 1836, is in
                    general use in America and on the continent of Europe. The bridge-rail (fig.
                    4)—so called because it was</p>
               <p>first laid on bridges—was supported on continuous longitudinal sleepers and held
                    down by bolts passing through the flanges, and was employed by I. K. Brunel on
                    the Great Western railway, where, however, it was abandoned after the line was
                    converted from broad to standard gauge in 1892. In the double-headed rail (fig.
                    5), originated by Joseph Locke in 1837, and first laid on the Grand Junction
                    railway, the two tables were equal. This rail was more easily rolled than
                    others, and, being reversible, was in fact two rails in one. But as it was laid
                    in cast-iron chairs the lower table was exposed to damage under the hammering of
                    the traffic, and thus was liable to be rendered useless as a running surface. In
                    consequence the bull-headed rail (fig. 6)</p>
               <p>was evolved, in which the lower table was made of smaller size and was intended
                    merely as a support, not as a surface to be used by the wheels. There was a
                    waste of metal in these early rails owing to the excessive thickness of the
                    vertical web, and subsequent improvements have consisted in adjusting the
                    dimensions so as to combine strength with economy of metal, as well as in the
                    substitution of steel for wrought iron (after the introduction of the Bessemer
                    process) and in minute attention to the composition of the steel employed.</p>
               <p>It was found, naturally, that the rails would not rest in their chairs at the
                    joints, but were loosened and bruised at the ends by the blows of the traffic.
                    The fish-joint was therefore devised in 1847 by W. Bridges Adams, the intention
                    being by “ fishing ” the joints to convert the rails into continuous beams. In
                    the original design two chairs were placed, one under each rail, a few inches
                    apart, as in fig. 7. The joint was thus suspended between the two chairs, and
                    two keys of iron, called “ fishes, ” fitting the side channels of the rails,
                    were driven in on each side between the chairs and the rails. In subse-quent
                    modifications the fishes were, as they continue to be, bolted to and through the
                    rails, the sleepers being placed rather further apart and the joint being
                    generally suspended between them.</p>
               <p>The iron tramway or railway had been known for half a century and had come into
                    considerable use in connexion with collieries and quarries before it was
                    realized that for the carriage</p>
               <p>of general merchandise it might prove a serious competitor to the canals, of
                    which a large mileage had been constructed in Great Britain during that period.
                    In the article on “Railways” in the Supplement to the <hi rend="italic">Encyclopaedia Britannica,</hi> published in 1824, it is said: “It will
                    appear that this species of inland carriage [railways] is principally applicable
                    where trade is considerable and the length of conveyance short; and is chiefly
                    useful, therefore, in transporting the mineral produce of the kingdom from the
                    mines to the nearest land or water communication, whether sea, river or canal.
                    Attempts have been made to bring it into more general use, but without success;
                    and it is only in particular circumstances that navigation, with the aid either
                    of locks or inclined planes to surmount the elevations, will not present a more
                    convenient medium for an extended trade. ” It must be remembered, however, that
                    at this time the railways were nearly all worked by horse-traction, and that the
                    use of steam had made but little progress. Richard Trevithick, indeed, had in
                    1804 tried a high-pressure steam Iocomotive, with smooth wheels, on a plate-way
                    near Merthyr Tydvil, but it was found more expensive than horses; John
                    Blenkinsop in 1811 patented an engine with cogged wheel and rack-rail which was
                    used, with commercial success, to convey coal from his Middleton colliery to
                    Leeds; William Hedley in 1813 built two locomotives—Puffing Billy and Wylam
                    Dilly—for hauling coal from Wylam Colliery, near Newcastle; and in the following
                    year George Stephenson’s first engine, the Blucher, drew a train of eight loaded
                    wagons, weighing 30 tons, at a speed of 4 m. an hour up a gradient of 1 in 450.
                    But, in the words of the same article, “ This application of steam has not yet
                    arrived at such perfection as to have brought it into general use. ”</p>
               <p>The steam locomotive, however, and with it the railways, soon began to make
                    rapid progress. On the Stockton &amp; Darlington railway, which was
                    authorized by parliament in 1821, animal power was at first proposed, but on the
                    advice of Stephenson, its engineer, steam-engines were adopted. This line, with
                    three branches, was over 38 m. in length, and was in the first instance laid
                    with a single track, passing-places being provided at intervals of a quarter of
                    a mile. At its opening, on the 27th of September 1825, a train of thirty-four
                    vehicles, making a gross load of about 90 tons, was drawn by one engine driven
                    by Stephenson, with a signalman on horse-back in advance. The train moved off at
                    the rate of from 10 to 12 m. an hour, and attained a speed of 15 m. an hour on
                    favourable parts of the line. A train weighing 92 tons could be drawn by one
                    engine at the rate of 5 m. an hour. The principal business of the new railway
                    was the conveyance of minerals and goods, but from the first passengers insisted
                    upon being carried, and on the 10th of October 1825 the company began to run a
                    daily coach, called the “ Experiment, ’’ to carry six inside, and from fifteen
                    to twenty outside, making the journey from Darlington to Stockton and back in
                    two hours. The fare was 1s., and each passenger was allowed to take baggage not
                    exceeding 14 ℔ weight. The rate for carriage of merchandise was reduced from 5d.
                    to one-fifth of a penny per ton per mile, and that of minerals from 7d. to 1½d.
                    per ton per mile. The price of coals at Darlington fell from 18s. to 8s. 6d. a
                    ton.</p>
               <p>The example of the Stockton &amp; Darlington line was followed by the
                    Monklands railway in Scotland, opened in 1826, and several other small
                    lines—including the Canterbury &amp;</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0821" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0846.jp2"/>
               <p>Whitstable, worked partly by fixed engines and partly by locomotives—quickly
                    adopted steam traction. But the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway, opened
                    in 1830, first impressed the national mind with the fact that a revolution in
                    the methods of travelling had really taken place; and further, it was for it
                    that the first high-speed locomotive of the modern type was invented and
                    constructed. The directors having offered a prize of £500 for the best engine,
                    trials were held on a finished portion of the line at Rainhill in October 1829,
                    and three engines took part—the Rocket of George and Robert Stephenson, the
                    Novelty of John Braithwaite and John Ericsson, and the Sanspareil of Timothy
                    Hackworth. The last two of these engines broke down under trial, but the Rocket
                    fulfilled the conditions and won the prize. Its two steam cylinders were 8 in.
                    in diameter, with a stroke of 16½ in., and the driving wheels, which were placed
                    in front under the funnel, were 4 ft. 8½ in. in diameter. The engine weighed 4¼
                    tons; the tender following it, 3 tons 4cwt.; and the two loaded carriages drawn
                    by it on the trial, 9 tons 11 cwt.: thus the weight drawn was 12¾ tons, and the
                    gross total of the train 17 tons. The boiler evaporated 18¼ cub. ft., or 114
                    gals., of water an hour, and the steam pressure was 50 lb per square inch. The
                    engine drew a train weighing 13 tons 35 m. in 48 minutes, the rate being thus
                    nearly 44 m. an hour; subsequently it drew an average gross load of 40 tons
                    behind the tender at 13·3 m. an hour. The Rocket possessed the three elements of
                    efficiency of the modern locomotive—the internal water-surrounded fire-box and
                    the multitubular flue in the boiler; the blast-pipe, by which the steam after
                    doing its work in the cylinders was exhausted up the chimney, and thus served to
                    increase the draught and promote the rapid combustion of the fuel; and the
                    direct connexion of the steam cylinders, one on each side of the engine, with
                    the two driving wheels mounted on one axle. Of these features, the blast-pipe
                    had been employed by Trevithick on his engine of 1804, and direct driving,
                    without intermediate gearing, had been adopted in several previous engines; but
                    the use of a number (25) of small tubes in place of one or two large flues was
                    an innovation which in conjunction with the blast-pipe contributed greatly to
                    the efficiency of the engine. After the success of the Rocket, the Stephensons
                    received orders to build seven more engines, which were of very similar design,
                    though rather larger, being four-wheeled engines, with the two driving wheels in
                    front and the cylinders behind; and in October 1830 they constructed a ninth
                    engine, the Planet, also for the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway, which
                    still more closely resembled the modern type, since the driving wheels were
                    placed at the fire-box end, while the two cylinders were arranged under the
                    smoke-box, inside the frames. The main features of the steam locomotive were
                    thus established, and its subsequent development is chiefly a history of gradual
                    increase in size and power, and of improvements in design, in material and in
                    mechanical construction, tending to increased efficiency and economy of
                    operation.</p>
               <p>In America the development of the locomotive dates from almost the same time as
                    in England. The earliest examples used in that country, apart from a small
                    experimental model constructed by Peter Cooper, came from England. In 1828, on
                    behalf of the Delaware &amp; Hudson Canal Company, which had determined to
                    build a line, 16 m. long, from Carbondale to Honesdale, Pennsylvania, Horatio
                    Allen ordered three locomotives from Messrs Foster &amp; Rastrick, of
                    Stourbridge, and one from George Stephenson. The latter, named the America, was
                    the first to be delivered, reaching New York in January 1829, but one of the
                    others, the Stourbridge Lion, was actually the first practical steam locomotive
                    to run in America, which it did on the 9th of August 1829. The first
                    American-built locomotive, the Best Friend, of Charleston, was made at the West
                    Point Foundry, New York, in 1830, and was put to work on the South Carolina
                    railroad in that year. It had a vertical boiler, and was carried on four wheels
                    all coupled, the two cylinders being placed in an inclined position and having a
                    bore of about 6 in. with a stroke of 16 in. It is reported to have hauled 40 or
                    50 passengers in 4 or 5 cars at a speed of 16-21 m. an hour. After a few months
                    of life it was blown up, its attendant, annoyed by the sound of the escaping
                    steam, having fastened down the safety-valve. A second engine, the West Point,
                    also built at West Point Foundry for the South Carolina railroad, differed from
                    the Best Friend in having a horizontal boiler with 6 or 8 tubes, though in other
                    respects it was similar. In 1831 the Baltimore &amp; Ohio Company offered a
                    prize of $4000 for an American engine weighing 3½ tons, able to draw 15 tons at
                    15 m. an hour on the level: it was won by the York of Messrs Davis &amp;
                    Gartner in the following year. Matthias W. Baldwin, the founder of the famous
                    Baldwin Locomotive Works in Philadelphia, built his first engine, Old Ironsides,
                    for the Philadelphia, Germantown &amp; Morristowíi railroad; first tried in
                    November 1832, it was modelled on Stephenson’s Planet, and had a single pair of
                    driving wheels at the firebox end and a pair of carrying wheels under the
                    smoke-box. His second engine, the E. L. Miller, delivered to the South Carolina
                    railroad in 1834, presented a feature which has remained characteristic of
                    American locomotives—the front part was supported on a four-wheeled swivelling
                    bogie-truck, a device, however, which had been applied to Puffing Billy in
                    England when it was rebuilt in 1815.</p>
               <p>The Liverpool &amp; Manchester line achieved a success which surpassed the
                    anticipations even of its promoters, and in con-sequence numerous projects were
                    started for the construction of railways in various parts of Great Britain. In
                    the decade following its opening nearly 2000 m. of railway were sanctioned by
                    parliament, including the beginnings of most of the existing trunk-lines, and in
                    1840 the actual mileage reached 1331 m. The next decade saw the “ railway mania.
                    ” The amount of capital which parliament authorized railway companies to raise
                    was about 4½ millions on the average of the two years 1842-1843, 17¾ millions in
                    1844, 60 millions in 1845, and 132 millions in 1846, though this last sum was
                    less than a quarter of the capital proposed in the schemes submitted to the
                    Board of Trade; and the wild speculation which occurred in railway shares in
                    1845 contributed largely to the financial crisis of 1847. In 1850 the mileage
                    was 6635, in i860 it was 10,410, and in 1870 it was 15,310. The increase in the
                    decade 1860-1870 was thus nearly 50%, but subsequently the rate of increase
                    slackened, and the mileages in 1880, 1890 and 1900 were 17,935, 20,073 and 21,
                    855. In the United States progress was more rapid, for, beginning at 2816 in
                    1840, the mileage reached 9015 in 1850, 30,600 in 1860, 87,801 in 1880, and
                    198,964 in 1900. Canada had no railway till 1853, and in South America
                    construction did not begin till about the same time. France and Austria opened
                    their first lines in 1828; Belgium, Germany, Russia, Italy and Holland in the
                    succeeding decade; Switzerland and Denmark in 1844, Spain in 1848, Sweden in
                    1851, Norway in 1853, and Portugal in 1854; while Turkey and Greece delayed till
                    1860 and 1869. In Africa Egypt opened her first line (between Alexandria and
                    Cairo) in 1856, and Cape Colony followed in i860. In Asia the first line was
                    that between Bombay and Tannah, opened in 1853, and in Australia Victoria began
                    her railway system in 1854 (see also the articles on the various countries for
                    further details about their railways).</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Transcontinental Railways. —</hi> A railway line across
                    North America was first completed in 1869, when the Union Pacific, building from
                    the Missouri river at Omaha (1400 m. west of New York), met the Central Pacific,
                    which built from San Francisco eastwards, making a line 1848 m. long through a
                    country then for the most part uninhabited. This was followed by the Southern
                    Pacific in 1881, from San Francisco to New Orleans, 2489 miles; the Northern
                    Pacific, from St Paul to Portland, Ore., in 1883; the Atchison, Topeka &amp;
                    Santa Fé, from Kansas City to San Diego; and the Great Northern from St. Paul to
                    Seattle and New Westminster in 1893. Meanwhile the Canadian Pacific, a true
                    transcontinental line, was built from Montreal, on Atlantic tide-water, to the
                    Pacific at Vancouver, 2906 m. But these lines have been</p>

               <p>dwarfed since 1891 by the Siberian railway, built by the Russian government
                    ëntirely across the continent of Asia from Cheliabinsk (1769 m. by rail east of
                    St Petersburg) to Vladi-vostok, a distance of 4073 m., with a branch from
                    Kharbin about 500 m. long to Dalny and Port Arthur. The main line was finished
                    in 1902, except for a length of about 170 m. in very difficult country around
                    the south end of Lake Baikal; this was constructed in 1904, communication being
                    maintained in the interval by ferry-boats, which conveyed all the carriages of a
                    train across the lake, more than 40 m., when the ice permitted. A
                    transcontinental line was long ago undertaken across South America from Buenos
                    Aires to Valparaiso, where the continent is only about 900 m. wide. The last
                    section through the Andes was finished in 1910. (H. M. R. )</p>

               <p>In the United States railway mileage now tends to increase at the rate of
                    slightly over 5000 miles a year, which is about 2⅕% on the present main line
                    mileage. In the ’eighties, the country passed through a period of competitive
                    building, which was productive of much financial disaster. Thus, in 1882, 11,
                    569 m. were built—an addition equivalent to more than 11 % of mileage then
                    existing—and in 1887, 12, 876 m. were built. Unjustifiable railway expansion had
                    much to do with the American commercial panics of 1884 and 1893. After the
                    reconstruction period of the 1893 panic, however, the tendency for a number of
                    years was to spend larger sums in bettering existing railways rather than in new
                    exten-sions. The decade from 1896 until 1905, inclusive, saw huge sums spent on
                    yards, passing tracks, grade reduction, elimination of curves, substitution of
                    large locomotives and cars for small ones, &amp;c. During those ten years,
                    the route mileage increased 34, 991 m., or 17%, while the mileage of second,
                    third, fourth and yard tracks and sidings increased 32, 666 m., or nearly 57 %.
                    The number of locomotives increased 12, 407, or 35%, and the number of freight
                    cars, 545, 222, or 42%. Moreover, the average tractive power per locomotive and
                    the average capacity per freight car advanced greatly in this period, although
                    specific figures cannot be given.</p>
               <p>Thus it may fairly be said that the railway system of the United States was
                    reconstructed between 1896 and 1905, so far as concerns rails, sleepers, ballast
                    and the general capacity of a given group of lines to perform work. About 1905,
                    however, a new tendency became apparent. At that time the so-called
                    transcontinental</p>
               <p>railways, connecting the Pacific coast of the United States with the central
                    portions of the country, and thus with the group of railways reaching the
                    Atlantic seaboard, consisted of five railways within the borders of the United
                    States, and one in Canada, In Canada the Canadian Pacific was the only
                    transcontinental line, extending from St John, on the bay of Fundy, and from
                    Quebec, on the river St Lawrence, to Vancouver, on the strait of Georgia, the
                    distance from St John to Vancouver being approximately 3379 m. Within the
                    boundaries of the United States the northernmost of the trans-continental lines
                    was the Great Northern railway, extending from a point opposite Vancouver, B.
                    C., and from Seattle, Wash., to Duluth, on Lake Superior, and to St Paul and
                    Minneapolis, Minn., where connexion through to Chicago was made over an allied
                    line, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy, owned jointly by the Great
                    Northern and the Northern Pacific.</p>
               <p>Next, south of the Great Northern, lay the Northern Pacific railway, starting on
                    the west from Portland, Ore., and from Seattle and Tacoma, Wash., and extending
                    east to Duluth, St Paul and Minneapolis by way of Helena, Mont. The Central
                    Pacific-Union Pacific route to the coast, with its important affiliated
                    companies, the Oregon Short Line and the Oregon Railroad &amp; Navigation
                    Company, extended from San Francisco, Cal., and Portland, Ore., to Omaha, Neb.,
                    by way of Salt Lake City; the Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fé extended from
                    San Francisco and Los Angeles, Cal., to Chicago and to Galveston, Tex.; while
                    the Southern Pacific had its line from San Francisco and Los Angeles to
                    Galveston and New Orleans, running for the greater part of the distance just
                    north of the Mexican border.</p>
               <p>Thus it will be observed that the five great cities of the Pacific coast—Seattle
                    and Tacoma, Wash., Portland, Ore., and San Francisco and Los Angeles, Cal. —were
                    already well supplied with railways; but the growth of the fertile region lying
                    west of the transcontinental divide was most attractive to American railway
                    builders; and railways serving this district, almost all of them in trouble ten
                    years before, were showing great increases in earnings. In 1903 the Gould lines
                    determined to enter this Pacific territory. Hitherto the western terminus of
                    this group of lines had been Salt Lake City, Utah; by the exceedingly bold
                    construction of the Western Pacific from Salt Lake City to Oakland, Cal.,
                    opposite San Francisco, an additional line to the Pacific coast was provided,
                    having low grades and being in all respects well adapted for cheap operation.</p>
               <p>Shortly after the plans were announced for building the Western Pacific, the
                    Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St Paul also decided to extend west. Before that
                    time the St Paul had been a great local railway, operating primarily in the
                    Dakotas, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and Illinois; but by the construction of a
                    long arm from the Missouri river to Spokane, Seattle and Tacoma, it became a
                    transcontinental line of the first importance, avoiding the mistakes of earlier
                    railway builders by securing a line with easy gradients through the most
                    favourable regions.</p>
               <p>At the same time that these two extensions were being undertaken by old and
                    well-established railways, a new company—the Kansas City, Mexico &amp;
                    Orient—was engaged in constructing a line almost due south-west from Kansas
                    City, Mo., to the lower part of the gulf of California in Mexico; while an
                    additional independent line was under construction from Denver in a
                    north-westerly direction towards the Pacific coast. The guarantee for this
                    activity may be illustrated by a single fact: the combined building operations,
                    in 1908, of San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles, Spokane and Salt Lake
                    City exceeded thç combined building opera-tions of Philadelphia, Pittsburg,
                    Kansas City, Boston, Baltimore and Cincinnati during the same year. San
                    Francisco spent more in new permanent structures than Philadelphia, and Seattle
                    spent more than Pittsburg.</p>
               <p>Recent American railway development, viewed in its larger aspects, has thus been
                    characterized by what may be described as the rediscovery of the Pacific coast.
                    How far this movement will extend it is impossible to say; it is certain,
                    however, that it will be enormously important in re-aligning trade conditions in
                    the United States, Canada and Mexico.</p>

               <p>having nearly the same amount of railway mileage. In Mexico the national
                    government is carrying out a consistent policy of developing its railway lines.
                    It has succeeded in restoring the credit of these enterprises, and is proceeding
                    with care and skill to form the lines into an efficient transportation system.
                    In Argentina about 15% of the railways are owned and operated by the government,
                    the balance being in the hands of private companies, largely controlled in
                    England. Development of these lines has been primarily an extension from the
                    large cities in the East to the agricultural districts in the West, but a change
                    of great importance was brought about in 1910 by the completion of the last
                    tunnel on the Argentine Transandine Railway, which serves to connect Santiago,
                    Valparaiso and the other great cities of the west coast with Buenos Aires,
                    Montevideo, Bahia, Rio de Janeiro and the other great cities of the cast coast.
                    Naturally the company named docs not reach all of these points, but its line
                    across the Andes supplies the indispensable link of communication, in the
                    absence of which the east coast towns and the west coast towns have hitherto
                    been as widely separated as if they had been located on different
                    continents—indeed, far more widely separated in point of time and of freight
                    charges than Great Britain and the United States.</p>

               <p>Although more than half of the total mileage of Asia is in British India, it is
                    probable that the greatest proportionate gains in the near future will be in
                    Chlna, Siberia and Manchuria, and Central Russia in Asia. In proportion to its
                    population China has the least railway development of any of the great countries
                    of the world; the probability that its present commercial awakening will extend
                    seems large, and in that case it will need a vast increase in its interior
                    communications.</p>
               <p>In Africa, it will be seen by Table V. that the railway mileage in the British
                    possessions amounts to almost five-sixths of the total.</p>

               <p>The so-called Cape-to-Cairo route shows occasional extensions, particularly in
                    the opening up of new country in Central Africa by the Rhodesian railway system.
                    The Rhodesian railway system in 1910 had penetrated north of Broken Hill, which
                    is just above the fifteenth parallel of south latitude, while the Egyptian
                    railway system had reached Gondokoro, located close to the fifth parallel of
                    north latitude. The intervening distance, through country exceedingly unhealthy
                    for white men, and therefore promising no traffic except raw materials, does not
                    seem a likely field for rapid railway extension.</p>
               <p>ln Australia the increase in railway mileage in the five years ending December
                    31st, 1907 was about 7%—a small proportion as compared with America, Asia or
                    Africa. The greatest increase, both relative and absolute, was in Queensland;
                    the smallest in South Australia, which added only 24 m. during the five years.
                    Yet the mileage open per 10, 000 inhabitants in Australia, as a whole, far
                    surpasses that in any other of the broad geographical divisions.</p>

               <p><hi rend="italic">Capital. —</hi> The total construction capital invested in
                    the railways of the world in 1907 was estimated by the <hi rend="italic">Archiv
                        für Eisenbahnwesen</hi> at £8,986,150,000; the figure is necessarily
                    incomplete, though it serves as a rough approximation. This total was divided
                    nearly evenly between the countries of Europe and the rest of the world. The
                    United States of America, with a capital of £3, 059, 800, 000 invested in its
                    railways on the 3oth of June 1906, was easily ahead of every other country, and
                    in 1908 the figure was increased to £3,443,027,685, of which £2,636,569,089 was
                    in the hands of the public. On a route-mileage basis, however, the capital cost
                    of the British railway system is far greater than that of any other country in
                    the world, partly because a vast proportion of the lines are double, treble or
                    even quadruple, partly because the safety requirements of the Board of Trade and
                    the high standards of the original builders made actual construction very
                    costly.</p>
               <p>The total paid-up railway capital of the United Kingdom amounted, in 1908, to
                    £1,310,533,212, or an average capitalization of £56,476 per route mile, though
                    it should be noted that this total included £196,364,618 of nominal additions
                    through “ stock splitting, ” &amp;c. Per mile of single track, the
                    capitalization in England and Wales, Scotland, Ireland and the United Kingdom,

                    to 14, 353 in 1908, and the cost of constructing them was probably not far from

               <p>The figures for the United States are from the report of the Inter-state
                    Commerce Commission for the year ended 3oth of June 1908, and comprise mileage
                    of first, second, third and fourth tracks, and paid-up capital in the hands of
                    the public only. The British figures are from the Board of Trade returns for the
                    calendar year 1908. In comparing the figures, it should be noted that main line
                    mileage in the Eastern states, as for example that of the Pennsylvania railroad
                    and the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford, does not differ greatly in
                    standards of safety or in unit cost from the best British construction, although
                    improvement work in America is charged to income far more liberally than it has
                    been in England. But there are long stretches of pine loam in the South where
                    branch lines can be, and are, built and equipped for £2400 or less per mile,
                    while the construction of new main line in the prairie region of the West ought
                    not to cost more than £4000 per single-track-mile, under present conditions.</p>
               <p>The problem of the early railway builders in the United States was to conquer
                    the wilderness, to build an empire, and at the same time to bind the East to the
                    West and the North to the South. There can be little doubt but that the United
                    States would long ago have disintegrated into separate, warring republics, had
                    they not been bound together by railways, and standards of safety were</p>
               <p>rightly subordinated to the main task to be accomplished. Conquest is not
                    usually bloodless, whether achieved at the van of a marching column or at the
                    head of a hastily-built railway, and the process under which the American
                    railway system took form left the way open for a distressing record of accidents
                    to the traveller and the railway servant. But as traffic becomes more dense,
                    year by year, the rebuilding process is constant, and American railway lines are
                    gradually becoming safer</p>
               <p>In Europe the average route-mile capital is £27, 036, and Table IX. shows the
                    differences between various countries.</p>

               <p><hi rend="italic">Statistical Study of Railway Operation. —</hi> The study of
                    railway operation through statistics has two distinct aspects. It has been well
                    said that statistics furnish the means by which the railway manager disciplines
                    his property; this is the aspect of control. On the other hand, the banker, the
                    government official and the economist use railway statistics to obtain
                    information which may be characterized as static rather than dynamic. Both uses
                    ultimately rest upon comparison of the observed data from a certain property
                    with the observed data from other properties, or with predetermined standards of
                    performance.</p>
               <p>In general, the British working unit supplied as public infor-mation has always
                    been the goods-train-mile and the passenger-train-mile, these figures being the
                    products of the number of trains into the number of miles they have travelled.
                    In America, the basic units have been the ton-mile and the passenger-mile, and
                    these figures are now required to be furnished to the Interstate Commerce
                    Commission and to most of the state commissions as well. Both the British
                    manager and the American manager, however, are supplied with a considerable
                    number of daily, weekly and monthly reports, varying on different railways,
                    which are not made public. The daily sheets usually include a summarized
                    statement of the per-formance of every train on the line, covering the amount of
                    business done, the destination of the loads, &amp;c. For a number of years
                    there has been a movement in Great Britain to require the inclusion of ton-mile
                    statistics in the stated returns to the Board of Trade, but most railway
                    managers have objected to the change on the ground that their own confidential
                    information was already adequate for purposes of control, and that ton-mile
                    statistics would require additional clerical force to a costly extent. The
                    Departmental Committee of the Board of Trade, sitting in 1909 to consider
                    railway accounting forms, while recommending ton-miles to the careful
                    consideration of those responsible for railway working in Great Britain,
                    considered the question of their necessity in British practice to be still open,
                    and held that, at all events, they should not be introduced under compulsion.</p>

               <p>It was at one time an axiom of law and of political economy that prices should
                    be determined by free competition. But in the development of the railway
                    business it soon became evident</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0825" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0850.jp2"/>
               <p>that no such dependence on free competition was possible, either in practice or
                    in theory. This difficulty is not peculiar to railways; but it was in the
                    history of railway economy and railway control that certain characteristics
                    which are now manifesting themselves in all directions where large investments
                    of fixed capital are involved were first brought prominently to public notice.</p>
               <p>For a large number of those who use a railway, competition in its more obvious
                    forms does not and cannot exist. Independent carriers cannot run trains over the
                    same line and underbid one another in offering transportation services. It would
                    be practically impossible for a line thus used by different carriers to be
                    operated either with safety, or with economy, or with the advantage to the
                    public which a centralized management affords. It is equally impossible for the
                    majority of shippers to enjoy the competition of parallel lines. Such
                    duplication of railways involves a waste of capital. If parallel lines compete
                    at all points, they cause ruin to the investors. If they compete at some points
                    and not at others, they produce a discrimination or preference with regard to
                    rates and facilities, which builds up the competitive points at the expense of
                    the non-competitive ones. Such partial competition, with the discrimination it
                    involves, is liable to be worse for the public than no competition at all. It
                    increases the tendency, already too strong, towards concentration of industrial
                    life in large towns. It produces an uncertainty with regard to rates which
                    prevents stability of prices, and is apt to promote the interests of the
                    unscrupulous speculator at the expense of those whose business methods are more
                    conservative. So marked are these evils that such partial competition is avoided
                    by agreements between the competing lines with regard to rates, and by divisions
                    of traffic, or pools, which shall take away the temptation to violate such rate
                    agreements. The common law has been somewhat unfavourable to the enforcement of
                    such agreements, and statutes in the United States, both local and national,
                    have attempted to prohibit them; but the public advantage from their existence
                    has been so great as to render their legal disabilities inoperative. In those
                    parts of the continent of Europe where railways are owned and administered by
                    state authority, the necessity for such agreements is frankly admitted.</p>
               <p>But if rates are to be fixed by agreement, and not by competition, what
                    principle can be recognized as a legitimate basis of railway rate-making? The
                    first efforts at railway legislation were governed by the equal mileage
                    principle; that is, the attempt was made to make rates proportionate to the
                    distance. It was, however, soon seen that this was inadmissible. So much of the
                    expense of the handling, both of freight and of passengers, was independent of
                    the length of the journey that a mileage rate sufficiently large for short
                    distances was unnecessarily burdensome for long ones, and was bound to destroy
                    long-distance traffic, if the theory were consistently applied. The system has
                    been retained in large measure in passenger business, but only because of the
                    conflict which inevitably occurs between the authorities and the passengers with
                    regard to the privilege of breaking and resuming a journey when passenger rates
                    are arranged on any other plan. In freight schedules it has been completely
                    abandoned.</p>
               <p>A somewhat better theory of rate regulation was then framed, which divided
                    railway expenditures into movement expense, connected with the line in general,
                    and terminal expense, which connected itself with the stations and station
                    service. Under this system each consignment of freight is compelled to pay its
                    share of the terminal expense, independently of distance, <hi rend="italic">plus</hi> a mileage charge proportionate to the length of the journey or
                    haul. There has been also a further attempt in England to divide terminal
                    charges into station and service terminals, according to the nature of the work
                    for which compensation is sought. But none of these classifications of expense
                    reaches the root of the matter. A system of charges which compels each piece of
                    traffic to pay its share of the charges for track and for stations overlooks the
                    fundamental fact that a very large part of the expenses of a railway—more than
                    half—is not connected either with the cost of moving traffic or of handling
                    traffic at stations, but with the cost of maintaining the property as a whole.
                    Of this character are the expenditures necessary for maintenance of way, for
                    general administration and for interest on capital borrowed, which are almost
                    independent of the total amount of business done, and quite independent of any
                    individual piece of business. To say that all traffic must bear its share of
                    these interest and maintenance charges is to impose upon the railways a rate
                    which would cut off much of the long-distance traffic, and much of the traffic
                    in cheap articles, which is of great value to the public, and which, from its
                    very magni-tude, is a thing that railways could not afford to lose. It is also a
                    fact that with each recurring decade these general expenses (also called
                    indirect, undistributed or fixed charges) have an increased importance as
                    compared with the particular (direct, distributed or operating) expense
                    attaching naturally to the particular portions of the traffic. For with
                    increased density of population it becomes profitable to make improvements on
                    the original location, even though this may involve increased charges for
                    interest and for some parts of its maintenance, for the sake of securing that
                    economy of operation, through larger train-loads, which such an improved
                    location makes possible.</p>
               <p>Whatever the ostensible form of a railway tariff, the contribution of the
                    different shipments of freight to these general expenses is determined on the
                    principle of charging what the traffic will bear. Under this principle, rates
                    are reduced where the increase of business which follows such reduction makes
                    the change a profitable one. They are kept relatively high in those cases where
                    the expansion of business which follows a reduction is small, and where such a
                    change is therefore unprofitable. This theory of charging what the traffic will
                    bear is an unpopular one, because it has been misapplied by railway managers and
                    made an excuse for charging what the traffic will not bear. Rightly applied,
                    however, it is the only sound economic principle. It means taxation according to
                    ability—that ability being determined by actual experiment.</p>
               <p>In the practical carrying out of this principle, railways divide all articles of
                    freight into classes, the highest of which are charged two or three, or even
                    four times the rates of the lowest. This classification is based partly upon
                    special conditions of service, which make some articles more economical to carry
                    than others (with particular reference to the question whether the goods are
                    offered to the companies in car-loads or in smàll parcels), but chiefly with
                    regard to the commercial value of the article, and its consequent ability to
                    bear a high charge or a low one. For each of these classes a rate-sheet gives
                    the actual rate-charge per unit of weight between the various stations covered
                    by the tariff. This rate increases as the distance increases, but not in equal
                    proportion; while the rates from large trade centres to other trade centres at a
                    great distance are not higher than those to intermediate points somewhat less
                    remote; if the law permits, there is a tendency to make them actually a little
                    lower. Besides the system of charges thus prescribed in the classification and
                    rate-sheet, each tariff provides for a certain number of special rates or
                    charges made for particular lines of trade in certain localities, independently
                    of their relation to the general system. If these special rates are published in
                    the tariff, and are offered to all persons alike, provided they can fulfil the
                    conditions imposed by the company, they are known as commodity rates, and arc
                    apparently a necessity in any scheme of railway charges. If, however, they are
                    not published, and are given to certain persons as individual favours, they
                    become a prolific source of abuse, and are quite indefensible from the
                    standpoint of political economy.</p>
               <p>While the superficial appearance of the railway tariff is different for
                    different countries, and sometimes for different parts of the same country, the
                    general principles laid down are followed in rate-making by all well-managed
                    lines, whether state or private. It is a mistake to suppose that the question of
                    public or private ownership will make any considerable difference in the system
                    of rate-making adopted by a good railway. A state system will be compelled, by
                    the exigencies</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0826" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0851.jp2"/>
               <p>of the public treasury, to arrange its rates to pay interest on its securities;
                    a private company will generally be prevented, by the indirect competition of
                    railways in other parts of the country which it serves, from doing very much
                    more than this. The relative merit of the two systems depends upon the question
                    how we can secure the best efficiency and equity in the application of the
                    principles thus far laid down. There are three different systems of control: —</p>
               <p>1. <hi rend="italic">Private operation, subject only to judicial regulation,</hi> was exemplified most fully in the early railway history of the United
                    States. Until 1870 railway companies were almost free from special acts of
                    control; and, in general, any company that could raise or borrow the capital was
                    allowed to build a railway wherever it saw fit. In the United Kingdom there was
                    almost as much immunity from legislative interference with charges, but the
                    companies were compelled to secure special charters, and to conform to
                    regulations made by the Board of Trade in the interests of public safety. The
                    advantage of this relatively free system of railway building and management is
                    that it secures efficient and progressive methods. Most of the im-provements in
                    operation and in traffic management have had their origin in one of these two
                    countries. The disadvantage attendant upon this system is that the courts are
                    reluctant to exercise the right of regulation, except on old and traditional
                    lines, and that in the face of new business methods the public may be
                    inadequately protected. There is also this further disadvantage, that in the
                    gradual progress of consolidation railway companies take upon themselves the
                    aspect of large monopolies, of whose apparently unrestricted power the public is
                    jealous. As a result of these difficulties there has been, both in the United
                    Kingdom and in the United States, a progressive increase of legislative
                    interference with railways. In the former the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of
                    1854 specially prohibited preferences, either in facilities or in rates. The
                    Regulation of Railways Act of 1873 provided for a Railway Commission, which
                    should be so constituted as to take cognizance of cases on the investigation of
                    which the courts were reluctant to enter. Finally, the legislation of 1888 put
                    into the hands of a reorganized Railway Commission and of the Board of Trade
                    powers none the less important in principle because their action has been less
                    in its practical effect than the advocates of active control demanded. In the
                    United States the years from 1870 to 1875 witnessed sweeping and generally
                    ill-considered legislation (“ Granger ” Acts) concerning railway charges
                    throughout the Mississippi valley; while the years from 1884 to 1887 were marked
                    by more conservative, and for that reason more en-forceable, acts, which
                    culminated in the Interstate Commerce Act, prohibiting personal discrimination
                    and gradually restricting discrimination between places, and providing for a
                    National Commission of very considerable power—not to speak of the pooling
                    clause, which was extraneous to the general purpose of the act, and has tended
                    to defeat rather than strengthen its operation.</p>
               <p>2. <hi rend="italic">Operation by private companies, under specific provisions
                        of the government authorities with regard to the method of its exercise,</hi> has been the policy consistently carried out in France, and less
                    systematically and consistently in other countries under the domination of the
                    Latin race. It was believed by its advocates that this system of prescribing the
                    conditions of construction and operation of lines could promote public safety,
                    prevent waste of capital and secure passengers and shippers against extortionate
                    rates. These expectations have been only partially fulfilled. Well trained as
                    was the civil service of France, the effect of this supervision in deadening
                    activity was sometimes more marked than in its effect in preventing abuse.
                    Moreover, such a system of regulation almost necessarily carries with it a
                    guarantee of monopoly to the various companies concerned, and not infrequently
                    large gifts in the form of subsidies, for without such aid private capital will
                    not submit to the special burdens involved. These rights, whether of monopoly or
                    of subsidy, form a means of abuse in many direc-tions. Where the government is
                    bad, they are a fruitful source of corruption; even where it is good, they
                    enable the companies to drive hard bargains with the public, and prevent the
                    expected benefits of official control from being realized.</p>
               <p>3. <hi rend="italic">State operation and ownership</hi> is a system which
                    originated in Belgium at the beginning of railway enterprise, and has been
                    consistently carried out by the Scandinavian countries and by Hungary. Since
                    i860 it has been the policy of Australia. It has generally come to be that of
                    Germany and, so far as the finances of the countries allow, of Austria and
                    Russia; British India also affords not a few examples of the same method. The
                    theory of state ownership is excellent. So large a part of the railway charge is
                    of the nature of a tax, that there seem to be a priori reasons for leaving the
                    taxing powers in the hands of the agents of the government. In practice its
                    operation is far more uncertain. Whether the intelligence and efficiency of the
                    officials charged by the state with the handling of its railway system will be
                    sufficient to make them act in the interest of the public as fully as do the
                    managers of private corporations, is a question whose answer can only be
                    determined by actual experience in each case. If they fail to have these
                    qualities, the complete monopoly which a government enjoys, and the powers of
                    borrowing which are furnished by the use of the public credit, increase instead
                    of diminishing the danger of arbitrary action, unprogressiveness and waste of
                    capital. Even in matters like public safety it is by no means certain that
                    government authorities will do so well as private ones. The question is one
                    which practical railway men have long since ceased to argue on general
                    principles; they recognize that the answer depends upon the respective degree of
                    talent and integrity which characterize the business community on the one hand
                    and the government officials on the other.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcaps">British Railway Legislation</hi></p>
               <p>The first thing a railway company in Great Britain has to do is to obtain a
                    special or private act of parliament authorizing the construction of the line.
                    Not that the mere laying or working of a railway requires parliamentary
                    sanction, so long as the work does not interfere with other people’s rights and
                    interests. An example of a railway built without any legislative authority is
                    the little mountain railway from Llanberis to the summit of Snowdon, which was
                    made by the owner of the land through which it passes. Such a railway has no
                    statutory rights and no special obligations, and the owner of it is liable to be
                    sued for creating a nuisance if the work-ing of the line interferes with the
                    comfort of those residing in the neighbourhood. When, however, a company desires
                    to construct a line on a commercial scale, to acquire land compulsorily, to
                    divert rivers and streams, to cross roads either on the level or by means of
                    bridges, to pass near houses, to build tunnels or viaducts, and to execute all
                    the other works incidental to a railway, and to work the line when completed
                    without interference, it is essential that the authority of parliament should be
                    obtained. The company therefore promotes a bill, which is considered first by
                    select committees of the two houses of parliament, and afterwards by the two
                    houses themselves, during which period it faces the opposition, if any, of rival
                    concerns, of local authorities and of hostile landowners. If this is
                    successfully overcome, and the proposals meet with the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0827" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0852.jp2"/>
               <p>approval of parliament, the bill is passed and, after securing the Royal Assent,
                    becomes an act of parliament. The company is then free to proceed with the work
                    of construction, and at once becomes subject to various general acts, such as
                    the Companies Clauses Act, which affects all joint-stock companies incorporated
                    by any special act; the Land Clauses Act, which has reference to all companies
                    having powers to acquire land compulsorily; the Railway Clauses Act, which
                    imposes certain conditions on all railways alike (except light railways); the
                    various Regulation of Railways Acts; the Carriers Protection Act; acts for the
                    conveyance of mails, parcels, troops; acts relating to telegraphs, to the
                    conveyance of workmen and to the housing of the labouring classes; and several
                    others which it is unnecessary to specify. From the early days of railways
                    parliament has also been careful to provide for the safety of the public by
                    inserting in the general or special acts definite con-ditions, and by laying
                    upon the Board of Trade the duty of protecting the public using a railway.</p>
               <p>The first act which has reference to the safety of passengers is the Regulation
                    of Railways Act of 1842, which obliges every railway company to give notice to
                    the Board of Trade of its intention to open the railway for passenger traffic,
                    and places upon that public department the duty of inspecting the line before
                    the opening of it takes place. If the officer appointed by the Board of Trade
                    should, after inspection of the railway, report to the department that in his
                    opinion “the opening of the same would be attended with danger to the public
                    using the same, by reason of the incompleteness of the works or permanent way,
                    or the insufficiency of the establishment for working such railway, ” it is
                    lawful for the department to direct the company to postpone the opening of the
                    line for any period not exceeding one month at a time, the process being
                    repeated from month to month as often as may be necessary. The company is liable
                    to a fine of twenty pounds a day if it should open the line in contravention of
                    such order or direction. The inspections made by the officers of the Board of
                    Trade under this act are very complete: the permanent way, bridges, viaducts,
                    tunnels and other works are carefully examined; all iron or steel girders are
                    tested; stations, including platforms, stairways, waiting-rooms, &amp;c.,
                    are inspected; and the signalling and “ interlocking ” are thoroughly
                    overhauled. A code of requirements in regard to the opening of new railways has
                    been drawn up by the department for the guidance of railway companies, and as
                    the special circumstances of each line are considered on their merits, it rarely
                    happens that the department finds it necessary to prohibit the opening of a new
                    railway. The Regulation of Railways Act of 1871 extends the provisions of the
                    above act to the opening of “ any additional line of railway, deviation line,
                    station, junction or crossing on the level ’’ which forms a portion of or is
                    connected with a passenger railway, and which has been constructed subsequently
                    to the inspection of it. This act further defines the duties and powers of the
                    inspectors of the Board of Trade, and also authorizes the Board to dispense with
                    the notice which the previous act</p>
               <p>requires to be given prior to the opening of a railway.</p>
               <p>It may be remarked that neither of these acts confers on the Board of Trade any
                    power to inspect a railway after it has once been opened, unless and until some
                    addition or alteration, such as is defined in the last-named act, has been made.
                    When a line has once been inspected and passed, it lies with the company to
                    maintain it in accordance with the standard of efficiency it originally
                    possessed, but no express statutory obligation to do so is imposed upon the
                    company, and whether it does so or not, the Board of Trade cannot interfere.</p>
               <p>The act of 1871 further renders it obligatory upon every railway company to send
                    notice to the Board of Trade in the case of (1) any accident attended with loss
                    of life or personal injury to any person whatsoever; (2) any collision where one
                    of the trains is a passenger train;</p>
               <p>(3) any passenger train or part of such train leaving the rails;</p>
               <p>(4) any other accident likely to have caused loss of life or personal injury,
                    and specified on that ground by any order made from time to time by the Board of
                    Trade. The department is authorized, on receipt of such report, to direct an
                    inquiry to be made into the cause of any accident so reported, and the inspector
                    appointed to make the inquiry is given power to enter any railway premises for
                    the purposes of his inquiry, and to summon any person engaged upon the railway
                    to attend the inquiry as a witness, and to require the production of all books,
                    papers and documents which he considers important for the purpose. The
                    inspector, after making his investigation, is re-quirçd to make a report to the
                    Board of Trade as to the causes of the accident and the circumstances attending
                    the same, with any observations on the subject which he deems right, and the
                    Board “ shall cause every such report to be made public in such manner as they
                    think expedient. ” The usual mode of publishing such reports is to forward them
                    to railway companies con-cerned, as well as to the press, and on application to
                    any one else who is interested. The reports are subsequently included in a
                    Blue-book and presented to parliament. It should be noted that although the
                    inspecting officer may in his report make any recommendations that he may think
                    fit with a view to guarding against any similar accident occurring in the
                    future, no power is given to the Board of Trade, or to any other authority, to
                    compel any railway company to adopt such recommendations. This omission is
                    sometimes held to be an error, but as a fact it is an advantage. The moral
                    effect of the report, with the criticisms of the company’s methods and
                    recommendations appended thereto, is great, and it rarely happens that a company
                    refuses to adopt, or at any rate to test, the recommendations so made. If, on
                    the other hand, the company is of opinion that the suggestions of the inspecting
                    officer are not likely to prove beneficial, or are for any reason unadvisable,
                    it is at liberty to reject them, the responsibility of doing so resting entirely
                    upon itself. The effect of this latitude is to give the company ample discretion
                    in the matter, and to enable the act to be administered and the object of it to
                    be attained without undue interference.</p>
               <p>In 1889 a very important act was passed placing upon the Board of Trade the
                    obligation to call upon railway companies throughout the United Kingdom (1) to
                    adopt upon all passenger lines the “ block ” system of working;</p>
               <p>(2) to “ interlock ” their points and signals; (3) to fit all trains carrying
                    passengers with some form of automatic continuous brake. Prior to this some
                    companies had, to a certain extent, done these things, but few, if any, were
                    completely equipped in these respects. A reasonable period was afforded them,
                    according to circumstances, to comply with these requirements, and at the
                    present time the work is practically complete. In this respect the lines of the
                    United Kingdom are far ahead of those of any other country, and a diminution of
                    accidents, particularly of collisions, has resulted therefrom. America is now
                    following the lead thus set, and all the most important lines in the United
                    States have adopted block working and interlocking, but a great deal still
                    remains to be done. In certain respects, on the other hand, America has gone
                    further than the United Kingdom, especially in the matter of automatic
                    signalling, and in the operating of points and signals by electrical power or
                    air-pressure instead of manual labour. In America, also, freight trains are
                    fitted with an automatic continuous brake, whereas in the United Kingdom this
                    appliance is required by law only in the case of passenger trains, and in fact
                    is not fitted to goods and mineral trains except in a few isolated instances.</p>
               <p>The above-named acts enable the Board of Trade to take all the necessary steps
                    to ensure that the safety of passenger trains is sufficiently guarded. More
                    recently legislation has been passed to safeguard the lives and interests of
                    railway servants. In 1893 an act was passed by parliament giving the Board power
                    to interfere if or when representations are made to them by or on behalf of any
                    servant or class of servants of a railway company that the hours of work are
                    unduly long, or do not provide sufficient intervals of uninterrupted rest
                    between the periods of duty, or sufficient relief in respect of Sunday duty. In
                    such cases the company concerned may, after inquiry, be called upon to submit
                    such a</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0828" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0853.jp2"/>
               <p>schedule of the hours during which the man or men are em-ployed as will bring
                    those hours within limits which appear to the department reasonable. In the
                    event of the company failing to comply with the demands of the department, the
                    latter is empowered to refer the case to the Railway and Canal Commissioners,
                    who form a special Court constituted by the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of
                    1888, for deciding, among other things, questions relating to rates and charges,
                    for protecting traders from undue charges and undue preference, for regulating
                    questions of traffic, and for deciding certain disputes between railway
                    companies and the public. The Commissioners are then empowered to deal with the
                    matter, and if “ a railway company fail to comply with any order made by the
                    Railway and Canal Commissioners, or to enforce the provisions of any schedule ”
                    approved by them, it is liable to a fine of a hundred pounds for every day
                    during which the default continues. This act has been the means of effecting a
                    considerable reduction in the hours worked by railway men on certain railways,
                    and no case has yet arisen in which a reference to the Commissioners has been
                    necessary. Such modifications of the hours of work have not only been beneficial
                    to the men, but have improved the discipline of the staff and the punctuality
                    and regularity of the train service, particularly in respect of the goods
                    trains.</p>
               <p>The Notice of Accidents Act of 1884, which obliges employers of labour to report
                    to the Board of Trade, when “there occurs in any employment ” as defined by the
                    schedule of the act, “any accident which causes to any person employed therein,
                    either loss of life or such bodily injury as to prevent him on any one of the
                    three working days next after the occurrence of the accident from being employed
                    for five hours on his ordinary work, ” affects railways in course of
                    construction, but not, as a rule, otherwise.</p>
               <p>Although the administration of the above-mentioned acts of parliament has had a
                    beneficial effect upon the safety of the public, and has enabled an enormous
                    volume of traffic to be handled with celerity, punctuality and absence of risk,
                    it has during recent years come to notice that the number of casualties among
                    railway servants is still unduly great, and in 1899 a Royal Commission was
                    appointed to in-vestigate the causes of the numerous accidents, fatal and
                    non-fatal, to railway men. As a consequence of the report of this Commission the
                    Railway Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act of 1900 was passed, putting
                    upon the Board of Trade the duty of making “ such rules as they think fit with
                    respect to any of the subjects mentioned in the schedule to this act, with the
                    object of reducing or removing the dangers and risks incidental to railway
                    service. ’’ Rules may also be made in respect to other matters besides those
                    mentioned in the schedule, and companies may be called upon to adopt or reject,
                    as the case may be, any appliance, the use or disuse of which may be considered
                    desirable in the interest of the men. Before, however, the rules so made become
                    binding upon the companies, the latter have the right of appealing against them
                    to the Railway Commissioners. Failure to comply with any of the rules renders a
                    company “ liable for each offence, on conviction under the Summary Jurisdiction
                    Acts, to a fine not exceeding fifty pounds, or in the case of a continuing
                    offence to a fine not exceeding ten pounds for every day during which the
                    offence continues after con-viction. ” Rules drafted by the Board of Trade under
                    this act came into force on the 8th of August 1902, the subjects referred to
                    being (1) labelling of wagons; (2) movements of wagons by propping and
                    tow-roping; (3) power-brakes on engines; (4) lighting of stations and sidings;
                    (5) protection of points, rods, &amp;c.; (6) construction and protection of
                    gauge-glasses; (7) arrangement of tool-boxes, &amp;c., on engines; (8)
                    provision of brake-vans for trains upon running lines beyond the limits of
                    stations; (9) protection to permanent-way men when relaying or repairing
                    permanent way. The final settlement of a rule requiring brake-levers to be
                    fitted on both sides of goods-wagons was, however, deferred, owing to objections
                    raised by certain of</p>
               <p>the railway companies.</p>
               <p>Other acts which are of importance in connexion with accidents are the Accidents
                    Compensation Act of 1846, the Employers’ Liability Act of 1880, and the
                    Workmen’s Compensation Act of 1897.</p>
               <p>The public acts of parliament referring to British railways are collected in

               <p><hi rend="smallcaps">American Railway Legislation</hi></p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Before 1870.</hi> —The earliest legislation is contained in
                    charters granted by special act, for the construction of railways. These special
                    acts gradually gave way to general statutes under which railway corporations
                    could be created without application to the legislature. In the east, where, as
                    a rule, charters had been uniform and consistent, the change to general
                    incorporation law was due to a desire to render incorporations speedier and less
                    expensive. In the west, general laws came rather as a result of the abuses of
                    special legislation. By 1850, general incorporation laws were found in nearly
                    all the eastern states, and by 1870 in those of the west.</p>
               <p>Early legislation was confined almost entirely to matters of construction. In
                    cases where statutes did touch the question of regulation, they had to do with
                    the operation of trains and with the provision of facilities for shippers and
                    passengers, rather than with questions of rates. It was natural that this should
                    be so, for the new transportation agency was so much more efficient than
                    anything previously available that the people were eager to take advantage of
                    its superior service. As a rule, the making of rates was left to the
                    corporations. If the maximum rates were prescribed, as they sometimes were, the
                    limit was placed so high as to be of no practical value for control. Such crude
                    attempts as were made to prevent rates from being excessive concerned themselves
                    with profits, and were designed to confiscate for the state treasury any
                    earnings beyond a certain prescribed dividend. Publicity of rates was not
                    generally required, and provisions against discrimination were rare. In the
                    period before 1850 there was but little realization of the public nature of the
                    railway industry and of the possibilities of injury to the public if railway
                    corporations were left uncontrolled.</p>
               <p>In regions where capital was lacking eagerness for railway facilities led the
                    people to demand the direct co-operation of the state, and many projects, most
                    of which ended in disaster, were undertaken either by the state itself or
                    through the aid of the state’s credit. For example, Michigan, in 1837, in the
                    first session of its state legislature, made plans for the construction of 557
                    miles of railway under the direct control of the state, and the governor was
                    authorized to issue bonds for the purpose. The unfortunate results of this
                    policy led many of the states, from about 1850, to put constitutional
                    limitations upon the power of their legislatures to lend the state’s credit or
                    to involve the state as stockholder in the affairs of any corporation.</p>
               <p>As railway building increased in response to traffic needs, and as the
                    consolidation of short lines into continuous systems proceeded, legislation
                    applicable to railways became somewhat broader in scope and more intelligent.
                    About 1850 there began to appear on the statute books laws requiring publicity
                    of rates and the submission of annual reports to the legislature, prescribing
                    limits to corporate indebtedness, and also making provision for safety in
                    operation and for the character and quality of railway service. Consolidation
                    and leasing were commonly permitted in the case of continuous lines, but were
                    regularly prohibited in the case of parallel and competing lines. The practice
                    of pooling seems not to have attracted the attention of the legislature. In
                    general it may be asserted that legis-lation of this period was ill-considered,
                    haphazard, and on a petty scale. Moreover, it was of little practical importance
                    even within its narrow range, for it does not appear to have been generally
                    enforced.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">1870-1900. —</hi> Railway legislation first assumed
                    importance in connection with the “ Granger Movement ” in the middle west. There
                    the policy of subsidies for railway building had been carried to a reckless
                    extreme. Roads had been constructed in advance of settlement, and land-seekers
                    had been</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0829" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0854.jp2"/>
               <p>transported to these frontier sections only to become dependent upon the
                    railways for their very existence. To the unusual temptations thus offered for
                    favouritism and discriminations in rates, the railways generally yielded. This
                    preferential and discriminating policy, combined with other causes which cannot
                    here be discussed, resulted in the Granger legislation of the ’seventies. In the
                    first instance laws were enacted prescribing schedules of maximum freight and
                    passenger rates with stringent penalties against rebates and discriminations.
                    These measures proving unsatisfactory, they were soon superseded by statutes
                    creating railway commissions with varied powers of regulation. The commission
                    method of control was not a new one. Such bodies, established to appraise land
                    for railway purposes, to apportion receipts and expenditures of interstate
                    traffic, and in a general way to supervise railway transportation, had been in
                    existence in New England before 186o, one of the earliest being that of Rhode
                    Island in 1839. In 1869 Massachusetts had instituted a commission of more modern
                    type, which was given only powers of investigation and recommendation, the force
                    of public opinion being relied upon to make its orders effective. Western
                    commissions, the offspring of the Granger movement, were of a more vigorous
                    type. Most of them had power to impose schedules of maximum rates; practically
                    all of them had authority to prescribe rates upon complaint of shippers; and
                    they could all seek the aid of the courts to enforce their decrees. Their power
                    to initiate rates, conferred upon them by their legislatures, was sustained by
                    the Supreme Court of the United States, the Court reserving to itself only the
                    power to decide whether the prescribed rates were reasonable.</p>
               <p>But the jurisdiction of the state commissions was, by judicial interpretation,
                    limited to commerce beginning and ending within the limits of the single state.
                    The most important part of railway transportation, that which was interstate in
                    character, was left untouched. It was this impotence of the state commission
                    that furnished the strongest incentive to Congressional action. The result was
                    the passage, in 1887, of the Interstate Commerce Act, which was directed towards
                    the extirpation of illegal and unjust practices in commerce among the states.
                    Its primary purpose was to embody in statutory form the common-law principle of
                    equal treatment under like circumstances, and to provide machinery for
                    enforcement. It aimed at the prohibition of discrimination between persons,
                    places and commodities. It made provision for publicity of rates and for due
                    notice of any change in rates; it forbade pooling of freight or earnings, and
                    required annual reports from the carriers. For its enforcement, it created an
                    Interstate Commerce Commission of five members, with powers of investigation,
                    and with authority to issue remedial orders upon complaint and after hearing.
                    Findings of the Commission were to be prima facie evidence in any court
                    proceeding for the enforcement of its orders.</p>
               <p>In this connexion, reference should be made to the Anti-Trust Act of 1890,
                    which, by its judicial interpretation, has been held to include railways and to
                    forbid rate agreements between competing carriers.</p>
               <p>The act of 1887 remained in force without substantial amendment until 1906,
                    although with constantly diminishing prestige, a result largely due to adverse
                    decisions concerning the powers of the Commission. Ten years after the passage
                    of the law, the court decided that the Commission had no power to prescribe a
                    rate, and that its jurisdiction over rates was confined to a determination of
                    the question whether the rate complained of was unreasonable. The Commission had
                    much difficulty at the beginning in securing the testimony of witnesses, who
                    invoked the Constitution of the United States as a bar against
                    self-incrimination, and the immunity clause of the act had to be amended before
                    testimony could be obtained. The so-called “ long-and-short-haul clause, ” which
                    forbade a greater charge for a long than for a short haul over the same line, if
                    circum-stances were substantially similar, was also robbed of all its vitality
                    by court decision. The section requiring annual reports, while it led to the
                    creation of a Bureau of Statistics, did not give the Commission power to compel
                    complete or satisfactory answers to its requests for information. The only
                    element of real strength that the statute acquired during the first twenty years
                    of its history came from the Elkins Act of 1903, which stipulated that the
                    published rate should be the legal rate, and declared any departure from the
                    published rate to be a misdemeanour. It held shipper as well as carrier, and
                    corporation as well as its officer or agent, liable for violations of the act,
                    and conferred upon United States courts power to employ equity processes in
                    putting an end to discrimination. Conviction for granting rebates was by this
                    law made easier and more effective.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Since 1900. —</hi> The movement in favour of more vigorous
                    railway regulation became pronounced after 1900. Twenty years of experience and
                    observation had revealed the defects of the earlier legislation, and had
                    concentrated public attention more intelligently than ever before upon the
                    problem of strengthening the weak spots. The state commissions, since their
                    establishment in the ’seventies and the ’eighties, had increased their functions
                    and influence. Many of them, beginning only with powers of recommendation, had
                    obtained a large extension of authority. By 1908, thirty-five of the forty state
                    commissions were of the mandatory type, and thirteen of these had been created
                    since 1904. They had been given power to require complete annual reports from
                    carriers, with a consequent great increase in public knowledge concerning
                    railway operation and practice. The most recent type of state commission is the
                    so-called Public Utility Commission, of which the best examples are those of New
                    York and Wisconsin, established in 1907. In both states, the Commissions have
                    power over electric railways and local public utilities furnishing heat, light
                    and power, as well as over steam railway transportation, and the Wisconsin
                    Commission also has control over telephone companies. In both states the consent
                    of the Commission is necessary for the issue of corporate securities.</p>
               <p>Mention should be made of the mass of general legislation passed, principally by
                    western states, since 1905, in response to a popular demand for lower rates.
                    This demand has in many instances led to ill-considered legislation, has
                    frequently ignored the prerogatives and even the existence of the state
                    commissions, and has brought about the passage by state legislatures of maximum
                    freight and passenger rate laws, with rates so low in many cases that they have
                    been set aside by the courts as unconstitutional. The numerous laws limiting the
                    fare for passengers to two cents per mile are an illustration of this tendency.</p>
               <p>In the field of federal legislation, no significant change took place until the
                    passage of the Hepburn Act of 1906, which was an amendment of the act of 1887.
                    While failing to correct all the defects in the original statute, the amended
                    law was a decided step in the direction of efficient regulation. It increased
                    the jurisdiction of the Commission by placing under the act express companies,
                    sleeping-car companies and pipe lines for the transportation of oil. It extended
                    the meaning of the term “ railroad ” to include switches, spurs and terminal
                    facilities, and the term “ transportation ” to include private cars, and all
                    collateral services, such as refrigeration, elevation and storage. The Elkins
                    Act of 1903 was incorporated in the statute, and an imprisonment penalty was
                    added to the existing fine. It forbade the granting of passes except to certain
                    specified classes, —a provision entirely absent from the original measure. It
                    expressly conferred upon the Commission the power to prescribe maximum rates,
                    upon complaint and after hearing, as well as to make joint rates, and to
                    establish through rates when the carriers had themselves refused to do so. It
                    enacted that published rates should not be changed except on thirty days’
                    notice, whether the change involved an increase or a decrease, and it required
                    annual reports to be made under oath, penalties being prescribed for failure to
                    comply with the Commission’s requests for information. Power was also given to
                    prescribe uniform systems of accounts for all classes of carriers, and to employ
                    special examiners to inspect the books and accounts. Carriers were forbidden to
                    keep any accounts, records or memoranda other than those approved by the
                    Commission.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0830" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0855.jp2"/>
               <p>Orders of the Commission became effective within such time, not less than thirty
                    days, as the Commission should prescribe, and penalties began to take effect
                    from the date fixed by the Commission, unless the carrier secured an injunction
                    from the Court suspending the order. Such injunction might not issue except
                    after hearing, of which five days’ notice must be given. Decisions of the
                    Commission were not reviewable by the Court unless the Commission had exceeded
                    its authority, or had issued an unconstitutional order.</p>
               <p>A new and important act was signed by the President on the 18th of June 1910. It
                    created a Commerce Court (composed of five judges nominated by the president of
                    the United States from the Federal circuit judges), transferred to it
                    jurisdiction in cases instituted to enforce or set aside orders of the
                    Inter-State Commerce Commission, and made the United States instead of the
                    Commission a party in all such actions. The law forbids a railway or any other
                    common carrier to charge more for a short haul than for a long haul over the
                    same line, unless, in special cases, it is authorized to do so by the
                    Commission. It forbids a railway which has reduced its rates while in
                    competition with a water route to raise them again when the competition has
                    ceased, unless the Commission permits it to do so because of other changed
                    conditions. It extends the initiative of the Commission from the investigation
                    of complaints to the investigation of rates on its own motion; authorizes it to
                    suspend rates in advance of their going into effect, pending an investigation
                    which may be continued for ten months, and to establish through routes; and
                    provides for a special commission, appointed by the President, to investigate
                    questions pertaining to the issuance of railway securities.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Accident Statistics</hi></p>
               <p>Statistics of railway accidents may be divided into three classes: casualties ( <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ) to passengers, ( <hi rend="italic">b</hi> )
                    to servants or <hi rend="italic">employés</hi> and (r) to other persons; and
                    again into (1) train accidents,</p>
               <p>(2) accidents to persons doing work on or about trains and</p>
               <p>(3) other accidents.</p>
               <p>Such statistics are studied mainly with the object of learning the lessons which
                    they may afford as to preventive measures for the future; and from this point of
                    view the most important element is the single item of passengers killed in train
                    accidents ( <hi rend="italic">a</hi> 1). The number injured is, indeed, a fact
                    of interest, no less than the number killed, but comparisons under this head are
                    unsatisfactory because it is impracticable or unprofitable to go into sufficient
                    detail to determine the relative seriousness of the injuries. The statistics of
                    the killed usually afford all necessary stimulus to improvement. Accidents to
                    passengers other than those caused by collisions or derailments of trains are
                    very largely due to causes which it is fair to class either as unavoidable or as
                    due mainly to the fault or carelessness of the victim himself. That this is so
                    is indicated by the fact that, although the railways—always made to suffer
                    severely in pecuniary damages for injuries for which their officers or servants
                    are held responsible by the courts—have for years taken almost every conceivable
                    precaution, the number of accidents, in proportion to the number of persons
                    travelling, diminishes but slowly—so slowly that, in view of the variety of
                    conditions to be considered, it would hardly be safe to conclude that the
                    diminution is due to any definite improvement in the safeguards provided.
                    Collisions, on the other hand, are preventable, and derailments nearly so, and
                    the records of deaths and injuries in this class in successive years are
                    therefore justly taken as an index to the efficiency with which the railways are
                    managed.</p>
               <p>The number of servants killed in train accidents is the next in importance. The
                    safety of passengers is, indeed, the first care of the railway manager; but the <hi rend="italic">employés,</hi> exposed to many risks from which the
                    passengers are protected, must be looked after. On the British railways the men
                    who run the trains are safeguarded very efficiently, and the collisions and
                    derailments which are serious enough to do injury to the trainmen or the
                    enginemen are really rare. The roadway, tracks and rolling stock are so well
                    maintained that those causes which lead to the worst derailments have been
                    eliminated almost completely, and the record of serious collisions has been
                    reduced nearly to zero by the universal use of the block system and by
                    systematic precautions at junctions. In America the record is far less
                    satisfactory. The best railways of the United States and Canada have, indeed,
                    been greatly improved, and their main lines approach the high standards of
                    safety which prevail in Great Britain, both as regards maintenance and care of
                    roadway and vehicles (as a preventive of derailments) and the use of the block
                    system (as a preventive of collisions); but when the inquirer looks at America
                    as a whole—the total length of lines in the United States being over 230,000 m.,
                    ten times the total of the United Kingdom—he is considering a figure which
                    includes an enormous mileage of railway lying in thinly settled regions where
                    the high standards of safety maintained on the best railways have scarcely been
                    thought of. The duty of a railway with deficient plant or facilities would seem
                    to be to make up for their absence by moderating the speeds of its trains, but
                    public sentiment in America appears so far to have' approved, at least tacitly,
                    the combination of imperfect railways and high speeds.</p>
               <p>Apart from collisions and derailments, a large proportion of all accidents is
                    found to be due primarily to want of care on the part of the victims. Accidents
                    to workmen in marshalling, shunting, distributing and running trains, engines
                    and cars, may be taken as the most important class, after train accidents,
                    because this work is necessary and important and yet involves considerable
                    hazard. On British railways the duty of the companies to provide all practicable
                    safeguards and to educate and caution the servants may be said to have been
                    faithfully performed, and the accident totals must be taken as being somewhat
                    near the “ irreducible minimum’’ —unless some of the infirmities of the human
                    mind can be cured. In America the number of men killed and injured in handling
                    freight trains has been very large. In the year ending June 30, 1909, exclusive
                    of casualties due to collisions, derailments and other accidents to trains, the
                    number killed was 811 and of injured 28,156 ( <hi rend="italic">Accident
                        Bulletin,</hi> No. 32, p. 14). The number killed (811) is equal to about
                    three in every thousand trainmen employed. From this and all other causes, the
                    number of trainmen killed in the year ending June 30, 1909, was about 8 in 1000.</p>
               <p>The use of automatic couplers for freight cars throughout the United States,
                    introduced in 1893-1900, greatly reduced the number of deaths and injuries in
                    coupling, and the use of air brakes on freight cars, now universal, has reduced
                    the risk to the men by making it less necessary for them to ride on the roofs of
                    high box-cars, while at the same time it has made it possible to run long trains
                    with fewer men; but except in these two features the freight service in America
                    continues to be a dangerous occupation. The high and heavy cars, the high
                    speeds, the severe weather in the northern states in winter, the fluctuating
                    nature of the business, resulting often in the employment of poorly qualified
                    men and in other irregularities, are among the causes of this state of things.</p>
               <p>Being struck or run over by a train while standing or walking on the track is
                    the largest single cause of “ railway accidents. ” Workmen are killed and
                    injured in this way, both while on duty and when going to and from their work;
                    passengers, with or without right, go in front of trains at stations and at
                    highway crossings at grade level; and trespassers are killed and injured in
                    large numbers on railways everywhere, at and near stations, at crossings, and
                    out on the open road, where they have no shadow of right. Of trespassers the
                    number killed per mile of</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0831" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0856.jp2"/>
               <p>line is about as large in England as in America, the density of population and
                    of traffic in Great Britain apparently counter-balancing the laxity of the laws
                    against trespassing in America. In the thickly settled parts of the United
                    States the number of trespassers killed on the railway tracks, including
                    vagrants who suffer in collisions and derailments while stealing rides, is very
                    large. In New York and four adjacent states, having about as many miles of
                    railway as the United Kingdom, the number in the year ending June 30, 1907, was
                    1552. In the United Kingdom the number for the corresponding year was 447, or
                    less than one-third.</p>
               <p>As was suggested at the outset, railway accident statistics are useful only as
                    showing how to make life and limb safer, though in pursuing this object
                    increased economy should also be secured. Railways have always been held by the
                    legislatures and by the courts strictly accountable for their shortcomings, so
                    far as accountability can be enforced by compelling the payment of damages to
                    victims of accidents; but in spite of this, a want of enterprise and even some
                    apparent neglect of passengers’ and servants’ plain rights, have often been
                    apparent, and the Board of Trade, with its powers of supervision, inspection and
                    investigation, must therefore be classed as one of the most beneficent factors
                    in the promotion of safety on British railways. Its powers have been exercised
                    with the greatest caution, yet with consistent firmness; and the publicity which
                    has been given to the true and detailed causes of scores and scores of railway
                    accidents by the admirable reports of the Board of Trade inspectors has been a
                    powerful lever in improving the railway service. Useful compulsory laws
                    regarding the details of train management are difficult to frame and hard to
                    carry out; but the Board has exercised a persistent persuasiveness and has
                    secured most of its objects. Its investigations justified the law making the
                    block system compulsory, thus removing the worst danger of railway travel. Its
                    constant and impartial expositions of cases of over-work and insufficient
                    training of <hi rend="italic">employés</hi> have greatly helped to elevate the
                    character of these <hi rend="italic">employés.</hi></p>
               <p>In the United States the governments have done far less. A majority of the
                    states have railway commissions, but the investigation of railway accidents,
                    with comparatively few exceptions, has not been done in such a way as to make
                    the results useful in promoting improved practice. Many of the commissions have
                    done little or nothing of value in this respect. The Federal government, having
                    authority in railway matters only when interstate traffic is affected, gathers
                    statistics and publishes them; but in the airing of causes—the field in which
                    the British Board of Trade has been so useful—nothing so far has been done
                    except to require written reports monthly from the railways. These are useful so
                    far as they go, but they lack the impartiality that would be secured by an
                    inquiry such as is held in England.</p>

               <p>The casualties enumerated in items 1, 4 and 7 of Table X. aggregate 6 killed and
                    454 injured; the six deaths were due to collisions, while of the cases of injury
                    372 occurred by collisions, 47 by derail-meπts, and 35 by other accidents to
                    trains. This undoubtedly is the greatest record for train safety ever known in
                    the world. Item 1 shows no passengers killed in train accidents during the year.
                    This was the case once before, in 1901; and the total of fatal accidents to
                    passengers and servants, taken together, has in several years been very low
                    (1896, eight; 1901, eight; 1902, ten; 1904, thirteen), but never before was it
                    down to six.</p>

               <p><hi rend="italic">Railway Accidents in America. —</hi> The statistics of
                    accidents in America are kept in a form somewhat different from the fore-going.
                    Table XIV. is taken from the Accident Bulletin of the Interstate Commerce
                    Commission (No. 32), the items being numbered to correspond as nearly as
                    practicable with the numbers in the British table (No. X. ). The items 7-8
                    embrace the statistics which most nearly correspond to the items 7-12 in the
                    British table.</p>
               <p>The salient feature of Table XIV. is the diminution from 1908 to 1909. This is
                    mainly due to a great falling off in traffic, because of a general business
                    depression; from 1907 to 1909 the reduction in the accident record is still
                    greater. In items 1 and 4 the increase in safety is due in part, no doubt, to
                    the extension of the use of the block system. The accidents to “ other persons ”
                    cannot readily be compared with items 7-12 in the British record, except as to
                    the totals and a few of the items.</p>
               <p>ln any comparison between British and American records the first point to be
                    borne in mind is the difference in mileage and traffic. The American railways
                    aggregate approximately ten times the length of the British lines; but in train
                    miles the difference is far less. In the latest years in which comparisons can
                    be made, the passenger journeys in the United Kingdom amounted to 1500 millions
                    (including season-ticket holders, estimated) and the train miles to 428∙3
                    millions, while the corresponding figures in the United States were 873·9
                    millions and 1171∙9 millions. The average length</p>

               <p>Table XV. shows the casualties on American railways in 1907 and 1908 (year
                    ending June 30). These figures differ from those in Table XIV. because of
                    differences in classification. In Table XIV. the item “ passengers killed ”
                    includes those on some electric railways, which presumably are not covered in
                    the statement here given; also passengers in freight trains, &amp;c. Under “
                    employees ” this table includes men in shops, &amp;c., not shown in Table
                    XIV.</p>
               <p>In 1907 one passenger in 2, 318, 051 was killed, and one in 107, 004 was
                    injured, in train accidents. The number of <hi rend="italic">employés</hi> killed in train accidents was 12∙9 in 10 million train miles. Of train men
                    (including engine-drivers and firemen), one out of 125 employed was killed (all
                    causes), and one in eight injured.</p>
               <p>The great differences between the records of the United States and the United
                    Kingdom seem to afford justification for the view, which has often been
                    expressed, that in America the spirit of hurry and recklessness manifest in many
                    of the activities of the people prevails even among the men on whom rests the
                    grave responsibility of running trains in safety. Yet the best safety devices
                    are made in America, and means of reducing these death records are well known.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">France. —</hi> Railway accidents in France are recorded in a
                    shape somewhat different from that found in either Great Britain or America. The
                    principal items for the years 1906 and 1907 are shown in Table XVI. The length
                    of railways in the republic was 39, 963 km. (24, 832 m. ), the number of persons
                    employed on them was rather less than 300, 000, the number of pas-sengers
                    carried annually being between 450 and 500 millions. The number of passengers
                    (36) killed in train accidents in 1907 was equal to 0·0759 Per million
                    passengers carried and 0∙0024 per million kilometres travelled by passengers, or
                    0∙1503 per million kilometres travelled by trains.</p>

               <p>The most significant item in the table, 36 passengers killed in train accidents,
                    is perhaps to be considered as abnormally large, the totals under this head for
                    the preceding six years beginning with 1901 being 7, 35, 3, 18, 4, 14, or an
                    average of 11∙57 per year. The French secretary of Public Works, who has
                    furnished these statistics, keeps also similar records of the local or light
                    railways, on which the number of fatal accidents appears to be exceedingly
                    small.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Germany. —</hi> The number of persons killed on the railways
                    of the German Empire in the year 1907 was 1249, classified as in Table XVII.
                    This number does not include suicides and attempts at suicide, of which there
                    were 333, all but 24 being successful. In these statistics, the third item, “
                    other persons, ” includes post office and customs officials and other persons
                    connected with the railway service, as well as railway officers and servants off
                    duty. The totals of passengers killed and</p>
               <p>injured in train accidents are not separated from those killed and injured from
                    other causes, but ratios are given showing that for four years no passengers
                    were killed in this class.</p>

               <p>The methods of financing railway enterprises, both new projects and existing
                    lines, have been influenced very largely by the attitude of the state and of
                    municipal authorities. Railways may be built for military reasons or for
                    commercial reasons, or for a combination of the two. The Trans-Siberian railway
                    was a military necessity if Russia was to exercise dominion throughout Siberia
                    and maintain a port on the Yellow Sea or the Sea of Japan. The Union Pacific
                    railroad was a military necessity to the United States if the authority of the
                    national government was to be maintained in the Far West. The cost of such
                    ventures and the detailed methods by which they are financed are of relatively
                    small importance, because they are not required to earn a money return on the
                    investment. To a less degree, the same is true of railways built for a special
                    instead of a general commercial interest. The Baltimore &amp; Ohio railroad
                    was built to protect and further the commercial interests of the city of
                    Baltimore; the Cincinnati Southern railway is still owned by the city of
                    Cincinnati, which built the line in the ’seventies for commercial protection
                    against Louis-ville, Ky. From a commercial point of view such ventures are
                    differentiated from railway projects built for general commercial reasons
                    because they do not depend on their own credit. The government, national or
                    local, furnishes the borrowing power, and makes the best bargain it can with the
                    men it designates to operate the line.</p>
               <p>Where a railway is built for general commercial reasons, however, it must
                    furnish its own credit; that is to say, it must convince investors that it can
                    be worked profitably and give them an assured return on the funds they advance.
                    The state is interested in the commercial railway venture as a matter of public
                    policy, and because it can confer or wîthold the right of eminent domain,
                    without which the railway builder would be subjected to endless annoyance and
                    expense. This govern-mental sanction has been obtainable only with difficulty,
                    and after the exercise of numerous legal forms, in Great Britain and on the
                    continent of Europe. In the United States, on the other hand, it has been
                    obtained with considerable ease. In the earlier years of American railway
                    building, each project was commonly the subject of a special law; then special
                    laws were in turn succeeded by general railway laws in the several states, and
                    these in turn have come to be succeeded in most parts of the country by
                    jurisdiction vested in the state railway commission. Each of these changes has
                    tended to improve the existing status, to legitimize railway enterprise, and to
                    safe-guard capital or investment.</p>
               <p>The laws regulating original outputs for capital were strictly drawn in Great
                    Britain and on the continent of Europe; in America they were drawn very loosely.
                    As a result it has been far easier for the American than for the European
                    railway builder to take advantage of the speculative instinct in obtaining
                    money. Instead of the borrowing power being restricted to a small percentage of
                    the total capital, as in European countries, most of the railway mileage of
                    America has been built with borrowed money, represented by bonds, while stock
                    has been given freely as an inducement to subscribe to the bonds on the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0834" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0859.jp2"/>
               <p>theory that the bonds represented the cost of the enterprise, and the stock the
                    prospective profits. As a natural result weak railway companies in the United
                    States have frequently been declared insolvent by the courts, owing to their
                    inability in periods of commercial depression to meet their acknowledged
                    obligations, and in the reorganization which has followed the shareholders have
                    usually had to accept a loss, temporary or permanent.</p>
               <p>The situation in Great Britain has been wholly different. The debt in that
                    country is relatively small in amount, and is not represented by securities
                    based upon hypothecation of the company’s real property, as with the American
                    railway bond, resting on a first, second or third mortgage. But British share
                    capital has been issued so freely for extension and improvement work of all
                    sorts, including the costly requirements of the Board of Trade, that a situation
                    has been reached where the return on the outstanding securities tends to
                    diminish year by year. Although this fact will not in itself make the companies
                    liable to any process of reorganization similar to that following insolvency and
                    foreclosure of the American railway, it is probable that reorganization of some
                    sort must nevertheless take place in Great Britain, and it may well be
                    questioned whether the position of the transportation system of that country
                    would not have been better if it had been built up and projected on the
                    experience gained by actual earlier losses, as in the United States.</p>
               <p>Thus the characteristic defect in the British railway organization has been the
                    tendency to put out new capital at a rate faster than has been warranted by the
                    annual increases in earnings. The American railways do not have to face this
                    situation; but, after a long term of years, when they were allowed to do much as
                    they pleased, they have now been brought sharply to book by almost every form of
                    constituted authority to be found in the states, and they are suffering from
                    increased taxation, from direct service requirements, and from a general
                    tendency on the part of regulating authorities to reduce rates and to make it
                    impossible to increase them. Meantime, the purchasing power of the dollar which
                    the railway company receives for a specified service is gradually growing
                    smaller, owing to the general increases year by year in wages and in the cost of
                    material. The railways are prospering because they are managed with great skill
                    and are doing increasing amounts of business, though at lessening unit profits.
                    But there is danger of their reaching the point where there is little or no
                    margin between unit costs of service and unit receipts for the service. It will
                    probably be inevitable for American railway rates to trend somewhat upward in
                    the future, as they have gradually declined in the past; but the process
                    apparently cannot be accomplished without considerable friction with the
                    governing authorities. The attitude of the courts is not that the railways
                    should work without compensation, but that the compensation should not exceed a
                    fair return on funds actually expended by the railway. This is in line with the
                    provisions in the Constitution of the United States regarding the protection of
                    property, but the difficulty in applying the principle to the railway situation
                    lies in the fact that costs have to be met by averaging the returns on the total
                    amount of business done, and it is often impossible, in specific instances, to
                    secure a rate which can be considered to yield a fair return on the specific
                    service rendered. Hence losses in one quarter must be compensated by gains in
                    another—a process which the law, regarding only the gains, renders very
                    difficult.</p>
               <p>The growth of railways has been accompanied by a world-wide tendency toward the
                    consolidation of small independent ventures into large groups of lines able to
                    aid one another in the exchange of traffic and to effect economies in
                    administration and in the purchase of supplies. Both in England and in America
                    this process of consolidation has been obstructed by all known legislative
                    devices, because of the widespread belief that competition in the field of
                    transportation was necessary if fair prices were to be charged for the service.
                    But the general tendency to regulate rates by authority of the state has
                    apparently rendered unnecessary the old plan of rate regulation through
                    competition,</p>
               <p>even if it had not been demonstrated often and again that this form of
                    regulation is costly for all concerned and is effective only during rare periods
                    of direct conflict between companies. Nevertheless, in spite of difficulties,
                    consolidation has gone on with great rapidity. When Mr E. H. Harriman died he
                    exercised direct authority over more than 50, 000 m. of railway, and the
                    tendency of all the great American railway systems, even when not tied to one
                    another in common owner-ship, is to increase their mileage year by year by
                    acquiring tributary lines. The smaller company exchanges its stock for stock of
                    the larger system on an agreed basis, or sells it outright, and the bondholders
                    of the absorbed line often have a similar opportunity to exchange their
                    securities for obligations of the parent company, which are on a stronger basis
                    or have a broader market. Similarly in Great Britain there is a tendency towards
                    combination by mutual agreement among the companies while they still preserve
                    their independent existence.</p>

               <p><hi rend="italic">Location. —</hi> An ideal line of railway connecting two
                    terminal points would be perfectly level and perfectly straight, because in that
                    case the resistance due to gradients and curves would be eliminated (see § <hi
                        rend="italic"> Locomotive Power}</hi> and the cost of mechanical operation
                    reduced to a minimum. But that ideal is rarely if ever attainable. In the first
                    place the route of a railway must be governed by commercial considerations.
                    Unless it be quite short, it can scarcely ever be planned simply to connect its
                    two terminal points, without regard to the intervening country; in order to be
                    of the greatest utility and to secure the greatest revenue it must be laid out
                    with due consideration of the traffic</p>

               <p>arising at intermediate places, and as these will not usually lie exactly on the
                    direct line, deviations from straightness will be rendered necessary. In the
                    second place, except in the unlikely event of all the places on the selected
                    route lying at the same elevation, a line that is perfectly level is a physical
                    impossibility; and from engineering considerations, even one with uniform
                    gradients will be impracticable on the score of cost, unless the surface of the
                    country is extraordinarily even. In these circumstances the constructor has two
                    broad alternatives between which to choose. On the one hand he may make the line
                    follow the natural inequalities of the ground as nearly as may be, avoiding the
                    elevations and depressions by curves; or on the other he may aim at making it as
                    nearly straight and level as possible by taking it through the elevations in
                    cuttings or tunnels and across the depressions on embankments or bridges. He
                    will incline to the first of these alternatives when cheapness of first cost is
                    a desideratum, but, except in unusually favourable circumstances, the resulting
                    line, being full of sharp curves and severe gradients, will be unsuited for fast
                    running and will be unable to accommodate heavy traffic economically. If,
                    however, cost within reasonable limits is a secondary con-sidcration and the
                    intention is to build a line adapted for express trains and for the carriage of
                    the largest volume of traffic with speed and economy, he will lean towards the
                    second. In practice every line is a compromise between these two extremes ,
                    arrived at by carefully balancing a large number of varying factors. Other
                    things being equal, that route is best which will serve the district most
                    conveniently and secure the highest revenue; and the most favourable combination
                    of curves and gradients is that by which the annual cost of conveying the
                    traffic which the line will be called on to carry, added to the annual interest
                    on the capital expended in construction, will be made a minimum.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Cuttings and Embankments. —</hi> A cutting, or cut, is
                    simply a trench dug in a hill or piece of rising ground, wide enough at the
                    bottom to accommodate one or more pairs of rails, and deep enough to enable the
                    line to continue its course on the level or on a moderate gradient. The slopes
                    of the sides vary according to the nature of the ground, the amount of moisture
                    present, &amp;c. In solid rock they may be vertical; in gravel, sand or
                    common earth they must, to prevent slipping, rise 1 ft. for 1 to 1½ or 2 ft. of
                    base, or even more in treacherous clay. In soft material the excavation may be
                    performed by mechanical excavators or “ steam navvies, ’’ while in hard it may
                    be necessary to resort to blasting. Except in hard rock, the top width of a
                    cutting, and therefore the amount of material to be excavated, increases rapidly
                    with the depth; hence if a cutting exceeds a certain depth, which varies with
                    the particular circumstances, it may be more economical, instead of forming the
                    sides at the slope at which the material of which they are composed will stand,
                    to make them nearly vertical and support the soil with a retaining wall, or to
                    bore a tunnel. An embankment-bank, or fill, is the reverse of a cutting, being
                    an artificial mound of earth on which the railway is taken across depressions in
                    the surface of the ground. An endeavour is made so to plan the works of a
                    railway that the quantity of earth excavated in cuttings shall be equal to the
                    quantity required for the embankments; but this is not always practicable, and
                    it is sometimes advantageous to obtain the earth from some source close to the
                    embankment rather than incur the expense of hauling it from a distant cutting.
                    As embankments have to support the weight of heavy trains, they must be
                    uniformly firm and well drained, and before the line is fully opened for traffic
                    they must be allowed time to consolidate, a process which is helped by running
                    construction or mineral trains over them.</p>
               <p>An interesting case of embankment and cutting in combination was involved in
                    crossing Chat Moss on the Liverpool &amp; Manchester railway. The moss was
                    4½ m. across, and it varied in depth from 10 to 30 ft. Its general character was
                    such that cattle could not stand on it, and a piece of iron would sink in it.
                    The subsoil was composed principally of clay and sand, and the railway had to be
                    earned over the moss on the level, requiring cutting, and embanking for upwards
                    of. 4 m. In forming 277, 000 cub. yds. of embankment 670, 000 yds. 01 raw peat
                    were consumed, the difference being occasioned by the squeezing out of the
                    water. Large quantities of embanking were sunk in the moss, and, when the
                    engineer, George Stephenson, after a month’s vigorous operations, had made up
                    his estimates, the apparent work done was sometimes less than at the beginning
                    of the month. The railway ultimately was made to float on the bog. Where
                    embankment was required drains about 5 yds. apart were cut, and when the moss
                    between them was dry it was used to form the embankment. Where the way was
                    formed on the level, drains were cut on each side of the intended line, and were
                    intersected here and there by cross drains, by which the upper part of the moss
                    was rendered dry and firm. On this surface hurdles were placed, 4 ft. broad and
                    9 long, covered with heath, upon which the ballast was laid.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Bridges. —</hi> For conveying small streams through
                    embankments, channels or culverts are constructed in brickwork or masonry.
                    Larger rivers, canals, roads, other railways and sometimes deep narrow valleys
                    are crossed by bridges ( <hi rend="italic">q. v.</hi> ) of timber, brick,
                    stone, wrought iron or steel, and many of these structures rank among the
                    largest engineering works in the world. Sometimes also a viaduct consisting of a
                    series of arches is preferred to an embankment when the line has to be taken
                    over a piece of flat alluvial plain, or when it is desired to economize space
                    and to carry the line at a sufficient height to clear the streets, as in the
                    case of various railways entering London and other large towns. In connexion
                    with a railway many bridges have also to be constructed to carry public roads
                    and other railways over the line, and for the use of owners or tenants whose
                    land it has cut through (“ accommodation bridges ”). In the early days of
                    railways, roads were often taken across the line on the level, but such “ level
                    ” or “ grade ” crossings are now usually avoided in the case of new lines in
                    populous countries, except when the traffic on both the road and the railway is
                    very light. In many instances old level crossings have been replaced by
                    over-bridges with long sloping approaches; in this way considerable expenditure
                    has been involved, justified, however, by the removal of a danger to the public
                    and of interruptions to the traffic on both the roads and the railways. In cases
                    where the route of a line runs across a river or other piece of water so wide
                    that the construction of a bridge is either impossible or would be more costly
                    than is warranted by the volume of traffic, the expedient is some-times adopted
                    of carrying the wagons and carriages across bodily with their loads on train
                    ferries, so as to avoid the inconvenience and delay of transshipment. Such train
                    ferries arc common in America, especially on the Great Lakes, and exist at
                    several places in Europe, as in the Baltic between Denmark and Sweden and
                    Denmark and Germany, and across the Straits of Messina.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Gradients. —</hi> The gradient or grade of a line is the
                    rate at which it rises or falls, above or below the horizontal, and is expressed
                    by stating either the horizontal distance in which the change of level amounts
                    to 1 ft., or the amount of change that would occur in some selected distance,
                    such as 100 ft., 1000 ft. or 1 m. In America a gradient of 1 in 100 is often
                    known as a 1% grade, one of 2 in 100 as a 2% grade, and so on; thus a 0∙25%
                    grade corresponds to what in England would be known as a gradient of 1 in 400.
                    The ruling gradient of a section of railway is the steepest incline in that
                    section, and is so called because it governs or rules the maximum load that can
                    be placed behind an engine working over that portion of line. Sometimes,
                    however, a sharp incline occurring on an otherwise easy line is not reckoned as
                    the ruling gradient, trains heavier than could be drawn up it by a single engine
                    being helped by an assistant or “ bank ” engine; sometimes also “ momentum ” or
                    “ velocity ” grades, steeper than the ruling gradient, are permitted for short
                    distances in cases where a train can approach at full speed and thus surmount
                    them by the aid of its momentum. An incline of 1 in 400 is reckoned easy, of 1
                    in 200 moderate and of 1 in 100 heavy. The ruling gradient of the Liverpool
                    &amp; Manchester railway was fixed at 1 in 900, excepting the inclines at
                    Liverpool and at Rainhill summit, for working which special provision was made;
                    and I. K. Brunel laid out the Great Western for a long distance</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0836" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0861.jp2"/>
               <p>out of London with a ruling gradient of 1 in 1320. Other engineers, however,
                    such as Joseph Locke, cheapened the cost of construction by admitting long
                    slopes of 1 in 80 or 70. One of the steepest gradients in England on an
                    important line is the Lickey incline at Bromsgrove, on the Midland railway
                    between Birmingham and Gloucester, where the slope is 1 in 37 for two miles. The
                    maximum gradient possible depends on climatic conditions, a dry climate being
                    the most favourable. The theoretical limit is about 1 in 16; between 1 in 20 and
                    1 in 16 a steam locomotive depending on the adhesion between its wheels and the
                    rails can only haul about its own weight. In practice the gradient should not
                    exceed 1 in 22½, and even that is too steep, since theoretical conditions cannot
                    always be realized; a wet rail will reduce the adhesion, and the gradients must
                    be such that some paying load can be hauled in all weathers. When an engineer
                    has to construct a railway up a hill having a still steeper slope, he must
                    secure practicable gradients by laying out the line in ascending spirals, if
                    necessary tunnelling into the hill, as on the St Gothard railway, or in a series
                    of zigzags, or he must resort to a rack or a cable railway.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Rack Railways. —</hi> In rack railways a cog-wheel on the
                    engine engages in a toothed rack which forms part of the permanent way. The
                    earliest arrangement of this kind was patented by John Blen-kinsop, of the
                    Middleton Colliery, near Leeds, in 1811, and an engine built on his plan by
                    Mathew Murray, also of Leeds, began in 1812 to haul coals from Middleton to
                    Leeds over a line 3½ m. long. Blenkinsop placed the teeth on the outer side of
                    one of the running rails, and his reason for adopting a rack was the belief that
                    an engine with smooth wheels running on smooth rails would not have sufficient
                    'adhesion to draw the load required. It was not till more than half a century
                    later that an American, Sylvester Marsh, employed the rack system for the
                    purpose of enabling trains to surmount steep slopes on the Mount Washington
                    railway, where the maximum gradient was nearly 1 in 2½. In this case the rack
                    had pin teeth carried in a pair of angle bars. The subsequent development of
                    rack railways is especially associated with a Swiss engineer, Nicholas
                    Riggenbach, and his pupil Roman Abt, and the forms of rack introduced by them
                    are those most commonly used. That of the latter is multiple, several
                    rack-plates being placed parallel to each other, and the teeth break joint at ½,
                    ⅓ or ¼ of their pitch, according to the number of rack-plates. In this way
                    smoothness of working is ensured, the cog-wheel being constantly in action with
                    the rack. Abt also developed the plan of combining rack and adhesional working,
                    the engine working by adhesion alone on the gentler slopes but by both adhesion
                    and the rack on the steeper ones. On such lines the beginning of a rack section
                    is provided with a piece of rack mounted on springs, so that the pinions of the
                    engine engage smoothly with the teeth. Racks of this type usually become
                    impracticable for gradients steeper than 1 in 4, partly because of the excessive
                    weight of the engine required and partly because of the tendency of the
                    cog-wheel to mount the rack. The Locher rack, employed on the Mount Pilatus
                    railway, where the steepest gradient is nearly 1 in 2, is double, with vertical
                    teeth on each side, while in the Strub rack, used on the Jungfrau line, the
                    teeth are cut in the head of a rail of the ordinary Vignoles type.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Cable Railways. —</hi> For surmounting still steeper slopes,
                    cable railways may be employed. Of these there are two main systems: (1) a
                    continuous cable is carried over two main drums at each end of the line, and the
                    motion is derived cither ( <hi rend="italic">a</hi> ) from the weight of the
                    descending load or ( <hi rend="italic">b</hi> ) from a motor acting on one of
                    the main drums; (2) each end of the cable is attached to wagons, one set of
                    which accordingly ascends as the other descends. The weight required to cause
                    the downward motion is obtained either by means of the material which has to be
                    transported to the bottom of the hill or by water ballast, while to aid and
                    regulate the motion generally steam or electric motors are arranged to act on
                    the main drums, round which the cable is passed with a sufficient number of
                    turns to prevent slipping. When water ballast is employed the water is filled
                    into a tank in the bottom of the wagon or car, its quantity, if passengers are
                    carried, being regulated by the number ascending or descending.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Curves.</hi> —The curves on railways are either simple, when
                    they consist of a portion of the circumference of a single circle, or compound,
                    when they are made up of portions of the cir-cumference of two or more circles
                    of different radius. Reverse curves are compound curves in which the components
                    are of contrary flexure, like the letter S; strictly the term is only applicable
                    when the two portions follow directly one on the other, but it is sometimes used
                    of cases in which they are separated by a “ tangent ” or portion of straight
                    line. In Great Britain the curvature is defined by stating the length of the
                    radius, expressed in chains (1 chain = 66 ft. ), in America by stating the angle
                    subtended by a chord 100 ft. long; the measurements in both methods are referred
                    to the central line of the track. The radius of a ι-degree curve is 5730 ft., or
                    about 86⅔ chains, of a 15-degree curve 383 ft. or rather less than 6 chains; the
                    former is reckoned easy, the latter very sharp, at least for main lines on the
                    standard gauge. On some of the earlier English main lines no curves were
                    constructed of a less radius than a mile (80 chains), except at places where the
                    speed was likely to be low, but in later practice the radius is sometimes
                    reduced to 40 or 30 chains, even on high-speed passenger lines.</p>
               <p>When a train is running round a curve the centrifugal force which comes into
                    play tends to make its wheel-flanges press against the outer rail, or even to
                    capsize it. If this pressure is not relieved in some way, the train may be
                    derailed either (1) by “ climbing ” the outer rail, with injury to that rail
                    and, generally, to the corresponding wheel-flanges; (2) by overturning about the
                    outer rail as a hinge, possibly without injury to rails or wheels; or (3) by
                    forcing the outer rail outwards, occasionally to the extent of shearing the
                    spikes that hold it down at the curve, thus spreading or destroying the track.
                    In any case the details depend upon whether the vehicle concerned is an engine,
                    a wagon or a passenger coach, and upon whether it runs on bogie-trucks or not.
                    If it is an engine, particular attention must be directed to the type, weight,
                    arrangement of wheels and height of centre of gravity above rail level. In
                    considering the forces that produce derailment the total mass of the vehicle or
                    locomotive may be supposed to be concentrated at its centre of gravity. Two
                    lines may be drawn from this point, one to each of the two rails, in a plane
                    normal to the rails, and the ends of these lines, where they meet the rails, may
                    be joined to complete a triangle, which may conveniently be regarded as a rigid
                    frame resting on the rails. As the vehicle sweeps round the curve the centre of
                    gravity tends to be thrown outwards, like a stone from a horizontal sling. The
                    vertical pressure of the frame upon the outer rail is thus increased, while its
                    vertical pressure on the inner rail is diminished. Simultaneously the frame as a
                    whole tends to slide horizontally athwart the rails, from the inner towards the
                    outer rail, urged by the same centrifugal forces. This sliding movement is
                    resisted by placing a check rail on the inner side of the inner rail, to take
                    the lateral thrust of the wheels on that side. It is also resisted in part by
                    the conicity of the wheels, which converts the lateral force partly into a
                    vertical force, thus enabling gravity to exert a restoring influence. When the
                    lateral forces are too great to be controlled “ climbing ” occurs. Accidents due
                    to simple climbing are, however, exceedingly rare, and are usually found
                    associated with a faulty track, with “ plunging ” movements of the locomotive or
                    vehicle, or with a “ tight gauge ” at curves or points.</p>
               <p>From consideration of the rigid triangular frame described above, it is clear
                    that the “ overturning ” force acts horizontally from the centre of gravity, and
                    that the length of its lever arm is, at any instant, the vertical distance from
                    the centre of gravity to the level of the outer rail. This is true whatever be
                    the tilt of the vehicle at that instant. The restoring force exerted by gravity
                    acts in a vertical line from the centre of gravity; and the length of its lever
                    arm is the horizontal distance between this vertical line and the outer rail. If
                    therefore the outer rail is laid at a level above that of the inner rail at the
                    curve, overturning will be resisted more than would be the case if both rails
                    were in the same horizontal plane, since the tilting of the vehicle due to this
                    “ superelevation ” diminishes the overturning moment, and also increases the
                    restoring moment, by shortening in the one case and lengthening in the other the
                    lever arms at which the respective forces act. The amount of superelevation
                    required to prevent derailment at a curve can be calculated <note

               <p>is required for the successful application of definite formulae to the problem.
                    For example, what is a safe speed at a given curve for an engine, truck or coach
                    having the load equally distributed over the wheels may lead to either climbing
                    or overturning if the load is shifted to a diagonal position. An ill-balanced
                    load also exaggerates “ plunging, ” and if the period of oscillation of the load
                    happens to agree with the changes of contour or other inequalities of the track
                    vibrations of a dangerous character, giving rise to so-called “ sinuous ”
                    motion, may occur.</p>
               <p>In general it is not curvature, but change of curvature, that presents
                    difficulty in the laying-out of a line. For instance, if the curve is of S-form,
                    the point of danger is when the train enters the contra-flexure, and it is not
                    an easy matter to assign the best superelevation at all points throughout the
                    double bend. Closely allied to the question of safety is the problem of
                    preventing jolting at curves; and to obtain easy running it is necessary not
                    merely to adjust the levels of the rails in respect to one another, but to tail
                    off one curve into the next in such a manner as to avoid any approach to abrupt
                    lateral changes of direction. With increase of speeds this matter has become
                    important as an element of comfort in passenger traffic. As a first
                    approximation, the centre-line of a railway may be plotted out as a number of
                    portions of circles, with intervening straight tangents connecting them, when
                    the abruptness of the changes of direction will depend on the radii of the
                    circular portions. But if the change from straight to circular is made through
                    the medium of a suitable curve it is possible to relieve the abruptness, even on
                    curves of comparatively small radius. the smoothest and safest running is, in
                    fact, attained when a “ transition, ” “ easement ” or “ adjustment ” curve is
                    inserted between the tangent and the point of circular curvature.</p>

               <p><hi rend="italic">Gauge. —</hi> The gauge of a railway is the distance between
                    the inner edges of the two rails upon which the wheels run. The width of 4 ft.
                    8½ in. may be regarded as standard, since it prevails on probably three-quarters
                    of the railways of the globe. In North America, except for small industrial
                    railways and some short lines for local traffic, chiefly in mountainous country,
                    it has become almost universal; the long Unes of</p>
               <p>3 ft. gauge have mostly been converted, or a third rail has been laid to permit
                    interchange of vehicles, and the gauges of 5 ft. and more have disappeared. A
                    considerable number of lines still use</p>
               <p>4 ft. 9 in., but as their rolling stock runs freely on the 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge
                    and vice versa, this does not constitute a break of gauge for traffic purposes.
                    The commercial importance of such free interchange of traffic is the controlling
                    factor in determining the gauge of any new railway that is not isolated by its
                    geographical position. In Great Britain railways are built to gauges other than
                    4 ft. 8½ in. only under exceptional conditions; the old “ broad gauge ” of 7 ft.
                    which I. K. Brunel adopted for the Great Western railway disappeared on the 20th <hi rend="sup">-</hi> 23rd of May 1892, when the main line from London to
                    Penzance was converted to standard gauge throughout its length. In Ireland the
                    usual gauge is 5 ft. 3 in., but there are also lines laid to a</p>
               <p>3 ft. gauge. On the continent of Europe the standard gauge is generally adopted,
                    though in France there are many miles of</p>
               <p>4 ft. 9 in. gauge; the normal Spanish and Portuguese gauge is, however, 5 ft. 5¾
                    in., and that of Russia 5 ft. In France and other European countries there is
                    also an important mileage of metre gauge, and even narrower, on lines of local
                    or secondary importance. In India the prevailing gauge is 5 ft. 6 in., but there
                    is a large mileage of other gauges, especially metre. In the British colonies
                    the prevailing gauge is 3 ft. 6 in., as in South Africa, Queensland, Tasmania
                    and New Zealand; but in New South Wales the normal is 4 ft. 8½ in. and in
                    Victoria</p>
               <p>5 ft. 3 in., communication between different countries of the</p>
               <p>Australian Commonwealth being thus carried on under the disadvantage of break of
                    gauge. Though the standard gauge is in use in Lower Egypt, the line into the
                    Egyptian Sudan was built on a gauge of 3 ft. 6. in., so that if the so-called
                    Cape to Cairo railway is ever completed, there will be one gauge from Upper
                    Egypt to Cape Town. In South America the 5 ft. 6 in. gauge is in use, with
                    various others.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Mono-Rail Systems. —</hi> The gauge may be regarded as
                    reduced to its narrowest possible dimensions in mono-rail lines, where the
                    weight of the trains is carried on a single rail. This method of construction,
                    however, has been* adopted only to a very limited extent. In the Lartigue system
                    the train is straddled over a single central rail, elevated a suitable distance
                    above the ground. A short line of this kind runs from Ballybunnion to Listowel
                    in Ireland, and a more ambitious project on the same principle, on the plans of
                    Mr F. B. Behr, to connect Liverpool and Manchester, was sanctioned by Parliament
                    in 1901. In this case electricity was to be the motive-power, and speeds
                    exceeding 100 m. an hour were to be attained, but the line has not been built.
                    In the Langen mono-rail the cars are hung from a single overhead rail; a line on
                    this system works between Barmen and Elberfeld, about 9 m., the cars for a
                    portion of the distance being suspended over the river Wupper. In the system
                    devised by Mr Louis Brennan the cars run on a single rail laid on the ground,
                    their stability being maintained by a heavy gyrostat revolving at great speed in
                    a vacuum.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Permanent Way. —</hi> When the earth-works of a line have
                    been completed and the tops of the embankments and the bottoms of the cuttings
                    brought to the level decided upon, the next step is to lay the permanent way,
                    so-called probably in distinction to the temporary way used during construction.
                    The first step is to deposit a layer of ballast on the road-bed or “ formation,
                    ” which often slopes away slightly on each side from the central fine to
                    facilitate drainage. The ballast consists of such materials as broken stone,
                    furnace slag, gravel, cinders or earth, the lower layers commonly consisting of
                    coarser materials than the top ones, and its purpose is to provide a firm,
                    well-drained foundation in which the sleepers or cross-ties may be embedded and
                    held in place, and by which the weight of the track and the trains may be
                    distributed over the road-bed. Its depth varies, according to the traffic which
                    the line has to bear, from about 6 in. to 1 ft. or rather more under the
                    sleepers, and the materials of the surface layers are often chosen so as to be
                    more or less dustless. Its width depends on the numbers of tracks and their
                    gauge; for a double line of standard gauge it is about 25 ft., a space of 6 ft.
                    (“ six-foot way ”) being left between the inner rails of each pair in Great
                    Britain (fig. 8), and a rather larger distance in America</p>
               <p>(fig. 9) <hi rend="sub">j</hi> where the over-hang of the rolling stock is
                    greater. The intervals between the sleepers are filled in level with ballast,</p>
               <p>which less commonly is also heaped up over them, especially at the projecting
                    ends.</p>

               <p>Sleepers, called ties or cross-ties in America, are the blocks or slabs on which
                    the rails are carried. They are nearly always placed transversely, across the
                    direction of the lines, the longi-tudinal position such as was adopted in
                    connexion with the broad gauge on the Great Western in England having been
                    abandoned except in special cases. Stone blocks were tried as sleepers in the
                    early days of railways, but they proved too rigid, and besides, it was found
                    difficult to keep the line true with them. Wood is the material most widely
                    used, but steel is employed in some countries where timber is scarce or liable
                    to destruction by white ants, though it is still regarded as too expensive in
                    comparison with wood for general adoption. Steel sleepers were used
                    experimentally on the London &amp; North-Western, but were abandoned owing
                    to the shortness of their life. In Germany, where they have met with greater
                    favour, there were over 26½ millions in use in 1905, <note anchored="true"

                        Eisenhüttenleute on Dec. 8, 1907, translated in the <hi rend="italic">Railway Gazette</hi> (London) on April 3, 10 and 17, 1908. </note> and
                    they have been tried by some American railways. Numerous forms of ferro-concrete
                    sleepers have also been devised.</p>
               <p>In Great Britain, Germany and France, at least 90% of the wooden sleepers are “
                    treated ” before they are laid, to increase their resistance to decay, and the
                    same practice is followed to some extent in other European countries. A great
                    number of preservative processes have been devised. In that most largely used,
                    known as “ creosoting, ” dead oil of tar, to the amount of some 3 gallons per
                    sleeper, is forced into the wood under pressure, or is sucked in by vacuum, both
                    the timber and the oil being heated. In the United States only a small
                    percentage of the ties are treated in any way beyond seasoning in the open air,
                    timber, in the opinion of the railway officials, being still too cheap in nearly
                    all parts of that country to justify the use of preservatives. Some railway
                    companies, however, having a long mileage in timberless regions, do “ treat ”
                    their sleepers.</p>
               <p>Typical dimensions for sleepers on important British railways are: —length 9
                    ft., breadth 10 in., and depth 5 in. In America 8 ft. is the most common length,
                    the breadth being 8 in., and the depth 6 or 7 in.</p>
               <p>There are two main ways of attaching the rails to the sleepêrs, corresponding to
                    two main types of rails—the bull-headed rail and the Vignoles or flange rail. In
                    the first method, which is practically universal in Great Britain and is also
                    employed to</p>
               <p>some extent in France and India, the rails have rounded bases and are supported
                    by being wedged, with wooden keys, in cast-iron chairs which are bolted to the
                    sleepers. In the second method the rails have flat flanged bases which rest
                    directly on the sleepers (fig. 10). The chairs on the British system weigh about
                    45 or 50 lb each on important lines, though they may be less where the traffic
                    is light, and are fixed to the sleepers each by two, three or four fastenings,
                    either screw spikes, or round drift bolts entered in holes previously bored, or
                    fang bolts or wooden trenails. Sometimes a strip of felt is interposed between
                    the chair and the sleeper, and sometimes a serrated surface is prepared on the
                    sleeper for the chair which is forced into its seat by hydraulic pressure. The
                    keys which hold the rail in the chairs are usually of oak and are placed outside
                    the rails; the inside position has also been employed, but has the disadvantage
                    of detracting from the elasticity of the road since the weight of a passing
                    train presses the rails up against a rigid mass of metal instead of against a
                    slightly yielding block of wood. The rails, which for heavy main line traffic
                    may weigh as much as 100 ℔ per yard, or even more, are rolled in lengths of from
                    30 to 60 ft., and sleepers are placed under them at intervals of between 2 and 3
                    ft. (centre to centre), 11 sleepers to a 30 ft. rail being a common arrangement.
                    On the London &amp; North-Western railway there are 24 sleepers to each 60
                    ft. rail. A small space is left between the end of one rail and that of the
                    next, in order to allow for expansion in hot weather, and at the joint the two
                    are firmly braced together by a pair of fish-plates (fig. 11). These are flat
                    bars of iron or steel from 18 in. to 2 ft.</p>

               <p>rail, one on each side, and secured with four</p>
               <p>bolts passing through the web; sometimes, to</p>
               <p>give additional stiffness, they extend down</p>
               <p>below the lower table of the rail and are bent</p>
               <p>round so as to clip it. Occasionally the joints</p>
               <p>thus formed are “ supported ” on a sleeper,</p>
               <p>as was the practice in the early days of rail</p>
               <p>way construction, But they are generally</p>
               <p>“ suspended ” between two sleepers, which are</p>
               <p>set rather more closely together than at other points in the rail. Preferably,
                    they are so arranged that those in both lines of rails come opposite each other
                    and are placed between the same pair of sleepers.</p>
               <p>Flat-bottomed rails are fastened to the sleepers by hook-headed spikes, the
                    heads of which project over the flanges. In the United States the spikes are
                    simply driven in with a maul, and the rails stand upright, little care being
                    taken to prepare seats for them on the sleepers, on which they soon seat
                    them-selves. The whole arrangement is simple and cheap in first cost, and it
                    lends itself admirably to fast track-laying and to repairs and changes of line.
                    On the continent of Europe the practice is common of notching the sleeper so as
                    to give the rail a slight cant inwards—a result obtained in England by canting
                    the rail in the chairs—and metal plates or strips of felt are put under the
                    rail, which is carefully fastened to the sleeper by screwed spikes (fig. 12).
                    This method of construction is more</p>
               <p>expensive than the American in first cost, but it gives a more durable and
                    stable track. Such metal plates, or “ tie-plates, ” have come into considerable
                    use also in the United States, where they are always made of rolled steel,
                    punched with rectangular holes through which the spikes pass. They serve two
                    principal</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0839" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0864.jp2"/>
               <p>purposes: they diminish the wear of the sleeper under the rail by providing a
                    larger bearing surface, and they help to support the spikes and so to keep the
                    gauge. On all the accepted forms there are two or more flanges at the bottom,
                    running lengthwise of the plate and crosswise of the rail; these are requisite
                    to give proper stiffness, and further, as they are forced into the tie by the
                    weight of passing traffic, they help to fix the plate securely in place. The
                    joints of flanged rails are similar to those employed with bull-headed rails.
                    Various forms, mostly patented, have been tried in the United States, but the
                    one most generally adopted consists of two symmetrical angle bars (fig. 13),
                    varying in length (from 20 to 48 in. ), in weight and in the number of bolts,
                    which may be four</p>
               <p>or six.</p>
               <p>The substitution of steel for iron as the material for rails which made possible
                    the axle loads and the speeds of to-day, and, by reducing the cost of
                    maintenance, contributed enormously to the economic efficiency of railways, was
                    one of the most important events in the history of railways, and a scarcely less
                    important element of progressive economy has been the continued improvement of
                    the steel rail in stiffness of section and in toughness and hardness of
                    material. Carbon is the important element in controlling hardness, and the
                    amount present is in general higher in the United States than in Great Britain.
                    The specifications for bull-headed rails issued by the British Engineering
                    Standards Committee in 1904 provided for a carbon-content ranging from 0∙35 to
                    0∙50%, with a phosphorus maximum of 0∙075%. In the United States a committee of
                    the American Society of Civil Engineers, appointed to consider the question of
                    rail manufacture in consequence of an increase in the number of rail-failures,
                    issued an interim report in 1907 in which it suggested a range of carbon from
                    0∙55 to 0∙65%for the heaviest sections of Bessemer steel flange rails, with a
                    phosphorus maximum of 0·085%; while the specifications of the American Society
                    for Testing Materials, current at the same period, put the carbon limits at 0∙45
                    to 0∙55%, and the phosphorus limit at 0·10. For rails of basic open-hearth
                    steel, which is rapidly ousting Bessemer steel, the Civil Engineers’
                    specifications allowed from 0∙65 to 0∙75% of carbon with 0·05% of phosphorus,
                    while the specifications of the American Railway Engineering and Maintenance of
                    Way Association provided for a range of 0∙75 to 0∙85% of carbon, with a maximum
                    of 0∙03% of phosphorus. The rail-failures mentioned above also drew renewed
                    attention to the importance of the thermal treatment of the steel from the time
                    of melting to the last passage through the rolling mill and to the necessity of
                    the finishing temperature being sufficiently low if the product is to be fine
                    grained, homogeneous and tough; and to permit of this requirement being met
                    there was a tendency to increase the thickness of the metal in the web and
                    flanges of the rails. The standard specification adopted by the Pennsylvania
                    railway in 1908 provided that in rails weighing 100 ℔ to the yard 41 % of the
                    metal should be in the head, 18∙6% in the web, and 40∙4% in the base, while for
                    85 lb rails 42∙2% was to be in the head, 17∙8% in the web and 40·0% in the base.
                    These rails were to be rolled in 33-ft. lengths. According to the specification
                    for 85 lb rails adopted by the Canadian Pacific railway about the same time,
                    36∙77% of the metal was to be in the head, 22·21 % in the web and 41·02%</p>

                    rails come together, the two inner ones (one of the main line and the other of
                    the siding), known as “ switch rails ” ( <hi rend="italic">b</hi> , fig. 14),
                    are tapered to a fine point or tongue, and rigidly connected together at such a

               <p>In Great Britain the Board</p>
               <p>of Trade requires facing</p>
               <p>points to be avoided as</p>
               <p>far as possible; but, of</p>
               <p>course, they are a neces</p>
               <p>sity at junctions where</p>
               <p>running lines diverge and</p>
               <p>at the crossing places</p>
               <p>which must be provided</p>
               <p>to enable trains to pass</p>
               <p>each other on single-track</p>
               <p>lines. At stations the</p>
               <p>points that give access</p>
               <p>to sidings are generally</p>
               <p>arranged as trailing points</p>
               <p>with respect to the direc</p>
               <p>tion of traffic on the main</p>
               <p>lines; that is, trains can</p>
               <p>not pass direct into sidings,</p>
               <p>but have to stop and then run backwards into them. In shunting yards the points
                    are commonly set in the required direction by means of hand levers placed close
                    beside the lines, but those at junctions and those which give access from the
                    main lines to sidings at wayside stations are worked by a system of rods from
                    the signal cabin, or by electric or pneumatic power controlled from it and
                    interlocked with the signals (see Signal: § <hi rend="italic">Railway).</hi> Crossings are inevitable adjuncts of points. Where a branch diverges from a main
                    line, one rail of the one must cross one rail of the other, and a V-crossing is
                    formed (V). Where, as at a double-line junction, one pair of rails crosses
                    another pair, “ diamond ” crossings (D) are formed. At both types of crossing,
                    check rails (c) must be provided to guide the wheel-flanges, and if these are
                    not accurately placed the safety of the trains will be endangered. At
                    double-line junctions trains passing over the diamond crossings evidently block
                    traffic going in the opposite direction to that in which they are travelling. To
                    avoid the delay thus caused the branch line which would occasion the diamond
                    crossing if it were taken across on the level is sometimes carried over the main
                    line by an over-bridge (“ flying junction ”) or under it by an under-bridge (“
                    burrowing junction”).</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Railway Stations. —</hi> Railway stations are either “
                    terminal ” or “ intermediate. ” A terminal station embraces (1) the passenger
                    station; (2) the goods station; (3) the locomotive, carriage and waggon depots,
                    where the engines and the carrying stock are kept, cleaned, examined and
                    repaired. At many intermediate stations the same arrangements, on a smaller
                    scale, are made; in all of them there is at least accommodation for the
                    passenger and the goods traffic. The stations for</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0840" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0865.jp2"/>
               <p>passengers and goods are generally in different and sometimes in, distant
                    positions, the place selected for each being that which is most convenient for
                    the traffic. The passenger station abuts on the main line, or, at termini, forms
                    the natural terminus, at a place as near as can conveniently be obtained to the
                    centre of the population which constitutes the passenger traffic; and preferably
                    its platforms should be at or near the ground level, for convenience of access.
                    The goods station is approached by a siding or fork set off from the main line
                    at a point short of the passenger station. In order to keep down the expense of
                    shunting the empty trains and engines to and from the platforms the carriage and
                    locomotive depots should be as near the passenger station as possible; but often
                    the price of land renders it impracticable to locate them in the immediate
                    vicinity and they are to be found at a distance of several miles.</p>
               <p>In laying out the approaches and station yard of a passenger station ample width
                    and space should be provided, with well-defined means of ingress and egress to
                    facilitate the circulation of vehicles and with a long setting-down pavement to
                    enable them to discharge their passengers and luggage without delay. The
                    position of the main buildings —ticket offices, waiting and refreshment-rooms,
                    parcels offices, &amp;c. —relative to the direction of the lines of rails
                    may be used as a means of classifying terminal stations. They are placed either
                    on the departure side parallel to the platform (“ side ” stations) or at right
                    angles to the rails and platforms (“ end ” stations). Many large stations,
                    however, are of a mixed type, and the offices are arranged in a fork between two
                    or more series of platforms, or partly at the end and partly on one side. Where
                    heavy suburban traffic has to be dealt with, the ex-pedient is occasionally
                    adopted of taking some of the lines round the end in a continuous loop, so that
                    incoming trains can deposit their passengers at an underground platform and
                    immediately proceed on their outward journey. Intermediate stations, like
                    terminal ones, sheuld be convenient in situation and easy of approach, and,
                    especially if they are important, should be on the ground level rather than on
                    an embankment or in a cutting. The lines through them should be, if possible,
                    straight and on the level; the British Board of Trade forbids them being placed
                    on a gradient steeper than 1 in 260, unless it is unavoidable. Intermediate
                    stations at the surface level are naturally constructed as side stations, and
                    whether offices are provided on both sides or whether they are mainly
                    concentrated on one will depend on local circumstances, the amount of the
                    traffic, and the direction in which it preponderates. When the railway lies
                    below the surface level the bulk of the offices are often placed on a bridge
                    spanning the lines, access being given to the platforms by staircases or lifts,
                    and similarly when the railway is at a high level the offices may be arranged
                    under the lines. Occasionally on a double-track railway one platform placed
                    between the tracks serves both of them; this “island” arrangement, as it is
                    termed, has the advantage that more tracks can be readily added without
                    disturbance of existing buildings, but when it is adopted the exit from the
                    trains is at the opposite side to that which is usual, and accidents have
                    happened through passengers alighting at the usual side without noticing the
                    absence of a platform. At stations on double-track railways which have a heavy
                    traffic four tracks are sometimes provided, the two outside ones only having
                    platforms, so that fast trains get a clear road and can pass slow ones that are
                    standing in the station. In Great Britain, it may be noted, trains almost
                    invariably keep to the left, whereas in most other countries</p>
               <p>right-handed running is the rule.</p>
               <p>The arrangement and appropriation of the tracks in a station materially affect
                    the economical and efficient working of the traffic. There must be a sufficient
                    provision of sidings, connected with the running tracks by points, for holding
                    spare rolling stock and to enable carriages to be added to or taken off trains
                    and engines to be changed with as little delay as possible. At terminal
                    stations, especially at such as are used by short-distance trains which arrive
                    at and start from the same platform, a third track is often laid between a pair
                    of platform tracks, so that the engine of a train which has arrived at the
                    platform can pass out and place itself at the other end of the train, which
                    remains undisturbed. At the new Victoria station (London) of the London,
                    Brighton &amp; South Coast railway—which is so long that two trains can
                    stand end to end at the platforms—this system is extended so as to permit a
                    train to start out from the inner end of a platform even though another train is
                    occupying the outer end. One of the advantages of electric trains on the
                    multiple control system is that they economize terminal accommodation, because
                    they can be driven from either end indifferently, and therefore avoid the
                    necessity for tracks by which engines can change from one end of the train to
                    the other.</p>
               <p>The platforms on British railways have a standard elevation of 3 ft. above rail
                    level, and they are not now made less than 2½ ft. in height. In other countries
                    they are generally lower; in the United States they are commonly level with, or
                    only a few inches higher than, the top of the rails. They may consist of earth
                    with a retaining wall along the tracks and with the surface gravelled or paved
                    with stone or asphalt, or they may be constructed entirely of timber, or they
                    may be formed of stone slabs supported on longitudinal walls. They should he of
                    ample dimensions to accommodate the traffic—the British Board of Trade requires
                    them to be not less than 6 ft. wide at small stations and not less than 12 ft.
                    wide at large ones—and they should be as free as possible from obstructions,
                    such as pillars supporting the roof. At intermediate stations the roofs are
                    often carried on brackets fixed to the walls of the station buildings, and
                    project only to the edge of the platforms. At larger stations where both the
                    platforms and the tracks arc covered in, there are two broad types of
                    construction, with many intermediate variations: the roof may either be
                    comparatively low, of the “ ridge and furrow ” pattern, borne on a number of
                    rows of pillars, or it may consist of a single lofty span extending clear across
                    the area from the side walls. The advantage claimed for roofs formed with one or
                    two large spans is that they permit the platforms and tracks to be readily
                    rearranged at any time as required, whereas this is difficult with the other
                    type, especially since the British Board of Trade requires the pillars to be not
                    less than 6 ft. away from the edges of the platforms. On the other hand, wide
                    spans are more expensive both in first cost and in maintenance, and there is the
                    possibility of a failure such as caused the collapse in December 1905 of the
                    roof of Charing Cross (S. E. R. ) station, London, which then consisted of a
                    single span. Whatever the pattern adopted for the roof, a sufficient portion of
                    it must be glazed to admit light, and it should be so designed that the ironwork
                    can be easily inspected and painted and the glass readily cleaned. For the
                    illumination of large stations by night electric arc lamps are frequently
                    employed, but some authorities favour high-pressure incandescent gas-lighting.</p>
               <p>At busy stations separate tracks are sometimes appropriated to the use of height
                    engines and empty trains, on which they may be run between the platforms and the
                    locomotive and carriage depots. A carriage depot includes sheds in which the
                    vehicles are stored, arrangements for washing and cleaning them, and sidings on
                    which they are marshalled into trains. At a locomotive depot the chief building
                    is the “ running shed ” in which the engines are housed and cleaned. This may be
                    rectangular in shape (“ straight ” shed), containing a series of parallel tracks
                    on which the engines stand and which are reached by means of points and
                    crossings diverging from a main track outside; or it may take a polygonal or
                    circular form (round house or rotunda), the lines for the engines radiating from
                    a turn-table which occupies the centre and can be rotated so as to serve any of
                    the radiating lines. The second arrangement enables any particular engine to
                    enter or leave without disturbing the other; but on the other hand an accident
                    to the turn-table may temporarily imprison the whole of them. In both types pits
                    are constructed between the rails</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0841" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0866.jp2"/>
               <p>on which the engines stand to afford easy access for the inspection and cleaning
                    of their mechanism. Machine shops are usually provided to enable minor repairs
                    to be executed; the tendency, both in England and America, is to increase the
                    amount of such repairing plant at engine sheds, thus lengthening the intervals
                    between the visits of the engines to the main repairing shops of the railway. A
                    locomotive depot further includes stores of the various materials required in
                    working the engines, coal stages at which they are loaded with coal, and an
                    ample supply of water. The quality of the last is a matter of great importance;
                    when it is unsuitable, the boilers will suffer, and the installation of a
                    water-softening plant may save more in the expenses of boiler maintenance than
                    it costs to operate. The water cranes or towers which are placed at intervals
                    along the railway to supply the engines with water require similar care in
                    regard to the quality of the water laid on to them, as also to the water
                    troughs, or track tanks as they are called in America, by which engines are able
                    to pick up water without stopping. These consist of shallow troughs about 18 in.
                    wide, placed between the rails on perfectly level stretches of line. When water
                    is required, a scoop is lowered into them from below the engine, and if the
                    speed is sufficient the water is forced up it into the tender-tanks. Such
                    troughs were first employed on the London &amp; North-Western railway in
                    1857 by John Ramsbottom, and have since been adopted on many other lines.</p>
               <p>Goods stations vary in size from those which consist of perhaps a single siding,
                    to those which have accommodation for thousands of wagons. At a small roadside
                    station, where the traffic is of a purely local character, there will be some
                    sidings to which horses and carts have access for handling bulk goods like coal,
                    gravel, manure, &amp;c., and a covered shed for loading and unloading
                    packages and materials which it is undesirable to expose to the weather. The
                    shed may have a single pair of rails for wagons running through it along one
                    side of a raised platform, there being a roadway for carts on the other side; or
                    if more accommodation is required there may be two tracks, one on each side of
                    the platform, which is then approached by carts at the end. In either case the
                    platform is fitted with a crane or cranes for lifting merchandise into and out
                    of the wagons, and doors enable the shed to be used as a lock-up warehouse. In a
                    large station the arrangements become much more complicated, the precise design
                    being governed by the nature of the traffic that has to be served and by the
                    physical configuration of the site. It is generally convenient to keep the
                    inwards and the outwards traffic distinct and to deal with the two classes
                    separately; at junction stations it may also be necessary to provide for the
                    transfer of freight from one wagon to another, though the bulk of goods traffic
                    is conveyed through to its destination in the wagons into which it was
                    originally loaded. The increased loading space required in the sheds is obtained
                    by multiplying the number and the length of lines and platforms; sometimes also
                    there are short sidings, cut into the platforms at right angles to the lines, in
                    which wagons are placed by the aid of wagon turn-tables, and sometimes the
                    wagons are dealt with on two floors, being raised or lowered bodily from the
                    ground level by lifts. The higher floors commonly form warehouses where traders
                    may store goods which have arrived or are awaiting despatch. An elaborate
                    organization is required to keep a complete check and record of all the goods
                    entering and leaving the station, to ensure that they are loaded into the proper
                    wagons according to their destination, that they are unloaded and sorted in such
                    a way that they can be delivered to their consignees with the least possible
                    delay, that they are not stolen or accidentally mislaid, &amp;c.; and
                    accommodation must be provided for a large. clerical and supervisory staff to
                    attend to these matters. British rail-ways also undertake the collection and
                    delivery of freight, in addition to transporting it, and thus an extensive range
                    of vans and wagons, whether drawn by horses or mechanically propelled, must be
                    provided in connexion with an important</p>
               <p>station.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Shunting Yards, —</hi> It may happen that from a large
                    station sufficient traffic may be consigned to certain other large stations to
                    enable full train-loads to be made up daily, or several times a day, and
                    despatched direct to their destinations. In general, however, the conditions are
                    less simple. Though a busy colliery may send off its product by the train-load
                    to an important town, the wagons will usually be addressed to a number of
                    different consignees at different depots in different parts of the town, and
                    therefore the train will have to be broken up somewhere short of its destination
                    and its trucks rearranged, together with those of other trains similarly
                    constituted, into fresh trains for conveyance to the various depots. Again, a
                    station of moderate size may collect goods destined for a great variety of
                    places but not in sufficient quantities to compose a full train-load for any of
                    them, and then it becomes impossible, except at the cost of uneconomical
                    working, to avoid despatching trains which contain wagons intended for many
                    diverse destinations . For some distance these wagons will all travel over the
                    same line, but sooner or later they will reach a junction-point where their ways
                    will diverge and where they must be separated. At this point trains of wagons
                    similarly destined for different places will be arriving from other lines, and
                    hence the necessity will arise of collecting together from all the trains all
                    the wagons which are travelling to the same place.</p>
               <p>The problem may be illustrated diagrammatically as follows (fig. 15): A may be
                    supposed to be a junction outside a large seaport where branches from docks <hi
                        rend="italic"> a</hi> , <hi rend="italic">b, c</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        > d</hi> converge, and where the main line also divides into three, going
                    to B, C and D respectively. A train from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> will contain
                    some wagons for B, some for C and some for D, as will also the trains from <hi
                        rend="italic"> a</hi> , <hi rend="italic">b, c</hi> and <hi rend="italic"
                        > d.</hi> At A therefore it becomes necessary to disentangle and group
                    together all the wagons that are intended for B, all that are intended for C,
                    and all that are intended for D. Even that is not the whole of the problem.
                    Between A and B, A and C, and A and D, there may be a string of stations, <hi
                        rend="italic"> p, q, r, s,</hi> &amp;c., all receiving goods from <hi
                        rend="italic"> a, b, c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d,</hi> and it would
                    manifestly be inconvenient and wasteful of time and trouble if the trains
                    serving those intermediate stations were made up with, say, six wagons from <hi
                        rend="italic"> a</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p</hi> next the engine, five
                    from <hi rend="italic">b</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p</hi> at the middle, and
                    four from <hi rend="italic">C</hi> to <hi rend="italic">p</hi> near the end.
                    Hence at A the trucks from <hi rend="italic">a</hi> , <hi rend="italic">b</hi> , <hi rend="italic">c</hi> and <hi rend="italic">d</hi> must not only
                    be <hi rend="italic">sorted</hi> according as they have to travel along A B, A
                    C, or A D, but also must be <hi rend="italic">marshalled</hi> into trains in
                    the order of the stations along those lines. Conversely, trains. arriving at A
                    from B, C and D must be broken up and remade in order to distribute their wagons
                    to the different dock branches.</p>
               <p>To enable the wagons to be shunted into the desired order yards containing a
                    large number of sidings are constructed at important junction points like A.
                    Such a yard consists essentially of a group or groups of sidings, equal in
                    length at least to the longest train run on the line, branching out from a
                    single main track and often again converging to a single track at the other end;
                    the precise design, however, varies with the amount and character of the work
                    that has to be done, with the configuration of the ground, and also with the
                    mode of shunting adopted. The oldest and commonest method of shunting is that
                    known as “ push-and-pull, ” or in America as “ link-and-pin ” or “ tail ”
                    shunting. An engine coupled to a batch of wagons runs one or more of them down
                    one siding, leaves them there, then returns back with the remainder clear of the
                    points where the sidings diverge, runs one or more others down another siding,
                    and so on till they are all disposed of. The same operation is repeated with
                    fresh batches of wagons, until the sidings contain a number of trains, each
                    intended, it may be supposed, for a particular town or district. In some cases
                    nothing more is required than to attach an engine and brake-van (“ caboose ”)
                    and despatch the train; but if, as will happen in others, a further
                    rearrangement of</p>

               <p>the wagons is necessary to get them into station order this is effected on the
                    same principle.</p>
               <p>Push-and-pull shunting is simple, but it is also slow, and therefore efforts
                    have been made at busy yards where great numbers of trains are dealt with to
                    introduce more expeditious methods. One of these, employed in America, is known
                    as “poling. ” Alongside the tracks on which stand the trains that are to be
                    broken up and from which the sidings diverge subsidiary tracks are provided for
                    the use of the shunting engines. These engines have a pole projecting
                    horizontally in front of them, or are attached to a “ pole-car ” having such a
                    pole. The method of working is for the pole to be swung out behind a number of
                    wagons; one engine is then started and with its pole pushes the wagons in front
                    of it until their speed is sufficient to carry them over the points, where they
                    are diverted into any desired siding. It then runs back to the train to repeat
                    the operation, but while it is doing so a second engine similarly equipped has
                    poled away a batch of wagons on the opposite side. In this way a train is
                    distributed with great rapidity, especi-ally if the points giving access to the
                    different sidings are worked by power so that they can be quickly manipulated.</p>
               <p>Another method, which was introduced into America from Europe about 1890, is
                    that of the summit or “ hump. ” The wagons are pushed by an engine at their rear
                    up one slope of an artificial mound, and as they run down the other slope by
                    gravity are switched into the desired siding. Sometimes a site can be found for
                    the sorting sidings where the natural slope of the ground is sufficiently steep
                    to make the wagons run down of themselves. One of the earliest and best known of
                    such “ gravity ” yards is that at Edgehill, near Liverpool, on the London
                    &amp; North-Western railway, which was established in 1873. Here, at the
                    highest level, there are a number of “ upper reception lines ” converging to a
                    single line which leads to a group of “ sorting sidings ” at a lower level.
                    These in turn converge to a pair of single lines which lead <hi rend="italic">to</hi> two groups of marshalling sidings, called “ gridirons ” from their
                    shape, and these again converge to single lines leading to “ lower reception and
                    departure lines” at the bottom of the slope. The wagons from the upper reception
                    lines are sorted into trains on the sorting sidings, and then, in the gridirons,
                    are arranged in the appropriate order and marshalled ready to be sent off from
                    the departure lines. (H. M. R. )</p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Locomotive Power</hi></p>
               <p>The term “ power ” is used in technical sense to mean the rate at which work is
                    done against a resistance, and is measured in units of energy expended per unit
                    of time. The unit of power commonly used by engineers is the horse-power, and
                    this unit corresponds to a rate of working of 550 foot-℔ of work per second. The
                    problems arising out of the special consideration of the power required to
                    propel a railway train against the resistances opposing its motion, the way the
                    power is applied to trains, the agent by means of which the power is exerted,
                    are conveniently grouped together under the general heading of Locomotive Power.
                    There are certain fundamental relations common to all tractive problems, and
                    these are briefly considered in §§ 1 and 2, after which the article refers
                    particularly to steam locomotives, although §§4, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 10 have a
                    general application to all modes of traction.</p>
               <p>§ I. <hi rend="italic">Fundamental Relations. —</hi> The resistance against
                    which a train is moved along a railway is overcome by means of energy obtained
                    from the combustion of fuel, or in some few cases by energy obtained from a
                    waterfall. If the total resist-ance against which the train is maintained in
                    motion with an instantaneous velocity of V feet per second is R, the rate at
                    which energy is expended in moving the train is represented by the product RV,
                    and this must be the rate at which energy is supplied to the train after
                    deducting all losses due to transmission from the source of power. Thus if R is
                    equal to 10, 000 ℔ when the velocity is 44 ft. per second, equivalent to 30 m.
                    per hour, the rate of working against the resistance is 440, 000 foot-℔ per
                    second.</p>
               <p>In whatever form energy is produced and distributed to the train it ultimately
                    appears as mechanical energy applied to turn one or more axles against the
                    resistance to their rotation imposed by the weight on the wheels and the motion
                    of the train.</p>
               <p>The rate at which work is done on a particular axle is measured by the product
                    Tω, where T is the torque or turning moment exerted on the axle by the motor or
                    mechanism applied to it for this purpose, and <hi rend="italic">ω</hi> is the
                    angular velocity of the axle in radians per second. Hence if all the energy
                    supplied to the train is utilized at one axle there is the fundamental relation</p>
               <p>Tω = RV (1)</p>
               <p>Continuing the above arithmetical illustration, if the wheels to the axle of
                    which the torque is applied are 4 ft. diameter, <hi rend="italic">ω =</hi> 44/2 =22 radians per second, and therefore T = 440, 000/22 = 20, 000 ℔ ft. If
                    the energy supplied is distributed between several axles the relation becomes</p>

               <p>where T <hi rend="sub">1</hi> , T <hi rend="sub">2</hi> , T <hi rend="sub">3</hi> , &amp;c. are the torques on the axles whose respective angular

               <p>The fundamental condition governing the design of all tractive machinery is that
                    the wheels belonging to the axles to which torque is applied shall roll along
                    the rails without slipping, and exert a tractive force on the train.</p>
               <p>The fundamental relation between the applied torque and the tractive force F
                    will be understood from fig. 16, which shows in a diagrammatic form a wheel and</p>
               <p>axle connected to the framework</p>
               <p>of a vehicle, in the way adopted</p>
               <p>for railway trains. The journal</p>
               <p>of the axle A, is carried in a bear-</p>
               <p>ing or axle-box B, which is free</p>
               <p>to move vertically in the wide</p>
               <p>vertical slot G, formed in the frame</p>
               <p>and called generally “ the horns; ”</p>
               <p>under the control of the spring.</p>
               <p>The weight W <hi rend="sub">1</hi> carried by the part</p>
               <p>of the frame supported by the</p>
               <p>wheel (whose diameter is D) is</p>
               <p>transmitted first to the pins P <hi rend="sub">1</hi> , P <hi rend="sub">2</hi> ,</p>
               <p>which are fixed to the frame, and</p>
               <p>then to the spring links L <hi rend="sub">1</hi> , L <hi rend="sub">2</hi> ,</p>
               <p>which are jointed at their respective ends to the spring S, the centre of which
                    rests on the axle-box.</p>
               <p>Let a couple be applied to the axle tending to turn it in the direction shown by
                    the arrow. This couple, we may assume, will be equally divided between the two
                    wheels, so that the torque acting on each will be ½T. Assuming the wheels to
                    roll along the rail without slipping, this couple will be equivalent to the
                    couple formed by the equal opposite and parallel forces, F <hi rend="sub">1</hi> acting in the direction shown, from the axle-box on to the frame, and F <hi rend="sub">1</hi> = <hi rend="italic">μ0</hi> , acting along the
                    rail. The torque corresponding to this couple is F <hi rend="sub">1</hi> × ½D
                    = ½μW <hi rend="sub">1</hi> D,and hence follows the fundamental relation, ½T =
                    ½F <hi rend="sub">1</hi> D = ½μW <hi rend="sub">1</hi> D, or if W now
                    represents the weight supported by the axle, F will be the tractive force
                    exerted on the frame by the two axle-boxes to propel the vehicle, and the more
                    convenient relation is established,</p>
               <p>T = ½FD = ½μWD (3)</p>
               <p>If T has a greater value than this relation justifies the wheels will slip. F is
                    called the “ tractive force ” at the rail. The coefficient of friction µ is a
                    variable quantity depending upon the state of the rails, but is usually taken to
                    be ⅙. This is the fundamental equation between the forces acting, however the
                    torque may be applied. Multiplying through by ω we obtain</p>
               <p>Tω = ½FωD = ½μWωD = RV (4)</p>
               <p>This is a fundamental energy equation for any form of locomotive in which there
                    is only one driving-axle.</p>
               <p>The couple T is necessarily accompanied by an equal and opposite couple acting
                    on the frame, which couple endeavours to turn the frame in the opposite
                    direction to that in which the axle rotates. The practical effect of this
                    opposite couple is slightly to tilt the frame and thus to redistribute slightly
                    the weights on the wheels carrying the vehicle.</p>
               <p>If there are several driving-axles in a train, the product Tω must be estimated
                    for each separately; then the sum of the products will be equal to RV. In
                    equation (4) there is a fixed relation between ω, V and D given by the
                    expression</p>
               <p>ω = 2V∕D (5)</p>
               <p>Here D is in feet, V in feet per second and ω in radians per second, If the
                    speed is given in miles per hour, S say,</p>
               <p>V = 1∙466S (6)</p>
               <p>The revolutions of the axle per second, <hi rend="italic">n</hi> , are
                    connected with the radians turned through per second by the relation</p>
               <p>n=ω∕2π = ω∕6∙38 (7)</p>
               <p>§ 2. <hi rend="italic">Methods of Applying Locomotive Power. —</hi> By
                    locomotive</p>
               <p>power is to be understood the provision of power to maintain the rates of
                    working on the driving-axles of a train indicated by the relation (4). The most
                    usual way of providing this power is by the combustion of coal in the fire-box
                    of a boiler and the utilization of the steam produced in a steam-engine, both
                    boiler and engine being carried on a frame mounted on wheels in such a way that
                    the crank-shaft of the steam-engine becomes the driving-axle of the train. From
                    equation (3) it is clear that the wheels of the driving-axle must be heavily
                    loaded in order that F may have a value sufficiently great to propel the train.
                    The maximum weight which one pair of wheels are usually allowed to carry on a
                    first-class track is from 18 to 20 tons. If a larger</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0843" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0868.jp2"/>
               <p>value of the tractive force is required than this provides for, namely from 4 to
                    5 tons, the driving-wheels are coupled to one or more pairs of heavily loaded
                    wheels, forming a class of what are called “ coupled engines ” in
                    contradistinction to the “ single engine ” with a single pair of loaded
                    driving-wheels. Mechanical energy may be developed in bulk at a central station
                    conveniently situated with regard to a coal-field or a waterfall, and after
                    transformation by means of electric generators into electric energy it may be
                    transmitted to the locomotive and then by means of electric motors be
                    retransformed into mechanical energy at the axles to which the motors are
                    applied. Every axle of an electric locomotive may thus be subjected to a torque,
                    and the large weight which must be put on one pair of wheels in order to secure
                    sufficient adhesion when all the driving is done from one axle may be
                    distributed through as many pairs of wheels as desired. In fact, there need be
                    no specially differentiated locomotive at all. Motors may be applied to every
                    axle in the train, and their individual torques adjusted to values suitable to
                    the weights naturally carried by the several axles. Such an arrangement would be
                    ideally perfect from the point of view of the permanent-way engineer, because it
                    would then be possible to distribute the whole of the load uniformly between the
                    wheels. This perfection of distribution is practically attained in present-day
                    practice by the multiple control system of operating an electric train, where
                    motors are applied to a selected number of axles in the train, all of them being
                    under the perfect control of the driver.</p>
               <p>The fundamental difference between the two methods is that while the mechanical
                    energy developed by a steam engine is in the first case applied directly to the
                    driving-axle of the loco-motive, in the second case it is transformed into
                    electrical energy, transmitted over relatively long distances, and retransformed
                    into mechanical energy on the driving-axles of the train. In the first case all
                    the driving is done on one or at most two axles, sufficient tractive force being
                    obtained by coupling these axles when necessary to others carrying heavy loads.
                    In the second case every axle in the train may be made a driving-axle if
                    desired, in which case the locomotive as a separate machine disappears. In the
                    second case, however, there are all the losses due to transmission from the
                    central station to the train to be considered, as well as the cost of the
                    transmitting apparatus itself. Ultimately the question resolves itself into one
                    of commercial practicability. For suburban traffic with a service at a few
                    minutes’ interval and short distances between the stations electric traction has
                    proved itself to be superior in many respects to the steam locomotive, but for
                    main line traffic and long distance runs it has not yet been demonstrated that
                    it is commercially feasible, though it is known to be practically possible. For
                    the methods of electric traction see Traction; the remainder of the present
                    article will be devoted to the steam locomotive.</p>
               <p>§ 3. <hi rend="italic">General Efficiency of Steam Locomotive.</hi> —One pound
                    of good Welsh coal properly burned in the fire-box of a locomotive yields about
                    15, 000 British thermal units of heat at a temperature high enough to enable
                    from 50 to 80 % to flow across the boiler-heating surface to the water, the rest
                    escaping up the chimney with the furnace gases. The steam produced in
                    consequence of this heat transference from the furnace gas to the water carries
                    heat to the cylinder, where 7 to 11% is transformed into mechanical energy, the
                    remainder passing away up the chimney with the exhaust steam. The average value
                    of the product of these percentages, namely 0·65×0·09 = 0·×06 say, may be used
                    to investigate generally the working of a locomotive; the actual value could
                    only be detcr-mined by experiment in any particular case. With this assumption,
                    0·06 is the fraction of the heat energy of the coal which is utilized in the
                    engine cylinders as mechanical work; that is to say, of the 15, 000 B. Th. U.
                    produced by the combustion of 1 lb of coal, 15, 000×0·06 = 900 only are

               <p>Coals vary much in calorific value, some producing only 12, 000 B. Th. U. per lb

               <p>A “ perfect engine ” receiving and rejecting steam at the same</p>

                    this power, say 1400 LH. P. This figure represents the ideal but unattainable
                    standard of performance. This question of the standard engine of comparison, and

               <p>The indicated horse-power developed by a cylinder may always be ascertained from

               <p>I. H. P. =2 <hi rend="italic">plan⁄550</hi> (8)</p>
               <p>The I. H. P. at any instant is equal to the total rate at which energy is
                    required to overcome the tractive resistance R. The horse-power available at the
                    driving-axle, conveniently called the brake horse-power, is from 20 to 30 % less
                    than the indicated horse-power, and the ratio, B. H. P. ⁄ I. H. P. =ϵ, is called
                    the mechanical efficiency of the steam engine. The relation between the b. h. p.
                    and the torque on the driving-axle is</p>
               <p>550 B. H. P. =Tω (9)</p>
               <p>It is usual with steam locomotives to regard the resistance R as</p>
               <p>including the frictional resistances between the cylinders and the driving-axle,
                    so that the rate at which energy is expended in moving the train is expressed
                    either by the product RV, or by the value of the indicated horse-power, the
                    relation between them being</p>
               <p>550 I. H. P. = RV (10)</p>
               <p>or in terms of the torque</p>
               <p>550 I. H. P. ×ϵ = RVϵ=Tω (11)</p>
               <p>The individual factors of the product RV may have any value consistent with
                    equation (10) and with certain practical conditions, so that for a given value
                    of the I. H. P. R must decrease if V increases. Thus if the maximum horse-power
                    which a locomotive can develop is 1000, the tractive resistance R, at 60 m. per
                    hour ( = 88 ft. per second) is R = (1000×550) ∕ 88=6250 ℔. If, however, the
                    speed is reduced to 15 m. per hour ( = 22 ft. per second) R increases to 25, 000
                    ℔. Thus an engine working at maximum power may be used to haul a relatively
                    light load at a high speed or a heavy load at a slow speed.</p>

                    the resistance due to the vehicles hauled by the engine, represented by R <hi
                        rend="sub"> g</hi> ;(2) the resistance of the engine and tender represented
                    by R <hi rend="sub">c</hi> . In each of these two cases the resistance can of
                    course be analysed into the six components set out in the above list.</p>
               <p>§ 5. <hi rend="italic">Vehicle Resistance and Draw-bar Pull.</hi> —The power
                    of the engine is applied to the vehicles through the draw-bar, so that the
                    draw-bar pull is a measure of the vehicle resistance. The draw-bar pull for a
                    given load is a function of the speed of the train, and numerous experiments
                    have been made to find the relation connecting the pull with the speed under
                    various conditions. The usual way of experimenting is to put a dynamometer car
                    (see Dynamometer) between the engine and the train. This car is equipped with
                    apparatus by means of which a continuous record of the draw-bar pull is obtained
                    on a distance base; time indications are also made on the diagram from which the
                    speed at any instant can be deduced. The pull recorded on the diagram includes
                    the resistances due to acceleration and to the gradient on which the train is
                    moving. It is usual to subtract these resistances from the observed pull, so as
                    to obtain the draw-bar pull reduced to what it would be at a uniform speed on
                    the level. This corrected pull is then divided by the weight of the vehicles
                    hauled, in which must be included the weight of the dynamometer car, and the
                    quotient gives the resistance per ton of load hauled at a certain uniform speed
                    on a straight and level road. A series of experiments were made by J. A. F.
                    Aspinall on the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire railway to ascertain the
                    resistance of trains of bogie passenger carriages of different lengths at
                    varying speeds, and the results are recorded in a paper, “ Train Resistance, ” <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. C. E.</hi> (1901), vol. 147. Aspinall’s
                    results are expressed by the formula</p>

                    47 to 77 m. per hour. (16) All the above formulae refer to carriage stock. The
                    resistance of goods wagons has not been so systematically investigated. In the
                    paper above quoted Aspinall cites a case where the resistance of a train of
                    empty wagons 1830 ft. long was 18∙33 ℔ per ton at a speed of 26 m. per hour, and
                    a train of full wagons 1045 ft. long gave only 9·12 ℔ per ton at a speed of 29
                    m. per hour. The resistance found from the above expressions includes the
                    components 1, 2 and 4 of § 4. The resistance caused by the wind is very
                    variable, and in extreme cases may double the resistance found from the
                    formulae. A side wind causes excessive flange friction on the leeward side of
                    the train, and increases the tractive resistances therefore very considerably,
                    even though its velocity be relatively moderate. The curves corresponding to the
                    above expressions are plotted in fig. 17, four values of L being taken for
                    formula (12) corresponding to trains of 5, 10, 15 and 20 bogie carriages.</p>
               <p>The resistance at starting is greater than the running resistance at moderate
                    speeds. From Aspinall's experiments it appears to be about 17 ℔ per ton, and
                    this value is plotted on the diagram.</p>
               <p>The resistance to motion round a curve has not been so systematically studied
                    that any definite rule can be formulated applicable to all classes of rolling
                    stock and all radii of curves. A general result could not be obtained, even from
                    a large number of experiments, because the resistance round curves depends upon
                    so many variable factors. In some cases the gauge is laid a little wider than
                    the standard, and there are varying amounts of superelevation of the outer rail;
                    but the most formidable factor in the production of resistance is the
                    guard-rail, which is sometimes put in with the object of guiding the wheel which
                    runs on the inner rail of the curve on the inside of the flange.</p>
               <p>§ 6. <hi rend="italic">Engine Resistance. —</hi> From experiments made on the
                    North-Eastern railway (see a paper by W. H. Smith on “ Express Locomotive
                    Engines, ” <hi rend="italic">Proc. Inst. Meeh. Eng.,</hi> October 1898), it
                    appeared that the engine resistance was about 35 % of the total resistance, and
                    in the train-resistance experiments on the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire
                    railway quoted above the engine resistance was also about 35 % of the total
                    resistance, thus confirming the North-Eastern railway results. Barbier <hi
                        rend="italic"> (loc. cit. )</hi> gives as the formula for the engine
                    resistance</p>
               <p>r <hi rend="sub">c</hi> =8∙51+3∙24S(1∙61S+30) ∕ 1000 (17)</p>
               <p>where S is the speed in miles per hour. This formula is valid between speeds of
                    37 and 77 m. per hour, and was obtained in connexion with the experiments
                    previously quoted on the Northern railway of France with an engine and tender
                    weighing about 83 tons. Barbier's formula is plotted in fig. 17, together with a
                    curve expressing generally the results of some early experiments on the Great
                    Western railway carried out by Sir D. Gooch. The extension of the Barbier curve
                    beyond the above limits in fig. 17 gives values which must be regarded as only
                    very approximate.</p>

                    be done in the engine cylinders in order to maintain the train in motion at a
                    stated speed can be computed by the aid of the curves plotted in fig. 17. Thus
                    let an engine and tender weighing 80 tons haul vehicles weighing 200 tons at a
                    uniform speed on the level of 40 m. per hour. As given by the Barbier curves in
                    fig. 17, the engine resistance at 40 m. per hour is 20 ℔ per ton, and the
                    vehicle resistance 8·5 ℔ per ton at the same speed. Hence</p>

               <p>§ 8. <hi rend="italic">Rate at which work is done against a gradient. —</hi> Gradients are measured either by stating the number of feet horizontally, G say,
                    in which the vertical rise is 1 ft., or by the vertical rise in 100 ft. measured
                    horizontally expressed as a percentage, or by the number of feet rising
                    vertically in a mile. Thus a gradient of 1 in 200 is the same as a half per
                    cent. grade or a rise of 26·4 ft. per mile. The difference between the
                    horizontal distance and the distance measured along the rail is so small that it
                    is negligible in all practical calculations. Hence if a train is travelling up
                    the gradient at a speed of V ft. per second, the vertical rise per second is V/G

                    train had changed its speed from 41 to 40 m. per hour in 13 seconds, the rate at
                    which work would have to be absorbed by the brake blocks would represent 237 H.
                    P. This is lost in heat produced by the friction between the brake blocks and
                    the wheels, though in some systems of electric driving some of the energy stored
                    in the train may be returned to the central station during retardation. The
                    principal condition operating in the design of locomotives intended for local
                    services with frequent stops is the degree of acceleration required, the aim of
                    the designer being to produce an engine which shall be able to bring the train
                    to its journey speed in the shortest time possible. For example, suppose it is
                    required to start a train weighing 200 tons from rest and bring it to a speed of
                    30 m. per hour in 30 seconds. The weight of the engine may be assumed in advance
                    to be 80 tons. The acceleration, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which may be
                    supposed uniform, is 1∙465. The average velocity is 15 m. per hour, which is
                    equal to 22 ft. per second; therefore the tractive force required is, from (19),</p>
               <p>(280 ×2240×1·465)/32= 28, 720 ℔, and the corresponding horse-power which must be
                    developed in the cylinders is, from (20), <hi rend="italic">f</hi> V∕55o, and
                    this is with <hi rend="italic">f</hi> and V equal to the above values, 1149.
                    To obtain the tractive force the weight on the coupled wheels must be about five
                    times this amount—that is.</p>

               <p>This expression may be used to find <hi rend="italic">r <hi rend="sub">v</hi></hi> when the total draw-bar pull is observed as well as the speed, the changes
                    of speed and the gradient. The speed held to correspond with the resistance must
                    be the mean speed during the change of speed. The best way of deducing <hi
                        rend="italic"> r <hi rend="sub">v</hi></hi> is to select portions of the dynamometer record where the speed is
                    constant. Then <hi rend="italic">a</hi> disappears from all the above
                    expressions. These expressions indicate what frequent changes in the power are
                    required as the train pursues its journey up and down gradients, against wind
                    resistance, journal friction and perhaps the resistance of a badly laid track;
                    and show how both the potential energy and kinetic energy of the train are
                    continually changing: the first from a change in vertical position due to the
                    gradients, the second from changes in speed. These considerations also indicate
                    what a difficult matter it is to find the exact rate of working against the
                    resistances, because of the difficulty of securing conditions which eliminate

               <p>§ 11. <hi rend="italic">The Boiler. —Maximum Power. —</hi> The maximum power
                    which can be developed by a locomotive depends upon the maximum rate of fuel
                    combustion which can be maintained per square foot of grate. This maximum rate
                    depends upon the kind of coal used, whether small, friable, bituminous or hard,
                    upon the thickness of the fire, and upon the correct design and setting of the
                    blast-pipe. A limit is reached to the rate of combustion when the draught
                    becomes strong enough to carry heavy lighted sparks through the tubes and
                    chimney. This, besides reducing the efficiency of the furnace, introduces the
                    danger of fire to crops and buildings near the line. The maximum rate of
                    combustion may be as much as 150 ℔ of coal per square foot of grate per hour,
                    and in exceptional cases even a greater rate than this has been maintained. It
                    is not economical to force the boiler to work at too high a rate, because it has
                    been practically demonstrated that the boiler efficiency decreases after a
                    certain point, as the rate of combustion increases. A few experimental results
                    are set forth in Table XX., from which it will be seen that with a relatively
                    low rate of combustion, a rate which denotes very light service, namely 28 lb of
                    coal per square foot of grate per hour, the efficiency of the boiler is 82%,
                    which is as good a result as can be obtained with the best class of stationary
                    boiler or marine boiler even when using economizers.</p>
               <p>The first group consists of experiments selected from the records of a large
                    number made on the boiler of the locomotive belonging to the Purdue University,
                    Indiana, U. S. A.</p>
               <p>The second group consists of experiments made on a boiler belonging to the Great
                    Eastern Railway Company. The first one of the group was made on the boiler fixed
                    in the locomotive yard at St rat-ford, and the two remaining experiments of the
                    group were made while the engine was working a train between London and March.</p>
               <p>The third group consists of experiments selected from the records of a series of
                    trials made on the London &amp; South-Western railway with an express
                    locomotive.</p>

               <p>Great Eastern Railway Company. In the case of the London &amp; North-Western
                    engine (fig. 18), the blast-pipe orifice B is placed at about the centre of the
                    boiler barrel, and the exhaust steam is discharged straight into the
                    trumpet-shaped end of the chimney, which is continued down inside the smoke-box.
                    In fig. 19 the blast orifice B is set much lower, and the steam is discharged
                    through a frustum of a cone set in the upper part of the smoke-box into the
                    short chimney. Fig. 20 shows the standard proportions recommended by the
                    committee of the Railway Master Mechanics’ Association on Exhaust Pipes and
                    Steam Passages ( <hi rend="italic">Proc. Amer. Railway Master Mechanics'

               <p>According to the Report, for the best results both H and <hi rend="italic">h</hi> should be made as great as practicable, and then <hi rend="italic">d =</hi> 0∙21D+ 0∙16 <hi rend="italic">h</hi> , <hi rend="italic">b = 2d</hi> or 0∙5D, P=0∙32D, <hi rend="italic">p</hi> = 0∙22D, L=0∙6D or 0∙9D, but not of
                    intermediate values. This last relation is, however, not well established. For
                    much detailed information regarding American smoke-box practice, reference may
                    be made to <hi rend="italic">Locomotive Sparks,</hi> by Professor W. F. M.
                    Goss (London, 1902).</p>
               <p>The arrangements for arresting sparks in American practice and on the continent
                    of Europe are somewhat elaborate. In</p>
               <p>English practice where a spark-arrester is put in it usually takes the form of a
                    wire-netting dividing the smoke-box horizontally into two parts at a level just
                    above the top row of tubes, or arranged to form a continuous connexion between
                    the blast-pipe and the chimney.</p>
               <p>Fig. 19 illustrates an arrangement designed by J. Holden. The heavy sparks are
                    projected from the tubes in straight lines and are caught by the louvres L, L,
                    L, and by them deflected downwards to the bottom of the smoke-box, where they
                    collect in a heap in the space D round a tube which is essentially an ejector.
                    At every blast a small quantity of steam is caught by the orifice O and led to
                    the ejectors, one on each side, with the result that the ashes are blown out
                    into the receptacles on each side of the engine, one of which is shown at E. The
                    louvres <hi rend="italic">l, 1, 1</hi> are placed to shield the central region
                    occupied by the blast-pipe.</p>
               <p>As the indicated horse-power of the engine increases, the weight of steam
                    discharged increases, and the smoke-box vacuum is increased, thereby causing
                    more air to flow through the furnace and increasing the rate of combustion. Thus
                    the demand for more steam is automatically responded to by the boiler. It is
                    this close automatic interdependence of engine and boiler which makes the
                    locomotive so extraordinarily well suited for the purpose of locomotive
                    traction.</p>
               <p>§ 13. <hi rend="italic">The Steam Engine. —</hi> The steam engine of a
                    locomotive has the general characteristics of a double-acting non-condensing
                    engine (see Steam Engine). Distribution of steam is effected by a slide valve,
                    sometimes fitted with a balancing device, and sometimes formed into a piston
                    valve. All types of valves are with few exceptions operated by a link motion,
                    generally of the Stephenson type, occasionally of the Allan type or the Gooch
                    type, or with some form of radial gear as the Joy gear or the Walschaert gear,
                    though the latter gear has characteristics which ally it with the link motions.
                    The Stephenson link motion is used almost universally in England and America,
                    but it has gradually been displaced by the Walschaert gear on the continent of
                    Europe, and to some extent in England by the Joy gear. The general
                    characteristics of the distribution effected by these gears are similar. Each of
                    them, besides being a reversing gear, is an expansion gear both in forward and
                    back-ward running. The lead is variable in the Stephenson link motion, whilst in
                    the Walschaert and the Joy gears it is con-stant. Illustrations of these gears
                    are given in the article Steam Engine, and the complete distribution of steam
                    for both forward and backward running is worked out for a typical example of
                    each of them in <hi rend="italic">Valves and Valve Gear Mechanisms</hi> by W.
                    E. Dalby (London, 1906).</p>
               <p>§ 14. <hi rend="italic">Cylinder Dimensions. —Adhesion. —Tractive Force. —</hi> A locomotive must be designed to fulfil two conditions. First, it must be
                    able to exert a tractive force sufficient to start the train under the worst
                    conditions possible on the railway over which it is to operate—for instance,
                    when the train is stopped by signal on a rising gradient where the track is
                    curved and fitted with a guard-rail. Secondly, it must be able to maintain the
                    train at a given speed against the total resistances of the level or up a
                    gradient of given inclination. These conditions are to a certain extent mutually
                    antagonistic, since an engine designed to satisfy either condition independently
                    of the other would be a different engine from that designed to make the best
                    corn-promise between them.</p>
               <p>Equation (3), § 1 expresses the fundamental condition which must be satisfied
                    when a locomotive is starting a train. The torque exerted on the driving-axle by
                    the steam engine just at starting may be that due to the full boiler pressure
                    acting in the cylinders, but usually the weight on the coupled wheels is hardly
                    sufficient to enable advantage to be taken of the full boiler pressure, and it
                    has to be throttled down by the regulator to prevent slipping. Sand, driven
                    between the wheel and the rail by a steam jet, used just at starting, increases
                    the adhesion beyond the normal value and enables a larger pressure to be exerted
                    on the piston than would otherwise be possible. When the train is started and is
                    moving slowly, the torque acting on the driving-axle may be estimated as that
                    due to about 85% of the full boiler pressure acting in the cylinders. The torque</p>

               <p>due to the two cylinders is variable to a greater or less extent, depending upon
                    the degree of expansion in the cylinders and the speed. The form of the torque
                    curve, or crank effort curve, as it is sometimes called, is discussed in the
                    article Steam Engine, and the torque curve corresponding to actual indicator
                    diagrams taken from an express passenger engine travelling at a speed of 65 m.

                    Dalby (London, 1906).</p>
               <p>The plotting of the torque curve is laborious, but the average torque acting,
                    which is all that is required for the purposes of this article, can be found
                    quite simply, thus: —Let <hi rend="italic">p</hi> be the mean effective
                    pressure acting in one cylinder, <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> the area of the
                    cylinder, and Z, the stroke. Then the work done during one revolution of the
                    crank is <hi rend="italic">2pla</hi> per cylinder. Assuming that the mean
                    pressure in the other cylinder is also <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> the total
                    work done per revolution is 4 <hi rend="italic">pla</hi> . If T is the mean
                    torque, the work done on the crank-axle per revolution is 2πT. Hence assuming
                    the mechanical efficiency of the engine to be ϵ, and substituting^ <hi
                        rend="italic"> d</hi> <hi rend="sup">2</hi> for the area <hi rend="italic">a,</hi></p>
               <p>2πT <hi rend="italic">=4plaϵ = plπd <hi rend="sup">2ϵ</hi></hi></p>
               <p>so that</p>
               <p>T = ½ <hi rend="italic">pd</hi> <hi rend="sup">2</hi> <hi rend="italic">lϵ.</hi></p>
               <p>But from § 1, T = ½DF;</p>
               <p>therefore F = <hi rend="italic">pd</hi> <hi rend="sup">2</hi> <hi rend="italic">lϵ</hi> ∕D (25)</p>
               <p>F in this expression is twice the average magnitude of the equal and opposite
                    forces constituting the couple for one driving-wheel illustrated in fig. 16, one
                    force of which acts to propel the train whilst the other is the value of the
                    tangential frictional resistance between the wheel and the rail. This force F
                    must not exceed the value μW or slipping will take place. Hence, if <hi
                        rend="italic"> p</hi> is the maximum value of the mean effective pressure
                    corresponding to about 85% of the boiler pressure,</p>
               <p>μW = <hi rend="italic">pd</hi> <hi rend="sup">2</hi> <hi rend="italic">lϵ∕D</hi> (26)</p>
               <p>is an expression giving a relation between the total weight on the coupled
                    wheels, their diameters and the size of the cylinder. The magnitude of F when <hi rend="italic">p</hi> and ϵ are put each equal to unity, is usually
                    called the tractive force of the locomotive per pound of mean effective pressure
                    in the cylinders. If <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is the mean pressure at any
                    speed the total tractive force which the engine is exerting is given by equation
                    (25) above. The value of ϵ is variable, but is between •7 and ∙8, and for
                    approximate calculations may be taken equal to unity. In the following examples
                    the value will be assumed unity.</p>
               <p>These relations may be illustrated by an example. Let an engine have two
                    cylinders each 19 in. diameter and 26 in. stroke. Let the boiler pressure be 175
                    ℔ per square inch. Taking 85% of this, the maximum mean effective pressure would
                    be 149 ℔ per square inch. Further, let the diameter of the driving-wheels be 6
                    ft. 3 in. Then the tractive force is, from (25),</p>
               <p>(149 × 19 <hi rend="sup">2</hi> × 2 ∙ 166)∕6∙25 = 18, 600℔ = 8∙3 tons.</p>
               <p>Assuming that the frictional resistance at the rails is given by ⅕ the weight on
                    the wheels, the total weight on the driving-wheels necessary to secure
                    sufficient adhesion to prevent slipping must be at least 8∙3 ×5 = 41 ∙5 tons.
                    This would be distributed between three coupled axles giving an average of 1∙38
                    tons per axle, though the distribu-tiop might not in practice be uniform, a
                    larger proportion of the weight falling on the driving-axle. If the starting
                    resistance of the whole train be estimated at 16 ℔ per ton, this engine would be
                    able to start 1·163 tons on the level, or about 400 tons on a gradient of I in
                    75, both these figures including the weight of the engine and tender, which
                    would be about 100 tons.</p>
               <p>The engine can only exert this large tractive force so long as the mean pressure
                    is maintained at 149 ℔ per square inch. This high mean pressure cannot be
                    maintained for long, because as the speed increases the demand for steam per
                    unit of time increases, so that cut-off must take place earlier and earlier in
                    the stroke, the limiting steady speed being attained when the rate at which
                    steam is supplied to the cylinders is adjusted by the cut-off to be equal to the
                    maximum rate at which the boiler can produce steam, which depends upon the
                    maximum rate at which coal can be burnt per square foot of grate. If C is the
                    number of pounds of coal burnt per square foot of grate per hour, the calorific
                    value of which is <hi rend="italic">c</hi> B. Tn. U. per pound, the maximum

               <p>where A is the area of the grate in square feet, and η is the combined
                    efficiency of the engine and boiler. With the data of the previous example, and
                    assuming in addition that the grate area is 24 sq. ft., that the rate of
                    combustion is 150 ℔ of coal per square foot of grate per hour, that the
                    calorific value is 14000, and finally that <hi rend="italic">η</hi> =0·06, the

                    would be 0∙06×150 ×14000×24×778/1980000 = 1190, corresponding to a mean
                    effective pressure in the cylinders of 59∙5 lb per square inch.</p>
               <p>Assuming that the train is required to run at a speed of 60 m. per hour, that is
                    88 ft. per second, the total resistance R, which the engine can overcome at this
                    speed, is by equation (10)</p>
               <p>R = (1190×550)∕88 = 7∙400 ℔.</p>
               <p>Thus although at a slow speed the engine can exert a tractive force of 18, 600
                    lb, at 60 m. per hour, the tractive force falls to 7400 ℔, and this cannot be
                    increased except by increasing the rate of combustion (neglecting any small
                    changes due to a change in the efficiency <hi rend="italic">η)</hi> . Knowing
                    the magnitude of R, the draw-bar pull, and hence the weight of vehicle the
                    engine can haul at this speed, can be estimated if the resistances are known.
                    Using the curves of fig. 17 it will be found that at 60 m. per hour the
                    resistance of the engine and tender is 33 lb per ton, and the resistance of a
                    train of bogie coaches about 14 lb per ton. Hence if W is the weight of the
                    vehicles in tons, and the weight of the engine and tender be taken at 100 tons,
                    the value of W can be found from the equation 14W+3300=7440, from which W = 296
                    tons. This is the load which the engine would take in ordinary weather. With
                    exception-ally bad weather the load would have to be reduced or two engines
                    would have to be employed, or an exceptionally high rate of combustion would
                    have to be maintained in the fire-box.</p>
               <p>lt will be seen at once that with a tractive force of 7400 lb a weight of 37,
                    000 lb ( = 16∙5 tons) would be enough to secure sufficient adhesion, and this
                    could be easily carried on one axle. Hence for a level road the above load could
                    be hauled at 60 m. per hour with a “ single ” engine. When the road leads the
                    train up an incline, however, the tractive force must be increased, so that the
                    need for coupled wheels soon arises if the road is at all a heavy one.</p>

                    The corresponding boiler efficiencies are given in the third column of the
                    table, when they are known, and the combined efficiencies ĩn the fourth column.
                    The figures in this column indicate that 0∙06 is a good average value to work
                    with.</p>

               <p>It is instructive to inquire into the limiting efficiency of an engine
                    consistent with the conditions under which it is working, because in no case can
                    the efficiency of a steam-engine exceed a certain value which depends upon the
                    temperatures at which</p>

               <p>it receives and rejects heat. Thus a standard of comparison for every individual
                    engine may be obtained with which to compare its actual performance. The
                    standard of comparison generally adopted for this purpose is obtained by
                    calculating the efficiency of an engine working according to the Rankine cycle.
                    That is to say, expansion is adiabatic and is continued down to the back
                    pressure which in a non-condensing engine is 14·7 ℔ per square inch, since any
                    back pressure above this amount is an imperfection which belongs to the actual
                    engine. The back pressure is supposed to be uniform, and there is no
                    compression.</p>
               <p>Fig. 21 shows the pressure-volume diagram of the Rankine cycle for one pound of
                    steam where the initial pressure is 175 ℔ per square inch by the gauge,
                    equivalent to 190 ℔ per square inch absolute. In no case could an engine
                    receiving steam at the tem-perature corre-sponding to this pressure and
                    reject-ing heat at 212° F. convert more heat into work than is represented by
                    the area of this diagram. The area of the diagram may be measured, but it is
                    usually more convenient to calculate the number of B. Th. U. which the area
                    represents from the following formula, which is expressed in terms of the
                    absolute temperature Τ <hi rend="sub">1</hi> of the steam at the steam-pipe,
                    and the temperature T <hi rend="sub">2</hi> =461 <hi rend="sup">o</hi> +212 <hi rend="sup">o</hi></p>

               <p>That is to say, a perfect engine working between the limits of temperature
                    assigned would convert only 18% of the total heat supply into work. This would
                    be an ideal performance for an engine receiving steam at 190 ℔ initial pressure
                    absolute, and rejecting steam at the back pressure assumed above, and could
                    never be attained in practice. When the initial pressure is 100 lb per square
                    inch by the gauge the thermal efficiency drops to about nearly 15% with the same
                    back pressure. The way the thermal efficiency of the ideal engine increases with
                    the pressure is exhibited in fig. 22 by the curve AB. The curve was drawn by
                    calculating the thermal efficiency from the above expression for various values
                    of the initial temperature, keeping the final temperature constant at 673 <hi
                        rend="sup"> o</hi> , and then plotting these efficiencies against the
                    corresponding values of the gauge pressures.</p>
               <p>The actual thermal efficiencies observed in some of the cases cited in Table XXL
                    are plotted on the diagram, the reference numbers on which refer to the first
                    column in the table. Thus the</p>
               <p>cross marked 3 in fig. 22 represents the thermal efficiency actually obtained in
                    one of Adams and Pettigrew’s experiments, namely, 0∙11,</p>
               <p>the pressure in the steam-pipe being 167 ℔ per square inch. From the diagram it
                    will be seen that the corresponding efficiency of the ideal engine is about
                    0∙18. The efficiency ratio is therefore 0∙11∕0∙18 = 0∙61. That is to say, the
                    engine actually utilized 61 % of the energy which it was possible to utilize by
                    means of a perfect engine working with the same initial pressure against a back
                    pressure equal to the atmosphere. Lines representing efficiency ratios of 0∙6,
                    0∙5 and o∙4 are plotted on the diagram, so that the efficiency ratios
                    corre-sponding to the various experiments plotted may be readily read off. The
                    initial temperature of the standard engine of comparison must be the temperature
                    of the steam taken in the steam-pipe. For further information regarding the

               <p>§ 17. <hi rend="italic">Compound Locomotives. —</hi> The thermal efficiency of
                    a steam-engine is in general increased by carrying out the expansion of the
                    steam in two, three or even more stages in separate cylinders, notwithstanding
                    the inevitable drop of pressure which must occur when the steam is transferred
                    from one cylinder to the other during the process of expansion. Compound working
                    permits of a greater range of expansion than is possible with a simple engine,
                    and incidentally there is less range of pressure per cylinder, so that the
                    pressures and temperatures per cylinder have not such a wide range of variation.
                    In compound working the combined volumes of the low-pressure cylinders is a
                    measure of the power of the engine, since this represents the final volume of
                    the steam used per stroke. The volume of the high-pressure cylinder may be
                    varied within wide limits for the same low-pressure volume; the proportions
                    adopted should, however, be such that there is an absence of excessive drop
                    between them as the steam is transferred from one to the other. Compound
                    locomotives have been built by various designers, but opinion is still uncertain
                    whether any commercial economy is obtained by their use. The varying load
                    against which a locomotive works, and the fact that a locomotive is
                    non-condensing, are factors which reduce the margin of possible economy within
                    narrow limits. Coal-saving can be shown to the extent of about 14% in some
                    cases, but the saving depends upon the kind of service on which the engine is
                    employed. The first true compound locomotive was constructed in 1876 from
                    designs by A. M. Mallet, at the Creusot works in Bayonne. The first true
                    compound locomotive in England was constructed at Crewe works in 1878 by F. W.
                    Webb. It was of the same type as Mallet’s engine, and was made by simply bushing
                    one cylinder of an ordinary two-cylinder simple engine, the bushed cylinder
                    being the high-pressure and the other cylinder the low-pressure cylinder. Webb
                    evolved the type of three-cylinder compound with which his name is associated in
                    1882.</p>

               <p>There were two high-pressure cylinders placed outside the frames and driving on
                    a trailing wheel, and one low-pressure cylinder placed between the frames and
                    driving on a wheel placed in front of the driving-wheel belonging to the
                    high-pressure cylinders. The steam connexions were such that the two
                    high-pressure cylinders were placed in parallel, both cx-hausting into the one
                    low-pressure cylinder. The first engines of this class were provided with
                    high-pressure cylinders, 11 in. diameter and 24 in. stroke, a low-pressure
                    cylinder 26 in. diameter, 24 in. stroke, and driving-wheels 6 ft. 6 in.
                    diameter; but subsequently these dimensions were varied. There were no coupling
                    rods. A complete account of Webb’s engines will be found in a paper, “ The
                    Compound Principle applied to Locomotives, ” by E. Worthington, <hi
                        rend="italic"> Proc. Inst. C. E.,</hi> 1889, vol. xcvi. Locomotives have to
                    start with the full load on the engine, consequently an outstanding feature of
                    every compound locomotive is the apparatus or mechanism added to enable the
                    engine to start readily. Generally steam from the boiler is admitted direct to
                    the low-pressure cylinder through a reducing valve, and valves and devices are
                    used to prevent the steam so admitted acting as a back pressure on the
                    high-pressure cylinder. In the Webb compound the driver opened communication
                    from the high-pressure exhaust pipe to the blast-pipe, and at the same time
                    opened a valve giving a supply of steam from the boiler direct to the
                    low-pressure valve chest. T. W. Worsdell developed the design of the
                    two-cylinder compound in England and built several, first for the Great Eastern
                    railway and subsequently for the North-Eastern railway. The engines were built
                    on the Worsdell and Von Borrics plan, and were fitted with an ingenious
                    starting-valve of an automatic character to overcome the difficulties of
                    starting. Several compounds of a type introduced by W. M. Smith on the
                    North-Eastern railway in 1898 have been built by the Midland railway. In these
                    there are two low-pressure cylinders placed outside the frame, and one
                    high-pressure cylinder placed between the frames. All cylinders drive on one
                    crank-axle with three cranks at 120°. The driving-wheels are coupled to a pair
                    of trailing wheels. A controlling valve enables the supply of steam to the
                    low-pressure cylinders to be supplemented by boiler steam at a reduced pressure.
                    For a description and illustrations of the details of the starting devices used
                    in the Webb, Worsdell and Smith compounds, sec an article, “ The Development of
                    the Compound Locomotive in England, ” by W. E. Dalby in the <hi rend="italic">Engineering Magazine</hi> for September and October 1904. A famous type of
                    compound locomotive developed on the continent of Europe is the four-cylinder De
                    Glehn, some of which have been tried on the Great Western railway. There are two
                    high-pressure cylinders placed outside the frame, and two low-pressure placed
                    inside the frames. The low-pressure cylinders drive on the leading crank-axle
                    with cranks at right angles, the high-pressure cylinders driving on the trailing
                    wheels. The wheels are coupled, but the feature of the engine is that the
                    coupling-rods act merely to keep the high-pressure and low-pressure engines in
                    phase with one another, very little demand being made upon them to transmit
                    force except when one of the wheels begins to slip. In this arrangement the
                    whole of the adhesive weight of the engine is used in the best possible manner,
                    and the driving of the train is practically equally divided between two axles.
                    The engine can be worked as a four-cylinder simple at the will of the driver. S.
                    M. Vauclain introduced a successful type of four-cylinder compound in America in
                    1889. A high- and low-pressure cylinder are cast together, and the piston-rods
                    belonging to them are both coupled to one cross-head which is connected to the
                    driving-wheels, these again being coupled to other wheels in the usual way. The
                    distribution of steam to both cylinders is effected by one piston-valve operated
                    by a link motion, so that there is considerable mechanical simplicity in the
                    arrangement. Later Vauclain introduced the “ balanced compound. ” In this engine
                    the two piston-rods of one side are not coupled to a common cross-head, but
                    drive on separate cranks at an angle of 180°, the pair of 180° cranks on each
                    side being placed at right angles.</p>
               <p>§18. <hi rend="italic">The Balancing of Locomotives. —</hi> The unbalanced
                    masses of a locomotive may be divided into two parts, namely, masses which
                    revolve, as the crank-pins, the crank-cheeks, the coupling-rods, &amp;c.;
                    and masses which reciprocate, made up of the piston, piston-rod, cross-head and
                    a certain proportion of the connecting-rod. The revolving masses are truly
                    balanced by balance weights placed between the spokes of the wheels, or
                    sometimes by prolonging the crank-webs and forming the prolongation into balance
                    weights. It is also the custom to balance a proportion of the reciprocating
                    masses by balance weights placed between the spokes of the wheels, and the
                    actual balance weight seen in a driving-wheel is the resultant of the separate
                    weights required for the balancing of the revolving parts and the reciprocating
                    parts. The component of a balance weight which is necessary to balance the
                    reciprocating masses introduces a vertical unbalanced force which appears as a
                    variation of pressure between the wheel and the rail, technically called the
                    hammer-blow, the magnitude of which increases as the square of the speed of the
                    train. In consequence of this action the compromise is usually followed of
                    balancing only ⅔ of the reciprocating masses, thus keeping the hammer-blow
                    within proper limits, and allowing ⅓ of the reciprocating masses to be
                    unbalanced in the horizontal direction. It is not possible to do anything better
                    with two-cylinder locomotives unless bob-weights be added, but with
                    four-cylinder four-crank engines complete balance is possible both in the
                    vertical and in the horizontal directions. When the four cranks are placed with
                    two pairs at 180°, the pairs being at 90°, the forces are balanced without the
                    introduction of a hammer-blow, but there remain large unbalanced couples, which
                    if balanced by means of revolving weights in the wheels again reintroduce the
                    hammer-blow, and if left unbalanced tend to make the engine oscillate in a
                    horizontal plane at high speed. The principles by means of which the magnitude
                    and position of balance weights are worked out are given in the article
                    Mechanics ( <hi rend="italic">Applied Mechanics),</hi> and the whole subject
                    of locomotive balancing is exhaustively treated with numerous numerical examples
                    in <hi rend="italic">The Balancing of Engines</hi> by W. E. Dalby, London,
                    1906.</p>
               <p>§19. <hi rend="italic">Classification. —</hi> Locomotives may be classified
                    primarily into “ tender engines ’’ and “ tank engines, ’’ the water and fuel in
                    the latter being carried on the engine proper, while in the former they are
                    carried in a separate vehicle. A tender is generally mounted on six wheels, or
                    in some cases on two bogies, and carries a larger supply of water and fuel than
                    can be carried by tanks and the bunker of a tank engine. A tender, however, is
                    so much dead-weight to be hauled, whilst the weight of the water and fuel in a
                    tank engine contributes largely to the production of adhesion. A classification
                    may also be made, according to the work for which engines are designed, into
                    passenger engines, goods engines, and shunting or switching engines. A
                    convenient way of describing any type of engine is by means of numerals
                    indicating the number of wheels— (1) in the group of wheels supporting the
                    leading or chimney end, (2) in the group of coupled wheels, and (3) in the group
                    supporting the trailing end of the engine. In the case where cither the leading
                    or trailing group of small wheels is absent the numeral 0 must be used in the
                    scries of three numbers used in the description. Thus 4-4-2 represents a bogie
                    engine with four-coupled wheels and one pair of trailing wheels, the well-known
                    Atlantic type; 4-2-2 represents a bogie engine with a single pair of
                    driving-wheels and a pair of trailing wheels; 0-4-4 represents an engine with
                    four-coupled wheels and a trailing bogie, and 4-4-0 an engine with four-coupled
                    wheels and a leading bogie. A general description of the chief peculiarities of
                    various kinds of locomotives is given in the following analysis of types: —</p>

                    found in France, and less often in Germany, Italy, and elsewhere in Europe. It
                    is generally designed as a 4-2-2 engine, but some old types are still running
                    with only three axles,</p>

               <p>the 2-2-2. It is adapted for light, high-speed service, and noted for its
                    simplicity, excellent riding qualities, low cost of maintenance, and high
                    mechanical efficiency; but having limited adhesive weight it is unsuitable for
                    starting and accelerating heavy trains.</p>
               <p>(2) “ Four-coupled ” type, 4-4-0, with leading bogie truck. For many years this
                    was practically the only one used in America for all traffic, and it is often
                    spoken of as the “ American ” type. In America it is still the standard engine
                    for passenger traffic, but for goods service it is now employed only on branch
                    lines. It has been extensively introduced, both in Great Britain and the
                    continent of Europe, for passenger traffic, and is now the most numerous and
                    popular class. lt is a safe, steady-running and trustworthy engine, with
                    excellent distribution of weight, and it is susceptible of a wide range of
                    adaptability in power requirements.</p>
               <p>(3) “ Four-coupled ” three-axle type, 2-4-0. Used to some extent in France and
                    Germany and considerably in England for passenger traffic of moderate weight.
                    Engines of this class, with 78-înch driving wheels and the leading axle fitted
                    with Webb’s radial axle-box, for many years did excellent work on the London
                    &amp; North-Western railway. The famous engine “ Charles Dickens ” was one
                    of this class. Built in 1882, it had by the 12th of September 1891 performed the
                    feat of running a million miles in 9 years 219 days, and it completed two
                    million miles on the 5th of August 1902, having by that date run 5312 trips with
                    express trains between London and Manchester.</p>
               <p>(4) “ Four-coupled ” three-axle type, with trailing axle, 0-4-2. Used on several
                    English lines for fast passenger traffic, and also on many European railways.
                    The advantages claimed for it arc: short coupling-rods, large and unlimited
                    fire-box carried by a trailing axle, compactness, and great power for a given
                    weight. Its critics, however, accuse it of lack of stability, and assert that
                    the use of large leading wheels as drivers results in rigidity and produces
                    destructive strains on the machinery and permanent way.</p>
               <p>(5) “ Four-coupled ” type, with a leading bogie truck and a trailing axle,
                    4-4-2. It is used to a limited extent both in England and on the continent of
                    Europe, and is rapidly increasing in favour in the United States, where it
                    originated and is known as the “ Atlantic ” type. It has many advantages for
                    heavy high-speed service, namely, large and well-proportioned boiler,
                    practically unlimited grate area, fire-box of favourable proportions for firing,
                    fairly, low centre of gravity, short coupling-rods, and, finally, a combination
                    of the safe and smooth riding qualities of the four-coupled bogie type, with
                    great steaming capacity and moderate axle loads. Occasionally a somewhat similar
                    type is designed with the bogie under the fire-box and a single leading axle
                    forward under the smoke-box—an arrangement in favour for suburban tank engines.
                    In still rarer cases both a leading and a trailing bogie have been fitted.</p>
               <p>(6) “ Six-coupled ” with bogie, or “ Ten-wheel ” type, 4-6-0. A powerful engine
                    for heavy passenger and fast goods service. It is used to a limited extent both
                    in Great Britain and on the continent of Europe, but is much more common in
                    America. The design combines ample boiler capacity with large adhesive weight
                    and moderate axle loads, but except on heavy gradients or for unusually large
                    trains requiring engines of great adhesion, passenger traffic can be more
                    efficiently and economically handled by four-coupled locomotives of the
                    eight-wheel or Atlantic types.</p>
               <p>(7) “ Six-coupled ” total-adhesion type (all the weight carried on the drivers),
                    0-6-0. This is the standard goods engine of Great Britain and the continent of
                    Europe. In America the type is used only for shunting. It is a simple design of
                    moderate boiler power.</p>
               <p>(8) “ Six-coupled ” type, with a leading axle, 2-6-0. This is of American
                    origin, and is there known as the “ Mogul. ” It is used largely in America for
                    goods traffic. In Europe it is in considerable favour for goods and passenger
                    traffic on heavy gradients. The type is, however, less in favour than either the
                    ten-wheel or the eight-coupled “ Consolidation ” for freight traffic.</p>
               <p>(9) “ Eight-coupled " total-adhesion type, 0-8-0; now found on a good many
                    English railways, and common on the continent of Europe for heavy slow goods
                    traffic. In America it is comparatively infrequent, as total-adhesion types are
                    not in favour.</p>
               <p>(10) “ Eight-coupled ” type, with a leading axle, 2-8-0. This originated in
                    America, where it is termed the “Consolidation. ” In the United States it is the
                    standard heavy slow-speed freight engine, and has been built of enormous size
                    and weight. The type has been introduced in Europe, especially in Germany, where
                    the advantages of a partial-adhesion type in increased stability and a larger
                    boiler are becoming appreciated. Occasionally the American eight-coupled type
                    has a bogie instead of a single leading axle (4-8-0), and is then termed a “
                    Twelve-wheeler, ” or “ Mastodon. ”</p>
               <p>(11) “Ten-coupled” type, with a leading axle, 2-10-0. This originated in
                    America, where it is known as the “ Decapod. ” It is used to a limited extent
                    for mountain-grade goods traffic, and has the advantage over the “
                    Consolidation” or eight-coupled type of lighter axle loads for a given tractive
                    capacity.</p>
               <p>In addition to the foregoing list, various special locomotive types have been
                    developed for suburban service, where high rates of acceleration and frequent
                    stops are required. These are generally tank engines, carrying their fuel and
                    water on the engine proper.</p>
               <p>Their boilers are of relatively large proportions for the train weight and
                    average speed, and the driving wheels of small diameter, a large proportion of
                    their total weight being “ adhesive. ” Other special types are in limited use
                    for “ rack-railways, ” and operate either by engagement of gearing on the
                    locomotive into a rack between the track rails, or by a combination of this and
                    rail adhesion.</p>
               <p>§ 20. <hi rend="italic">Current Developments. —</hi> The demand of the present
                    day is for engines of larger power both for passenger and goods service, and the
                    problem is to design such engines within the limitations fixed by the 4 ft. 8½
                    in. gauge and the dimensions of the existing tunnels, arches, and other
                    permanent works. The American engineer is more fortunately situated than his
                    English brother with regard to the possibility of a solution, as will be seen
                    from the comparative diagrams of construction gauges, figs. 23, 24, 25, 26. Fig.
                    23 shows the construction gauge for the London &amp; North-Western railway,
                    fig. 24 that for the Great Western <note anchored="true" place="bottom"

                    railway, whilst fig. 26 gives a general idea of the American gauge in a
                    particular case, generally typical, however, of the American limits. In
                    consequence of this increasing demand for power, higher boiler pressures are
                    being used, in some cases 225 ℔ per sq. in, for a simple two-cylinder engine,
                    and cylinder volume is slightly increased with the necessary accompaniment of
                    heavier loads on the coupled wheels to give the necessary adhesion. Both load
                    and speed have increased so much in connexion with passenger trains that it is
                    necessary to divide the weight required for adhesion between three-coupled
                    axles, and the type of engine gradually coming into use in England for heavy
                    express traffic is a six-coupled engine with a leading bogie, with wheels which
                    would have been considered small a few years ago for the speed at which the
                    engine runs. The same remarks apply to goods engines. There is a general
                    increase in cylinder power, boiler pressure and weight, and in consequence in
                    the number of coupled axles. Not only are the load and speed increasing, but the
                    distances run without a stop are increasing also, and to avoid increasing the
                    size of the tenders, water-troughs, first instituted by J. Ramsbottom on the
                    London &amp; North-Western railway in 1859, have been laid in the tracks of
                    the leading main lines of Great Britain. For local services where stoppages are
                    frequent the demand is for engines capable of quickly</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0851" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0876.jp2"/>
               <p>accelerating the train to the journey speed. The nature of this problem is
                    illustrated by the numerical example in § 9. When the service is frequent enough
                    to give a good power factor continuously, the steam locomotive cannot compete
                    with the electric motor for the purpose of quick acceleration, because the
                    motors applied to the axles of a train may for a short time absorb power from
                    the central station to an extent far in excess of anything which a locomotive
                    boiler can supply.</p>
               <p>With regard to the working of the locomotive, J. Holden developed the use of
                    liquid fuel on the Great Eastern railway to a point beyond the experimental
                    stage, and used it instead of coal with the engines running the heavy express
                    traffic of the line, its continued use depending merely upon the relative market
                    price of coal and oil. Compound locomotives have been tried, as stated in § 17,
                    but the tendency in England is to revert to the simple engine for all classes of
                    work, though on the continent of Europe and in America the compound</p>
               <p>locomotive is largely adopted, and is doing excellent work. A current
                    development is the application of superheaters to locomotives, and the results
                    obtained with them are exceedingly promising.</p>
               <p>The leading dimensions of a few locomotives typical of English, American and
                    European practice are given in Table XXII.</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rolling Stock</hi></p>
               <p>The rolling stock of a railway comprises those vehicles by means of which it
                    effects the transportation of persons and things over its lines. It may be
                    divided into two classes, according as it is intended for passenger or for goods
                    traffic.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Passenger Train Stock, —</hi> In the United Kingdom, as in
                    Europe generally, the vehicles used on passenger trains include first-class
                    carriages, second-class carriages, third-class carriages, composite carriages
                    containing compartments for two or more classes of passengers, dining or
                    restaurant carriages, sleeping</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0852" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0877.jp2"/>
               <p>carriages, mail carriages or travelling post offices, luggage brake vans,
                    horse-boxes and carriage-trucks. Passenger carriages were originally modelled on
                    the stage-coaches which they superseded, and they are often still referred to as
                    “ coaching stock. ” Early examples had bodies about 15 ft. long, 6½ ft. wide and
                    4¾ ft. high; they weighed 3 or 4 tons, and were divided into three compartments
                    holding six persons each, or eighteen in all.</p>
               <p>The distinction into classes was made almost as soon as the railways began to
                    carry passengers. Those who paid the highest fares (2½d. or 3d. a mile) were
                    provided with covered vehicles, on the roofs of which their luggage was carried,
                    and from the circumstance that they could book seats in advance came the term “
                    booking office, ” still commonly applied to the office where tickets are issued.
                    Those who travelled at the cheaper rates had at the beginning to be content with
                    open carriages having little or no protection from the weather. Gradually,
                    however, the accommodation improved, and by the middle of the 19th century
                    second-class passengers had begun to enjoy “ good glass windows and cushions on
                    the seat, ” the fares they paid being about 2d. a mile. But though by an act of
                    1844 the railways were obliged to run at least one train a day over their lines,
                    by which the fares did not exceed the “ Parliamentary ” rate of 1d. a mile,
                    third-class passengers paying 1¼d. or 1½d. a mile had little consideration
                    bestowed on their comfort, and were excluded from the fast trains till 1872,
                    when the Midland railway admitted them to all its trains. Three years later that
                    railway did away with second-class compartments and improved the third class to
                    their level. This action had the effect, through the necessities of competition,
                    of causing travellers in the cheaper classes to be better treated on other
                    railways, and the condition of the third-class passenger was still further
                    improved when Parliament, by the Cheap Trains Act of 1883, required the railways
                    to provide “ due and sufficient ’’ train accommodation at fares not exceeding
                    1d. a mile. In the United Kingdom it is now possible to travel by every train,
                    with very few exceptions, and in many cases to have the use of restaurant cars,
                    for 1d. a mile or less, and the money obtained from third-class travellers forms
                    by far the most important item in the revenue from passenger traffic. Since the
                    Midland railway’s action in 1875 several other English companies have abandoned
                    second-class carriages either completely or in part, and in Scotland they are
                    entirely unknown.</p>
               <p>On the continent of Europe there are occasionally four classes, but though the
                    local fares are often appreciably lower than in Great Britain, only first and
                    second class, sometimes only first class, passengers are admitted to the fastest
                    trains, for which in addition a considerable extra fare is often required. In
                    Hungary and Russia a zone-tariff system is in operation, whereby the charge per
                    mile decreases progressively with the length of the journey, the traveller
                    paying according to the number of zones he has passed through and not simply
                    according to the distance traversed. In the United States there is in most cases
                    nominally only one class, denominated first class, and the average fare obtained
                    by the railways is about 1d. per mile per passenger. But the extra charges
                    levied for the use of parlour, sleeping and other special cars, of which some of
                    the best trains are exclusively composed, in practice constitute a
                    differentiation of class, besides making the real cost of travelling higher than
                    the figures just given.</p>
               <p>In America and other countries where distances are great and passengers have to
                    spend several days continuously in a train sleeping and resta urant cars are
                    almost a necessity, and accordingly are to be found on most important through
                    trains. Such cars in the United States are largely owned, not by the railway
                    companies over whose lines they run, but by the Pullman Car Company, which
                    receives the extra fees paid by passengers for their use. Similarly in Europe
                    they are often the property of the International Sleeping Car Company (Compagnie
                    Internationale des Wagons-Lits), and the supplementary fares required from those
                    who travel in them add materially to the cost of a journey. In the United
                    Kingdom, where the distances are comparatively small, sleeping and dining cars
                    must be regarded rather as luxuries; stiff even so, they are to be met with very
                    frequently. The first dining car in England was run experimentally by the Great
                    Northern railway between London and Leeds in 1879, and now such vehicles form a
                    common feature on express trains, being available for all classes of passengers
                    without extra charge beyond the amount payable for food. The introduction of
                    corridor carriages, enabling passengers to walk right through the trains,
                    greatly increased their usefulness. The first English sleeping cars made their
                    appearance in 1873, but they were very inferior to the vehicles now employed. In
                    the most approved type at the present time a passage runs along one side of the
                    car, and off it open a number of transverse compartments or berths resembling
                    ships’ cabins, mostly for one person only, and each having a lavatory of its own
                    with cold, and sometimes hot, water laid on. A charge of 7s. 6d. or 10s.,
                    according to distance, is made for each bed, in addition to the first-class
                    fare. In the United States the standard sleeping car has a central alley, and
                    along the sides are two tiers of berths, arranged lengthwise with the car and
                    screened off from the alley by curtains. To some extent cars divided into
                    separate compartments are also in use in that country. On the continent of
                    Europe the typical sleeping car has transverse compartments with two berths, one
                    placed above the other.</p>
               <p>The first railway carriages in England had four wheels with two axles, and this
                    construction is still largely employed, especially for short-distance trains.
                    Later, when increased length became desirable, six wheels with three axles came
                    into use; vehicles of this kind were made about 30 ft. long, and contained four
                    compartments for first-class passengers or five for second or third class,
                    carrying in the latter case fifty persons. Their weight was in the neighbourhood
                    of 10 tons. In both the four-wheeled and the six-wheeled types the axles were
                    free to rise and fall on springs through a limited range, but not to turn with
                    respect to the body of the carriage, though the middle axle of the six-wheeled
                    coach was allowed a certain amount of lateral play. Thus the length of the body
                    was limited, for to increase it involved an increase in the length of the rigid
                    wheel base, which was incom-patible with smooth and safe running on curves. (On
                    the continent of Europe, however, six-wheeled vehicles are to be found much
                    longer than those employed in Great Britain. ) This difficulty is avoided by
                    providing the vehicles with four axles (or six in the case of the largest and
                    heaviest), mounted in pairs (or threes) at each end in a bogie or swivel truck,
                    which being pivoted can move relatively to the body and adapt itself to the
                    curvature of the line. This construction was introduced into England from
                    America about 1874, and has since been extensively adopted, being now indeed
                    standard for main line stock. It soon led to an increase in the length of the
                    vehicles; thus in 1885 the Midland railway had four-wheeled bogie third-class
                    carriages with bodies 43 ft. long, holding seventy persons in seven compartments
                    and weighing nearly 18 tons, and sixwheeled bogie composite carriages, 54 ft.
                    long and weighing 23 tons, which included 3 first-class and 4 third-class
                    compartments, with a cupboard for luggage, and held 58 passengers. The next
                    advance, introduced on the Great Western railway in 1892, was the adoption of
                    corridor carriages having a passage along one side, off which the compartments
                    open, and connected to each other by vestibules, so that it is possible to pass
                    from one end of the train to the other. This arrangement involves a further
                    increase of length and weight. For instance, four-wheeled bogie third-class
                    corridor carriages employed on the Midland railway at the beginning of the 2oth
                    century weighed nearly 25 tons, and had bodies measuring 50 ft.; yet they held
                    only 36 passengers, because not only had the number of compartments been reduced
                    to six, as compared with seven in the somewhat shorter carriage of 1885, by the
                    introduction of a lavatory at each end, but each compartment held only 6
                    persons, instead of 10, owing to the narrowing of its width by the corridor.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0853" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0878.jp2"/>
               <p>It will be seen from these particulars—which are typical of what has happened
                    not only on other British railways, but also on those of other countries—that
                    much more space has to be provided and more weight hauled for each passenger
                    than was formerly the case. Thus, on the Midland railway in 1885, each
                    third-class passenger, supposing the carriage to have its full complement, was
                    allowed 0∙62 ft. of lineal length, and his proportion of the total weight was
                    5∙7 cwt. Less than 20 years later the lineal length allowed each had increased
                    to nearly 1∙4 ft., and the weight to nearly 14 cwt. Passengers in sleeping cars
                    appropriate still more space and weight; in Great Britain some of these cars,
                    though 40 tons in weight and over 65 ft. in length, accommodate only 11
                    sleepers, each of whom thus occupies nearly 6 ft. of the length and requires
                    over 3½ tons of dead weight to be hauled.</p>
               <p>In America the long open double-bogie passenger cars, as originally introduced
                    by Ross Winans on the Baltimore &amp; Ohio railway, arc universally in use.
                    They arc distinguished essentially from the British type of carriage by having
                    in the centre of the body a longitudinal passage, about 2 ft. wide, which runs
                    their whole length, and each car having communication with those on either side
                    of it, the conductor, and also vendors of books, papers and cigars, are enabled
                    to pass right through the train. The cars are entered by steps at each end, and
                    arc provided with lavatories and a supply of iced water. The length is
                    ordinarily about 50 ft., but sometimes 80 or 90 ft. The seats, holding two
                    persons, are placed transversely on each side of the central passage, and have
                    reversible backs, so that passengers can always sit facing the direction in
                    which the train is travelling. Cars of this saloon type have been introduced
                    into England for use on railways which have adopted electric traction, but owing
                    to the narrower loading gauge of British railways it is not usually possible to
                    scat four persons across the width of the car for its whole length, and at the
                    ends the seats have to be placed along the sides of the vehicle. A considerable
                    amount of standing room is then available, and those who have to occupy it have
                    been nicknamed “ straphangers, ” from the fact that they steady themselves
                    against the motion of the train by the aid of leather straps fixed from the roof
                    for that purpose. Cars built almost entirely of steel, in which the proportion
                    of wood is reduced to a minimum, are used on some electric railways, in order to
                    diminish danger from fire, and the same mode of construction is also being
                    adopted for the rolling stock of steam railways.</p>
               <p>End doors opening on end platforms have always been characteristic of American
                    passenger equipment. Their use secures a continuous passage-way through the
                    train, but is attended with some discomfort and risk when the train is in
                    motion. The opening of the doors was apt to cause a disagreeable draught through
                    the car in cold weather, and passengers occasionally fell from the open
                    platform, or were blown from it, when the train was moving. To remedy these
                    defects vestibules were introduced, to enclose the platform with a housing so
                    arranged as to be continuous when the cars are made up into trains, and fitted
                    with side doors for ingress and egress when the trains are standing. A second
                    advantage of the vestibule developed in use, for it was found that the lateral
                    swaying of the cars was diminished by the friction between the vestibule frames.
                    The fundamental American vestibule patent, issued to H. H. Sessions of Chicago
                    in November 1887, covered a housing in combination with a vertical metallic
                    plate frame of the general contour of the central passage-way, which projected
                    slightly beyond the line of the couplings and was held out by horizontal springs
                    top and bottom, being connected with the platform housing by flexible connexions
                    at the top and sides and by sliding plates below. A common form is illustrated
                    in fig. 27. Subsequent improvements on the Sessions patent have resulted in a
                    modified form of vestibule in which the housing is made the full width of the
                    platform, though the contact plate and springs and the flexible connexions
                    remain the same as before. The application of vestibules is practically limited
                    to trains making long</p>
               <p>journeys, as it is an obstruction to the free ingress and egress of passengers
                    on local trains that make frequent stops.</p>
               <p>In the United States the danger of the stoves that used to be employed for
                    heating the interiors of the cars has been realized, and now the most common
                    method is by steam taken from the locomotive boiler and circulated through the
                    train in a line of piping, rendered continuous between the cars by flexible
                    coupling-hose. The same method is finding increased favour in Great Britain, to
                    the supersession of the old hot-water. footwarmers. These in their simplest form
                    are cans filled with water, which is heated by immersing them in a vessel
                    containing boiling water. In some cases, however, they are filled with fused
                    acetate of soda; this salt is solid when cold, but when the can containing it is
                    heated by immersion in hot water it liquefies, and in the process absorbs heat
                    which is given out again on the change of state back to solid. Such cans remain
                    warm longer than those containing only hot water. On electric railways the
                    trains are heated by electric heaters. As to lighting, the oil lamp has been
                    largely displaced by gas and electricity. The former is often a rich oil-gas,
                    stored in steel reservoirs under the coaches at a pressure of six or seven
                    atmospheres, and passed through a reducing valve to the burners; these used to
                    be of the ordinary fish-tail type, but inverted incandescent mantles are coming
                    into increasing use. Gas has the disadvantage that in case of a collision its
                    inflammability may assist any fire that may be started. Electric light is free
                    from this drawback. The current required for it is generated by dynamos driven*
                    from the axles of the coaches. With “set” or “block” trains, that is, trains
                    having their vehicles permanently coupled up, one dynamo may serve for the whole
                    train, but usually a dynamo is provided for each coach, which is then an</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0854" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0879.jp2"/>
               <p>independent unit complete in itself. It is necessary that the voltage of the
                    current shall be constant whatever be the in-crease of the speed of the train,
                    and therefore of the dynamo. In most of the systems that have been proposed this
                    result is attained by electrical regulation; in one, however, a mechanical
                    method is adopted, the dynamo being so hung that it allows the driving belt to
                    slip when the speed of the axle exceeds a certain h*mit, the armature thus being
                    rotated at an approximately constant speed. In all the systems accumulators are
                    required to maintain the light when the train is at rest or is moving too slowly
                    to generate current.</p>
               <p>In all countries passenger trains must vary in weight according to the different
                    services they have to perform; suburban trains, for example, meant to hold as
                    many passengers as possible, and travelling at low speeds, do not weigh so much
                    as long-distance expresses, which include dining and sleeping cars, and on
                    which, from considerations of comfort, more space must be allowed each occupant.
                    The speed at which the journey has to be completed is obviously another
                    important factor, though the increased power of modern locomotives permits
                    trains to be heavier and at the same time to run as fast, and often faster, than
                    was formerly possible, and in consequence the general tendency is towards
                    increased weight as well as increased speed. An ordinary slow suburban train may
                    weigh about 100 tons exclusive of the engine, and may be timed at an inclusive
                    speed, from the beginning to the end of its journey, as low as 12 or 15 m. an
                    hour; while usually the fastest express trains maintaining inclusive speeds of
                    say 45 m. an hour, and made up of the heaviest and strongest rolling stock, do
                    not much exceed 300 tons in any country, and are often less. The inclusive speed
                    over a long journey is of course a different thing from the average running
                    speed, on account of the time consumed in intermediate stops; the fewer the
                    stops the more easily is the inclusive speed increased, —hence the advantage of
                    the non-stop runs of 150 and 200 m. or more which are now performed by several
                    railways in Great Britain, and on which average speeds of 54 or 55 m. per hour
                    are attained between stopping-places. Over shorter distances still more rapid
                    running is occasionally arranged, and in Great Britain, France and the United
                    States there are instances of trains scheduled to maintain an average speed of
                    60 m. an hour or more between stops. Still higher speeds, up to 75 or even 80 m.
                    an hour, are reached, and sustained for shorter or longer distances every day by
                    express trains whose average speed between any two stopping-places is very much
                    less. B ut isolated examples of high speeds do not give the traveller much
                    information as to the train service at his disposal, for on the whole he is
                    better off with a large number of trains all maintaining a good average of speed
                    than with a service mostly consisting of poor trains, but leavened with one or
                    two exceptionally fast ones. If both the number and the speed of the trains be
                    taken into account, Great Britain is generally admitted still to remain well
                    ahead of any other</p>
               <p>country.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Goods Trains. —</hi> The vehicles used for the
                    transportation of goods are known as goods wagons or trucks in Great Britain,
                    and as freight cars in America. The principal types to be found in the United
                    Kingdom and on the continent of Europe are open wagons (the lading often
                    protected from the weather by tarpaulin sheets), mineral wagons, covered or box
                    wagons for cotton, grain, &amp;c., sheep and cattle trucks, &amp;c. The
                    principal types of American freight cars are box cars, gondola cars, coal cars,
                    stock cars, tank cars and refrigerator cars, with, as in other countries,
                    various special cars for special purposes. Most of these terms explain
                    themselves. The gondola or flat car corresponds to the European open wagons and
                    is used to carry goods not liable to be injured by the weather; but in the
                    United States the practice of covering the load with tarpaulins is unknown, and
                    therefore the proportion of box cars is much greater than in Europe. The long
                    hauls in the United States make it specially important that the cars should
                    carry a load in both directions, and so box cars which have carried grain or
                    merchandise one way are filled with wool, coal, coke, ore, timber and other
                    coarse articles for the return journey. On this account it is common to put
                    small end doors in American box cars, through which timber and rails may be
                    loaded.</p>
               <p>The fundamental difference between American freight cars and the goods wagons of
                    Europe and other lands is in carrying capacity. In Great Britain the mineral
                    trucks can ordinarily hold from 8 to 10 tons (long tons, 2240 ℔), and the goods
                    trucks rather less, though there are wagons in use holding 12 or 15 tons, and
                    the specifications agreed to by the railway companies associated in the Railway
                    Clearing House permit private wagon owners (who own about 45% of the wagon stock
                    run on the railways of the United Kingdom) to build also wagons holding 20, 30,
                    40 and 56 tons. On the continent of Europe the average carrying capacity is
                    rather higher; though wagons of less than 10 tons capacity are in use, many of
                    those originally rated at ro tons have been rebuilt to hold 15, and the tendency
                    is towards wagons of 15-20 tons as a standard, with others for special purposes
                    holding 40 or 45 tons.</p>
               <p>The majority of the wagons referred to above are comparatively short, are
                    carried on four wheels, and are often made of wood. American cars, on the other
                    hand, have long bodies mounted on two swivelling bogie-trucks of four wheels
                    each, and are commonly constructed of steel. About 1875 their average capacity
                    differed little from that of British wagons of the present day, but by 1885 it
                    had grown to 20 or 22 short tons (2000 ℔) and now it is probably at least three
                    times that of European wagons. For years the standard freight cars have held
                    60,000 ℔ and now many carry 80,000 ℔ or 100,000 ℔; a few coal cars have even
                    been built to contain 200, 000 ℔. This high carrying capacity has worked in
                    several ways to reduce the cost of transportation. An ordinary British 10-ton
                    wagon often weighs about 6 tons empty, and rarely much less than 5 tons; that
                    is, the ratio of its possible paying load to its tare weight is at the best
                    about 2 to 1. But an American car with a capacity of 100,000 ℔ may weigh only
                    40,000 ℔, and thus the ratio of its capacity to its tare weight is only about 5
                    to 2. Hence less dead weight has to be hauled for each ton of paying load. In
                    addition the increased size of the American freight car has diminished the
                    interest on the first cost and the expenses of maintenance relatively to the
                    work done; it has diminished to some extent the amount of track and yard room
                    required to perform a unit of work; it has diminished journal and rolling
                    friction relatively to the tons hauled, since these elements of train resistance
                    grow relatively less as the load per wheel rises; and finally, it has tended to
                    reduce the labour costs as the train loads have become greater, because no more
                    men are required to handle a heavy train than a light one.</p>
               <p>It is sometimes argued that if these things are true for one country they must
                    be true for another, and that in Great Britain, for example, the use of more
                    capacious cars would bring down the cost of carriage. It may be pointed out,
                    however, that the social and geographical conditions are different in the United
                    Kingdom and the United States, and in each country the methods of carrying goods
                    and passengers have developed in accordance with the requirements of those
                    conditions. In the one country the population is dense, large towns are numerous
                    and close to one another, the greatest distances to be travelled are short, and
                    relatively a large part of the freight to be carried is merchandise and
                    manufactured material consigned in small quantities. In the other country
                    precisely the opposite conditions exist. Under the first set of conditions
                    quickness and flexibility of service are relatively more important than under
                    the second set. Goods therefore are collected and despatched promptly, and, to
                    secure rapid transit, are packed in numerous wagons, each of which goes right
                    through to its destination, with the consequence that, so far as general
                    merchandise is concerned, the weight carried in each is a quarter or less of its
                    capacity. But if full loads cannot be arranged for small wagons, there is
                    obviously no economy in introducing larger ones. On the other hand, where, as in
                    America, the great</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0855" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0880.jp2"/>
               <p>volume of freight is raw material and crude food-stuffs, and the distances are
                    great, a low charge per unit of transportation is more important than any
                    consideration such as quickness of delivery; therefore full car-loads of freight
                    are massed into enormous trains, which run unbroken for distances of perhaps
                    1000 m. to a seaport or distributing centre.</p>
               <p>The weight and speed of goods trains vary enormously according to local
                    conditions, but the following figures, which refer to traffic on the London
                    &amp; North-Western railway between London and Rugby, may be taken as
                    representative of good English practice. Coal trains, excluding the engine,
                    weigh up to 800 or 900 tons, and travel at from 18 to 22 m. an hour; ordinary
                    goods or merchandise trains, weighing 430 tons, travel at from 25 to 30 m. an
                    hour; and quick merchandise trains with limited loads of 300 tons make 35 to 40
                    m. an hour. In the United States mineral and grain trains, running at perhaps 12
                    m. an hour, may weigh up to about 4000 tons, and loads of 2000 tons are common.
                    Merchandise trains run faster and carry less. Their speed must obviously depend
                    greatly on topographical conditions. In the great continental basin there are
                    long lines with easy gradients and curves, while in the Allegheny and Rocky
                    Mountains the gradients are stiff, and the curves numerous and of short radius.
                    Such trains, therefore, range in weight from 600 to 1800 tons or even more, and
                    the journey speeds from terminus to terminus, including stops, vary from 15 to
                    30 m. an hour, the rate of running rising in favourable circumstances to 40 or
                    even 60 m.</p>
               <p>an hour.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Couplers.</hi> —The means by which vehicles are joined
                    together into trains are of two kinds—automatic and non-automatic, the
                    difference between them being that with the former the impact of two vehicles
                    one on the other is sufficient to couple them without any human intervention
                    such as is required with the latter. The common form of non-automatic coupler,
                    used in Great Britain for goods wagons, consists of a chain and hook; the chain
                    hangs loosely from a slot in the draw-bar, which terminates in a hook, and
                    coupling is effected by slipping the chain of one vehicle over the hook of the
                    next. For this opera-tion, or its reverse, a man has to go in between the
                    wagons, unless, as in Great Britain, he is provided with a coupling-stick —that
                    is, a pole having a peculiarly shaped hook at one end by which the chain can be
                    caught and thrown on or off the drawbar hook. This coupling gear is placed
                    centrally between a pair of buffers; formerly these were often left “ dead
                    ’’—that is, consisted of solid prolongations of the frame of the vehicle, but
                    now they are made to work against springs which take up the shocks that occur
                    when the wagons are thrown violently against one another in shunting. In British
                    practice the chains consist of three links, and are of such a length that when
                    fully extended there is a space of a few inches between opposing buffers; this
                    slack facilitates the starting of a heavy train, since the engine is able to
                    start the wagons one by one and the weight of the train is not thrown on it all
                    at once. For passenger trains and occasionally for fast goods trains screw
                    couplings are substituted for the simple chains. In these the central bar which
                    connects the two end links has screw threads cut upon it, and by means of a
                    lever can be turned so as either to shorten the coupling and bring the vehicles
                    together till their buffers are firmly pressed together, or to lengthen it to
                    permit the end link to be lifted off the hook.</p>
               <p>Another form of coupler, which used to be universal in the United States, though
                    it has now been almost entirely superseded by the automatic coupler, was the “
                    link and pin, ” which differed fundamentally from the couplers commonly used in
                    Europe, in the fact that it was a buffer as well as a coupler, no side buffers
                    being fitted. In it the draw-bar, connected through a spring to the frame of the
                    car, had at its outboard end a socket into which one end of a solid link was
                    inserted and secured by a pin. The essential change from the link and pin to the
                    automatic coupler is in the outboard end or head of the draw-bar. The socket
                    that received the link is replaced by a hook, shown at <hi rend="italic">A</hi> in fig. 28, which is usually called the knuckle. This hook swings on the
                    pivot <hi rend="italic">B,</hi> and has an arm which extends backwards,
                    practically at right angles with the working face of the hook, in a cavity in
                    the head, and engages with the locking-pin C. This locking-pin is lifted by a
                    suitable lever which extends to one or both sides of the car; lifting it
                    releases the knuckle, which is then free to swing open, disconnecting the two
                    cars. The knuckle stands open until the coupling is pushed against another
                    coupling, when the two hooks turn on their pivots to the position shown in fig.
                    28, and, the locking-pin dropping into place, the couplers are made fast. This
                    arrangement is only partly automatic, since it often happens that when two cars
                    are brought together to couple the knuckles are closed and must be opened by
                    hand. There are various contrivances by which this may be done by a man standing
                    clear of the cars, but often he must go in between their ends to reach the
                    knuckle.</p>
               <p>This form of automatic coupler has now gained practically universal acceptance
                    in the United States. To effect this result required many years of discussion
                    and experiment. The Master Car Builders’ Association, a great body of mechanical
                    officers organized especially to being about improvement and uniformity in
                    details of construction and operation, expressed its sense of the importance of
                    “ self-coupling ’’ so far back as 1874, but no device of the kind that could be
                    considered useful had then been invented. At that time a member of the
                    Association referred to the disappearance of automatic couplers which had been
                    introduced thirty or forty years before. This body pursued the subject with more
                    or less diligence, and in 1884 laid down the principle that the automatic
                    coupler should be one acting in a vertical plane—that is, the engaging faces
                    should be free to move up and down within a considerable range, in order to
                    provide for the differences in the height of cars. By the fixing of this
                    principle the task of the inventor was considerably simplified. In 1887 a
                    committee reported that the coupler question was the “ knottiest mechanical
                    problem that had ever been presented to the railroad, ” and over 4000 attempted
                    solutions were on record in the United States Patent Office. The committee had
                    not found one that did not possess grave disadvantages, but concluded that the “
                    principle of contact of the surfaces of vertical surfaces embodied in the Janney
                    coupler afforded the best connexion for cars on curves and tangents ”; and in
                    1887 the Association recommended the adoption of a coupler of the Janney type,
                    which, as developed later, is shown in fig. 28. The method of constructing the
                    working faces of this coupler is shown in fig. 29. The principle was patented,
                    but the company owning the patent undertook to permit its free use by railway
                    companies which were members of the Master Car Builders’ Association, and thus
                    threw open the underlying principle to competition. From that time the numerous
                    patents have had reference merely to details. Many different couplers of the
                    Janney type are patented and made by different firms, but the tendency is to
                    equip new cars with one of only four or five standard makes. The adoption of
                    automatic couplers was stimulated in some degree by laws enacted by the various
                    states and by the United States; and the Safety Appliance Act passed by Congress
                    in 1893 made it unlawful for railways to permit to be hauled on their lines
                    after the 1st of January 1898 any car used for interstate commerce that was not
                    equipped with couplers which coupled automatically by impact, and which could be
                    uncoupled without the necessity for men going in between the ends of the cars.
                    The limit was extended to the 1st of August 1900 by the Interstate Commerce
                    Commission, which was given discretion in the matter.</p>

               <p>Automatic couplers resembling the Janney are adopted in a few special cases in
                    Great Britain and other European countries, but the great majority of couplings
                    remain non-automatic. It may be pointed out that the general employment of side
                    buffers in Europe greatly complicates the problem of designing a satis-factory
                    automatic coupling, while to do away with them and substitute the combined
                    buffer-coupling, such as is used in the United States, would entail enormous
                    difficulties in carrying on the traffic during the transition stage.</p>
               <p><hi rend="italic">Brakes. —</hi> In the United States the Safety Appliance Act
                    of 1893 also forbade the railways, after the 1st of January 1898, to run trains
                    which did not contain a “ sufficient number ’’ of cars equipped with continuous
                    brakes to enable the speed to be controlled from the engine. This law, however,
                    did not serve in practice to secure so general a use of power brakes on freight
                    trains as was thought desirable, and another act was passed in 1903 to give the
                    Interstate Commerce Commission authority to prescribe what should be the minimum
                    number of power-braked cars in each train. This minimum was at first fixed at
                    50%, but on and after the 1st of August 1906 it was raised to 75%, with the
                    result that soon after that date practically all the rolling stock of American
                    railways, whether passenger or freight, was provided with compressed air brakes.
                    In the United Kingdom the Regulation of Railways Act 1889 empowered the Board of
                    Trade to require all passenger trains, within a reasonable period, to be fitted
                    with automatic continuous brakes, and now all the passenger stock, with a few
                    trifling exceptions, is provided with either compressed-air or vacuum brakes
                    (see Brake), and sometimes with both. But goods and mineral trains so fitted are
                    rare, and the same is the case on the continent of Europe, where, however, such
                    brakes are generally employed on passenger trains. (H. M. R. )</p>
               <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Intra-Urban Railways</hi></p>
               <p>The great concentration of population in cities during the 19th century brought
                    into existence a class of railways to which the name of intra-urban may be
                    applied. Such lines are primarily intended to supply quick means of passenger
                    communication within the limits of cities, and are to be distinguished on the
                    one hand from surface tram-ways, and on the other from those portions of trunk
                    or other lines which he within city boundaries, although the latter may
                    incidentally do a local or intra-urban business. Intra-urban railways, as
                    compared with ordinary railways, are characterized by shortness of length, great
                    cost per mile, and by a traffic almost exclusively passenger, the burden of
                    which is enormously heavy. For the purpose of connecting the greatest possible
                    number of points of concentrated travel, the first</p>
               <p>railways were laid round the boundaries of areas approximately circular, the
                    theory being that the short walk from the circumference of the circle to any
                    point within it would be no serious detention. It has been found, however, in
                    the case of such circular or belt railways, that the time lost in traversing the
                    circle and in walking from the circumference to the centre is so great that the
                    gain in journey speed over a direct surface tramway or omnibus is entirely lost.
                    Later intra-urban rail-ways in nearly every case have been built, so far as
                    possible, on straight lines, radiating from the business centre or point of
                    maximum congestion of travel to the outer limits of the city; and, while not
                    attempting to serve all the population through the agency of the line, make an
                    effort to serve a portion in the best possible manner—that is, with direct
                    transit.</p>
               <p>The actual beginning of the construction of intra-urban railways was in 1853,
                    when powers were obtained to build a line, 2¼ m. long, from Edgware Road to
                    King’s Cross, in London, from which beginning the Metropolitan and Metropolitan
                    District railways developed. These railways, which in part are operated jointly,
                    were given a circular location, but the shortcomings of this plan soon became
                    apparent. It was found that there was not sufficient traffic to support them as
                    purely intra-urban lines, and they have since been extended into the outskirts
                    of London to reach the suburban traffic.</p>
               <p>The Metropohtan and Metropolitan District railways followed the art of railway:
                    building as it existed at the time they were laid out. Wherever possible the
                    lines were constructed in open cutting, to ensure adequate ventilation; and
                    where this was not possible they were built by a method suggestively named “ cut
                    and cover. ” A trench was first excavated to the proper depth, then the side
                    walls and arched roof of brick were put in place, earth was filled in behind and
                    over the arch, and the surface of the ground restored, either by paving where
                    streets were followed, or by actually being built over with houses where the
                    lines passed under private property. Where the depth to rail-level was too great
                    for cut-and-cover methods, ordinary tunnelling processes were used; and where
                    the trench was too shallow for the arched roof, heavy girders, sometimes of cast
                    iron, bridged it between the side walls, longitudinal arches being turned
                    between them (fig. 30).</p>
               <p>The next development in intra-urban railways was an elevated line in the city of
                    New York. Probably the first suggestion for an elevated railway was made by
                    Colonel Stevens, of Hoboken, New Jersey, as early as 1831, when the whole art of
                    railway construction was in its infancy. He proposed to build an elevated
                    railway on a single line of posts, placed along the curb-line of the street: a
                    suggestion which embodies not only the general plan of an elevated structure,
                    but the most striking feature of it as subsequently built—namely, a railway
                    supported</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0857" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0882.jp2"/>
               <p>by a single row of columns. The first actual work, however, was not begun till
                    1870, when the construction of an iron structure on a single row of columns was
                    undertaken. The superiority, so far as the convenience of passengers is
                    concerned, of an elevated over an underground railway, when both are worked by
                    steam locomotives, and the great economy and rapidity of construction, led to
                    the quick development and extension of this general design. By the year 1878
                    there were four parallel lines in the city of New York, and constructions of the
                    same character had already been projected in Brooklyn and Chicago and, with
                    certain modifications of details, in Berlin. In the year 1894 an elevated
                    railway was built in Liverpool, and in 1900 a similar railway was constructed in
                    Boston, U. S. A., and the construction of a new one undertaken in New York.
                    These elevated railways as a rule follow the lines of streets, and are of two
                    general types. One (fig. 31), the earliest form, consisted of a single row of
                    columns supporting two lines of longitudinal girders carrying the rails, the
                    lateral stability of the structure being obtained by anchoring the feet of the
                    columns to their foundations.</p>
               <p>The other type (fig. 32) has two rows of columns connected at the top by
                    transverse girders, which in turn carry the longitudinal girders that support
                    the railway. In Berlin, on the Stadtbahn—which for a part of its length
                    traverses private property—masonry arches, or earthen embankments between
                    retaining walls, were substituted for the metallic structure</p>
               <p>wherever possible.</p>
               <p>The next great develop-</p>
               <p>ment, marking the third step in the progress of intra-urban railway
                    construction, took place in 1886, when J. H. Greathead ( <hi rend="italic">q.
                        v.</hi> ) began the City &amp; South London railway, ex-tending under
                    the Thames from the Monument to Stockwell, a distance of 3½ m. Its promoters
                    recognized the unsuitability of ordinary steam locomotives for underground
                    railways, and intended to work it by means of a moving cable; but before it was
                    completed, electric traction had developed so far as to be available for use on
                    such lines. Electricity, therefore, and not the cable, was installed (fig. 33).
                    In the details of construction the shield was the novelty. In principle it had
                    been invented by Sir Marc I. Brunel for the construction of the original Thames
                    tunnel, and it was afterwards improved by Beach, of New York, and finally
                    developed by Greathead. (For the details of the shield and method of its
                    operation, see Tunnel. ) By means of the shield Great-head cut a circular hole
                    at a depth ranging from 40 to 80 ft.</p>
               <p>below the surface, with an external diameter of 10 ft. 9 in.; this he lined with
                    cast-iron segments bolted together, giving a</p>
               <p>clear diameter of 10 ft. 2 in. Except at the shafts, which were sunk on proposed
                    station sites, there was no interference with the surface of the streets or with
                    street traffic during construction. Two tunnels were built approximately
                    parallel, each taking a single track. The cross-section of the cars was made to
                    conform approximately to the section of the tunnel, the idea being that each
                    train would act like a piston in a cylinder, expelling in front of it a column
                    of air, to be forced up the station shaft next ahead of the train, and sucking
                    down a similar column through the station shaft just behind. This arrangement
                    was expected to ensure a sufficient change in air to keep such railways properly
                    ventilated, but experience has proved it to be ineffective for the purpose. This
                    method of construction has been used for building other railways in Glasgow and
                    London, and in the latter city alone the “ tube railways ’’ of this character
                    have a length of some 40 m. The later examples of these railways have a diameter
                    ranging from 13 to 15 ft.</p>
               <p>The fourth step in the development of intra-urban railways was to go to the
                    other extreme from the deep tunnel which Greathead introduced. In 1893 the
                    construction was completed in Budapest of an underground railway with a thin,
                    flat roof, consisting of steel beams set close together, with small longitudinal
                    jack arches between them, the street pavement</p>
               <p>resting directly on the roof thus formed (fig. 34). The object was to bring the
                    level of the station platforms as close to the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0858" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0883.jp2"/>
               <p>surface of the street as the height of the car itself would permit; in the case
                    of Budapest the distance is about 9 ft. This principle of construction has since
                    been followed in the construction of the Boston subway, of the Chemin de Fer
                    Métropolitain in Paris, and of the New York underground railway. The Paris line
                    is built with the standard gauge of 4 ft 8½ in., but its tunnels are designedly
                    made of such a small cross-section that ordinary main line stock cannot pass
                    through them.</p>
               <p>The New York underground railway (fig. 35) marks a still further step in
                    advance, in that there are practically two different railways in the same
                    structure. One pair of tracks is used for a local service with stations about
                    one-quarter of a mile apart, following the general plan of operation in vogue on
                    all other intra-urban railways. The other, or central, pair of tracks is for
                    trains making stops at longer distances. Thus there is a differentiation between
                    the long-distance traveller who desires to be carried from one extreme of the
                    city to the other and the short-distance traveller who is going between points
                    at a much less distance.</p>
               <p>To sum up, there are of intra-urban railways two distinct classes: the elevated
                    and the underground. The elevated is used where the traffic is so light as not
                    to warrant the expen-sive underground construction, or where the construction of
                    an elevated line is of no serious detriment to the adjoining property. The
                    underground is used where the congestion of traffic is so great as to demand a
                    railway almost regardless of cost, and where the conditions of surface traffic
                    or of adjoining property are such as to require that the railway shall not
                    obstruct or occupy any ground above the surface.</p>
               <p>Underground railways are of three general types: the one of extreme depth, built
                    by tunne℔ng methods, usually with the shield and without regard to the surface
                    topography, where the stations are put at such depth as to require lifts to
                    carry the passengers from the station platform to the street level. This type
                    has the advantage of economy in first construction, there being the minimum
                    amount of material to be excavated, and no interference during construction with
                    street traffic or subsurface structures; it has, however, the disadvantage of
                    the cost of operation of lifts at the stations. The other extreme type is the
                    shallow construction, where the railway is brought to the <hi rend="underline">minim</hi> um distance below the street level. This system has the
                    advantage of the greatest convenience in operation, no lifts being required,
                    since the distance from the street surface to the station platform is about 12
                    to 15 ft.; it has the dis-advantages, however, of necessitating the tearing up
                    of the street surface during construction, and the readjustment of sewer, water,
                    gas and electric mains and other subsurface structures, and of having the
                    gradients partially dependent on the surface topography. The third type is the
                    intermediate one between those two, followed by the Metropolitan and
                    Metropolitan District railways, in London, where the railway has an arched roof,
                    built usually at a sufficient distance below the surface of the street to permit
                    the other sub-surface structures to lie in the ground above the crown of the
                    arch, and where the station platforms are from 20 to 30 ft. beneath the surface
                    of the street—a depth not sufficient to warrant the introduction of lifts, but
                    enough to be inconvenient.</p>
               <p>In the operation of intra-urban railways, steam locomotives, cables and
                    electricity have severally been tried: the first having been used in the earlier
                    examples of underground lines and in the various elevated systems in the United
                    States. The fouling of the air that results from the steam-engine, owing to the
                    production of carbonic acid gas and of sulphurous fumes and aqueous vapour, is
                    well known, and its use is now practically abandoned for underground working.
                    The cable is slow; and unless development along new lines of compressed air or
                    some sort of chemical engine takes place, electricity will monopolize the field.
                    Electricity is applied</p>
               <p>through a separate locomotive attached to the head of the train, or through
                    motor carriages attached either at one end or at both ends of the train, or by
                    putting a motor on every axle and so utilizing the whole weight of the train for
                    traction, all the motors being under a single control at the head of the train,
                    or at any point of the train for emergency. The distance between stations on
                    intra-urban railways is governed by the density of local traffic and the speed
                    desired to be maintained. As a general rule the interval varies from one-quarter
                    to one-half mile; on the express lines of the New York underground railway, the
                    inter-station interval averages about 1½ m. On steam-worked lines the speed of
                    trains is about 11 to 15 m. per hour, according to the distance between stations
                    Later practice takes advantage of the great increase in power that can be
                    temporarily developed by electric motors during the period of acceleration;
                    this, in proportion to the weight of the train to be hauled, gives results much
                    in advance of those obtained on ordinary steam railways. Since high average
                    speed on a line with frequent stops depends largely on rapidity of acceleration,
                    the tendency in modern equipment is to secure as great an output of power as
                    possible during the accelerating period, with corresponding increase in weight
                    available for adhesion. With a steam locomotive all the power is concen-trated
                    in one machine, and therefore the weight on the drivers available for adhesion
                    is limited. With electricity, power can be applied to as many axles in the train
                    as desired, and so the whole weight of the train, with its load, may be utilized
                    if necessary. Sometimes, as on the Central London railway, the acceleration of
                    gravity is also utilized; the different stations stand, as it were, on the top
                    of a hill, so that outgoing trains are aided at the start by having a slope to
                    run down, while incoming ones are checked by the rising gradient they encounter.</p>
               <p>The cost of intra-urban railways depends not only on the type of construction,
                    but more especially upon local conditions,</p>
               <p>such as the nature of the soil, the presence of subsurface structures, like
                    sewers, water and gas mains, electric conduits, &amp;c.; the necessity of
                    permanent underpinning or temporary supporting of house foundations, the cost of
                    acquiring land passed under or over when street lines are not followed, and, in
                    the case of elevated railways, the cost of acquiring easements of light, air and
                    access, which the courts have held are vested in the abutting property. The cost
                    of building an ordinary two-track elevated railway according to American
                    practice varies from $300,000 to $400,000 a mile, exclusive of equipment,
                    terminals or land damages. The cost of constructing the deep tubular tunnels in
                    London, whose diameter is about 15 ft. exclusive, ĩn like manner, of equipment,
                    terminals or land damages, is about £170,000 to £200,000 a mile. The cost of the
                    Metropolitan and Metropolitan District railways of London varied greatly on
                    account of the variations in construction. The most difficult section—namely,
                    that under Cannon Street— where the abutting buildings had to be underpinned,
                    and a very dense traffic maintained during construction, while a network of
                    sewers and mains was readjusted, cost at the rate of about £1,000,000 a mile.
                    The contract price of the New York under-ground railway, exclusive of the
                    incidentals above mentioned, was $35,000, 000 for 21 m., of which 16 m. are
                    underground and 5 are elevated. The most difficult portion of the road, 4½ m. of
                    four-track line, cost $15,000,000. (W. B. P. )</p>

               <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Light Railways</hi></p>
               <p>The term light railways is somewhat vague and indefinite, and therefore to give
                    a precise definition of its significance is not an easy matter. No adequate
                    definition is to be found even in the British statute-book; for although
                    parliament has on different occasions passed acts dealing with such railways
                    both in Great Britain and Ireland, it has not inserted in any of them a clear
                    and sufficient statement of what it intends shall be understood by the term, as
                    dis-tinguished from an ordinary railway. Since the passing of the Light Railways
                    Act of 1896, which did not apply to Ireland, it is possible to give a formal
                    definition by saying that a light railway is one constructed under the
                    provisions of that act; but it must be noted that the commissioners appointed
                    under that act have authorized many lines which in their physical
                    characteristics are indistinguishable from street tramways constructed under the
                    Tramways Act, and to these the term light railways would certainly not be
                    applied in ordinary parlance. Still, they do differ from ordinary tramways in
                    the important fact that the procedure by which they have been authorized is
                    simpler and cheaper than the methods by which special private acts of parliament
                    have to be obtained for tramway projects. Economy in capital outlay and
                    cheapness in construction is indeed the characteristic generally associated with
                    light railways by the public, and implicitly attached to them by parliament in
                    the act of 1896, and any simplifications of the engineering or mechanical
                    features they may exhibit compared with the standard railways of the country are
                    mainly, if not entirely, due</p>
               <p>to the desire to keep down their expenses.</p>
               <p>The saving of cost is effected in two ways: (1) Instead of having to incur the
                    expenses of a protracted inquiry before parliament, the promoters of a light
                    railway under the act of 1896 make an application to the light railway
                    commissioners, who then hold a local inquiry, to obtain evidence of the
                    usefulness of the proposed railway, and to hear objections to it, and, if they
                    are satisfied, settle the draft order and hand it over to the Board of Trade for
                    confirmation. The Board may reject the order if it thinks the scheme to be of
                    such magnitude or importance that it ought to come under the direct
                    consideration of parliament, or it may modify it in certain respects, or it may
                    remit it to the commissioners for further inquiry. But once the order is
                    confirmed by the Board, with or without modifications, it has effect as if it
                    had been enacted by parliament, and it cannot afterwards be upset on the ground
                    of any alleged irregularity in the proceedings. (2) The second source of economy
                    is to be sought in the reduced cost of actually making the line and of working
                    it when made. Thus the gauge may be narrow, the line single, the rails lighter
                    than those used in standard practice, while deep cuttings and high embankments
                    may be avoided by permitting the curves to be sharper and the gradients steeper:
                    such points conduce to cheapness of construction. Again, low speeds, light
                    stock, less stringent requirements as to continuous brakes, signals,
                    block-working and interlocking, road-crossings, stations, &amp;c., tend to
                    cheapness in working. On the lines actually authorized by the Board of Trade
                    under the 1896 act the normal minimum radius of the curves has been fixed at
                    about 600 ft.; when a still smaller radius has been necessary, the speed has
                    been reduced to 10 m. an hour and a guard-rail insisted on inside the curve.
                    Again, the speed has been restricted to 20 m. an hour on long inclines with
                    gradients steeper than 1 in 50, and also on a Une which had scarcely any
                    straight portions and in which there were many curves of 600 ft. radius and
                    gradients of 1 in 50. In the case of a line of 2½ ft. gauge, with a ruling
                    gradient of 1 in 40, a maximum speed of 15 m. an hour and a minimum radius of
                    curve of 300 ft. have been prescribed. Curves of still smaller radius have
                    entailed a maximum speed of 10 m. an hour. It must be understood that a railway
                    described as “ light ” is not necessarily built of narrower gauge than the
                    standard. Many Unes, indeed, have been designed on the normal 4 ft. 8½ in.
                    gauge, and laid with rails weighing from 50 to 70 ℔ per yard; a flat-footed 60 ℔
                    rail, with the axle load limited to 14 tons, has the advantage for such lines
                    that it permits the employment of a proportion of the locomotives used on main
                    lines. The orders actually granted have allowed 50 ℔, 56 ℔, 60 ℔ and 70 ℔ rails,
                    with corresponding axle loads of 10, 12, 14 and 16 tons. On a line of 2 ft.
                    gauge, rails of 40 lb have been sanctioned. In regard to fencing and precautions
                    at level-crossings, less rigid requirements may be enforced than with standard
                    railways; and in some cases where trains arc likely to be few, it has been
                    provided that the normal position of the gates at crossings shall be across the
                    line. Again, if the speed is low and the trains infrequent, the signalling
                    arrangements may be of a very simple and inexpensive kind, or even dispensed
                    with altogether. It should be mentioned that the act provided that the Treasury
                    might advance a portion of the money required for a line in cases where the
                    council of any county, borough or district had agreed to do the same, and might
                    also make a special advance in aid of a light railway which was certified by the
                    Board of Agriculture to be beneficial to agriculture in any cultivated district,
                    or by the Board of Trade to furnish a means of communication between a
                    fishing-harbour and a market in a district where it would not be constructed
                    without special assistance from the state.</p>
               <p>As a general classification the commissioners have divided the schemes that have
                    come before them into three classes: (A) those which like ordinary railways take
                    their own line across country; (B) those in connexion with which it is proposed
                    to use the public roads conjointly with the ordinary road traffic; and (Neutral)
                    which includes inclined railways worked with a rope, and lines which possess the
                    conditions of A and B in about equal porportions.</p>
               <p>The Light Railways Act 1896 was to remain in force only until the end of 1901
                    unless continued by parliament, but it was continued year by year under the
                    Expiring Laws Continuance Act. In 1901 the president of the Board of Trade
                    intro-duccd a bill to continue the act until 1906, and to amend it so as to make
                    it authorize the construction of a light railway on any highway, the object
                    being to abolish the restriction that a light railway should run into the area
                    of at least two local authorities; but it was not proceeded with. Towards the
                    end of 1901 a departmental committee of the Board of Trade was formed to
                    consider the Light Railways Act, and in 1902 the president of the Board of Trade
                    (Mr Gerald Balfour) stated that as a result of the deliberations of this
                    committee, a new bill had been drafted which he thought would go very far to
                    meet all the reasonable objections that had been urged against the present
                    powers of the local authorities. This bill, however, was not brought forward. In
                    July 1903, Lord Wolverton, on behalf of the Board of Trade, introduced a bill to
                    continue and amend the Light Railways Act. It provided that the powers of the
                    light railway commissioners should continue until determined by parliament, and
                    also provided, <hi rend="italic">inter alia,</hi> that in cases where the
                    Board of Trade thought, under section (9) subsection (3) of the original act,
                    that a proposal should be submitted to parliament, the Board of Trade itself
                    might submit the proposals to parliament by bringing in a bill for the
                    confirmation of the light railway order, with a special report upon it.
                    Opposition on petition could be heard before a select committee or a joint
                    committee as in the case of private bills. The bill was withdrawn on the 11th of
                    August 1903, Lord Morley appealing to the Board of Trade to bring in a more
                    comprehensive measure to amend the unsatisfactory state of legislation in
                    relation to tramways and light railways. In 1904 the president of the Board of
                    Trade brought in a bill on practically the same lines as the amending bill of
                    1903. It reached second reading but was not proceeded with. Similar amending
                    bills were introduced in the 1905 and 1906 sessions, but were withdrawn. During
                    the first ten years after the act came into force 545 applications for orders
                    were received, 313 orders were made, and 282 orders were confirmed. The orders
                    confirmed were for 1731 m., involving an estimated capital expenditure of
                    £12,770,384. At the end of 1906 only 500 m. had been opened for traffic, and the
                    mileage of lines</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0860" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0885.jp2"/>
               <p>opened was much less in proportion to the mileage sanctioned in the cases of
                    lines constructed on their own land than in the case of lines more of the nature
                    of tramways. (In other countries where the mileage of main lines of railways in
                    pro-portion to area and population is roughly the same as in the United Kingdom,
                    the mileage of light railways already constructed is considerable, while many
                    additional lines are under construction. At the end of 1903 there were 6150 m.
                    working in France, costing on an average £4500 per mile, earning £275 per mile
                    per annum; 3730 miles in Prussia costing £4180 per mile, earning £310 per mile
                    per annum; 1430 m. in Belgium at £3400 per mile, earning £320 per mile per
                    annum. ) The average cost per mile in Great Britain on the basis of the
                    prescribed estimates is £5860, but this figure does not include the cost of
                    equipment and does not cover the whole cost of construction. According to the
                    light railway commissioners, experience satisfied them <hi rend="italic">(a)</hi> that light railways were much needed in many parts of the country and that
                    many of the lines proposed, but not constructed, were in fact necessary to admit
                    of the progress, and even the maintenance, of existing trade interests; and <hi
                        rend="italic"> (b)</hi> that improved means of access were requisite to
                    assist in retaining the population on the land, to counteract the remoteness of
                    rural districts, and also, in the neighbourhood of industrial centres, to cope
                    with the difficulties as to housing and the supply of labour. They pointed out
                    that while during the first five years the act was in force there were 315
                    applications for orders, during the second five years there were only 142
                    applications, and that proposals for new lines had become less numerous owing to
                    the various difficulties in carrying them to a successful completion and to the
                    difficulty of raising the necessary capital even when part of it was provided
                    with the aid of the state and of the local authorities. They ex-pressed the
                    opinion that an improvement could be effected enabling the construction of many
                    much-needed lines by an amendment of some of the provisions of the Light
                    Railways Act, and by a reconsideration of the conditions under which financial
                    or other assistance should be granted to such lines by the state and by local
                    authorities.</p>
               <p>The so-called light railways in the United States and the British colonies have
                    been made under the conditions peculiar to new countries. Their primary object
                    being the development and peopling of the land, they have naturally been made as
                    cheaply as possible; and as in such cases the cost of the land is
                    inconsiderable, economy has been sought by the use of lighter and rougher
                    permanent way, plant, rolling stock, &amp;c. Such railways are not “ light
                    ’’ in the technical sense of having been made under enactments intended to
                    secure permanent lowness of cost as compared with standard lines. On the
                    continent of Europe many countries have encouraged railways which are light in
                    that sense. France began to move in this direction in 1865, and has formulated
                    elaborate provisions for their construction and regulation. Italy did the same
                    in its laws in 1873, 1879, 1881, 1887 and 1889; and Germany fostered enterprise
                    of this kind by the imperial edicts of 1875, 1878 and 1892. Holland, Hungary and
                    Switzerland were all early in the field; and Belgium has succeeded, through the
                    in-strumentality of the semi-official Société Nationale de Chemins de Fer
                    Vicinaux, started in 1885, in developing one of the most complete systems of
                    rural railway transport in the world.</p>
               <p>In France the lines which best correspond to British light railways are called <hi rend="italic">Chemins de fer d'intérêt local.</hi> These are regulated
                    by a decree No. 11, 264 of 6th August 1881, which the Ministry of Public Works
                    is charged to carry out. The model “ form of regulation ” lays down the scales
                    of the drawings and the information to be shown thereon. For the first
                    installation a single line is prescribed, but the <hi rend="italic">concessionaire</hi> must provide space and be prepared to double when
                    required. The gauge may be either 1∙44 metres (4 ft. 8∙7 in. ), or 1 metre (3
                    ft. 3∙37 in. ), or ∙75 metre (2 ft. 5∙5 in. ). The radius of curves for the 1∙44
                    m. gauge must not be less than 250 metres, 100 metres for the 1 m. gauge and 50
                    metres for the ∙75 m. gauge. A straight length of not less than 60 metres for
                    the largest gauge and 40 metres for the smallest must be made between two curves
                    having opposite directions. Except in special cases, gradients must not exceed 3
                    in 100; and between gradients in the opposite sense there must be not less than
                    60 metres of level for 1∙44 m. and 40 metres for 1 m. and ∙75 m. gauges. The
                    position of stations and stopping-places is regulated by the council of the
                    department. The undertaking, once approved, is regarded as a work of public
                    utility, and the undertakers are invested with all the rights that a public
                    department would have in the case of the carrying out of public works. At the
                    end of the period of the concession the <hi rend="italic">department</hi> comes into possession of the road and all its fixed appurtenances, and in the
                    last five years of the period the <hi rend="italic">department</hi> has the
                    right to enter into possession of the line, and apply the revenue to putting it
                    into a thorough state of repair. It has also the right to purchase the
                    under-taking at the end of the first fifteen years, the net profits of the
                    preceding seven years to govern the calculation of the purchase price. The
                    maximum 1st, 2nd and 3rd class passenger fares are, per kilometre, ∙o67 f. (∙6d.
                    ), ·050 f. (∙455d. ) and ·037 f. (·34d. ) respectively, when the trains are run
                    at <hi rend="italic">grande vitesse,</hi> the fares including 30 kilogrammes
                    weight of personal baggage.</p>
               <p>In Belgium a public company under government control (“ Société Nationale de
                    Chemins de Fer Vicinaux ”) does all that in France forms the responsibility of
                    the Ministry of the Interior and of the prefect of the department. Over an
                    average of years it appears that 27% of the capital cost was found by the state,
                    28% by the province, 40∙9 % by the communes and 4∙1% by private individuals. At
                    the end of 1908 there were 2085 m. in operation, and the total mileage
                    authorized was 2603, while the construction of a considerable further mileage
                    was under consideration. As far as possible, these railways are laid beside
                    roads, in preference to independent formation; the permanent way costs £977 per
                    mile in the former as against £793 in the latter. If laid in paving, the price
                    varies between £1108 and £2266 per mile. Through villages, and where roads have
                    to be crossed, the line is of the usual tramway type. The line is of I metre
                    gauge, with steel rails weighing 21½ kilos (42 ℔) per yard, In the towns a
                    deeper rail is used, weighing about 60 ℔ per yard. In three lines of the
                    Vicinaux system, in the aggregate 45 m. in length, the sharpest curves are 30
                    metres, 35 metres and 40 metres respectively. There are gradients of 1 in 20 and
                    1 in 25. The speed is limited to 30 kilometres (about 18 m. ) in the country and
                    6 m. per hour in towns and through villages.</p>
               <p>In Italy many railways which otherwise fulfil the conditions of a light railway
                    are constructed with a gauge of 4 ft. 8½ in. The weights are governed by what
                    the railway has to carry and the speed. Light locomotives, light rails and light
                    rolling stock are employed. There are no bridges, except where watercourses
                    occur. Cuttings are reduced to a minimum; and where the roads are sufficiently
                    wide, the rails are laid on the margins. The advantage of uniformity of gauge is
                    in the use of trucks for goods which belong to the rolling stock of the main
                    lines. In Italy these railways are called “ economic railways, ” and are divided
                    into five types. Types I., II. and III. are of 4 ft. 8½ in. gauge, type IV. of
                    0·95 m. and type V. of 0·70 m.; but as there is no example of type V., the
                    classification is practically one of 1∙445 m. (4 ft. 8½ in. ) and one of 0·95 (3
                    ft. 0∙5 in. ). The chief difference between the first three types lies in the
                    weight of rails and rolling stock and in the radius of the curves. The real
                    light railway of Italy is that of type IV.: gauge, 0·95 m. (3 ft. 0·5 in. );
                    weight of rails, 12 (26∙45 ℔) to 20 (44 ℔) kilos; mean load per axle, 6 tons;
                    minimum curve, 70 m. (229 ft. 2∙6 in. ) radius; width of formation, 3∙50 m. (11
                    ft. 5∙5 in. ); top width of ballast, 2·10 m. (6 ft. 10∙7 in. ); depth of ballast
                    under sleepers, 0∙10 m. (3 ft. 9∙5 in. ); maximum gradient, I in 50; length of
                    sleepers, 1∙70 m. (5 ft. 6∙92 in. ); width between parapets and width of
                    tunnels, 1 m. over width of carriage; height of tunnels, 5 m. (16 ft. 4·85 in.
                    ); locomotives, maximum weight per axle 6 tons, rigid wheel base 1∙80 m. (5 ft.
                    10∙86 in. ), diameter of driving-wheels 1 m. (3 ft. 3∙37 in. ).</p>
               <p>In Germany the use of light railways <hi rend="italic">(Klein-bahnen)</hi> has
                    made great strides. The gauges in use vary considerably between 4 ft. 8½ in.,
                    the standard national gauge, and 1 ft. 11¾ in., which appears to be the smallest
                    in use. They are under the control of the Post and Telegraph department, the
                    state issuing loans to encourage the undertakings; the authorities in the
                    provinces and communes also give support in various ways, and under various
                    conditions, to public bodies or private persons who desire to promote or embark
                    in the industry. These conditions, as well as the degree of control over the
                    construction and working of the lines, are left to the regulation of the
                    provincial governments. Similarly, the same authorities decide for themselves
                    the conditions under which the public roads may be used, and the precautions for
                    public safety, all subject to the confirmation of the imperial government.</p>
               <p>What are known as “ portable railways ” should be included in the same category
                    as light railways. With a 24 in. gauge, lines of a portable kind can be made
                    very handily and the cost is very much less than that of a permanently
                    constructed light railway. The simplicity is great; they can be quickly mounted
                    and dismounted; the correct gauge can be perfectly maintained; the sections of
                    rails and</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb11-22-r01-0861" facs="encyclopaediabri22chisrich_0886.jp2"/>
               <p>sleepers (which are of iron) are very portable, and skilled labour is not
                    required to lay or to take them up; the making of a “ turn-out ” is easy, by
                    taking out a 15 ft. section of the way and substituting a section with points
                    and crossings. The safe load per wheel varies between 12 cwt. on a 10 in. 16 lb
                    wheel and 40 cwt. on an 18 in. 56 lb wheel. The rolling stock is constructed
                    either for farm produce or heavy minerals, the latter holding 10 to 27 cub. ft.
                    For timber, 4 or 5 ft. bogies can be used. A useful wagon for agricultural
                    transport on a 24 in. gauge line is 16 ft. long by 5 ft. wide; it weighs 72 cwt.
                    and costs £30. A portable line of this kind will have 20 lb steel rails and 2112
                    steel sleepers—4 ft. 6 in. long—to a mile, laid 2 ft. 6 in. apart centre to
                    centre. The total cost per mile of such a line, including all bolts, nuts,
                    fish-plates and fastenings, ready for laying, delivered in the United Kingdom,
                    is under £500 a mile.</p>
