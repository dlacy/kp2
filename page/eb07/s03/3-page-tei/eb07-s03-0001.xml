            <p>SHIP-BUILDING CONTD James II., from having so long and so gloriously filled the office of Lord High
                Admiral while Duke of York, was perfectly aware of the requirements of the navy ;
                and during his short reign he paid great attention to increasing its efficiency. He
                also especially directed inquiries into the question of the durability of timber for
                the construction of it, and carefully accumulated both materials and stores for its
                maintenance. It is not a little curious that it was probably the attention which the
                monarchs of the line of Stuart had bestowed on the naval service, which enabled it
                so triumphantly to resist the persevering attempts of Louis XIV. to recover for them
                the throne of their ancestors.</p>
            <p>Though England was at the Revolution possessed of an efficient fleet, manned by
                experienced seamen, who had all the confidence arising from a series of naval
                triumphs, it must be remembered that for a long period no opposition to her naval
                superiority had been anticipated from any other power than Holland ; and
                consequently the fleets of England were composed of ships which had many of them
                been built to adapt them to this service, for which small dimensions and light
                draughts of water were essential qualifications, on account of the shoalness of the
                Dutch coast.</p>
            <p>William was too cautious a monarch to have neglected so important a means of national
                defence, as was the navy when engaged with such an ambitious and energetic opponent
                as Louis XIV. ; and we find that the naval force was considerably increased, both
                numerically and. in dimensions, during his reign. But the triumphs of our armies
                under Marlborough having for a time diverted the attention of the nation from naval
                affairs, it fell into decay during the reign of his successor.</p>
            <p>When Louis XIV. determined to dispute with England for the sovereignty of the seas,
                he was not only without a navy, but without the means of forming one. The military
                and commercial marine of France had ceased to exist. The sanguine temperament of the
                monarch, and the wisdom of his minister Colbert, removed all obstacles ; commerce
                began to flourish on the quays, merchant-vessels to crowd the ports ; dock-yards,
                harbours, and shipping appeared simultaneously to start into existence ; and the
                nation, which almost for centuries had been essentially military, felt constrained
                to turn its energies to commerce and to the sea. A navy which in. 1661 consisted of
                some four or five small vessels, in little more than ten years bearded and baffled
                the combined fleets of Holland and of Spain, and asserted the sovereignty of the
                Mediterranean. In 1681 her fleets consisted of 115 line-of-battle ships, manned by
                36,440 men, with 179 smaller ships, the crews of which amounted to 3037 men ; and in
                1690 a fleet of eighty-four vessels of war, out of which three were of a hundred
                guns and upwards, and ten others were above eighty-four guns, with twenty-two
                fire-ships, was cruizing in the British seas. It is true that these mighty armaments
                failed in fulfilling the ambitious designs of Louis. But the severity of the
                struggle, which at length ended in the annihilation of his hopes, and in our
                triumphant assertion of our naval superiority, must always serve as an example of
                the danger we may incur by too great confidence in that superiority.</p>
            <p>We have the following comparison between the French and British ships of about this
                period, from an official contemporary paper, by a gentleman of the name of Gibson :
                “ Our guns being for the most part shorter, are made to carry more shott than a
                French gunn of like weight, therefore the French guns reach further, and ours make a
                bigger hole. By this the French has the advantage to fight at a distance, and wee
                yard-arm to yard-arm. The like advantage wee have over them in shipping; although
                they are broader and carry a better saile, our sides are thicker, and better able to
                receive their shott ; by this they are more subject to be sunk by gunn shott than
                wee."</p>
            <p>The paper also complains much of the injudicious management of our shipping, by which
                it says, “ many a fast sayling shipp have come to loose that property, by being
                over-masted, over-rigged, over-gunned (as the Constant Warwick, from twenty-six
                gunns, and an incomparable sayler, to forty-six gunns and a slugg), over-manned
                (vide all the old shipps built in the parliament time now left), over-built (vide
                the Ruby and Assurance), and haveing great tafferills, gallarys, &amp;c., to the
                making many formerly a stiff, now a tender-sided shipp, bringing thereby their head
                and tuck to lye too low in the water, and by it takeing away their former good
                property in steering, sayling, &amp;c. The French by this defect of ours make wart
                with the sword (by sending no small shipps of warr to sea, but clean), and wee, by
                cruseing in fleetes, or single shipps foule, with bare threates.”</p>
            <p>Charnock draws some curious parallels between the state of the two navies of France
                and England during the earlier half of the eighteenth century, which may be summed
                up in a few words. That when the French took an English ship, it was seldom admitted
                into their navy ; or, if admitted, it was only at a much lower rating, as, for
                instance, the Pembroke, a sixty-four in our service, became a fifty-gun ship in
                theirs. That in cases when an English fleet was in chase of a French fleet, it was
                ships which were British built which fell into our possession ; but that almost on
                every occasion the French ships could evade ours. That the losses sustained in the
                French navy by foundering at sea, or by wrecks, were principally those ships which
                had been taken from us. That, on the contrary, the favourite ships in our fleets
                were those which had been taken from the French, and the instances in which French
                ships in our service were ever recovered possession of by them were extremely rare ;
                we as far excelling them in all that related to the manœuvres and management of
                ships as they did us in designing them.</p>
            <p>In consequence of the little attention bestowed upon the navy during the
                land-triumphs of Marlborough, it was found absolutely necessary, at the commencement
                of the reign of George I. that vigorous measures should be taken to re- establish
                it. Much pains were bestowed during this and the succeeding reign of George II. to
                improve its efficiency. The dimensions and the armament of the ships composing it
                underwent frequent revisals, and many valuable accessory improvements were made.
                Still it was evident that the perfect seamanship of the officers, and the undaunted
                valour of their crews, were frequently rendered nugatory by the superior qualities
                of the ships of their opponents, and the nation reaped little more than empty honour
                from the contests in which she engaged ; the heavy sailers of England being unable
                to prevent her colonies and her commerce from suffering severely from the attacks of
                the light squadrons of her enemies. The naval commanders of England were constant in
                their complaints of the comparative inferiority in speed, in stability, and in
                readiness of manoeuvring, of the ships under their command.</p>
            <p>In a letter from Sir George (afterwards Lord) Rodney, dated the 31st May 1780, to Mr
                Stephens, the secretary of the Admiralty, is a passage which proves in a remarkable
                degree the truth of the above statement. “Nothing could induce them (the French
                fleet), to risk a general action, though it was in their power daily. They made, at
                different times, motions which indicated a desire of engaging, but their resolution
                failed them when they drew near ; and as they sailed far better than his majesty’s
                fleet, they with ease could gain what distance they pleased to windward.”</p>
            <p>One great cause of the inferiority of our ships arose from the practice which
                prevailed during the first half of the eighteenth century, through a mistaken idea
                of economy, of “ rebuilding” old ships, so that, in fact, the forms and dimensions
                of the previous century passed down in many</p>
