<p><span class="font0">and conducted him to the capitol; the people followed, crowned with garlands of flowers; and after having returned thanks to the gods, waited upon him to his palace. There remained now but one obſtacle to&nbsp;his ambition, which was Antony, whom lie reſolved to&nbsp;remove, and for that purpoſe began to render his character as contemptible as he poſſibly could at Rome.&nbsp;In fact, Antony’s conduct did not a little contribute&nbsp;to promote the endeavours of his ambitions partner in&nbsp;the ſtate. He had marched againſt the Parthians with&nbsp;a prodigious army; but was forced to return with the&nbsp;loſs of the fourth part of his forces, and all his baggage *. This extremely diminiſhed his reputation;&nbsp;but his making a triumphal entry into Alexandria ſoon&nbsp;after, entirely diſguſted the citizens of Rome. However, Antony ſeemed quite regardleſs of their reſentment: totally diſregarding the buſineſs of the ſtate, he&nbsp;ſpent whole days and nights in the company of Cleopatra, who ſtudied every art to increaſe his paſſion, and&nbsp;vary his entertainments. Not contented with ſharing&nbsp;in her company all the delights which Egypt could&nbsp;afford, Antony was reſolved to enlarge his ſphere of&nbsp;luxury, by granting her many of thoſe kingdoms which&nbsp;belonged to the Roman empire. He gave her all&nbsp;Phoenicia, Celo-Syria, and Cyprus; with a great part&nbsp;of Cilicia, Arabia, and Judea; gifts which he had no</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">-right to beſtow, but which he pretended to grant in imitation of Hercules. This complication of vice and&nbsp;ſolly at length totally exaſperated the Romans ; and&nbsp;Octavianus, willing to take advantage of their reſentment, took care to exaggerate aſt his defects. At&nbsp;'length, when he found the people fuſſiciently irritated&nbsp;againſt him, he reſolved to ſend Octavia, who was then&nbsp;at Rome, to Antony, as if with a view of reclaiming&nbsp;Tier huſhand; but, in fact, to furniſh a ſufficient pretext&nbsp;of declaring war againſt him, a8 he knew ſhe would be&nbsp;diſmiſſed with contempt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Antony was now in the city of Leucopolis, revelling with his inſidious paramour, when he heard that Octavia was at Athens, upon her journey to viſit him. This&nbsp;•was very unwelcome news to him as well as to Cleopatra ; who, fearing the charms of her rival, endeavoured&nbsp;, to convince Antony of the ſtrength of her paſſion. He&nbsp;frequently caught her in tears, which ſhe ſeemed as if&nbsp;willing to hide; and often intreated her to tell him the&nbsp;cauſe, which ſhe ſeemed willing to ſuppreſs. Theſe artifices, together with the ceaſeleſs flattery and importunity of her creatures, prevailed ſo much upon Antony’s&nbsp;weakneſs, that he commanded Octavia to return home&nbsp;without ſeeing her, and attached himſelf ſtill more cloſely to Cleopatra than before. His ridiculous paſſion&nbsp;now began to have no bounds. He reſolved to own&nbsp;her ſor his wiſe, and entirely to repudiate Octavia. He&nbsp;accordingly aſſembled the people of Alexandria in the&nbsp;public theatre, where was raiſed an alcove of ſilver, under which were placed two thrones of gold, one for&nbsp;himſelſ and the other for Cleopatra. There he ſeated&nbsp;himſelf, dreſſed like Bacchus, while .Cleopatra ſat beſide&nbsp;him clothed in the ornaments and attributes of lſis, the&nbsp;principal deity of the Egyptians. On that occaſion he&nbsp;declared her queen of all the countries which hc had&nbsp;already beſtowed uponher; while he aſſociated Gæfa-rio, her ſon by Cæſar, as her partner in the government.&nbsp;To the two children which he had by her himſelf he&nbsp;gave the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">king of kings,</span><span class="font0"> with very </span><span class="font1">extenſive </span><span class="font0">do</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">minions ; and, to crown his abſurdities, he ſent </span><span class="font1">a ml· </span><span class="font0">nute account of his proceedings to the two conſuls at&nbsp;Rome. It was now neceſſary to act up to his imaginary dignity ; new Luxuries and pageantries were now&nbsp;therefore ſtudied, and new marks of profuſion found&nbsp;out : not leſs than 6o&gt;oool.∙of our money were laviſhed&nbsp;upon one ſingle entertainment; it is ſaid, upon this occaſion, that Cleopatra diſſolved a pearl of great value in&nbsp;•vinegar, and drank it off. But wo are told of one circumſtance that might well repreſs their delights, and&nbsp;teach mankind to reliſh the beverage of virtue, however ſimple, above their greateſt luxuries. He was ſuſpicious of being poiſoned in every meal ; he feared&nbsp;Gleopatra, whom he ſo much loved, and would eat nothing without having it previouſly taſted by one of his&nbsp;attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time Octavianus had now a ſufficient pretext for declaring war; and informed the ſenate of&nbsp;his intentions. However, he deferred the execution of&nbsp;his deſign for a while, being then employed in quelling&nbsp;an inſurrection of the Illyrians. The following year&nbsp;was chiefly taken up in preparations againſt Antony,&nbsp;who, perceiving his deſign, remonſtrated to the ſenate,&nbsp;that he had many cauſes of complaint againſt his colleague, who had ſeized upon Sicily without offering him&nbsp;a ſhare ; alleging that he had alſo diſpoſſeſſed Lepidus,&nbsp;and kept to himſelf the province he had commanded ;&nbsp;and that he had divided all Italy among his own ſoldiers, leaving nothing to recompenſe thoſe in Aſia. To&nbsp;this complaint Octavianus was contented to make a ſar-caſtic anſwer ; implying, that it was abſurd to complain&nbsp;of his diſtribution of a few trifling diſtricts in Italy,&nbsp;when Antony having conquered Parthia, he might now&nbsp;reward his ſoldiers with cities and provinces. The ſar-caſm upon Antony’s misfortunes in Parthia ſo provoked him, that he ordered Canidius, who commanded his&nbsp;army, to march without intermiſſion into Europe ;&nbsp;while he and Cleopatra followed to Samos, in order to&nbsp;prepare for carrying on the war with vigour. When&nbsp;arrived there, it was ridiculous enough to behold the&nbsp;odd mixture of preparations for pleaſure and for war.&nbsp;Gn one ſide all the kings and princes from Europe to&nbsp;the Euxine ſea had orders to ſend him thither ſupplies&nbsp;both of men, proviſions, and arms ; on the other lide,&nbsp;all the comedians, dancers, buffoons, and muſicians of&nbsp;Greece, were ordered to attend him. Thus, frequently, when a ſhip was thought to arrive laden with ſoldiers, arms, and ammunition, it was found only filled&nbsp;with players and theatrical machinery. When news&nbsp;was expected of the approach of an army, meſſengers&nbsp;only arrived with tidings of a freſh quantity of veniſon.&nbsp;The kings who attended him endeavoured to gain hie&nbsp;favour more by their entertainments than their warlike&nbsp;preparations ; the provinces ſtrove rather to pleaſe him&nbsp;by ſacriſicing to his divinity, than by their alacrity in&nbsp;his defence ; ſo that ſome were heard to ſay, “ What&nbsp;rejoicings would not this man make for a victory,&nbsp;when he thus triumphs at the eve of a dangerous war!”&nbsp;In ſhort, his beſt friends now began to forſake his intereſts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His delay at Samos, and afterwards at Athens, where he carried Cleopatra to receive new honours, was extremely favourable to the arms of Octavianus. This&nbsp;general was at firſt ſcarcely in a diſpoſition to oppoſe&nbsp;him, had </span><span class="font1">he </span><span class="font0">gone into Italy ; but </span><span class="font1">hc </span><span class="font0">ſoon found time</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
