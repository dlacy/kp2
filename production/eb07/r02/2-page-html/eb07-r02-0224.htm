<p><span class="font0">ROSCIUS, Q, a celebrated comic actor, who is spoken of in terms of the highest commendation by Cicero. The exact period of his birth is unknown ; but he must have been&nbsp;somewhat older than Cicero (born b. c. 106), as he had already earned a high reputation before the death of Sulla,&nbsp;B. c. 78. His subsequent career was said to have been&nbsp;predicted by a strange occurrence whilst he was still a&nbsp;child. His early years were spent at Solonium, near Lanuvium ; and whilst he was sleeping in his cradle, a serpent&nbsp;entwined itself round his body without injuring him. This&nbsp;circumstance in the life of the actor was afterwards represented by the artist Praxiteles, and celebrated by the poet&nbsp;Archias. The orator afterwards remarks, that it seems ridiculous that the gods should predict the future fate of an&nbsp;actor, whilst they neglected statesmen and heroes, whom&nbsp;the world admired. Of his education we know nothing,&nbsp;except that he and Æsopus the tragic actor used to attend&nbsp;the forum when Hortensius the orator pleaded, that they&nbsp;might imitate on the stage what they admired in him. He&nbsp;had a particular squint of the eye, hut this was of course&nbsp;concealed by the mask he wore. His private character was&nbsp;highly respected, and Cicero remarked that he was such&nbsp;an artist that he seemed the only one fit to appear upon&nbsp;the stage, and yet so excellent a man tllat it was beneath&nbsp;his dignity, which he thought worthy of the senate. He&nbsp;used to contend with Cicero which of them could represent the same sentiment in the greatest variety of ways,&nbsp;he by acting, and Cicero by his eloquence. So high an opinion did he entertain of his profession, that he wrote a work&nbsp;comparing it with oratory. He gave lessons in elocution,&nbsp;and used to say that he never had a pupil whom he could&nbsp;altogether approve of. His gains as an actor are variously&nbsp;stated, by Macrobius at 1000 denarii (L.32.5s. 10d.) a day ;&nbsp;and by Cicero at 600,000 sesterces for ten years (L.48,434.&nbsp;10s.), which would make it somewhat less than L.5000 a&nbsp;year ; but for the last ten years he had refused to receive&nbsp;this pension from the Roman people. He had a dispute&nbsp;with one Fannius Chcerea respecting a slave, of whom they&nbsp;were joint owners, and he was defended by Cicero ; but at&nbsp;what time this took place we have no means of judging.&nbsp;Only a part of the speech has been preserved. He died a&nbsp;little before the time (about b. c. 61) that Cicero delivered&nbsp;his oration in defence of Archias.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROSCOE, William, a distinguished writer, was born at Liverpool on the 8th of March 1753. He was the only&nbsp;son of William Roscoe, who then kept a public-house called the Bowling Green, and who is described as a man below the middle stature, but of remarkable bodily strength&nbsp;and activity ; of much vivacity of temperament, and greatly&nbsp;attached to field-sports and other amusements, for which&nbsp;his son never acquired any relish. He had also an only&nbsp;daughter, who became the wife of Daniel Daulby, Esq.&nbsp;With the charge of his public-house he united that of a&nbsp;market-garden ; but during his declining age, he retired to&nbsp;Charnock, his native place, and was for many years supported by his son. Two years before his death, Mr Roscoe&nbsp;removed him to his own house at Birchfield, where his&nbsp;latter days were soothed by the assiduous kindness of his&nbsp;two children. Having reached an advanced age, he died&nbsp;in 1796. His wife, whose name was Elizabeth, is said to&nbsp;have been a woman of a superior mind and of warm affections, and to have exercised over the character of her son&nbsp;an influence, of which the effects were never obliterated to&nbsp;the latcst period of his life</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">The first elements of learning he acquired under the tuition of a schoolmistress ; and at the age of six, he was removed to a day-school kept by Mr Martin in Paradise Street. After an interval of about two years, he became&nbsp;the pupil of Mr Sykes, who, in the same house, kept a school&nbsp;for writing, arithmetic, and English grammar. He had a numerous seminary, and was considered as a good instructor&nbsp;in his own department. At the age of twelve Roscoe quitted this school, the master having reported that his scholar&nbsp;had learned all that he professed to teach ; which, besides&nbsp;English grammar, included the common rules of arithmetic,&nbsp;algebra, and mensuration. He acquired a very early relish&nbsp;for reading, and particularly for poetical reading. “ I was&nbsp;at this period of my life,” he has recorded, “ of a wild,&nbsp;rambling, and unsocial disposition ; passing many of my&nbsp;hours in strolling along the shore of the river Mersey, or in&nbsp;fishing, or in taking long walks alone....I now began to assist my father in his agricultural concerns, particularly in&nbsp;his business of cultivating potatoes for sale, of which he&nbsp;every year grew several acres, and which he sold, when produced early in the season, at very advanced prices. His&nbsp;mode of cultivation was entirely by the spade ; and when&nbsp;raised early, they were considered in that part of Lancashire as a favourite esculent. When they had attained their&nbsp;proper growth, we were accustomed to carry them to the&nbsp;market on our heads, in large baskets, for sale, where I was&nbsp;generally intrusted with the disposal of them, and soon became a very useful assistant to my father. In this and other&nbsp;laborious occupations, particularly in the care of a garden,&nbsp;in which I took great pleasure, I passed several years of my&nbsp;life, devoting my hours of relaxation to reading my books.&nbsp;This mode of life gave health and vigour to my body, and&nbsp;amusement and instruction to my mind ; and to this day I&nbsp;well remember the delicious sleep which succeeded my&nbsp;labours, from which I was again called at an early hour.&nbsp;If I were now asked whom I consider to be happiest of the&nbsp;human race, I should answer, those who cultivate the earth&nbsp;by their own hands.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having reached his fifteenth year, he found it expedient to make choice of a profession. His love of reading induced him to prefer the avocation of a bookseller ; but he&nbsp;was disappointed in his expectation of finding it altogether&nbsp;pleasant, and after a trial of a month, he returned to his rustic&nbsp;labours. In the course of the ensuing year, 1769, he was&nbsp;articled to a young attorney, who died before the completion of his clerkship. The remainder of it was passed in&nbsp;the office of Mr Peter Ellames, who was eminent in his&nbsp;profession, and who was much satisfied with his pupil’s talents and industry. During this period, he still continued&nbsp;to reside with his father, but he had previously the misfortune to Jose his mother. Although very punctual in his&nbsp;attention to business, he always found some precious intervals of leisure for the cultivation of his literary talents ;&nbsp;and his early love of poetry had its usual effect in purifying&nbsp;and refining the taste. His chief favourite was Shenstone,&nbsp;with whose elegant simplicity he appears to have been&nbsp;greatly captivated. He cultivated an intimate friendship&nbsp;with other ingenuous youths, who cherished the same love&nbsp;of literature. In conjunction with two ot these, William&nbsp;Clarke and Richard Lowndes, he applied himself to the&nbsp;study of the ancient languages ; and with these individuals,&nbsp;to the close of their lives, he continued in habits of the&nbsp;strictest intimacy. They had another associate, who was&nbsp;capable of directing as well as participating in their studies.&nbsp;This was Francis Holden, a young man of uncommon talents, who was an assistant in his uncle’s school, where it&nbsp;was his business to teach, not only mathematics, but likewise the Greek, Latin, Italian, and French languages.&nbsp;They were accustomed to meet early in the morning, and&nbsp;to pursue their classical studies till the hours of business&nbsp;called them to less genial avocations. It was the example</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
