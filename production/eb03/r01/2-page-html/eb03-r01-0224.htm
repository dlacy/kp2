<p><span class="font2">perfons condemned by the revolutionary tribunal. So unequally had property been divided under the ancient&nbsp;government, that by means of theſe conſiſcations about&nbsp;ſeven-tenths of the national territory was fuppoſed to&nbsp;be in the hands of the public. To this was added the&nbsp;plunder of the churches, conſiſting of gold and ſilvcr&nbsp;faints, and utenſils employed in divine worſhip, along&nbsp;wtth other articles of ieſs value ; among which may be&nbsp;mentioned the innumerable church bells, which were regarded as ſufficient for the manufacture of 15,000 pieces&nbsp;of cannon. Theſe refources formed a mafs of property&nbsp;ſuch as never was poſſeſſed by any government.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Other committees were engaged in very different objects. Highways were conſtructed, and canals planned and cut throughout the country. Immenſe manufacto-ries of arms were everywhere eſtabliſhed. At Paris&nbsp;alone 1100 muſkets were daily fabricated, and ioo&nbsp;pieces of cannon caſt every month. Public ſehools&nbsp;were affiduouſly inſtituted, and the French language&nbsp;taught in its purity from the Pyrenees to the Rhine.&nbsp;The French Convention poffeffed immenſe reſources,&nbsp;and they did not heſitate to laviſh them upon their&nbsp;ſchemes. Every ſcience and every art was called upon&nbsp;ſor aid, and the moſt accompliſhed men in every profeffion were employed in giving ſplendour to their country. The chemiſts, in particular, gave effential aid by&nbsp;the facility with wliicli they ſupplied materials for the&nbsp;manufacture of gun-powder ; and in return for their&nbsp;ſervices, Lavoiſier, the greateſt of them, ſuffered death&nbsp;by a moſt iniquitous ſentence. Not fewer than 200 new&nbsp;dramatic performances were produced in leſs than two&nbsp;years ; the object of which was to attach the people to&nbsp;the preſent order of things. The vigour with which&nbsp;the committees of ſubſiſtence exerted themſelves is particularly to be remarked. As all Europe was at war&nbsp;with France, and as England, Holland, and Spain, the&nbsp;three maritime powers, were engaged in the conteſt, it&nbsp;had been thought not impoffible to reduce France to&nbsp;great diſtreſs by famine, eſpecially as it was imagined&nbsp;that the country had not reſources to ſupply its immenſe&nbsp;population. But the preſent leaders of that country&nbsp;acted with the policy of a beſteged garriſon. They&nbsp;ſeized upon the whole proviſions in the country, and&nbsp;carried them to public granaries. They regiſtered the&nbsp;cattle, and made their owners reſponſible for them.—&nbsp;They provided tlie armies abundantly, and, as the people were accurately numbered, they dealt out in every&nbsp;diſtrict, on ſtated occaſtons, what was abfolutely neceffary ſor ſubſiſtence, and no more. To ali this the peo-ple ſubmitted </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span class="font2"> and indeed, throughout the whole of&nbsp;the mixed ſcenes of this revolution, the calm judgment&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the hiſtorian is not a little perplexed. WC cannot&nbsp;avoid admiring the patience with which the people at&nbsp;Iarge endured every hardſhſp that was repreſented as&nbsp;weceſſary to the common cauſe, and the enthuſiaſtic&nbsp;energy with which they laviſhed their blood in defence&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">the independence oſ their country. At the ſame&nbsp;time, we muſt regard with indignation a»d diſguſt the&nbsp;worthlefs intrigues by means of which the ſanguinary&nbsp;factions in the Convention and the capital alternately&nbsp;maffacred each other.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">During the winter the diſſenſions of the Jacobins ftill increaſed. They were divided into two clubs, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which the new one aſſembled at a hall whieh once be</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">longed </span><span class="font2">to the Cordeliers- The leaders </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font2">it were He-</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">bert, Ronſin, Vhtcent, and others ; but the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">old </span><span class="font2">.ſociety retained its aſcendency, and Robefpierre was now &lt;Je-cidedly its leader. This extraordinary man had grada-ally accumulated in his own perſon the conſidence of the&nbsp;people and the direction of the government. As the&nbsp;committees were above the Convention, which was become little more than a ſilent court of record, ſo the&nbsp;committee of public ſaſety was above the other commit-tees. Robefpierre was the leader of this ruling com.&nbsp;mſttee. Barrere, St Juſt, Couthon, and others of its&nbsp;members, only acted a ſecondary part. They laboured&nbsp;in the buſinefs of the ſtate, but the radical power was&nbsp;with Robefpierre. He ſurrounded the members of the&nbsp;Convention with ſpies. He was jealous and implacable,&nbsp;and ſet no bounds to the ſhedding of blood. On the&nbsp;25th of March he brought to trial the following active&nbsp;Jacobins, who were condemned and executed on thc&nbsp;following day : Hebert, Ronſin, Momoro, Vincent,&nbsp;Du Croquet, Kocq, Col. Laumur, M. M. Bourgeois,&nbsp;Mazuel, La Boureau, Ancard, Le Clerc, Proly, Deſ-ſieux, Anacharſis Cloots, Pereira, Florent Armand,&nbsp;Deſcombes, and Dcbuiſon. Not ſatisſied with this, on&nbsp;thc 2d of April he brought to trial nine of thoſe who&nbsp;had once been his moſt vigorous aſſociates, Danton*&nbsp;Fabre d’Eglantine, Bazire, Chabot, Philippeaux, Camille D'eſmoulins, Lacroix, Delaunay d’Angers, He-rault de Sechelles, who, along with weſterqian, were&nbsp;executed on the evening of the 5th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Still, however, the preparations for the enſuing campaign were proceeding with unabated vigour. 'The&nbsp;committee for military affairs, at the head of which&nbsp;were Carnot, La Fitte, d’Aniffi, and others, was bufy&nbsp;in arranging along the frontiers the immenſe force which&nbsp;the requiſitſon had called forth. Plans of attack and&nbsp;defence were made out by this committee; and when approved by the committee of public ſafety they were fent&nbsp;to the generals to be executed. On the other ſide, the&nbsp;allies were making powerful preparations for another&nbsp;attempt to ſubjugate France. The Emperor himſelf&nbsp;took the held at the head of the armies in the Nether-lands. The plan of the campaign is ſaid to have been,&nbsp;formed by the Auſtrias Colonel Mack, weſt Flanders&nbsp;was to be protected by a ſtrong body of men ; the&nbsp;main army was to penetrate to Landrecies, and getting&nbsp;within the line of French frontier towns, it was to cut&nbsp;them off from the interior by covering the country from&nbsp;Maubeuge to the ſea. The plan was </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bold.</span><span class="font2"> It belongs&nbsp;to military men to judge whether this was not its only&nbsp;merit, when attempting to put it in execution, the&nbsp;allies muſt have been ill informed of the immenſe force&nbsp;which the French were collecting againſt therm Even&nbsp;the town of Liſſe alone, which is capable of containing&nbsp;a numerous army within its walls, and which was to be&nbsp;left in their rear, ſhould have ſeerned an inſurmountable&nbsp;objection to the plan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">On the 16th of April the Auſtrian, Britiſh, and Dutch armies affembled on the heights above Cateau,&nbsp;and were reviewed by the emperor. On the following&nbsp;day they advanced in eight columne againſt the French,&nbsp;drove in tlieir whole poſts, and* penetrated beyond Lan-drecies which place the French attempted to. relieve,&nbsp;but without ſuccefs.
