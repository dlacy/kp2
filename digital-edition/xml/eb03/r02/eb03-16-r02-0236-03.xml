<p><label>RICOCHET</label>
in gunnery, is when guns, howitzers, or mortars, are loaded with ſmall charges, and elevated from 5 to 12 degrees, ſo as to fire over the parapet, and the ſhot or ſhell rolls along the oppoſite rampart: it is called <hi rend="italic">ricochet-ſiring,</hi> and the batteries are likewiſe called <hi rend="italic">ricochet-batteries.</hi> This method of firing was firſt invented by M. Belidor, and firſt uſed at the ſiege of Ath in 1697. This mode of firing out of mortars was firſt tried in 1723 at the military ſchool at Straſhourg, and with ſucceſs. At the battle of Roſ-bach, in 1757, the king of Pruſſia had ſeveral 6-inch mortars made with trunnions, and mounted on travelling -carriages, which fired obliquely on the enemy's lines, and amongſt their horſe, loaded with 8 ounces of powder, and at an elevation of one degree 15 minutes, which did great execution; for the ſhells rolling along the lines, with burning fuzes, made the ſtouteſt of the enemy not wait for their burſting.</p>
