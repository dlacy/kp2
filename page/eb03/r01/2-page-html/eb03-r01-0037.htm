<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Propagation.</span><span class="font2"> All the varieties of the Aſiatic ranunculus propagate abundantly by off-ſets from the root, and new varieties are gained by ſeed.— </span><span class="font1">I. </span><span class="font2">By off-ſets.&nbsp;The time for ſeparating the off-ſets is in ſummer when&nbsp;the flower is paſt, and the leaves and ſtalks are withered : then taking up all the ro'ots in dry weather, feparate the off-ſets from each main root, and alter drying&nbsp;the whole gradually in ſome ſhady airy room, put them&nbsp;up in bags till the autumn and ſpring ſeaſons of planting ; then plant them as before, placing all the off-ſets&nbsp;in ſeparate beds : many of them will blow the firſt year,&nbsp;but in the ſecond they will all flower in good perfection.—2. By ſeed. Save a quantity of ſeed from the&nbsp;fineſt ſemi-double flowers, and ſow it either in Auguſt,&nbsp;or in March, or April, though, to ſave trouble -of winter-covering, ſome prefer the ſpring : it ſhould be lowed&nbsp;in light rich mould, either in pots or in an eaſt border,&nbsp;drawing very ſhallow flat drills five or fix inches aſunder, in which ſow the feeds thinly, and cover them&nbsp;lightly with earth, giving frequent refreſhments of water in dry weather, and in a month or ſix weeks the&nbsp;plants will rife with fmall leaves ; obſerving to continue&nbsp;the light waterings in dry weather, to preſerve the foil&nbsp;xnoiſt during their fummer’s growth to increaſe the ſize&nbsp;of the roots ; and in June when the leaves decay, take&nbsp;up the roots and preſerve them till the ieaſon for planting, then plant them in common beds, as before directed, and they will flower the ſpring following, when&nbsp;all the doubles of good properties ſhould be marked,&nbsp;and the Angles thrown away.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAPE, in law, the carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and againſt her will. This, by the Jewiſh law,&nbsp;was pu ni ſhed with death, in caſe the damſel was betrothed to another man : and, in cafe ſhe was not betrothed, then a heavy fine of fifty ſhekels was to be paid&nbsp;to the damſel’s father, and ſhe was to be the wife of&nbsp;the raviſher all the days of his life ; without that power&nbsp;of divorce, which was in general permitted by the Moſaic law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The civil law puniſhes the crime of raviſhment with death and confifcation of goods: under which it includes&nbsp;both the offence of forcible abduction, or taking away&nbsp;a woman from her friends ; and alſo the preſent offence&nbsp;of forcibly diſhonouring her ; either of which, without&nbsp;the other, is in that law ſufficient to conſtitute a capital&nbsp;crime. Alſo the ſtealing away a woman from her parents or guardians, and debauching her, is equaſly penal&nbsp;by the emperor’s edict, whether ſhe conſent or is forced.&nbsp;And this, in order to take away from women every&nbsp;opportunity of offending in this way; whom the Ro-man laws ſuppoſe never to go aſtray without the ſeduction and arts of the other ſex ; and therefore, by&nbsp;reſtraining and making ſo highly penal the ſolicitations&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1">men, </span><span class="font2">they meant to fecure effectually the honour</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of the women. But our Engliſh law does not enter* tain quite ſuch ſublime ideas of the honour of either&nbsp;ſex, as to lay the blame of a mutual fault upon one of&nbsp;the tranfgreffors only ; and therefore makes it a neceſk&nbsp;fary ingredient in the crime of rape, that it muſt be&nbsp;againſt the woman’s wiſl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rape was puniſhed by the Saxon laws, particularly thoſe of king Athelſtan, with death ; which was alſo&nbsp;agreeable to the old Gothic or Scandinavian conſtitution. But this was afterwards thought too hard : and&nbsp;in its ſtead another ſevere, but not capital, puniſhment&nbsp;was inflicted by william the Conqueror, viz. caſtration&nbsp;and loſs oſ eyes ; which continued till after Bracton&nbsp;wrote, in the reign of Henry III. But in order&nbsp;to prevent malicious accuſations, it was then the law,&nbsp;(and, it ſeems, ſtill continues to be ſo in appeals of&nbsp;rape), that the woman ſhould, immediately after, go to&nbsp;the next town, and there make diſcovery to ſome credible perſons of the injury ſhe has ſuffered ; and afterwards ſhould acquaint the high conſtable of the hundred,&nbsp;the coroners, and the ſheriff, with the outrage. This&nbsp;ſeems to correfpond in ſome degree with the laws of&nbsp;Scotland and Arragon, which require that complaint&nbsp;muſt be made within 24 hours : though afterwards by&nbsp;ſtatute w’eſtm. </span><span class="font1">I. </span><span class="font2">c. 13. the time of limitation in England was extended to 40 days. At preſent there is no ∙&nbsp;time of limitation fixed: for, as it is uſuaſly now puniſhed by indictment at the fuit of the king, the maxim of&nbsp;law takes place, that &quot; nullum tempus occurrit regi&nbsp;but the jury will rarely give credit to a ſtale complaint.&nbsp;During the former period alſo it was held for law, that&nbsp;the woman (by conſent of the judge and her parents)&nbsp;might redeem the offender from the execution of his&nbsp;ſentence, by accepting him for her huſhand ; if he alſo ■&nbsp;wa⅛ willing to agree to the exchange* but not otherwiſe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In the 3 Edw. I. by the ftatuté weſtſh. </span><span class="font1">r. c. 13. </span><span class="font2">the puniſhment of rape was much mitigated : the of--fence itſelf, of raviſhing a damſel within age, (that is,&nbsp;twelve years old) either with her conſent or without, or&nbsp;of any other woman againſt her will, being reduced to&nbsp;a trefpaſs,· if not proſccuted by appeal within 40 days,&nbsp;and ſubjecting the offender onIy to two years impriſon-ment, and a fine-at the king’s will.· But this lenity&nbsp;being productive of the moſt terrible conſequences, it&nbsp;was, in ten years afterwards, 13 Edw. I. found ncceffa-ιy to make the offence of forcible rape felony by ſtatute&nbsp;w^eftm. 2. c. 34. And by ſtatute 18 Eliz. c. 7. it is&nbsp;made felony without benefit of clergy : as is alſo the&nbsp;abominable wickedneſs of carnaſly knowing or abuſing&nbsp;any woman-child under the age of ten years ; in which&nbsp;caſe the conſent or non-confent is immaterial, as by&nbsp;reaſon of her tender years ſhe is incapable of judgment&nbsp;and diſcretion. Sir Matthew Hale is indeed of opinion,&nbsp;that ſuch profligate actions committed on an infant under the age of twelve years, the age oi female diſcretion&nbsp;by the common law, either with or without conſent,&nbsp;amount to rape and felony·; as well ſincc as before the&nbsp;ſtatute of queen Elizabeth : but that law has in general&nbsp;been held only to extend to infants under ten ; though&nbsp;it fnould ſeem that damſels between ten and twelve are&nbsp;ſtiil under the protection of the ſtatute wctlm. 1. the&nbsp;lav/ with reſpect to their ſeduction not having been al-tered by either of the ſubfequent ſtatutes.</span></p>
