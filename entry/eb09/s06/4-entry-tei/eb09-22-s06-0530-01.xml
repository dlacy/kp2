<hi rend="smallcaps">Daniel (c.</hi> 1760-1823), pianist and composer, was born between the years 1755 and 1765 at Berlin, where he studied, at the expense of the crown prince Frederick William, under Kirnberger. Very little is known of his artistic life before 1790, when he settled in Paris, and attained great popularity as a <hi rend="italic">virtuoso</hi> by means of a pianoforte sonata called <hi rend="italic">La Coquette,</hi> which he composed, in conjunction with Hermann, for Queen Marie Antoinette, and almost equal credit as a dramatic composer by an opera entitled <hi rend="italic">Romeo et Juliette,</hi> produced at the Théâtre Feydeau in 1793. In 1796 Steibelt removed to London, where his pianoforte playing attracted an amount of attention which in 1798 was raised to an absolute <hi rend="italic">furore</hi> by the production of his concerto (No. 3, in Eb) containing the famous “Storm Rondo”—a work that ensured his popularity, in spite of the far higher claims of Clementi, Dussek, and John Baptist Cramer, whose attainments as <hi rend="italic">virtuosi,</hi> composers, and thoroughly accomplished artists were infinitely superior to his own. In the following year Steibelt started on a professional tour in Germany ; and, after playing with some success in Hamburg, Dresden, Prague, and Berlin, he arrived in May 1800 at Vienna, where, with the arrogance which formed one of the most prominent characteristics of his nature, he challenged Beethoven to a trial of skill, which naturally resulted in his irretrievable discomfiture. His position in Germany being no longer tenable after this pitiful failure, he retired to Paris, and during the next eight years lived alternately in that city and in London, where his reputation continued undiminished. In 1808 he was invited by the emperor Alexander to St Petersburg, and there he resided, in the enjoyment of a lucrative appointment, until his death on September 20, 1823.</p><p>Besides his dramatic music, Steibelt left behind him an enormous number of compositions for the pianoforte, many of which exhibit a certain amount of originality, though they can scarcely be regarded as works of genius. His playing, though exceedingly brilliant, was wanting in the higher qualities which so strikingly characterized that of his contemporaries, John Cramer and Muzio Clementi ; but he was undoubtedly gifted with talents of a very high order, and the reputation he enjoyed was fairly earned and honourably maintained to the end.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
