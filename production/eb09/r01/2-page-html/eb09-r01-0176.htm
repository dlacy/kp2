<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">worship and from what is known of the religious customs of the Malagasy, especially the Hovas, the ancient Malay&nbsp;religions did not differ more from the Polynesian and the&nbsp;Melanesian than do the languages. There is one institution especially which, though in principle and to a certain&nbsp;degree common to all ancient religions, has nowhere&nbsp;acquired that importance and that peculiar development&nbsp;which it has grown to in the Polynesian aud the Melanesian religions, the institution of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">taboo,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> a kind of&nbsp;interdict laid on objects and persons, by which they are&nbsp;made sacred and inviolable. Now this taboo, which more&nbsp;than anything else characterizes these religions, was equally&nbsp;important in Madagascar before Radama’s reforms, and&nbsp;exists also among the Malays, who call it Pamali, nay,&nbsp;even among the Australians, who call it Kuinyunda,&nbsp;There are some other customs common to all these nations,&nbsp;as the particular worship of the ghosts of the deceased,&nbsp;some ordeals, &amp;c., but this is of minor importance. The&nbsp;general observance of such a peculiar custom as the taboo&nbsp;by all the peoples belonging to this ethnic family, a custom&nbsp;which rules their whole religion, gives us the right to&nbsp;speak of a Malayo-Polynesian family of religions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">One distinct branch of this family is the Polynesian, which has everywhere the same myths with only local&nbsp;varieties, and the same supreme god Taaroa or Tangaroa.&nbsp;The Micronesian branch is only a subdivision of it. The&nbsp;Melanesian branch differs more widely, but agrees in the&nbsp;main, and the supreme god Ndengei, whether original or&nbsp;borrowed, is evidently the same as Tangaroa. That the&nbsp;Malay branch had its marked subdivisions is very probable ; but the settlement of this difficult question must&nbsp;be left to further research. According to ethnologists the&nbsp;Australians and the now extinct Tasmanians do not belong&nbsp;to the Malayo-Polynesian race. But, as their religion&nbsp;shows the same prominent characteristic as the Polynesian,&nbsp;and, moreover, agrees with it in other respects, they must&nbsp;be in some way related.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">These are the rough outlines of a genealogical classification of religions. It embraces nearly all of them. Only a few have been purposely left out, such as those of the&nbsp;Dravidas, the Munda tribes, and the Sinhalese in India,&nbsp;partly for want of trustworthy information, partly because&nbsp;it is not yet certain what belongs to them originally and&nbsp;what is due to Hindu influence. At any rate we cannot&nbsp;consider their religions as allied to the Ural-Altaic. We&nbsp;have also omitted the religions of the Basque or Euscal-dunac, of which nothing particular is known, and for&nbsp;obvious reasons the Etrurian. Even if the intricate problem with regard to their language could be solved, the&nbsp;Etrurians borrowed so much from the Greek mythology&nbsp;that it would be next to impossible to state what kind of&nbsp;religion they originally had as their own.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morphological Classification of Religions.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—In his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lectures on the Science of Religion,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> pp. 123-143, Prof. Max Müller, who has done so much to raise the comparative&nbsp;study of religions to the rank of a science, criticizes the&nbsp;most usual modes of classification applied to religions, viz.,&nbsp;(1) that into true and false, (2) that into revealed and&nbsp;natural, (3) that into national and individual, (4) that&nbsp;into polytheistic, dualistic, and monotheistic, and dismisses each and all of them as useless and impracticable.&nbsp;In this we cannot but acquiesce in his opinion and hold his&nbsp;judgment as decisive. The only exception we should like&nbsp;to take refers to the classification under (3), which, as we&nbsp;shall presently show, contains more truth than he is disposed to admit. And when he winds up his argument&nbsp;with the assertion that “the only scientific and truly&nbsp;genetic classification of religions is the same as the classification of languages ” we must dissent from him. Even&nbsp;the genealogical classification of religions does not always</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">run parallel with that of languages. Prof. Max Müller says that, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> particularly in the early history of the human&nbsp;intellect, there exists the most intimate relationship&nbsp;between language, religion, and nationality.” This may&nbsp;be generally true</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> we do not deny it. But the farther&nbsp;history advances the more does religion become independent of both language and nationality. And that the&nbsp;stage of development a religion has attained to—the one&nbsp;thing to be considered for a morphological classification—&nbsp;has nothing to do with the language of its adherents is&nbsp;obvious. Now for a really scientific study of religions&nbsp;such a morphological classification is absolutely necessary,&nbsp;and therefore we are bound by our subject to give our&nbsp;opinion with regard to the truly scientific principle on&nbsp;which it ought to be based.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">First let us see what has already been done to this effect by one of the best authorities. Prof. W. D.&nbsp;Whitney, in an interesting article “ On the so-called&nbsp;Science of Religion,” declares for the well-known classification of religions into national and individual. To quote&nbsp;his own words, “ There is no more marked distinction&nbsp;among religions than the one we are called upon to make&nbsp;between a race religion—which, like a language, is the&nbsp;collective product of the wisdom of a community, the&nbsp;unconscious growth of generations—and a religion proceeding from an individual founder, who, as leading representative of the better insight and feeling of his time (for&nbsp;otherwise he would meet with no success), makes head&nbsp;against formality and superstition, and recalls his fellow-men to sincere and intelligent faith in a new body of&nbsp;doctrines, of specially moral aspect, to which he himself&nbsp;gives shape and coherence. Of this origin are Zoroastrianism, Mohammedanism, Buddhism; and, from the&nbsp;point of view of the general historian of religions, whatever difference of character and authority he may recognize&nbsp;in its founder, Christianity belongs in the same class with&nbsp;them, as being an individual and universal religion, growing out of one that was limited to a race.” We hardly&nbsp;think that this reasoning can be unconditionally assented&nbsp;to. At any rate we must put it in another way. Before&nbsp;the American scholar’s essay was published, it had already&nbsp;been judiciously observed by Prof. Max Müller that,&nbsp;though neither a Brahman, nor a Greek, nor a Roman&nbsp;could name the name of the founder of his religion, we&nbsp;discover even there the influence of individual minds or&nbsp;schools or climates. So he thinks that this classification&nbsp;is useful for certain purposes, but fails as soon as we&nbsp;attempt to apply it in a more scientific spirit. This is&nbsp;partially true. What is the wisdom of a community but&nbsp;the wisdom of its more enlightened members, that is, of&nbsp;individuals! Religions of which the origin and history&nbsp;lies in the dark may be called the unconscious growth of&nbsp;generations, but in a figurative sense only. If they have&nbsp;a mythology and a ritual of their own, it may be the&nbsp;result of something like natural selection ; but every myth&nbsp;meant to explain natural phenomena, every rite meant to&nbsp;still the wrath or to win the favour of the higher powers&nbsp;and accepted as an integral part of their faith and worship,&nbsp;perhaps first by some more advanced members of a tribe&nbsp;or nation or community only, afterwards by all of them,&nbsp;was originally the creation of one single human mind.&nbsp;On the other hand, if founders of higher religions are&nbsp;themselves “the leading representatives of the better&nbsp;insight and feeling of their time,” then here too there is&nbsp;only growth ; they are at the head of their contemporaries,&nbsp;because the better insight and feeling of the latter culminate in them, and because they are able to lend them a&nbsp;shape which makes the more advanced ideas and sentiments agreeable to the minds and hearts of the many;&nbsp;but they meet with success only when that which they</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
