<p><span class="font1">RAMSEY, a town of Huntingdonſhire, 68 miles north of London, and 12 north-eaſt of Huntingdon.&nbsp;It is ſituated as it were in an iſland, being everywhere&nbsp;.encompaffed with fens, except on the weſt, where it is&nbsp;ſeparated from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">terra firma</span><span class="font1"> by a cauſey for two&nbsp;■miles. The neighbouring meers of Ramſey and whitle-ſey, which are formed by the river Nyne, abound with&nbsp;fowl and fiſh, efpecially eel and large pikes. It was&nbsp;once famous for a very rich abbey, part of the gatehoufe&nbsp;of which is ſtill ſtanding, and a neglected ſtatue of Ail-win ; the epitaph of whoſe tomb, which is reckoned&nbsp;one of the oldeſt pieces of Engliſh ſculpture extant,&nbsp;ftylεs him &quot; kinſman of the famous King Edward, alderman of all England, and the miraculous founder of&nbsp;this abbey.” It was dedicated to St Duriſtan, and its&nbsp;abbots were mitred, and fat in parliament ; and ſo&nbsp;■many kings of England were benefactors to it, that its&nbsp;yearly rents, ſays Camden, were 70001. The town&nbsp;was then called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ramſey the Rich ;</span><span class="font1"> but by the diſſolution&nbsp;of the abbey it foon became poor, and even loſt its market for many years, till about 185 years ago it recovered it. It is held on Saturday, and is reckoned one of&nbsp;the moſt plentiful and cheapeſt in England. In the&nbsp;year 1721 a great number of Roman coins was found&nbsp;here, ſuppoſed to have been hid by the monks on.&nbsp;ſome incurſion of the Danes. There is a charity ſchool&nbsp;in the town for poor girls. W. Long. o. 19. N. Lat.&nbsp;52. 26.</span></p>

It belongs to the biſhopric of St Da-vid’s, and was in the laſt age, ſays Camden, famous for&nbsp;the death of one Juſtinian, a moſt holy man, who retiring hither from Britanny, in that age rich in ſaints,&nbsp;and devoting himſelf entirely to God, lived a long&nbsp;while in ſolitude, and being at laſt murdered by his&nbsp;fervant was enrolled among the martyrs.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ramsey, in the Iſle of Man, to the north, a moſt </span><span class="font1">noted and ſpaclous haven, in which the grcat¢ſt fleet </span><span class="font0">may&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ride at anchor with ſafety enough from all winds but the&nbsp;north eaſt, and in that caſe they need not be embayed.&nbsp;This town ſtanding upon a beach of looſe fand, or ſhingle,&nbsp;is in danger, if not timely prevented, of being waſhed&nbsp;away by the fea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSGATE, a ſea-port town of Kent, in the iſle of Thanet, five miles from Margate, where a very fine&nbsp;pier has been lately built for the ſecurity of ſhips that&nbsp;come into the harbour, being ſeated near the Downs,&nbsp;between the north and fouth Foreland, 10 miles north-ea∙ft of Canterbury. The town is ſituated in the cove&nbsp;of a chalky cliff. It was formerly but an obfcure fiſh-ing village, but ſince the year 1688 has been improved&nbsp;and enlarged by a ſuccefsful trade to Ruſſia and the&nbsp;eaſt country. But what renders it moſt worthy of notice, and attracts multitudes of ſtrangers, is the new&nbsp;harbour, which is one of the moſt capacious in England, if not in Europe. It was begun in the year&nbsp;1750, but delayed by various interruptions. It con-ſiſts of two piers ; that to the eaſt is built wholly of&nbsp;Purbeck ſtone, and extends itfelf into the ocean near&nbsp;800 feet before it forms an angle ; its breadth on the&nbsp;top is 26 feet, including a ſtrong parapet wall, which&nbsp;runs along the outſide of it. The other to the weſt is&nbsp;conſtructed of wood as far as the low-water mark, but&nbsp;the reſt is of ſtone. The angles, of which there are&nbsp;five in each pier, conſiſt of 160 feet each, with octa-gons at the end of 60 feet diameter, leaving an en-trance of 200 feet into the harbour, the depth of which&nbsp;admits of a gradual increaſe of 18 to 36 feet.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ramus (Peter), was one of the moſt famous pro* feſſors of the 16th century. He was born in Picardy&nbsp;in 1515. A thirſt tor learning prompted him to go&nbsp;to Paris when very young, and he was admitted a ſervant in the college of Navarre. Spending the day in&nbsp;waiting on his maſters, and the greateſt part of the&nbsp;night in ſtudy, he made ſuch ſurpriſing progreſs, that,&nbsp;when he took his maſter of arts degree, he offered to&nbsp;maintain a quite oppoſite doctrine to that of Ariſtotle.&nbsp;This raifed him many enemies ; and the two firſt&nbsp;books he publiſhed, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inβitutiones Dialectic#,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Arifio-telic&lt;e Aaimadverfiοnes,</span><span class="font1"> occaſioned great diſturbances in&nbsp;the univerſity of Paris : and the oppoſition againſt him&nbsp;was not a little heightened by his deſerting the Romiſh&nbsp;religion, and profeſſing that of the Reformed. Beiκg&nbsp;thus forced to retire from Paris, he viſited the univtr-ſities of Germany, and received great honours wſhere-ever he came. He returned to France in 157r, and&nbsp;ioſt his life miſerably in the horrid maffacre of St Bartholomew’s day. He was a great orator, a man°of ur.i-verſal learning, and endowed with very fine moral quad-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
