                time that these measures were with him only&nbsp;means to the further end of
                creating for himself a position&nbsp;such as that which Pompey had already won; and
                this&nbsp;ulterior aim he pursued with a skill, and with an
                audacious&nbsp;indifference to constitutional forms and usages, unsurpassed even by
                Sulla. His coalition with Crassus, soon&nbsp;after Pompey’s departure, secured him
                an ally whose&nbsp;colossal wealth and wide financial connexions were
                of&nbsp;inestimable value, and whose vanity and inferiority of&nbsp;intellect
                rendered him a willing tool. The story of his&nbsp;attempted </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">coup détat</span><span class="font1"> in
                January 65 is probably false,@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>but it is evident that by the
                beginning of 63 he was bent&nbsp;on reaping the reward of his exertions by obtaining
                from&nbsp;the people an extraordinary command abroad, which&nbsp;should secure his
                position before Pompey’s return ; and&nbsp;the agrarian law proposed early that year
                by the tribune&nbsp;Rullus had for its real object the creation, in favour
                of&nbsp;Cæsar and Crassus, of a commission with powers so wide&nbsp;as to place its
                members almost on a level with Pompey&nbsp;himself.@@<sup>2</sup> It was at this
                moment, when all seemed going&nbsp;well, that Cæsar’s hopes were dashed to the
                ground by&nbsp;Catiline’s desperate outbreak, which not only discredited&nbsp;every
                one connected with the popular party, but directed&nbsp;the suspicions of the
                well-to-do classes against Cæsar himself, as a possible accomplice in Catiline’s
                    revolutionary&nbsp;schemes.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The same wave of indignation and suspicion which for the moment
                checked Cæsar’s rise carried Marcus Tullius&nbsp;Cicero to the height of his
                fortunes. Cicero, as a politician, has been equally misjudged by friends and
                foes.&nbsp;That he was deficient in courage, that he was vain, and&nbsp;that he
                attempted the impossible, may be admitted at&nbsp;once. But he was neither a
                brilliant and unscrupulous&nbsp;adventurer nor an aimless trimmer, nor yet a
                devoted&nbsp;champion merely of senatorial ascendency.@@<sup>4</sup> He was
                a&nbsp;representative man, with a numerous following, and a&nbsp;policy which was
                naturally suggested to him by the circumstances of his birth, connexions, and
                profession, and&nbsp;which, impracticable as it proved to be, was yet
                consistent,&nbsp;intelligible, and high-minded. Born at Arpinum, he&nbsp;cherished
                like all Arpinates the memory of his great fellow-townsman Marius, the friend of the
                Italians, the saviour&nbsp;of Italy, and the irreconcilable foe of Sulla and the
                nobles.&nbsp;A “ municipal ” himself, his chosen friends and his
                warmest&nbsp;supporters were found among the well-to-do classes in the&nbsp;Italian
                    towns.@@<sup>5</sup> Unpopular with the Roman aristocracy,&nbsp;who despised him
                as a “ peregrinus,”@@<sup>6</sup> and with the Roman&nbsp;populace, he was the
                trusted leader of the Italian middle&nbsp;class, “ the true Roman people,” as he
                proudly styles them.&nbsp;It was they who carried his election for the
                    consulship@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>(63), who in 58 insisted on his recall from
                    exile,@@<sup>8</sup> and it&nbsp;was his influence with them which made Cæsar so
                anxious&nbsp;to win him over in 49. He represented their antipathy&nbsp;alike to
                socialistic schemes and to aristocratic exclusiveness, and their old-fashioned
                simplicity of life in contrast</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">with the cosmopolitan luxury of the capital.@@<sup>9</sup> By birth,
                too, lie belonged to the equestrian order, the foremost representatives of which
                were indeed still the publicani and&nbsp;Iiegotiatorcs, but which since the
                enfranchisement of Italy&nbsp;included also the substantial burgesses of the
                Italian&nbsp;towns and the smaller “ squires ” of the country districts.&nbsp;With
                them, too, Cicero was at one in their dread of democratic excesses and their social
                and political jealousy of&nbsp;the “ nobiles.”@@<sup>10</sup> Lastly, as a lawyer
                and a scholar, he was&nbsp;passionately attached to the ancient constitution.
                His&nbsp;political ideal was the natural outcome of these circumstances of his
                position. He advocated the maintenance of&nbsp;the old constitution, but not as it
                was understood by the&nbsp;extreme politicians of the right and left. The senate
                was&nbsp;to be the supreme directing council,@@<sup>11</sup> but the senate
                of&nbsp;Cicero’s dreams was not an oligarchic assemblage of nobles,&nbsp;but a body
                freely open to all citizens, and representing&nbsp;the worth of the
                    community.@@<sup>12</sup> The magistrates, while&nbsp;deferring to the senate’s
                authority, were to be at once&nbsp;vigorous and public-spirited ; and the assembly
                itself which&nbsp;elected the magistrates and passed the laws was to
                consist,&nbsp;not of the “ mob of the forum,” but of the true Roman&nbsp;people
                throughout Italy.@@<sup>13</sup> For the realization of this ideal&nbsp;lie looked,
                above all things, to the establishment of cordial&nbsp;relations between the senate
                and nobles in Rome and the&nbsp;great middle class of Italy represented by the
                equestrian&nbsp;order, between the capital and the country towns and districts. This
                was the “ concordia ordinum,” the “ consensus&nbsp;Italiae,” for which he
                    laboured.@@<sup>14</sup> He failed because his&nbsp;ideal was impracticable. The
                inveterate selfishness and&nbsp;exclusiveness of the nobles, the indifference of the
                Italians&nbsp;to constitutional questions, and their suspicious dislike
                of&nbsp;Roman politicians, above all the incompetency of the old&nbsp;machinery,
                even if reformed as he would have had it&nbsp;reformed, to govern the empire and
                control the proconsuls&nbsp;and the army, were insuperable obstacles in his
                way.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Cicero’s election to the consulship for 63 over the heads of Cæsar’s
                nominees, Antonius and Catiline, was mainly&nbsp;the work of the Italian middle
                class, already rendered uneasy both by the rumours which were rife of
                revolutionary&nbsp;schemes and of Cæsar’s boundless ambition, and by
                the&nbsp;numerous disquieting signs of disturbance noticeable in&nbsp;Italy. The new
                consul vigorously set himself to discharge&nbsp;the trust placed in him. He defeated
                the insidious proposals of Rullus for Cæsar’s aggrandizement, and assisted&nbsp;in
                quashing the prosecution of Rabirius. But with the&nbsp;consular elections in the
                autumn of 63 a fresh danger&nbsp;arose from a different quarter. The “
                    conspiracy@@<sup>15</sup> of&nbsp;Catiline ” (see </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">Catiline)</span><span class="font1"> was not the
                work of the popular&nbsp;party, and still less was it an unselfish attempt at reform
                ;&nbsp;L. Sergius Catilina himself was a patrician, who had&nbsp;held high office,
                and possessed considerable ability and&nbsp;courage ; but he was bankrupt in
                character and in purse,&nbsp;and two successive defeats in the consular elections
                had&nbsp;rendered him desperate. To retrieve his broken fortunes&nbsp;by violence
                was a course which was only too readily&nbsp;suggested by the history of the last
                forty years, and&nbsp;materials for a conflagration abounded on all sides.
                The&nbsp;danger to be feared from his intrigues lay in the state of&nbsp;Italy,
                which made a revolt against society and the established government only too likely
                if once a leader presented himself, and it was such a revolt that
