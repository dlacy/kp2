<p><span class="font0">often appearing in perſon at the public diverſions, and in all things ſtudying to render himſelſ dear to the populace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And now Octavianus, entering upon his ſeventh conſulſhip with M. Agrippa, the third time conſiſt, and finding all things ripe for his deſign, the people being&nbsp;highly pleaſed with his mild government, and the ſenate filled with his creatures, whoſe fortunes depended&nbsp;upon his holding the power he had uſurped, went by&nbsp;the advice of Agrippa and Mæcenas to the ſenate-houſe ; and there, in a ſtudied ſpeech, offered to reſign&nbsp;his authority, and put all again into the hands of the&nbsp;people upon the old foundation of the commonwealth ;&nbsp;being well appriſed, that the greater part of the conſcript fathers, whoſe intereſts were interwoven with his,&nbsp;would unanimouſiy preſs him to the contrary : Which&nbsp;happened accordingly ; for they not only interrupted&nbsp;him while he was ſpeaking, but, after he had done, unanimouſiy beſought him to take upon himſelf alone the&nbsp;whole government of the Roman empire. He, with a&nbsp;ſeeming reluctance, yielded at laſt to their requeſt, as if&nbsp;he had been compelled to accept of the ſovereignt.&nbsp;By this artifice he compaſſed his deſign, which was, to&nbsp;get the power and authority, which he had uſurped,&nbsp;confiιmed to him by the ſenate and people for the ſpace&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">io </span><span class="font0">years : for he would not accept of it for a longer&nbsp;term, pretending he ſhould in that time be able to ſettle&nbsp;all things in ſuch peace and order that there would be&nbsp;no further need of his authority ; but that he might&nbsp;then eaſe himſelf of the burden, and put the government again into the hands of the ſenate and people.&nbsp;This method he took to render the yoke leſs heavy ;&nbsp;but with a deſign to renew his leaſe, if we may be allowed the expreſſion, as ſoon as the ten years were expired ; which he did accordingly from ten years to ten&nbsp;years as long as he lived, all the while governing the&nbsp;whole Roman empire with an abſolute and uncontrouled&nbsp;power. With this new authority the ſenate reſolved&nbsp;to diſtinguiſh him with a new name. Some of the conſcript fathers propoſed the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romulus,</span><span class="font0"> thereby&nbsp;to import that he was another founder of Rome; others&nbsp;offered other titles ; but the venerable name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Auguſtus,</span><span class="font0"> propoſed by Manutius Plancus, ſeemed preferable&nbsp;to all the reſt, as it expreſſed more dignity and reverence than authority, the moſt ſacred things, ſuch as&nbsp;temples, and places conſecrated by augurs, being termed&nbsp;by the Romans </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Auguſta.</span><span class="font0"> Octavianus himſell was inclined to aſſume the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romulus ;</span><span class="font0"> but, ſearing he&nbsp;ſhould be ſuſpected of affecting the kingdom, he declined it, and took that of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Auguſtus,</span><span class="font0"> by which we ſhall&nbsp;henceforth diſtinguiſh him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though the whole power of the ſenate and people was now veſted in Auguſtus, yet, that he might ſeem&nbsp;to ſhare it with the conſcript fathers, he reſuſed to govern all the provinces ; aſſigning to the ſenate ſuch as&nbsp;were quiet and peaceable; and keeping to himſelf thoſe&nbsp;which, bordering upon barbarous nations, were moſt expoſed to troubles and wars, ſaying, He deſired the fathers might enjoy their power with eaſe and ſafety,&nbsp;while he underwent all the dangers and labours : but,&nbsp;by this politic conduct, he ſecured all the military power&nbsp;to himſelf ; the troops lying in the provinces he had&nbsp;choſen ; and the others, which were governed by the&nbsp;ſenate, being quite deſtitute of ſc.rces. The latter were&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſenatorial,</span><span class="font0"> and the former </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperial,</span><span class="font0"> provinces. O∙&nbsp;ver the provinces of both ſorts were ſet men of diſtinction, to wit, ſuch as had been conſuls or prætors, with&nbsp;the titles of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proconſul</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proprietor ;</span><span class="font0"> but the government of Egypt was committed to a private knight,&nbsp;Auguſtus ſearing left a perſon of rank, depending upon the wealth and ſituation of that country, might&nbsp;raiſe new diſturbances in the empire. All theſe governors held their employment only for a year, and were&nbsp;upon the arrival of their ſucceſſors to depart their provinces immediately, and not fail to be at Rome within&nbsp;three months at the fartheſt. This diviſion of the provinces was made, according to Ovid, on the ides of January ; whereas he was veſted by the ſenate and people&nbsp;with the ſovereign power on the ſeventh of the ides of&nbsp;the ſame month, as is manifeſt from the Narbonne marbles ; and ſrom that time many writers date the years&nbsp;of his empire. Thus ended the greateſt commonwealth,&nbsp;and at the ſame time began the greateſt monarchy, that&nbsp;had ever been known ; a monarchy which infinitely excelled in power, riches, extent; and continuance, all the&nbsp;empires which had preceded it..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It comprehended the greateſt and by ſar the beſt part of Europe, Aſia, and Aſrica, being near 4000 miles in&nbsp;length, and about half as much fin breadth. As to the&nbsp;yearly revenues of the empire, they have by a moderate&nbsp;computation been reckoned to amount to forty millions&nbsp;of our money. But the Romans themſelves now ran&nbsp;hodlong into all manner of luxury and effeminacy.&nbsp;The people were become a mere mob ; thoſe who w<sup>,</sup>ere&nbsp;wont to direct mighty wars, to raiſe and depoſe great&nbsp;kings, to beſtow or take away potent empires, were ſe&nbsp;ſunk and debauched, that, if they had but bread and&nbsp;ſhows, their ambition went no higher. The nobility&nbsp;were indeed more polite than in former ages; but at&nbsp;the ſame time idle, venal, vicious, inſenſible of private&nbsp;virtue, utter .ſtrangers to public glory or diſgrace, void&nbsp;of zeal for the welfare of their country, and ſolely intent on gaining the favour of the emperor, as knowing&nbsp;that certain wealth and preferment were the rewards of&nbsp;ready ſubmiſſion, acquieſcence, and flattery. No wonder, therefore, that they loſt their liberty, without being ever again able to retrieve it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Auguſtus, now abſolute maſter of the Roman empire, took all methods to ingratiate himſelf with his ſoldiers, by whoſe means he had attained ſuch a height&nbsp;of power. With this view, he diſperſed them through&nbsp;different parts of Iζaly in 32 colonies, that he might the&nbsp;more eaſily reaſſemble them on proper occaſions. He&nbsp;kept 25 legions conſtantly on foot, 17 of which were&nbsp;in Europe ; viz. eight on the Rhine, four on the Danube, three in Spain, and two in Dalmatia. The other&nbsp;eight were ſent into Aſia and Africa ; four of them&nbsp;being quartered in the neighbourhood of the Euphrates, two in Egypt, and two in Africa Propria, that is,&nbsp;the ancient dominions of Carthage. All theſe forces,&nbsp;amounting to 170,650 men, were conſtantly kept on&nbsp;foot by the Roman emperors for ſeveral ages. In the&nbsp;neighbourhood of Rome were always quartered 12 co-·&nbsp;horts, that is, about 10,∞0 men ; nine of which were&nbsp;called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">prœtorian cohorts ;</span><span class="font0"> the other three, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">city cohorts.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Theſe were eſtabliſhed as a guard to the emperor, and.&nbsp;to maintain peace and tranquillity in the city, but had·&nbsp;oſten a great ſhail* in the diſturbances which took place&nbsp;throughout the empire. Beſides theſe, Auguſtus con-,·&nbsp;fiant ly kept at ſea two powerful navies ; the one riding.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
