<p><span class="font2">We gave the name of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">weir</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bar</span><span class="font2"> to a dam erected across a river for the purpose of raising its waters, whether in order to take off a draft for a mill or to deepen the channel.&nbsp;Before we can tell the effect which they will produce, we&nbsp;must have a general rule for ascertaining the relation between the height of the water above the lip of the weir or&nbsp;bar, and the quantity of water which will flow over.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">First, then, with respect to a weir, represented in fig. 20 and fig. 21. The latter figure more resembles their usual</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2">form, consisting of a dam of solid masonry, or built of timber, properly fortified with shoars and banks. On the top is set up a strong plank FR, called the wasteboard or waster,&nbsp;over which the water flows. This is brought to an accurate level, of the proper height. Such voiders are frequently made in the side of a mill-course, for letting the&nbsp;superfluous water run off. This is properly the waster, or&nbsp;voider : it is also called an offset. The same observations will explain all these different pieces of practice. The&nbsp;following questions occur in course.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Prob. 1. Given the length of an offset or wasteboard made in the face of a reservoir of stagnant water, and the&nbsp;depth of its lip under the horizontal surface of the water,&nbsp;to determine the discharge, or the quantity of water which&nbsp;will run over, in a second.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let A B be the horizontal surface of the still water, and F the lip of the wasteboard. Call the depth BF under the&nbsp;surface </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h,</span><span class="font2"> and the length of the wasteboard </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">l.</span><span class="font2"> The water&nbsp;is supposed to flow over into another basin or channel, so&nbsp;much lower that the surface HL of the water is lower, or&nbsp;at least not higher, than F.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If the water could be supported at the height BF, BF might be considered as an orifice in the side of a vessel.&nbsp;In this case, the discharge would be the same as if the&nbsp;whole water were flowing witll the velocity acquired from&nbsp;the height ½BF, or ½A. And if we suppose that there is&nbsp;no contraction at the orifice, the mean velocity would be&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">V2g}<sub>j</sub>h, =</span><span class="font2"> √772 × ½Λ, in English inches, per second. The&nbsp;area of this orifice is </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lh.</span><span class="font2"> Therefore the discharge would&nbsp;be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">lh</span><span class="font2"> √772 × </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">½∕l, </span><span class="font2">all being measured in inches. This is the&nbsp;usual theory ; but it is not an exact representation of the&nbsp;manner in which the efflux really happens. The water&nbsp;cannot remain at the height BF ; but in drawing towards&nbsp;the wasteboard from all sides it forms a convex surface&nbsp;AIH, so that the point I, where the vertical drawn from&nbsp;the edge of the wasteboard meets the curve, is considerably&nbsp;lower than B. But as all the mass above F is supposed&nbsp;perfectly fluid, the pressure of the incumbent water is propagated, in the opinion of Du Buat, to the filament passing over at F without any diminution. The same may be&nbsp;said of any filament between F and I. Each tends, therefore, to move in the same manner as if it were really impelled through an orifice in its place. Therefore the motions&nbsp;through every part of the line or plane IF are the same&nbsp;as if the water were escaping through an orifice IF, made&nbsp;by a sluice let down on the water, and keeping up the water of the reservoir to the level AB. It is beyond a doubt,&nbsp;says he, that the height IF must depend on the whole&nbsp;height BF, and that there must be a certain determin&lt;&nbsp;proportion between them. He does not attempt to dete&nbsp;mine this proportion theoretically, but says that his exp&nbsp;riments ascertain it with great precision to be the propo&nbsp;tion of one to two, or that IF is always one half of BF. t&nbsp;says, however, that this determination was not by an imm&nbsp;diate and direct measurement ; he concluded it from tl&nbsp;comparison of the quantities of water discharged under di&nbsp;ferent heights of the water in the reservoir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We cannot help thinking that this reasoning is very d</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2"> fective in several particulars. It cannot be inferred, &quot;fro&nbsp;the laws of hydrostatical pressure, that the filament at I&nbsp;pressed forward with all the weight of the column BI. Tl&nbsp;particle I is really at the surface ; and considering it as mal&nbsp;ing part of the surface of a running stream, it is subject&lt;&nbsp;to hardly any pressure, any more than the particles on tl&nbsp;surface of a cup of water held in the hand, while it is carriι&nbsp;round the axis of the earth and round the sun. Reasonir&nbsp;according to his own principles, and availing himself of h&nbsp;own discovery, he should have said that the particle at I hi&nbsp;an accelerating force depending on its slope only ; and the&nbsp;he should have endeavoured to ascertain this slope. The m</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;tion of the particle at I has no immediate connection with tl&nbsp;extremely different from what it is ; for this pressure aloι&nbsp;would give it the velocity which Du Buat assigns it. Now&nbsp;would give it the velocity which M. de Buat assigns it. Now&nbsp;is already passing through the point I with the velocity whit&nbsp;it has acquired in descending along the curve AI ; and th&nbsp;is the real state of the case. The particles are passir&nbsp;through with a velocity already acquired by a sloping cui&nbsp;rent ; and they are accelerated by the hydrostatical pressui&nbsp;of the water above them. The internal mechanism of the;&nbsp;motions is infinitely more complex than Du Buat here su,&nbsp;poses ; and on this supposition, he very nearly abandons tl&nbsp;theory which he has so ingeniously established, and adop&nbsp;the theory of Guglielmini, which he had exploded. At tl&nbsp;same time, we think that he is not much mistaken when 1&nbsp;asserts that the motions are nearly the same as if a slui&lt;&nbsp;had been let down from the surface to I. For the filameι&nbsp;which passes at I has been gliding down a curved surfac&nbsp;and has not been exposed to any friction. It is perha,&nbsp;the very case of hydraulics where the obstructions are tl&nbsp;smallest ; and we should therefore expect that its motic&nbsp;will be least retarded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have therefore no hesitation in saying, that the fils ment at I is in the very state of motion which the theo&nbsp;would assign to it if it were passing under a sluice, as E&nbsp;Buat supposes. And with respect to the inferior filament&nbsp;without attempting the very difficult task of investigatir&nbsp;their motions, we shall just say, that we do not see any reι&nbsp;son for supposing that they will move slower than our auth</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;supposes. Therefore, though we reject his theory, we aι&nbsp;mit his experimental proposition in general ; that is, we </span><span class="font3">aι&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">mit that the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">whole</span><span class="font2"> water which passes through the plane I&nbsp;moves with the velocity (though not in the same directioι&nbsp;with which it would have run through a sluice of the san&nbsp;depth ; and we may proceed with his determination of tl&nbsp;quantity of w ater discharged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If we make BC the axis of a parabola BEGK, the velι cities of the filaments passing at I and F will be represen&nbsp;ed by the ordinates IE and FG, and the discharge by tl&nbsp;area IEGF. This allows a very neat solution of the prι&nbsp;blem. Let the quantity discharged per second be D, ar&nbsp;let the whole height BF be </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span><span class="font2"> Let 2G be the quantil&nbsp;by which we must divide the square of the mean velocil&nbsp;in order to have the producing height. This will be le&nbsp;than </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2g,</span><span class="font2"> the acceleration of gravity, on account of the coι&nbsp;vergency at the sides and the tendency to convergence ,&nbsp;the lip F. We formerly gave for its measure 702 inche&nbsp;instead of 772, and said that the inches discharged per s</span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;cond from an orifice of one inch were 26∙49, instead of 27∙7</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
