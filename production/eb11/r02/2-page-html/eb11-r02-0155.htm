<p><span class="font1">the quantity of air inspired at each breath, but also on the number of inspirations in a given time. If these two values&nbsp;he multiplied together we get what might be called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">volume&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of respiration </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Athmungsgrosse,</span><span class="font1"> Isidore Rosenthal, b. 1836),&nbsp;in contradistinction to depth of respiration and frequency of&nbsp;respiration. Various instruments have heen devised to&nbsp;measure the volume of respiration, all more or less faulty for&nbsp;the reason that they compel respiration under somewhat abnormal conditions (Rosenthal, Gad, Peter Ludwig, Panum&nbsp;(1820-1885), Ewald Hering (b. 1834). From the data obtained we may conclude that the respiratory volume per&nbsp;minute in man is about 366 cuh. in. (6000 cub. centim.).&nbsp;In connexion with this subject it may be stated that, after&nbsp;a single ordinary inspiration of hydrogen gas, 6-10 respirations&nbsp;of ordinary air must occur before the expired air ceases to&nbsp;contain some trace of hydrogen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Types of Respiration.—</span><span class="font1">The visible characters of respiration in man vary considerably according to age and sex. In men,&nbsp;while there is a moderate degree of upheaval of the chest,&nbsp;there is a considerable although not preponderating degree&nbsp;of excursion of the ahdominal walls. In women the chest&nbsp;movements are decidedly most marked, the excursion of the&nbsp;abdominal walls being comparatively small. Hence we may&nbsp;distinguish two types of respiration, the costal and the abdominal, according to the preponderance of movement of&nbsp;one or the other part of the body wall. In forced respiration&nbsp;the type is costal in both sexes, and so it is also in sleep. The&nbsp;cause of this difference between men and women has been&nbsp;variously ascribed </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1"> to constriction of the chest by corsets&nbsp;in women, (5) to a natural adaptation to the needs of childbearing in women, and (c) to the greater relative flexibility&nbsp;of the ribs in women permitting a wider displacement under&nbsp;the action of the inspiratory muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Certain Concomitants of Normal Respiration.—</span><span class="font1">If the ear be placed against the chest wall during ordinary respiration&nbsp;we can hear with every inspiration a sighing or rustling sound,&nbsp;called “ vesicular,” which is probably caused by the expansion&nbsp;of the air vesicles; and with every expiration a sound of a&nbsp;much softer sighing character. In children the inspiratory&nbsp;rustle is sharper and more pronounced than in adults. If a&nbsp;stethoscope be placed over the trachea, bronchi or larynx,&nbsp;so that the sounds generated there may be separately communicated to the ear, there is heard a harsh to-and-fro sound&nbsp;during inspiration and expiration which has received the&nbsp;name of “ bronchial.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In healthy hreathing the mouth should be closed and the ingoing current should all pass through the nose. When&nbsp;this happens the nostrils become slightly expanded with each&nbsp;inspiration, probably by the action of the M. dilatatores naris.&nbsp;In some people this movement is hardly perceptible unless&nbsp;breathing be heavy or laboured. As the air passes at the&nbsp;hack of the throat hehind the soft palate it causes the velum&nbsp;to wave very gently in the current; this is a purely passive&nbsp;movement. If we look at the glottis or opening into the larÿnx&nbsp;during respiration, as we may readily do with the help of a&nbsp;small mirror held at the back of the throat, we may notice&nbsp;that the glottis is wide open during inspiration and that it&nbsp;hecomes narrower by the approximation of the vocal chords&nbsp;during expiration. This alteration is produced by the action&nbsp;of the laryngeal muscles. Like the movements of the nostril,&nbsp;those of the larynx are almost imperceptible in some people&nbsp;during ordinary breathing, but are very well marked in all&nbsp;during forced respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Mechanics of Respiration.—</span><span class="font1">The thorax is practically a closed box entirely filled by the lungs, heart and other structures contained within it. If we were to freeze a dead body&nbsp;until ali its tissues were rigid, and then were to remove a&nbsp;portion of the chest wall, we should observe that every corner&nbsp;of the thorax is accurately filled by some portion or other&nbsp;of its contents. If we were to perform the same operation of&nbsp;removing a part of the chest wall in a body not first frozen&nbsp;we should find, on the other hand, that the contents of the&nbsp;thorax are not by any means in such circumstances bulky&nbsp;enough to fill up the space provided for them. If we were&nbsp;to measure the organs carefully we should find that those&nbsp;which are hollow and whose cavities communicate with the&nbsp;regions outside the thorax are all larger in the frozen corpse&nbsp;than in that which was not frozen. In other words, the organs&nbsp;in the thorax are distended somewhat in order that they may&nbsp;completely fill the chest cavity; and the nature of this curious&nbsp;and important condition may best be illustrated by the simple&nbsp;diagrams, figs. 7 and 8 </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(from </span><span class="font1">Hermann’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physiologie des</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Menschen),—</span><span class="font1">wdiere </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">t</span><span class="font1"> is the trachea, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span class="font1"> the lung, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">υ</span><span class="font1"> thc auricle of the heart, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">k</span><span class="font1"> the ventricle, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span class="font1"> an intercostal space with its&nbsp;flexible membranous covering. When the interior of the&nbsp;vessel is rendered vacuous by &quot;exhaustion through the tube&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">0,</span><span class="font1"> the walls of the lungs and heart are expanded until the&nbsp;limits of the containing vessel are accurately filled, while all&nbsp;flexible portions of the walls of the vessel (corresponding to&nbsp;the intercostal membranes and the diaphragm of the thorax)&nbsp;are sucked inwards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From this description it follow’s that the lungs, even when the thorax is most contracted, are constantly over-distended,&nbsp;and that, when the cause of this over-distension is removed,&nbsp;the lungs, being elastic, collapse. It further follows that&nbsp;if the thorax is dilated, the flexible hollow organs it contains&nbsp;must perforce be still more distended—a distension which in&nbsp;the case of the lungs is followed by an indrawing of air through&nbsp;the trachea in all cases where the trachea is open. Thus,&nbsp;as the act of respiration is primarily a dilatation of the thorax,&nbsp;the part played by the lungs is, as Galcn knew, a purely passive&nbsp;one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How is dilatation of the thorax effected? It has been pointed out that the rib-planes decline from the horizontal in two&nbsp;directions, viz. from hehind forwards, and from the anteroposterior mesial plane outwards; a glance at fig. 9 will make&nbsp;this double sloping clear to the reader. It has, moreover,&nbsp;been explained that the diaphragm arches upwards into the&nbsp;thorax in such a manner that the lateral parts of the arch&nbsp;are vertical and in contact with the inner face of the thoracic&nbsp;walls. This being the structure of the thorax, the enlargement of its cavity is brought about (1) by raising the rib-planes until they approach the horizontal, and (2) by depressing&nbsp;the diaphragm and making its rounded dome more cone-like&nbsp;in outline. A moment’s consideration will show how these&nbsp;actions enlarge the boundaries of the thorax, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1"> When the&nbsp;postero-anterior slope of the rib-planes is diminished by the&nbsp;raising of the anterior ends of the ribs, the whole sternum&nbsp;is thrust upwards and forwards, and the antero-posterior&nbsp;diameter of the thorax is increased, (δ) When the lateral&nbsp;slope of the rib-planes is diminished by the ribs being moved</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
