<p><span class="font1">army was above 50,000 ſtrong. General Clairfait bad joined him with 15,000 Auſtrians, and a conſiderable&nbsp;body of Heſſians, along with 20,000 French emigrants;&nbsp;amounting in all to 90,000 men. To oppoſe theſe,&nbsp;Dumourier had only j 7,000 men collected near the&nbsp;point from which thc enemy were approaching in&nbsp;I^uxemboulg. The French emigrants had given the&nbsp;duke of Brunſwick- ſuch an account of the diffracted&nbsp;ſtate of their own country, and of the pretended diſaf-fection of ail orders of men towards the ruling faction&nbsp;in Paris, tliat no reſiſtance of any importance was expected. when the combined troops, conſiſting either&nbsp;of ſteady Auſtrian or Hungarian battalions, or of tliofe&nbsp;well diſciplinecl Pruffians wliich the great Frederick&nbsp;had inured to the beſt military diſcipline, were reviewed&nbsp;in Germany before ſetting out on their march, it is&nbsp;faid that the ſpectators, among whom tlic French canſe&nbsp;was not unpopular, beheld them with anxiety and regret, and pitied the unhappy conntry againſt which&nbsp;this irreſiſtible force was directed. The ſoldiers and&nbsp;their officers regarded themſelves as departing for a&nbsp;hunting match, or an e-xcurſion of pleaſure ; and many&nbsp;of the uſual accommodations of an army were ill attended to, ſuch as hoſpitals, &amp;c. The beginning of their&nbsp;progreſs into France juſtiſied theſe expectations. Long-wy ſurrendered after a ſiege of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">15</span><span class="font1"> hours, although well&nbsp;fortified, poffeffed of a garrifon of 3500 men, and defended by 71 pieces of cannon. The news of this&nbsp;event irritated the aſſembly fo much, that they decreed;&nbsp;that, when retaken, the houſes of the citizens ſhonld&nbsp;be razed to the ground ; and,, diſtruftful of the officers&nbsp;of the army, they decreed that the municipal officers of&nbsp;a town ſhould hereafter have power to controul the de-liberations of the- council of war. Verdun was next&nbsp;ſummoned ; and here the municipality compelled the&nbsp;governor M. Bèaurepiare to ſurrender. That officer,&nbsp;diſappointed and enraged, ſhot himſelf dead with a pi-ſtol in preſence of the council, and on the 2d of Sep-tember the Pruffian troops entered the town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The news of this ſecond capture, and of the ap-p-roach of the Pruffians, fpread an ſuſſant alarm through Paris. It was propoſed to raiſe a volunteer&nbsp;army, which ſhould ſet out immediately to meet the&nbsp;enemy. The -common council, which was now led by&nbsp;Robefpierre, Danton, Marat, and others of the moſt&nbsp;ſanguinary character, ordered the alarm-guns to be fired,&nbsp;and the populace to be ſummoned- to meet in the&nbsp;Champ de Mars to enroll themſelves to march againſt&nbsp;the enemy. The people aſſembled, and either in conſequence of a premeditated plan, or, which is not very&nbsp;probable, of an inſtantaneous movement, a number of&nbsp;voices exclaimed, that &quot; the domeſtic foes of the na-tion ought to be deſtroyed before its foreign enemies&nbsp;were attacked.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Parties of armed men proceeded without delay to the priſons where the non-juring clergy, the Swiſs offi-cers, and thoſe confined ſince the 10th of Auguſt on&nbsp;account of practices againſt the ſtate, were detained in&nbsp;cuſtody. They took out the priſoners one by one,&nbsp;gave them a kind of mock trial before a jury of them-ſelves, acquitted ſome few, and murdered the reft. A-mong theſe laſt was the princeſs de Lamballe. She&nbsp;was taken from her bed before this bloody tribunal, and&nbsp;maffacred; her head was carried by the populace to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Temple, to be ſeen by the queen, whoſe </span><span class="font1">friend </span><span class="font0">ſhe was.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">Thefe maſſacrcs laſted for two days, and upwards </span><span class="font0">oſ </span><span class="font1">1000 perfons were put to death. There is ſcarce any&nbsp;thing in hiſtory that can be repreſented as parallel to&nbsp;them ; they were committed, it is ſaid, by lefs than&nbsp;300 men, in the midſt of an immenſe city, which&nbsp;heard of them with horror, and in the vicinity of thc&nbsp;national affembly, which, by going in a body, could&nbsp;have put an end to them. But ſuch was the confuſion&nbsp;and diſmay of theſe two diſgraceſul days, that no man&nbsp;dared to ſtir ſrom his own houſe ; and every one belie-ved that the whole city, excepting his own ſtreet, was&nbsp;engaged in maffacre and bloodſhed. The national&nbsp;guards were all ready at their reſpective poſts, but no&nbsp;man directed them to act : and there is too much reaſon· to ſuſpect that Santerre and the chiefs of the com-mune connived, at leaſt, at the tranſaction.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, general Dumourier was taking the beſt meafures to protract the march of the enemy&nbsp;till the army of Kellerman, conſiſting of 20,000 men,&nbsp;could join him from Lorraine, and that of Bournonville&nbsp;from Flanders, amounting to 13,000; together with&nbsp;whatever new levies Luckner might be able to ſend&nbsp;him from Chalons. The foreſt of Argonne extends&nbsp;from north to ſouth upwards of 40 miles ; it lay direct-ly in the route of the duke of Brunſwick, who muſt&nbsp;either force his way acroſs it, or make a circuit of 40&nbsp;miles by the paſs of Grandpré on the north, or by Bar-leduc on tbe ſouth. The paſs that lay directly in his&nbsp;route was that of Bieſme. After ſurveying Dillon’s&nbsp;poſition here, he left a party of 20,000 men to watch&nbsp;it ; and with the main body of his army took the cir-cuitous rout by Grandpré on the north. Here Du-mourier waited to receive him, and was attacked on the&nbsp;12th and 13th without ſucceſs: but on the 14th, the&nbsp;attack of the Pruffians was irreſiſtible, and Dumourier&nbsp;retreating, gave up the paſs. On his march he was ſo&nbsp;violently preffed by the advanced cavalry of the Pruſ-ſians, that his army, at one time, was ſeized with a pa*&nbsp;nic, and fled before 1500 men ; who, if they had puſh-ed their advantage, might have diſperſed it. On the&nbsp;15th, however, Dumourier encamped at St Menehould,&nbsp;and began to fortify it. Bournonville’s army joined&nbsp;Dumourier on the 17th. The duke ef Brunſwick&nbsp;formed a plan of attacking Kellerman before his junc-tion could be completed. That general arrived on the&nbsp;19th within a mile of Dumourier’s camp ; the project-ed attack took place ; the Pruffians, manoeuvred- with&nbsp;thcir ufual coolneſs and addreſs ; they attempted to&nbsp;ſurround Kellerman’s army, but this could not be ac-compliſhed. The French troops- preſerved excellent&nbsp;order, while the national vivacity was conſtantly ſhowing itſelf in their ſhouts and patriotic ſongs : 40O&nbsp;French were killed, and 500 wounded ; the lofs of&nbsp;the Pruffians was much greater : and,, in the face of&nbsp;the enemy, Kellerman joined Dumourier at the end of&nbsp;the engagement without oppoſition. At the time that&nbsp;the attack was made on the army of Kellerman, an at-tempt was made to force Dillon’s camp at Bieſme by&nbsp;the 20,000 men that had been left in its vicinity, but&nbsp;without ſucceſs ; and this large detachment was thus&nbsp;prevented from croffing the foreſt of Argonne and join-ing the dnke of Brunſwick. It is to be obſerved, that</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">. in theſe engagements the French owed their ſuperiority chiefly to the excellence of their artillery ; </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">circum-</span><span class="font0">ftance which ſerved to convince their enemies that they</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
