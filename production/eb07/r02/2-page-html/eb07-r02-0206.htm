<p><span class="font1">HL parallel to GD, GA, and draw the line KL, which will be horizontal when the two sides of the roof have the same&nbsp;slope. Then ML measured on the same scale will give&nbsp;the horizontal thrust, by which the strength of the tie-beam&nbsp;is to be regulated. GL will give the thrust which tends to&nbsp;crush the rafters, and LM will also give the force which&nbsp;tends to crush the strut-beam BC.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In like manner, to find the strain of the king-post BD of fig. 17, consider that each brace is pressed by half the&nbsp;weight of the roofing laid on BA or BC, and this pressure,&nbsp;or at least its hurtful effect, is diminished in the proportion of BA to DA, because the action of gravity is vertical,&nbsp;and the effect which we want to counteract by the braces&nbsp;is in a direction Ee perpendicular to BA or BC. But as&nbsp;this is to be resisted by the brace </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">f</span><span class="font1">E acting in the direction ∕E, we must drawee perpendicular to Ee, and suppose the strain augmented in the proportion of Ee to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ef.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Having thus obtained in tons, pounds, or other measures, the strains which must be balanced at /by the cohesion of&nbsp;the king-post, take this measure from the scale of equal&nbsp;parts, and set it off in the directions of thc braces to G&nbsp;and H, and complete the parallelogram G/H K ; and∕K&nbsp;measured on the same scale will be the strain on the kingpost.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The artist may then examine the strength of his truss upon this principle, that every square inch of oak will bear&nbsp;at an average 7000 pounds compressing or stretching it,&nbsp;and may be safely loaded with 3500 for any length of time ;&nbsp;and that a square inch of fir will in like manner securely&nbsp;bear 2500. And, because straps are used to resist some&nbsp;of these strains, a square inch of well-wrought tough iron&nbsp;may be safely strained by 50,000 pounds. But the artist&nbsp;will always recollect, that we cannot have the same confidence in iron as in timber. The faults of this last are much&nbsp;more easily perceived ; and when the timber is too weak,&nbsp;it gives us warning of its failure by yielding sensibly before it breaks. This is not the case with iron ; and much&nbsp;of its service depends on the honesty of the blacksmith.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In this way may any design of a roof be examined. We shall here give the reader a sketch of two or three trussed&nbsp;roofs, which have been executed in the chief varieties of&nbsp;circumstances which occur in common practice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fig. 22 is the roof of St Paul’s Church, Covent Garden,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">London, the work of Inigo Jones. Its construction is singular. The roof extends to a considerable distance beyond the building, and the ends of the tie-beams support the&nbsp;Tuscan corniche, appearing like the mutules of the Doric&nbsp;order. Such a roof could not rest on the tie-beam. Inigo&nbsp;Jones has therefore supported it by a truss below it ; and&nbsp;the height has allowed him to make this extremely strong&nbsp;with very little timber. It is accounted the highest roof of&nbsp;its width in London. But this was not difficult, by reason&nbsp;of the great height which its extreme width allowed him to&nbsp;employ without hurting the beauty of it by too high a&nbsp;pitch. The supports, however, are disposed with judgment.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fig. 23 is a kirb or mansarde roof by Price, and supposed to be of large dimensions,&nbsp;having braces to carry the&nbsp;middle of the rafters. It&nbsp;will serve exceedingly well&nbsp;for a church having pillars. The middle part of&nbsp;the tie-beam being taken&nbsp;away, the strains are very&nbsp;well balanced, so that there&nbsp;is no risk of its pushing&nbsp;aside the pillar on which it&nbsp;rests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fig. 24 is the celebrated roof of the Theatre of the University of Oxford, by Sir Christopher Wren. The span between the walls is 75 feet. This is accounted a very ingenious, and is a singular performance. The middle part of it is almost unchangeable in its form ; but from this circumstance it does not distribute the horizontal thrust with&nbsp;the same regularity as the usual construction. The horizontal thrust on the tie-beam is about twice the weight of&nbsp;the roof, and is withstood by an iron strap below the beam,&nbsp;which stretches the whole width of the building in the&nbsp;form of a rope, making part of the ornament of the ceiling.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In all the roofs which we have considered hitherto, the thrust is discharged entirely from the walls by the tie-beam.&nbsp;But this cannot always be done. We frequently want great&nbsp;elevation within, and arched ceilings. In such cases, it is&nbsp;a much more difficult matter to keep the walls free of all&nbsp;pressure outwards, and there are few buildings where it is&nbsp;completely done. Yet this is the greatest fault of a roof.&nbsp;We shall just point out the methods which may be most&nbsp;successfully adopted.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">We have said that a tie-beam just performs tile office of a string. We have said the same of the king-post.&nbsp;Now suppose two rafters AB, BC (fig. 25), moveable&nbsp;about the point B, and rest</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ing on the top of the walls. If</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the line BD be suspended</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">from B, and the two lines</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">DA, DC be fastened to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">feet of the rafters, and if these</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">lines be incapable of exten</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">sion, it is plain that all thrust</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">is removed from the walls as</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">effectually as by a common</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">tie-beam ; and by shortening</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">BD to B</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font1">, we gain a greater inside height, and more room for an arched ceiling. Now if we substitute a king-post&nbsp;BD (fig. 26), and two stretch</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ers or hammer-beams DA, DC</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">for the other strings, and con</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">nect them firmly by means</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">of iron straps, we obtain our</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let us compare this roof with a tie-beam roof in pomt of strain and strength. Recur to fig. 25, and complete the&nbsp;parallelogram ABCF, and draw the diagonals AC, BF,&nbsp;crossing in E. Draw BG perpendicular to CD. We have</span></p><div>
