And this is, firſt and principally, to the payment of the intereſt of the national debt. See <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps">NÀtionai Debt</hi></hi>  and Funds.</p><p>The reſpective produces of the ſeveral taxes were originally ſeparate and diſtinct funds ; being ſecurities for the ſums advanced on each ſeveral tax, and for them only. But at laſt it became neceſſary, in order to avoid confuſion, as they multiplied yearly, to reduce the number of theſe ſeparate funds, by uniting and blending them together ; fuperadding the faith of parliament for the general ſecurity of the whole. So that there are now only three capital funds of any account, the <hi rend="italic">aggregate</hi>  fund, and the <hi rend="italic">general</hi>  fund, ſo called from ſuch union and. addition ; and the <hi rend="italic">South-Sea</hi>  fund, being the produce of the taxes appropriated to pay the intereſt of ſuch part of the national debt as was advanced by that company and its annuitants, whereby the ſeparate funds, which were thus united, are become mutual ſecurities for each other; and the whole produce of them, thus aggregated, liable to pay ſuch intereſt or annuities as were formerly charged upon each diſtinct fund : the faith of the legiſlature being moreover engaged to ſupply any caſual deficiencies.</p><p>The cuſtoms, exciſes, and other taxes, which are to ſupport theſe funds, depending on contingencies, upon exports, imports, and conſumptions, muſt neceſſarily be of a very uncertain amount ; but they have always been conſiderably more than was ſufficient to anſwer the charge upon them. The ſurpluſſes, therefore, of the three great national funds, the aggregate, general, and Boutlι-Sea funds, over and above the intereſt and annuities charged upon them, are directed by ſtatute 3 Geo. I. c. 7- to be carried together, and to attend the difpoſition of parliament ; and are uſually denominated <hi rend="italic">Ùscfinking fund,</hi>  becauſe originally deſtined to fink and lower the national debt. To this have been ſince added many other entire duties, granted in fubſequent years ; and the annual intereſt of the ſums borrowed on their refpective credits is charged on, and payable out of, the produce of the ſinking fund. However, the nett ſurpluſſes and ſavings, after all deductions paid, amount annually to a very conſiderable fum. For as the intereſt on the national debt has been at ſeveral times reduced (by the conſent of the proprietors, who had their option either to lower their intereſt or be paid their principal), the ſavings from the appropriated revenues muſt needs be extremely large.</p><p>But, before any part of the aggregate fund (the ſurpluſſes whereof are one of the chief ingredients that form the ſinking fund) can be applied to diminiſh the principal of the public debt, it ſtands mortgaged by parliament to raiſe an annual ſum for the maintenance 'of the king’s houſchold and the civil liſt. For this purpoſe, in the late reigns, the produce of certain branches of the exciſe and cuſtoms, the poſt-office, the duty on wine-licences, the revenues of the remaining crown-lands, the profits ariſing from courts of juſtice, (which articles include all the hereditary revenues of the crown), and alſo a clear annuity of L. 120,000 in money, were fettled on the king for life, for the ſupport of his majeſty’s houſehold, and the honour and dignity of the crown. And, as the amount of theſe ſeveral branches was uncertain, (though in the laſt reign they were computed to have⅛bmetimes raiſed almoſt a million), if they did not ariſe annually to L. 800,000, the parliament engaged to make up the deficiency. But his preſent majeſty having, fυoα after his acceffion, ſpon-taneouſly ſignified his conſent that his own hereditary revenues might be ſo diſpoſed of as might beſt conduce to the utility and fatisfaction of the public, and having graciouſly accepted a limited fum, the ſaid hereditary and other revenues are now carried into, and made a part of, the aggregate fund ; and the aggregate fund is charged with the payment of the whole annuity to the crown. The limited annuity accepted by his pre-ſent majeſty was at firſt L. 800,000, but it has been ſince augmented to L. 900,000. The expences them-felves, being put under the ſame care and management as the other branches of the public patrimony, produce more, and are better collected than heretofore ; and the public is a gainer of upwards of L. 100,000 <hi rend="italic">per annum </hi>by this diſintereſted bounty of his majeſty.</p><p>I he finking fund, though long talked of as the laſt reſource of the nation, proved very inadequate to the purpoſe for which it was eſtabliſhed. Miniſters found pretences for diverting it into other channels ; and the diminution of the national debt proceeded ſlowly during the intervals of peace, whilſt each ſucceeding war increaſed it with great rapidity. To remedy this evil, and reſtore the public credit, to which the late war had given a conſiderable ſhock, Mr Pitt conceived a plan for diminiſhing the debt by a fund, which ſhould be rendered unalienable to any other purpoſe. In the feffion 1786, he moved that the annual ſurplus of the revenue above the expenditure ſhould be raiſed, by additional taxes, ſrom L. 900,000 to one million Sterling, and that cer* tain commiſſioners ſhould be veiled with the full power of difpoſing of this fum in the purchaſe of ſtock (ſee Funds), for the public, in their own names. Theſe commiſſioners ſhould receive the annual million by quarterly payments of L. 250,000, to be iſſued out of the exchequer before any other money, except the intereſt of the national debt itſelf ; by theſe proviſions, the fund would be ſecured, and no deficiencies in the na-tional revenues could affect it, but ſuch muſt be fepa~ rately provided for by parliament.</p><p>The accumulated compound intereſt on a million yearly, together with the annuities that would fall into that fund, would, he ſaid, in 28 years amount to ſuch a ſum as would leave a furplus of four millions annually, to be applied, if neceſſary, to the exigencies of the ſtate. In appointing the commiſſioners, he ſhould, he faid, endeavour to choofe perſons of ſuch weight and ' character as correſponded with the importance of the commiſſion they were to execute. The fpeaker of the houfe of commons, the chancellor of the exchequer, the maſter of the rolls, the governor and deputy governor of the bank of England, and the accountant-general of the high court of chancery, were perſons who, from their feveral ſituations, he ſhould think highly proper to be of the number.</p><p>To the principle of this bill no objection was madej though ſeveral ſpecious but ill-founded ones were urged againſt the ſufficiency of the mode which the chancellor of the exchequer had adopted for the accompliſhment. of fo great and ſo deſirable an end. He had made it a clauſe in his bill, that the accumulating million ſhould never be applied but to the purchaſe of ſtock. To this clauſe Mr Fox objected, and moved that the commit-</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
