The calyptra is caducous. The female ſtar grows on a ſeparate ſtera. There are six ſpecies, the rubrum, luteum, sphæricum, ampullaceum, vaſculoſum, anguſtatum. Two of theſe are natives of Britain.</p><p>1. The <hi rend="italic">ampullaceum,</hi> or crewet ſplachnum, is found in bogs and marſhes, and often upon cow-dung. It grows in thick tufts, and is about two inches high. The leaves are oval lanceolate, terminated with a long point or beard. The top of the filament or peduncle ſwells into the form of an inverted cone, which Linnæus terms an <hi rend="italic">apοphysis</hi> or <hi rend="italic">umbraculum ;</hi> upon the top of which is placed a cylindrical anthera, like the neck of a crewet. The calyptra is conical, and reſembles a ſmall extinguiſher.</p><p>2. The <hi rend="italic">vaſculoſum,</hi> or acorn-ſhaped ſplachnum, is found upon bogs and cow-dung, and upon the points of<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0714.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s05-0708"/>
rocks on the top of the Highland mountains, as on Ben-Lomond, and in the Iſle of Sky, and elſewhere. This differs little from the preceding, and perhaps is no more than a variety. The filaments are about an inch high. The leaves oval-acute, not ſo lanceolate and bearded as the other. The apophyſis, and the anthera at the top of it, form together nearly an oval figure, not unlike an acorn in its cup, the apophyſis being tranlverſely ſemi-oval, and of a blood-red colour, the anthera ſhort and conical. The calyptra is the ſame as that of the other. The operculum is ſhort and obtuse, and the rim of the anthera has eight large horizontal cilia. The anthera of the other is alſo ciliated, but not ſo diſtinctly. It is an elegant moſs, and very diſtinguiſhable on account of its orange-coloured filaments and dark-red capſules.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
