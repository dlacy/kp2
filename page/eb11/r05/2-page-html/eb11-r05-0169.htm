<p><span class="font2">literature may be closed. He was tutor to the tsar Feodor, son of Alexis, and may be said to have helped to introduce the culture of the West into Russia, as he was educated&nbsp;at Kiev, then a portion of Polish territory. Polotzki came&nbsp;to Moscow about 1664. He wrote religious works </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Vienets&nbsp;Viery, “</span><span class="font2"> The Garland of Faith ”), and composed poems and&nbsp;religious dramas </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(The Prodigal Son, Nebuchadnezzar,</span><span class="font2"> &amp;c.).&nbsp;He has left us some droll verses on the tsar’s new palace of&nbsp;Kolomenskoe, which are very curious doggerel. The artificial&nbsp;lions that roared, moved their eyes, and walked especially&nbsp;delighted him. There does not seem to be any ground for the&nbsp;assertion (often met with even in Russian writers) that Sept®.,&nbsp;the sister of Peter the Great, was acquainted with French, and&nbsp;translated some of the plays of Molière.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And now all things were to be changed. Russia was to adopt the forms of literature in use in the West. One of the&nbsp;chief helpers of Peter the Great in the education of&nbsp;the people was Feofane (Theophanes) Procopovich&nbsp;(1681-1736), author of the Ecclesiastical Regulations&nbsp;and some plays, who advocated the cause of science ;&nbsp;the old school was defended by Stephen Yavorskiy (1658-1722),&nbsp;whose </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rock of Faith</span><span class="font2"> was written to refute the Lutherans and&nbsp;Calvinists. Another remarkable writer of the times of Peter&nbsp;the Great was Pososhkov (b. 1673), a peasant by birth, who&nbsp;produced a valuable work on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Poverty and Riches.</span><span class="font2"> Antiokh&nbsp;Kantemir (1708-1744), son of a former hospodar of Moldavia,&nbsp;wrote some clever satires still read; they are imitated from&nbsp;Boileau. He also translated parts of Horace. Besides his&nbsp;satires, he published versions of Fontenelle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pluralité des&nbsp;Mondes</span><span class="font2"> and the histories of Justin and Cornelius Nepos. He&nbsp;was for some time Russian ambassador at the courts of London&nbsp;and Paris. But more celebrated than these men was&nbsp;Michael Lomonosov (ç.v.). He was an indefatigable&nbsp;writer of verse and prose, and has left odes, tragedies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">didactic poetry, essays and fragments of epics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Vassilii Tatistchev (1686-1750) was the author of a Russian history which is interesting as the first attempt in that field. He was disgraced for peculation, and died at Astrakhan, as governor, in 1750.&nbsp;His work was not given to the world till after his death. There had&nbsp;been a slight sketch published before by Khilkov, entitled the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marrow&nbsp;of Russian History.</span><span class="font1"> Basil Trediakovski (1703-1769) was&nbsp;born at Astrakhan, and we are told that Peter, passing&nbsp;through that city at the time of his Persian expedition,&nbsp;had Trediakovski pointed out to him as one of the most promising&nbsp;boys of the school there. Whereupon, having questioned him, the&nbsp;tsar said, with truly prophetic insight, “ A busy worker, but master&nbsp;of nothing.” His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Telemakhida,</span><span class="font1"> a poem in which he versified the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Télémaque</span><span class="font1"> of Fénelon, drew upon him the derision of the wits of&nbsp;the time. He had frequently to.endure the rough horse-play of the&nbsp;courtiers, for the position of a literary man at that time in Russia&nbsp;was not altogether a cheerful one. His services, however, to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russian language wvre great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the commencement of the reign of Elizabeth Russian literature made great progress, the French furnishing models.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Alexander Sumarokov (1718-1777) wrote prose and verse in . abundance-ycomedies, tragedies, idyls, satires and&nbsp;epigrams He is, perhaps, best entitled to remembrance&nbsp;for his plays, which are rhymed, and in the French style. His&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dmitri Samozvanets</span><span class="font1"> (“ Demetrius the Pretender ”) is certainly not&nbsp;without merit. Some of the pieces of Kniazhnin had&nbsp;great success in their time, such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Chatterbox, The&nbsp;Originals</span><span class="font1"> and especially </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Fatal Carriage.</span><span class="font1"> He is now&nbsp;almost forgotten. In 1756 the first theatre was opened at St&nbsp;Petersburg, the director being Sumarokov. Up to this time the&nbsp;Russians had acted only religious plays, such as those written by&nbsp;Simeon Polotzki. The reign of Catherine II. (1762-96), herself a&nbsp;voluminous writer, saw the rise of a whole generation of court poets.&nbsp;Everything in Russia was to be forced like plants in a hot-house;&nbsp;she was to have Homers, Pindars, Horaces and Virgils. Michael&nbsp;Kheraskov (1733-1807) wrote besides other poems two&nbsp;enormous epics—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rossiada</span><span class="font1"> in twelve books, and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vladimir</span><span class="font1"> in eighteen; they are now but little read.&nbsp;Hippolitus Bogdanovich (1743-1803) wrote a pretty lyric&nbsp;piece, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dushenka,</span><span class="font1"> based upon La Fontaine, ana telling the&nbsp;old story of the loves of Cupid and Psyche. With Ivan&nbsp;Khemnitzer begins the long list of fabulists; this halforiental form of literature, so common in countries ruled&nbsp;absolutely, has been very popular in Russia. Khemnitzer</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1744-1784), whose name seems to imply a German origin, began by translating the fables of Gellert, but afterwards produced original&nbsp;specimens. A writer of real national comedy appeared in Denis&nbsp;von Visin, probably of German extraction, but born&nbsp;at Moscow (1744-1792). His best production is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nedorosl&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(“ The Minor ”), in which he satirizes the coarse features of Russian&nbsp;society, the ill-treatment of the serfs, and other matters. He saw&nbsp;France on.the eve of the great Revolution, and has well described&nbsp;what he did see. Russian as he was, and accustomed to serfdom,&nbsp;he was yet astonished at the wretched condition of the French&nbsp;peasants. The great poet of the age of Catherine, the laureate of&nbsp;her glories, was Gabriel Derzhavin (1743-1816). He&nbsp;essayed many styles </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">composition, ana was a great&nbsp;master of his native language. There is something&nbsp;grandiose, and organ-like in his high-sounding verses; unfortunately&nbsp;he occasionally degenerates into bombast... His versification is&nbsp;perfect; and he had the courage to write satirically of many persons&nbsp;of high rank. His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ode to God</span><span class="font1"> is the best known of his poems in&nbsp;Western countries. He was a student of Ossian, and of Edward&nbsp;Young, the author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Night Thoughts.</span><span class="font1"> Other celebrated poems&nbsp;of Derzhavin are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Felitza,^ Odes on the Death of Prince Mestcherskiy,&nbsp;The Nobleman, The Taking of Ismail,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Taking of Warsaw.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">His Memoirs were published in 1857.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An unfortunate author of the days of Catherine was Alexander Radistehev (1749-1802), who, having, in a small work, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Journey&nbsp;to St Petersburg and Moscow,</span><span class="font1"> spoken too severely of the&nbsp;miserable condition of the serfs, was punished by banishment to Siberia, from which he was afterwards allowed to&nbsp;return, but not till his health had been permanently injured by&nbsp;his sufferings. An equally sad fate befell the spirited writer Nicholas&nbsp;Novikov (1744-1818), who, after having work«! hard as a&nbsp;journalist, and done much for education in Russia, fell .&nbsp;under the suspicion of the government, and was imprisoned by&nbsp;Catherine. On her death he was released by her successor. The&nbsp;short reign of Paul was not favourable to literary production; the&nbsp;censorship of the press was extremely severe, ana many foreign&nbsp;books were excluded from Russia, t</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But a better state of things came with the reign of Alexander, one of the glories of whose day was Nicholai Karamzin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> His&nbsp;chief work is his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Russian Empire,</span><span class="font1"> but he&nbsp;appeared in the fourfold aspect of historian, novelist,&nbsp;essayist and poet. Nor need we do more than mention&nbsp;the celebrated Archbishop Platon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> Ivan Dmitriev&nbsp;(1760-1837) wrote some pleasing lyrics and epistles,&nbsp;but without much force. He appears from his translations to have been well acquainted with the English poets.&nbsp;Ozerov (1769-1816) wrote a great many tragedies, which&nbsp;are but little read now. They are in rhyming alexandrines. He occasionally handled native subjects with success,&nbsp;as in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dmitri Donskoy</span><span class="font1"> (1807) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Yaropolk and Oleg</span><span class="font1"> (1798).&nbsp;In Ivan Kriloff </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> the Russians found their most&nbsp;genial fabulist. As Derzhavin was the poet of the age&nbsp;of Catherine, so Vasilii Zhukovskiy (1783-1852) may be&nbsp;said to have been that of the age of Alexander. He is&nbsp;more remarkable, however, as </span><span class="font2">a </span><span class="font1">translator than as an original&nbsp;poet. With him Romanticism began in Russia. He became&nbsp;reader to the.empress and afterwards tutor to her children. In&nbsp;1802 he published his version of Gray’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elegy,</span><span class="font1"> which at once&nbsp;became a highly popular poem in Russia. Zhukovskiy translated&nbsp;many pieces from the German (Goethe, Schiller, Uhland) and&nbsp;English (Byron, Moore, Southey). One of his original productions, “The Poet in the Camp, of the Russian Warriors,” was on&nbsp;the lips of every one at. the time of the War of the. Fatherland&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Otechestvennaia Voina)</span><span class="font1"> in 1812. He produced versions of the&nbsp;episode </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">Nala and Damayanti from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mahabharata,</span><span class="font1"> of Rustum&nbsp;and Zohrab from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Shah-Namah,</span><span class="font1"> and of a part of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Odyssey.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">In the case of these, three masterpieces, however, he was obliged&nbsp;to work from literal translations (mostly German), as he was&nbsp;unacquainted with the original languages. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad</span><span class="font1"> was translated during this period by Gnedich,. who was familiar&nbsp;with Greek. He has produced a faithful, and spirited&nbsp;version, and has naturalized the hexameter in the Russian language&nbsp;with much skill. Constantine Batiushkov (1787-1855)&nbsp;was the author of many elegant poems, and at the outset&nbsp;of his career promised much, but sank into imbecility, and&nbsp;lived in this condition to an advanced age. Merzliakov and Tziganov&nbsp;deserve a passing notice as the writers of songs some of which&nbsp;still keep their popularity. During his short life (i799”<sup>I</sup>837)&nbsp;Alexander Pushkin produced many celebrated poems,&nbsp;which will be found enumerated in the article devoted&nbsp;to him (see Pushkin). In Alexander Griboyedov (1795-1829) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> the Russians saw the writer of one of their&nbsp;most clever comedies </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Gore ot Uma),</span><span class="font1"> which may perhaps.be translated “ The Misfortune of being Too Clever ” (lit. “ Grief out of&nbsp;Wit ”). Ivan Kozlov (1774-1838) was author of some&nbsp;pretty original lyrics, ana some translations from the&nbsp;English, among others Burns’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cottar's Saturday Night.</span><span class="font1"> He&nbsp;became a cripple and blind, and his misfortunes elicited some&nbsp;cheering and sympathetic lines from Pushkin, which will always&nbsp;be read with pleasure.</span></p>
