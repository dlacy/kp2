He served in the Roman army, but seems to have deserted, for we are told that he was taken prisoner and sold as a slave. Destined for the arena, he, with a band of his fellow-gladiators, broke out of a training-school at Capua and took refuge on Mount Vesuvius (73 b.c.). Here he maintained himself as a captain of brigands, his lieutenants being Crixus and Œnomaus, who like himself had been gladiators. Their numbers soon swelled through the accession of runaway slaves and desperados from the neighbourhood. A hastily-collected force of 3000 men under Claudius endeavoured to besiege and starve out the rebels, but the latter clambered down the precipices and put the Romans to flight. Swarms of hardy and desperate men now joined the rebels, and when the prætor Publius Varinius took the field against them he found them entrenched like a regular army on the plain. But they gave him the slip, and when he advanced to storm their lines he found them deserted. From Campania the rebels marched into Lucania, a country better suited for guerilla warfare. Here, in spite of the commands and entreaties of Spartacus, the slaves committed excesses of lust and cruelty. Varinius followed him, but was defeated in several engagements and narrowly escaped being taken prisoner. Spartacus, whose heart was “ where his rude cottage by the Danube lay,” now endeavoured to push northward. His object was to cross the Alps and allow the slaves, who were mostly Thracians, Germans, and Gauls, to disperse to their homes. But intoxicated by success his wild followers refused to listen to him ; their thoughts were all of plunder, and their track was marked by the devastation of Italy. Vola, Nuceria, Thurii, Metapontum, were sacked with every circumstance of savage cruelty. In this serious position of affairs the senate despatched both consuls against the rebels (72 b.c.). The German slaves under Crixus, who had separated from the rest, were defeated and cut in pieces at Mount Gargarus in Apulia by the prætor Arrius. But Spartacus overthrew both consuls, one after the other, and then pressed towards the Alps. Cassius, governor of Cisalpine Gaul, and the prætor Manlius flung themselves in his way at the head of 20,000 men, but were trampled under foot. Freedom was within sight, but with fatal infatuation the slaves declined to abandon Italy. Spartacus led them against Rome, but their hearts seem to have failed them, for the capital was not attacked. Spartacus then occupied the port of Thurii and tried to procure supplies of iron and bronze, probably through the pirates. He also endeavoured by means of the herds of horses captured in southern Italy to form a body of cavalry. The conduct of the war against Spartacus, together with eight legions, was now committed to the prætor Marcus Crassus. He restored discipline by decimating the first troops that ran before the enemy. In the next battle Spartacus was worsted and retreated towards the straits of Messina, intending to cross into Sicily, where he would have been welcomed by fresh hordes of slaves ; but the pirates who had agreed to transport his army proved faithless. Crassus endeavoured to shut in the rebels by carrying a ditch and rampart right across the peninsula, a distance of 32 miles. But on a wintry night Spartacus forced the lines, and once more Italy lay at his feet. Disunion, however, was at work in the rebel camp. The Gauls and Germans had again drawn off from the main body. Crassus attacked and destroyed them. Spartacus was now fain to secure a retreat into the mountains of Petelia (near Strongoli∙ in Calabria), and succeeded in inflicting a reverse on the pursuing army. But his men refused to retreat farther, and in a pitched battle which followed soon afterwards the rebel army was annihilated. Spartacus, who had stabbed his horse before the battle began, fell sword in hand. A body of the rebels which had escaped from the field was met and cut in pieces by Pompey, who, with his usual knack of reaping where other men had sowed, claimed and received the credit of having put an end to the war (71 b.c.). Six thousand slaves, who had not found a soldier’s death, were crucified along the high road from Capua to Rome.</p><p>A history of the war against Spartacus has to he pieced together with much uncertainty from the vague, scrappy, and somewhat discrepant accounts of Plutarch <hi rend="italic">{Crassus,</hi> 8-11), Appian (<hi rend="italic">Bell.
