<p><span class="font0">There is generally a superior zygomatic arcade formed by the junction of the postfrontal with the squamosal ; and,&nbsp;very generally, the orbit </span><span class="font1">is </span><span class="font0">enclosed posteriorly by a&nbsp;junction of this postfrontal with the malar. The basi-sphenoid sends down (as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria)</span><span class="font0"> two processes to abut&nbsp;against the pterygoids, which again join the quadrate&nbsp;bones. An os transversum unites the pterygoid, palatine,&nbsp;and maxilla of either side. The maxilla is thus a fixed&nbsp;bone ; the premaxilla is generally single, and sends a median&nbsp;process backwards. The nasals, frontale, and parietals&nbsp;may be single or double. There is generally a parietal&nbsp;fontanelle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By very rare exception, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Monopeltis,</span><span class="font0"> there may be two occipital condyles, that (median) portion which is&nbsp;formed from the basioccipital aborting.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The hyoid consists of two pairs of cornua, whereof the anterior is generally the longer, attached to a median&nbsp;portion from which azygous a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">bifold process may proceed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">both anteriorly and poste</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">riorly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the Amphisbænians the skull is more solidly and continuously ossified than is usual&nbsp;in Lizards, though there is&nbsp;no columella and though the&nbsp;low ali- and orbito-sphenoidal&nbsp;regions are membranous. The&nbsp;parietal is not movably articulated to the exoccipital, and&nbsp;the facial part is solidly ossified and not movable upon the&nbsp;hinder portion of the skull.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The orbits are not enclosed behind, and there is no superior&nbsp;zygomatic arcade.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The skull of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Heloderma</span><span class="font0"> is very remarkable in that it has&nbsp;no zygomatic arch whatever,&nbsp;and in that the pre- and postfrontal bones unite and exclude&nbsp;the frontal bone from the margin of the orbit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The skull of the Chamæleons has even more the aspect of an osseous scafffolding than has that of ordinary Lizards&nbsp;in spite of the absence of a columella. This is owing&nbsp;to the presence of a long supraoccipital arcade formed by&nbsp;a long posteriorly and inwardly extending process of the&nbsp;squamosal, which joins the adjacent side of the singularly&nbsp;prolonged and upwardly and backwardly extending process of the parietal,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which itself is solid</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ly united to an up</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">wardly extending</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">process of the supra-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">occipital. Thus the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">facial part of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">skull is not movable</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">upon its occipital</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">portion. The orbits</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">are enclosed by</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">bone, and there is a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">superior zygomatic</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">arcade, the post</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">frontal joining the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">squamosal behind</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and the malar in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">front. The frontal</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">bone is small and single. There are a pair of narrow nasals, but these do not form the boundary of any part of the anterior nares, but are excluded therefrom by the junction of&nbsp;the prefrontals with the maxilla, and these two bones may&nbsp;be prolonged so as to form great horn-like processes. The&nbsp;pterygoids do not articulate with the quadrates, and there&nbsp;is no interorbital septum. The hyoid has its posterior&nbsp;cornua much the longer, and a bony median basihyal. ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Ophidians, like the Lizards, have skulls which are formed on more than one type:—(1) those of the&nbsp;ordinary wide-mouthed Serpents ; and (2) those of the&nbsp;Serpents with a very narrow gape, such as we find, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uropeltis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The wide-mouthed Serpents, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eurystomata,</span><span class="font0"> have a skull which in some respects is much less completely&nbsp;ossified and more movable than in ordinary Lizards, while&nbsp;in other respects it is more ossified and less movable.&nbsp;Thus the lateral walls of the anterior parts of the cranial&nbsp;cavity are well ossified, so that the anterior part-of the&nbsp;skull is no longer movable on the occipital segment,&nbsp;while on the contrary the total absence of both zygomatic&nbsp;arcades, the non-union directly of the palatine with the&nbsp;vomer, the laxity of union of the premaxilla and maxilla,&nbsp;and especially the movable condition not only of the&nbsp;quadrate but also of the squamosal (often an elongated&nbsp;bone) from which it is suspended, all give an excessive&nbsp;mobility to the facial part of the skull. To this it may be&nbsp;added that, at the symphysis, the rami of the mandible&nbsp;are only united by soft, very extensible tissue. There&nbsp;is usually but one premaxilla, and that is edentulous. The&nbsp;palatines are usually connected with the maxilla by&nbsp;transverse bones, while the pterygoids connect them with&nbsp;the quadrate bones. There is no interorbital septum, and</span></p>
