one of the ſix mechanical powers. A fcrew is a cylinder cut into ſeveral concave ſurfaces, or rather a channel or groove made in a cylinder, by carrying on two ſpiral planes the whole length of the ſcrew, in ſuch a manner that they may be always equally inclined to the axis of the cylinder in their whole progreſs, and alſo inclined to the bale of it in the fame angle. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Mechanics,</hi> n 30</p><p>N <hi rend="superscript"> o</hi> l. To <hi rend="italic">construct a common, or one-threaded Screw.</hi> — Make a parallelogram of paper equal in length to the cylinder which is to be ſcrewed, and equal in breadth to the circumference of that cylinder. Divide the ſide of the parallelogram, which is equal to the circumference of the cylinder, into two equal parts. Divide the other ſide of the parallelogram, which is equal in length to the cylinder, into as many parts as the thickneſs or breadth of the intended thread will run over. Then join the ſecond point on the circumference ſide to the ſecond point on the length-ſide of the parallelogram, and ſo join all the ſucceeding points as you ſee in the figure.</p><p>N⁰ 2. <hi rend="italic">To make a four-threaded Screw, or that which is commonly uſed ſor the letter-preſs.—</hi> Make a parallel</p><p>ogram, as deſcribed before; divide that ſide which is equal to the circumference of the cylinder into eight equal parts, or twice the number of threads. Divide the other ſide into as many parts as the diſtance between two threads will run over, then join the points as in n⁰ 1. (fig. l).</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Corollary.</hi> <hi rend="italic">To make a left-handed ſcrew.</hi> —-Make the parallels to the right inſtead of the left, as expreſſed by the figures, n⁰ 3.</p><p>This is the true and only practicable way of making all kinds of ſcrews that are cut on a cylinder.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Archimedes's SCREW.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrostatics,</hi> n⁰40.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Endleſs</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Perpetual</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Screw,</hi> one ſo fitted in a corn- hound machine as to turn a dented wheel; ſo called, becauſe it may be turned for ever without coming to an end.</p><p>If in the endleſs or perpetual ſcrew, AB (n⁰ 4.), whole threads take the teeth of the wheel CD, you take the diſtance of two threads, according to the length of the axis AB; or the diſtance of two teeth in the wheel CD, in the direction of the circumference; and if a weight W act at the circumference of the wheel: then, if the power D be to the weight W, as that diſtance of the teeth or threads, to the length deſcribed by the power P in one revolution, the power and weight will be in equilibrio; becauſe in one revolution of P, the wheel DC, with the weight W, has moved only the diſtance of one tooth,</p></div></body></text></TEI>
