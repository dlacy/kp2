<p><span class="font0">Hindustan and the history of their uses among the native races. The results of these investigations appeared in an essay </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">On the&nbsp;Antiquity of Hindoo Medicine</span><span class="font0"> (1837). For nearly ten years&nbsp;he held the post of superintendent of the East India Company’s&nbsp;botanic garden in the Himalayas at Saharanpur. In 1837 he&nbsp;was appointed to the professorship of materia medica in King’s&nbsp;College, London, which he held till 1856. From 1838 onwards&nbsp;he conducted a special department of correspondence, relating&nbsp;to vegetable products, at the East India House, and at the&nbsp;time of his death he had just completed there an extensive and&nbsp;valuable museum of technical products from the East Indies.&nbsp;In 1851 he superintended the Indian department of the Great&nbsp;Exhibition. He died at Acton near London on the 2nd of&nbsp;January 1858.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The work on which his reputation chiefly rests is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Illustrations of the Botany and other branches of Natural History of the Himalaya&nbsp;Mountains, and of the Flora of Cashmere,</span><span class="font0"> in 2 vols. 4X0, begun in&nbsp;1839.

<p><span class="font0">ROYSTON, a market town in the Hitchin parliamentary division of Hertfordshire, England, close to the border of&nbsp;Cambridgeshire, 48 m. N. of London by the Cambridge branch&nbsp;of the Great Northern railway. Pop. of urban district (1901)&nbsp;3517. The church of St John the Baptist is mainly Early&nbsp;English. There are a market house, and institute with library&nbsp;and museum. Beneath a street in the town is a curious example&nbsp;of a hermit’s cave, excavated in the chalk, and containing rude&nbsp;carvings of the crucifixion and other sacred subjects. It was&nbsp;discovered in 1742. The town lies on the Roman Ermine&nbsp;Street, at the point where it strikes from the hills across the&nbsp;plain, and its straight course is deflected slightly W. Roman&nbsp;relics have been found, and several barrows and earth-mounds&nbsp;occur on the neighbouring hills. A monastery of Augustinian&nbsp;canons was founded here towards the close of the 12th century,&nbsp;but there are no remains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROYTON, an urban district of Lancashire, England, within the parliamentary borough of Oldham, 2 m. N. of Oldham on&nbsp;the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire railway. Though of early origin,&nbsp;it is, as a town, of wholly modern growth. The cotton&nbsp;manufacture is its chief industry. Pop. (1901) 14,881.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROZAS, JUAN MARTINEZ DE (1759-1813), the earliest leader in the Chilean struggle for independence, was born at&nbsp;Mendoza in 1759. In early life he was a professor of law, and&nbsp;of theology and philosophy at Santiago. He held the post of&nbsp;acting governor of Concepcion at one time, and was also colonel&nbsp;in a militia regiment. In 1808 he became secretary to the last&nbsp;Spanish governor, Francisco Antonio Carrasco, and used his&nbsp;position to prepare the nationalist movement that began in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1809. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After resigning his position as secretary, Rozas was&nbsp;mainly responsible for the resignation of the Spanish governor,&nbsp;and the formation of a national Junta on the 18th of September</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1810, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of which he was the real leader. Under his influence&nbsp;many reforms were initiated, freedom of trade was established,&nbsp;an army was organized and a national congress was called&nbsp;together in July 1811. But at the end of that year divisions&nbsp;began to arise between Rozas’ followers from Concepción&nbsp;and the men of Santiago; and a feud broke out between Rozas&nbsp;and José Miguel Carrera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font0"> who had secured control of&nbsp;Santiago. In 1812 Carrera succeeded in securing the banishment of his rival, who retired to Mendoza, where he died on the&nbsp;3rd of March 1813.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUABON </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Rhiwabon),</span><span class="font0"> a town of Denbighshire, N. Wales, in the E. parliamentary division, near the Shropshire border,&nbsp;5 m. S.W. of Wrexham, on the Great Western railway. Pop.&nbsp;(1901) 3248. It is situated on a small tributary of the Dee.&nbsp;The old Gothic church is thought by some to have been founded&nbsp;by Mabon, a brother of Llewelyn (13th c.), and has monuments&nbsp;to the Wynn family, by Nollekens and Rhysbrac, and to Dr&nbsp;D. Powel (d. 1598), translator into English of'Caradoc’s (of&nbsp;Llancarfan) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History of Wales.</span><span class="font0"> In the neighbourhood are&nbsp;collieries, engineering works, an iron foundry and chemical&nbsp;works, besides an extensive industry in glazed and other bricks.&nbsp;Near Ruabon is Cacrdden </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Caerddin),</span><span class="font0"> an ancient camp (village)&nbsp;surrounded by circular intrenchments, and Wynnstay, with&nbsp;an avenue of fine trees. Anciently the residence of Madoc&nbsp;ab Gruffyd Maelor (founder of Valle Crucis Abbey), it was&nbsp;called Wattstay, from Watt’s Dyke, an old rampart on the&nbsp;estate. It was named Wynnstay on its coming into possession&nbsp;of the Wynns (17th c.). Offa’s Dyke, near here, is 10 ft. high,&nbsp;and broad enough for two carriages abreast. Not far is Chirk&nbsp;Castle (supposed to have been built in 1013), besieged by Cromwell’s artillery: near it, in the Ceiriog valley, the defeat of&nbsp;Henry II. by Owen Gwynedd took place in 1165.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUBBER, Indiarubber or Caoutchouc (a word probably derived from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cahucha</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caucho</span><span class="font0"> the names in Ecuador and Peru respectively for rubber or the tree producing it),&nbsp;the chief constituent of the coagulated milky juice or latex&nbsp;furnished by a number of different trees, shrubs and vines.&nbsp;The latex of the best rubber plants furnishes from 20 to 50%&nbsp;of rubber. The latex is not to be confused with the sap&nbsp;of trees, on the circulation of which their nutrition depends.&nbsp;Though frequently occurring, it is not a universal feature of plant&nbsp;life, and does not appear to be necessary or even directly connected with the nutritive system of plants. Its exact function&nbsp;is not fully understood. Latex, though chiefly secreted in&nbsp;vessels or small sacs which reside in the cortical tissue between&nbsp;the outer bark and the wood is also found in the leaves and&nbsp;sometimes in the roots or bulbs. The trees and plants whose&nbsp;latices furnish caoutchouc in considerable quantity chiefly&nbsp;belong to the natural orders Euphorbiaceae, Urticaceae,&nbsp;Apocynaceae, Asclepiadaceae. The latex is usually obtained&nbsp;from the bark or stem by making an incision reaching almost&nbsp;to the wood when the milky fluid flows more or less readily&nbsp;from the laticiferous vessels. It is, like milk, an emulsion, and&nbsp;when examined with the microscope is seen to consist of numerous globules suspended in a watery fluid. On standing, some&nbsp;latices separate, more or less readily, into an upper layer&nbsp;resembling cream and consisting of the globules, and a lower&nbsp;watery layer. This separation can be rapidly effected with&nbsp;some latices by the use of a centrifugal machine, but this&nbsp;method has not yet been applied to any extent commercially.&nbsp;The globules which furnish the cream gradually pass on standing&nbsp;into solid caoutchouc, a process which is facilitated by rapid&nbsp;stirring, or by the addition of an acid or other chemical agent.&nbsp;If the latex is warmed or an acid, an alkali or astringent plant&nbsp;juice is added to it, “ coagulation ” usually takes place more&nbsp;or less readily, the caoutchouc separating in solid flakes or&nbsp;curds. The efficacy of heat or of an acid, an alkali or other&nbsp;agent in promoting coagulation depends on the character of the&nbsp;latex, and varies with that obtained from different plants. The&nbsp;watery fluid in which the globules are suspended holds certain&nbsp;proteids, carbohydrates and a small proportion of salts in solution. The latex exhibits a neutral, acid or alkaline reaction&nbsp;depending upon the plant from which it has been obtained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When exposed to air the latex gradually undergoes putrefactive changes accompanied by coagulation of the caoutchouc. The addition of a small quantity of ammonia or of formalin to some latices usually has the effect of preserving&nbsp;them for a considerable time. The nature of the coagulation is&nbsp;not yet completely understood. It has been compared with that&nbsp;of milk and of blood, which depend essentially on the coagulation or separation in curds of a proteid or albuminous substance,&nbsp;such as takes place when white of egg is warmed. There is,&nbsp;however, reason to believe that the coagulation of latex into&nbsp;rubber is not mainly of this character. The globules in the&nbsp;latex are liquid, and the phenomenon of coagulation would seem&nbsp;to consist in the passage of this liquid into solid caoutchouc&nbsp;through the kind of change known as polymerization or condensation, in which a liquid passes into solid without alteration</span></p>
