<p><span class="font2">REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL, THE </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(le tribunal révolutionnaire),</span><span class="font2"> a court which was instituted in Paris by the Convention during the French Revolution for the trial of political offenders,&nbsp;and became one of the most powerful engines of the Terror. The&nbsp;news of the failure of the French arms in Belgium gave rise in&nbsp;Paris to popular movements on the 9th and ioth of March 1793,&nbsp;and on the ioth of March, on the proposal of Danton, the&nbsp;Convention decreed that there should be established in Paris&nbsp;an extraordinary criminal tribunal, which received the official&nbsp;name of the Revolutionary Tribunal by a decree of the 29th of&nbsp;October 1793. It was composed of a jury, a public prosecutor,&nbsp;and two substitutes, all nominated by the Convention; and&nbsp;from its judgments there was no appeal. With M. J. A. Hermann&nbsp;as president and Fouquier-Tinville as public prosecutor, the&nbsp;tribunal terrorized the royalists, the refractory priests and all&nbsp;the actors in the counter-revolution. Soon, too, it came to&nbsp;be used for personal ends, particularly by Robespierre, who&nbsp;employed it for the condemnation of his adversaries. The&nbsp;excesses of the Revolutionary Tribunal increased with the&nbsp;growth of Robespierre’s ascendancy in the Committee of Public&nbsp;Safety; and on the ioth of June 1794 was promulgated, at his&nbsp;instigation, the infamous Law of 22 Prairial, which forbade&nbsp;prisoners to employ counsel for their defence, suppressed the&nbsp;hearing of witnesses and made death the sole penalty. Before&nbsp;22 Prairial the Revolutionary Tribunal had pronounced 1220&nbsp;death-sentences in thirteen months; during the forty-nine days&nbsp;between the passing of the law and the fall of Robespierre&nbsp;1376 persons were condemned, including many innocent&nbsp;victims. The lists of prisoners to be sent before the tribunal&nbsp;were prepared by a popular commission sitting at the museum,&nbsp;and signed, after revision, by&quot; the Committee of General&nbsp;Security and the Committee of Puhlic Safety jointly. Although&nbsp;Robespierre was the principal purveyor of the tribunal, we&nbsp;possess only one of these lists bearing his signature. The&nbsp;Revolutionary Tribunal was suppressed on the 31st of May&nbsp;1795. Among its most celebrated victims may be mentioned&nbsp;Marie Antoinette, the Hebertists, the Dantonists and several&nbsp;of the Girondists. Similar tribunals were also in operation in&nbsp;the provinces.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">REWA, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Riwa,</span><span class="font2"> a native state of Central India in the Bagel-khand agency. It is the only large state in Bagelkhand, and the second largest in Central India, having an area of about 13,000&nbsp;sq. m. It is bounded N. by the United Provinces, E. by Bengal&nbsp;and S. by the Central Provinces. On the W. it meets other&nbsp;petty states of Bagclkhand. Rewa is divided into two well-defined portions. The northern and smaller division is the&nbsp;plateau lying between the Kaimur range of hills and that&nbsp;portion of the Vindhyas known as Binjh, which overlook the&nbsp;valley of the Ganges. This plateau is for the most part cultivated and well peopled; rich harvests both of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">kharif</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rabi&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">crops are generally obtained. Water is plentiful, and the&nbsp;country is full of large tanks and reservoirs, which, however,&nbsp;are not used for irrigation purposes; the only system of wet&nbsp;cultivation which has any favour with the villagers is that of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bunds,</span><span class="font2"> or mounds of earth raised at the lower ends of sloping&nbsp;fields to retain the rain water for some time after the monsoon&nbsp;rains cease. The country to the S. of the Kaimur hills comprises by far the largest portion of the state; but here cultivation is restricted to the valley between the hills and the Sone&nbsp;river, and to a few isolated patches in scattered parts of the&nbsp;forest wastes. The principal river is the Sone, which flows&nbsp;through the state in a N.E. direction into Mirzapur district.&nbsp;Another important river is the Tons, but neither is navigable.&nbsp;The annual rainfall averages about 41 in. The population in&nbsp;1901 was 1,327,385, showing a decrease of 12% in the decade.&nbsp;Many of the inhabitants of the hilly tracts are Gonds and Kols.&nbsp;Estimated revenue, £200,000. The staple crops are rice,&nbsp;millets and wheat; but more than one-third of the area is&nbsp;covered with forests, yielding timber and lac.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The S. of the state is crossed by the branch of the Bengal-Nagpur railway from Bilaspur to Katni, which taps the Umaria coal-field.&nbsp;The state suffered from famine in 1896-97, and again to a less</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
