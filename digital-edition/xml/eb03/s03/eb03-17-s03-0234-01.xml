in natural hiſtory, the name of a genus of foſſils of the claſs of ſeptariæ; the characters of which are, That they are bodies of a duſky hue; divided, by ſepta or partitions of a ſparry matter, into ſeveral more or leſs regular portions; of a moderately firm texture; not giving fire with ſteel; but fermenting with acid menſtrua, and eaſily calcining. The ſeptariæ of this genus are of all others the moſt common, and are what have been known by the little expreſſive or miſtaken names of the waxen vein, or ludus Helmontii. We have many ſpecies of theſe bodies common among us. Of the whitiſh or browniſli, we have thirteen; of the yellowiſh five; and of the ferruginous ones four.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
