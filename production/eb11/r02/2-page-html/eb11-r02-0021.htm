<p><span class="font2">the emphasis upon the object of knowledge, “ I know </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">this</span><span class="font2"> we have the other sense of absoluteness of knowledge: it is an&nbsp;assertion that the knower knows the “ this,” whatever it may be,&nbsp;in its essence or as it truly is in itself. The phrase “ relativity&nbsp;of knowledge ” has therefore two meanings: </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font2"> that no&nbsp;portion of knowledge is absolute, but is always affected by its&nbsp;relations to other portions of knowledge; (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font2">) that what we know&nbsp;are not absolute things in themselves, but things conditioned in&nbsp;their quality by our channels of knowledge. Each of these&nbsp;two propositions must command assent as soon as uncritical&nbsp;ignorance gives place to philosophic reflection; but each may&nbsp;be exaggerated, indeed has currently been exaggerated, into&nbsp;falsity. The simplest experience—a single note struck upon the&nbsp;piano—would not be what it is to us but for its relation by&nbsp;contrast or comparison with other experiences. This is true;&nbsp;but we may easily exaggerate it into a falsehood by saying that&nbsp;a piece of experience is entirely constituted by its relation to&nbsp;other experiences. Such an extreme relativity, as advocated&nbsp;by T. H. Green in the first chapter of his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Prolegomena to Ethics,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">involves the absurdity that our whole experience is a tissue of&nbsp;relations with no points of attachment on which the relations&nbsp;depend. The only motive for advocating it is the prejudice of&nbsp;absolute idealism which would deny that sensation has any part&nbsp;whatever in the constitution of experience. As soon as we&nbsp;recognize the part of sensation, we have no reason to deny the&nbsp;common-sense position that each piece of experience has its&nbsp;own quality, which is modified indefinitely by the relations in&nbsp;which it stands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second sense of relativity, that which asserts the impossibility of knowing things except as conditioned by our perceptive faculties, is more important philosophically and has had a more&nbsp;interesting history. To apprehend it is really the first great&nbsp;step in philosophical education. The Unphilosophical person&nbsp;assumes that a tree as he sees it is identical with the tree as it is&nbsp;in itself and as it is for other percipient minds. Reflection&nbsp;shows that our apprehension of the tree is conditioned by the&nbsp;sense-organs with which we have been endowed, and that the&nbsp;apprehension of a blind man, and still more the apprehension&nbsp;of a dog or horse, is quite different from ours. What the tree is&nbsp;in itself—that is, for a perfect intelligence—we cannot know,&nbsp;any more than a dog or horse can know what the tree is for a&nbsp;human intelligence. So far the relativist is on sure ground;&nbsp;but from this truth is developed the paradox that the tree has&nbsp;no objective existence at all and consists entirely of the conscious&nbsp;states of the perceiver. Observe the parallelism of the two&nbsp;paradoxical forms of relativity: one says that things are&nbsp;relations with nothing that is related; the other says that things&nbsp;are perceptive conditions with nothing objective to which the&nbsp;conditions apply. Both make the given nothing and the work&nbsp;of the mind everything.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">To see the absurdity of the second paradox of relativity is easier than to refute it. If nothing exists but the conscious&nbsp;states of the perceiver, how does he come to think that there is&nbsp;an objective tree at all ? Why does he regard his conscious&nbsp;states as produced by an object? And how does he come to&nbsp;imagine that there are other minds than his own ? In short, this&nbsp;kind of relativity leads straight to what is generally known as&nbsp;“ the abyss of solipsism.” But, like all the great paradoxes&nbsp;of philosophy, it has its value in directing our attention to a&nbsp;vital, yet much neglected, element of experience. We cannot&nbsp;avoid solipsism </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font2"> so long as we neglect the element of force&nbsp;or power. If, as Hegel asserted, our experience is all knowledge,&nbsp;and if knowledge is indefinitely transformed by the conditions&nbsp;of knowing, then we are tempted to regard the object as superfluous, and to treat our innate conviction that knowledge has&nbsp;reference to objects as a delusion which philosophical reflection&nbsp;is destined to dispel. The remedy for the paradox is to recognize&nbsp;that the foundation for our belief in the existence of objects is&nbsp;the force which they exercise upon us and the resistance which&nbsp;they offer to our will. What the tree is in regard to its specific&nbsp;qualities depends on what faculties we have for perceiving it.&nbsp;But, whatever specific qualities it may have, it will still exist&nbsp;as an object, so long as it comes into dynamic relations with&nbsp;our minds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the history of thought the relativity of knowledge as just described begins with Descartes, the founder of modern philosophy:&nbsp;the characteristic of modern philosophy is that it lays more stress&nbsp;upon the subjective than upon the objective side of experience. It&nbsp;is a mistake to refer it back to the Greeks. The maxim of Protagoras,&nbsp;for example, “ Man is the measure of all things,” has a different&nbsp;purpose; it was meant to point to the truth that man rather than&nbsp;nature is the primary object of human study: it-is a doctrine of&nbsp;humanism rather than of relativism. To appreciate the relativistic&nbsp;doctrines we find in various thinkers we must take account of the&nbsp;use to. which they were put. By Descartes the principle was used&nbsp;as an instrument of scepticism, the beneficent scepticism of pulling&nbsp;down medieval philosophy to make room for modern science; by&nbsp;Berkeley it was used to combat the materialists; by Hume in the&nbsp;cause of scepticism once more against the intellectual dogmatists;&nbsp;by Kant to prepare a justification for a noumenal sphere to be&nbsp;apprehended.by faith; by J. S. Mill and Herbert Spencer to support&nbsp;their derivation of all our experience from sensation. It is in Miirs&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Examination of Sir William Hamilton’s Philosophy</span><span class="font1"> that the classical&nbsp;statement of the Relativity of Knowledge is to be found. The&nbsp;second chapter of that book sets forth the various forms of the&nbsp;doctrine with admirable lucidity and precision, and gives many&nbsp;references to other writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the sake of clearness it seems desirable to keep for the future the term “ relativity of knowledge ” to the first meaning explained&nbsp;above: for the second meaning it has been superseded in contemporary philosophizing by the terms “ subjectivism,” ” subjective&nbsp;idealism,” and, for its extreme form, “ solipsism ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> (H. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">St.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RELEASE (O.Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reles,</span><span class="font2"> variant of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">relais,</span><span class="font2"> from </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rdaisser,</span><span class="font2"> to release, let go, Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">relaxare),</span><span class="font2"> freedom or deliverance from&nbsp;trouble, pain or sorrow, the freeing or discharge from some&nbsp;obligation or debt, the action of letting go or releasing something&nbsp;fixed or set in position. In law, the term is applied to the&nbsp;discharge of some obligation, by which it is extinguished (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Debt),</span><span class="font2"> and to the conveyance of an estate or interest in real or&nbsp;personal property to one who has already some estate or interest&nbsp;therein. For the special form of conveyancing known as “ lease&nbsp;and release,” see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Conveyancing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RELICS (Lat, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">reliquiae,</span><span class="font2"> the equivalent of the English “ remains ” in the sense of a dead body), the name given in the&nbsp;Catholic Church to,(i) the bodies of the saints, or portions of&nbsp;them,(2) such objects as the saints made use of during their&nbsp;lives, or as were used at their martyrdom. These objects are&nbsp;held by the Church in religious veneration, and by their means&nbsp;it hopes to obtain divine grace and miraculous benefits </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cone.&nbsp;Trid.</span><span class="font2"> sess. 24).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">These ideas had taken shape, in alt essentials, during the early days of the Church, underwent further development in the middle&nbsp;ages, and were maintained by the Catholic Church in the face&nbsp;of the opposition of the Reformers, while all the Protestant&nbsp;Churches rejected them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The origins of the veneration of relics lie in the anxiety for the preservation of the bodies of the martyrs. Nothing is more&nbsp;natural than that the pious solicitude felt by all men for the&nbsp;bodies of their loved ones should in the primitive Christian&nbsp;Churches have been turned most strongly towards the bodies&nbsp;of those who had met with death in confessing their faith. The&nbsp;account given by the church at Smyrna of the death of their&nbsp;bishop Polycarp (155) gives us an insight into these feelings.&nbsp;The church collected and buried the remains of the martyr,&nbsp;who had been burnt, in order duly to celebrate the anniversary&nbsp;of the martyrdom at the place of burial. The possession of the&nbsp;relics seemed to assure the continuation of the common life of&nbsp;the church with their bishop, of the living with the dead (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mart.&nbsp;Polyc. e.</span><span class="font2"> 17).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The custom of which we have here for the first time an account had become universal by the 3rd century. In all parts the&nbsp;Christians assembled on the anniversary of the martyrs’ death&nbsp;at their graves, to celebrate the Agapc and the Eucharist at&nbsp;this spot. It was a favourite custom to bury the dead near the&nbsp;graves of the martyrs; and it was the highest wish of many to&nbsp;“ rest with the saints.” It was the body lying Inthetombwhich&nbsp;was venerated (see Euseb. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Hist. eccl.</span><span class="font2"> vii. 11, 24; viii. 6, 7).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But these customs soon underwent a further development. About the end of the 3rd and the beginning of the 4th century</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
