Chicago and Alton and the Wabash, St Louis, and Pacific Railways. It is situated in 39° 48' N. lat. and 89° 33' W. long., on a plateau 4 miles south of the Sangamon river. The State capitol (1868-1886) is constructed of Joliet marble in the form of a Greek cross, with porticos of granite ; it is 385 feet long and 296 wide, and has a central dome surmounted by a lantern with a ball on the pinnacle (360 feet). It contains a general library, a law library, geological and agricultural museums, and a memorial hall of the Civil War, as well as the usual Government offices. Other buildings of note are the United States executive mansion, custom-house and post-office (1866-68), and the house formerly occupied by Lincoln. In Oak Ridge cemetery, adjacent to the city, is the Lincoln monument (1874), beneath which that president was buried. The monument, designed by Larkin G. Mead, consists of a granite obelisk, reaching a height of 98 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> / <hi rend="sub">3</hi> feet from the centre of a spacious basement (119 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> / <hi rend="sub">2</hi> feet long and 72 <hi rend="sup">1</hi> / <hi rend="sub">2</hi> wide), which contains a catacomb and a memorial hall,—the latter a museum of Lincolniana.

The town has a public library, two hospitals, two orphanages, and various other charitable institutions.
