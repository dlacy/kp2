<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">family of Perugia as an altar-piece in the church of S. Fiorenzo, and is a work of the highest beauty in colour,&nbsp;well preserved, and very large in scale. The Virgin&nbsp;with veiled head is seated on a throne, supporting the&nbsp;Infant with one hand and holding a book in the other.&nbsp;Below stands S. Niccolo da Tolentino, for whose altar it&nbsp;was painted · he holds a book and a crozier, and is clad&nbsp;in jewelled mitre and green cope, under which appear the&nbsp;alb and cassock. On the other side is the Baptist, in red&nbsp;mantle and camel’s-hair tunic, holding a crystal cross. The&nbsp;rich jewellery in this picture is painted with Flemish-like minuteness. On the border of the Virgin’s robe is a&nbsp;date, formerly read as MDV by Passavant and others; it&nbsp;really is MDVI or MDVII. If the later date is the true&nbsp;one, the picture was probably begun a year or two before.&nbsp;A favourite method of grouping his Holy Families is that&nbsp;seen in the Madonna del Cardellino and the Bella Giar-diniera, in which the main lines form a pyramid. This&nbsp;arrangement is also used in the Madonna del Giardino and&nbsp;in the larger group, including St Joseph and St Elizabeth,&nbsp;known as the Canigiani Holy Family, now at Munich,&nbsp;one of the least graceful of all Raphael’s compositions.&nbsp;The Entombment of Christ, now in the Palazzo Borghese&nbsp;in Rome, was painted during a visit to Perugia in 1507 for&nbsp;Lady Atalanta Baglioni, in memory of the death of her&nbsp;brave and handsome but treacherous son Grifonetto, who&nbsp;was killed in 1500 by his enemies the Oddi party.@@<sup>1</sup> The&nbsp;many studies and preliminary sketches @@<sup>2</sup> for this important picture which exist in various collections show that&nbsp;it cost Raphael an unusual amount of thought and labour&nbsp;in its composition, and yet it is quite one of his least successful paintings, especially in colour. It is, however,&nbsp;much injured by scraping and repainting, and appears not&nbsp;to be wholly by his hand. The Madonna del Baldacchino,&nbsp;one of the finest compositions of the Florentine period,&nbsp;owing much to Fra Bartolomeo, is also unsatisfactory in&nbsp;execution; being left unfinished by Raphael, it was completed by Ridolfo Ghirlandajo, by whom the ungraceful&nbsp;angels of the upper part and the canopy were wholly executed, and even designed. It was painted for the Dei family&nbsp;as an altar-piece for their chapel in S. Spirito, Florence.&nbsp;The St Catherine of the National Gallery was probably&nbsp;painted in 1507 ; its cartoon, pricked for transference,&nbsp;is in the Louvre. In colouring it much resembles parts of&nbsp;the Borghese Entombment, being quiet and grey in tone.&nbsp;To the Florentine period belong some of his finest portraits,&nbsp;and it is especially in these that Da Vinci’s influence&nbsp;appears. The portraits of Angelo Doni and his wife&nbsp;Maddalena (Pitti) are vivid and carefully executed paintings, and the unknown lady with hard features (now in&nbsp;the Uffizi) is a masterpiece of noble realism and conscientious finish. The Czartoriski portrait, a graceful effeminate-looking youth with long hair and tapering hands,&nbsp;now moved to Cracow, is probably a work of this period;&nbsp;though worthy to rank with Raphael’s finest portraits, its&nbsp;authenticity has been doubted. Very similar in style is&nbsp;the Herrenhausen portrait, once attributed to Giovanni&nbsp;Bellini, but an undoubted work of Raphael, in his second&nbsp;manner; it also represents a young man with long hair,&nbsp;close shaven chin, a wide cloth hat and black dress, painted&nbsp;in half length. The so-called Portrait of Raphael by himself at Hampton Court is a very beautiful work, glowing&nbsp;with light and colour, which may possibly be a genuine&nbsp;picture of about 1506. It represents a pleasant-looking&nbsp;youth with turned-up nose, not bearing the remotest&nbsp;resemblance to Raphael, except the long hair and black&nbsp;cap common to nearly all the portraits of this time.@@<sup>3</sup> A&nbsp;fine but much-restored portrait of Raphael by himself,&nbsp;painted at Florence, exists in the Uffizi</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> it represents him&nbsp;at a very early age, and was probably painted during the&nbsp;early part of his stay in Florence.</span></p><div>

At this time the love of the popes for art&nbsp;had already attracted to Rome a number of the chief artists&nbsp;of Tuscany, Umbria, and North Italy, among whom were&nbsp;Michelangelo, Signorelli, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Lorenzo&nbsp;Lotto, Peruzzi, Sodoma, and many others, and it was&nbsp;among this brilliant assembly that Raphael, almost at&nbsp;once, took a leading position.@@<sup>5</sup> Thanks to Bramante’s&nbsp;friendly intervention, Julius II. (Della Rovere) soon became&nbsp;Raphael’s most zealous patron and friend, as did also the&nbsp;rich bankers Agostino Chigi (the Rothschild of his time)&nbsp;and Bindo Altoviti, whose portrait, at the age of twenty,&nbsp;now at Munich, is one of the most beautiful that Raphael&nbsp;ever produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A series of rooms in the Vatican, over the Appartamenti Borgia, were already decorated with frescos by Bonfigli,&nbsp;Perugino, Piero della Francesca, Andrea del Castagno,&nbsp;Signorelli, and Sodoma; but so rapidly had the taste of&nbsp;the time changed that Julius II. decided to sweep them</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">all away and re-cover the walls with paintings in the more developed but less truly decorative style of Raphael. It&nbsp;was not without regret that Raphael saw the destruction&nbsp;of this noble series of frescos. One vault, that of the</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@2</sup> These show that Raphael at first intended to paint a Deposition&nbsp;from the Cross, and afterwards altered his scheme into the Entombment ; an excess of study and elaboration partly account for the&nbsp;shortcomings of this picture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@3</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To judge of the authorship of a portrait from internal evidence is&nbsp;especially difficult, as in so many cases the strong individuality of the&nbsp;person represented obscures that of the painter.</span></p>
