See <hi rend="smallcaps">Lepus.</hi></p>       <p>The buck rabbits, like our boar cats, will ki∏ the young ones if they can get at       them; and the does in the warrens prevent this, by covering their stocks, or       nests, with gravel or earth, which they cloſe ſo artificially up with the hinder       part of their bodies, that it is hard to find them out. They never suckle their       young ones at any other time than early in the morning and late at night ; and       always, for eight or ten days, clofe up the hole at the mouth of the nest, in       this careful manner when they go out. After this they begin to leave a small       opening, which they increase by degrees ; till at length, when they are about       three weeks old, the mouth of the hole is left wholly open that they may go out       ; for they are at that time grown big enough to take care of themselves, and to       feed on grass.</p>       <p>People who keep rabbits tame for profit, breed them in hutches; but these must be       kept very neat and clean, clse they will be always subject to difeases. Care       must be taken also to keep the bucks and does apart till the ∣atter have just       kindled ; then they are to be turned to the bucks again, and to remain with them       till they shun and run from them.</p>       <p>The general direction for the choosing βf tame rabbits is, to pick the largest       and fairest; but the breeder ihould remember that the skins of the       silver-haired ones sell better than any other. The food of the tame rabbits may       be colewort and cabbage-leaves, carrots, pars-r&lt;eps, apple-rinds, green corn,       and vetches, in the time of the year; alſo vine-leaves, grass, fruits, oats, and       oatmeal, milk-thistles, ſow-thiſtles, and the like : but with these moiſt foods       they must always have a pro-portionable quantity of the dry foods, as hay,       bread, oats, bran, and the like, otherwiſe they will grow pot-bellied, and die.       Bran and grains mixed together have been also found to be very good food. In       winter they will eat hay, oats, and chaff, and these may be given them three       times a-day; but when they eat green things, it must be observed that they are       not to drink at ail, for it would throw them into a dropsy. At all other times a       very little drink ſerves their turn, but that must always be freſli. when any       green herbs or .graſs are cut for their food, care must be taken that there be       no hemlock among it; for though they will eat this greedily among other things       when offered to them, yet it is fudden poiſon to them.</p>       <p>Rabbits are subject to two principal infirmities. Firſt, the rot, which is cauſed       by giving them too large a quantity of greens, or from giving them freſli       gathered with the dew or rain hanging in drops upon them.biſected of is over-moiſture       that always cauſes this diſeaſe. The greens therefore are always to be given       dry; and a sufficient quantity of hay, or other dry food, intermixed with them,       to take up the abundant moisture of their juices. Οη this account the very best       food that can be given them, ſame recoveries ſhorteſt and fweeteſt hay that can be got,       of which one load will ferve 200 couples a year ; and out of this stock of 200,       200 may be eat in the family, 200 fold to the markets, and a sufficient number       kept in case of accidents.</p>       <p>The other general diſeaſe of these creatures is a fort of madneſs : this may be       known by their wallowing and tumbling about with their heels upwards, and       hopping Hl an odd manner into their boxes. This diſtem-per is ſuppofod to be       owing to the rankneſs of their feeding; and the general cure ſame recoveries keeping them       low, and giving them the prickly herb called <hi rend="italic">tare-th'file</hi>       to. eat.</p>       <p>The general, computation of ma!es and females is, that one buck-rabbit will serve       for nine does : ſome al-low 10 to one buck £ but those who go beyond this,       always ſuffer sor it in their breed.</p>       <p>The wild rabbits are either to be taken by small cur-dogs, or by ſpaniels bred up       to the sport ; and the places of hunting those who ſtraggle horn their burrows,       is under cloſe hedges or buſhes, or among corn-fields and fresh paſtures. The       owners use to courſe then» with small greyhounds ; and though they are ſeldctn       killed this way, yet they are driven back to their bur-rows, and are prevented       from being a prey to others. The common method ingeniouſly, increaſe nets called <hi         rend="italic">purfi-nets,</hi> and ferrets. The ferret is sent into the hole       to fetch them out; and the purſe-net being ſpread over the hole, takes them as       they come out. The ferrets mouths must be muffled, and then the rabbit gets no       harm. For the more certain taking of them, it may not be improper to pitch up a       hay-net or two, at a fmall distance from the burrows that are intended to be       hunted: thus very few of the number that are attempted will eſcape.</p>       <p>Some who have not ferrets smoke the rabhits out of their holes with burning       brimſtone and orpiment. This certainly brings them out into the nets : but. then       it is a very troublesome and offenſive method ; and is very detrimental to the       place, as. no rabbit will for a long time, afterwards come near the burrows       which have been fumed with those ſtinking ingredients.</p>       <p>I he teſticle of a rabbit is a very good object for examining the structure of       this part of generation in animals. lhe whole ſubſtance ot the testicle in this       ani-. mal is made up of veffels, which lie in round folds in the manner ot the       ſmaller inteſtines: but then both ends, of each roll meet at their inſertion,       which seems to be made into the <hi rend="italic">ductus nervoſus ;</hi> and       every one of these little rolls is curiouſly embroidered with other veſſels,       which, from their red colour, appear to be arteries and veins. The several       little rolls lie in ranges, diſpoſed with an uniformity which is very agreeable       to the eye. Every one of these rolls is not a single and entire tube, but each       consists of several tubes, beſide the veins and arteries which embroider it.       This is best distinguished by the cutting one of the rolls tranfverſely, and       then examining the cut end with a glass, which will appear to be made up of the       cut and open ends of four, five, or more parallel tubes, which together form the       roll, or ſingle tube, as it appears to the eye, being all wrapped, up in one       common and very thin membrane. These are fo tender that they cannot be       explicated and viewed diſtinct, as De Graaf tells us those of the teſticles of a       rat and of fome other animals may. Tlieſe, however, as well as the others, are       only made up of a congeries, of vessels, and the liquors, which are their       contents, without any intermediate ſubſtance, or any thing of that parenchyma       which many authors have talked of. The teſticles of a bull have the greatest       appearance of a fleshy texture of those of any known animal ; yet even thefσ       afford no particle of parenchyma, or flesh, when examined by glaſſes in any fort       of preparation, whether boil-ed, law, foaked in ſpirits} or in whatever other       ſtate.</p>       <pb xml:id="eb03-15-r01-0773" facs="gri_33125011197759_0781.tif"/>       <p>The t¢ſticles of various anima3s are very variouſly com-poſed, but all in this       general manner of veſſels variouſly rolled and folded together: and even the       human teſticles are of the same fort ; being compoſed solely of rolls of       veſſels, without any intermediate substance, be it called by whatever name, but       only consisting of vessels and their liquors.</p>     </div></body></text></TEI>
