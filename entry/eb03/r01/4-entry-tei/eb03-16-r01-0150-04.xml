                <p><label>REVOLUTION</label>, in politics, ſigniſies a change in the conſtitution of
                    a ſtate ; and is a word of different import from <hi rend="italic">revolt,</hi> with which it is ſometimes confounded, when a people withdraw their
                    obedience ſrom their governors for any particular reaſon, without overturning
                    the government, or waging an offenſive war againſt it, they are in a ſtate of
                    revolt; when they over-turn the government and foιm a new one for themſelves,
                    they effect a <hi rend="italic">revolution.</hi></p>
                <p>That which is termed <hi rend="italic">the revolution</hi> in Britain is the
                    change which, in 1688, took place in conſequence of the forced abdication of
                    king James II. when the Pro-teſtant ſucceflion was eſtabliſhed, and the
                    conſtitution reſtored to its primitive purity. 01 this important tranſaction,
                    which confirmed the rights and liberties of Britons, we have endeavoured to give
                    an impartial account under another article (ſee Britain, n <hi rend="sup">o</hi> 281, &amp;c). Οί the riſe and progreſs of the American revolution,
                    which is ſtill freſh in the memory of our readers, a large detail is given under
                    the article America : But there are two other revolutions yet depending, of
                    which ſome account will be expected in this place.</p>
                <p>The Poli(h revolution, which, in all its circumſtances, was perhaps the leaſt
                    exceptionable of any in the records of hiſtory, we have already traced to the
                    period when the amiable king, over-awed by the arms of Ruſ-ſia, was obliged to
                    undo his patriotic work, and give his fonction to the reſtoration of the old and
                    wretched government (fee Poland). Since that period, Koſ-ciuſko’s army has been
                    completely defeated, himſelf made a priſoner, warfow taken, and the whole
                    king-dom ſubdued by the powers combined againſt it. what will be the conſequence
                    of this ſucceſs may perhaps be conceived, bur the rumours of the day are
                    various. At one time we are told, that Poland is to be no longer an independent
                    ſtate, but to be divided among the three great powers which formerly wreſted
                    from it ſome of its moſt valuable provinces. At another time, we hear of the
                    diſintereſted intention of the Emprefs, to reſtore the king to his original
                    authority ; although ſhe has, in the mean time, driven him from his capital,
                    where ſhe herfelf exerciſes fovereign power. And a third report fays, that
                    Staniſlaus is to retire with a large penlion, and a Ruffian prince to ſtep into
                    his throne. The ſirſt ot theſe rumours we think much more probable than the
                    other two : eſpecially as it ſeems confirmed by the following letter fent from
                    Grod-no, on the 18th of January, by the unfortunate king to the Britiſh
                    ambaſſador.</p>
                <p><hi rend="smallcaps">" My dear Gardiner—Tlιe characters with which you and I
                        have been inveſted ſeem to be now almoſt at an end. I do not expect to fee
                        you again, but it is of importance to me to bid you farewell ; and this I do
                        from the bottom of my heart. You will preſerve a place in my heart till
                        death ; and I hope that at laſt we ſhall meet again, in a place where
                        upright minds, ac-cording to my opinion, will be for ever united.</hi></p>
                <p>“ Every thing belonging to the uſual etiquette has been ſo much deranged and
                    interrupted by my fod fate, that moſt probably neither you nor I will be able to
                    fulfil the diplomatic cuſtoms.</p>
                <p>“ But be aſſured, that I love and honour your king</p>

                    no more, my picture will ſpeak to you for me ! (Signed) Stanislaus Augustus,
                    King.”</p>
                <p>This ſhows, at leaſt, the fate of the king ; and leaving that of the kingdom to
                    be afcertained by time, we proceed to fulfil a promiſe which we made reſpe'ting
                    another revolution, to which all the nations of Europe are ſtill looking with
                    anxiety and alarm.</p>
                <p>when treating of France under a former article, we ſtated a few of the more
                    ſtriking hiſtorical facts which led to the commencement of the revolution ; and
                    we now come to trace the feries of tranſactions which have marked its terrible
                    career. In doing this, we ſhall comprefs our ideas as much as poſſible ; and out
                    of the endleſs variety of materials of which the public are in poffeffion, we
                    ſhall endeavour to extract a ſhort and, if poſſible, a tolerably clear detail.
                    For this purpoſe, however, it will be neceſſary that we begin, by ſtating the
                    internal ſituation of France at the period immediately preceding the revolution,
                    along with the more obvious political circumſtances which contributed to the
                    production of that event. The moral hiſtory of man is always more important than
                    the mere recital of any phyfical occurrences that may take place in his lot. It
                    is not the fall of a mighty monarch and the diſperſion of his family ; it is not
                    the convulſion of empires, and the oceans of human blood which have been ſhed,
                    that render the French revolution peculiarly intereſting. Such events, however
                    deplorable, are far from being without example in the hiſtory of mankind. In the
                    populous regions of the eaſt, where ſuperſtition and ſlavery have always
                    prevailed, they are regarded as form-jng a part of the ordinary courſe of human
                    affairs ; be-caufe an intrepid and ſkilful uſurper finds it eaſy to intimidate
                    or enſnare millions of weak and credulous men. In Europe the cafe is very
                    different ; no adventurer can advance far without encountering thoufands as
                    artful and as daring as himſelf. Events are not the refult either of blind
                    hazard or of individual ſkill ; confpira-cies or plots produce little effect.
                    Like other arts, the art of government has been brought to much perfection ; and
                    an eſtabliſhed conſtitution can only be ſhaken by the ſtrong convulſion produced
                    by national paſſions and efforts. The wonderful fpectacle which we are now to
                    contemplate, is that of a mild and poliſhed people be-coming in an inſtant
                    fa∙nguinary and fierce ; a well eſta-bliſhed government, celebrated for its
                    dexterity and ſkill, overturned almqſt without a ſtruggle ; a whole nation
                    apparently uniting to deſtroy every inſtitution which antiquity had
                    hallo&gt;vcd or education taught them to reſpect ; a ſuperſtitious people
                    treating the religion of their fathers with contempt ; a long enſlaved people,
                    whoſe very chains had become dear to them, occupied in their public counſels in
                    the diſcuffion of refined, and even viſionary fchemes of freedom : in ſhort,
                    25,000,000 of perſons ſuddenly treading under foot every ſentiment and every
                    prejudice that they themſelves had once regarded as ſacred and venerable.</p>
                <p>Like the other nations of Europe, France was anciently governed by a barbarous
                    ariſtocracy, whoſe different members were feebly united by the authority of a
                    ſucceſſion of kings deſtitute of power or influence. The nobles, within their
                    own territories, enjoyed privileges entirely royal : they made peace and war ;
                    they coined money; they were judges i∏ the laſt reſort; their vaſſals were their
                    ſlaves, whom they bought and fold along with the lands ; the inhabitants of
                    cities, although freemen, were depreſſed and poor, depending for protection upon
                    ſome tyrannical baron in their neighbourhood. At length, however, by the
                    progreſs of the arts, the cities role into conſiderable importance, and their
                    inhabitants, along with ſuch freemen of low rank as reſided in the conntry, were
                    conſidered as enti-tled to a repreſentation in the ſtates-general of the
                    kingdom, under the appellation of <hi rend="italic">tiers etat,</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic"> third efiaιe ;</hi> the clergy and the nobles forming the
                    two firſt eſtates. But the fovereign, having ſpeedily become deſpotic, the
                    meetings of the ſtates general were laid aſide. Thia, abiolute authority, on the
                    part of the crown, was not acquired, as it was in England by the houfe of Tudor,
                    by abolifhing the pernicious privileges of the nobles and elevating the commons
                    ; but by ſkilful encroachments, by daring exertions of prerogative, and the uſe
                    of a powerful military force. In France, therefore, the mo-narch was abſolute,
                    yet the nobles retained all their feudal privileges, and. the eccleſiaſtical
                    hierarchy did the ſame. The following was, in a few words, the ſtate of that
                    country during thefe two laſt centuries.</p>
                <p>Ί he kingdom of France, previous to the. revolution, was never reduced to one
                    homogenous mafs. It con-ſiſted of a variety of feparate provinces acquired by
                    different means ; ſome by marriage, ſome by legacy", and others by conqueſt.
                    Each province retained its ancient laws and privileges, whether political or
                    civil, as expreſſed in their capitularies or conditions by which they were
                    originally acquired. In one part oſ his do-minions the French monarch was a
                    count, in another he was a duke, and in others he was a king ; the only bond
                    which united his vaſt empire being the ſtrong military force by which it was
                    overawed. Each province had its barriers ; and the intercourfe betwixt one
                    province and another was often more reſtrained by local ufages than the
                    intercourfe of either with a foreign country. Some ot the provinces, ſuch as
                    Bretagne and Dauphiné, even retained the right of aſſembling periodically their
                    provincial ſtates; but theſe formed no barrier againſt the power of the court.</p>
                <p>The clergy formed the ſirſt eſtate of the kingdom in point of precedence. They
                    amounted to 130,000, The higher orders of them enjoyed immenſe revenues ; but
                    the rιzrct or great body of acting clergy ſeldom poffeffed more than about L. 28
                    Sterling a-year, and them <hi rend="italic">vicaires</hi> about half that ſum.
                    A few of their dignified clergy were men of great piety, who reſided coa-ſtantly
                    in their diocefes, and attended to the duties of their office ; but by far the
                    greater number of them paſſed their lives at Paris and Verfailles, immerfed in
                    all the intrigues and diſſipation of a gav and corrupted court and capital. They
                    were almoſt excluſively ſe-lected from among the younger branches of the
                    families of the moſt powerful nobility, and accounted it a kind of diſhonour to
                    the order of biſhops for any perſon of low rank to be admitted into it. The
                    lower clergy, on the contrary, were perſons of mean birth, and had little chance
                    of preferment. At the ſame time, we find ſeveral refpectable exceptions to this
                    laſt rule. The clergy, as a body, independent of the tithes, poſſeſſed a revenue
                    ariiing from their property in land, amounting ∙</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0152" facs="gri_33125011196389_0158.tif"/>
                <p>to four or five millions Sterling annually ; at the ſame time they were exempt
                    from taxation. The crown had of late years attempted to break through this
                    privilege. To avoid the danger, the clergy prefented to the court a free gift of
                    a ſum of money ſomewhat ſhort ol a mil-lion Sterling every five years.</p>
                <p>The nobility was nominally the ſecond order of the ſtatc, but it was in reality
                    the firſt. The nobles amounted to no lefs than 200,oco in number. The title and
                    rank defcended to all the children of the family, but the property to the eldeſt
                    alone : hence vaſt multitudes of them were depcndent upon the bounty of the
                    court. They regarded the ufeful and commercial arts as diſho-nourable, and even
                    the liberal profeſſions of the law and phyfic as in a great meaſure beneath
                    their dignity, diſ-daining to intermarry with the families of their profef-ſors.
                    °The feudal ſyſtem in its purity was extremely favourable to the production of
                    refpectable qualities in the minds of thoſe who belonged to the order of the
                    nobles ; but the introduction of commerce has rendered its decline equally
                    unfavourable to that claſs of men. Inſtead of the ancient patriarchal attachment
                    between the feudal chieftain and his vaffals, the nobility had be-come greedy
                    landlords in the provinces, that they mιg∩t appear in ſplendor at court and in
                    the capital. There, loſt in intrigue, ſenſuality, and vanity, their characters
                    became frivolous and contemptible. Such of the French nobleſſe, however, as
                    remained in the provinces, regard-ed with indignation this degradation oſ their
                    order, and ſtill retained a proud ſenſe of honour and of courage, •which has
                    always rendered them reſpectable. The order of the nobles was exempted from the
                    pay ment of taxes, although the property of fome of them was immenſe. The
                    eſtates of the prince of Conde, for example, were worth L. 200,000 a year, and
                    thoſe of the duke of orleans nearly twice as much. The crown had indeed impoſed
                    ſome trifling taxes upon the nobleſſe, which, however, they in a great meaſure
                    contrived to elude.</p>
                <p>Next to the nobles, and as a privileged order poſſeſ-fing a ſecondary kind of
                    nobility of their own, we may mention the parliaments. Theſe were large bodies
                    of men, in different provinces, appointed as courts of law for the
                    adminiſtration of juſtice. In conſequence of the corruption of the officers of
                    ſtate, the members purcha-ſed their places, which they held for life ; but the
                    ſhn was ufually preferred when he offered to purchaſe his father’s place. In
                    conſequence of this laſt circumſtance, the practifing lawyers had little chance
                    of ever beco-ming judges. Courts thus conſtituted conſiſted of a motley mixture
                    of old and young, learned and ignorant, men. Juſtice was ill adminiſtered. 'Γhe
                    judges allowed their votes in depending cauſes to be openly ſolici-ted by the
                    parties or their friends. No wife man ever entered into a litigation againſt a
                    member of one of theſe parliaments 5 no lawyer would undertake to plead ■his
                    cauſe.; it never came to a ſucceſsful iffue, and uſu-ally never came to any
                    iſſue at all. After the ſtates-general had fallen into difiιfe, the parliaments
                    acquired a certain degree of political confequence, and formed the only check
                    upon the abſolute power of the crown. The laws, or royal edicts, before being
                    put in force, were always ſent to be regiſtered in the books oi the parliaments.
                    Taking advantage of this, in favourable times and circumſtances, they often
                    delayed or refuſed io regiſter .the royal edicts, and preſented remonſtrances</p>
                <p>againſt them. This was done under a kind of legal fiction : for they pretended
                    that the obnoxious edict being injurious to the public happinefs, could not be
                    the will of the king, but muſt either be a forgery or an impoſition by the
                    miniſters. Theſe objections were got the better of, either by a pofitive order
                    from the king, or by his coming in perfon and ordering the edict to be
                    regiſtered. The parliaments, however, often carried their oppoſition very far,
                    even to the ruin of them-felves and their families as individuals. This rendered
                    them extremely popular with the nation, and enabled them to embarrafs a weak
                    adminiſtration. After all, however, the oppoſiticn of the parliaments was fo
                    feeble, that it was never thought worth while to aboliſh them entirely till
                    towards the end of the reign of Louis XV. but they were reſtored as a popular
                    meafure at the beginning of the reign of Louis XVI.</p>
                <p>The <hi rend="italic">tiers etat,</hi> or commons, formed the loweſt order of
                    the ſtate in France, and they were depreſſed and mi-ferable in the extreme. To
                    form a conception of their ſituation, it is neceſſary to obſerve that they bore
                    the whole pecuniary burdens of the ſtate : They alone were liable to taxation.
                    An expenſive and ambitious court ; an army of 200,000 men in time of peace, and
                    of twice that number in war ; a conſiderable marine eſtabliſhment, public roads
                    and works, were all ſupported excluſively by the loweſt of the people. To add to
                    the evil, the revenues were ill collected. They were let out to farmers-general
                    at a certain ſum, over and above which they not only acquired immenſe fortunes
                    to them-ſelves, but were enabled to advance enormous preſents to thoſe
                    favourites or miſtreſſes of the king or the mi-niſter, by means of whom they
                    procured their places. To raiſe all this money from the people, they were guilty
                    of the cruelleſt oppreſſion, having it in their power to obtain whatever revenue
                    laws they pleaſed, and executing them in the fevereſt manner. For this laſt
                    purpoſe they kept in pay an army of clerks, ſubalterns, ſcouts, and ſpies,
                    amounting to 80,000 men. Theſe men were indeed deteſted by the king, whom they
                    de* ceived and kept in poverty ; by the people, whom they oppreſſed ; and by the
                    ancient nobility, as purſe-proud upſtarts. But the court of France could never
                    contrive</p>
                <p>to manage without them. The peaſants could be call-ed out by the intendants of
                    the provinces in what they called <hi rend="italic">corvées</hi> to work upon
                    the high roads for a certain number of days in the year, which was a ſource of
                    ſe-vere oppreffion, as the intendant had the choice of the time and place of
                    their employment, and was not bound to accept of any commutation in money. They
                    were moreover ſubject to the nobles in a thouſand ways. The nobles retained all
                    their ancient manerial or patri-monial juriſdictions. The common people being
                    an-ciently ſlaves, had obtained their freedom upon different conditions. In many
                    places they and their poſterity remained bound to pay a perpetual tribute to
                    their feudal lords. Such tributes formed a conſiderable part of the revenue of
                    many of the provincial nobles. No man could be an officer of the army, by a late
                    regulation, who did not produce proofs of nobility for four genera-tions. The
                    parliaments, although originally of the <hi rend="italic">tiers etat,</hi> attempted alſo to introduce a rule that none but the nobleſſe ſhould be admitted
                    into their order. In ſuch a ſituation, it will not be accounted ſurpriſing that
                    the common people of Fiance were extremely ſuperſti-</p>

                <p>tit&gt;U3 and ignorant. They were, however, paffionately devoted to their
                    monarch, and whatever concerned him. In 1754, when Louis XV. was taken ill at
                    Metz, the whole nation was truly in a kind of deſpair. The cou-rier and his
                    horfe that brought the news of his recovery to Paris were both almoſt ſuffocated
                    by the embraces of the people.</p>
                <p>w^e have faid that the French monarch was deſpo-tic. His power was ſupported by
                    his army and by a watchful police, having in pay an infinite hoſt of ſpies and
                    other ſervants. In France no man was ſafe. The ſecrets of private families were
                    ſearched into. Nothing was unknown to the jealous inquiſition of the police. Men
                    were ſeized by <hi rend="italic">lettres de cachet</hi> when they leaſt
                    ex-pected it, and their families had no means of diſcovering their fate. The
                    ſentence of a court of law againſt a nobleman was uſually reverfed by the
                    miniſter. No book was publiſhed without the licence of a cenſor-ge-neral
                    appointed by the court, and the miniſter was ac-countable to none but the king.
                    No account was given of the expenditure of the public money. Enormous
                    gratifications and penfions were given as the reward of the moſt infamous
                    ſervices. The ſupreme power of the ſtate was uſually lodged with a favourite
                    miſtreſs, and ſhe was ſometimes a woman taken from public proſtitution. This was
                    not indeed the cafe under Louis XVI. but it was nevertheless one of the
                    mis-fortunes of his life that he was far from being abſolute in his own family.
                    Still, however, with all its faults, the French court was the moſt ſplendid and
                    poliſhed in Europe. It was more' the reſort of men of talents and literature of
                    every kind, and there they met with more ample protection, than anywhere elſe.
                    The court was often jealous of their productions, but they met with the moſt
                    diſtinguiſhed attention from men of fortune and rank ; inſomuch that for a
                    century ſſaſt the French have given the law to Europe in all queſtions of taſte,
                    of literature, and of every polite accompliſh-ment. The gay elegance that
                    prevailed at court dif-fuſed itſelf through the nation ; and amidſt much
                    internal miſery, gave it to a foreigner the appearance of hap-pineſs, or at
                    leaſt of levity and vanity.</p>
                <p>Such as it was, this government had ſtood for ages, and might have continued,
                    had not a concurrence of cauſes contributed to its overthrow. The inferior
                    orders of clergy, excluded from all chance of preferment, regarded their
                    ſuperiors with jealouſy and envy, and were ready to join the laity of their own
                    rank in any popular commotion. The inferior provincial nobleſſe beheld with
                    contempt and indignation the vices and the power of the courtiers, and the
                    higher nobility wiſhed to diminiſh the power of the crown. The practiſing
                    lawyers, almoſt entirely excluded from the chance of becoming judges, wiſhed
                    eagerly for a change of affairs, not doubting that their talents and
                    profeſſional ſkill would render them neceſſary amidſt any alterations that could
                    occur- Accordingly, they were the firſt inſtruments in producing the.
                    revolution, and have been its moſt active ſupporters. The monied intereſt wiſhed
                    ca-gerly for the downfal of the ancient nobility. As for the great mafs of the
                    common people, they were too ignorant, too firperſtitiouſly attached to old
                    eſtabliſh-wιents, and too much depreſſed, to have any conception of the nature
                    of political liberty, or any hope of obtaining it. we have already ſtated the
                    leading circum-ſtances which led to the French revolution (ſee Franck, n <hi
                        rend="sup"> o</hi> 184, &amp;c. ) ; but there were other circumſtances
                    which contributed in an equal degree both to its commence-ment and its progreſs.</p>
                <p>For 40 years the principles of liberty had been diſſe-minated with eagerneſs in
                    France by ſome men of great talents, as Rouſſeau, Helvetius, and Raynal, to whom
                    the celebrated Montefquieu had led the way. Beſides thefe, there was in France a
                    vaſt multitude of what were called <hi rend="italic">men oſ letters,</hi> or
                    perſons who gave this account of the manner in which they fpent their time. All
                    theſe were deeply engaged on the fide of ſome kind of political reform. The men
                    of letters in Paris alone are ſaid to have amounted to 20,000. Cue of the laſt
                    acts of the admiiiiſtration of the archbiſhop of Thouloufe was, on the 5th July
                    1788, to publiſh a refolution of the king in council, inviting all his ſubjects
                    to give him their advice with regard to the ſtate of affairs. This was
                    confidered as a conceſſion of an unlimited liberty of the preſs ; and it is
                    ſcarcely poſſible to form an idea of the infinite variety of political
                    publications which from that period diffuſed among the people a diſſatisfaction
                    with the order of things in which they had hitherto lived.</p>
                <p>The eſtabliſhed religion of France had for fome time paſt been gradually
                    undermined. It had been ſolemnly aſſaulted by philoſophers in various elaborate
                    performances ; and men of wit, among ∖vlιom voltaire took the lead, had attacked
                    it with the dangerous weapon of ridicule. The Roman Catholic religion is much
                    expofed in this reſpect, in conſequence of the multitude of falfe miracles and
                    legendary tales with which its hiſtory abounds, without diſcriminating betwixt
                    the refpect-able principles on which it reſts, and the fuperſtitious follies by
                    which they had been defaced, the French nation learned to laugh at the whole,
                    and rejected inſtead of reforming the religion of their fathers. Thus the firſt
                    order in the ſtate had already begun to be regarded as uſeleſs, and the minds of
                    men were prepared for important changes.</p>
                <p>The immenſe population of the city of Paris, amounting to upwards of 800,000
                    fouls, rendered it an important engine in the hands of the conductors of the
                    revolution. An overgrown capital has always proved dangerous to a government
                    that is or attempts to be deſpotic, as appears ſrom the hiſtory of ancient
                    Babylon and Rome, as well as of modern Conſtantinople, of London under Charles
                    I. and Paris under ſeveral of its kings.</p>
                <p>we cannot here avoid mentioning a phyfical event, which affiſted not a little in
                    producing many of the convulſions attending the revolution, a general ſcarcity
                    of grain, which occurred about that period. Οη Sun-day the 13thof July 1788,
                    about nine in the morning, without any eclipſe, a dreadful darknefe ’ſuddenly
                    over-fprcad ſeveral parts of France. It was the prelude of ſuch a tempeſt as is
                    unexampled in the temperate climates of Europe, wind, rain, hail, and thunder,
                    feemed to contend in impetuoſity ; but the hail was the great inſtrument of
                    ruin. Inſtead of the rich proſpects of an early autumn, the face of nature in
                    the ſpace of an hour preſented the dreary afpect of ιιniverfal winter. The foil
                    was converted into a morals, the .ſtanding corn beaten into the quagmire, the
                    vines broken to pieces, the fruit trees demoli.ſhed, and unmelted hail ly-iπg in
                    heaps like rocks of fold ice. Even the robcſt</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0154" facs="gri_33125011196389_0160.tif"/>
                <p>foreſt trees were unable to vvithſtand the fury of the tempeſt. The hail was
                    compofed of enormous, iolid, and angular pieces office, ſome of them weighing
                    from eight to ten ounces. The conntry people, beaten down in the fields on their
                    way to church, amidſt this concuf-ſion of the elements, concluded that the laſt
                    day was arrived ; and ſcarcely attempting to extricate themfelves, lay
                    defpairing and half ſuffocated amidſt the water and the mud, expecting the
                    immediate diffolution of all things. The ſtorm was irregular in its
                    devaſtations. while ſeveral rich diſtricts were laid entirely waſte, ſome
                    intermediate portions of country were comparatively little injured. Οηε of 6o
                    ſquare leagues had not a fingle ear of corn or a fruit of any kind left, of the
                    66 pariſhes in the diſtrict of Pontoiſe, 43 were entirely defolated, and of the
                    remaining 23 ſome loſt two-thirds and others half their harveſt. The iſle of
                    France, be-ing the diſtrict in which Paris is ſituated, and the Ογ-leannois,
                    appear to have ſuffered chiefly. The damage there, upon a moderate eſtimate,
                    amounted to 80,000,000 of livres, or between three and four millions Sterling.
                    Such a calamity muſt at any period have been ſeverely felt ; but occurring on
                    the eve of a great political revolution, and amidſt a general ſcarcity
                    throughout Europe, it was peculiarly unfortunate, and gave more embarraſſment to
                    the government than per-haps any other event whatever. Numbers of families found
                    it neceſſary to contract their mode of living for a time, and to diſmifs their
                    ſervants, who were thus left deſtitute of bread. Added to the public difcontent
                    and political diſſenſions, it produced ſuch an effect upon the people in
                    general, that the nation ſeemed to have changed its character ; and inſtead of
                    that levity by which it had ever been diſtinguiſhed, a fettled gloom now feemed
                    fixed on every countenance.</p>
                <p>The ſpring of the year 1789 was a period of much political anxiety in France.
                    The ſuperior orders wiſhed to reduce the power of the crown, but were jealous oſ
                    their own privileges, and determined to retain them; while the popular
                    philoſophers and others were endeavouring to render them odious, and to rouſe
                    the people to a love of freedom. Still, however, the great body of the common
                    people remained careleſs fpectators of the ſtruggle and unconſcious of the
                    approaching commotion. Such was their indifference, that few of them took the
                    trouble even to attend and vote at the elections of the deputies to the
                    ſtates-general. In many places, where a thouſand voters were expected, not fifty
                    came forward ; but ſuch of them as did appear ſhowed that a feed was fown which
                    might one day rife into important fruits. In the inſtructions which they gave to
                    their deputies, the Britiſh conſtitution was in general the model of what they
                    wiſhed their government to be. They demanded equal taxation, the abolition of <hi rend="italic">lettres de cachet</hi> or arbitrary impriſonment, the
                    refponſibility of miniſters, and the extinction of the feudal privileges of the
                    nobles ; but they wiſhed that the whole three orders of the ſtate ſhould fit and
                    vote in one houſe, well knowing that their nobility were not prepared to act the
                    moderate part of a Britiſh houſe of lords. The nobles, on the contrary, although
                    willing to renounce ſome of their pecuniary privileges, and to ſacrifice the
                    power of the crown, were moſt deciſively reſolved neither to ſurrender their
                    feudal prerogatives nor the right of fitting in three feparate affemblies; by
                    means of which each of the orders could eaſily reſiſt the encroachments of the
                    other two. Mr Neckar has been improperly cen-fured for not deciding this laſt
                    important queſtion pre-vious to the meeting of the ſtates-gencral : but it muſt
                    be obſerved, that the very purpoſe of calling that aſſembly vzas to overturn the
                    unjuſt privileges of the higher orders through its medium, and without any
                    di-rect interpoſition on the part of the miniſters. Had the king poſitively
                    decided in favour of three chambers, the nobles and the clergy would have
                    retained all thoſe ancient abuſes eſtabliſhed in their own favour, of which it
                    was his wiſh to deprive them, and the crown and its prerogatives would have been
                    the only objects of ſacri-fice. It w <hi rend="sup">τ</hi> as therefore
                    thought ſafer to leave the <hi rend="italic">tiers etat</hi> to fight its own
                    battle : nor was it yet imagined that the commons of France, depreſſed and poor,
                    and diſperſed by ſituation over a multitude of provinces, could ever unite in
                    enterpriſes dangerous to tire ſove-reign.</p>
                <p>The ſtates had been ſummoned to meet at verfailles on the 27th of April, and
                    moſt of the deputies arrived at that time ; but the elections for the city of
                    Paris not. being concluded, the king deferred the commencement of their ſeffions
                    till the 4th of May. During this period, the members, left in idleneſs, began to
                    find out and form acquaintance with each other. Among others, a few members from
                    Brittany (Bretagne) form-ed themſelves into a club, into which they gradually
                    ad-mitted many other deputies that were found to be zea-lous for the popular
                    cauſe, and alſo many perſons who were not deputies. This ſociety, thus
                    originally eſta-bliſhed at verfailles, was called the <hi rend="italic">Comité
                        Breton;</hi> and was one day deſtined, under the appellation of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> (fa-cobin Club,</hi> to give laws to France, and to diſſuſe
                    terror and alarm throughout Europe. Οη the other fide, the ariſtocratic party
                    eſtabliſhed conferences at the houſe of Madame Polignac, for the purpoſe, it is
                    ſaid, of uniting the nobles and the clergy.</p>
                <p>An event occurred at this time which all parties aſcri-bed to ſome malicious
                    motive. In the populous ſuburb of St Antoine, a M. Reveillon carried on a great
                    paper manufactory. A falſe report was ſpread that he intended to lower the wages
                    of his workmen, and that he had declared bread was too good for them, and that
                    they might ſubſiſt very well on potato-flour. A corn-motion was raifed, he was
                    burnt in effigy, and his houſe was thereafter burnt and pillaged by the mob, who
                    were not diſperſed till the military had been called in, and much carnage
                    enſued. The popular party aſſerted that the commotion had been artfully excited
                    by the party of the queen and the Count D’Artois, to afford a pretence for
                    bringing great bodies of the military to the neighbourhood to overawe the
                    ſtates-general, or induce the king more decifively to reſolve on affembling that
                    body at verfailles, in preference to Paris, where they and the popular miniſter
                    M. Neckar wiſhed it to be held.</p>
                <p>Ο11 the 4th of May the ſtates-general aſſembled at verfailles. They commenced
                    bufineſs by going in a folemn proceſſion, preceded by the clergy, and foliow-ed
                    by the king, according to ancient cnſtom, to church, to perform an act of
                    devotion. The nobles were ar-rayed in a ſplendid robe, and they and the higher
                    cler-gy glittered in gold and jewels. The commons ap-peared in black, the drefs
                    belonging to the law. The</p>

                <p>aſſembly was thereafter opened by a ſhort ſpeech ſrom the throne, in which the
                    king congratulated hitnſelf up-on thus meeting his people aſſembled ; alluded to
                    the national debt, and the taxes, which were ſeverely felt becaufe unequally
                    levied ; he took notice of the general difcontent and ſpirit of innovation which
                    prevailed, but declared his confidence in the wifdom of the aſſembly for
                    remedying every evil. “ May an happy union (added he) reign in this aſſembly;
                    and may this epocha become ever memorable for the happineſs and proſperi-tv of
                    the country. It is the wiſh of my heart ; it is the moſt ardent deſire of my
                    prayers ; it is, in ſhort, the price which I expect from the ſincerity of my
                    intentions and my love for my people.”</p>
                <p>M. Barretin, the keeper of the feals, next addreſſcd the aſſembly <hi rend="sup"
                        > ,</hi> in a congratulatory and unintereſting ſpeech. He was followed by
                    the popular miniſter M. Neckar, who ſpoke for three hours. Though much applauded
                    on account of the clear financial details which his ſpeech contained, he
                    encountered a certain degree of cenſure from all parties, on account of the
                    cautious ambiguity which he obferved with regard to the future proceedings of
                    the ſtates-generah</p>
                <p>Next day the three orders aſſembled ſcparately. The deputies of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> tiers etat</hi> amounted to 600 in number, and thoſe of the
                    nobles and clergy to 300 each. During their firſt fittings much time was ſpent
                    in unimportant debates about trifling points of form ; but the firſt important
                    queſtion, that neceſſarily became the fubject of their diſcuſſion, was the <hi
                        rend="italic"> verification •ſ thctr powers,</hi> or production of the
                    commiſſions of the members, and inveſtigation of their authenticity. The commons <hi rend="italic">(tiers etat)</hi> laid hold of this as a pretext for
                    opening the grand controverſy, whether the ſtates-general ſhould fit in one or
                    in three feparate chambers ? They ſent a deputation inviting the nobles and the
                    clergy to meet along with them in the common hall for the purpoſe of <hi
                        rend="italic"> verifying their powers</hi> in one common aſſembly. In the
                    chamber of the clergy 114 members voted for the performance of this ceremony in
                    the general aſſembly ; and 133 againſt it. But in the more haughty order of the
                    nobles, the refolution for the verification in their own aſſembly was carried by
                    a majority of 188 againſt 47. The commons paid no regard to this. They were
                    conducted by bold and ſkilful leaders, who diſ-cerned the importance of the
                    point in conteſt, and re-folved not to abandon it. Aware of the exigencies of
                    the ſtate, they knew that the crown was nearly verging upon bankruptcy ; and
                    that ſuch were the deficiencies of the revenue that only a ſhort delay was
                    neceſſary to accompliſh the abſolute diſſolution of the government. They
                    ſuſſered five weeks to pals away therefore in total inactivity. During this
                    period propoſals were made on the part of the miniſtry for a pacification
                    between the three orders, and conferences were opened by com-miſſioners from
                    each. But no art could ſeduce the commons from their original purpoſe, or
                    prevail with them to enter upon the bull nefs of the ſtate.</p>
                <p>The nation had expected much from the aſſembling of the ſtates-general, and
                    learnt the news of their inaction with no fmall degree of concern. The <hi
                        rend="italic"> tiers etat</hi> was naturally popular, and the public
                    cenſure could not readily devolve upon that favourite order. Moreover, ſrom the
                    firſt period of their aſſembling the commons made every effort to augment their
                    own natural popularity. They admitted all perſons promiſcuoufly into the
                    galleries, and even into the body of their hail. No reſtraint was attempted to
                    be laid upon the moſt vehement marks oſ popular applauſe or cenſure. Lifts of
                    the voters names were publicly taken and ſent to Paris upon every remarkable
                    occaſion ; and the members ſud-denly found themſelves become, according to their
                    political ſentiments, the objects of general execration or applauſe. The new and
                    bold notions of liberty that were daily advanced by the leaders of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> tiers etat</hi> were received with acclamation by their
                    hearers. The capi-tal became intereſted in the iſſue of every debate ; and the
                    political fervor was eagerly imbibed by the nation with that vivacity which is
                    ſo peculiar to the French. The commons accuſed the nobles of obſtinately
                    impeding the buſineſs of the ſtate, by refuſing to verify their powers in one
                    common aſſembly. The accuſation was ſwallowed by the multitude, who ſaw not, or
                    were unwilling to ſee, that the attack was made by their own favourite order. In
                    the mean time the nobles became rapidly more and more unpopular. Their perfons
                    were inſulted, new publications daily came forth, and were greedily bought up,
                    which reviled their whole order, and repreſented them as an uſeleſs or
                    pernicious body of men, whoſe exiſtence ought not to be tolerated in a free
                    ſtate. whoever adhered to them was branded with the odious appellation of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Briβocrate.</hi> The clergy, from the influence of the
                    pariſh <hi rend="italic">curés</hi> or parfons, feemed ready</p>
                <p>to defert their cauſe. They were even oppoſed by a minority of their own body,
                    which derived luſtre from ha-ving at its head the duke of orleans, the firſt
                    prince of the blood. Still, however, the majority of the nobles remained firm ;
                    well aware, that if they once con-fented to lit in the ſame aſſembly, and to
                    vote promif-cuouſly, with the ambitious and more numerous body of the commons,
                    their wdιole order, and all its ſplendid privileges, muſt ſpeedily be
                    overthrown.</p>
                <p>The leaders of the commons ſaw the change that was taking place in the minds of
                    men ; and they at length regarded the period as arrived when they ought to
                    emerge from their inactivity, and execute the daring project of ſeizing the
                    legiſlative authority in their country. They declared that the reprefentatives
                    of the nobles and the clergy were only the deputies of particular incorporations
                    whom they would allow to fit and vote along with themſelves ; but who had no
                    title in a collective capacity to act as the legiſlators of Franc,e. For
                    conducting buſineſs with more facility, they appointed 20 committees. In
                    conſequence of a propoſal by the Abbé Sieyes, a final meſſage was fent to the
                    privileged orders requiring their attendance as individuals, and intimating that
                    the commons, as the deputies of 96 out of every hundred of their country-men,
                    were about to affume the exclufive power of le-giſlation. None of the nobles
                    obeyed this ſummons ; but three cures, Meſſrs Ceſve, Ballard, and Jalot,
                    preſented their commiſſions, and were received with loud acclamations. They were
                    next day followed by five more, among whom were Meſſrs Gregoire, Dillon, and
                    Bodineau. After ſome debate concerning the appella-tion which they ought to
                    affirme, the commons, with ſuch of the clergy as had joined them, ſolemnly voted
                    themſelves the fovereign legiſlators of their country un-derthe name of the <hi

                <p>with ſhouts from the immenſe concourſe of ſpectators of " Vive le Roi et vive
                    l’affemble nationale,” <hi rend="italic">Long live the king and the national

                    Camus and Piſon de Galand fεcrctaries, and the aſſembly proceeded to bu∙ fineſs.</p>
                <p>Its firſt acts were deciſively expreſſive of its own ſo-vereignty. All taxes
                    impoſed without the conſent of the reprefentatives of the people were declared
                    to be null and void ; but a temporary fonction was given to the preſent taxes,
                    although illegal, till the diſſolution of the aſſembly and no longer. It was
                    added, that " as ſoon as, in concert with his majeſty, the aſſembly ſhould be
                    able to fix the principles of national regeneration, it would take into
                    conſiderat ion the <hi rend="italic">national debt,</hi> placing from the
                    prefent moment the creditors of the ſtate un-der the fofeguard and honour of the
                    French <hi rend="italic">nation.”</hi></p>
                <p>The popular caufe now gained ground fo faſt, that on the 19th of June a majority
                    of the clergy voted for the verification of their powers in common with the
                    national aſſembly, and they reſolved to unite with them on the following day.</p>
                <p>Affairs were now come to a crifis, and the nobleβ perceived that they muſt
                    inſtantly make a decifive ſtand, or yield up their cauſe as finally loft. Such
                    was their alarm, that M. d’Eſpremenil propoſed, at one of the fittings of their
                    order, to addreſs the king, intreating him to diſſolve the ſtates-generah
                    Hi-therto that prince had gone along with M. Neckar in favouring the popular
                    cauſe in oppoſition to the ariſto' cracy. But every art was now uſed to alarm
                    his mind upon the ſubject of the late aſſumptions of power on the part of the
                    commons, and theſe arts were at length ſucceſsful. Repeated counſels were held ;
                    M. Neckar was abſent attending a dying fiſter, and the king was prevailed upon
                    to act agreeably to the advice of the leaders of the nobles. But the firſt
                    meafure which they adopted was fo ill conducted as to afford little proſpect of
                    final ſucceſs to their cauſe. Οη the 20th of June,, when the preſident and
                    members were about to enter as uſual into their own hall, they found it
                    unexpectedly ſurrounded by a detachment of the guards, who refuſed them
                    admiffion, while the heralds at the ſame time pro-claimed a royal ſeſſion.
                    Alarmed by this unforeſeen event, the meaning of which they knew not, but
                    ap-prehending that an immediate diſſolution of the aſſembly was deſigned, they
                    inſtantly retired to a neighbouring tennis-court, where, in the vehemence of
                    their enthu-iiaſm, they took a folemn oath " never to feparate till the
                    conſtitution of their country ſhould be completed.”</p>
                <p>Οη the 22d a new proclamation intimated that the royal ſeſſion, was deferred
                    till the following day. It was now found that the aſſembly had been excluded
                    from their hall merely becaufe the workmen were oc-cupied in preparing it for
                    the intended ſolemnity. This information was ill calculated to excite favourable
                    expectations of the meaſures about to be adopted at a royal ſeffion, uſhered in
                    by ſuch circumſtances of mark-ed diſreſpect for the reprefentatives of the
                    people. The aſſembly, after wandering about in ſearch of a place of meeting, at
                    length entered the church of St Louis, and were immediately joined by the
                    majority of the clergy, with their preſident, the archbiſhop of vienne, at their
                    head. Two nobles of Dauphiné, the marquis de Blacon and. the count d’Agoult,
                    preſcnted. their cou∖-</p>
                <p>miſſions at the ſame time. Encouraged by theſe events, and by the applauſes of
                    fiμroundiιιg multitudes, the aſſembly now expected with firmneſs the meaſures
                    about to be adopted.</p>
                <p>The royal'ſeffion was held in the moſt fplendid form,D but altogether in the
                    ſtyle of the ancient deſpotiſm. Soldiers ſurrounded the hall. The two ſuperior
                    orders were ſeated, while the reprefentatives of the people, left ſtanding a
                    full hour in the rain, were in no humour, when at laſt admitted, to receive with
                    much compla-cency the commands of their fovereign. The king read a diſcourſe, in
                    which he declared null and void the reſolutions of the r7tl1, but at the ſame
                    time preſented the plan of a conſtitution for France. It contained many good and
                    patriotic principles, but preſerved the diſtinction of orders, and the exerciſe
                    of <hi rend="italic">lettres de cachet ;</hi> it foid nothing about any active
                    ſhare in the le-giſlative power to be poſſeſſed by the ſtates-general, and was
                    ſilent both about the reſponſibility of miniſters and the liberty of the prefs.
                    The king concluded by commanding the deputies immediately to retire, and to
                    aſ-ſemble again on the following day. He then withdrew, and was followed by all
                    the nobles and a part of the clergy. The commons remained in gloomy ſilence on
                    their feats. It was interrupted by the grand maſter of the ceremonies, who
                    reminded the preſident of the intentions of the king. Inſtantly the vehement
                    count de Mirabeau, ſtarting from his feat, exclaimed with indignation, " ſ'he
                    commons of France have determined to debate, we have heard the intentions that
                    have been ſuggeſted to the king ; and you, who cannot be his agent with the
                    ſtates-general, you who have here neither feat nor voice, nor a right to ſpeak,
                    are not the perfon to remind us of his ipeech. Go tell your maſter, that we are
                    here by the power , of the people, and that nothing ſhall expel us but the
                    bayonet.” '1 he applauſe of the aſſembly ſeconded the enthuſiaſm oſ the orator,
                    and the maſter of the ceremonies withdrew in filence.</p>
                <p>M. Camus then roſe ; and in a violent ſpeech indignantly ſtigmatiſed the royal
                    ſeffion by the obnoxious appellation of a <hi rend="italic">bed oſjufiice ;</hi> he concluded by moving that the aſſembly ſhould declare their unqualified
                    adhe-rence to their former decrees. This motion was fol» lowed by another,
                    pronouncing the perſons of the de-puties inviolable. Both were iuppoιted by
                    Meſſrs Pc’ tion, Barnave, Glaizen, the Abbés Gregoire, Sieyes, and many others,
                    and were unanimouſly decreed. The aſſembly therefore continued their fittings in
                    the uſual form. Οη the following day the majority of the clergy attended as
                    mcmbers ; and on the 25th the duke of ûrleans, along with 49 of the deputies
                    belonging to the order of nobles, joined them alſo. The remaining nobles, as
                    well as the fmall minority of the clergy, now found themſelves aukwardly
                    ſituated. whether on this account, or becauſe their leaders had by.this time
                    formed a plan for carrying their point not by peaceable means but by the aid of
                    a military force, the king, on the 27th, invited by a preffing letter both
                    orders to join the commons. This requeſt was immediately complied with, although
                    many of the nobility difoppro-ved of the raeaſure.</p>
                <p>The ſituation of France was now become truly alarming, when the king retired

                <p>citizens, from whom loud clamours and every mark of diſapprobation broke forth.
                    All verfailles was fpeedily in an uproar. M. Neckar had repeatedly folicited his
                    diſmiſſion, and the report of this had increaſed the po-pular clamour. The court
                    was in conſternation. The king probably diſcovered, with no great fatisfaction,
                    that his miniſter was more popular than himſelf. At fix o’clock in the evening
                    the queen fent for M. Nec-kar. when he returned from the palace, he affined the
                    crowd that waited for him that he would not abandon them ; upon which they
                    retired ſatisſied. At the ſame time the news of the royal ſeſſion had thrown the
                    city of Paris into violent agitation. The peace of that ca-pital was at this
                    time endangered by a variety of cauſes. A dreadful famine raged through the
                    land, which in a great city is uſually moſt ſeverely felt. This prepared the
                    minds of men for receiving unfavourable impreſ-fions of their political ſtate.
                    Every effort was more-over made to diſorganize the government, and produce a
                    diſlike to the ancient order of things. The preſs poured forth innumerable
                    publications, filled with new and feducing, though generally impracticable,
                    theories of liberty. Theſe were diſtributed^r«/z'j· among the bulk of the people
                    of Paris, and diſperſed in the fame manner through the provinces. Philip duke of
                    Ογ-leans (preſumptive heir to the crown failing the children and brothers of the
                    king) is with good reaſon believed to have ſupplied this expence out of his more
                    than royal revenues. In the gardens of the Palais Royale at Paris, which
                    belonged to him, an immenſe multitude was daily aſſembled, liſtening from
                    morning to night to orators who deſcanted upon the moſt violent ſubjects of
                    popular politics. Many of theſe orators were fuſpected to be in his pay. It was
                    even believed that his money found its way into the pockets of ſome of the moſt
                    diſtinguiſhed leaders in the national aſſem-bly.</p>
                <p>But the government was, if poſſible, ſtill more dan-gerouſly aſſaulted by the
                    methods now generally uſed to ſeduce the military. Every officer of the French
                    army belonged to the order of the nobles ; and from that quarter, therefore, it
                    might have been imagined that there was little danger. But this very
                    circumſtance became the means of diforganizing that great engine of deſpotiſm.
                    As the ſoldiers could not avoid imbibing ſome of the new opinions, their own
                    officers became the firſt objects of their jealouſy ; eſpecially in conſequence
                    of that impolitic edict of Louis XVI. which required every officer to produce
                    proofs of four degrees of nobi-Iity ; and thus inſulted, by avowedly excluding
                    the pri-vate men from promotion. Perhaps with a view to what might happen, the
                    inſtructions to the deputies of the <hi rend="italic">tiers eta(</hi> had
                    recommended an increaſe of the p y of the ſoldiers. And now at Paris every art
                    was uſed to gain them to the popular cauſe. They were con-ducted to the Palais
                    Royal, and were there careſſed and flattered by the populace, while they
                    liſtened to the po-pular harangues. Theſe arts were ſucceſsful. Οη the 23d of
                    June they firſt refuſed to fire on the mob in a riot. Some of them were on the
                    30th reported to be</p>
                <p>in confinement for this offence ; a crowd inſtantly col-lected, and reſcued
                    them, the dragoons that were brought to ſupprefs the tumult grounding their arms
                    : a deputation of the citizens folicited of the aſſembly the pardon of the
                    priſoners. The aſſembly applied to the king, who pardoned them accordingly.</p>
                <p>All theſe events, together with the tumultuous ſtate of the capital, which was
                    daily increafing, made it neceſſary for the king to call out the military force
                    to reſtore, if poſſible, the public peace. 'Γhat his intentions were pure, the
                    then ſtate of affairs will permit no man but a democrate to doubt ; but the
                    ariſtocracy, with the Count d’Artois at their head, were bringing forward other
                    meaſures, which ultimately contributed to the ruin of themſelves, the king, and
                    the kingdom. Crowds of ſoldiers were collected from all parts of the kingdom
                    around Paris and verfailles. It was obſerved,</p>
                <p>. that theſe confiſted chiefly of foreign mercenaries. Camps were traced out.
                    Marſhal Broglio, a tried ve-teran, was ſent for and placed at the head of the
                    army. The king was ſuppoſed to have entirely yielded to new counſels, and every
                    thing bore the appearance of a deſperate effort to reſtore the energy of the
                    ancient government. This is the moſt important period of the French revolution ;
                    yet the ſpecific deſigns oſ the leading actors have never been clearly
                    underſtood. It was rumoured at the time, that Paris was to be ſubdued by a liege
                    and bombardment ; that the aſſembly was to be diſſolved, and its leaders put to
                    death. Theſe are in</p>
                <p>credible exaggerations ; but the criſis of French liberty was univerſally
                    regarded as at hand, and alſo the exiſtence of the national aſſembly as an
                    independent body ; or at leaſt upon any other footing than that propoſed by the
                    king on the 23d of June.</p>
                <p>An able and eloquent addreſs to the king againſt the aſſemblage of foreign
                    troops in their neighbourhood was brought forward by Mirabeau, and voted by the
                    aſſembly. The king properly replied, that the ſtate of the capital was the cauſe
                    of aſſembling the troops, and offered to transfer the ſtates-general to Noyons
                    or Soiſ-fons. " we will neither remove (exclaimed Mirabeau) to Noyons· nor to
                    Soiſſons ; we will not place ourſelves between two hoſtile armies, that which is
                    beſieging Paris and that which may fall upon us from Flanders or Alſace ; we
                    have not aſked permiſſion to run away from the troops ; we have defined that the
                    troops-ſhould be ‘ removed from the capital.”</p>
                <p>Ίhirty-five thouland men were now ſtationed in the neighbourhood of Paris and
                    verfailles. The poſts were occupied which commanded the city, and camps were
                    marked out for a greater force. The Count d’Artois and his party regarded their
                    plans as ripe for execution ; and M. Neckar received a letter from the king,
                    requiring him to quit the kingdom in 24 hours. That popular<note anchored="true"
                        place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1">Popular he certainly was ; but he
                        either had not fortitude and talents to execute his own plans, or acted a

                    miniſter took the route of Bruſſels on the following day, when his departure was
                    made public. In his diſmiffion the popular, or as it was now called the <hi
                        rend="italic"> democratic,</hi> party thought they faw the refolution
                    adopted to accompliſh their ruin. The affembly again addrefled the throne ; they
                    requeſted anew the removal</p>
             
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0158" facs="gri_33125011196389_0164.tif"/>
                <p>of the troops, offering to be reſponſible for the public peace, and to proceed
                    in a body to Paris to encoun-ter perſonally every danger that might occur. But
                    they were coolly told, that the king was the beſt judge of the mode of employing
                    the troops, and that the pre-fence of the aſſembly was neceſſary at Verfailles.
                    From a fovereign who doubtleſs recollected the proceedings of the long
                    parliament of England, a different reply could not in reafon be expected. Οη
                    receiving it, however, it was inſtantly decreed, on the motion of the marquis de
                    la Fayette, that the late miniſtry had <hi rend="italic">carried with them</hi> the confidence of the aſſembly ; that the troops <hi rend="italic">ought</hi> to be <hi rend="italic">removed ;</hi> that the miniſtry are and ſhall
                    be reſponſible to the people for their conduct ; that the aſſembly perſiſted in
                    all its former decrees ; and that as it had taken the public debt under the
                    protec-tion of the nation, no power in France was entitled to pronounce the
                    infamous word <hi rend="italic">bankruptcy.</hi></p>
                <p>The city of Paris was thrown into deep conſterna-tion by the news of M. Neckar’s
                    retreat. His bull and that of the Duke dOrleans were dreſſed in mourning, and
                    carried through the ſtreets. The royal Alle-mand, a German regiment, broke in
                    pieces the buſts, and diſperſed the populace. The prince De Lambeſq, grand
                    ecuyer of France, was ordered to advance with his regiment of cavalry, and take
                    poſt at the Tlιuilleries. Being a man of a violent temper, and enraged by the
                    appearances of diſapprobation which were viſible around him, he furiouſly cut
                    down with his ſword a poor old man who was walking peaceably in the gardens. The
                    conſequences of this act of inhumanity were ſuch as might have been expected ; a
                    ſhout of execration instantly aroſe ; the cry <hi rend="italic">to arms</hi> was heard ; the military were aſſaulted on all ſides ; the French guards joined
                    their countrymen, and compelled the Germans, over-powered by numbers, and
                    unſupported by the reſt of the army, to retire.</p>
                <p>All order was now at an end, and as night approached an univerſal terror
                    diſſuſed itſelf through the city. Bands of robbers were collecting ; and from
                    them or from the foreign ſoldiery a general pillage was expected. The night
                    paſſed away in conſternation and tumult. It was found in the morning that the
                    hoſpital of St Lazare was already plundered. The alarm bells were rung ; the
                    citizens aſſembled at the Hotel de ville, and adopted a propoſal that was there
                    made, of enrolling themſelves as a militia for general defence, under the
                    appellation of the <hi rend="italic">national guard.</hi> This day and the
                    ſucceed-ing night were ſpent in tolerable quietneſs, without any attempt on the
                    part of the army. Οη the morning of the memorable 14th of July, it was
                    diſcovered that the troops encamped in the Champs Eliſees had moved off, and an
                    immediate aſſault was expected. The national guard now amounted to 150,000 men ;
                    but they were in general deſtitute of arms. They had aſſumed a green cockade ;
                    but on recollecting that this was the livery of the Count d’Artois, they adopted
                    one of red, blue, and white. M. de la Salle was named commander in chief,
                    officers were choſen, and detachments ſent around in queſt of arms. In the Hotel
                    des Invalides upwards of 30,000 ſtand of arms were found, along with 20 pieces
                    of cannon ; a variety of weapons was alfo procured from the <hi rend="italic">garde meuble de la couronne,</hi> and from the ſhops of armourers, cutlers,
                    &amp;c. »</p>
                <p>The celebrated fortreſs of the Baſtile was an object</p>
                <p>of much jealouſy to the Pariſians. At 11 o'clock in the morning, M. de la
                    Roſiere, at the head of a numerous deputation, waited upon M. de Launay the
                    go-vernor, who promifed, ∙ along with the officers of his garrifon, that they
                    would not ſire upon the city unleſs they ſhould be attacked. But a report was
                    foon ſpread through Paris, that M. de Launay had, in a ſhort time thereafter,
                    admitted into the fortreſs a multitude of perſons, and then treacherouſly
                    maſſacred them. The cauſe of this piece of perfidy has never been explained. The
                    fact itſelf has been denied ; but it was atteſted at the time by the duke of
                    Dorſet, the Britiſh ambaſſa-dor at the court of France. The effect of the report
                    was, that a ſudden refolution was adopted of aſſaulting the Baſtile ; an immenſe
                    and furious multitude ruſhed into its outer, and ſoon forced their way into its
                    inner, courts, where they received and returned a ſevere fire for the fpace of
                    an hour. The French guards, who were now embodied into the national guard,
                    conducted the attack with ſkill and coolneſs : they dragged three waggons loaded
                    with ſtraw to the foot of the walls, and there ſet them on fire ; the ſmoke of
                    thcſe broke the aim of the garrifon, while it gave no diſturbance to the more
                    diſtant a(Γailants. The beſieging multitude preſſed the attack with incredible
                    obſtinacy and vigour for the ſpace of four hours ; the garrifon was in confuſion
                    ; the officers ſerved the cannon in perfon, and fired their muſkets in the ranks
                    ; the governor, in deſpair, thrice attempted to blow up the fortrefs. A
                    capitulation, when at laſt fought, was refuſed to the garrifon, and an
                    unconditional ſurrender took place. The governor, and M. de Loſme Salbrai his
                    major, a gentleman of diſtinguiſhed humanity and honour, be-came victims of
                    popular fury in ſpite of every effort that could be made for their protection ;
                    but the French guards ſucceeded in procuring the ſafety of the garrifon. only
                    feven priſoners were found in the Baſtile.</p>
                <p>A guard was placed in it, and the keys were ſent to the celebrated M. Briffot de
                    warville, who a few years before had inhabited one of its caverns.</p>
                <p>The remaining part of this eventful day was fpent at Paris in a mixture of
                    triumph and alarm. In the pocket of the governor of the Baſtile a letter was
                    found, encouraging him to reſiſtance by the promiſe of ſpeedy ſuccours, written
                    by M. de Fleffelles, the prevot de marchands, or chief city magiſtrate, who had
                    pretended to be a moſt zealous patriot. This piece of trea-chery was puniſhed by
                    inſtant death ; and his bloody head was carried through the city on a pole,
                    along with, that of M. de Launay. At the approach of night a body of troops
                    advanced towards the city, at the Bar-riere d <hi rend="sup">,</hi> Enfer. The
                    new national guard hurried thither, preceded by a train of artillery, and the
                    troops withdrew upon the firſt fire : barricadoes were everywhere formed, the
                    alarm-bells were rung, and a general illumination continued during the whole of
                    this night of confuſion.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, it was obvious that the new mini-ſtry were entering upon a
                    difficult ſcene of action, where one falſe ſtep might lead to ruin, and where
                    their own plan of conduct ought to be maturely digeſt-ed. Marſhall Broglio was
                    made miniſter of war, the baron de Breteuil preſident of finance, M. de la
                    Gale-ziere comptroller-general, M. de la Porte intendant of the war department,
                    and M. Foulon intendant of the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0159" facs="gri_33125011196389_0165.tif"/>
                <p>navy ; but theſe were onIy meant to act as official men, &gt;under the Count
                    d’ Artois, and the other leaders of the ariſtocracy. To theſe leaders there did
                    not even remain a choice of difficulties ; no refource was left but that of
                    -overawing by military power the national aſſembly and the capital, and of
                    riſking the deſperate meaſure of a national bankruptcy, which the court had not
                    formerly dared to encounter, and to avoid which it had convo-ked the
                    ſtates-general. No trace remains, however, of any attempt to put this criminal,
                    but laſt refource, in execution. The evening after the departure of M. Neckar
                    was ſpent by the court of verfailles in feaſting and joy, as if a victory had
                    been gained. The courtiers of both fexes went round among the foldiery, ſtriving
                    to fecure their fidelity by careſſes, largeſſes, and every fpecies of flattering
                    attention. The miniſtry not only failed to fupport the Prince de Lambeſq in the
                    poſt which he had been ſent to occupy, but they ſuſſered the whole of the 13th
                    to paſs in indeciſion, while the capital was in a ſtate of rebellion, while an
                    army was formally muſtering within its walls, and the names of the principal
                    nobility were put up in lifts of proſcrip-tions. They received the news of the
                    capture of the Baſtile with confuſion and diſmay, which were increa-fed, if
                    poffible, by information given by Marſhal Broglio, that the troops refuſed to
                    act againſt Paris or the national aſſembly. In this perplexity they adopted the
                    miſerable device of concealing from the king the ſtate of public affairs ; and
                    that unfortunate prince was thus perhaps the only perſon out of millions around
                    him who remained ignorant of the convulſions in which his country was involved.</p>
                <p>At length, at midnight, the Duke de Liancourt forced his way into the king’s
                    apartment, and told him of the revolt of his capital, of his army, and of the
                    ſurrender of the fortreſs of the Baſtile. The Count d’ Artois, who was preſent,
                    ſtill attempted to retain the monarch under his fatal deluſion ; but the Duke de
                    Liancourt turning round, exclaimed, " As for you, Sir, yoHr life can only be
                    ſaved by inſtant flight ; I have ſeen with horror your name in the bloody liſt
                    of the profcribed.” Accordingly the Count, with the members of his ſhort-lived
                    adminiſtration and their adhe-rents, fled to the frontiers. And thus an
                    emigration commenced, the fource of that terrible conte It which has covered
                    Europe with bloodſhed and mourning. This miniſtry had, no doubt, many
                    difficulties to contend againſt ; but an accurate attention to their conduct
                    ex-cſtes a ſufpicion which, while it exculpates them from many intended crimes
                    that have been laid to their charge, at the ſame time does little honour to
                    their ta-lents. It is this, that they had come into office without having formed
                    any clear plan of conduct ; that they were men acting without deciſion and at
                    random, and conſequently became the ſport of thoſe events which they wanted
                    ſkill and vigour to direct or controul. By their introduction into office, and
                    their miſconduct while in it, the royal authority fell proſtrate before the
                    popular party in the national aſſenſhly. The nobles and the clergy ſtill
                    remained, but confounded in one aſſembly with the more numerous order of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> tiers état;</hi> and no longer rallying round a throne that
                    was too feeble to afford protection, they foon yielded to that fierce and
                    levelling ſpirit of democracy that now roſe around them.</p>
                <p>But the perſon of the monarch was ſtill beloved.— Early next morning the king
                    went to the aſſembly, but with none of the uſual folemr&gt;ities. He "
                    regretted the commotions of the capital, dtfavowed any knowledge of an intention
                    againſt the perfons of the deputies, and intimated that he had commanded the
                    removal of the troops.” A deep and expreſſive ſilence prevailed for a few
                    moments ; this was ſucceeded by vehement and uni-verſal ſhouts of applaufc. The
                    king aroſe to depart, and inſtantly the whole affembly crowded around, and
                    attended him to his palace. The queen appeared at a balcony with the dauphin in
                    ker arms ; the muſic play-ed the pathetic air of <hi rend="italic">Où peut-on
                        dt <hi rend="sub">re</hi> mieux qu’au fin de ſa ſarndle.</hi> The
                    enthuſiaſm of loyalty communicated itſelf to the ſuriounding multitudes, and
                    nothin"· was heard but acclamations of joy.</p>
                <p>Οη the following day, the king declared his refolu-tion to. viſit the city of
                    Paris in perſon. Accordingly that prince, who never wanted perſonal courage,
                    however deficient he might be in political ſtedfaſtneſs, ſet out, attended by
                    ſome members of the aſſembly and by the militia of verfailles. He was met by the
                    celebrated M. de la Fayette, at the head of a body of the na-tional guard, of
                    which he had now been choſen com-mander in chief. M. Bailly, in whofe perfon the
                    an-cient office of mayor of Paris had been revived, received the king at the
                    gates, and delivered to him the keys. All this while no ſhout was heard from the
                    crowd of innumerable ſpectators but that of <hi rend="italic">Vive la nation.</hi> The king advanced to the Hotel de ville, where the new cockade was
                    preſented to him, which he put on <hi rend="sub">F</hi> and preſented himſelf
                    with it at a window. At the light of this badge of patriotiſm an univerſal ſhout
                    of <hi rend="italic">Vive le Roi</hi> burſt forth from every quarter ; and he
                    returned to verfailles amidſt general triumph and applauſe.</p>
                <p>Much confuſion ſtill prevailed in the capital; but there was more appearance of
                    regularity than could have been expected at the conclufion of ſuch important
                    events. I his aroſe from a caſual concurrence of circumſtances. <hi rend="sup">r</hi> L o conduct with eaſe the elections to the ſtates-general, Paris had
                    been divided into 60 diſtricts, each of which had a feparate place of meeting.
                    The people did not elect the members to the ſtates-general ; but they choſe
                    delegates, who, under the name of elec-toιs, voted for the members. A,t the
                    commencement of the diſturbances, the electors, at the requeſt of their
                    fellow-citizens, aſſumed a temporary authority ; of which, however, they were
                    foon weary, and as foon as poffible procured the public election of 120 perfons
                    as municipal officers for the government of the city. The citizens having got
                    the habit of aſſembling in their diſtricts, grew fond of it : they aſſembled
                    frequently, made rules-for their own government, and ſent commiſſioners to
                    communicate with other diſtricts. The tumultuous nature of theſe meetings, and
                    the vehemence of debate which prevailed in them, will belt be conceived from the
                    ludicrous contrivance of one of their prefidεnts, who ſtationed a drummer at the
                    back of his chair, and when the confuſion and noiſe became altogether
                    ungovernable, gave the ſignal for beating the drum, which ſpeedily overpowered
                    every other noiſe. Theſe meetings, however, gradually ripened into clubs, in
                    which much dexterity and intrigue were exerted.</p>
                <p>The whole of the late miniſtry eſcaped excepting M.</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0160" facs="gri_33125011196389_0166.tif"/>
                <p>Foulon. His character, it may well be imagined, was extremely unpopular ; for he
                    is ſaid to have aſſerted, that he would " make the people of Paris eat hay.” He
                    had retired to the country, but was ſeized by his ■ own vaſſals, and brought to
                    Paris with a bundle of hay <hi rend="sup">:</hi> tied to his back. In ſpite of
                    every effort made by Μ. M. Bailly and Fayette to procure him a fair trial at
                    leaſt, .he was carried to the <hi rend="italic">Place de Gre*υe,</hi> and
                    hanged at a lamp-iron by the enraged multitude. His ſon-ſh-law M. Berthier,
                    attempting to defend himſelf againſt a ſimilar fate, fell, covered with wounds.
                    Their heads were carried round on poles ; and thus the populace became
                    habituated to the fight of blood and murder : they were even taught by popular
                    ſongs to glory in ſuch actions, and particularly by the well known ſong <hi
                        rend="italic"> Ca-ira.</hi></p>
                <p>In conſequence of an invitation from the king, M. Neckar returned to France. He
                    was received by the aſſembly with great applauſe, and in Paris with infinite
                    ſolemnity and triumph. He here, however, committed a political error that made
                    ſome noiſe. In deploring the late exceſſes and murders, and taking notice of the
                    arrcſt of M. Bezenval, an officer of the Swiſs guards, he requeſted of the
                    electors at the Hotel de villc, in a ſolemn harangue, that the paſt ſhould be
                    for-gotten ; that proſcriptions ſhould ceaſe, and a general amneſty be
                    proclaimed. In a moment of enthuſiaſm this was agreed to, and the electors
                    decreed what un-queſtionably exceeded their powers. The diſtricts of Paris were
                    inſtantly in commotion ; the electors alarmed, declared that they only meant
                    that " henceforth the people would puniſh no man but according to law and, at
                    the ſame time, to prove that they themſelves were free from ambition, they
                    formally renounced all their own powers. The aſſembly took up the que-ſtion.
                    Meſſ. Lally, Tolendal, Mounier, Clermont, Tonnerre, Garat junior, and others,
                    declared that no perſon ought to be arreſted without a formal accuſation. while
                    Meſſ. Mirabcau, Robeſpierre, Barnave, and Gleizen, alleged, on the contrary,
                    that the people were entitled to lay hold of any man who had public-ly appeared
                    at the head of their enemies. The debate ended, by admitting the explanation of
                    the electors, and by a declaration that it was the duty of the aſſern-bly to fee
                    juſtice executed in all cafes.</p>
                <p>The commotions and enthuſiaſm of the capital were fpeedily communicated to the
                    provinces. In every quarter the people ſeized upon all the arms that could be
                    found, and the military uniformly refuſed to act againſt them. Many acts of
                    outrage were committed in Brittany, at Straſhourg, in the Lionnois, and
                    elfe-where, in which the nobility were the ſuſſerers. The miſchiefs that
                    occurred were ufually magnified at a diſtance ; but that very circumſtance wa6
                    an additional evil. For example : It was ſtated in the National Affembly that M.
                    de Meſmay, lord of Quincey, invited a number of patriots, among whom were the
                    officers of a neighbouring garrifon, to a fplendid entertainment at his houſe,
                    to celebrate the happy union of the three orders : That in the midſt of the
                    feaſt the maſter of the houſe contrived to withdraw unnoticed, and to ſet fire
                    to a train previouſly laid, which communicated with a quantity of gunpowder in
                    the cellars, in conſequence of which the whole company, by a ſudden exp!ofion,
                    were blown into the air. It w.as found on inquiry, that there was not one word
                    of truth in the whole ſtory. But before this inquiry could be made, all France
                    had reſounded with accounts of the pretended bloody tragedy; and the whole
                    nobility of the kingdom ſuffer-ed in a leſs or greater degree, from the
                    prejudices ex-cited by this unhappy report, the origin of which has never bcen
                    well explained. It would be vain to ſtate all the idle rumours to which at this
                    time the blind credu-lity of the multitude gave currency. At one time, the
                    Ariſtocrates were cutting down the green corn, at an-other time they were
                    burying flour in common ſewers, or caſting loaves into the Seine. One report was
                    no ſooner proved to be falſe than another aroſe, and the whole nation was
                    agitated by ſuſpicion and alarm. The National Aſſembly were engaged in framing
                    their cele-brated declaration of the rights of man, which was to form the baſis
                    of die new conſtitution, when the alarming accounts, received from all quarters,
                    of the ſtate of anarchy into which the kingdom was falling, obliged them
                    ſuddenly to turn their attention to objects of practical neceſlity. The
                    privileged orders found them-ſelves become the objects of univerſal jealoufy and
                    hatred; and that ſomething muſt inſtantly be done to fave their families and
                    property, which were menaced on every ſide with pcrſecution and pillage.
                    Regarding the popular torrent as now become irreſiſtible, to ſave ſomething they
                    reſolved to ſacrifice a part.</p>
                <p>Οη the afternoon fitting of the 4th of Auguſt, the viſcount de Noailles,
                    ſeconded by the Duke d’Aguil-lon, opened one of the moſt important ſcenes in the
                    French Revolution, or in the hiſtory of any conntry. Theſe noblemen ſtated, that
                    the true cauſe of the corn-motions which convulſed the kingdom exiſted in the
                    mi-ſery of the people, who groaned under the double op-preſſion of public
                    contributions and of feudal ſerviqes. “ For three months (ſaid M. de Noailles)
                    the people have beheld us engaged in verbal diſputes, while their own attention
                    and their wiſhes are directed only to things, what is the conſequence ? They are
                    armed to reclaim their rights, and they fee no proſpect of obtaining them but by
                    force.” He therefore propoſed to do juſtice as the ſhorteſt way of reſtoring
                    tranquillity, and for that purpoſe to decree, that henceforth every tax ſhould
                    be impoſed in proportion to the wealth of the contributors, and that no order of
                    the ſtate ſhould be exempted from the payment of public burdens ; that feudal
                    claims ſhould be redeemed at a fair valuation ; but that ſuch claims as
                    conſiſted of perſonal ſervices on the part of the vaſſal ſhould be aboliſhed
                    without com-penſation, as contrary to the impreſcriptible rights of man. The
                    extenſive poſſeffions of the noblemen who made theſe propoſals added much luſtre
                    to the diſinte-reſted facrifice which they offered. Their fpeeches were received
                    with the moſt enthuſiaſtic applauſes by the Aſſembly and the galleries, and
                    their propoſals were decreed by acclamation without a vote. No nation is ſo much
                    led by the influence of ſudden emotions as the French. The patriotic contagion
                    now ſpread faſt through eveιy breaſt, and a conteſt of generoſity enſued. The
                    hereditary juriſdictions poſſeſſed by the nobles within their own territories
                    were next ſacvificed. All places and penſions granted by the Court were
                    fup-preſled, unleſs granted as the reward of merit or of actual ſervices. The
                    game laws, which condemned the huſhandman, under ſevere penalties, to leave his
                    proper-</p>

                <p>ty a prey to infinite multitudes of animals reſerved for paſtime, had always
                    been numbered among the ſevere grievances of the French peaſantry. Theſe were
                    therefore renounced, along with the excluſive rights of rabbit warrens,
                    ſiſheries, and dovecotes. The fale of offices was aboliſhed, and the fees
                    exacted from the poor, together with the privilege of holding a plurality of
                    livings, were relinquiſhed by the clergy. The deputies of the <hi rend="italic">Pais d’Etat,</hi> or privileged provinces, with the deputies of Dauphiné at
                    their head, next came forward, and offered a ſurrender of their ancient
                    privileges, re-queſting that the kingdom might no longer remain parcelled out
                    among Dauphinois, Bretons, Provençaux, &amp;c. but that they ſhould all form
                    one great mafs of French citizens. They were followed by the reprefentatives of
                    Paris, Marſeilles, Lyons, Bourdeaux, Straſfeourg, &amp;c. who requeſted
                    leave to renounce all their feparate privileges as incorporations, for the fake
                    of placing every man and every village in the nation upon a footing of equality.
                    Thus the Aſſembly proceeded, till every member had exhauſted his imagination
                    upon the ſubject of reform. To cloſe the whole, the Duc de Liancourt propoſed
                    that a ſolemn <hi rend="italic">Te Deιιm</hi> ſhould be performed, that a
                    medal ſhould be ſtruck in commemoration of the events of that night ; and that
                    the title of Restorer of Gallic Liberty ſhould be beſtowed upon the reigning
                    monarch. A deputation was accordingly ap-pointed to wait upon the king,
                    refpectfully to inform him of theſe decrees.</p>
                <p>Several ſucceeding days were neceſſary to form into laws the decrees of the 4tl1
                    Auguſt, and commitees were appointed to make out reports for that purpoſe. Οηε
                    of theſe reports having included the tithes and revenues of the clergy among the
                    abuſes that were to be done away, and having propofed in lieu of them to grant a
                    "certain ſtipend to the different miniſters of religion to be payable by the
                    nation, the clergy attempted to make a Hand in defence of their property, and
                    violent debates enſued. In theſe they were ably ſupported by the Abbé Sieyes :
                    but as the clergy had formerly deferted the nobles, ſo they were now in their
                    turn abandoned to their fate by the hereditary ariſtocracy. The popular party
                    had long regarded the wealth of the church as an eaſy reſource for fupplying the
                    wants of the ſtate.— Never was there a more complete proof of the influence of
                    opinion over the affairs of men. The Catholic clergy of France, though poffeffed
                    of more property than they enjoyed at the time when princes took up arms or laid
                    them down at their command, now found ſo few defenders, that they were terrified
                    into a voluntary ſurrender of all that they and their predeceffors had poffeffed
                    for ages. In their overthrow, they ſcarcely enjoyed even the barren honour of
                    having fallen the laſt of thoſe privileged orders that ſo long had ruled over
                    this ancient kingdom. They and the nobles, and the king, ſtill poſſeſled their
                    former titles and nominal dignity ; but all of them were now ſubdued, and at the
                    mercy of the commons of France, who ſpeedily diſ-miſſtd them at their pleaſure.</p>
                <p>As a ſhort ſeaſon of tranquillity in the Court and the National Aſſembly
                    ſucceeded theſe great popular ſacri-fices, the King laid hold of it as a fit
                    opportunity for the appointment of a new miniſtry. They conſiſted of the
                    Archbiſhop of vienne, the Archbiſhop of Bour-deaux, M. Neckar, the Count de St
                    Prieſt, Count de</p>
                <p>Montmorin, the Count de Ia Luzerne, and the Count de la Tour du Pin Paulin. M.
                    Ncckar, as miniſter of finance, having ſtated the diſtreſſed fituation of the
                    revenue, preſented the plan of a loan of thirty millions of livres. But M.
                    Mirabeau, from a ſpirit of rivalſhip, as if would feem, to M. Neckar, prevailed
                    with the Affembly to alter and to narrow the conditions of it in ſuch a degree
                    that very few ſubſcribers were found, and the loan could not be filled up. This
                    failure involved the Aſſembly in a conſiderable degree of unpopularity; in
                    conſcquence of which they allowed M. Neckar to preſcribe his own terms for the
                    purpoſe of obtaining a loan of eighty millions. But the happy inſtant of pub-lic
                    confidence had been allowed to paſs away, and this loan was never more than half
                    filled up. Recourſe was next had to patriotic contributions; and great numbers
                    of gold rings, ſilver buckles, and pieces of plate, were preſented to the
                    Aſſembly. The Royal family themſelves ſent their plate to the mint, either to
                    give counte-nance to theſe donations, or, as M. Neckar has ſince aſſerted,
                    through abſolute neceſſity, for the purpoſe of fupporting themſelves and their
                    family. The confuſion into which the nation had been thrown by the late events
                    had produced a ſuſpenſion of the payment of all taxes. There exiſted, in fact,
                    no efficient government; and if ſociety eſcaped entire diſſolution, it was
                    merely in conſequence of thoſe habits of order which are produced by a ſtate of
                    long continued civilization. The buſineſs of government could not be tranſacted
                    without money, and many vain efforts were made by the mini-ſtry to procure it.
                    At length M. Neckar was driven to the deſperate refource of propoiing a <hi
                        rend="italic"> compulfory loan,</hi> or that every individual poffeffed of
                    property ſhould advance to the ſtate a ſum equal to one-fourth of his an-nual
                    income. This bold propoſition was fupported by Mirabeau, and adopted by the
                    Aſſembly ; but it does not appear to have ever been effectually executed.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the Aſſembly was buſily occupied in framing the celebrated
                    declaration of the <hi rend="italic">Rights oſ Man,</hi> which was afterwards
                    prefixed to the new conſtitution. This was followed by the diſcuſſion of a point
                    of much delicacy and difficulty ; viz. what ſhare of le-giſlative authority the
                    king ought to poſſeſs under the new conſtitution ; whether an abſolute negative
                    or <hi rend="italic">veto,</hi> a ſuſpenſive <hi rend="italic">veto,</hi> or
                    no <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> at all ? This queſtion opera-ted like a
                    touchſtone for trying the ſentiments of eve-ry perſon ; and the aſſembly,
                    confiſting of 1200 men, was now ſeen to arrange itſelf into two violent
                    contending factions. The debates were vehement and tumultuous, and continued for
                    many days. As the aſſembly fat in public, and as multitudes of people of all
                    deſcrip-tions were admitted into the galleries, and even into the body of the
                    hall among the members, many indecent ſcenes took place in conſequence oſ the
                    interference of the ſpectators to applaud or cenſure the ſenti-mtfnts which were
                    delivered. Thus the public at large became ſpeedily intereſted in the diſcuſſion
                    ; the city "of Paris took a ſide in oppofition to the <hi rend="italic">veto,</hi> and the whole empire was thrown into agitation by new and ſpeculative
                    queſtions. The diſtinguiſhed place which France holds among the nations of
                    Europe rendered theſe ſingular events and diſcuſſions the object of univerſal
                    attention. The contagious love of novelty ſpread rapidly abroad, and gave rife
                    to that well-founded jea-louſy on the part of the monarchs of Europe, which</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0162" facs="gri_33125011196389_0168.tif"/>
                <p>was ſpeedily to burſt forth in a bloody tempeſt.—In the preſent cafe, the people
                    oſ Paris became moſt eager-ly intereſted. Rumours of plots were ſpread through
                    the country, and a new ſtorm was obviouſly gathering, when the queſtion was thus
                    got quit of. M. Mounier remarked, that the executive power could poffeſs no
                    negativc againſt the decrees of the preſent aſſembly, which had been nominated
                    by the nation with ſuprem£ powers for the expreſs purpoſe of framing a
                    conſtitu-tion, which was to remain binding over all orders of men. in the ſtate
                    ; and with regard to future legiſlatures, the king declared by a meſſage, that
                    he wiſhed to poſſefe no more than a <hi rend="italic">ſuſpenfive veto.</hi> It
                    is remarkable that the popular Mirabeau concluded a fpeech in favour of the
                    abſolute <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> of the crown with thefe words, " Tlιat it
                    would be better to live in Conſtantinople than in France, if laws could be made
                    without the royal function.” This political adventurer is, however, accufed of
                    having taken care to circulate in Paris a report that he had oppoſed the <hi
                        rend="italic"> veto</hi> with all his influence ; and to give credit to the
                    ſtory, he is ſaid to have quitted the aſſembly juſt before the diviſion, that
                    his vote might not appear on record againſt it.</p>
                <p>In the debates about the <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> the month of Auguſt was
                    ſpent ; and in the beginning of September a new conſtitutional queſtion was
                    prefented to the aſſembly by one of its numerous committees. This was, whether
                    the legiſlative body ought to conſiſt of one or of two chambers ? Mounier,
                    Lally, Tollendal, Clermont Tonnerre, and others, who were zealous lovers of
                    freedom upon what were then accounted moderate principles, ſupported eagerly the
                    idea of eſtabliſhing two independent chambers in imitation of the Brſtiſh
                    conſtitution ; but they were deſerted both by the democratic and ariſtocratic
                    parties. The firſt of theſe re-garded an upper houſe or ſenate as a refuge for
                    the o!d ariſtocracy, or as the cradle of a new one ; while the higher nobles and
                    clergy feared leſt ſuch an arrange-ιnent might prevent the future
                    re-eſtabliſhment of the ancient diviſion into three orders. Οί ιοοο members who
                    voted, only 89 fupported the propofal for dividing the legiſlature into two
                    chambers.</p>
                <p>Soon after this, the king gave his fonction to the important decrees of the 4tl1
                    of Auguſt, but not with-. out ſome heſitation, and expreffing doubts of the
                    wiſdom of ſome of them in a letter to the aſſembly. At the fame time the <hi
                        rend="italic"> inviolability</hi> of the perſon of the monarch was decreed,
                    the indiviſibility of the throne, and its hereditary deſcent from male to male
                    in the reigning family.—But we ſhall not here attempt to enter into a detail of
                    the various articles of the new conſti-tution as connected with the
                    circumſtances under which they became the ſubject of debate, we ſhall only ſtate
                    thoſe more remarkable circumſtances which tend to aſ-certain the peculiar
                    changes which the ſentiments of the nation underwent in the progreſs of a
                    revolution the moſt remarkable that occurs in human hiſtory.</p>
                <p>In confequence oſ the debates upon the queſtions of the <hi rend="italic">veto</hi> and the two chambers, the minds of parties had become much irritated.
                    Paris wore the fome threatening afpect that it had done in the months of June
                    and of July preceding ; and every thing feemed tending towards an important
                    criſis. The ariſtocratiq party accuſed their antagoniſts of a deſign to excite
                    ¢ew inſurrections j and the charge was retorted, by cir</p>
                <p>culating a report that a plot for conveying the king to</p>
                <p>Metz was already ripe for execution.</p>
                <p>From the period 0f the defection of the French, guards, who were now in the pay
                    of the capital, the protection of the royal family had been entruſted to thes
                    militia or national guard of Verfailles, together with the regiment of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> gardes du corps,</hi> which was compoſed entirely of
                    gentlemen. Upon the circulation of the report of the intended flight of the
                    king, the French guards, began to wi∏ι to be reſtored to their ancient
                    employment of attending his perſon, for the purpoſe of preventing any attempt of
                    this nature. This idea was eagerly cheriihed by the capital ; and, in ſpite of
                    every effort uſed by M. de la Fayette, the obvious appearance of approaching
                    diſturbances could not be prevented. The popular party fow the advan-tages which
                    they would derive from placing the aſſem* bly and the king in the midſt of that
                    turbulent metro-polis which had given birth to -the revolution, an&lt;L upon
                    the attachment of which they could moſt ſecurely depend. Every encouragement was
                    therefore given-by the moſt active leaders of what was now called the. <hi
                        rend="italic"> Democratic</hi> party to the project of eſtabliihing the
                    court at Paris. The miniſtry were under no finall degree of alarm ; and the
                    count d’ Eſtaing, who commanded the national guard of Verfailles, requeſted the
                    aid of an. additional regiment. The regiment of Flanders was. accordingly lent
                    for : its arrival caufed no ſmall degree of anxiety and every effort was
                    inſtantly made, to gain over both officers and ſoldiers to the popular cauſe.</p>
                <p>Οη the ſirſt of october the garde du corps, probably for the purpoſe of
                    ingratiating tb.emſelves with the newly arrived regiment, and perhaps to attach
                    them more· ſteadily to the royal cauſe, invited the officers of the regiment of
                    Flanders to a public entertainment. Several officers of the national guard, and
                    others of the military, were invited. Tlie entertainment was given in the opera
                    houſe adjoining to the palace ; ſeveral loyal toaſts were drank; but it is
                    aſſerted, that when the fa-vυurite popular toεit <hi rend="italic">The Nation</hi> was given, it was-rejected by the gardes du corps. In ordinary cafes,,
                    ſuch a trifling circumſtance as this, or even any other of the tranſactions of a
                    night of feſtivity,. would' juſtly be regarded as unworthy of notice in
                    recording thç more remarkable events in the hiſtory of a great nation ; but ſuch
                    was now the ſingular ſtate of affairs», that the moſt trivial occurrences were
                    inſtruroental, by their combination, in the production of important
                    con-ſequences. The queen, having ieen from a window of the palace the gaiety
                    which prevailed among the military, prevailed- with the king,, who-was juif
                    returned, from huntings to viſit tÉem along with herfelf and the dauphin. Their
                    ſudden appearance in. the foloon kin-dled in an inſtant the ancient euthuſiaſra
                    of French..-loyalty. The grenadiers of the regiment of Flanders, along with the
                    Swifs chaſſeurs, had been admitted to» the defert ; and they, as well as their
                    officers, drank, the health of the King, Queen, and Dauphin, with their ſwords
                    drawn. The royal family having bowed, with po∙ liteneſs to the company,
                    retired.—Οί all nations, the French are moſt liable to the influence of ſudden
                    im-∙ preflions: the muſic played the favourite air, <hi rend="italic">0 Ricard</hi> <hi rend="italic">L</hi> <hi rend="italic">0 mon Roi ! (univers (abandonne,</hi> " Ο Richard ! Ο my
                    king ! the world abandons thee.” In the eagerneſs of</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0163" facs="gri_33125011196389_0169.tif"/>
                <p>loyalty, the national cockade, which had been adopted by fome of the gardes du
                    corps, was thrown aſide, and white cockades were ſupplied as quickly as they
                    could be made by the ladies of the court.</p>
                <p>When thefe events were next day reported at Paris, accompanied by a multitude of
                    exaggerations, they gave rife to the moſt violent alarm. The capital was at that
                    time ſuſſering all the horrors of famine ; and in ſuch a fituation, the news of
                    a feaſt which others have enjoyed, ſeldom gives much pleafure to hungry men. To
                    the former report of an intended flight on the part of the royal family, it was
                    now added, that a counter revolution was fpeedily to be attempted by force of
                    arms ; and that the preſent fcarcity was artificially cre-ated by the court for
                    the purpoſe of reducing the peo-ple to fubmiſſion. Their ariſtocratic
                    antagoniſts have fince aſſerted, that the famine was indeed artificial ; but
                    that it was created by a portion of the violent party in the national aſſembly,
                    which was then denominated the <hi rend="italic">Cabal,,</hi> whoſe object was
                    to excite commotions as the means of procuring an opportunity of ſetting the
                    duke of orleans at the head of the ſtate, either as regent, or in ſome other
                    form. To this laſt party Mirabeau is faid to have belonged.</p>
                <p>For four days no notice was taken in the aſſembly of ■what had paffed at the
                    entertainment given by the gardes du corps. Οη the 5th of october M. Petion
                    mentioned it for the firſt time, and a violent debate enfued; during which
                    Mirabeau rofe and exclaimed, “ Declare that the king’s perfon <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> is ſacred, and I rnyfelf will bring forward an impeachment
                    thereby alluding to the conduct of the queen. while this debate wa3 pro-ceeding
                    at verſaillcs, the city of Paris was in commotion. A vaſt multitude of women of
                    the loweſt rank, with fome men in womens clothes, had aſſem-bled at the <hi
                        rend="italic"> Hotel de Ville,</hi> and were ca∏ing aloud for arms and
                    bread. They reſolved to proceed inſtantly to verfailles to demand bread from the
                    king and from the national aſſembly. La Fayette oppυfed them in vain; for his
                    own ſoldiers refufed to turn their bayonets againſt the women. Upon this one
                    Staniſlaus Mail-lard, who had diſtinguiſhed himſelf at the taking of the
                    Baſtile, offered himſelf as a leader to the inſurgents. He had the addveſs to
                    prevail with them to lay aſide ſuch arms as they had procured; and he ſet out
                    for ∖er-failles about noon with as much order among his fυl-Iowers as could well
                    be expected from ſuch an aſſenp blage. Either becaufe the paſſion for going to
                    Verfailles had ſuddenly become too infectious to be reſiſted, or becaufe the
                    multitude already gone thither was now ac-counted dangerous, the mayor and
                    municipality of Pa-ris thought fit to give υrdeιs to la Fayette inſtantly to ſet
                    out for that place at the head of the national guard.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, Maillard approached verfailles with his tumultuous troop ; he
                    arranged them in three diviſions, and perfiiaded them to behave with tolerable
                    decency. The king was hunting in the woods of Mendon when he was informed of the
                    arrival of a moſt formidable band of women calling aloud for bread. " Alas !
                    (replied he) if I had it, I ſhould not wait to be aſked.” Maillard entered the
                    aſſembly accompa-nied by a deputation of his followers to ſtate the ob-ject of
                    their journey. The aſſembly, to pacify them, feat a deputation of their own
                    number along with them to</p>
                <p>lay their complaints before the king. His majeſty recei-ved the whole with great
                    politeneſs, and readily agreed to go into any meaſures for the fupply of the
                    capital that could be ſuggeſted. The report of this behaviour had fuch an effect
                    upon the multitude collected around the palace, that they began to difperſe ;
                    but they were ſpeedily fucceeded by another croud not lefs numerous. A ſudden
                    refolution of flight ſeems now to have been propoſed by the court ; for the
                    king’s carriages were brought to the gate of the palace which communicatee with
                    the orangry : but the ħational guard of Verfailleβ refuſed to allow them to
                    paſs, and the king himſelf refufed to remove, or to allow any blood to be ſhed
                    in his cauſe.</p>
                <p>La Fayette with his army at length arrived about 10 o’clock at night, and found
                    the aſſembly in a very unpleaſant ſituation. Their hall and galleries were
                    crowded by the Parifian fiſh-women and others of the mob, who, at eveιy inſtant,
                    interrupted the debates. La Fayette waited upon the king, and informed him of
                    the proceedings of the day, planted guards in every quarter ; and after a ſcanty
                    banquet had been procured for the multitude, he prevailed with the aſſembly to
                    clofe their fitting for the night. In this laſt part of his conduct M. la
                    Fayette has been much cenfured, and probably not without reaſon ; for it could
                    ſcarcely be expected that ſuch a night would be ſpent in peace by the immenſe
                    aſſemblage of turbulent characters that were now brought together. All was
                    quiet, however, till about fix in the morning of the 6th, when a great number of
                    women anddefperate perſons ruſhed forward to the palace, and attempted to force
                    their way into it. Two of the gardes du corps were killed ; the croud aſcend¢d
                    the ſtair-caſe leading to the queen’s apartment, but were bravely reſiſted by M.
                    Miemandre a ſentinel, who gave the alarm, and defended his poll till he fell
                    covered with wounds, of which, however, he afterwards fortunately recovered. The
                    ruffians, reeking with his blood, ruſhed into the chamber of the queen, and
                    pierced with bayonets and poniards the bed whence this</p>
                <p>perſecuted woman had but juft time to fly almoſt naked, and, through ways
                    unknown to the murderers, had eſca-ped to ſeek refuge at the feet of the king,
                    who w as al-ready alarmed, and had gone to feek her.</p>
                <p>Ί he tumult became more violent every moment, and fudden death feemed to
                    threaten the royal family ; but la Fayette was by this time at the head of his
                    troops, whom he befecched earneſtly to ſave the gardes du corps from maffacre.
                    In this he was ſuccefsful ; ſome that had been taken priſoners were ſurrounded
                    by the grenadiers of the French guards who protected them, and the retreat of
                    the whole corps was eaſily ſecured. The croud was fpeediſy driven from the
                    different quar-ters of the palace, which they were already beginning to pillage;
                    and the royal family ventured to ſhow them-felves at a balcony. A few voices now
                    exclaimed* <hi rend="italic">Le Roi à Paris,</hi> " the King to Paris.” Ιhe
                    ſhout be-came general ; and the king, after conſulting with la Fayette, declared
                    that he had no objection to take up his reſidence at Paris, provided he was
                    accompanied by the queen and his children, when the propoſal was reported to the
                    aſſembly, the popular leaders expreſſed much ſatisſaction. Ι'hey ordered a
                    deputation of 100 members to attend the king thither; they voted the national
                    aſſembly inſeparable from the king. His majeſty</p>

                <p>ſct out at two o’clock a prifoner in the cuſtody of the mob. Two gentlemen were
                    felected from his body guard, and, with all the parade of an execution, beheaded
                    in the court of his palace. Their heads were ſtuck upon fpears, and led the
                    proceſſion ; whilſt the royal captives who followed in the train, and beheld
                    this fpectacle, were conducted fυ ſlowly, that a ſhort journey of twelve miles
                    was protracted to fix hours. The king, the queen, and their children, were
                    lodged in the old palace of the Louvre, while Monſieur went to reſide at the
                    Luxemburg. The city was illumina-ted, and the evening fpent in triumph by the
                    Pari-ſians.</p>
                <p>The removal of the king to Paris was regarded as a triumph by the popular party.
                    The higher order of nobles conſidered it as completely ruinous to their hopes ;
                    and even many men of talents, ſuch as Mounier and Lally Tollendal, whom we
                    cannot avoid regarding as friends to the popular cauſe in its out-ſet, now
                    re-gardcd every profpect of attaining a happy conflit ution-al freedom as at an
                    end, as the national reprefentatives muff be for ever expυfed to the inſults,
                    and overawed by the influ&lt;gιce, of a turbulent capital. Many members of
                    the affembly took refuge in foreign countries, and uſed every effort to excite
                    the other nations of Europe to lioſtility againſt France. As the duke of odeans
                    had been regarded as a chief agent in promoting the late diſturbances, the
                    marquis de la Fayette waited upon him, and inſiſted upon his leaving the kingdom
                    for a time. The duke was overawed, and, on pretence of public buſineſs, went to
                    England, where he remained for ſeveral months.</p>
                <p>Οη the i gth of october, the National Aſſembly held its firſt ſeſſion in Paris.
                    The King was clofely guarded in his own palace ; and no apparent oppoſition now
                    ſtood in the way to prevent the popular party from giving to their country ſuch
                    a conſtitution as they might judge expedient. Much, however, was yet to be done,
                    and many difficulties remained, reſulting from the habits of men educated under
                    a very different order of things. Two days after the Affembly came to Paris, a
                    baker was publicly.executed by the mob, upon a falſe accuſation of having
                    concealed a quantity of bread.— while the Affembly was at a diſtance, events of
                    this nature had been little attended to, and the leading party avoided
                    attempting to check theſe ebullitions of popular violence, from which they had
                    derived fo much advantage ; but that party was now all-powerful, and ſo flagrant
                    an offence committed againſt the law was regarded as an inſnlt upon the
                    ſovereignty of the National Affembly. Two leaders of the mob were therefore
                    tried and publicly executed, and a ſevere law was paffed, of the nature of the
                    Britiſh riot act, authoriſing the magiſtrates to act by military force againſt
                    any multitude of perſons that ſhould refuſe to diſperſe. Thus the peace of the
                    capital was ſecured for ſeveral months; but in the country at large no ſmall
                    degree of anxiety and trouble ſtill ſubſiſted. The ſame ſufpicious temper which
                    had prevailed at Paris agitated the provinces with the dread of plots and
                    monopolies oſ grain. Add to this, that the nobleſſe in the country were by no
                    means ſatisſied with the liberality with which their reprefentatives had on the
                    4th of Auguſt voted away their privileges and their property. This produced
                    violent jealoufies between the peaſants and their lords,</p>
                <p>and gradually conveyed to every corner of the kingdom the political ferment
                    which had commenced at Paris.</p>
                <p>The National Aſſembly being now, however, in to-lerable ſecurity, proceeded in
                    the arduous attempt of forming a free conſtitution for the great empire of
                    France. The Abbé Sieyes preſented a plan for dividing the kingdom into 83 <hi
                        rend="italic"> departments,</hi> of about 324 fquare leagues, and of each
                    department into feve-ral <hi rend="italic">difiricts,</hi> and each diſtrict
                    was ſubdivided into <hi rend="italic">cantons</hi> of four ſquare leagues in
                    extent. Thus the whole of the ancient diviſions of the kingdom into governments,
                    generalities, and bailiewicks, was in an inſtant obliterated. An attempt was
                    alſo made to Amplify in an equal degree the relative ſituation of individuals in
                    civil life, by a decree which put an end to all diſtinction of orders and
                    immunities, ſo far as any privilege whatever was concerned. At the ſame time, a
                    bold and moſt im-portant meaſure was adopted, which has lince proved the organ
                    of thoſe terrible efforts which France has been enabled to make againſt the reft
                    of Europe. This was the conſiſcation of the whole of the lands belonging to the
                    church, for the purpoſe of ſupplying the exigencies of the ſtate. In this
                    tranſaction, all regard to juſtice was thrown aſide. The lands of the church
                    were as certainly the property of the then poſſeiſors of them as any entailed
                    eſtate among us is the property of him who occupies it. The ſtate may have had a
                    right to appropriate to itſelf the church lands upon the death of the incumbents
                    ; but it might with equal juſtice, and perhaps greater propriety, have ſeized
                    the enormous re-venues of the Duke of Qrleans, as have confifcated a ſingle acre
                    belonging to the moſt ufelefs abbot without his own conſent. This nefarious
                    meafure was pro--poſed by the biſhop of Autun, M. Tallegrand Peri-gord, a man of
                    no religion, who had been promoted to the bench in a moſt irregular manner to
                    ſerve this very purpoſe. The mode in which this property was to be expended was
                    by iſſuing affiguments <hi rend="italic">(affignats)</hi> upon it; which
                    aſſignments were to be received by the ſtate for the payment of taxes, or for
                    the purchaſe of church lands when ſet up to ſale. A proviſion was at the ſame
                    time made for the national clergy, who were for the future to be paid by the
                    ſtate. Qn the day following that on which this important meaſure was adopted, a
                    decree was paffed, ſuſpending the parliaments of the kingdom from the exerciſe
                    of their functions.</p>
                <p>Decrees, in which the intereſts of ſo vaſt a multitude of individuals were
                    involved, could not be carried into effect without much murmuring and
                    oppoſition. the parliaments, in particular, began to exert themſelves with
                    vigour, and, by proteſts and other publications, attempted to invalidate the
                    decrees of the Aſſembly as illegal ; but theſe privileged bodies, who had often
                    been accuſtomed to contend with fome ſuccefs againſt the deſpotic adminiſtration
                    of their country, and 011 that account had been for ages the objects of public
                    ap-plauſe, now found themfelves utterly forfaken, and unable to reſiſt the
                    mandate of a popular Aſſembly. After a few fruitleſs ſtruggles, they were all of
                    them under the neceſſity of ſubmitting to their fate.</p>
                <p>Nothing remarkable now .occurred for ſome time.— The Aſſembly proceeded to
                    organize the kingdom by the eſtabliſhment of municipalities, and by reforming
                    the juriſprudence of the country. It is to bc obferved, however, that when the
                    parliament of Paris was abo-</p>

                <p>Iiſhed, the Châtelet, being the Γecond court in that city, was retained for the
                    purpoſe of trying thoſe per-fons who had become moſt obnoxious by their
                    attach-ment to the royal cauſe. This court had the lpirit to acquit the Baron de
                    Bezenval, Marſhal Broglio, and the Prince de Lambeſq. But having incurred much
                    popular odium c∙n this account, they were guilty of the unworthy meanneſs of
                    condemning to death the Marquis de Favres, for a pretended conſpiracy (of which
                    no tolerable proof was ever brought) to maffacre La Fayette, Bailly, and Neckar,
                    and to convey the King to Peronne.</p>
                <p>During the whole of this winter the King had been very ſtrictly watched by
                    numerous guards placed around his palace, infomuch that the other nations of
                    Europe conſidered him as in a ſtate of captivity. To do away this impreffion, if
                    poffible, and to make their king appear a voluntary agent in the meaſures that
                    had lately been adopted, was now regarded as a matter of ſome importance. Every
                    effort was therefore made to prevail with him to come to the Affembly ſuddenly,
                    and, as it were, of his own voluntary motion, there to declare his adherence to
                    the meafures which had lately been adopted. For ſome time he refilled this
                    propo-ſal ; but at length, on the 4tl1 of February, he did ſuddenly appear in
                    the National Affembly, where he complained of the attempts that had been made to
                    ſhake the new conſtitution. He declared his wiſh " that it ſhould be univerſally
                    known that the monarch and the reprefentatives of the nation were united, and
                    their wiſhes were the fame ; that he would defend the conſtitutional liberty of
                    the ſtate; that, in conjunction with the Queen, he would early form the
                    ſentiments of his foil fυι that new order of things which the circumſtan-ces of
                    the empire had introduced.” This declaration diſpirited the ariſtocratic party
                    in no ſmall degree, and increaſed that unhappy tendency of looking for aid from
                    foreign countries which they had always been too apt to indulge.</p>
                <p>Ο11 the 13th of February, monaſtic eſtabhſhments were ſuppreffed, and their
                    lands conſiſcated ; but the preſent friars and nuns were allowed penſtons for
                    their ſubſtſtenee, and to continue the obſervance of their mo-naſtic vows, if
                    they thought fit. we may obſerve here, that, in conſequence of the evacuation of
                    the monaſte-ries, it is probable that about this time the <hi rend="italic">Breton</hi> committee began to affume the appellation of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> (facobiη Club,</hi> from the hall belonging to the Jacobin
                    friars at Paris, in which their meetings were now held.</p>
                <p>An event occurred at this time which tended in no ſmall degree to increafe the
                    odium under which the old government already laboured. This was the publication
                    of the <hi rend="italic">Red Book,</hi> or-lift of penſions and donations
                    granted by the crown. In conſequence of the moſt preffing inftances, it had been
                    communicated by M. Neckar to a committee of the Affembly, after many intreaties,
                    and the moſt ſolemn promiſes of ſecrecy. ft aſtorded, however, too ſtriking an
                    advantage to the popular party not to be made uſe of, and in a few days M.
                    Neckar, to his no ſmall ſurpriſe, ſaw this regiſter publicly fold by every
                    bookſeller in Paris. He ought not, indeed, to have been ſurpriſed ; and the
                    giving up of this lift is one of the many proofs which the tranſactions of that
                    period afford of his great unfitneſs for the office which he held, with much
                    indignation, however, he demanded why the committee had publiſhed it without the
                    permiſſion of the Affembly or the King ? But he was told by the committee, that
                    " as to the Affembly, they were ſufe of its approbation ; and as to the King,
                    they were not his reprefentatives.” To give an idea of ~ħ the effect of this
                    publication, it is only neceſſiiry to re-P? mark, that, under the ſhort
                    adminiſtration of M. Ca-lonne, the two brothers of the King had received from
                    the public treaſury, independent of their legitimate in-come, nearly two
                    millions ſteiling, and that L. 600,000 had been granted to an individual,
                    becauie he was the liuſhand of Madame de Polignac. M. Neckar’s oppoſition to
                    this publication tended in no ſmall degree to injure his popularity, and the
                    reft of the miniſtry began to lofe the confidence of the public. Indeed, at this
                    time, fertile cauſes of alarm prevailed on all ſides. T&lt;he clergy were
                    attempting to revive in the provinces the ancient animoſities between the Roman
                    Catholics and the Protεftants, aſcribing the late decrees of the Affembly to the
                    latter. The German Princes who poſ-ſtffed property in the north of France were
                    complaining loudly of the violation oſ their rights by the aboli-tiυn of the
                    feudal ſyſtem, although the National Affembly had voted to them a compenſation.
                    The moſt melancholy intelligence was received from their colonies in the well
                    Indies. In regulating theſe, the Affembly had not recognized the right of the
                    free negroes to enjoy the fame privileges with other citizens ; at the fame
                    time, they did not go the length of denying theſe privileges. This uncertain
                    conduct produced infinite calamities. The whites contended with thoſe commonly
                    called <hi rend="italic">people oſ colour.</hi> Theſe again ſometimes Hood in
                    oppoſition to the free negroes, or to the ſiaves ; and hence it ſometimes
                    happened that no leſs than three ho-ſtile affemblies were held at the fame time
                    in the fame colony, which made war upon each other with the moſt</p>
                <p>inveterate fury. Each party found protectors in the National Affembly of the
                    parent ſtate. Thoſe who favoured or oppoſed the exiſtence of diſtinctions at
                    home, in general followed out the fame principle with regard to the colonies.</p>
                <p>Οη the 14th of May, M. de Montmorency communicated to the National Affembly the
                    preparations for war in which England and Spain were engaged. This brought
                    forward the conſtitutional queſtion, “ who ought to poffeſs the power of
                    declaring peace and war ? The Count Clermont Tonnerre, Meffrs <hi rend="sup">,</hi> &lt;de Serent,VÎ-rieu, and Dupont, ſupported the royal prerogative ;
                    while on the other fide, the excluſive right of the legiſia-tive body to
                    exerciſe this important prerogative was ſupported by Meſtrs d’Aiguillon,
                    Garatjun. Freteau, Jellot, Charles Lameth, Sillery, Pction, Robeſpierre,
                    &amp;c. M. Petion propoſed a decree “ that the French nation renounced for
                    ever all idea of conqueſt, and confined itſelf entirely to defenſive war;” which
                    was paffed with univerſal acclamation. The Count de Mirabeau at length
                    ſucceſsfully propoſed that peace and war ſhould. be declared by the king and the
                    legiſlative body in conjunction ; and the decree that was paffed on the ſubject
                    is a ſtrange farrago of contradictions and abſurdities. It enjoined the King· to
                    " guard the Rate from external attacks.” But how could this be done, without
                    repelling any attack that might be made upon it ? This, however, he could not
                    do, without previouſly informing the National Affembly j ⅛nd if th»t body
                    chanced.</p>

                <p>not to he fitting at the time, he was bound to let the enemy advance without
                    oppoſition till he had convened his orators, diſpcrſed over 24,000 ſquare
                    leagues, and liſtened to their metaphyſical quibbles in Paris.</p>
                <p>On the 19th June, a very ſingular farce was acted in the Aſſembly. A Pruſſian
                    refugee, who called himſelf Anacharſis Clouts, and who was ſtruggling hard to
                    bring himſelf into public notice, on an evening fitting (which, it is to be
                    obſerved, was generally ill attended by the perfons of the higheſt rank),
                    introduced to the Aſſembly a number of perſons dreffed in the different habits
                    of all the different .countries that could he thought of. In a formal harangue,
                    he told the Aſſembly that lie was come, as the <hi rend="italic">orator oſ the
                        human race,</hi> at the head of the reprefentatives of all nations, to
                    congratulate them upon the formation of their new conſtitution. He was anſwered
                    by the Preſident with abundance of ſolemnity, and retired with his motley
                    groupe. This fantaſtical piece of folly, which in any other country than France
                    would ſcarcely, perhaps, have excited a ſmile, was treated by the Aſſembly in a
                    ferions light. Alexander Lameth propoſed, that the figures of different nations
                    exhibited in chains at the feet of Louis XIV. ſhould be dellroyed as an inſult
                    upon mankind. M. Lamhel, a lawyer, at this moment propofed the <hi rend="italic"
                        > abolition oſ all hereditary titles.</hi> He was iιιpported by La Fayette,
                    St Fargeau, and the viſcount de Noailles. The decree was paffed, along with
                    another ſuppreſſing all armorial bearings. It is our intention at preſent rather
                    to ſtate facts than to hazard any political opinion concerning the wiſdom or
                    folly of the tranſactions which we record. It may here, however, be remarked,
                    that no part of the proceedings of the French National Aſſembly was received by
                    perſons of rank upon the Continent of Europe with ſo much indignation as this.—
                    'I'he feudal ſyſtem had been overturned, and the property of the church wreſted
                    from it, with little comparative notice ; but when thoſe nominal diſtinctions
                    were attacked which antiquity had ſanctioned, and perſonal vanity rendered dear,
                    the ſurrounding nations were inſtantly alarmed, and beheld with terror the
                    levelling precedent, we may likewiſe add, that no part of their proceedings was
                    more inimical to rational and practical freedom. To preferve a perfect equality
                    of ranks is impoffible. In a commercial nation, induſtry will procure wealth,
                    and wealth will every where procure dependents. Now nothing more contributes to
                    keep within ſome tolerable bounds the inſolence of newly acquired wealth, than
                    the rank attached to birth and nobility, which time and prejudice have conſpired
                    to make reſpectable. It is not a little remarkable, that of all the King’s
                    miniſters, Neckar alone, a plebeian, a republican, born and bred in a democracy,
                    adviſed his Majeſty to refuſe his affent to this fooliih decree, as a violent
                    but uſeleſs encroachment upon the prejudices of a powerful order of the ſtate.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the capital was entirely engroſſed by hurry and buſtle. M.
                    Bailly had propoſed a plan for commemorating the anniverſary of the taking of
                    the Baſtile. It was adopted, becaufe it flattered the vanity of the people, by
                    preſenting them with a fplendid fpectacle in commemoration of their own
                    exertions. —The army had been much diſorganized ; and it was reſolved to attempt
                    to unite all its branches, as well as She whole departments of the ſtatc, ia onc
                    common at-</p>
                <p>tachment to the new order of things, by collecting into one place deputations,
                    for the purpoſe of ſwearing· fidelity to the new conſtſtution. In the middle of
                    the Champ de Mars an altar was erected, at which the civic oath, as it was
                    called, was to be taken. Around the akar an amphitheatre was thrown up capable
                    of containing 400,000 ſpectators; 2000 workmen were employed in this operation ;
                    and the people of Paris, fearing left die plan might not be completed, affiiſted
                    ia the labour. All ranks of perſons, the nobles, clergy, and even ladies, with
                    the eagerneſs for novelty ſo pe-culiar to that people, united their efforts.
                    Crowds of foreigners as well as natives hurried to the capital to be preſent at
                    this ſolemnſty, which was called the <hi rend="italic">Confederation.</hi> The
                    long-expected 14th of July at length arrived. At fix o’clock in the morning the
                    prυceffion was aπanged on the Boulevards, and conſiſted of the electors of the
                    city of Paris, the reprefentatives of the commons, the adminiſtrators of the
                    municipality, a bat-talion of children, with a ſtandard, infcribed " The hopes
                    -of the nation deputies from the troops of France wherever quartered, and of
                    every order, along with deputies from all the departments ; to theſe were added
                    immenfe detachments of the military, and of the na <hi rend="sup">t</hi> ional
                    guards, along with an almoſt infinite multitude oſ drums, trumpets, and muſical
                    inſtruments. The pro-ceffion was extremely fplendid, as every diſtrict had its
                    peculiar decorations. The national affembly paffed through a grand triumphal
                    arch, and the king and queen, attended by the foreign miniſters, were placed in
                    a ſuperb box. After a ſolemn invocation to God, the King approached the altar,
                    and, amidſt the deepeſt ſilence, took the following oath : " I the King of the
                    French do ſwear to the nation, that I will employ the whole power delegated to
                    me by the conſtitutional law of the ſtate, to maintain the conſtitution, and
                    enforce the execution of the law.” The preſident of the national affembly then
                    went up to the altar, and took the civic oath, “ I ſwear to be faithful to the
                    nation, the law, and the king ; and to maintain with all my powers the
                    conſtitution decreed by the national affembly, and accepted by the king.” Every
                    member of the affembly handing up, ſaid, “ That I fwear.” La Fayette then
                    advancing, took the oath for himfclf ; the other deputies of the national guards
                    pronouncing after him, " That I ſwear and theſe words were ſolemnly pronounced
                    byevery individual of this immenfe affembly. <hi rend="italic">Te Deum</hi> was then fung. The performance was ſublime beyond the powers of defcriptiυn.
                    Never perhaps be-fore was there hιch an orcheſtra, or ſuch an audience : their
                    numbers baffled the eye to reckon, and their ſhouts in full chorus rent the
                    ſkies. It is impoffible to enumerate ail the means which were employed to add
                    fpleh-dυr to this day. It ended with a general illumination, and no accident
                    diſturbed the public tranquillity.</p>
                <p>The aſſembly now proceeded in the formation of the conſtitution with
                    conſiderable tranquillity; which, however, was diſturbed by au unhappy event at
                    Nancy. Moil of the officers of the army were unfriendly to the late revolution,
                    and every means had been employed by them to difguſt the loldiers with it. At
                    Nancy., in particular, neceffaries had been &lt;lenied them, and their pay
                    was kept back, under pretence that this was the will of the national aſſembly.
                    Driven to deſpair, the regiments in garrifon threw off their allegiance, and de-</p>

                <p>manded loudly the regimental accounts. They ſeized at the fame time the military
                    cheſt, and ſent a deputa-tion to ſtate their caſe at Paris to the national
                    aſſembly. But the officers were before-hand, and prepoffeſſed the miniſter of
                    war againſt them ; upon whoſe repreſentation a decree was paſſed, authoriſing
                    the commander in chief of the province, M. Bouille, to reduce the inſurgents by
                    force. This was no ſooner known, than the national guard of Nancy affembled, and
                    ſent a deputation to give a fair ſtatement of facts. But Bouille, without
                    waiting the refult of an explanation, haſtened to Nancy at. the head of all the
                    troops he could ſudden-Iv collect ; and having fallen upon the regiments of
                    Chateauvieux and Meſtre de Camp, after putting an immenſe multitude to the
                    ſword, he took 4.00 priſoners.</p>
                <p>The King’s regiment was prevented from acting againſt Bouille by the intrepidity
                    of a young officer of tlie name <hi rend="italic">Deſſt/es,</hi> who, however,
                    died of the wounds w hich he received on the occaſion. Tile news of theſe events
                    filled Paris with indignation. The aſſembly afterwards reverſcd its own decrees
                    againſt the inſnrgents at Nancy. Public honours were decreed to the memory of
                    Deffillcs ; but Bouille could not be puniſhed, becauſe he had only acted in
                    obedience to authority.</p>
                <p>M. Neckar’s popularity had been gradually declining, as he was unwilling to go
                    all the lengths that the ruling party wiſhed. He gave in his reſignation on the
                    4th of September, and ſpeedily thereafter left the kingdom. He was regretted by
                    no party. He was regarded, on the one ſide, as having conducted the kingdom to
                    its ruin, by the conceffions which he originally adviſed the king to make in
                    favour of the <hi rend="italic">tiers etat ;</hi> while he was deſpiſed by the
                    oppoſite party as a lukewarm politician, of narrow views, and a feeble mind. He
                    departed, however, with thé unblemiſhed reputation of ſtrict integrity. M.
                    Neckar does not ſeem to have penetrated deeply into the characters of men, or to
                    have had any conception of the effects of that terrible and reſtleſs energy
                    which is called forth in a nation which attempts to make important changes in
                    its ancient manners and government. Having no conception of the important era
                    which was about to open upon that country of which he was the miniſter, lie was
                    ſar from being qualified to direct or controul it amidſt the convulſions which
                    it was deſtined to encounter. Unable to brook the loſs of his popularity, he
                    peeviſhly retired to Swiſſerland, where he publiſhed a work, which ſhows to the
                    conviction of every unprejudiced reader the integrity of the French king, and
                    the wicked projects of the leading democrates, whom he himſelf had armed with
                    power.</p>
                <p>The remaining part of tin’s year was occupied in attempts to introduce ſome
                    degree of ſubordination into the navy of France, which had been much
                    diſorganized, and in farther regulating the affairs of the clergy. It was now
                    declared, that ſuch clergymen as ſhould not take the foliowing oath, which had
                    been preſcribed ſome months before, ſhsuld be conſidered as ejected from their
                    benefices : " To watch carefully over the faithful in the pariſh or dioceſe
                    which was entruſted to Iſis care ; to be faithſul to the nation, the law, and
                    the king ; and to maintain to the utmoſt of his power the new conſtitution of
                    France, and particularly the decrees relative to the civil conſtitution oſ the
                    clergy.” This decree rendered the ſituation of conſcientious men etu tremely
                    perplexing ; eſpecialIy as the pope teſtiſied in marked terms his diſapprobation
                    of the oath. The people were reduced to the dilemma of dhooſing be-tween their
                    new political and their old religious preju-dſces, and the reſult was extremely
                    unfavourable to the intereſt of religion.</p>
                <p>The aſſembly commenced the new year with a decree, announcing the termination of
                    its ſeſſion, which was to take place as foon as it ſhould have finiſhed the
                    diſcuf· lion of a liſt of conſtitutioual articles. In the mean time, on the ſide
                    of Germany, Spain, Italy, and Savoy, hoſtile appearances began to be exhibited,
                    and bodies of troops advanced around the French frontier. The Emperor Leopold
                    was, however, too cautious to announce his intentions ; and the King foon
                    communica-ted a letter from him, containing proteſtations of amicable
                    diſpoſitions, but addin&lt;r, that " the innovations occaſioned by the
                    decrees of the 4th of Auguſt ought to bc done away.” The King treated this
                    merely a» an official meaſure on the part of the Emperor, that he might not
                    appear to renounce the claims of certain German princes connected with Lorraine
                    and Alſace. But the aſſembly expreſſed ſome alarm, and voted an augmentation of
                    the national force. About this period. ſeveral new efforts were made by the
                    diſaffected clergy in various parts of the kingdom to excite diſturbances, which
                    it is unneceſſary to mention in detail. On the 20th of February the public
                    attention was rouſed by a circumſtance that in any other ſtate of affairs would
                    have been accounted unimportant. The King announced to the aſſembly, that his
                    aunts, the daughters of Louis XV. had that morning left Paris ; but as hc did
                    not appre-hend that the exiſting laws laid them under any reſtraint in this
                    reſpect, he had not oppoſed their departure. Aſter ſome debate,, the aſſembly
                    agreed that the King had judged well ; and theſc princeſſes were left to purſue
                    their journey to Rome, which they reached after ſome delays occaſioned by the
                    jealouſy of certain municipalities through which they paſſed. Thus the-kingdom
                    was gradually deſerted by every branch of the royal family, excepting the King
                    and his eldeſt brother Monſieur. ſ he aſſembly, however, continued its Ia-bours
                    with conſiderable quietneſa. In the end' of the month of March died the
                    celebrated M. de Mirabeau, at the age of 42 years; a man whoſe integrity has for
                    many good reaſons been much ſuſpected, but whoſe political addreſs- and
                    intrepidity, and whoſe ſplendid powers of eloquence, have been ſeldom equalled.
                    He re-ceived from his countrymen at his death marks of re-</p>
                <p>ſpect unparalleled in modern hiſtory. During his ſhort illneſs, his door was
                    bcſieged by anxious citizens. A-mourning of eight days was dccreed by the
                    aſſembIy, and alſo a grand proceffion, which, was attendcd by all the public
                    functionaries. He was the firſt who"was· interred in the new magnificent
                    Pantheon, conſecrated to the reception of the remains of illuſtrious men. But
                    his aſhes were afterwards removed, in conſequence of very clear proofs that he
                    had not been incorruptible by money.</p>
                <p>During the whole of thisſpring, much fear was en-tertained that ſome attempts at
                    a counter revolution were about to be made. The emigrant army aſſembled on the
                    borders of Alſace was reviewed by the prince of Condé. Their uniform was· black,
                    faced with yellow,</p>

                <p>with a death’s head, ſurrounded by a laurel wreath on one cuff, and a ſword on
                    the other ; with the motto, " Conquer or die.” The king was alſo ſurrounded by
                    crowds of nonjuring prieſts and other diffaſſected perſons. Thus, that popular
                    jealouſy which in every pe-riod of the revolution has ſtrikingly marked the
                    French character, was kept on the alarm. On the 18th of A-pril, therefore, when
                    the royal Family was preparing to go to St Cloud to pafs ſome days, a report was
                    inſtant-ly ſpread that the king was about to fly from the country. The carriages
                    were immediately ſurrounded by •people. La Fayette drew out the national guard,
                    but they refuſed to act. " WC know (exclaimed they) that we are violating the
                    laws, but the ſafety of our country is the ſirſt law.” The King inſtantly went
                    to the affembly, and with much ſpirit complained of the inſult. He was anſwered
                    reſpectſully by the preſident, and continued bis journey. As the royal family
                    had enjoyed a conſiderable degree of freedom for ſome time paſt, which was
                    demonſtrated by the unſucceſsful oppo-ſition made to this journey—the preſent
                    opportunity was embraced for intimating to foreign courts his ac-ceptance of the
                    conſtitution ; and ali obnoxious perſons were difmiſſed from about his perſon.
                    The breach of diſeipline on the part of the national guard on this occaſion was
                    ſo much reſented by La Fayette, that he reſigned his command. Paris was thrown
                    into conſternation ; and it was not till after the moſt univerſal ſolicitation
                    that he was prevailed upon to refume his</p>
                <p>office.</p>
                <p>About this time M. de Bouille, to whom the protection of the frontiers was
                    entruſted, was employing, as it is now ſaid, every means in his power to render
                    the country defencelefs. The garriſons were left unprovided ; diffunion was
                    ſpread among the national troops; they were removed ſrom the frontiers, and
                    their place was occupied by foreigners, wherever it could be done. The emigrants
                    abroad, and their friends at home, were lying in wait for an opportunity of
                    revolt ;—when ſuddenly, on the 2 iſt of June, it was announced from the
                    Thuilleries, that the king, the queen, the dauphin, with monſieur and madame,
                    had quitted the palace and the capital, without leaving any information of thcir
                    inten-tion or their route. The emotion excited by this news among the multitude
                    was a mixture of conſternation and rage. The national affembly, however, acted
                    with much coolneſs. They inſtantly took upon themſelves the government, and
                    decreed their fittings permanent. They ſent meffengers, at the ſame time, in all
                    directions, to attempt to lay hold of the fugitives. Theſe had taken different
                    routs. Monſieur and madame arrived ſaſely at Bruſſels on the 23d. The king,
                    queen, and their children, when they came to a conſiderable diſtance from the
                    capital, were furniſhed by Bouille with a guard of dragoons, under pretencc of
                    protecting treaſure for the pay of the troops. At the diſtance of 156 miles, and
                    when only a few leagues from the frontiers, they were arreſted at St Menehould
                    by the poſtmaſter, M. Drouet, formerly a dragoon in the regiment of Condé. At
                    half paſt feven o’clock in the evening the carriages ſtopt to change horſes at
                    his houſe ; he thought he recollected the queen, and ima-gined that the king’s
                    face reſembled the impreffions ſtamped upon affignats. The eſeort of dragoons
                    in-creaſed the ſuſpicion. He ſuffered them to depait at</p>
                <p>U o'clock without notice; hut taking a çmnpmiitm with him, he went by a ſhorter
                    road to Varenneai with the affiſtance oſ the poſtmaſter there he gave the alarm,
                    and overturned a carriage on the bridge, which detained the royal travellers
                    till the national guard of the place had aſſembled, and the arreſt was effected
                    without bloodſhed. They were brought back to Pa-ris by a deputation from the
                    aſſembly. At his depar-ture, the king had imprudently left behind him a
                    me-morial, in which he declared, that he never had thought any ſacrifice too
                    great for the reſtoration of order ; but that the deſtruction of the kingdom,
                    and the triumph of anarchy, being the only reward of all his efforts, he thought
                    it neceſſary to depart from it. He then takes a review of the faults of the new
                    conſtitution, the grievances he has ſuffered ; and proteſts againſt every thing
                    that he had been compelled to do during his cap-tivity.</p>
                <p>Different parties were very differently affected by this ill-conducted and
                    unfortunate flight of the King. A ſmall republican party had already begun to
                    appear, and during the king’s abſence, attempts were made to induce the public
                    at large to conſider the royal au-thority as no neceffary part of a free
                    conſtitution. But the minds of men were by no means prepared for the re-ception
                    of this new doctrine. The idea, however, ha· ving been thus publicly propoſed,
                    left ſome impreffions, which in time contributed to give riſe to important
                    events. By ſar the greater number of leading men, however, were at preſent
                    convinced, that it was impoffible to conduct a great empire like France, well
                    and pro-ſperouſly, without the aſſiſtance of an hereditary chief. They therefore
                    determined to paſs over the affair with as much ſilence as poffible, and to
                    haften the period when their new conſtitution ſhould be complete. But there is
                    reaſon to believe, that this journey was at the long-run highly inſtrumental in
                    producing very fatal effects to tbe perfonal ſafety oſ the monarch.</p>
                <p>His flight ſeemed a ſignal for emigration. Many of the ariſtocratic party ſent
                    in reſignations of their feats in the national aſſembly. Troops were levied on
                    the frontiers in the King’s name ; who took care, however, to diſavow any
                    connection with ſuch a procedure. Bouille emigrated, and afterwards ſent to the
                    aſſembly a furious threatening letter : " You ſhall anſwer (fays he) ſor the
                    lives of the king and of the queen to all the monarchs of the univerſe. Touch
                    but a ſingle hair of their heads, and not one ſtone ſhall be left upon ano-ther
                    in Paris. I know the roads. I will conduct the foreign armies. This letter is
                    but the forerunner of the manifeſto of the ſovereigns of Europe.”</p>
                <p>A conſiderable calm throughout France followed theſe events, and it might be
                    regarded as in a ſtate of tranquillity. It contained, indeed, parties
                    entertaining much animoſity againſt each other, and many citizens had withdrawn
                    to foreign countries ; but the peace was not broken, and moderate men hoped that
                    much proſperity would follow from the late agitations. But this calm was
                    deluſive ; and in the midſt of it thoſe projects were formed which were
                    afterwards to prove ſo fatal to the peace of France and of Europe. Towards the
                    cloſe of this ſummer, a convention took place at Pilnitz in Saxony between the
                    emperor Leopold and the king of Pruffia. Its object was not known at the time,
                    but it gradually came into view, and is now by many under-</p>

                    invade them. But in ſtating the events of this revolution, it is perhaps ſtill

                <p>In the mean time, the national aſſembly was haſſen-ing faſt to the completion of
                    the new conſtitution. It was ſiniſhed on the 3d of September, and prefented to
                    the king. It begins with the following declaration of the rights of a man and a
                    citizen, and thereafter foliow the different branches; the chief of which are
                    here translated.</p>
                <p>I. All men are born, and remain, free and equal in rights : ſocial diſtinctions
                    cannot be founded but on common utility.</p>
                <p>II. The end of all political aſſociations is the pre-ſervation of the natural
                    and impreſcriptihle rights of man : theſc rights are liberty, property,
                    ſecurity, and reſiſtance againſt oppreſſion.</p>
                <p>III. The principle of <hi rend="italic">ſovereignty</hi> reſides eſſentially
                    in the nation : <hi rend="italic">no body of men,</hi> no <hi rend="italic">individual,</hi> can exer* ciſe an authority that does not emanate
                    expreſsly from that fource.</p>
                <p>IV. <hi rend="italic">Liberty</hi> conſiſts in the power of doing every thing
                    except that which is hurtful to another : hence the exercife of the natural
                    rights of every man has no other bounds than thoſc that are neceſſary to enſure
                    to the other members of ſociety the enjoyment of the ſame rights : thoſe bounds
                    can be determined by the law only.</p>
                <p>V. The law has a right to forbid thoſc actions alone that are hurtful to
                    ſociety. whatever is not forbid-den by the law, cannot be hindered ; and no
                    perſon can be conſtrained to do that which the law ordaineth not.</p>
                <p>VI. The law is the expreffion of the general will : all the citizens have a
                    right to concur perſonally, or by their repreſentatives, to the formation oſ the
                    law : it ought to be the ſame for all, whether it protect, or whether it puniſh.
                    All citizens being equal in the eye of the law, are equally admiffible to
                    dignities, places, and public offices, according to their capacity, and without
                    any other diſtinction but that of their virtue and their talents.</p>
                <p>VII. No man can be accuſcd, arreſted, or detained, except in cafes determined by
                    the law, and according to the forms which the law hath preſcribed. Thoſc who
                    folicit, diſpatch, execute, or cauſe to be executed, arbitrary orders, ought to
                    be pnniſhed ; but every citi-zen that is ſummoned or ſeized in virtue of the
                    law, ought to obey inſtantly—he becomes culpable by reſiſtance.</p>
                <p>VIII. The law ought to eſtabliſh ſuch puniſhments only as are ſtrictly and
                    evidently neceſſary ; and no perſon can be puniſhed but in virtue of a law
                    eſta-bliſhed and promulgated prior to the offence, and le-gally applied.</p>
                <p>IN. Evcry man being preſumed innocent till ſuch</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0170" facs="gri_33125011196389_0176.tif"/>
                <p>time as he has becn declared guilty, if it ſhall be deem-ed abfolutely neceffary
                    to arreſt a man, every kind of rigour employed, not neceſſary to ſecure his
                    perſon, ought to be ſeverely repreffed by the law.</p>
                <p>X. No perfon ſhall be moleſted for his opinions, even ſuch as are religious,
                    provided tliat tlie manifeſtation of thoſe opinions does not diſturb tlie public
                    order eſta-bliſhed by the law.</p>
                <p>XI. The free communication of thought, and of opinion, is one of the moſt
                    precious rights oſ man. Every citizen, therefore, may freely ſpeak, write, and
                    publiſh, his ſentiments ; ſubject, however, to anſwer for the abuſe of that
                    liberty, in cafes determined by the law.</p>
                <p>XII. The guarantee of the Rights of Man and Ci-tizens, involves a neceffity of <hi rend="italic">public force :</hi> this force is then inſtituted for
                    the advantage of all, and not for the particular utility of tliofe to whom it is
                    confided.</p>
                <p>XIII. For the maintenance of public force, and for tlie expences of
                    adminiſtration, a common contribution is indiſpenſably neceſſary : this
                    contribution ſhould be equally divided amongſt all the citizens, in proportion
                    to their abilities.</p>
                <p>XIV. Every citizen lias a right, by himſelf, or by his repreſentatives, to
                    decide concerning the neceffity of the public contribution ; to conſent to it
                    freely ; to look after the employment of it ; to determine the quantity, the
                    diſtribution, the collection, and duration.</p>
                <p>XV. Tlie ſociety has a right to demand from every public agent an account of his
                    adminiſtration.</p>
                <p>XVI. Every ſociety, in which the guarantee of rights is not affured, nor the

                <p>The French colonies and poffeffions in Alia, Africa, and America, " though they

                    legiſſative power.</p>
                <p>On the 13th of September the King announced, by a letter to the Preſident of the
                    Affembly, his accept-ance of the conftitution. This event was ordered to be
                    notified to all the foreign courts, and the Affembly decreed a general amneſty
                    with reſpect to the events of the revolution. On the following day the King
                    repaired fin perſon to rhe National Aſſembly; and being conducted to a chair of
                    ſtate prepared for him at the ſide oſ the Preſident, he ſigned the
                    conſtitutional act, and took an oath of fidelity to it. He then withdrew, and
                    was attended back to the Thuilleries by the whole Affembly, with the Preſident
                    at their head. On the 30th of September, tliis National Affembly, which has
                    ſince been known by the name of the <hi rend="italic">ConfUtuent AJfem-bly,</hi> diſſolved itſelf, and gave place to the ſucceeding <hi rend="italic">Leſtſtative National Affembly,</hi> which had been elected according to the
                    rules preſcribed by the new conſtitu-tion.</p>
                <p>On the character and the labours of the <hi rend="italic">Conſtituent Affembly,</hi> we ſhall only remark, that it contained many men of talents, and, in all
                    probability, a conſiderable number of men of integrity. Towards the clofe of its
                    ſeffion, it affumed a very ſtriking character of modera-tion, and appears to
                    have been completely monarchical, although its jealouſy oſ tlie ancient
                    ariſtocracy pre-vented it from ſufficiently guarding the throne againſt popular
                    violence ; for a very ſtriking defect in the new couſtitution ſoon appeared. The
                    King poſſeffed a <hi rend="italic">veto,</hi> or negative, upon the
                    reſolutions of the legiſiative body: but this negative he was bound to exerciſe
                    in <hi rend="italic">perfon,</hi> without reſponſibility, and without the
                    intervention of his miniſters. He had no ſenate, or upper chamber, to ſtand
                    between him and popular violence ; and there was ſomething apparently abſurd in
                    ſettling the vote of an individual, »1 oppoſition to the collective wifdom and
                    will of a whole nation·. In conſequence of this, he was reduced to the hard
                    alternative of yielding to every vote of the National Affembly, or of expoſing
                    himſelf perſonally to public odium.</p>
                <p>The new Aſſembly was opened by the King on the</p>
                <p>7th of October, with much apparent union op. all ſides. His ſpeech, recommending
                    unanimity aud conſidence between the legiſſative and executive powers, was
                    received with unbounded applauſe. The character of the men who compoſed the new
                    National Affembly was unauſpicions to the Court. At the commencement of the
                    revolution, the great body of the people at a diſtance from the capital were
                    little intereſted in thoſe projects of freedom which occupied the more
                    enlightened or more turbulent inhabitants of Paris. They had gra-dually,
                    however, been roufed from their lethargy. The variety of powers conferred by the
                    new conſtitution upon the people at large, and the multiplicity of offices of
                    which it gave them the patronage, had kindled in the minds of men a love of
                    dominion, and a wiſh to inter-fere in public affairs. This attached them to the
                    new order of things. The love of power, which is the leaſt difguiſed paffion in
                    the human heart, and equally ſtrong in the breaſt of the meaneſt and of the
                    higheſt of mankind, was thus, under the name of liberty, become a leading
                    paffion throughout this wide empire. They who flattered it moſt, and were moſt
                    loud in praiſe of the rights of the people, became ſpeedily the favourites of
                    the public. The conſequence of this was, that the new National Aſſembly was
                    chiefly compoſed oſ conn-try gentlemen, of principles highly democratic, or oſ
                    men of letters who had publiſhed popular books, or conducted periodical
                    publications. The members of the Conſtituent Affembly had been excluded by their
                    own decree from holding feats in the new legiſlature.—-The members of the
                    latter, theiefore, had little regard, for a conſtitution which they themſelves
                    had not framed, and whieh was not protected by the venerable ſanction of
                    antiquity.</p>
                <p>when this Aſſembly ſirſt met, it ſhowed a very triſſmg attentlon to formalitles,
                    and a peevlſh jealouſy of the miniſters of the crown. In the mean time, the
                    treaty of Pilnitz, already mentioned, began to be rumoured abroad, and France
                    was thrown into a ſtate of anxious jealoufy for the ſaſety of its newly-acquired
                    liberties. Although the Pruffians and Germans (the Elector of Mentz alone
                    excepted) all continued to temporize, the northern powers, Sweden and Ruffia,
                    entered into ſtrict engagements to reſtore the old def-potiſm of France. On the
                    9th of November, a decree was paffed, that the emigrants who, after the ſirſt of
                    January next, ſhould be found affembled, as at preſent, in a hoſtile manner,
                    beyond the frontiers, ſhould be conſidered as guilty of a conſpiracy, and ſuffer
                    death ; that the French Princes, and public functionaries, wlio ſhould not
                    return before that period, ſhould be puniſh-able in the fame manner, and their
                    property forfeited during their own lives. On the 18th, a ſeriesof ſevere
                    decrees was alſo paffed againſt ſucli of the ejected clergy as ſtill refuſed to
                    take the civic oath. To both-theſe decrees the King oppoſed his <hi
                        rend="italic"> veto,</hi> or negative.— The moderate party,, who were
                    attached to the conſti-tution, rejoiced at this as a proof of the freedom of
                    their ſovereign. But, on the other ſide, it excited a moſt violent clamour, and
                    became the means of exciting new ſufpſcion of the wiſhes of the Court. At this
                    time. anſwers were received from the different foreign Courts to the
                    notification ſent them of the King’s acceptance of the new conſtitution. Theſe
                    were generally conceived in a ſtile of caution, and avoided giving</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0174" facs="gri_33125011196389_0180.tif"/>
                <p>open offence. The Emperor even prohibited all affem-blages of emigrants within
                    his ſtates ; and the King intimated to the Aſſembly that he had declared to the
                    Elector of Treves, that unleſs the emigrants ſhould ceaſe before tbe 15th of
                    January to make hoſtile preparations within his territories, he would be
                    conſidered as the enemy of France. All this, however, did not preſerve the court
                    from ſuſpicion ; for although the diffe-rent foreign courts had openly declared
                    pacific inten-tions, yet the French emigrants boldly aſſerted, that all Europe
                    was actually arming in their favour. Accordingly they ceaſed not to ſolicit
                    their equals in rank, wlio ſtill remained within tlie country, to leave it to
                    îoin witli tliem in what tliey called the <hi rend="italic">royal cauſe.—</hi> The unhappy Louis, placed between a republican party that was gradually
                    gathering ſtrengtli, and an ariſtocratical party that was rouſing Europe to arms
                    againſt a nation of wliich he was the conſtitutional chief, and a combination of
                    Princes juſtly ſuſpected of wiſhing to ſeize upon a part of his dominions, ſtood
                    in .a ſituation which would have perplexed tlie moſt ſkilful ſtateſman ; and it
                    is no proof of incapacity that he ſell a ſacrifice to circumſtances which miglit
                    have overwhelmed any known meaſure of human ingenuity. Addreffes were crowding
                    into the Aſſembly, diſapproving the conduct of the court. M. Montmorin reſigned
                    ; M. Deleſſart ſucceeded him ; and M. Caluer de Ger-villc became miniſter of the
                    interior. M. du Portail reſigned alfo, and M. Narbonne ſucceeded him as
                    ml-niſter of war. In the month of November, M. Bailly’s mayoralty terminated ;
                    and the once popular La Fayette appeared as a candidate to ſucceed him. But he
                    was ſucceſsfully oppoſed by M. Petion, a violent Jacobin, and a declared
                    republican, who was elected mayor of Paris by a great majority.</p>
                <p>At this period the moderate men, who were friends of the conſtitution, attempted
                    to counteract the influence of the Jacobin club by the eſtabliſhment of a
                    ſi-milar one. It derived its name from the vacant convent of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> Feudlans,</hi> 111 whlch lt affembled. ſt he moſt active
                    members of the Conſtituent Affembly belonged to it, ſuch as Μ. M. D’ Andre,
                    Barnave, the Lametbs, Du Port, Rabaud, Sieyes, Chapelier, Thouret, La-bord,
                    Taleyrand, Montefquieu, Beaumetz, &amp;c. The Jacobins contrived to excite a
                    riot at the place of their meeting, which was in the vicinity of the hall of the
                    National Aſſembly. This afforded a pretext for ap-plying to the Affembly for tbe
                    removal of the new clilb. The A ſſembly ſhowed their diſpoſition, by complying
                    with this requeftt</p>
                <p>At the end of this year, the kingdom of France was by no means proſperous. The
                    public revenue had fallen far ſhort of the expenditure. The emigrant no-bility
                    had carried out of the kingdom tbe greater part of the current coin, and a
                    variety of manufacturers, who depended upon their oftentatious luxury, were
                    re-duced to much diſtrefs. The diſpoſitions of foreign courts appeared very
                    doubtful. The new year, how-ever, opened with deluſive proſpects of
                    tranquillity.— The German Princes appeared ſatisfied with the mode of
                    compenfation whieh the French had offered for the loſs of their poffeffions in
                    Alſace and Lorraine. The Prince of Loweſtein accepted of an indemnification.—
                    The Princes of Hohenlohe and Salm-Salm declared themſelves ready to treat upon
                    the ſame terms. Prince</p>
                <p>Maximilian, and tlie Dukes of wirtemberg and Deux-Ponts, freely ncgociated. It
                    is unneceffary to ftate in detail the ſubterfuges employed, in the mean time, by
                    the crafty Leopold, for amuſing the French with the appearances of peace. M.
                    Deleſſart, miniſter for fo-reign affairs, fell a ſacriſice to them, and probably
                    to the undecided character of Louis. He was accufed by M. Briffot of not having
                    given timely notice to the National Aſſembly of the diſpoſitions of foreign
                    powers, and of not preffing proper meaſures for ſecuring the ho-nour and ſafety
                    of the nation. A decree of accuſation paffed againſt him in his ab fence. He was
                    apprehend-ed, tried by the high national court at Orleans, and executed in
                    conſequence of its ſentence. '</p>
                <p>The ſudden death of Leopold on the ſirſt of March gave riſe to a tranſient hope
                    that peace might ſtill be preſerved. A ſuſpicion of poiſon ſell upon the French,
                    but it was removed by the detail of his diſeaſe that was ſpeedily piibliſhed. On
                    the 16th of the fame month, the King of Sweden was wounded by a nobleman of the
                    name of Ankerſtrom, ftnd died on the 29th. This enterpriſing Prince had
                    overturned the conſtitution of his own conntry, and he had formed the project of
                    con-ducting in perſon his troops to the frontiers of France, and of commanding
                    or accompanying the combined ar-mies of Europe in their attempt to avenge the
                    cauſe of inſulted royalty. It was in a great meaſure to counter-act this ſeheme
                    that he was aſſaffinated.</p>
                <p>The ſudden fall, however, of thefe two enemies rather accelerated than retarded
                    the meditated hoſtilities. The young King of Hungary, who ſucceeded to the
                    empire, made no ſecret either of his own intentions or of the exiſtence of a <hi
                        rend="italic"> concert of Princes</hi> againſt France. M. Dumourier was now
                    at the head of the war-office, M. Rolland was miniſter of the interior, and M.
                    Cla-viere miniſter of finance. The Jacobins were all-powerful. The Court gave
                    way to the torrent. The property of the emigrants was conſiſeated, reſerving the
                    rights of creditors. The Imperial miniſter, Prince Kaunitz, demanded three
                    things of France; <hi rend="italic">lſt,</hi> Tile reſtitution of their feudal
                    rights to the German Princes; <hi rend="italic">zdly,</hi> To reſtore Avignon
                    to the Pope, the inhabitants of which had fome time before thrown off their
                    allegiance, and prevailed with the Conſtituent Affembly to receive their country
                    as a part of France ; and <hi rend="italic">laſtly,</hi> Prince Kaunitz
                    demanded, that " the neighbouring powers ſhould have no reaſon for apprehenſion
                    from the preſent weakneſs of the internal government of France.” On receiving
                    thefe demands, the king propoſed a decla-ration of war, which was decreed by the
                    National Aſe ſembly on the 20th of April, againſt <hi rend="italic">the King oſ
                        Hungary and Bohemia.</hi></p>
                <p>The French immediately began the war, by attack-ing in three different columns
                    the Auſtrian Netherlands. M. Theobald Dillon advanced from Liile to Tournay,
                    where he found a ſtrong body of Auſtrians ready to receive him. The national
                    troops, unaccuſtomed to ſuſtain the ſire of regular ſoldiers, were inſtantly
                    thrown into confuſion, and fled even to the gates of Liſie. The cry of <hi
                        rend="italic"> treaſon</hi> refounded on all ſides; and their com. mander,
                    an experienced and faithful officer, was murdered by bis own ſoldiers and the
                    mob. A ſecond diviſion of 10,000 men, under Lieutenant-General Birofi, took
                    poffeffion of Quiverain on the 29th, and marched towards Mons, General Biron was
                    here attacked hy</p>

                <p>the Auſtrſans, whom he repulſed. <hi rend="sup">1</hi> Hearing, however, of
                    tile defeat of Dillon, he retreated. A third parry advanced to Furnes, but
                    afterwards withdrew. La Fayette at the fame time advanced towards Bouvines, half
                    way to Namur, from which he afterwards retreated. The whole of theſe expeditions
                    were ill contrived, in as much as they divided the French undiſciplined troops,
                    and expoſed them in ſmall bodies to the attack of veteran forces. The Auſtrians
                    were ſome time before they attempted to retaliate. At length, however, on the
                    iith of June, they attacked M. Gouvion, who commanded the advanced guard of La
                    Fayette’s army near Maubeuge. M. Gouvion was killed by a rolling bullet ; but La
                    Fayette himſelf having come up, the Auſtrians abandoned the field. In the mean
                    time, matters were haſtening in Paris towards a violent criſis. Two parties,
                    both of which were hoſtile to the preſent conſtitution, had gradually been
                    formed in the ſtate. The one wiſhed to give more effectual fupport to the royal
                    authority, by eſtabliſhing a <hi rend="italic">finale</hi> or <hi
                        rend="italic"> two chambers,</hi> to prevent the king’s vote from being the
                    ſole check upon popular enthuſiaſm. The other party wiſh-ed to ſet aſide royalty
                    altogether, and to hazard the bold experiment of converting France into a
                    republic. Theſe laſt were ſupported by the Jacobin club, which had now contrived
                    to concentrate in itſelf an immenſe maſs of influence. Innumerable popular
                    ſocieties were eſtabliſhed in every town and village throughout the provinces,
                    with theſe a regular correſpondence was kept up by writing and by emiſſaries.
                    Thus ſchemes and notions were inſtantaneouſly propagated through a great empire,
                    and all the violent ſpirits which it con-tained were enabled to act in concert :
                    Eut the more immediate engine of the republican party conſiſted of the immenſe
                    population of the metropolis, whom they now endeavoured to keep in conſtant
                    alarm. For this pnrpoſe they alleged, that an <hi rend="italic">Auſtrian
                        Committee,</hi> that is to fay, a confpiracy in favour of the enemies of
                    the coun-try, exiſted among the friends of the court. Μ. M. Genfonné and Briſſot
                    even offered in the aſſembly to prove the exiſtence of this pretended Auſtrian
                    committee. À report was next circulated, that the king intended to abſeond from
                    the capital on the 23d of May. Fiis majeſty publicly contradicted theſe
                    accuſa-tions as calumnies, but they made no ſmall impreffion upon the minds of
                    the public. New decrees were now made againſt the refractory clergy, but theſe
                    his majeſty reſuſed to ſanction. A propoſal was alſo made and decreed in the
                    aſſembly to form a camp of 20,000. men under the walls of Paris, and that for
                    this levy every canton in the kingdom ſhould contribute one horſeman and four
                    infantry. The national guard of Paiis diſ-liked the propoſal, and the king gave
                    to it his negative. Indeed at this time the king ſeems to have come to a
                    reſolution oſ ſtanding out againſt the Jacobin party, to which he had ſor ſome
                    time yieldedt The miniſtry were therefore diſmiſſed, excepting M. Dumourier, and
                    others were appointed in their ſtead. By this event Dumourier loſt die
                    confidence of the Jacobin club. Hé ſaw his error, reſigned his office, and
                    joined the army! In the mean time a decree had been paſſed, authoriſing tb.e
                    manufactory of pikes for the purpoſe of arming cheaply the lower claſs of
                    citizens. Ail means were uſcd to render^the king odious by inflammatory .wri-</p>
                <p>tings and harangues ; and in both of theſe the noted incendiary Marat took the
                    lead.</p>
                <p>On the 20th of June M. Roederer, the Procureur Ge- _ neral Syndic informed the
                    national aſſembly, that, con-trary to law, formidable bodies of armed men were
                    preparing to preſent petitions to the king, and to the national aſſembly. A part
                    of them ſpeedily appeared with St Huruge and Santerre a brewer at their head.
                    They marched through the hall in a proceffion that laſted two hours, at four
                    o’clock in the afternoon, to the number of about 40,000. They ſurrounded the
                    Thuilleries. The gates were thrown open; and on an attempt to break the door of
                    the apartment, where the king then was, he ordered them to be admitted. His
                    filler the princefs Elizabeth never departed from his ſide during four or ſive
                    hours that he was ſurrounded by the multitude, and compelled to liſten to every
                    ini dignity. Ali this while Petion, the mayor of Paris, was unaccountably
                    abſent. He at length, however, arrived, and alſo a deputation from the aſſembly.
                    The queen, with her children and the princeſs de Lamballe, were in the mean time
                    in the council-chamber, where, though protected from violence, they were yet
                    expoſed to much infult. At laſt, in conſequence of the approach of evening, and
                    of the entreaties of Petion, the multitude gradually diſperſed.</p>
                <p>The indignities ſuſſered on this day by the royal ſa-mily were in ſome reſpects
                    not unfavourable to their cauſe. A great number of the moſt reſpectable
                    inhabitants of the capital were aſhamed of fuch proceedings. They complained of
                    them ſeverely in a petition to the aſſembly, and addreſſes to the ſame purpoſe
                    were re-ceived from ſeveral departments. The directory of the department of
                    Paris, at the head of which were M;. Rochefaucault and M. Tulleyrand, publiſhed
                    a declaration diſapproving· of the conduct of the mayor, and of M. Manuel the
                    procureur of the commune, whom they. afterwards ſuſpended from their offices,
                    although they were ſpeedily reſtored by a decree of the aſſembly. At the ſame
                    time, La Fayette leaving his army fuddenly, appeared on the 26th at the bar of
                    the national aſſembly. Iffe declared that he came to exprefs the indignation
                    which the whole army felt on account of the events of the 20th : he called upon
                    the aſſembly to pu-niſh the promoters of theſe events, and to diſſolve the
                    factious clubs. The ſudden appearance of La Fayette threw the Jacobins into
                    conſternation, and from that period they never ceaſed to calumniate him.</p>
                <p>On the iſt of July, on the motion of M. Jean de Brie, tlie aſſembly ordered'a
                    proclamation to be made, that <hi rend="italic">the country was in danger.</hi> On the 6th, the king gave intimation that the king of Pruffia was marching
                    with 52,000 men to co-operate againſt France. The French arms were at this time
                    fomewhat ſuccefsful in the Auſtrian Netherlands ; but the cabinet ſpeedily
                    thought it neceſſary to order the armies to retreat : a meaſure which was.
                    afterwards ■ publicly cenfured by Marſhall Luckner.</p>
                <p>On the 7th, a lingular, ſcene occurred in the nation-al aſſembly. At the inſtant
                    that M. Briſſot was about to commence an oration, M. Lammourette biſhop of Lyons
                    requeſted to be heard for a few minutes. He expatiated on the neceffity of union
                    among the members of the affembly, anchoſ ſacriſicing their paffions and pre-</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0176" facs="gri_33125011196389_0182.tif"/>
                <p>judices on the altar of their country. He concluded an animated addrefs with
                    theſe words, “ Let all who hold in equal deteſtation a republic and two
                    chambers, and who wiſh to maintain the conſtitution as it is, rife!” The words
                    were ſcarcely pronounced when the whole aſſembly ſtarted from their feats. Men
                    of all parties ſolemnly embraced each other, and proteſted their adherence to
                    the conſtitution. A deputation announced this happy event to the king ; who
                    immediately came and congratulated them in a ſhort ſpeech, which was leceived
                    with infinite app’auſe. The only good effect, however, produced by this
                    temporary agreement was, that the ſeſtival of the 14th of July, which was
                    celebrated with the ufual magnificence, paſſed over in tranquillity.</p>
                <p>On the 25th of July, the duke of Brunfwick iſſued at Coblentz his celebrated
                    manifeſto. It declared the purpoſe of the intended invaſion of France to be the
                    reſtoration of the French king to full authority. It de-clared the national
                    guard of France reſponfible for the preſervation of tranquillity; and threatened
                    with the pu-niſhment of death, as rebels to their king, thoſe who ſhould appear
                    in arms againſt the allied powers. All men holding offices, civil or military,
                    were threatened in the ſame manner, as well as the inhabitants of all cities.
                    The city of Paris in particular, and the national aſſembly, were declared
                    reſponſible for every inſult which might be offered to the royal family. It was
                    declared, that if they were not immediately placed in ſafety, the allies were
                    reſolved to inflict " on thoſe who ſhould deſerve it the moſt exemplary and ever
                    memorable avenging puniſhments, by giving up the city of Paris to military
                    execution, and expoſing it to total deſtruction ; and the rebels who ſhould be
                    guilty of illegal reſlſtance ſhould ſuffer the puniſhments which they ſhould
                    have deſerved.” This ſanguinary and imprudent manifeſto operated as a warrant
                    for the deſtruction of the unfortunate Louis XVI. It left no middle party in the
                    na-tion. All who wiſhed to preferve freedom in any form, and all who loved the
                    independence of their country, were inſtantly united. At the ſame time, the
                    reproach-es caſt on the king by the Jacobins now gained univer-ſal credit. The
                    kings of Pruffia and of Hungary told the French nation, that their monarch was
                    ſecretly hof-tile to the conſtitution ; and the reſtoration of him and his
                    family to deſpotic power was made the ſole pre-tence for a bloody and dangerous
                    war.</p>
                <p>The republican party faw the advantage which they had now gained, and refolved
                    upon the depoſition of the king. The chief engine which they meant to employ in
                    this ſervice conſiſted of about 1500 men, who had come to Paris at the period of
                    the confederation on the 14th of July, and therefore called <hi rend="italic">faderes,</hi> and who were alfo fometimes denominated <hi rend="italic">Marfiillms,</hi> from the place from which the greater number of them came.
                    Next to theſe, dependence was placed in the populace of the ſuburbs of the
                    capital. the deſigns of the republicans were not unknown to the court, and both
                    parties were forming plans of operation. It is ſaid that the royal party
                    intended that the king and his family ſhould fuddenly lea^e the capital, and
                    proceed to as great a diſtance as the conſtitution permitted. The republicans
                    are ſaid to have intended to ſeize the perfon of the king, and to confine him in
                    the caſtle of Vin-cennes till a national convention ſhould decide upon his fate.
                    Both allegations are probably true. Every motive which can influence the mind of
                    man muſt have induced Louis to wiſh to be at a diſtance from the factious and
                    ſanguinary capital. And the ſubſequent conduct of the republicans authoriſe us
                    to believe them capable of the worſt crime that was laid to their charge.</p>
                <p>Various charges had been brought forward in the affembly againſt La Fayette, and
                    the 8th of Auguſt was appointed for their ducuffion. In the mean time, on the 3d
                    of Auguſt, Petion the mayor, at the head of a deputation from the ſections of
                    Paris, appeared at the bar, and in a ſolemn ſpeech demanded the depoſition of
                    the king. The diſcuſlion of the accuſation againſt La Fayette was conſidered as
                    a trial of ſtrength between the parties : he was acquitted, however, by a
                    majority of nearly 200 ; and the republican party, deſpairing oſ carrying their
                    point by a vote of the national aſſembly, •reſolved to have recourſe to
                    infurrection and force.</p>
                <p>On the evening of the 9th of Auguſt, about 1500 gentlemen, officers of the army,
                    and others, repaired to the palace, reſolved to protect the royal family or to
                    die in their defence : added to thefe were 70o Swifs guards, with a body of
                    cavalry amounting to about I ooo. Mandat, the commander of the national guards,
                    a man who was firmly attached to the conſtitution, had procured 2400 of that
                    body and 12 pieces of cannon, with ſuch a force, it has been generally thought
                    that, by vigorous and ſteady councils, the palace, which is a kind of caſtle,
                    might have been ſucceſsfully defended ; and what is now called a revolution
                    might have born the name of a rebellion. Meanwhile the aſſembly de-clared its
                    fittings permanent. Petion was at the palace late on the evening of the 9th.
                    Some apprehenſions were entertained, or pretended tobe entertained, forhia
                    ſafety (for the whole of this buſineſs was, on the part of the republicans, the
                    moſt infernal plot), and a deputation from the aſſembly brought him away. At
                    mid-night the toçlin or alarm bell was founded, and the drums beat to arms
                    through the city. At this inſtant a number of the moſt active leaders of the
                    republican party aſſembled, and elected a new common council or <hi
                        rend="italic"> commune.</hi> The perſons thus irregularly choſen inſſantly
                    took poſſeffion of the common hall, and drove out tlie lawful members ; who,
                    with that weakneſs with wliich men are apt to ſhrink from ſtations of
                    reſponſibility in pe-rilous times, readily gave place to tlie uſurpers. The new
                    commune ſent repeated meſſages to M. Mandat, requiring liis attendance upon
                    important buſineſs. He was occupied in arranging the troops in the beft order
                    a-round tlie palace ; but ſuſpecting nothing, he went to the common Lall, and
                    was there aſtoniſhed to ſind a different affembly from what he expected. He was
                    a-bruptly accuſed of a plot to maffacre the people, and ordered to priſon ; but
                    as he deſeended tbe ſtairs, lie was ſhot with a piſtol, and Santerre was
                    appointed in his ſtead to command the national guard.</p>
                <p>On this eventful night no perfon in the palace went to bed. About ſix o’clock in
                    the morning of the 10th the king deſeended into the gardens to review tlie
                    troops. He was received with ſhouts of <hi rend="italic">Vive le roi</hi> excepting from the artillery, who ſhouted <hi rend="italic">Vive la nation.</hi> The king returned to the palace, and the multitude continued to collect.
                    The national guard ſeemed undetermined about what they were to do, as they
                    aſſembled in diviſions near the palace ; and had a ſteady re-</p>

                <p>fiſtaflfce been made from within, it is probable they would have joined the
                    royal party. But towards eight o’clock M. Roederer procured admittance to the
                    palace, and told the king that armed multitudes were aſſembling in hoſtile array
                    around the Thuilleries ; that the national, guard was not to be depended upon ;
                    and that, in caſe of reſiſtance, the whole royal family would moſt certainly be
                    maſſacred. He therefore adviſed the king to ſeek protection in the hall of the
                    national affembly. with this advice the king, with his uſual facility of temper,
                    was ready to comply ; but the queen oppoſed with vehemence the humiliating
                    propoſal. Becoming gradually, however, alarmed for the ſaſety of her children,
                    ſhe gave her conſent 5 and the king and queen, the princeſs Elizabeth, with tlie
                    prince and princeſs royal, went on foot to the hall of the affembly. " 1 am come
                    hither (ſaid his majeſty) to prevent a great crime. Among you, gentlemen, I
                    believe myſelf in ſafety.” By an article of the conſtitution the aſſein-bly
                    could not deliberate in preſence of the king. The royal family were, therefore,
                    placed in a narrow box fe-parated from tb.e hall by a railing, where they
                    remained ſor 14 hours without any place to which they could retire for
                    refreſhment, excepting a very ſinall cloſet adjoining. Here they ſat liſtening
                    to debates, in which the royal character and office were treated with every mark
                    of inſult.</p>
                <p>when the king left the palace of the Tliuilleiies, he unfortunately forgot to
                    order it to be immediately ſurrendered. He recollected this as ſoon as he
                    reached the aſſembly, and ſent orders for this purpoſe ; but it was now too
                    late, 'ſ'he inſurgents amounted to about 20,000 effective men. They were drawn
                    up in tolerable order by weſterman a Pruffian, and had about 30 pieces of cannon
                    along with them. The gentlemen within the palace, who had aſſembled to protect
                    the king’s perſon, were now diſpirited, and knew not what part to act. The
                    commander of the Swifs, M. Aſſry, was abſent, and the captains knew not what to
                    do; and the national guard had no leader in conſequence of the death of Mandat.
                    About nine o’clock the outer gates were forced open ; and the inſurgents formed
                    their line in front of the palace. A bloody combat commenced chiefly between the
                    Marſeillois and the Swiſs. After a brave reſlſtance of about an hour, the Swiſs
                    were overpowered by numbers, and gave way. All of them that could be ſound in
                    tlie palace were maſſacred ; fome •even while imploring quarter on their knees.
                    Others eſeaped into the city, and were protected by individuals. Of this brave
                    regiment, however, only 200 furvi-ved ; but every human being, even the loweſt
                    ſervants found in the palace, were put to death. The Swiſa taken prifonere in
                    various quarters were conducted to the door oſ the aſſembly, and taken by a
                    decree under the protection of the ſtate. But the ſanguinary multitude inſiſted
                    upon putting them to inſtant death ; and the aſſembly would, in aſhprobability,
                    have been unable to protect them, had ſmt the Marſeillois interfered in their
                    favour.</p>
                <p>The ſuſpenſion of the royal authority was now decreed, and the nation was
                    invited to elect a <hi rend="italic">Convention</hi> to determine the nature
                    of its ſuture government. On this uncommon occaſion all Frenchmen of 21 years of
                    age were declared capable of electing, and of being elected, deputies to the new
                    national Convention. Coni-</p>
                <p>miffioners were, in the mean timc, ſent 011 the fame evening to give to the
                    armies a ſalſe and favourable account of theſe tranſactions. The royal family
                    were ſent to the old palace of the Femple in the midſt of the city, to remain
                    there under a ſtrict guard ; and all perſons of rank who had been attached to
                    them were ſei-r.ed and committed to rhe different priſons.</p>
                <p>To give an idea of the temper of the people of Paris at this time, it is proper
                    to remark, that at the ſame inſtant when the multitude with bloody fury were
                    maf-ſacring tile menial ſervants in the palace, and could fcarcely be reſtrained
                    from offering violence to the Swiſs who were made priſoners, they would ſuſſer
                    no act of pillage to paſs unpuniſhed. Several attempts of this kind were
                    accordingly followed by the inſtant death of the criminals. The plate, the
                    jewels, and money found in the I huilleries were brought to the national
                    aſſembly, and thrown down in the hall. One man, whoſe dreſs and appeal ance
                    beſpoke extreme poverty, caſt upon the table an hat full of gold.—Bu^ the minds
                    of theſe men were elevated by enthuſiaſm ; and they conceived themſelves as at
                    this moment the champions of freedom, and objects of terror to the kings of the
                    earth.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the ſituation of France was extremely critical, and it
                    appeared very doubtful if the new Convention would ever be ſuſſered to aſſemble.
                    La Fayette had accidentally got ſpeedy notice of the events of the 10th of
                    Auguſh He adviſed the magiſtrates of the town of Sedan to impriſon the
                    commiffioners from the national aſſembly when they ſhould arrive there ; which
                    was accordingly donc. He, at the ſame time, publiſhed an addreſs to his ärmyj
                    calling upon them to ſupport the king and the conſtitution°; but finding that
                    they were not to be depended upon, on the 19th Auguſt he left his camp in the
                    night, accompanied only by his ſtaſſ and a few ſervants. They took the rout of
                    Rochefort in Liege, which was a neutral country ; but were met by a party of the
                    enemy, who took them prifoners, and they were detained in Pruffian and Auſtrian
                    dungeons till autumn 1794, when it is ſaid that La Fayette himſelf made lſis
                    efcape. The ſevere treatment of this man was probably a conſiderable error in
                    policy 011 the part of the allies. Fiis fide-lity to his king is very generally
                    admitted; though ſome have entertained ſtrong ſuſpicions of his having°acted a
                    very baſe part to that unfortunate monarch ; and in the Britiſh houſe of commons
                    he has been calied an abandoned ruffian. This expreffion is certainly too
                    ſtrong. His errors ſeem to have been thoſe of the head rather than of the heart
                    ; and at all events, he ſhould have been protected by the allies if ſor no othcr
                    reaſon than to encourage ſubſequent deſertions among the officers of the
                    republican açmy.</p>
                <p>To return from this digreffion. The commiffioners were ſoon ſet at liberty at
                    Sedan, and received with applauſe by the army of La Fayette. General Arthur
                    Dillon at ſirſt entered into the ſentiments of La Fayette; but tlie politic
                    Dumourier diverted him from his purpoſe, and by this means regained his credit
                    with the Jacobins, and was appointed commander in chief. The other generals,
                    Biron, Monteſquieu, Kellerman, and Cuſtine, made no oppoſition to the will of
                    the national aſſembly.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, the combined armies of Auſtria and Pruffia had entered France. The
                    duke of Brunſwickſa</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0178" facs="gri_33125011196389_0184.tif"/>
                <p>army was above 50,000 ſtrong. General Clairfait bad joined him with 15,000
                    Auſtrians, and a conſiderable body of Heſſians, along with 20,000 French
                    emigrants; amounting in all to 90,000 men. To oppoſe theſe, Dumourier had only j
                    7,000 men collected near the point from which the enemy were approaching in
                    I^uxemboulg. The French emigrants had given the duke of Brunſwick- ſuch an
                    account of the diffracted ſtate of their own country, and of the pretended
                    diſaf-fection of ail orders of men towards the ruling faction in Paris, tliat no
                    reſiſtance of any importance was expected. when the combined troops, conſiſting
                    either of ſteady Auſtrian or Hungarian battalions, or of tliofe well
                    diſciplinecl Pruffians wliich the great Frederick had inured to the beſt
                    military diſcipline, were reviewed in Germany before ſetting out on their march,
                    it is faid that the ſpectators, among whom tlic French canſe was not unpopular,
                    beheld them with anxiety and regret, and pitied the unhappy conntry againſt
                    which this irreſiſtible force was directed. The ſoldiers and their officers
                    regarded themſelves as departing for a hunting match, or an e-xcurſion of
                    pleaſure ; and many of the uſual accommodations of an army were ill attended to,
                    ſuch as hoſpitals, &amp;c. The beginning of their progreſs into France
                    juſtiſied theſe expectations. Long-wy ſurrendered after a ſiege of <hi
                        rend="italic"> 15</hi> hours, although well fortified, poffeffed of a
                    garrifon of 3500 men, and defended by 71 pieces of cannon. The news of this
                    event irritated the aſſembly fo much, that they decreed; that, when retaken, the
                    houſes of the citizens ſhonld be razed to the ground ; and,, diſtruftful of the
                    officers of the army, they decreed that the municipal officers of a town ſhould
                    hereafter have power to controul the de-liberations of the- council of war.
                    Verdun was next ſummoned ; and here the municipality compelled the governor M.
                    Bèaurepiare to ſurrender. That officer, diſappointed and enraged, ſhot himſelf
                    dead with a pi-ſtol in preſence of the council, and on the 2d of Sep-tember the
                    Pruffian troops entered the town.</p>
                <p>The news of this ſecond capture, and of the ap-p-roach of the Pruffians, fpread
                    an ſuſſant alarm through Paris. It was propoſed to raiſe a volunteer army, which
                    ſhould ſet out immediately to meet the enemy. The -common council, which was now
                    led by Robefpierre, Danton, Marat, and others of the moſt ſanguinary character,
                    ordered the alarm-guns to be fired, and the populace to be ſummoned- to meet in
                    the Champ de Mars to enroll themſelves to march againſt the enemy. The people
                    aſſembled, and either in conſequence of a premeditated plan, or, which is not
                    very probable, of an inſtantaneous movement, a number of voices exclaimed, that
                    " the domeſtic foes of the na-tion ought to be deſtroyed before its foreign
                    enemies were attacked.”</p>
                <p>Parties of armed men proceeded without delay to the priſons where the non-juring
                    clergy, the Swiſs offi-cers, and thoſe confined ſince the 10th of Auguſt on
                    account of practices againſt the ſtate, were detained in cuſtody. They took out
                    the priſoners one by one, gave them a kind of mock trial before a jury of
                    them-ſelves, acquitted ſome few, and murdered the reft. A-mong theſe laſt was
                    the princeſs de Lamballe. She was taken from her bed before this bloody
                    tribunal, and maffacred; her head was carried by the populace to the Temple, to
                    be ſeen by the queen, whoſe friend ſhe was.</p>
                <p>Thefe maſſacrcs laſted for two days, and upwards oſ 1000 perfons were put to
                    death. There is ſcarce any thing in hiſtory that can be repreſented as parallel
                    to them ; they were committed, it is ſaid, by lefs than 300 men, in the midſt of
                    an immenſe city, which heard of them with horror, and in the vicinity of the
                    national affembly, which, by going in a body, could have put an end to them. But
                    ſuch was the confuſion and diſmay of theſe two diſgraceſul days, that no man
                    dared to ſtir ſrom his own houſe ; and every one belie-ved that the whole city,
                    excepting his own ſtreet, was engaged in maffacre and bloodſhed. The national
                    guards were all ready at their reſpective poſts, but no man directed them to act
                    : and there is too much reaſon· to ſuſpect that Santerre and the chiefs of the
                    com-mune connived, at leaſt, at the tranſaction.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, general Dumourier was taking the beſt meafures to protract the
                    march of the enemy till the army of Kellerman, conſiſting of 20,000 men, could
                    join him from Lorraine, and that of Bournonville from Flanders, amounting to
                    13,000; together with whatever new levies Luckner might be able to ſend him from
                    Chalons. The foreſt of Argonne extends from north to ſouth upwards of 40 miles ;
                    it lay direct-ly in the route of the duke of Brunſwick, who muſt either force
                    his way acroſs it, or make a circuit of 40 miles by the paſs of Grandpré on the
                    north, or by Bar-leduc on tbe ſouth. The paſs that lay directly in his route was
                    that of Bieſme. After ſurveying Dillon’s poſition here, he left a party of
                    20,000 men to watch it ; and with the main body of his army took the cir-cuitous
                    rout by Grandpré on the north. Here Du-mourier waited to receive him, and was
                    attacked on the 12th and 13th without ſucceſs: but on the 14th, the attack of
                    the Pruffians was irreſiſtible, and Dumourier retreating, gave up the paſs. On
                    his march he was ſo violently preffed by the advanced cavalry of the Pruſ-ſians,
                    that his army, at one time, was ſeized with a pa* nic, and fled before 1500 men
                    ; who, if they had puſh-ed their advantage, might have diſperſed it. On the
                    15th, however, Dumourier encamped at St Menehould, and began to fortify it.
                    Bournonville’s army joined Dumourier on the 17th. The duke ef Brunſwick formed a
                    plan of attacking Kellerman before his junc-tion could be completed. That
                    general arrived on the 19th within a mile of Dumourier’s camp ; the project-ed
                    attack took place ; the Pruffians, manoeuvred- with thcir ufual coolneſs and
                    addreſs ; they attempted to ſurround Kellerman’s army, but this could not be
                    ac-compliſhed. The French troops- preſerved excellent order, while the national
                    vivacity was conſtantly ſhowing itſelf in their ſhouts and patriotic ſongs : 40O
                    French were killed, and 500 wounded ; the lofs of the Pruffians was much greater
                    : and,, in the face of the enemy, Kellerman joined Dumourier at the end of the
                    engagement without oppoſition. At the time that the attack was made on the army
                    of Kellerman, an at-tempt was made to force Dillon’s camp at Bieſme by the
                    20,000 men that had been left in its vicinity, but without ſucceſs ; and this
                    large detachment was thus prevented from croffing the foreſt of Argonne and
                    join-ing the dnke of Brunſwick. It is to be obſerved, that</p>
                <p>. in theſe engagements the French owed their ſuperiority chiefly to the
                    excellence of their artillery ; a circum-ftance which ſerved to convince their
                    enemies that they</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0179" facs="gri_33125011196389_0185.tif"/>
                <p>hàff to contend with regular military bodies, and not with undifciplined
                    multitudes, as they expected.</p>
                <p>The duke of Brunſwick encamped his army at La Lun, near the camp of Dumourier.
                    And here the Pruffians began to be in extreme dlſtrefs both from ſickneſs and
                    famine. No temptation could induce the inhabitants of the country to carry
                    proviſions to the hoſtile camp, while at the fame time the French army was
                    abundantly ſupplied.</p>
                <p>Bournonville, with a body of 4000 men, intercepted ſeveral droves of cattle and
                    other convoys of proviſions deſtined for the Pruffians. The rain fell in
                    torrents, and the roads were uncommonly deep. Expoſed to the cold, the moiſture,
                    and want of proviſions, the Pruffians raſhly ate great quantities of the grapes
                    of Champagne. The conſequence of this was, that an epidemical diſtem-per
                    commenced and ſpread through the army to ſuch an extent, that 10,000 men at one
                    time were unfit for duty. The duke of Brunſwick, however, ſtill commanded a
                    force much more numerous than that of Dumourier ; and he has been much cenſured
                    for not attacking his camp, and forcing him to engage. It has been laid, that
                    the veteran and numerous force which he com-manded would have marched to certain
                    victory a-gainſt the raw troops that oppoſed them ; that, having defeated
                    Dumourier’s army, there was nothing to oppoſe their march to Paris. But the duke
                    ot Brunſwick had entered France upon the ſuppoſition, that in its preſent
                    diſtracted ſtate no regular army could be brought into the field againſt him,
                    and that the people at large were hoſtile to the ruling faction. ſſ he contrary
                    of ail this had turned out to be true. He found himſelf in the midſt of an
                    hoſtile people, and op-poſed by ſkilful military chiefs. A defeat in ſuch a
                    ſituation would have brought certain ruin to his army ; and even the loſs
                    ſnſtained in the acquiſition of a victory might have proved equally fatal. ſſ he
                    remains of the French army would not fail to hang upon his rear 5 and from the
                    diſpoſition of the people it appeared impoffible to aſcertain to what amount
                    that army might be ſuddenly increaſed. After propoſing a truce, there-fore,
                    which laſted eight days, he commenced his retreat towards Grandpré, and no
                    advantage v/as gained over him in the courſe of it. Verdun was retaken by the
                    French on the 12th of October, and Longwy on the 18 th; the ſiege of Thionville
                    was at the ſame time raiſed. That ſmall, but ſtrong fortreſs, under the command
                    of general Felix wimpfen, had held in check an army of 15,000 men.</p>
                <p>while the Pruffians were advancing from the north-eaſt, the Auſtrians under the
                    duke of Saxe Tefchen laid ſiege to Liſie. The council-general of the commune
                    anfwered tlte ſummons of the beſiegers thus, "we have juſt renewed our oath to
                    be faithful to the nation,, and to maintain liberty and equality, or to die at
                    our poſt. we wili not perjure ourſelves.” Such was the cant of theſe men who had
                    already perjured themſelves by contributing to overturn the conſtitution which
                    they had repeatedly fworn to defend. The Auſtrian batte-ries began to play upon
                    the town on the 29th, and were chieflydirected againſt that quarter which was
                    inhabi-ted by the lowcr claſs of citizens, for the purpoſe of making them
                    mutinous and ſeditious. This procedure was ill judged. The lower claſtes of
                    mankind are always much accuſtomed to hardſhips, and they go fartheſt in ſupport
                    of any enthuſiaſtic principle they have been perſuaded to adopt. Accordingly,
                    though a great part of the ciry was reduced to a heap of ruins, the citizens of
                    Liſie became daily more obſtinate. They received each other into the houſes that
                    were ſtill ſtanding, and every vault and cellar was occupied. Although up-wards
                    of 30,000 red-hot balls and 6000 bombs were thrown into the city, beſides the
                    efforts made by an im-menſe battering train of artillery, yet the loſs both to
                    the garriſon and people did not exceed 500 pet ſons, moſt of whom were women and
                    children. Aſter a fortnight of fruitlefs labour the Auſtrians raiſed the ſiege.</p>
                <p>war had been declared againſt the king of Sardinia on account of the threatening
                    appearances exhibited in that quarter. On the 20th of September general
                    Montefquieu entered the territories of Savoy, and was received at Chambery and
                    throughout the whole country with marks of unbounded welcome. On the 29th
                    general Anſelm, with another body of troops, took poffeffion of Nice and the
                    conntry around it. On the 30th general Cuſtine advanced to Spires, when he found
                    the Auſtrians drawn up in order of battle. Hc attacked and drove them through
                    the city, taking 3000 of them priſoners. The capture of worms ſucceeded that of
                    Spires; Mentz ſurrendered by capitulation; and Franckfort fell into the hands of
                    the French on the 23d. Out of this laſt place, however, they were afterwards
                    driven on the 2d of December.</p>
                <p>On the 20th of September the French <hi rend="italic">National Convention</hi> affembled. It was found to contain men of all characters, orders, and ranks.
                    Many diſtinguiſhed members of the <hi rend="italic">Conftituting</hi> Affembly
                    were elected into it, and alſo ſeveral that had belonged to the <hi
                        rend="italic"> Legflalive</hi> Aſſembly ; even foreigners were invited to
                    become French lcgiſſators. The famous Thomas Paine and Dr Prieſtley of England
                    were elected by certain depart-ments ; but the latter declined accepting. Clouts
                    a Pruffian, whom we formerly noticed as bringing a de-putation to the bar of the
                    conſtituent affembly, conſi ſt-ing of perſons repreſenting all the nations of
                    the earth, was alſo choſen. The general aſpect of the new convention ſhowed that
                    the republican party liad acquired a de-cided ſuperiority. On the ſirſt day
                    oſcrneeting M. Collot D’Herbois, who had formerly been an actor, aſcendcd the
                    tribune, and propoſed <hi rend="italic">the eternal abolition of royalty in
                        France.</hi> The queſtion was carried by acclamation, and the houſe
                    adjourned. Meffages were ſent to all parts of the country to intimate the
                    decree, and by the influence of the Jacobins they were everywhere re-ceived with
                    applauſe. It was next day decreed, that all public acts ſhould be dated by the
                    year of the French republic ; and all citizens were declared eligible to all the
                    vacant offices and places. The rage of republica-niſm ſoon went ſo far, that the
                    ordinary titles of Mon-ſieur and Madame were aboliſhed, and the appellation of <hi rend="italic">Citizen</hi> ſubſtituted in their ſtead, as more
                    ſuitable to the principles of liberty and equality.— It may be re«= marked, that
                    in this laſt trifling circumſtance an attachment to the form of ſpeech to which
                    they had been accuſtomed appears even in its abolition : For, al-though the
                    Roman orators addreffed their countrymen when affembled by the honourable
                    appellation of <hi rend="italic">Citizens,</hi> yet they never, in accoſting
                    an individual, called him Citizen Cato, or Citizen Cæfar, according to the mode
                    now adopted in France.</p>

                <p>It was ſoon diſcovered that the leading.republicans had divided into two
                    oppoſite factions. The one of theſe was called <hi rend="italic">Girondßs</hi> , becaufe V'ergniaud, Gen-ſoene, Guadet, and ſome others of its leaders, were
                    members from the department of La Gironde. The celebrated Condorcet belonged to
                    this party; and they were ſometimes denominated <hi rend="italic">Bofſfihnes,</hi> from M. Briſſot de warville their principal leader. They ſupported the
                    miniſtry now in officc, at the head of which was Roland ; and the majority of
                    the convention was obviouſly attachetſ to them. In oppoſition to theſc was the
                    ſmaller party of the <hi rend="italic">M untrnn ;</hi> fo called from its
                    members uſually ſitting in the convention on the upper feats of the hall. They
                    were men poſſeſſed of lefs perfonal reſpectability, and fewer literary
                    accompliſhments, but oſ daring and ſanguinary characters, whom the revolu-t ion
                    had brought into public notice. At the head of this party were Danton and
                    Robefpierre ; and ſubor-dinate to theſe were Couthon, Bazire, Thuriot, Mer-hn de
                    Thionville, St Andre, Camille Demoulins, Chabot, Collot D’Herbois, Sergent,
                    Legendre, Fabre D’Eglantine, Panis, and Marat.</p>
                <p>ſ heſc two parties ſhowed the diverſity of their characters in the manner in
                    which they treated the maſſacres of the 2d and 3d of September. The Briſſotines,
                    with the majority of the convention, wiſhed to bring the murderers to trial ;
                    but the queſtion was always eluded by the other party, with the aſſiſtance of
                    the Jacobin cſub and of the populace.</p>
                <p>On the 9th oſ October it was decreed, that all emigrants, when taken, ſhould
                    ſuſſer death; and on the 15th oſ November, in confeqnence of an infurrection in
                    the duchy of Deux Ponts, and an application on the part of the inſurgents to the
                    convention ſor aid,the following decree was paſſed : " The national convention
                    declare, in the name of the French nation, that they will grant fraternity and
                    affiſtance to ali thoſe people who wiſh to procure liberty ; and they clſarge
                    the executive power to ſend orders to the generals to give aſſlſtance to ſuch
                    people as liave ſuffered, or are now ſuſfering, in the cauſe oſ liberty.” Of
                    this decree foreign nations, with great reaſon, complained much, as will ſhortly
                    appear.</p>
                <p>To return to the military affairs of the new republic. On the 12th of October
                    General Dumourier came to Paris, and was ſpeedily ſent to commence a winter
                    campaign in the Netherlands. He ſuddenly attacked the Auſtrians at the village
                    of Boffu, and drove them from their ground. On the 5th oſ November he came in
                    ſight of the enemy upon the heights of <hi rend="italic">Je-mappe.</hi> .Three
                    rows of fortifications aroſe above each other defended by 100 pieces of cannon.
                    Their right was covered by the village and a river, and thcir left by thick
                    woods. The French were by their ovzn account 30,000, whilſt others with great
                    probability of truth compute them at double that number, and the number of the
                    Auſtrians was at leaſt 20,000. At ſeven in the morning of the following day a
                    heavy cannonade com-menced on both ſides, and at noon a cloſe attack was
                    determined on by the French, whoſe right wing was commanded by Generals
                    Bournonville and Dampierre, and the centre by Generals Egalité (ſon to the duke
                    of Orleans who had affumed that name), Stetenboffe, Deſporets, and Drouet. The
                    muſic played thepopu-Iar march of the Marſeillois, and the ſoldiers ruſhed on
                    with enthuſiaſm, ſhouting " Vive la nation.” The en-'</p>
                <p>gagement was warm and bloody ; the French were twice repulſed ; but their
                    impetuoſity was at laſt irreſiſtible, and about two o’clock the enemy fled from
                    their laſt entrenchments. The loſs on both ſides was very great, that of the
                    Auſtrians amounting to 400c. This victory was deciſive of the fate of the
                    Netherlands. Mons and Bruſſels ſurrendered to Dumourier ; 'ſmurnay, Malines,
                    Ghent, and Antwerp, were taken poſſeſſion of by General Labourdonnaye ; Louvain
                    and Namur were taken by General Valence ; and the whole Auſtrian Netherlands,
                    Luxembourg pnly excepted, fell into the hands of the French : Liege was taken on
                    the 28th of November after a ſuccefsful engagement, in which the Auſtrians loſt
                    5 or 600 men and an immenſe train of artillery.</p>
                <p>France was now in a ſituation not unuſual in.the hiſtory of thoſe nations that
                    either are free, or are at-tempting to become ſo; ſucceſsful in all quarters
                    abroad, but diſtracted by factions at home. Ί he two parties in the convention
                    were engaged in a ſtruggle, which daily became more implacable. The party called
                    the <hi rend="italic">Mountain</hi> did not hêfitate about the nature of the
                    means they were to employ to bring about the ruin of their antagoniſts. 1 hey
                    are even ſuſpected of having, through the medium of Fache the war-miniſter,
                    retarded the ſupply of the armies, to render the ruling party odious by want of
                    ſucceſs. They were for fome time, however, unfortunate in this reſpect ; and the
                    daily news· of victories ſupported with the public the credit of the Girondiſts.
                    A new ſubject was therefore fallen upon, which was the queſtion, how the
                    dethroned king was to be diſpoſcd of? The moderate patty wiſhed to ſave him ;
                    and this was a ſufficient reaſon for their antago-nill s to reſolve upon his
                    ruin. A committee was ap-poiuted to give in a report upon his conduct. A variety
                    of accuſations were brought againſt him ; and the convention inſamouſly refolved
                    co act the part of ac-cufers and of judges.</p>
                <p>It was on the 1 1 th of December when the ill-fated monarch was ordered to the
                    bar of the convention : the act of accuſation was read, and the king was
                    ſummon-ed by the preſident, Barrere, to anſwer to each ſcparate chargç.</p>

                    him, that his two firſt requeſts were already decreed, and that the
                    determination reſpecting the other would be made known to him in due time.</p>
                <p>It would liave been an excefs of cruelty to refuſe a requeſt ſo reaſonable in
                    itfelf ; it was therefore decreed that counſel ſhould be allowed to the king,
                    and his choice fell upon M. M. Tronchet, Lamoignon Male-ſherbes, and Deſeze ; he
                    liad previouſiy applied to M Target, who excuſed himſelf on account of his age
                    and infirmity. On the 26th of December, the king appeared for the laſt time at
                    the bar of the convention ; and M. Deſeze read a defence which the counfel liad
                    prepared, and which was equally admired for tlie ſolidity of the argument and
                    the beauty of the compoſition.</p>
                <p>when the defence was ſiniſhed, the king aroſe, and holding a paper in his hand,
                    pronounced in a calm manner, and with a ſirm voice, what follows : “ Citizens,
                    you have heard my defence ; I now ſpeak to you, perhaps for the laſt time, and
                    declare that my counſel have afferted nothing„to you but the truth ; my
                    confcience reproaches me with nothing : 1 never was afraid of having my conduct
                    inveſtigated ; but I obſerved with great uneaſi-neſs, that I was accuſed of
                    giving orders for ſhedding the blood of the people on the 10th of Auguſt. The
                    proofs I have given through my whole life of a contra-ry diſpoſition, I hoped
                    would have ſaved me from ſucli an imputation, which I now ſolemnly declare is
                    entire-ly groundleſs.”</p>
                <p>The difcuffion was fatally cloſed on tlie 16th of Ja-nuary. After a fitting of
                    near 34 hours, the puniſhment of death was awarded by a ſmall majority of the
                    convention, and ſeveral of theſe differed in opinion from the reſt, reſpecting
                    the time when it ſhould be inflicted; ſome contending that it ſhould not be put
                    in execution till after the end of the war, while others propoſed to take tlie
                    ſenſe of the people, by referring the ſentence to the primary affetnblies.</p>
                <p>M. Deſeze then ſolemnly invoked the aſſembly in the name of his colleagues, to
                    conſider by what a ſmall majority tlie puniſhment of death was pronounced
                    againſt the dethroned monarch. " Do not afflict France (added this eloquent
                    advocate) by a judgment that will appear terrible to her, when <hi rend="italic"
                        > ſtve</hi> voices only were</p>
                <p>VVT T <hi rend="sup">J</hi></p>
                <p>prefnmed ſnfficient to carry it.” He appealed to eternal jnſtice, and ſacred
                    humanity, to induce the convention to refer their ſentence to the tribunal of
                    the people. “ You have either forgotten or deſtroyed (ſaid the ce-lebrated M.
                    Tronchet) the lenity which the law allows to criminals, of requiring at leaſt <hi rend="italic">two-thirds</hi> of the voices to conſtitute a definitive
                    judgment,”</p>
                <p>I'he ſentence was ordered to be executed in twenty-four hours.</p>
                <p>The king and his family had been for ſome time kept ſeparate from each other ;
                    but he was now allowed to ſee them, and to chooſe an eccleſiaſtic to attend him.
                    The meeting, and, above all, the ſeparation from his family, was tender in the
                    extreme. On Monday the 2iſt January, at eight o’clock in the morning, the
                    unfortunate monarch was ſummoned to his fate. He afcended the ſcaſſold with a
                    ſirm air and ſtep. Raiſing his voice, he ſaid, " Frenchmen, I die innocent ; I
                    pardon all my enemies; and may France”—at this inſtant the inhuman Santerre
                    ordered the drums to beat, and the executioners to perform their office, when
                    they offered to bind his hands, he ſtarted back as if about to refill ; but
                    recollected himfelf in a moment, and ſubmitted. when the inſtrument of death
                    deſcended, the prieſt exclaimed, " Son of St Louis, afcend to heaven.” The
                    bleeding head was held up, and a few of the populace ſhouted <hi rend="italic">Vive la République.</hi> His body was interred in a grave that was ſilled
                    up with quicklime, aud a guard placed around till it ſhould be conſumed.</p>
                <p>Ί hus fell Louis XVI. He poſſeſſed from nature a good underſtanding, which,
                    however, was blunted by the early indulgences of a court. He had a ſtrong ſenſe
                    of jnſtice, and his humanity was perhaps extreme. One defect rendered his
                    virtues of little va-lue, whieh was the poſſeffion of an irreſolute and
                    un-ſteady character. Unambitious, and eaſily adviſed, he was without difficulty
                    induced to change his purpoſes, efpecially by his queen, whoſe connection with
                    the houſe oſ Auſtria had always tended to render his coun-ſels unpopular,
                    whether he was or was not connected with the foreign invaders of his country,
                    poſterity muſt decide ; but all men of ſenſe and moderation muſt be convinced
                    that he was murdered by a band of ruffians. Indeed a ſentence ſo infamous, and
                    in all reſpects un-juſt, is not to be found in the records of hiſtory. The
                    greater part of the charges brought againſt him werc trifling. Thoſe which ſeem
                    to be of importance re-late to conduct authorized by the conſtitution under
                    which he acted ; and that conſtitution declared his perſon inviolable. The
                    fevereſt puniſhment that he could incur by law, was not death, but depoſition ;
                    and there is no doubt, that in putting him to death the French nation broke the
                    ſocial compact which their repreſen-tatives made with him. In a political view,
                    this tragical event was injurious to the republican caufe throughout Europe. No
                    man out of France ventured to juſti-fy it ; and in all countries it excited the
                    moſt violent indignation againſt the rulers of tlie new republic.</p>
                <p>New enemies were now haſtening to join the general league againſt France, we do
                    not mean here to enter into a detail of the political ſtruggles tliat occurred
                    in any other country, than tliat in the narrative of whoſe revolution we are now
                    engaged. It will therefore only be neceſſary to remark in general, that the
                    Britiſh go-verment at this time thought itſelf endangered by the propagation of
                    thoſe ſpeculative opinions which had</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0186" facs="gri_33125011196389_0192.tif"/>
                <p>overturned the French monarchy. Almoſt all the men of property in the kingdom
                    concurred with the miniſtry in thinking a war with France neceſſary for the
                    pur-poſe of ſecuring the conſtitution at home. After the loth of Auguſt the
                    Britiſh miniſter had been recalled ; but the new republic ſtill ſuffered the
                    former ambaſſa-dor from France, M. Chauvelin, to remain in England.</p>
                <p>The oftenſible grounds of quarrel on the part of Great Britain were chiefly two
                    ; the decree oſ the 15th of November 1792, by which it was truly obſerved that
                    encouragement to rebellion was held out to tlie ſubjects of every ftate, and
                    that war was thereby waged againſt every eſtabliſhed government. Of this decree
                    the French executive council gave explanations, denying tlie fairneſs of the
                    interpretation put upon it, and alleging, that the intention of the convention
                    was only to give aid to fuch countries as <hi rend="italic">had already</hi> acquired their freedom, and by a declaration of the general will requeſted aid
                    for its preſervation. But this explanation cannot be admitted. The decree
                    expreſsly ſays, that the French nation will <hi rend="italic">grant
                        coffiftancedo all who wifh to procure liberty ;</hi> and when it is
                    conſidered what their notions of liberty are, it cannot be doubted but that
                    their intention was to excite rebellion in foreign nations. The ſecond point of
                    diſpute referred to the opening of the Scheldt. This river runs from Brabant
                    through the Dutch territory to the ſea. The Dutch had ſhut up the mouth of it,
                    and prevented any maritime commerce from being carried on by the people of
                    Brabant by means of the river. To render themfelves popular in Brabant, ;he
                    French had declared, that they would open the navigation of the Scheldt. But
                    Great Britain had ſome time before bound herſelf by treaty with the Dutch to
                    affiſt them in obſtructing this nayigation, and now declared to the French, that
                    the project of opening the Scheldt mnſt be renounced if peace with Great Britain
                    was to remain. The French alleged, that by the law of nations navigable rivers
                    ought to be' open to all who reſide on their banks ; but that the point was of
                    no importance either to France or England, and even of very little importance to
                    Holland ; that if the people of Brabant themſelves choſe to give it up, they
                    would make no objection. It has been thought remarkable, that the Dutch gave
                    themſelves no trouble about the matter. They did not aſk the aſſlſtance of
                    England ; and with that coolneſs which is peculiar to their character, the
                    merchants in-dividually declared, tliat if the Scheldt was opened, they could
                    manage tlieir commerce as well at Antwerp as at Amſterdam. But in all this there
                    is nothing ſtrange. Among tlic Dutch were many republicans, wlio wiſhed for the
                    downfal of the ſtadtholder. Tlieſe rejoiced at every thing wliich diſtreſſed
                    him, or had a tendency to render his office uſeleſs in the eyes of the people.
                    Others, who thought diſſerently, were afraid to ſpeak their ſentiments,, as
                    Dumourier was in their neighbourhood with a victorious army. The reſult of the
                    whole was, that M. Chauvelin was commanded by the Brſtiſh government to leave
                    this country. The French executive council gave powers to another mini-ſter, M.
                    Maret, to negociate, and requeſted a paſſport for him ; but he was not ſuſſered
                    to land. The haughty republicans having thus ſar humbled themſelves before the
                    Britiſh government, at laſt, on the iſt of February 1793, on the motion of
                    Briſſot, the national convention decreed, among other articles, that " George
                    king of England had never ceaſed ſince the revolution</p>
                <p>of the 10th of Auguſt 1792 from giving to the French nation proofs of his
                    attachment to the concert of crowned heads ; that he had drawn into the ſame
                    lake the ſtadtholder of the United Provinces ; that, contrary to the treaty of
                    1783, the Engliſh miniſtry had granted protection to the emigrants and others
                    who have openly appeared in arms againſt France; that they have committed an
                    outrage againſt the French repnb-lic, by ordering the ambaſſador of France to
                    quit Great Britain ; that the Engliſh have ſtopped divers boats and veſſels
                    laden with corn for France, whilſt, at tlie ſame time, contrary to the tieaty of
                    1786, they con-tinue the exportation of it to other foreign countries ; that to
                    thwart more efficaciouſiy the commercial tranſ-actions of the republic with
                    England, they have by an act of parliament prohibited the cmculation of
                    aſſignats. The convention therefore <hi rend="italic">declare,</hi> that in
                    conſequence of tliefe acts of hoſtility and aggreffion, the French republic is
                    at war with the king of England and tlie ſtadtholder of the United Provinces.”</p>
                <p>The abſurdity of pretending tliat any treaty with France made in 1783 could be
                    violated hy protecting the emigrants who fled from the fury of tlie convention,
                    muſt be obvious to every reader. The convention was itſelf a rebellious
                    uſurpation of tlie government with which ſuch a treaty was made. The prohibition
                    of affignats was certainly contrary to no law, and was ſanc-tioned by every
                    motive oſ expediency, unleſs tlie convention could prove that all nations were
                    bound by the law of nature to riſk their own credit upon tlie credit of the
                    Frencll republic.</p>
                <p>About a fortnight after this abſurd declaration againſt Britain, war was
                    likewiſe declared againſt Spain ; and in tlie courſe of tlie ſummer France was
                    at war with all Europe, excepting only Swiſſerland, Sweden, Den* mark, and
                    Turkey.</p>
                <p>In the mean time General Dumourier, who was proceeding agreeably to his orders,
                    made an attack upon Holland ; but in doing this he diſperſed his troops in ſucli
                    a manner as to expoſe them much to any attack on the ſide of Germany. He
                    commanded General Mi-randa to inveſt Maeſtricht, while he advanced to block up
                    Breda and Bergen-op-zoom. The ſirſt of theſe places, viz. Breda,ſurrendered on
                    the 24th of February; Klundert was taken on the 26th ; and Gertruydenberg on the
                    4th of March. But here tlie triumphs of Dumourier ended. The ſieges of
                    williamſtadt and Bergen-op-zoom were vigorouſty but unſucceſsſully preſſed. On
                    tbe iſt of March General Clairfait having paſſed the Roer, attacked the French
                    poſts, and compelled them to retreat with tlie loſs of 2000 men.</p>
                <p>The following day the archduke attacked them anew with conſiderable ſucceſs. On
                    the 3d the French were driven from Aix-la-Chapelie, with the loſs of 4000 men
                    killed and 1600 taken priſoners.</p>
                <p>The ſiege of Maeſtricht was now raiſed, and the French retreated to Tongres,
                    where they were alſo at-tacked and forced to retreat to St Tron. Dumourier here
                    joined them, but did not bring his army along with him from the attack upon
                    Holland. After ſome ſkirmiſhes a general engagement took place at Neer-winden.
                    It was fought on the part of the French with great obſtinacy ; but they were at
                    length over-? powered by the number of their enemies, and perhaps alfo by the
                    treachery of their commander. This de-feat was fatal. The French loſt 3000 men,
                    and <hi rend="italic">6oz&gt;o</hi></p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0187" facs="gri_33125011196389_0193.tif"/>
                <p>immediately deſerted and went borne to France. Dumou-rier continued to retreat,
                    and on the 2 2d he was again attacked near Louvain. He now, through the medium
                    of Colonel Mack, came to an agreement with the Im-perialiſts that his retreat
                    ſhould not be ſeriouſſy inter-fupted. It was now fully agreed between him and
                    the Imperialiſts, that while the latter took poffeffion of Condé and
                    Valenciennes, he ſhould march to Paris, diffolve the convention, and place the
                    ſon of the late king upon the throne.</p>
                <p>The rapid retreat and ſucceffive defeats of General Dumourier rendered his
                    conduct ſuſpicious. Commiſ-ſioners were ſent from the executive power for the
                    purpoſe of diſeovering his deſigns. They diffembled, and pretended to
                    communicate to him a ſeheme of a coun-ter-revolution. He confeffed his intention
                    of diffolving the convention and the Jacobin club by force, which he ſaid would
                    not exiſt three weeks longer, and of re-ſtoring monarchy. On the report of theſe
                    commiſe fioners the convention ſent Bournonville the miniſter of war to
                    ſuperſede and arreſt Dumourier, along with Camus, Blancal, La Marque, and
                    Quinette, as commiffioners.' The attempt on the part of theſe men was at leaſt
                    hazardous, to ſay no more of it ; and the reſult was, that on the ſirſt of April
                    Dumourier ſent them priſoners to General Clairfait’s head quarters at Tournay as
                    hoſtages for the ſaſety of the royal family. He next attempted to feduce his
                    army from their fidelity to the convention ; but he ſpeedily found that he had
                    much miſtaken the character of his troops. Upon the report that their general
                    was to be carried as a criminal to Paris, they were ſeized with ſudden
                    indignation; but when they found that an attempt was making to pre-vail with
                    them to turn their arms againſt their country, their ſentiments altered. On the
                    5th of April two proclamations were iffued ; one by General Dumourier, and the
                    other by the prince of Saxe Cobourg, declaring that their only pnrpoſe was to
                    reſtore the conſtitution of 1789, 1790» and 1791. Prince Cobourg announ-ced that
                    the allied powers wiſhed merely to co-operate with General Dumourier in giving
                    to France her con-ſtitutſcnal king and the conſtitution ſhe had formed for
                    herſelf, declaring, on his word of honour, that he came not to the French
                    territory for the purpoſe of making conqueſts. O11 the ſame day Dumourier went
                    to the advanced guard of his own camp at Maulde. He there learned that the corps
                    of artillery had riſen upon their general, and were marching to Valenciennes ;
                    and he ſoon found that the whole army had determined to ſtand by their country.
                    Seven hundred cavalry and 800 infantry was the whole amount of thoſe that
                    deſerted with Dumourier to the Auftrians, and many oſ them afterwards returned.</p>
                <p>By the defection of Dumourier, however, the whole army of the north was
                    diffolved, and in part diſhanded, in preſence of a numerous, well-diſciplined,
                    and victorious enemy. The Pruffians were at the ſame time advancing on the Rhine
                    with an immenſe force, and about to commence the ſiege of Mentz. In the interior
                    of the republic more ſerious evils if poſſible were ariſing. In the departments
                    of La Vendée and La Loire, or the Provinces of Brittany and Poitou, immenſe
                    multitudes of emigrants and other royaliſts had gradually aſſembled in the
                    courſe of the winter. They proſeſſed to act in the name oſ Monſieur, as regent
                    oſ France.</p>
                <p>About the middle oſ March they advanced againſt Nantz to the amount of 40,000.
                    In the beginning oſ April they defeated the republicans in two pitched battles,
                    and poſſeſſed themſelves oſ 50 leagues oſ country. They even threatened by their
                    own efforts to ſhake the new republic to its foundation. On the 8th oſ April a
                    congreſs of the combined powers aſſembled at Antwerp. It was attended by the
                    prince of Orange and his two ſons, with his excellency Vander Spiegel, on the
                    part of Holland ; by the duke of York and Lord Auckland on the part of Great
                    Britain ; by the prince of Saxe Cobourg, Counts Metterinch, Staren-berg, and
                    Mercy Dargenteau, with the Pruffian, Spa-niſh, and Neapolitan envoys. It was
                    here determined to commence active operations againſt France. The prince of
                    Cobourgſa proclamation was recalled, and a ſcheme of conqueſt announced.</p>
                <p>Commiffioners from the convention now ſet up the ſtandard of the republic anew,
                    and tlie ſeattered battalions flocked around it. General Dampierre was appointed
                    commander, andon the 13th lie was able to reſiſt a general attack upon his
                    advanced poſts. On tlie 14th, his advanced guard yielded to ſuperior numbers,
                    but on tlie 15th was victorious in a long and well-fought battle. On the ' 23d
                    tlie Auſtrians were again repulſed, and on the iſt of May General Dampierre was
                    himſelf repulſed in an attack upon tlic enemy. On the 8th another engagement
                    took place, in which tlie French general was killed by a cannon ball. On the 23d
                    a very determined attack was madc by the allies upon the French fortified camp
                    of Famars, which covered the town of Valenciennes. I'he French were overcome,
                    and in the night abandoned their camp. In confeqnence of this the allies were
                    enabled to commence the ſiege of Valenciennes ; for Condé had been blockaded
                    from the lſt of April.</p>
                <p>About the ſame time General Cuſtine on the Rhine made a violent but unſucceſsful
                    attack upon the Pruſc ſians, in conſequence of which they were ſoon enabled to
                    lay ſiege to Mentz. The Corſican General Paoli revolted at this period ; and
                    tlie new republic, affaulted ſrom without by the whole ſtrength oſ Europe, was
                    un-dermined by treachery and faction within.</p>
                <p>while the country was in a ſtate verging upon utter ruin, parties in the
                    convention were gradually waxing more fierce in their animoſity ; and regardleſs
                    oſ what was paffing at a diſtance, they ſeemed only anxious ſor the
                    extermination oſ each other. In the month oſ March, the celebrated <hi
                        rend="italic"> Revolutionary Tribunal</hi> was eſta-bliſhed ſor the purpoſe
                    oſ trying crimes committed a-gainſt the ſtate; and the Girondiſt party, the
                    mildneſs oſ whoſe adminiſtration had contributed not a little to increaſe the
                    evils oſ their country, began to ſee the neceffity oſ adopting meaſures oſ
                    ſeverity. But the pub-lic calamities, which now rapidly followed each other in
                    fucceffion, were aſeribed by their countrymen to their imbecillity or perfidy.
                    This gave to the party oſ tlie <hi rend="italic">Mountain</hi> a fatal
                    advantage. On the 15th oſ April tlie communes of the 48 ſections oſ Paris
                    preſented a petition, requiring that the chiefs oſ the Girondiſts therein named
                    ſhould be impeached and expelled from the convention. This was followed up on
                    the lit of May by another petition from the ſuburb of St Antoine. The Girondiſt
                    party in the mean time impeached Marat, but he was acquitted by the jury at his
                    trial. '1 he</p>

                <p>Mountain, by the aſſiſtance of the Jacobin club, had now acquired a complete
                    aſcendancy over the city of Paris. The Girondiſts or Briſſotines propoſed
                    therefore to remove the convention from the capital ; and to prevent this, rhe <hi rend="italic">Mountain</hi> reſolved to make the ſame uſe of the
                    people of the capital -againſt the Girondiſt party that they had formerly done
                    againſt the monarch on the I oth of Auguſt. It is unneceſſary to ſtate in detail
                    all the tumults that occurred either in Paris or in the convention during the
                    remaining part of the month of May. On the 31ft, at four o’clock in the morning,
                    the tociin was founded, the generale was beat, and the alarm guns fired. All was
                    commotion and terror. The citizens flew to arms, and aſſembled round tbe
                    convention. Some deputations demanded a decree of accuſation againſt 35 of its
                    members. The day, however, was ſpent without deciſion. On the afternoon of the
                    iſt of June an armed force made the ſame demand. On the 2d of June this was
                    repeated, the tocſin again founded, and an hundred pieces of cannon ſurrounded
                    the national hall. At laſt Barfere mounted the tribune. He was confidered as a
                    moderate man, and reſpected by both parties ; but he now artfully deſerted the
                    Girondiſts. He invited the denounced members voluntarily to reſign their
                    character of repreſentatives. Some of them complied, and the preſident attempted
                    to diſſolve the ſitting ; but the members were now imprifoned in their own hall.
                    Henriot, commander of the armed force, compelled them to remain ; and the
                    obnoxious deputies, amounting to upwards of 90 in number, were put under arreſt,
                    and a decree of denunciation againſt them ſigned.</p>
                <p>It is obvious, that on this' occaſion the liberties of France were trodden under
                    foot. The minority of the national repreſentatives, by the aſſlſtance of an
                    armed force raiſed in the capital, compelled the majority to ſubmit to their
                    meaſures, and took the leading members prifoners. Thus the city of Paris aſſumed
                    to itſelf the whole powers of the French republic ; and the nation was no longer
                    governed by repreſentatives freely cliofen, but by a minority of their members,
                    whoſe ſentiments the city of Paris and the Jacobin club had thought ſit to
                    approve of. Human hiſtory is a maſs of contradictions. The <hi rend="italic">Mountain</hi> party came into power by preaching liberty, and by violating
                    its fundamental principles. How ſar the plea of political neceffity may excuſe
                    their con-duct, we ſhall not venture to decide explicitly. Certain it is,
                    however, that they ſoon commenced a career of the moſt terrible energy both at
                    home and abroad that is to be found in the annals of nations.</p>
                <p>The ſirſt refult of their victory in the capital was ca-lamitous to the republic
                    at large. Briſſot and ſome other deputies eſcaped, and endeavoured to kindle the
                    flames of civil war. In general, however, the influence of the Jacobin club, and
                    of its various branches, was ſuch, that the north of France adhered to the
                    convention as it ſtood ; but the ſouthern departments were ſpeedily in a ſtate
                    of rebellion. Tlie department of Lyons declared the <hi rend="italic">Mountain</hi> party outlawed. Marfeilles and Toulon followed tlie example of Lyons, and
                    entered into a confederacy, which has ſince been known by the appellation of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Faderaliſm.</hi> The departments of La Gironde and Calvades
                    broke out into open revolt. In ſhort, the whole of France was in a ſtate of
                    violent convulſion. Still, however, the enthuſiaſtic garriſons of Mentz and
                    Valenciennes protected it againſt the ſm« mediate entrance of a foreign force,
                    and allowed leiſure for one of its internal factions to gain an aſcendancy, and
                    thereafter to protect its independence. In the mean time, the political
                    entliuſiaſm of all orders of per-fons was ſuch, that even tlie female ſex did
                    not eſcape its contagion. A young woman of the name of Charlotte Cordé, in tlie
                    beginning of July, came from the department of Calvades to devote her life for
                    what ſhe thought the cauſe of freedom and of her country. She requeſted an
                    interview with <hi rend="italic">Marat,</hi> the moſt obnoxious of the
                    Mountain party. Having obtained it, and con-verſed with him calmly for ſome
                    time, ſhe ſuddenly plunged a dagger in his breaſt, and walked careleſsly out of
                    the houſe. She was immediately ſeized and condemned. At the place of execution
                    ſhe behaved with infinite conſtancy, ſhouting <hi rend="italic">Vive la
                        république.</hi> The remains of Marat were interred with great ſplendor,
                    and the convention attended his funeral. His party perhaps derived advantage
                    from the manner of his death, as it ſeemed to fatten the odious charge of
                    affaſ-ſination upon their antagoniſts, and gave them the appearance of ſuffering
                    in the cauſe of liberty. The truth is, that aſſaffination was ſanctioned by both
                    parties under pretence of defending the liberties of the republic.</p>
                <p>One of the ſirſt acts of the Mountain junto after their triumph was to ſiniſh
                    the republican conftitution. Previous to tlieir fall, the Girondiſts liad
                    brought forward tlie plan of a conſtitution, chiefly the work of Condorcet; but
                    it never was ſanctioned by the convention, and was too intricate to be
                    practically uſeful. The new conſtitution now framed, which was afterwards
                    ſanctioned by the nation, but has never yet been put in practice, aboliſhes the
                    former mode of electing the repreſeutatives of the people through the medium of <hi rend="italic">electoral</hi> aſtemblies, and appoints them to be
                    choſen immediately by the <hi rend="italic">primary</hi> aſſemblies, which are
                    made to conſiſt of from 200 to 600 citizens, each man vo-ting by ballot or open
                    vote at his option. There is·· one deputy for every 40,000 individuals, and
                    population is the ſole baſis of repreſentation. The elections take place every
                    year on the iſt of May. Electoral aſtemblies are ſtill retained ſor one purpoſe.
                    Every 200 citizens in the primary aſſemblies name one elector ; and an aſſembly
                    of all the electors of the department is afterwards held, which elects
                    candidates ſor the <hi rend="italic">executive council,</hi> or miniſtry of
                    the republic. The legiſſative body choofes out of this liſt of candidates the
                    members of the executive council. One half of this council is renewed by each
                    legiſſature in the laſt month of the ſeſc ſlon. Every law, after it is paſſed by
                    the legiſſative body, is ſent to the department. Iſ in more than half of the
                    departments the tenth of the primary aſſemblies of each have not objected to it,
                    it becomes effectual.. Trial by jury is eſtabliſhed. National conventions may be
                    called for altering the conſtitution, and <hi rend="italic">muß</hi> be
                    call-ed, if · required by the tenth of the primary affemblies of eacll
                    department in a majority of the departments.</p>
                <p>The publication of tliis conſtitution procured no ſmall degree of applauſe to
                    the convention and the Mountain party. The rapidity with which it was formed
                    (being only a fortnight) ſeemed to caſt a juſt reproach upon the ſſowneſs of
                    their antagoniſts, and it was regarded as a proof of their being decidedly ſe-</p>

                    nor indeed does it ſeem poſ-ſible to carry it into execution.</p>
                <p>we have mentioned that Condé was inveſted from the beginning of April. It did
                    not yield till the loth of July, when the garriſon was ſo much reduced by famine
                    and diſeafe, that out of 4000 men, of which it originally conſiſted, only 1500
                    were ſit for ſervice. The eyes of all Europe were in the mean time ſaxed upon
                    the ſiege of Valenciennes. Colonel Moncrieff had contended, that batteries ought
                    immediately to be placed under the walls without approaching it by regular
                    pa-rallels ; but the Imperial engineer Mr Ferraris afferted, that the work of
                    the great Vanban muſt be treated with more reſpect ; and his opinion was adopted
                    by the council of war. The trenches were opened on the 14th of June. Few ſallies
                    were attempted by the gar-riſon, on account of the ſmallneſs of their number.
                    The inhabitants at ſirſt wiſhed to furrender ; but the violence of the
                    bombardment prevented their affem-bling or giving much trouble on that head to
                    General Ferrand the governor. Much of the labour of the ſiege conſiſted of mines
                    and countermines. Some of theſe having been ſucceſsfully ſprung by the allies,
                    tlie town was ſurrendered on the 27th of July by capitula-tion to the Duke of
                    York, wlio took poſſeffion of it in behalf of the emperor of Germany. The ſiege
                    of Mentz was at the ſame time going on. It ſuſſered much from famine. At laſſ,
                    after an unſucceſsful at-tempt by the French army on the Rhine for its relief,
                    Mentz ſurrendered on the 2 2d of July.</p>
                <p>At the termination of the ſiege of Valenciennes it is ſaid that the allied
                    powers were at a loſs how to pro-ceed next. The Auſtrian commanders are faid to
                    have preſented two plans : The ſirſt was to penetrate to Pa-ris by the
                    affiſtance of the rivers which fall into the Seine ; the other was to take
                    advantage of the conſter-nation occaſioned·by the ſurrender of Valenciennes, and
                    with 50,000 light troops to penetrate ſuddenly to Paris, while a debarkation
                    ſhould be made on the coaſt of Brittany to affiſt the royaliſts. The propoſal of
                    the Britiſh miniſtry was, however, adopted, which was, to divide the grand army,
                    and to attack weſt Flanders, beginning with the ſiege of Dunkirk. This
                    determination proved ruinous to the allies. The French found means to vanquiſh
                    in detail that army, which they <hi rend="sup">1</hi> could not encounter when
                    united.</p>
                <p>It is ſaid that the Duke of York was in fecret cor-reſpondence with Omeron the
                    governor of Dunkirk ; but he was removed before any advantage could be taken of
                    his treachery. On the 24th of Auguſt the Duke of York attacked and drove the
                    French outpoſts into the town, after an action in which the Auſtrian General
                    Dalton was killed. A naval armament was expected from Great Britain to
                    co-operate in the ſiege, but ſt did not arrive. In the mean time, a ſtrong
                    re-publican force menaced the covering army of the allies, wliich was commanded
                    by General Freytag. He was foon attacked and totally routed. The ſiege was
                    raiſed. The Britiſh loſt their heavy cannon and baggage, with ſeveral thouſand
                    men; and the convention, belie-ving that their General Houchard could have cut
                    off the Duke of York’s retreat, tried and executed him for this neglect of duty,</p>
                <p>Prince Cobourg and General Clairfait in the mean time unſucceſsſully attempted
                    to beſiege Cambray and Boucliain. (Queſnoy was, however, taken by General
                    Clairfait on the 1 ith of September ; and here finally terminated for the
                    preſent campaign the ſucceſs of the allies in the Netherlands.</p>
                <p>A conſiderable part of the French army of the north took a ſtrong poſition near
                    Manbeuge, where they were blockaded by Prince Cobourg v but upon the 15th and
                    16th of October he was repeatedly at-tacked by the French troops under General
                    Jourdan, who ſucceeded Houchard. 'I he French had now re-covered their vigour.
                    They brought into the held a formidable train of artillery, in which were many
                    24 pounders. Commiffioners from the convention harangued the ſoldiers,
                    threatened the fearful, and applauded the brave. Crowds of women, without
                    conſuſion, went through the ranks, diſtributing ſpirituous li-quors in
                    abundance, and carrying off the wounded, 'i'he attacks were repeated and
                    terrible on both ſides ; but the Auſtrians had conſiderably the diſadvantage,
                    and Prince Cobourg retired during the night. 3 he French now menaced maritime
                    Flanders. They took Furnes and beſieged Nieuport. A detachment of Britiſh troops
                    ready to fail to the weſt Indies were haſtily ſent to Oſtesd, and prevented for
                    the preſent the farther progreſs of the French.</p>
                <p>Such was the multiplicity of the events that now oc-curred in France, that it is
                    difficult to ſtate the out-lines of them with any tolerable perſpicuity. we have
                    already mentioned the extenſive diſſenſions that occurred throughout the
                    republic in conſequence of the tri-umph of the Mountain party on the 3 iſt of
                    May. The department of Calvades was ſirſt inarms againſt the convention under
                    the command of General Felix wimp-fen ; but before the end of July the
                    infurrection was quieted, after a few flight ſkirmiſhes. But the fœdera-liſm of
                    the cities of Marfeilles, Lyons, and Toulon, ſtill remained. Lyons was attacked
                    on the 8th oſ Auguſt by the conventional troops. Several actions followed, which
                    were attended with great loſs both on the part of the affailants and of the
                    beſieged. The city was re-duced almoſt to ruins ; but it held out during the
                    whole month of September. The beſieging General Kellerman was removed from his
                    command, on account of his ſuppoſed inactivity ; and the city ſurrendered on the
                    8th of October to General Doppet, a man who had lately been a phylieian. Such
                    was the rage of party zeal at this time, that the walls and public buildings of
                    Lyons were ordered to be deſtroyed, and its name changed to that of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Ville Affranchie.</hi> Many hundreds of its citizens were
                    dragged to the ſcaffold 011 account of their alleged treaſonable reſiftance to
                    the convention. The victorious party, wearied by the flow operation of the <hi
                        rend="italic"> guillotine,</hi> at laſt deſtroyed their priſoners in
                    multitudes, by firing grape-ſhot upon them. Such indeed was the unrelenting
                    character of the Mountain at this time, not only here but through the whole
                    republic, that tliey tliemſelves pretended not to excuſe it, but declared that
                    terror was with them <hi rend="italic">the order of the day.</hi></p>
                <p>In the end of July General Cartaux was ſent againſt Marfeilles. In the beginning
                    of Auguſt he gained ſome ſucceffes over the advanced fœderalift troops. On the
                    24th he took the town of Aix, and the Marſellois</p>

                <p>ſubmitted. But the leading people oſ the important town and harbour of Toulon
                    entered into a negociation, and ſubmitted to the Britiſh admiral Lord Hood,
                    under condition that he ſhould preſerve as a depoſtt the town and ſhipping for
                    Louis XVII. and under the ſti-pulation that he ſhould affiſt in reſtoring the
                    conſtitu-tion of 1789. The ſiege of Toulon was commenced by General Cartaux in
                    the beginning of September. It continued without much vigour during that and the
                    whole of the ſucceeding month. Neapolitan, Spaniſh, and Engliſh troops, were
                    brought by ſea to affiſt in its defence. In the beginning of November, General
                    Cartaux was removed to tlie command of tlie army in Italy, and General Dugommier
                    ſucceeded him. General O’ Hara arrived with reinforcements from Gibraltar, and
                    took upon him the command of tlie town, under a commiffion from his Britannic
                    majeſty. On the 30th of November, the garriſon made a powerful ſally to deſtroy
                    ſome batteries tliat were erecting upon heights which commanded tlie city. The
                    French were ſurpriſed, and the allies ſucceeded completely in tlieir object;
                    but, elated by the facility of thcir conqueſt, the allied troops ruſhe'd forward
                    in purſuit of the flying enemy, contrary to their orders, and were unexpected-ly
                    met by a ſtrong French force tliat was drawn out to protect the fugitives.
                    General O’Hara now came from the city to endeavour to bring off liis troops with
                    regularity. He was wounded in tlie arm and taken priſoner. Ί he total loſs of
                    tlie allies in this affair was eſtimated at nearly one thouſand men. Tlie French
                    liad now muſtered in full force around Toulon, and prepared for tlie attack. It
                    was begun on tlie 19th of December in the morning, and was chiefly directed
                    againſt Fort Mulgrave, defended by the Britiſh. This fort was protected by an
                    entrenched camp, 13 pieces of cannon, 36 and 24 pounders, &amp;c. 5 mortars,
                    and 3000 troops. Such was the ardour of affault, that it was carried in an hour,
                    and the whole garriſon was deſtroyed or taken. The allies now found it
                    impoffible to defend the place ; and in the courſe of the day embarked tlieir
                    troops, after having ſet on ſire tlie arſenal and ſhips. A ſcene of confuiion
                    here enſued, ſuch as has not been known in the hiſtory of modern wars. Crowds of
                    people of every rank, age, and ſex, hurried on board the ſhips, to avoid the
                    vengeance of their enraged countrymen. Some of the inhabitants began to ſire
                    upon their late allies ; others in deſpair were ſeen plunging into the ſea,
                    making a vain effort to reach the ſhips ; or putting an end at once to their own
                    exiſtence upon the ſhore. Thirty-one ſhips of the line were ſound by the Britiſh
                    at Toulon; thirteen were left behind; ten were burnt; four had been previouſly
                    ſent to the French ports of Breſt and Rochefort, with 5000 republicans who could
                    not be truſted ; and Great Britain finally obtained by this expedition three
                    ſhips of the line and ſive fri-gates.</p>
                <p>On the ſide of Spain the war produced nothing of importance ; and in the
                    mountainous country of Piedmont it went on ſlowly. Nice and Chamberry were ſtili
                    retained by the French ; but more terrible ſcenes were acting in other quarters.
                    In La Vendee a moſt bloody war was perſiſted in by the royaliſts. In that
                    quarter of tlie country the language of the reff of France is little underſtood.
                    Tlie people were ſuperſtitious, and had acquired little idea of the new opinions
                    that had</p>
                <p>lately been propagated ln the reſt of the empire. They were chiefly headed by
                    prieſts, and regarded their cauſe as a religious one. Their mode of warfare
                    uſually was, to go on in their ordinary occupations as peaceable citizens, and
                    ſuddenly to aſſemble in immenſe bands, inſomuch that at one time they were ſaid
                    to amount to 150,000 men. They beſieged Nantz and the city of Orleans, and even
                    Paris itſelſ was not thought altoge-ther ſafe fiom their enterpriſes. The war
                    was inconceivably bloody. Neither party gave quarter ; and La Vendee proved a
                    dreadful drain to the population of France. On the 28th of June, the
                    conventional general Biron drove the royaliſts from Lucon ; and Nantz was
                    relieved by general Beyffer. After ſome ſucceſs, general Weſterman was ſurpriſed
                    by them, and compelled to retreat to Parthenay. In tlie beginning of Auguſt the
                    royaliſts were defeated by general Roffig-nol ; but on the 10th of that month,
                    under Charette their commander in chief, they again attacked Nantz, but ſuffered
                    a repulſe. It would be tedious to give a minute detail of this obſcure but cruel
                    war. The roy-aliſts were often defeated and ſeemingly diſperſed, but as often
                    aroſe in crowds around the aſtoniſhed re-publicans. At laſt, however, about the
                    middle of Oc-tober, they were completely defeated, driven from La Vendée, and
                    forced to divide into ſeparate bodies. One of theſe threw itſelf into the iſiand
                    of Noirmoutier, where they were ſubdued ; another took the road of Maine and
                    Brittany, where they ſtruggled for ſome time, againſt their enemies, and were at
                    'ſaſt cut to pieces or diſperſed.</p>
                <p>The royaliſts had long expected affiſtance from England; and an armament under
                    the earlof Moira was actual-ly fitted out for that ſervice, but it did not
                    arrive till too late, and returned home without attempting a landing. —The
                    Mountain party always diſgraced their ſucceffes by dreadful cruelties. Humanity
                    is ſhocked, and hiſto-ry would almoſt ceafe to obtain credit, were we to ſtate
                    in detail the unrelenting cruelties which were exerciſed againſt the unfortunate
                    royaliſts, chiefly by Carrier, a deputy from the convention, ſent into this
                    quarter with unlimited powers. Multitudes of priſoners were crowded on board
                    veffels in the Loire, aſter which the veffels were ſunk. No age nor ſex was
                    ſpared ; and thefe executions were performed with every circumſtance of wanton
                    barbarity and inſult.</p>
                <p>On the ſide of the Rhine a great variety of events occurred during the months of
                    Auguſt and September. Several engagements at ſirſt took place, in which the
                    French were, upon the whole, ſucceſsful. In Septem-ber, however, Landau was
                    inveſted by the combined powers ; and it was refolved to make every poffible
                    ef-ſmt to drive the French from the ſtrong lines of weiſ-ſembourg, on the river
                    Lauter. On the 13th of Oc-tober, the Auſtrian general wurmſer made a grand
                    attack upon thefe lines. ſ'he French fay that their generals betrayed them, and
                    ſuffered the lines to be taken almoſt without reſlſtance. The general of the
                    al-lies confeffed that the lines might have held out for ſeveral days. The
                    French retreated to Hagenau, from wliicli they were driven on tlie 18th ; and
                    ſuffered two other defeats on the 25th and 27th. Some of the principal citizens
                    of Straſhourg now fent a private deputa-tion to general wurmſer, offering to
                    ſurrender the town, to be preſerved as a depoſit to be reſtored to</p>

                <p>Louis XVII. General wurmſer reſuſed to accept of it upon theſe terms, inſiſting
                    upon an abfolute ſurren-der to his Imperial Majeſty. In conſequence oſ the delay
                    occaſioned by diſagreement, the negociation was diſcovered, and the citizens of
                    Straſhourg engaged in the plot wererſeized by St Juſt and Lebas, commiffion-ers
                    from the ^convention, and brought to the ſcaffold. Prodigious efforts were now
                    made by tbe French to recover their ground in this quarter. General Irem-bert
                    was ſhot at the head of the army on the 9th of November, upon a charge, probably
                    ill-founded, of treachery in the affair of the lines of weiſſembourg, On tlie
                    14th, however, Fort Louis was taken by tlie allies, not without ſuſpicion of
                    treachery in tlie governor. But here the ſucceſs of general wurmſer might be
                    ſaid to terminate. On tbe 2iſt tlie republican ar-my drove back tlie Auſtrians,
                    and penetrated almoſt to Hagenau. An army from tlie Moſelle now advanced to
                    co-operate with tlie army of tlie Rhine. On tlie 1 7th the Pruffians were
                    defeated near Sarhruck. Next day tlieir camp at Blieſcaſtel was ſtormed, and the
                    Frencli advanced to Deux Ponts. On the 29th and 30th tbe Frencli were repulſed
                    witli great loſs in two violent attacks made on the duke of Brtinſwick near
                    Lautern. But it now appeared that tlie French had come into tlie field witli a
                    determination to conquer whatever it might coſt. Every day was a day of battle,
                    and torrents of blood were ſhed on both ſides. The allies had the advantage of
                    poffeffing the ground, wliicli, in that quarter, at ſuch a late ſeafon of tlie
                    year, is very ſtrong on account of its inequalities and moraffes. In military
                    ſkill, the French officers and thoſe of the allies were perhaps nearly equal ;
                    but the French army was by ſar the moſt numerous ; and although not a match in
                    point of diſcipline, yet it derived no ſmall ſuperiority from the enthuſiaſm
                    with which the troops were animated. On the 8tli of December, under the command
                    of general Pichegru, the French carried the redoubts which covered Hagenau by
                    means of the bayonet.</p>
                <p>Tliis modern inſtrument of deſtruction, againſt whicli no deſenſive weapon is
                    employed, is always moſt ſucceſs-ful in the hands of the moſt intrepid ; and it
                    was now a dreadful engine in the hands of French enthuſiaſm.— The ſineſt troops
                    that ever Europe produced were unable to withſtand the fury of the republicans,
                    which ſeemed only to increaſe in proportion to the multitude of companions that
                    they loſt. On the 22d the allies were driven with immenſe ſiaugliter from
                    Hagenau, not-withſtanding tlie iinrnenſe works they liad thrown up for their
                    defence. The entrenchments on tlie heights of Reiſhoffen, Jauderſhoffen,
                    &amp;C. were conſidered as more impregnable than thoſe of Jemappe. They were
                    ſtormed by the army of the Moſelle and the Rhine, under generals Hoche and
                    Pichegru. On the 23d and 24th, die allies were purſued to the heights of wrotte.
                    On the 26th, the entrenchments there were forced by tlie bayonet, after a
                    deſperate conflict. O11 the 27th, the republican army arrived at weiffembourg in
                    tri-umph. General wurmſer retreated acroſs the Rhine, and the duke of Brunſwick
                    haſtily fell back to cover Mentz. The blockade of Landau, which had laſted four
                    months, was raiſed. Fort Louis was evsffcuated by the allies, and Kaiſerſſatern,
                    Germerſheim, and Spires, ſubmitted to the French.—During this laſt month of the
                    year 1793, the loſs of men on both ſideg</p>
                <p>in this quarter was immenſe, and unexampled in the hiſtory of modern war. It is
                    even ſaid that it might amount to more than 70,000 or 80,000 men.</p>
                <p>Thus far we have attended to the military affairs of the republic for ſome time
                    paſt. Very violent efforts were iu the mean time made at Paris by the new
                    admi-niſtration, eſtabliſhed under the auſpices of the Jacobin club, and of the
                    party called the <hi rend="italic">Mountain.</hi> The new republican
                    conſtitution had been preſented to the people in the primary affemblies, and
                    accepted. The buſmeſs, therefore, for which the convention was called toge-ther,
                    that of forming a conſtitution for France, was at an end ; and it was propoſed
                    that they ſhould diffolve themſelves, and order a new legiſſative body to
                    aſ-ſemble, according to the rules preſcribed by that con-ſtitution. This was, no
                    doubt, the regular mode of procedure ; but the ruling party conſidered it as
                    hazardous to convene a new aſſembly, poffeffing only limited powers, in the
                    preſent diſtracted ſtate of the country. It was indeed obvious, that France at
                    this time ſtood in need of a dictatorſhip, or of a government poffeffed of more
                    abſolute authority than can be enjoyed by one that acts, or even pretends to
                    act, upon the moderate principles of freedom. It was therefore determined that
                    the convention ſhould remain undiffolved till the end of the war ; and that a <hi rend="italic">revolutionary</hi> government, to be conducted by its
                    members, ſhould be eſtabliſhed, with uncontrouled powers. Committees of its own
                    body were ſelected for the purpoſe of conducting every department of buſineſs.
                    The chief of theſe committees was called the <hi rend="italic">committee of
                        public ſafety.</hi> It ſuper-intended all the reſt, and gave to the
                    adminiſtration of France all the ſecrecy and diſpatch which have been accounted
                    peculiar to a military government, together with a. combination of ſkill and
                    energy hitherto un-known among mankind. A correſpondence was kept up with all
                    the Jacobin clubs throughout tlie kingdom. Commiffioners from the convention
                    were ſent into all quarters, with unlimited authority over every order of
                    perſons. Thus a government poffeffed of infinite vigilance, and more abſolute
                    and tyrannical than that of any ſingle deſpot, was eſtabliſhed ; and tlie whole
                    tranſactions and reſources of the ſtate were known to the rulers. On the 23d of
                    Auguſt, Barrere, in name of the committee of public ſaſety, procured the
                    celebrated decree to be paffed for placing the whole French nation in a <hi
                        rend="italic"> fate of requiftion</hi> for the public ſervice. “ From this
                    moment (ſays the decree) till that when all enemies ſhall have been driven from
                    the territory of the republic, all Frenchmen ſhall be in perma-nent readineſs

                    married men ſhaſt forge arms, and tranſport the proviſions ; tlie women ſhall
                    make tents and clothes, and attend in tlie hoſpitals ; the children ſhall make

                <p>rannical than this was never made by an eaſtern deſpot ; and when it was ſirſt
                    publiſhed, foreigners were at a loſs whether to regard it as a ſublime effort of
                    a power-ful government, or as a wild project whicli could pro-duce nothing but
                    confuſion. The effects of it, how-ever, have been truly terrible, we have
                    already men-tioned ſome of them in the bloody conteſt wliicli oc-curred upon the
                    Rhine, and Europe was foon deſtined to bear witneſs to ſtill more extraordinary
                    events.</p>
                <p>In the end of July, general Cuſtine was brought to trial, and executed, in
                    conſequence of a variety of ac-cuſations of infidelity to his truſt and
                    diſreſpect to the convention. The queen was next brought to trial be-fore the
                    revolutionary tribunal, on the 15th of Octo-ber. Tlie charges againſt her were
                    very various ; but the chief tendency of them was to prove that ſhe had always
                    been hoſtile to the revolution, and liad excited all the efforts that had been
                    made by the court againſt it. On the 16th of October, this beautiful woman, whom
                    fortune once placed ſo high, ended her days on a ſcaffold, after a mock trial,
                    in which no regard was paid either to juſtice or decency. She behaved with much
                    dignity and compoſure, and appeared deeply impreſſed with a fenſe of religion.
                    The members of the <hi rend="sup">1</hi> convention who had been at the head
                    of the Girondiſt party, and had either been detained in priſon ſince the 3iſt of
                    May, or ſeized in the departments to which they had retired, were afterwards
                    brought to trial. On the 30th of October, 2 1 of them were executed, viz.
                    Briffot, Vergniaud, Genſonne, Duprat, Lehardi, D ucos, Fonfrede, Boileau,
                    Gardien, Duchatel, Sillery, Fauchet, Dufriche, Duperret, La Source, Carra,
                    Beau-vais, Mainville, Antiboul, Vigée, and Lacaze. Seventy-one were ſtill
                    detained in confinement. The duke of Orleans was afterwards condemned, on a
                    cliarge of having aſpired to the ſovereignty from the beginning of the
                    revolution. His execution gave ſatisfaction to all parties. His vote for the
                    puniſhment of death upon the trial of the late king had done him little honour
                    even in the opinion of the Mountain, and had rendered him odious to all the reſt
                    of mankind.</p>
                <p>The executions of perſons of all ranks, particularly of prieſts and nobles,
                    became now ſo common, that it would be in vain to attempt to give any detail of
                    them. Every perſon brought before the revolutionary tribunal was condemned as a
                    matter of courſe. The Jacobins ſeemed inſatiable in their thirſt after blood,
                    and the people at large appeared to regard their conduct with unaccountable
                    indifference.</p>
                <p>: when the human mind is once rouſed, its activity extends to every object. At
                    this time a new table of weights and meaſures was eſtabliſhed by the convention,
                    in which the decimal arithmetic alone is employed. The court of Spain had the
                    liberality, notwith-ſtanding the war, to ſuffer M. Mechain to proceed in his
                    operations for meaſuring a degree of the meridian in that country. He carried on
                    his ſeries of triangles from Barcelona to Perpignan ; and from this place the
                    menſuration was continued to Paris. M. de Lambre, and his pupil M. le Francois,
                    alſo meaſured a degree of latitude in the vicinity of the metropolis. In all, 12
                    degrees of the meridian were meaſured ; of which the mean is 57027 toifes, and
                    by this the univerſal ſtandard of meaſure is calculated. M. M. de Borde and
                    Caffini determined the length of a pendulum that ſwings ſe</p>

                    with the autumnal ‘equinox, and is divided into 12 months. Theſc are ‘called
                    Vindemaire, Brumaire, Frimaire, Nivos, Ventos, •Pluvios, Germinal, Frorial,
                    Praireal, Meffidor, Fervi-’dor, and Fructider. The months conſiſt of 30 days
                    each, and are divided into three decades. The days of oach decade are known by
                    the names of Primidi, Duo-"di, Tridi, &amp;c. to Decadi ; and the day of
                    reſt is ap-"pointed for every tenth day, inſtead of the ſeventh. The day (which
                    begins at midnight) is diſtributed into tell parts, and theſe are decimally
                    divided and ſubdivided. Five ſupernumerary days are added every year after the
                    30th of Fructidor. To theſe is given the ab-ſurd appellation of <hi
                        rend="italic"> Sans Cullottides,</hi> a word borrowed from a term of
                    reproach <hi rend="italic">(fans cullotte),</hi> which had often been beſtowed
                    on the republican party from the jneannefs of their rank and fortune ; but which
                    that party now attempted to render honourable and popular. The childiſh folly of
                    this innovation has ſtruck every perſon with ſurprize, as it can ſerve no good
                    purpoſe whatever. It is a wonderful inſtance of the way-wardneſs of the human
                    mind, which can occupy itſelf one moment with deeds of ſavage barbarity, and the
                    next with a matter ſo unimportant as the artificial diviſion of time.</p>
                <p>The religion of France had been gradually Iofing its influence ; and on the 7th
                    of November, Gobet biſhop of Paris, along with a great multitude of other
                    eccle-ſiaſtics, came into the hall of the convention, and ſolemn-ly refigned
                    their functions and renounced the Chriſtian religion. All the clergymen, whether
                    Proteſtant or Catholic, that were members of the convention, followed this
                    example, excepting only Gregoire, whom we formerly mentioned as having been one
                    of the firſt prieſts that joined the <hi rend="italic">Tiers Fiat</hi> after
                    the meeting of the States General. He had the courage to profefs himſelf a
                    Chriſtian, although he faid that the emoluments of his biſhoprſc were at the
                    ſervice of the republic, with the acclamations of the convention, it was decreed
                    that the only French deities hereafter ſhould be Liberty, Equality, Reaſon,
                    &amp;c. and they would ſeem to have conſecrated theſe as a kind of new
                    objects of worſhip.— what political purpofe the leaders in the convention
                    intended to ſerve by this proceeding does pot clearly ap-pear ; unlefs, perhaps,
                    their object was to render the French manners and modes of thinking ſo
                    completely new', that it ſhould never be in their power to return to the ſtate
                    from which they had juſt emerged, or to unite</p>
                <p>in intercourſe with the other nations of Europe. The populace, however, could
                    not at once relinquiſh en-tirely the religion of their fathers. The Commune oſ
                    Paris ordered the churches to be ſhut up, but the Convention found it neceſſary
                    to annul this order ; and Robefpierre gained no ſmali degree of popularity by
                    ſupporting the liberty of religious worſhip on this occaſion. Hebert and Fabre
                    d’Eglantine, who led the op-poſite party, haſtened their own fall by this
                    ill-judged contempt of popular opinion.</p>
                <p>For, now that the republic ſaw itſelf fuccefsful in all quarters, when the
                    Mountain party and the Jacobins had no rival at home, and accounted themſelves
                    in no immediate danger from abroad, they began to ſplit into factions, and the
                    fierceſt jealouſies aroſe. The Jacobin Club was the uſual place in which their
                    conteſts were carried 011 ; and at this time Robefpierre acted the part of a
                    mediator between all parties. Fie attempted with great art to turn their
                    attention from private animoſities to public affairs. He ſpread a report that an
                    invaſion of Great Britain was fpeedily to take place. He therefore propoſed that
                    the Jacobin Club ſhould ſet themſelves to work to diſeover the vulnerable parts
                    of the Brſtiſh conſtitutſon and government. They did ſo : They made ſpeeches,
                    and wrote eſſays without number. And in this way was the moſt fierce and
                    turbulent band of men that ever perhaps exiſted in any country occupied and
                    amuſed for a very conſiderable time, what is no leſs ſingular, a great number of
                    Britiſh ſubjects favoured the plans of theſe reforming Atheiſts, and, under the
                    fpecious appellation of the <hi rend="italic">Friends of the People,</hi> acted in concert with the French Jacobins.</p>
                <p>The winter paſſed away in tolerable quſetneſs, and no military enterpriſe was
                    undertaken either by the allies or by the French. On the iſt of February,
                    Barrere aſſerted in the Convention that the confederate powers were willing <hi
                        rend="italic"> provifionally</hi> to acknowledge the French republic, to
                    conſent to a ceſſation oi hoſtilities for two years, at the end of which a
                    laſting peace ſhould be ratified by the French people. But this propoſal the
                    Convention declared itſelf determined to reject, as affording to the other
                    nations of Europe the means of undermining their new government. In the mean
                    time, the revolutionary government was gradually becoming ' more vigorous.
                    Thirty committees of the Convention managed the whole buſineſs of the ſtate,
                    without ſha-ring^much of the direct executive government, which reſted in the
                    committee of public fafety. Theſe diffe-rent committees were engaged in the
                    utmoſt variety of objects. The ruling party had no competitors for power,
                    without confuſion or oppoſition, therefore, the moſt extenſive plans were
                    rapidly carried into effect. The Convention was little more than a court in
                    which</p>
                <p>every project was ſolemnly regiſtered. In the ſame ſeſ-iion 30 decrees would
                    ſometimes be paſſed upon objects the moſt widely different. The finances were
                    under one committee, at the head of which was Cambon.— This committee found
                    reſources for the moſt laviſh ex-penditure. The affignats were received as money
                    throughout the ſtate ; and thus a paper mill was ſaid to have become more
                    valuable than a mine of gold. Their credit was ſupported by an arbitrary law
                    regulating the <hi rend="italic">maximum</hi> or higheſt price of all
                    proviſions, and by the immenſe maſs of wealth which had come into the hands of
                    the Convention by ſeizing the church lands, and by confiſcating the property of
                    royaliſts, emigrants, and</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0194" facs="gri_33125011196389_0200.tif"/>
                <p>perfons condemned by the revolutionary tribunal. So unequally had property been
                    divided under the ancient government, that by means of theſe conſiſcations about
                    ſeven-tenths of the national territory was fuppoſed to be in the hands of the
                    public. To this was added the plunder of the churches, conſiſting of gold and
                    ſilvcr faints, and utenſils employed in divine worſhip, along wtth other
                    articles of ieſs value ; among which may be mentioned the innumerable church
                    bells, which were regarded as ſufficient for the manufacture of 15,000 pieces of
                    cannon. Theſe refources formed a mafs of property ſuch as never was poſſeſſed by
                    any government.</p>
                <p>Other committees were engaged in very different objects. Highways were
                    conſtructed, and canals planned and cut throughout the country. Immenſe
                    manufacto-ries of arms were everywhere eſtabliſhed. At Paris alone 1100 muſkets
                    were daily fabricated, and ioo pieces of cannon caſt every month. Public ſehools
                    were affiduouſly inſtituted, and the French language taught in its purity from
                    the Pyrenees to the Rhine. The French Convention poffeffed immenſe reſources,
                    and they did not heſitate to laviſh them upon their ſchemes. Every ſcience and
                    every art was called upon ſor aid, and the moſt accompliſhed men in every
                    profeffion were employed in giving ſplendour to their country. The chemiſts, in
                    particular, gave effential aid by the facility with wliicli they ſupplied
                    materials for the manufacture of gun-powder ; and in return for their ſervices,
                    Lavoiſier, the greateſt of them, ſuffered death by a moſt iniquitous ſentence.
                    Not fewer than 200 new dramatic performances were produced in leſs than two
                    years ; the object of which was to attach the people to the preſent order of
                    things. The vigour with which the committees of ſubſiſtence exerted themſelves
                    is particularly to be remarked. As all Europe was at war with France, and as
                    England, Holland, and Spain, the three maritime powers, were engaged in the
                    conteſt, it had been thought not impoffible to reduce France to great diſtreſs
                    by famine, eſpecially as it was imagined that the country had not reſources to
                    ſupply its immenſe population. But the preſent leaders of that country acted
                    with the policy of a beſteged garriſon. They ſeized upon the whole proviſions in
                    the country, and carried them to public granaries. They regiſtered the cattle,
                    and made their owners reſponſible for them.— They provided tlie armies
                    abundantly, and, as the people were accurately numbered, they dealt out in every
                    diſtrict, on ſtated occaſtons, what was abfolutely neceffary ſor ſubſiſtence,
                    and no more. To ali this the peo-ple ſubmitted <hi rend="italic">y</hi> and
                    indeed, throughout the whole of the mixed ſcenes of this revolution, the calm
                    judgment of the hiſtorian is not a little perplexed. WC cannot avoid admiring
                    the patience with which the people at Iarge endured every hardſhſp that was
                    repreſented as weceſſary to the common cauſe, and the enthuſiaſtic energy with
                    which they laviſhed their blood in defence of the independence oſ their country.
                    At the ſame time, we muſt regard with indignation a»d diſguſt the worthlefs
                    intrigues by means of which the ſanguinary factions in the Convention and the
                    capital alternately maffacred each other.</p>
                <p>During the winter the diſſenſions of the Jacobins ftill increaſed. They were
                    divided into two clubs, of which the new one aſſembled at a hall whieh once
                    belonged to the Cordeliers- The leaders of it were He-</p>
                <p>bert, Ronſin, Vhtcent, and others ; but the old .ſociety retained its
                    aſcendency, and Robefpierre was now &lt;Je-cidedly its leader. This
                    extraordinary man had grada-ally accumulated in his own perſon the conſidence of
                    the people and the direction of the government. As the committees were above the
                    Convention, which was become little more than a ſilent court of record, ſo the
                    committee of public ſaſety was above the other commit-tees. Robefpierre was the
                    leader of this ruling com. mſttee. Barrere, St Juſt, Couthon, and others of its
                    members, only acted a ſecondary part. They laboured in the buſinefs of the
                    ſtate, but the radical power was with Robefpierre. He ſurrounded the members of
                    the Convention with ſpies. He was jealous and implacable, and ſet no bounds to
                    the ſhedding of blood. On the 25th of March he brought to trial the following
                    active Jacobins, who were condemned and executed on the following day : Hebert,
                    Ronſin, Momoro, Vincent, Du Croquet, Kocq, Col. Laumur, M. M. Bourgeois, Mazuel,
                    La Boureau, Ancard, Le Clerc, Proly, Deſ-ſieux, Anacharſis Cloots, Pereira,
                    Florent Armand, Deſcombes, and Dcbuiſon. Not ſatisſied with this, on the 2d of
                    April he brought to trial nine of thoſe who had once been his moſt vigorous
                    aſſociates, Danton* Fabre d’Eglantine, Bazire, Chabot, Philippeaux, Camille
                    D'eſmoulins, Lacroix, Delaunay d’Angers, He-rault de Sechelles, who, along with
                    weſterqian, were executed on the evening of the 5th.</p>
                <p>Still, however, the preparations for the enſuing campaign were proceeding with
                    unabated vigour. 'The committee for military affairs, at the head of which were
                    Carnot, La Fitte, d’Aniffi, and others, was bufy in arranging along the
                    frontiers the immenſe force which the requiſitſon had called forth. Plans of
                    attack and defence were made out by this committee; and when approved by the
                    committee of public ſafety they were fent to the generals to be executed. On the
                    other ſide, the allies were making powerful preparations for another attempt to
                    ſubjugate France. The Emperor himſelf took the held at the head of the armies in
                    the Nether-lands. The plan of the campaign is ſaid to have been, formed by the
                    Auſtrias Colonel Mack, weſt Flanders was to be protected by a ſtrong body of men
                    ; the main army was to penetrate to Landrecies, and getting within the line of
                    French frontier towns, it was to cut them off from the interior by covering the
                    country from Maubeuge to the ſea. The plan was <hi rend="italic">bold.</hi> It
                    belongs to military men to judge whether this was not its only merit, when
                    attempting to put it in execution, the allies muſt have been ill informed of the
                    immenſe force which the French were collecting againſt therm Even the town of
                    Liſſe alone, which is capable of containing a numerous army within its walls,
                    and which was to be left in their rear, ſhould have ſeerned an inſurmountable
                    objection to the plan.</p>
                <p>On the 16th of April the Auſtrian, Britiſh, and Dutch armies affembled on the
                    heights above Cateau, and were reviewed by the emperor. On the following day
                    they advanced in eight columne againſt the French, drove in tlieir whole poſts,
                    and* penetrated beyond Lan-drecies which place the French attempted to. relieve,
                    but without ſuccefs. The allied army now amounted to 187,000 men, who were
                    diſpoſed in the following manner; 15,000 Dutch and <hi rend="italic">15,000</hi> Auſtrians, under the prince of Orange and general. Latour, formed the</p>

                <p>ſtegc of L andre cies; 15,000 Britiſh and 15,000 Auſtri-ans, commanded by the
                    duke of York and general Otto, encamped towards Cambray. The emperor and the
                    prince of Saxe-Cobourg, at the head of 60,000 Auf-trians, were advanced as ſar
                    as Guiſe ; 12,000 Heffi-ans and Auſtrians under general worms were ſtationed
                    near Douay and Bouchain ; Count Kaunitz with 15,000 Auſtrians defended the
                    Sambre and the quarter near Maubeuge ; and, laſtly, general Clairfait, with
                    40,000 Auſtrians and Hanoverians, protected Flanders from Tournay to the ſea ;
                    60,000 Pruffians, for whom a ſubſidy had been paid by Great Britain, were
                    expect-ed in addition to thefe, but they never arrived.</p>
                <p>The French now commenced their active operations. On the morning of the 26th of
                    April they attacked the duke of York near Cateau in great force. After a ſevere
                    conflict they were repulſed, and their general Chapuy was taken priſoner. At the
                    ſame time they attacked the troops under his Imperial majeſty, but were there
                    alſo repulſed in a ſimilar manner; loſing in all 57 pieces of cannon. On the
                    ſame day, however, general Pichegru advanced from Liſſe, attacked and defeated
                    general Clairfait, took 32 pieces of cannon; and, in the conrſe of a few days,
                    made himſelf maſter of Warwick, Menin, and Courtray, On the 29th of April, the
                    garrifon of Landrecies ſurrendered to the allies. when this event was known in
                    the convention,</p>
                <p>. it excited a conſiderable degree of alarm. It was, however, the laſt effectual
                    piece of ſucceſs enjoyed by the allies during this diſaſtrous campaign. General
                    Clairfait was again completely defeated by Pichegru in a general engagement ;
                    and it was found neceffary to ſend the duke of York to his affiſtance. This
                    move-ment was no doubt unavoidable ; but the effect of it was, that it ſplit
                    down tlie allied army into a variety of portions, capable of carrying on a
                    defultory war-fare, but unfit ſor the vigorous objects of conqueſt. On tlie 10th
                    the duke of York was attacked near Tournay by a body of tlie enemy, whom he
                    repulſed ; but he was unable to join Clairfaſt, upon whoſe de-ſtruction the
                    French were chiefly bent : for at the ſame time that the duke of York was
                    occupied by the attack upon himſeff, Pichegru fell upon Clairfait with filch
                    irreſiſtible impetuoſity, that he was compelled to retreat in confuſion, and a
                    part of his army appears to have fled to the neighbourhood of Bruges, while
                    Pichegru was thus advancing ſucceſsſully in weſt Flan-dere, general jourdan
                    advanced in Eaſt Elanders from Maubeuge, croſſed the Sambre, and forced general
                    Kaunitz to retreat. On the 18th, however, general Kaunitz ſucceedfed in
                    repuiſing the enemy in his turn, and they re-croſſed the Sambre with
                    conſiderable loſs.</p>
                <p>The allies now found that no progreſs could be made in France while general
                    Pichegru was advancing ſuccefs-fully and occupying weft Flanders in their rear.
                    The emperor, therefore, withdrew the greater part of his army to the
                    neighbourhood of Tournay, and reſolved to make a grand effort to cut oſſ the
                    communication between Courtray and Liſle, thus to prevent complete-ly the
                    retreat of Pichegru. On the night of the 16th, the army moved forwards in five
                    columns for this purpoſe. Clairfait was at the ſame time directed, to crofs the
                    Lys, to effect a general junction, if poffible, and complete the plan. The
                    attempt during that evening Äeemed to promiſe ſucceſs ; but, in the courſe of
                    ncxt</p>
                <p>day, the diviſion under the duke of York was Over-powered by numbers and
                    defeated. The progreſs of the reſt of the columns was ſtopped, and Clairfaſt
                    completely defeated. In the confuſion of the day, when attempting to rally the
                    different parts of the di-viſion which he commanded, the duke of York was
                    ſeparated from his own troops by a party of the enemy’s cavalry, and only
                    eſcaped being made priſoner by the ſwiftnefs of his horſe. The plan of the
                    allies being thus fruſtrated, their army withdrew to the neighbour« hood of
                    Tournay.</p>
                <p>Pichegru ſpeedily attempted to retaliate againſt the allies. On the 22d of May
                    he brought down at day break his whole force againſt them. The attack was
                    commenced by a heavy ſire of artillery, and all the ad-vanced poſts were forced.
                    The engagement ſoon became general; the attacks were repeatedly renewed on both
                    ſides ; the whole day was ſpent in a ſucceſ-ſion of obſtinate battles. All that
                    military /kill could do was performed on both ſides. The French and the allied
                    ſoldiers fought with equal courage and equal diſcipline. At nine o’clock in tlie
                    evening the French at laſt reluctantly withdrew from the attack.</p>
                <p>Ί he day on which a vanquiſhed enemy flies from the field is not âlways that on
                    which the victory is won. In this engagement the French were unſucceſsſul in
                    their immediate objects; but the weight of their ſire, their ſteady difcipline,
                    and their violent obſtinacy of attack, raiſed their military character high in
                    the eſti-mation of the officers and ſoldiers of the allied army. It was ſoon
                    perceived, that in addition to theſe they poſſeſſed other advantages. Their
                    numbers were im-menſe ; they implicitly obeyed their generals ; who,</p>
                <p>being men newly raiſed from the rank of ſubalterns, as implicitly ſubmitted to
                    the directions of the com-mitte of public ſafety. A combination of efforts was
                    thus produced whoſe operation vvas not retarded by divided counſels. On the
                    other ſide, the numbers of the allies were daily declining ; them leaders were
                    independent princes or powerful men, whoſe ſentiments and intereſts were often
                    very hoſtile to each other, and their exertions were conſequently diſunited.</p>
                <p>Ou the 24th the French again croſſed the Sambre, but were driven back with much
                    loſs. On the 27th an attempt was made to beſiege Charleroi, but the prince of
                    Orange on the 3d of June compelled them to raiſe the liege. On the 12th a
                    ſimilar attempt was made, and they were again repulſed. In weft Flanders,
                    however, Pichegru was ſufficiently ſlrong to com* mence the liege of Ypres. He
                    was ſoon attacked by general Clairfait for the purpoſe of relieving it, but
                    without ſucceſs.—Ypres was garrifoned by 7000 men ; reinforcements were
                    therefore daily ſent from the grand army to Clairfait for the purpoſe of
                    relieving it. It is unneceſſary to, mention the bloody conteſts ſu which that
                    unfortunate general was daily engaged with the French ; it is fufficient to ſay,
                    that they were uni-forraly unſucceſsful, and were the means of wafting, in a
                    great degree, the armies of the allies. Ypres held out till the 17th of June,
                    when it capitulated: and ſuch was the difcipline of the French army at this
                    time, that no notice could be obtained, for ſeveral days, of that event. In
                    conſequence of it and of other events, the duke of York found it neceffary to
                    retreat to Oude-narde j for Jourdan, after ftorming the Auſtrian camp</p>

                <p>cſ Betignies, now advanced with fnch ſtrength upon ’ Charleroi in the eaſt that
                    its immediate ſali was fear-ed. As this would have enabled the two French
                    ar-mies to encircle the whole of Flanders, the prince of Cobourg advanced to its
                    relief. Charleroi furrendered at diſcretion on the 25th. This circumſtance was
                    not known by the prince of Cobourg when he advanced on the 26th to. attack in
                    their entrenchments the army that covered the ſiege near Fleürus : but the
                    covering army being by this time reinforced by the acceffion of the beſieging
                    army, the aliies were repulſed. Jourdan then drew llis men out of their
                    entrenchments ; and, in his turn, attacked the Auſtrians. Fie was three times
                    re-pulſed, but was at laſt ſucceſaſul : the hffs of the van· quiſhed army is
                    ſaid to have been prodigious ; but no regular accounts of it have been
                    publiſhed. The French unqueſtionably exaggerated their own ſucceſs, when they
                    ſaid that it amounted to 15,000 men.</p>
                <p>The allies now retreated in ali quarters. Nieuport, Oſtend, and Bruges, were
                    taken ; and Tournay, Mons, Oudenarde, and Bruſſels, opened their gates. At this
                    .laſt place tlie French armies of Eaſt and weſt Flan-ders united. Landrecies,
                    Valenciennes, Condé, and Queſnoy, were fruitleisly left with garriſons in them.
                    The allied troops, evacuating Namur, formed a line from Antwerp to Liege to
                    protect the country behind. The French advanced in full force, and attacked
                    ge-neral Clairfait, cut to pieces half the troops that now remained under him,
                    and broke the line. The ah lies retreated before them. The dtike of York was
                    joined' by ſome troops under the earl of Moira that with much , difficulty had
                    made their way to him from Oſtend ; and with thefe and the Dutch troops he
                    retired to the neighbourhood of Bergen-op-zoom and- Breda for the protection of
                    Holland. The prince of Cobourg eva-cuated Liege, croſſed the Mæfe, and placed a
                    garri-ſon in Maeſtricht. He ſoon, however, ſent back a part of his troops to the
                    neighbourhood of Tongres ; for here, to the aſtoniſhment of all Europe, the
                    French armies made a voluntary pauſe in their career of vic-tory, and ceaſed to
                    purſue their retiring foes. Sluys in Dutch Flanders was the only foreign poſt
                    that they continued to attack, and it ſurrendered after a ſiege of 21 days.</p>
                <p>On the Rhine the war was equally ſuccefsful on the part bf the French. On the
                    lzth, 13th, and 14th of July, repeated engagements were fought ; in which the
                    French enjoyed their uſual ſucceſs. They had nume-rous armies in every quarter..
                    Their mode of fighting was to make full preparation for aecompliſhing their
                    object, and to fight in great bodiea day after day till it was obtained. The
                    Palatinate was thus over-run, and Treves taken, by general Michaud. Flanders and
                    the Palatinate have always been accounted the. granaries of Germany ; and both
                    of them, at the commencement of the harveſt, now fell into the hands of the
                    French.</p>
                <p>During the courſe of this ſummer Corſica was ſub-dued by Great Britain and the
                    whole of the French weſt India Iſſands, excepting a part of Gaadaulope, yielded
                    to the Britiſh troops under the command oſ Sir Charles Grey and Sir John Jarvis.
                    On the firſt oſ June the Britiſh fleet, under the command oſ earl Howe, gained a
                    moſt ſplendid victory over the French fleet to the weſtward of Uſhant. The
                    French committee of ſaſety were known to have puchaſed in America im</p>
                <p>menſe quantities of grain and other ſtores. Thefe were embarked on board 160
                    fail of merchantmen, convoyed by ſix ſail oſ the line.. Lord Howe failed to
                    intercept this valuable convoy. The French fleet failed at the fame time to
                    protect it... On the morning oſ the 28th oſ May the fleets came in ſight of each
                    other. The Britiſh admiral had previouſſy diſpatched ſſx ſhips of the line under
                    admiral Montague to intercept the French convoy, while he ſhould engage and
                    detain the grand fleet, 'ſ'he French diſpatched eight, ſail to defeat this
                    attempt.. In the courſe oſ the 29th Lord Howe got to windward of the French
                    fleet. His force was 25, and theirs was 2-6, ſail oſ the line. The following day
                    he bore dôwn upon them, and broke their line. Tlie engagement was one oſ the
                    ſevereſt' ever fought., Tlie French admiral, in leſs than an hour aſter the
                    cloſe action commenced in the centre, crouded off with 12 oſ his ſhips.. The
                    Britiſh fleet was ſo much diſabled, or ſeparated, that ſeveral oſ the French
                    diſ-rnantled ſhips got away under fails raiſed on the ſtump, oſ their
                    ſore-maſts. Seven ſail oſ the line, however, re-mained in poſſeffion· oſ the
                    Britiſh, and two were un-queſtionably ſunk.. In the mean time, admiral Mon-.
                    tague ſell in with the French convoy, but it- was now guarded by 14 ſail oſ the
                    line. Äs he could not encounter ſuch a force, he returned home, and it was
                    ſafe»-ly conveyed into port; Thus, by one oſ thoſc contradictions which ſo often
                    occur in human affairs, the Britiſh fleet was victorious, and the French were
                    leſt in ſome meaſure mailers oſ the ſea. As this engagement however teſtiſied
                    that tlre Britiſh ſeamen had not loſt, their ancient ſuperiority on their own
                    element, the nation regarded the preſent victory as a pledge oſ its
                    independence, and very general rejoicings took place in conſequence of it.</p>
                <p>In the mean time, the revolutionary ſyſtem of go-vernment in the hands of
                    committees of the convention at Paris, and. of committees of the- popular
                    ſocieties throughout the country, was arrived at its higheſt perfection, and
                    proceeded without oppoſition in its ſevere and ſanguinary meaſures-</p>
                <p>On .the 10th of May Madame Elizabeth, ſiſter of the late king, was ſacriſiced by
                    it in conſequence of a decree of the revolutionary tribunal. Multitudes of
                    others of every rank and ſex were daily ſacrificed in a ſimſſar manner; the rich
                    in particular were the great, objects of perſecution, becauſe the confifcation
                    of their property added to the ſtrength of the ruling powers. But neither were
                    the poor ſafe from the bloody vigilance of this new and ſingular government. By
                    the different executions Robefpierre had contrived to deſtroy every avowed
                    rival. All the conſtituted authorities conſiſted wholly of perſons nominated
                    with his approbation ; and as the committees which conducted the buſineſs of the
                    ſtate were at his diſpoſal, his will was irreſiſtible throughout the republic.
                    He met witli no oppoſition in th’e conventien ; ſor that body was no longer the
                    turbulent popular aſſembly which it had once appeared ; it was little more than
                    a name employed to give ſome fort of reſpectability to ſuch ſchemes as were
                    propoſed to it.</p>
                <p>Amidſt this accumulation, however, of ſecmingly ir-reſiſtible authority,
                    Robefpierre was at the brink of ruin. The whole of the old Girondiſt party was
                    indeed ſubdued and ſilent ; but many members of the convention ſtill remained
                    attached to it. The party of the</p>

                <p>Mountain, by means of whom Robefpierre had riſen to power, with little
                    ſatisſaction now found themſelves not only difregarded, ſhut ready at every
                    inſtant to fall a ſacrifice to that ſyſtem oſ terror which they had contributed
                    to erect. Even the Jacobins ſhemſelves, though neither timid nor cautious in the
                    ſhedding of blood, be-gan to murmur when they ſaw that awful privilege confined
                    excluſively within a few hands, or rather monopolized by an individual. In this,
                    ſtate things remained for ſome time;, and it appeared how poffible it is for an
                    individual to govern a great nation even while the whole of that nation is
                    hoſtile to his power. The baniſhment or imprifonment of all foreigners, which
                    had long been rigorouſſy practiſed, prevents us from poffeffing much accurate
                    information concerning the internal ſtate of France at this period ; but it is
                    certain, that one eircumftance in particular tendëd much to accelerate the fall
                    of Robefpierre.. He had procured a decree to be paffed, authoriſing the
                    committee of public ſafety to impriſon at its pleaſure, and bring to trial, any
                    member oſ the convention. All the individuals of that body found themſelves
                    placed by this decree in the hands oſ a man wlioſe ſevere and ſuſpicious temper
                    they well knew. Still, however, they were ſo much ſurrounded’by ſpies, that it
                    was difficult to form a party or plan oſ operations ; even the majority oſ the
                    committee of public ſaſety were among the number oſ the diſcontented, but they
                    dared not to withſtand their chief.. At laſt, on the 25th of July, the
                    convention began to exhibit ſigns of agita-tion.. It was underſtood, that in the
                    conrſe oſ a few day# Robefpierre would ſacriſice a number oſ the mem-bers to his
                    ſuſpicions. On the following day the ſitting of the convention was ſtill more
                    tempeſtuous. In a. long ſpeech Robefpierre defended his own conduct againſt
                    thoſe who had reproached him with aſpiring to the dic-tatorfllip of France. He
                    attacked the party whom he ſtyled <hi rend="italic">Moderates,</hi> as.
                    wiſhing ,to overturn the revolutionary government^ and to reſtore the feeble
                    ſyſtem of the Briffotinesi The reſult of a long debate was, that Ro-beſpierre
                    was apparently victorious, and his ſpeech was-ordered to be printed. On the 27th
                    the convention, appeared ripe for a change : St Juſt, a member of the committee
                    of public ſafety, in attempting to defend Robefpierre,. was repeatedly
                    interrupted; and Billaud Varrennes ſtood forward and enumerated the crimes, and
                    proclaimed the tyranny, of Robefpierre. The ſpeech was received with burſts of
                    applauſe. Robe-ſpierre in vain attempted to defend himſelf ; he was filenced by
                    ſhouts of execration from every part of the hall. Tallien ſeconded the former
                    ſpeaker in . his ac-cuſation. The ſitting was declared permanent, and a decree
                    of arreſt was paffed againſt Robefpierre and a younger brother of his, along
                    with St Juſt, Couthon, and Lebas. Theſe men left the convention, and found?
                    ſecurity in the hall of the commune of Paris ; where the municipal officers
                    agreed to protect and ſtand by them. The tocſin was founded ; the armed force
                    was under their command ; an infurrection was therefore attempted againſt the
                    convention : but the ſections of Paris reſuſed their ſupport. Very few ef the
                    troops· could be collected^ and thefe were, not ſirm ; the late tyranny had
                    become odious. The hall of the commune was thereforeſpeedilyſurrounded; and
                    about three o’clock in the morning of the 28th Robefpierre and his affoci</p>
                <p>ates were made priſoners.« They had been· outlawed</p>
                <p>by the convention on account of their reſlſtance. They were not therefore tried,
                    unleft for the purpoſe of identifying their perſons ; and, in the courſe of that
                    day, they were executed : 60 of the municipal officers were alſo executed <hi
                        rend="italic"> for</hi> joining in their rebellion ; and in this way a
                    ſtorm paſſed over, which at one time threatened to involve the French capital in
                    ruin, and ſilled all Eu-rope with aſtoniſhment. Thus alſo terminated the career
                    of the moſt extraordinary man that the French revolution had brought forward.
                    His talents were undoubtedly confide rable, and his ambition knew no bounds^
                    bidding defiance to the ordinary feelings of humanity. Had Dumourier poſſeſſed
                    his eoolneis and caution, or had lie poſſeffed the military talents of
                    Dumourier, the convention would certainly have been overturned, and we ſhoul'd
                    have ſeen a ſecond Cromwell on tile throne of his murdered ſovereign.</p>
                <p>After the fall of Robeſpierre, the convention exhi-bited no ſmall change of
                    appearance. Inſtead of that ſilence which formerly prevailed, all was buſtle and
                    noiſe all accuſed each other. There was no longer any leader, and there was no
                    formed party. Ί he foimer ſyſtem of terror was declared to be at an end, and a
                    new ſyſtem of <hi rend="italic">moderatiſm</hi> ſucceeded. This was carried to
                    as great a height as tile fyſtem of terror had formerly been ; and all means
                    were taken to render popular the fall of their late tyrant. The committees were
                    or- ■ ganiſed anew, and their members ordered to be frequently changed. The
                    correſpondence between the affiliated Jacobin clubs was prohibited, and at laſt
                    the Jacobin club itſelf was aboliſhed. This laſt event was accompliſhed with
                    eaſe ; and that ſociety which had been the great engine of the revolution, was
                    itſelf without reſiſtance overturned. Seventy-one deputies of the Girondiſt
                    party, who had been imprifoned ſince the 31ft of May 1793, were ſet at liberty.
                    The name of Lyons was reſtored to it. Some of the agents of Robeſpierre were
                    puniſhed, particularly the infamous Carrier, whoſe cruelties in La Vendee we
                    formerly mentioned. Still, however, the convention appeared ſo little united and
                    fo little decided with regard to objects of the ſirſt im~ portance, that in all
                    probability they would not have conducted tlie important ſtruggle againſt the
                    nations of Europe witli more ſucceſs than the Girondiſt party had formerly done,
                    if the revolutionary government and the late fyſtem of terror had not already
                    accumulated in their hands ſuch vaſt reſources, and traced out ſuch a plan of
                    procedure, as rendered it an eaſy matter to preſerve their numerous armies in
                    the train of ſuc~ ceſs to which they were now habituated, -</p>
                <p>The allies in their retreat had left, ſtrang .garriſons in the French towns
                    which had ſurrendered to them. Theſe were.Condé, Valenciennes, Queſnoi, and
                    Lan-drecies. They now ſurrendered. to the republican ar-mies with ſo little
                    reſiſtance, tliat the conduct of the emperor began to be-conſidered as
                    ambiguous, and· he was ſuſpected of having entered · into ſome kind of
                    com-promiſe with the French. This idea proved erroneous; and as ſuon as the army
                    which had beſieged theſe towns was able to join the grand army under Pichegru
                    ancl Jourdan, the. operations oſ the campaign were reſumed aſter a ſuſpenſion of
                    almoſt two months. The French army divided itſelſ into two bodies. One oſ theſe
                    un-» der Jourdan advanced againſt General Clairſait, who-had ſucceeded the
                    prince of Cobourg in the command</p>

                <p>in the neighbourhood of Maeſtricht. On the 15th of September the French attacked
                    the whole Auſtrian poſts in a.k extent of ſive leagues from Liege to Mae*
                    ſtricht. On that and the following day the loſſes were nearly equal. On the 17th
                    the French with 50 pieces of cannon attacked General Kray in his entrenched camp
                    before Maeſtrſcht. M. de Kray was already re-tiring when General Clairfait
                    arrived with a ſtrong <hi rend="italic">re-</hi> inforcement, and after a
                    ſevere combat the French were once more compelled to retire. On the 18th the
                    French renewed the attack with tenfold fury upon every part of the Auſtrian
                    line, and the whole was compelled to fly to the neighbourhood of
                    Aix-la-Cha-pelle. General Clairſait now choſe a ſtrong pofition on the banks <hi
                        rend="italic"> of</hi> the Roer, where he even declared it to be his wiſh
                    that he might be attacked. But by this time the ſpirit of his army was humbled,
                    deſertions became numerous, and the want of diſcipline was extreme. On tlie iſt
                    of October the French croſſed the Maeſe and the Roer, and attacked the whole
                    Auſtrian poſts from Ruremond down to Juliers. After a bloody engagement, the
                    brave and active, though unfortunate, General Clairfait was compelled haſtily to
                    croſs the Rhine, with the lofs of 10 or 1 2,000 men. The French general did not
                    attempt to croſs that river, but one detachment of his army took poſſeſſion of
                    Coblentz, while others laid cloſe ſiege to Venlo and Maeſtricht, which ſoon
                    ſurrendered.</p>
                <p>The diviſion of the French army, in the mean time, under General Pichegru came
                    down upon Holland, and attacked the allied army under the duke of York between
                    Bois-leduc and Grave. They forced the advanced poſt of Boxtel.
                    Lieutenant-general Abercromby was ſent to attempt to recover this poſt on the
                    15th of September, but he found the French in ſuch force that he was obliged to
                    retreat. Indeed tlie French were difcovered to be no lefs than 80,000 ſtrong in
                    that neighbourhood. The duke of York was unable to contend againſt a for-ce ſo
                    ſuperior, and retired acroſs the Maeſe with the loſs of fomewhat leſs than 1500
                    men. Pichegru immediately laid ſiege to Bois-le-duc. On the 30th of September,
                    Crevecœur was taken, and bois-leduc ſurrendered in 10 days thereafter. In it 408
                    French emigrants were taken griſoners ; and theſe, as well as 700 that had been
                    taken at Nieuportf 500 at Sluys, and ι ico at Valenciennes, were all put to
                    death, agreeably tt&gt; the rigorous law formerly made by the convention.
                    The French now followed the duke of York acroſs the Maeſe. Lſpon this the
                    greater part of the allied army under his royal highneſs croſſed the Rhine and
                    took poſt at Arnheim. The remaining part of the army ſol-lewed ſoon after, and
                    Nimeguen was occupied by the French on the 7th of November. The duke of
                    Brunfwick was at this time requeſted to take the command of the allied army, to
                    protect Holland, if poffible. He came to Arnheim forthat purpofe; but after
                    examining the ſtate of things there, he declined the undertaking. The allied
                    troops had now ſo often fled before their victorious and almoſt innumerable
                    enemies, they had ſo often been in want of every neceſſary, and had been
                    received ſo ill by the inhabitants of the countries through which they paſſed,
                    among whom the French cauſe was extremely popular, that they had loſt that
                    regularity of conduct and diſcipline which alone can afford a ſecure proſpect ef
                    Iucceſa in military affaira.</p>
                <p>The French, on the contrary, well received, nbmſhdlng in every thing, and proud
                    of fighting in a popular cauſe, now acted with much order, and ſubmitted to the
                    ſtricteſt diſeipline. ln addition to all tlieſe advantages, the French leaders
                    had the dexterity to pejſuade the world that new and unknown arts were employed
                    to give aid to their cauſe. At this period the <hi rend="italic">télégraphe</hi> was ſirſt uſed ſor conveying intelligence from the frontiers to the
                    capital, and from tlie capital to the frontiers. (See Télégraphe). Balloons were
                    alſo uſed by the French during this campaign to procure knowledge of the
                    po-ſition of the enemy. A11 engineer afcended with the balloon, which was
                    ſuffered to riſe to a great height, but prevented from flying away by a long
                    cord. He made plans of the enemies encampment ; and during an attack he ſent
                    down notice of every hoſtile move-ment. In the affairs of men, and more
                    eſpecially in military tranfactions, opinion is of more importance than reality.
                    The French ſoldiers confided in their own officers as men poſſeſſed of a kind of
                    omniſeience, while the allied troops, no doubt, beheld with anxiety a new
                    contrivance employed againſt them, whoſe import-ance would be readily magnified
                    by credulity and ignorance. with all theſe advantages, however, after the
                    capture of Nimeguen, they once more made a halt in their carrier, and abſtained
                    from the attack of Holland, which now ſeemed almoſt proſtrate before them.</p>
                <p>while theſe events occurred in the north, the French arms were fcarcely leſs
                    ſucceſsful on the ſide ef Spain. Bellegarde was taken ; in the weſtern Pyrenees,
                    Fon-tarabia ſurrendered, and alſo St Sebaſtian ; the whole kingdom of Spain
                    ſeemed panic ſtruck. That feeble government, with an almoſt impregnable
                    frontier, and the moſt powerful fortreſſes, could make little reſiſtance ; and
                    the difficult nature of their country was their only protection. The hiſtory of
                    this war is only a hiſtory of victories on the part of the French. In the
                    Eaſtern Pyrenees, on the 17th of November, the French <hi rend="italic">general</hi> Dugommier was killed in an engagement, in which his army was ſucceſsful.
                    On the 20th of that month the French again attacked the Spaniards, and routed
                    them by meansof the bayonet, without firing a ſingle muſket-ſhot. Tents,
                    baggage, and cannon, for an ar-my of 50,000 men, fell into the hand of the
                    conquerors, along with a great part of the province of Navarre. Towards the end
                    of the year, an army of 40,000 Spa-niards, entrenched behind 80 redoubts, the
                    labour of ſix monthe, ſuffered themſelves to be completely routed ; their
                    general count de La Union was found dead on the field of battle, and the whole
                    Spaniſh artillery was taken. In three days thereafter, the ſort Fernando de
                    Figuieres, containing a garriſon of 9107 men, ſurrendered, although it mounted
                    171 pieces of cannon, and poſſeſſed abundance of proviſions. The French
                    continued their conqueſts ; Rofas was taken, and the whole province of Catalonia
                    was left at the mercy of the invaders.</p>
                <p>The ſuccefſes of this wonderful campaign were not yet terminated ; and the laſt
                    part of them is perhaps the moſt important, although no great effort was
                    neceffary to its execution. The winter now ſet in with uncom-mon ſeverity. For
                    ſome years paſt the ſeaſons of Eu« rope had been uncommonly mild ; there had
                    been lit-tle froſt in winter, and no intenfe heat in ſummer. But during the late

                <p>marlcabfy dry till the latter part oſ harveſt, when there fell a conſiderable,
                    though by no means unuſual, quan-tity of rain. Towards the end of December a
                    ſevere froſt bound up the whole of the rivers and lakes of Holland. The waal was
                    frozen over in the beginning of January; a circumſtance which had not occurred
                    for 14 years paſt. Taking advantage ef this, the French croſſed that river, and
                    with little oppoſition ſeized the important pafs of Bommell, which at other
                    ſcafons is ſo ſtrong by its inundations. The allied army had been joined by
                    17,000 Auſtrians, and had received ordcrs to defend Holland to the laſt. They
                    did fo, and were ſuccefsſul in repulſing the French for ſome days between the
                    waal and the Leck ; but the republican army, amounting to 70,000 men, having at
                    laſt advanced in full force, the allied troops were compelied to retire acroſs
                    the Yſſel into weſtphalia^ In the courſe of their march throughthis deſert
                    country, in the midſt of ſevere froſt and a deep ſuow, they arc ſaid to have
                    ſuſſered incredible hardſhips, and to have loſt a very great number of men. The
                    French, in the mean time, advanced rapidly acrofs the country to the Zuyder fea,
                    to prevent the in-habitants ſrom flying, and carrying oſſ their property. On the
                    16th of January 1795, a party of horſe, without jreflſtance, took poſſeffion of
                    Amſterdam. The other towns furrendered at diſcretion. In confeqnence of an.
                    order from the States General, the ſlrong ſortreſſes of Bergen-op-zoon,
                    wiliiamftadt, Breda, &amp;c. opened their gates to the French. The fleet and
                    the ſhipping were fixed by the intenſe froſt in their Rations, and fell a prey
                    to the enemy; who thus, with little effort, made a complete conqueſt of this
                    populous and once powerful country. The French were well received by the people
                    at large. The power of the Stadtholder had been ſupport-ed among them merely by
                    the influence of Pruffia and England. Through hatred to this officc, which had
                    now become odious chiefly to the mercantile ariſtocracy of Holland, they were
                    little attached to their allies, and gave them, during the preſent war, as
                    little ſupport as poſſible. The Stadtholder and his family now fled to England.
                    Tlie French declared, that they did not mean to make ſubjects but allies of the
                    Dutch, and invited them to call together popular aſſemblies for ſettling their
                    own government, under the protection of the French republic.</p>
                <p>Thus terminated a campaign, the moſt aſtoniſhing, perhaps, that has been known
                    in the hiſtory of mankind. In the courſe cf it, even before the conqueſt of
                    Holland, the French had taken 2000 pieces of cannon and 60,000 priſoners. Aſter
                    that event, the conquered ter-ritories added to them a population of nearly 14
                    millions of people. Luxembourg and Mentz were the only places on this ſide of
                    the Rhine that reſiſted them. The former was cloftly blockaded, for the purpoſe
                    of compelling it to ſurrender the latter was ſeveral times aſ-faulted,, but
                    ſucceſsfully held out.</p>
                <p>Europe was now weary of this bloody ſtrife. The German Diet of Ratiſhon declared
                    its reſolution to take meafures for procuring peace. Tile Grand Duke of Tuſcany
                    concluded a treaty with the French republic. France itſelſ, exhauſted by
                    maſſacrea, emigrations, and the terrible efforts which it had made, wiſhed for
                    tranquillity ; and the Convention found it neceſſary to declare that they were
                    willing to treat for peace with any of the powers of Europe, upon honourable
                    terms.</p>
                <p>The frequent changes, however, which have with aſtoniſhing rapidity taken place
                    in the mode oſ conduct-ing French affairs, and the different principles
                    diſplay-ed by the different factions as they ſucceffively got into power, have
                    produced in Great Britain and Auſtria a very general perſuaſion that no peace
                    concluded with the preſent Convention could either be honourable or per-manent ;
                    and therefore theſe two mighty nations have reſolved to continue the war with
                    redoubled vigour.— In ſupport oſ the wiſdom oſ this reſolutſon, it has been
                    obſerved, that the hatred oſ the Mountain to the Gi-rondiſts was Inch, that it
                    would have violated any treaty which had been concluded with thAa ; that when
                    Robeſpierre beoame all powerful, and terror was the order oſ the day, all former
                    meaſures were changed, and peace or war made wholly ſubſervient to the ambitious
                    views of that relentteſa tyrant ; that Taliien, having orig'nally belonged to
                    the Mountain, introduced the preſent ſyſtem of moderation, not from principle,
                    but only to reconcile the people to his uſurped authority, and the faſt of his
                    bloody predeceſſor ; that he may ſuddenly change his meaſures, or be denounced
                    and executed hy the influence of ſome more daring demagogue, who would again
                    introduce the fyſtem of terror; and that in ſuch a ſtate of uncertainty, the
                    only confe-qnence to be expected from making peace at preſent is, that it would
                    furniſh the next faction which may gain, the aſeendancy in France with an
                    opportunity of attacking the allies when leſs prepared to receive them.. Such
                    reafoning as this has been admitted in the Britiih. parliament, where a loan of
                    ſix millions Sterling has. been voted to the Emperor, to enable him to begin the
                    enſuing campaign with an army of 2-00,000 men. In what manner the war ought to
                    be conducted, it is not for ns to ſay. The Britiſh nation feems to reſt its
                    hopes on its ſuperiority at ſea ; and the greateſt exertions are making to
                    augment and man the navy. But we are here under the neceffity of dropping this
                    ſubject, with-out being able completely to fulfil the promiſe which we made to
                    our readers at the end of the article France, There is as little appearance at
                    preſent of peace, and a ſteady government being foon reſtored to that diſtracted
                    eountry, as there was at the beginning of the troubles ; and there is not the
                    ſmalleſt probab;-lity that the republican conſtitution, framed by the
                    Convention, will laſt one year after the diſſolution of that aſſembly.</p>
                <p>In tracing the origin and progrefs of this wonderful revolution, we have
                    conſulted every work from which we had reaſon to look ſor information, aad we
                    have confined ourſelves to a ſimple narration of facts, ſeldom giving way to the
                    reflections which they ſuggeſted. Our facts, too, have been generally ſtated
                    from writers who are ſuppoſed to be not unfriendly to democracy, that they may
                    gain the fuller credit with our own reformers ; lor in the moſt favourable point
                    of view in which thoſe facts can be placed, they furniſh the ſtrongeſt objection
                    poffible to all their propoſed reformations of the Britiſh conſtitution. If the
                    horrible deeds of darknefs which have been acted on the theatre of France cannot
                    make us contented with the government under which we live, and which has been
                    brought to its preſent ſtate of perfection, not by the metaphyſical ſpeculations
                    of recluſe philofophers, but by obfervation and the practical experience of
