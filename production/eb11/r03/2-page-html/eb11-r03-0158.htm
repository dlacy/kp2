<p><span class="font0">End and Headlands. There are large granite quarries along the coast, especially in Pigeon Cove, and there are two varieties&nbsp;of granite, called commercially “ grey ” and “ green,” both&nbsp;very hard, the former the more abundant. It has been used&nbsp;in building the great breakwater off Sandy Bay and various&nbsp;large bridges. Granite for paving-stones is quarried. Like&nbsp;many of the Maine quarries those of Rockport owe much of&nbsp;their development to their nearness to deep water transportation. Isinglass, glue, tools, parts for automobile engines, and&nbsp;copper paint are among the -manufactures. Fishing was&nbsp;formerly of importance, but quarrying has displaced it. Sandy&nbsp;Bay, the fifth parish of Gloucester, first settled about 1697,&nbsp;and Pigeon Cove, part of the third parish, were set off from&nbsp;Gloucester and were incorporated as the township of Rockport&nbsp;in 1840. The Bennett &amp; Mackay transatlantic commercial&nbsp;cable was landed in Rockport in May 1884.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCKVILLE, a city of Tolland county, Connecticut, U.S.A., in the N.E. part of the state, on the Hockanum river, about&nbsp;15 m. N.E. of Hartford. Pop. (1890) 7772; (1900) 7287, of&nbsp;whom 2548 were foreign-born, many being Germans and Poles;&nbsp;(1910) 7977. It is served by the NewYork, New Haven &amp; Hartford railway and by electric lines. It is in the township of&nbsp;Vernon (pop. in 1890, 8808; in 1910, 9087; area, 19 sq. m.),&nbsp;which was separated from Bolton township in 1808, and contains the villages of Vernon, Vernon Centre, Dobsonville and&nbsp;Talcottville. In the city are the George Maxwell Memorial&nbsp;Library and the Sykes Manual Training School. The river, by&nbsp;a series of falls, makes a descent of 280 ft. here, and furnishes&nbsp;power for large manufacturing establishments. The principal&nbsp;manufactures are woollen, silk and cotton goods, envelopes, and&nbsp;silk fish-lines. In 1841 fancy cassimeres, probably the first&nbsp;manufactured in the United States, were made here. At the&nbsp;Hockanum Mills (established 1809) worsted for men’s clothing&nbsp;was first made (about 1870) in the United States. The first&nbsp;settlement here was made about 1726. Rockville was chartered&nbsp;as a city in 1889.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCKY MOUNTAIN GOAT, or Wiute Goat </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Oreamnus montanus),</span><span class="font0"> a North American hollow-horned ruminant of the&nbsp;family Bovidae, distinguished by its white colour. It is, in&nbsp;fact, the only ruminant, with the exception of the white Alaskan&nbsp;wild sheep, which is entirely white at aII seasons of the year;&nbsp;and cannot, therefore, be mistaken for any other animal, and its&nbsp;description may consequently be brief. In the winter coat the&nbsp;hair is long and pendent, elongated into a short beard on the&nbsp;sides of the lower jaw behind the chin; and it is also longer&nbsp;than elsewhere on the neck and the chest; at the base of the&nbsp;long hair is a thick growth of short and woolly under-fur. In&nbsp;summer the coat becomes comparatively short. The muzzle&nbsp;is hairy, the ears are of moderate size, and the tail is short, and&nbsp;partially buried among the long hair of the rump. There are&nbsp;no glands on the face; but there is a large globular one at the&nbsp;base of each horn of the size of half a small orange. The black&nbsp;horns, which are ringed in their basal portion, are comparatively&nbsp;short and not unlike those of the Asiatic serows in general&nbsp;characters, being Subcylindrical, and curving slightly backwards. They taper, however, much more rapidly than those&nbsp;of the serows, and diverge much more widely from the middle&nbsp;line. The lateral hoofs are well developed. Although commonly described as white, the hair has a more or less decided&nbsp;tinge of yellow, which appears to be more marked in the summer&nbsp;than in the winter coat. The cannon-bones are remarkably&nbsp;short and wide, and in this respect differ from those of all allied&nbsp;ruminants, except the Tibetan takin. The general shape of the&nbsp;animal is ungainly, owing to a huge hump on the withers, at&nbsp;which point the height is about 3 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The head of a white goat obtained in 1900 from the mountains at the mouth of Copper river, opposite Kyak Island, has been&nbsp;described as a species apart. In addition to certain details in&nbsp;the conformation of the skull, the horns are much more slender&nbsp;than in the ordinary white goat,, and instead of bending regularly backwards till near their tips, curve widely outwards&nbsp;from their bases. Their length is nearly equal to that of the&nbsp;longest pair of the ordinary form hitherto recorded, while the&nbsp;tip-to-tip interval is nearly double that of any other known&nbsp;specimen. This animal can scarcely be regarded as more than&nbsp;a local race, and should be styled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oreamnus montanus kennedyi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The affinities of the white goat (which is really a member of a group intermediate between goats and antelopes) are probably&nbsp;with the Asiatic serows and takin, and hence perhaps with the&nbsp;musk-ox.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROCOCO, or Rocaille, literally “ rock-work,” a style of architectural and mobiliary decoration popular throughout&nbsp;the greater part of Europe during the first half of the 18th&nbsp;century. In France it was especially characteristic of the&nbsp;regency and the reign of Louis XV. A debased style at the best,&nbsp;essentially fantastic and bizarre, it ended in extravagance and&nbsp;decadence. A meaningless mixture of imitation rock-work,&nbsp;shells, scrolls and foliage, the word came eventually to be&nbsp;applied to anything extravagant, Aamboyantor tasteless in art&nbsp;or literature. The very exuberance of the rococo forms is,&nbsp;indeed, the negation of art, which is based upon restraint.&nbsp;There is something fundamentally Italian in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bravura</span><span class="font0"> upon&nbsp;which the style depends; yet Italy has produced some of the&nbsp;worst examples of what in that country is called the “ Jesuit&nbsp;style,” in allusion to the supposed lack of directness in Jesuit&nbsp;policy. Everything, indeed, in the rococo manner is involved&nbsp;and tortured, though before a superb example of Jacques&nbsp;CafiSeri, such as the famous commode in the Wallace Collection,&nbsp;it is impossible not to admire the art with which genius can&nbsp;treat even the defects and weaknesses of a peculiarly mannered&nbsp;fashion. The best French work possesses a balance and symmetry which are usually entirely absent from its imitations.&nbsp;Spain and Italy produced many monstrous travesties—it is&nbsp;impossible to imagine anything more grotesque than the flamboyant convolutions of the monumental Roman style of the&nbsp;third quarter of the 18th century. In Germany, weak and lifeless imitations were as popular as might be imagined in a land&nbsp;which was content to take its art, especially its bad art, from&nbsp;France. England did not escape the infection, and Chippendale&nbsp;and his school produced examples of rocaille work and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coquillage&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">which were quite foreign to their own sentiment, and rarely&nbsp;rose above respectable mediocrity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROCROI, a town of northern France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Ardennes, 22 m. N.N.W. of Charle-ville by rail, and within 2 m. of the Belgian frontier. Pop. (1906) town, 796; commune, 2116. As a fortified place it commands&nbsp;the Ardennes plateau between the valley of the Meuse and the&nbsp;head-waters of the Oise. The present fortifications, constructed&nbsp;by Vauban, form a pentagon and entirely close in the town,&nbsp;which has regularly built streets converging on a central square.&nbsp;Overlooking the latter is the church, a Aorid building of the&nbsp;18th century. Rocroi is the seat of a sub-prefect and has a&nbsp;tribunal of first instance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The place, originally calIed Croix-de-Rau or Rau Croix, was fortified in the 16th century and besieged by the imperialists&nbsp;in 1555. Invested by the Spaniards in 1643, it was relieved&nbsp;by Louis II., the duke of Enghien (afterwards the Great Condé),&nbsp;after a brilliant victory. Captured in 1658 by the same duke,&nbsp;then in the Spanish service, it was not restored to France till&nbsp;the treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659. In 1815 Rocroi was besieged for a month by the allies.</span></p>
