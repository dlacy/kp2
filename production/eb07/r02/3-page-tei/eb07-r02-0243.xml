This will be ascertained when we know the velocity impressed upon a body containing a given quantity of matter. Thus we know that terrestrial gravity acting on a body for a second, will cause it to fall sixteen feet with an uniformly accelerated motion, and will leave it in a state such that it would move on for ever at the rate of thirty-two feet per second. The force of gravity is therefore such as to communicate a velocity of thirty-two feet per second ; and in this case the mase of the body is not considered, for gravity acts equally on every particle of which it is composed. In the same manner, the best way of acquiring a distinct conception of the rotatory effect of a moving force, is to determine the quantity of rotatory motion which it can generate by acting uniformly during some known time.</p><p>7.    If a solid body, or rigid system of invariable form, admit of a rotatory motion about an axis, and if at any point of the body a force P be applied, which acts in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and tends to turn the body in one direction ; and to any other point in the same plane a force Q be applied, tending to turn the body in the opposite direction ; then, if the two forces be to each other inversely as the distances of the lines of their directions respectively from the axis, the body will remain at rest, or the two forces will be in equilibrium.</p><p>For let O (fig. 1) be the axis of rotation, and suppose the force P to be applied at the point P in the direction PA, and tending to turn the solid body about</p><p>tlle axis O perpendicular to the plane</p><p>of the paper, and let the force Q act</p><p>in the direction QB, and consequent</p><p>ly tend to turn the body in the oppo</p><p>site direction, and draw OA perpen</p><p>dicular to PA, and OB perpendicu</p><p>lar to QB. Then, in order that there</p><p>may be equilibrium, we must have,</p><p>by the principle of the lever, P : Q : : OB : OA, whence P ∙ OA = Q ∙ OB.</p><p>8.    It is obviously indifferent at what point of the plane the force is applied, provided its distance from the axis remains the same· Let BO therefore be produced, and take OC equal to OA, and draw CR perpendicular to BC, or parallel to BQ. We may now suppose the force P to be replaced by an equal force R, acting in the direction RC ; then, since R ∙ OC = P ∙ O A, we have R ∙ OR = Q ∙ OB, and, consequently, the axis being supposed fixed, the body will remain in equilibrium between the two forces Qand R. These forces are therefore equivalent to a single force applied at O, equal to their sum, and acting in a parallel direction. Hence the resultant of two parallel forces applied to a straight line is a force parallel to the component forces, equal to their sum, and whose line of direction divides the straight line into parts reciprocally proportional to the forces themselves.</p><p>9.    If two forces, which are inversely as the distances of their respective directions from the axis of rotation, be applied to a body, the equilibrium will still be</p><p>maintained, although the two forces are not in the same plane. Let OO' be two points in the axis of rotation, through which let there be drawn two planes <hi rend="italic">Aa</hi>  and Βό at right angles to the axis. Suppose also these planes to be intersected by another plane (here supposed to be the plane of the figure) passing through the axis, and let OA, O'B be the intersections, and let the straight line which joins A and B intersect the axis in C. Let P and Q be two forces applied respectively at A and B in the planes A0α and BO⅛, and at right angles to O A and O'B, or perpendicular to the plane of the paper, then these two forces are parallel ; and because by hypothesis P : Q : ; O'B : OA,</p><p>we have P : Q : : CB : CA ; therefore (8) the two forces P and Q are equivalent to a single parallel force passing through C. But a force passing through the axis has no tendency to turn the body round the axis ; consequently the body remains at rest.</p><p>10.    Let wl, <hi rend="italic">m', m",</hi>  &amp;c. (fig. 3) be a system of bodies immoveable in respect of each other, and suppose them to revolve about an axis passing through O ;</p><p>also let <hi rend="italic">m, m', rn",</hi>  &amp;c. denote the quanti</p><p>ties of matter in the bodies respectively,</p><p>and let r, r', r", &amp;c. denote their dis</p><p>tances from the axis of rotation. Let the</p><p>angular velocity of the system be <hi rend="italic">w ;</hi>  then</p><p>(2) the absolute velocities of the bodies</p><p>are respectively <hi rend="italic">tor, tor', wr", &amp;c.</hi>  Now</p><p>let us suppose the system to be put in</p><p>motion by an external force F applied at the point P, in tlle direction PA, which is contained in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation ; then the relation between the force F and the velocity <hi rend="italic">w</hi>  may be found as follows. Considering, first, the body <hi rend="italic">m ;</hi>  since its velocity = <hi rend="italic">wr,</hi>  and its quantity of matter = rn, its quantity of motion = <hi rend="italic">wrm.</hi>  But it is a principle in dynamics, that the quantity of motion of a moving body is proportional to the impressed force, and may be taken as a measure of that force ; whence <hi rend="italic">wrm</hi>  is the measure of a force which, if applied at <hi rend="italic">m,</hi>  in a direction perpendicular to <hi rend="italic">Om,</hi>  would cause <hi rend="italic">m</hi>  to begin to move with the actual velocity <hi rend="italic">tor.</hi>  Let/be the force which, if applied at P in the direction PA, would make equilibrium with the force <hi rend="italic">wrm</hi>  at <hi rend="italic">m ;</hi>  draw OA perpendicular to PA, and make OA = <hi rend="italic">h.</hi>  We have then (7)</p><p><hi rend="italic">f : wrm : : Om</hi>  : O A : : <hi rend="italic">r : h,</hi></p><p>whence<hi rend="italic">fh = wr~m.</hi>  In like manner, the quantities of motion in the bodies <hi rend="italic">m', m",</hi>  &amp;c. are <hi rend="italic">wr'm', wr"ni',</hi>  &amp;c. ; and if we denote by/,/", &amp;c. the forces which, if applied at P in the direction PA, would respectively make equilibrium with the forces <hi rend="italic">wr<hi rend="sup">j</hi>m', wr"m",</hi>  &amp;c. we shall have<hi rend="italic">f'h — wd<hi rend="sup">i</hi>m',f''h = tor<hi rend="sup">,</hi>'<hi rend="sup">i</hi>ml', &amp;c.</hi>  ; therefore, if we assume</p><p>F =∕+∕+∕'+, &amp;c. we shall have the equation</p><p>F ∙ <hi rend="italic">h = w (f<hi rend="sup">l</hi>m + r<hi rend="sup">n</hi>m'</hi>  + r<hi rend="sup">,</hi>'<hi rend="sup">i</hi>zw" +, &amp;c.).</p><p>If we suppose <hi rend="italic">m = m' = m"</hi>  =, &amp;c. and take <hi rend="italic">r</hi>  to denote the distance of any particle from the axis of rotation, the equation becomes F ∙ <hi rend="italic">h = wl</hi>  (r<hi rend="sup">2</hi>m) ; the summation denoted by2 extending to every particle in the system.</p><p>11.    When the direction of the external force F is not in a plane parallel to the circles of rotation, it must be resolved into two forces, one of which lies in that plane, and the other is parallel to the axis. It is only the first of these forces which in the present case is regarded as the moving force ; the second merely tends to push tlle body in the direction of the axis, and does not influence the rotation. When we come to consider the rotation of a body perfectly free, it will be necessary to attend particularly to this circumstance.</p><p>12.    A solid body may be regarded as composed of molecules of a very small but finite magnitude, connected so as to form an invariable system ; and although a solid, according to his view of the constitution of body, is formed of discrete elements, the sums relative to the molecules may be changed into definite integrals without sensible error ; that is to say, for the sums 2r<hi rend="sup">s</hi>m we may substitute the definite integrals <hi rend="italic">∕r<hi rend="sup">2</hi>dm,</hi>  where <hi rend="italic">dm</hi>  is the element of the mass, and the integrals extend to the whole mass. We have then F ∙ <hi rend="italic">h = ufr<hi rend="sup">i</hi>dm,</hi></p><p>13.    The energy of a force applied to a lever, or its power of producing motion round the fulcrum, is expressed by the product of the force into the perpendicular drawn from the fulcrum upon the line of its direction. This product (denoted above by F ∙ A) is called the <hi rend="italic">moment,</hi>  or momentum, or rotatory effort, of the force F. And because <hi rend="italic">fd<hi rend="sup">i</hi>dm</hi>  is</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
