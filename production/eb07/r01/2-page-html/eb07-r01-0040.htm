        <p><span class="font1">the object apparently being merely to comply with the act of
                Parliament, certainly not to let the passengers see the miles,&nbsp;for the marks
                are generally so short, that all persons in the&nbsp;middle seats of the carriages
                have no chance whatever of&nbsp;seeing them. What we should recommend would be
                light&nbsp;iron posts having a box on the top. The box may be made&nbsp;triangular
                in its ground-plan, (Plate CCCCXXV. fig. 5,)&nbsp;and be about one foot in height,
                the apex of the most obtuse&nbsp;angle facing the railway. This angle should be so
                obtuse as&nbsp;merely to allow room in the box to hang a small lamp, and&nbsp;the
                two sides which form this angle being made of glass,&nbsp;should be painted or
                ground, except the figures, which are&nbsp;left clear. These shew the miles by day,
                and the nearest policeman lighting the lamp, they are also shewn at night.
                Or&nbsp;the planes forming the sides of the triangle next the railway may be of
                sheet iron, with the figures cut out of it,&nbsp;and merely that portion covered
                with glass ; in either case&nbsp;the head must have a lid moving on a hinge. The
                height&nbsp;of these should be just half way up the carriage windows.&nbsp;In the
                cuttings, the post should be very short, and the mile&nbsp;mark set back on the
                slope. On the embankments it will&nbsp;be proportionally longer. It may have holes,
                or other ornaments, cast in its base, serving for steps to get up to light&nbsp;the
                lamp ; or this may be done with projecting rings, and a&nbsp;slide may be made to
                receive coloured glass as a signal of&nbsp;any accident.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">When such mile marks as these are not adopted, and it is desired to
                know the velocity of a train at night, this&nbsp;may be readily done whenever the
                blast pipe of the engine&nbsp;sounds sufficiently loud to be heard, which is
                generally the&nbsp;case in most engines. The way to ascertain the speed
                at&nbsp;which the train is going, will be to count every fourth puff&nbsp;from the
                blast pipe in ten seconds, this giving one revolution of the driving wheels, and the
                speed will be had by the&nbsp;following table :</span></p>

        <p><span class="font1">The rapidity with which the cylinders of steam are expelled through
                the blast pipe, would at any common velocity prevent every puff being counted ; but
                a very little practice will render the counting of every’ fourth one exceedingly
                easy, and the rate of going may always be found to&nbsp;the nearest half mile, by
                those who have only tried this&nbsp;method three or four times. A still easier
                method, although&nbsp;it will not generally be quite so accurate, is as follows :
                For&nbsp;five-feet wheels, count the number of fourth puffs in ten seconds and three
                quarters, and these will be the number of&nbsp;miles per hour the engine is going ;
                and for five feet six&nbsp;wheels, count the number of fourth puffs in eleven
                seconds&nbsp;and three quarters. The exact number of seconds is 10∙7&nbsp;and 11∙78.
                The method by the tables however is the best.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Paved crossings on a level with the railway are things to be avoided
                by all means whenever it is practicable to do so ;&nbsp;but as some cases will arise
                where they cannot be done away&nbsp;with, we must render them as little liable to
                danger as possible. We have given drawings of these, (figs. 29, 30,&nbsp;and 31,)
                and an approved form of chair (fig. 28), which&nbsp;holds the rail, and also the two
                protecting irons, which should&nbsp;be laid next to the rails, in order that the
                wheels of those&nbsp;vehicles which cross the railway may not impinge upon
                the&nbsp;rails and injure them any more than can be helped. The&nbsp;whole crossing
                should be well paved with the usual road&nbsp;stones, and there must be strong gates
                on each side. These&nbsp;gates must be constructed so that when shut they may
                close&nbsp;up the road on either hand, and when open, may form a&nbsp;barrier across
                the railway.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The subject of lamps forms one to which attention is required, and we
                should recommend all railways to make a rcd light at night and a red flag by day,
                the symbols of danger. A green light should be placed at each station at
                the&nbsp;spot where the engine-man should slacken his speed, and a&nbsp;red light at
                the point where he is to stop. The police&nbsp;should have hand lanthoms, with a
                white glass and a red&nbsp;one, which latter can be turned round in an instant,
                whenever any thing obstructs the passage of the railway ; and the&nbsp;light held up
                at any train approaching, on seeing which the&nbsp;train is immediately to stop. A
                green glass may also be&nbsp;added, the signification of which would be, proceed
                with&nbsp;caution ; the train should then come slowly on and ascertain&nbsp;the
                reason for the signal.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">For lighting the insides of the carriages, the roof lamps, contrived
                by the writer of this article, and patented, are the&nbsp;best. The frame is
                circular, about six inches in diameter, and&nbsp;about nine inches in height; the
                bottom is formed of a ground&nbsp;glass saucer, which is let through the roof of the
                coach, the&nbsp;top being protected by a box ; on the inside is a small fountain
                lamp, on an improved principle, which is very nearly&nbsp;shadowless ; the whole of
                the lamp body being above the&nbsp;frame, and the connection between them consisting
                of a&nbsp;tube¼<sup>l</sup><sub>δ</sub> ths of an inch in thickness, which tube
                should always&nbsp;be turned towards the carriage door. These give a
                soft&nbsp;mellow light, by which the passengers may easily read.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">Point signals should be made in the following manner.</span></p>
