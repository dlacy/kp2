ΓILEGE (<hi rend="italic">Sortilegium)</hi>, a ſpecies of divination performed by means of <hi rend="italic">ſortes</hi> or lots.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">ſortes Preneſtinae,</hi> famous in antiquity, conſiſted in putting a number of letters, or even whole words, into an urn ; and then, after ſhaking them together, they were thrown on the ground ; and whatever ſentences could be made out from them, conſtituted the anſwer of the oracle. To this method of divination ſucceeded that which has been called the <hi rend="italic">fortes Home- rianae and sortes Virgilianae,</hi> a mode of inquiring into futurity, which undoubtedly took its riſe from a general cuſtom of the oracular prieſts of delivering their anſwers in verſe ; it ſubſiſted a long time among thc Greeks and Romans ; and being from them adopted by the Chriſtians, it was not till after a long ſucceſſion of centuries that it became exploded. Among the Romans it consiſted in opening ſome celebrated poet at random, and among the CEriſtians the Scriptures, and drawing, from the firſt paſſage which preſented itſelf to the eye, a prognoſtic of what would befal one’s ſelf or others, or direction for conduct when under any exigency. There is good evidence that this was none of the vulgar errors ; the greateſt perſons, philoſophers of the beſt repute, admitted this ſuperſtition. Socrates, when in priſon, hearing this line of Homer,</p><p>Within three days I Phthia’s ſhore ſhall fee,<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0617.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0611"/>
immediately ſaid, within three days I ſhall be out of the world ; gathering it from the double meaning of the word <hi rend="italic">Phthia,</hi> which in Greek is both the name of a country and ſignifies corruption or death. This prediction, addreſſed to Æschinus, was not eaſily forgotten, as it was verified.</p><p>When this ſuperſtition paſſed ſrom Paganiſm into Chriſtianity, the Chriſtians had two methods of consulting the divine will from the Scriptures ; the one, casually, to open the divine writings, and take their direction, as above-mentioned; the other, to go to church with a purpoſe of receiving, as a declaration of the will of heaven, the words of the Scripture, which were ſinging at the inſtant of one’s entrance.</p><p>This unwarrantable practice of inquiring into futurity prevailed very generally in England till the beginning of the preſent century ; and ſometimes the books of Scripture, and ſometimes the poems of Virgil, were conſulted for oracular reſponſes. One remarkable instance is that of King Charles I. who being at Oxford during the civil wars, went one day to ſee the public library, where he was ſhowed, among other books, a Virgil nobly printed and exquiſitely bound. The lord Falkland, to divert the king, would have his majeſty make a trial of his fortune by the <hi rend="italic">Sortes Virgilianœ.</hi> Whereupon the king opening the book, the period which happened to come up was this :</p><p><hi rend="italic">At bello audacis populi vexatus, et armis,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Finibus extorris, complexu avulsus Iuli,</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Auxilium imploret ; videatque indigna suorum Funera; nec, cum ſe ſub leges pacis iniquae</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Tradiderat, regno aut optata luce fruatur ;</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Sed cadat ante diem, mediaque inhumatus arena.</hi></p><p>Æneid. lib. iv.</p><p>Yet let a race, untamed and haughty focs,</p><p>His peaceful entrance with dire arms oppoſe; Oppreſſed with numbers in the unequal field,</p><p>His men diſcouraged, and himſelf expelled,</p><p>Let men for ſuccour ſue from place to place,</p><p>Torn from his ſubjects, and his ſon’s embrace :</p><p>Firſt let him ſee his friends in battle ſlain,</p><p>And their untimely fate lament in vain ;</p><p>And when at length the cruel war ſhall ceaſe,</p><p>On hard conditions may he buy his peace.</p><p>Nor let him then enjoy ſupreme command,</p><p>But fall untimely by ſome hoſtile hand,</p><p>And lie unburied on the barren sand.</p><p>Lord Falkland obſerving that the king was concerned at this accident, would likewiſe try his own fortune in the ſame manner, hoping he might fall upon ſome paſſage that would have no relation to his caſe, and thereby divert the king’s thoughts from any impreſſion which the other might have upon him ; but the place he stumbled upon was as much ſuited to his deſtiny as the other had been to the king’s ; being the lamentation of Evander for the untimely death of his ſon Pallas<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* AEnid.
