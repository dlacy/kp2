                prolific literature of which it has been the subject, it must be admitted that in
                many points our knowledge of it is incomplete and uncertain.&nbsp;The prevalent
                opinion, formed before the discovery of the Verona&nbsp;MS. had made known Gaius’s
                description of it, and almost universally adhered to ever since, is that such
                contracts were created by&nbsp;entries in the account-books which the censors
                insisted that all&nbsp;citizens of any means should keep with scrupulous
                regularity.&nbsp;They are often alluded to by the lay writers; but the text
                principally relied on is what remains of Cicero’s speech for the
                player&nbsp;Roscius. From the tenor of the argument in that case, and incidental
                remarks elsewhere, the conclusion has been formed that a&nbsp;citizen who made an
                entry in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >codex—</span><span class="font1">whether of the nature&nbsp;of a cash-book or a
                ledger is much disputed—to the debit of another,&nbsp;thereby made the latter his
                debtor for a sum recoverable by an&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"

                > Gaius in his description of the contract does not mention the </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">codices</span><span class="font1"> ; but
                his account is not inconsistent with the notion that the entries </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{nomina)</span><span class="font1"> of
                which he&nbsp;speaks were made in them. He says that those entries were of&nbsp;two
                sorts, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nomina
                arcaria</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">nomina transscripticia.</span><span class="font1"> The
                former&nbsp;were entries of cash advances ; and of them lie observes that
                they&nbsp;did not create obligation, but only served as evidence of one
                already&nbsp;created by payment to and receipt of the money by the borrower.&nbsp;Of
                the latter he says that there were two varieties, the entry transcribed from thing
                to person and that transcribed from one person&nbsp;to another, and that both of
                them were not probative merely but&nbsp;creative of obligation. The first was
                effected by a creditor (A)&nbsp;entering to the debit of his debtor (B) the
                liquidated amount of&nbsp;what the latter was already owing as the price of
                something purchased, the rent of a house leased, the value of work done, or
                the&nbsp;like. The second was effected by A transcribing B’s debt to the&nbsp;debit
                of a third party (C), hitherto a debtor of B’s, and who consented to the
                transaction, —A at the same time crediting B with&nbsp;the sum thus booked against
                C, and B in his books both crediting&nbsp;C with it </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">{acceptilatio)</span><span class="font1"> and debiting A
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{expensilatio).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">All this at first sight seems just a series of bookkeeping
                operations. But it was much more than that for the Roman citizens who first had
                recourse to it. There was a time when sale, and&nbsp;lease, and the like, so long as
                they stood on their own merits,&nbsp;created no obligation enforcible at law,
                however much it might be&nbsp;binding as a duty to Fides or (as moderns would say)
                in the forum&nbsp;of conscience ; to found an action it required to be clothed in
                some&nbsp;form approved by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >jus civile.</span><span class="font1"> The </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">nexum</span><span class="font1"> may have been one
                of&nbsp;those forms, the vendee or tenant being fictitiously dealt with
                as&nbsp;borrower of the price or rent due under his purchase or lease ;
                the&nbsp;stipulation was another, the obligation to pay the price or rent&nbsp;being
                made legally binding by its embodiment in formal question&nbsp;and answer. But
                stipulation was competent only between persons&nbsp;who were face to face, whereas
                expensilation was competent also&nbsp;as between persons at a distance from each
                other. This of itself&nbsp;gave expensilation—which, originally at least, was as
                much a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">negotiant juris
                civilis</span><span class="font1"> as the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">sponsio—</span><span class="font1">an advantage in some
                cases over&nbsp;stipulation. But it had also a further advantage, which was
                not&nbsp;affected by the subsequent recognition of the real and
                consensual&nbsp;contracts as productive of legal obligation on their own merits:
                it&nbsp;paved the way for subsequent transcription from one person to&nbsp;another.
                This last must have been of infinite convenience in commerce, not only by enabling
                traders to dispense with a reserve&nbsp;of coin, but by obviating the risks
                attending the transit of money&nbsp;over long distances. It was this that led, as
                Theophilus says was&nbsp;the case, to the conversion even of stipulatory obligations
                into&nbsp;book-debts ; it was not that thereby the creditor obtained a
                tighter&nbsp;hold over his debtor, but that an obligation was obtained from
                him&nbsp;which in a sense was negotiable and therefore more valuable.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The evolution of the four purely consensual contracts—sale, location,
                partnership, and mandate—supplies matter for one of the most interesting chapters in
                the whole history of the law. But, as&nbsp;it is impossible in such an article as
                this to attempt to mark the&nbsp;successive stages in the progress of all of them,
                we shall confine&nbsp;ourselves to sale. The others did not and could not follow
                identically the same course : location ran most nearly parallel with sale ;&nbsp;but
                partnership and mandate, from their nature, not only started&nbsp;at a different
                point from the other two, but reached the same goal&nbsp;with them—tliat of becoming
                productive of obligation simply on&nbsp;the strength of consent interchanged by the
                parties—by paths that&nbsp;were sometimes far apart. Nevertheless a sketch of the
                history of the&nbsp;origin of the contract of sale may be sufficient to indicate
                generally&nbsp;some of the milestones that were successively passed by all
                    four.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p><div>

                    pounds&nbsp;weight of copper on the other. With the reforms of Servius
                    Tullius&nbsp;came the distinction between </span><span class="font1"

                    growth of custom it is impossible to say ; but it is in the&nbsp;highest degree
                    probable that it was the XII. Tables which fixed&nbsp;that the measure of the
                    transferrer’s liability to the transferee in&nbsp;the event of eviction should
                    be double the amount of the price.&nbsp;Equally impossible is it to say when the

                    clothed. They received statutory&nbsp;sanction in the Tables, in the words

                    lingua nuncupassit,&nbsp;itajus esto,” substantially “whatever shall by word of
                    mouth be&nbsp;declared by the parties in the course of a transaction

                    imaginary sale, they enacted that, mancipation notwithstanding, the property of
                    what was sold should not pass to the&nbsp;purchaser until the price had been
                    paid or security by sureties&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"

                    eviction should attach&nbsp;to the transferrer (or </span><span class="font1"

                    provision in the&nbsp;XII. Tables was that a vendor who had mancipated or
                    delivered&nbsp;a thing sold by him before receiving the price had no action
                    to&nbsp;enforce payment of the latter; and in such circumstances it
                    was&nbsp;thought but right to give him the opportunity of getting back
                    the&nbsp;thing itself by a real action. It might be, however, that the
                    price&nbsp;had been paid, and yet the vendor refused to mancipate. It
                    was&nbsp;long, apparently, before the purchaser could in such a case
                    compel&nbsp;him to do so. With the introduction of the </span><span

                    condic-tionem</span><span class="font1"> he (the purchaser) had undoubtedly the
                    power to recover&nbsp;the money on the ground of the vendor’s unjustifiable
                    enrichment,&nbsp;—that the latter had got it for a consideration which had
                    failed&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{causa data,

            <p><span class="font1">Down to this point, therefore, say the beginning of the 6th
                    century, there were several obligations consequent on sale of a </span><span

                    class="font1"> ; but not one of them arose directly out of the sale
                    itself,&nbsp;or could be enforced simply on the ground that it had taken
                    place.&nbsp;The vendor was bound to support the purchaser in any action
                    by&nbsp;a third party disputing his right, and to repay him the price twofold in
                    the event of that third party’s success ; and he was bound,&nbsp;moreover, to
                    make good to him any loss he had sustained through&nbsp;a deficiency of acreage
                    he had guaranteed, non-existence of servitudes he had declared the lands

                    committed a breach&nbsp;of contract, but because he had unjustly enriched
