<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Authorities.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">—Many of the leading authorities have already been named. To these may be added on the Roman Catholic side Perrone,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Praclectiones Thcologicae,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> vol. ii. “DeCultu Sanctorum,” cap. iv.&nbsp;(ed. Paris, 1863), and Martigny, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dictionnaire des Antiquités Chrétiennes (s. v.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> “Reliques”). Un the other side the followers of&nbsp;Calvin (on this as on so many other topics) are usually more&nbsp;fiercely anti-Roman than those of Luther. Among Anglican&nbsp;divines those who have published treatises on the Thirty-nine&nbsp;Articles are necessarily brought across the subject. The work of&nbsp;the bishop of Winchester (Dr Harold Browne) will here be found ;&nbsp;the fullest and most able as well as the most candid and temperate.&nbsp;Compare also Bp. Pearson, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Minor ]Forks,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> vol. il (J. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">G. C.)&nbsp;RELIEF. See Sculpture.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RELIGIONS. Religions, by which are meant the modes of divine worship proper to different tribes, nations,&nbsp;or communities, and based on the belief held in common&nbsp;by the members of them severally, were not before the&nbsp;present century the subject of original scientific research&nbsp;and comparative study. With the exception of a few&nbsp;good books containing useful information on some ancient&nbsp;religions and on the religious customs of uncivilized&nbsp;nations, nothing written on this subject in former centuries can be said to possess any scientific value. It is not&nbsp;that the old books are antiquated, as all works of learning&nbsp;must become with the lapse of time : they were worth&nbsp;nothing even when published. There were huge collections, containing descriptions of all the religions in the&nbsp;world, so far as they were known, laboriously compiled,&nbsp;but without any critical acumen, and without the least&nbsp;suspicion that unbiblical religions are not mere curiosities.&nbsp;There was a philosophy of religion, but it was all but&nbsp;purely speculative, and it could not be otherwise, as then&nbsp;it had but scanty means to work with, and was obliged to&nbsp;draw the facts it required from very troubled and insufficient sources. Attempts were made to explain the mythologies of the Greeks and the Romans, and even of some&nbsp;Oriental nations, but for the same reason they could not&nbsp;but fail. Then there was the theological bias, which&nbsp;caused all religions except one to be regarded as utterly&nbsp;false; the philosophical bias, which caused all religions,&nbsp;except the arbitrary abstraction then called natural religion,&nbsp;to be decried as mere superstitions, invented by shrewd&nbsp;priests and tyrants for selfish ends ; and, finally, the total&nbsp;lack of a sound method in historical investigation, which&nbsp;was one of the prominent characteristics of the 18th&nbsp;century. It was only after the brilliant discoveries which&nbsp;marked the end of that century and the first half of this,&nbsp;and after the not less brilliant researches to which they&nbsp;gave rise ; after the sacred writings of the Chinese, the&nbsp;Indians, the Persians, and some other ancient nations&nbsp;could be studied in the original ; after the finding of the&nbsp;key to the Egyptian hieroglyphics and the Assyrian and&nbsp;Babylonian cuneiform writing had lifted the veil Avhich&nbsp;for many centuries had covered the history of these most&nbsp;ancient civilizations—it was then only that a history of&nbsp;religion could be thought of and that something like a&nbsp;science of religion could be aimed at, if not yet founded.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The comparative historical study of religions is one of the means indispensable to the solution of the difficult&nbsp;problem What is religion ?—the other being a psychological&nbsp;study of man. It is one of the pillars on which not a&nbsp;merely speculative and fantastic, and therefore worthless, but a sound scientific philosophy of religion should&nbsp;rest. Still, like every department of study, it has its aim&nbsp;in itself. This aim is not to satisfy a vain curiosity, but&nbsp;to understand and explain one of the mightiest motors in&nbsp;the history of mankind, which formed as well as tore&nbsp;asunder nations, united as well as divided empires, which</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">sanctioned the most atrocious and barbarous deeds, the most cruel and libidinous customs, and inspired the most&nbsp;admirable acts of heroism, self-renunciation, and devotion,&nbsp;which occasioned the most sanguinary wars, rebellions,&nbsp;and persecutions, as well as brought about the freedom,&nbsp;happiness, and peace of nations—at one time a partisan of&nbsp;tyranny, at another breaking its chains, now calling into&nbsp;existence and fostering a new and brilliant civilization,&nbsp;then the deadly foe to progress, science, and art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Religions, like living organisms, have a history, and therefore this is to be studied first, so far as it can be&nbsp;known,—how they rise and spread, grow and fade away;&nbsp;how far they are the creations of individual genius, and&nbsp;how far of the genius of nations and communities; by what&nbsp;laws, if it is possible to discover them, their development is&nbsp;ruled; what are their relations to philosophy,science,and art,&nbsp;to the state, to society, and above all to ethics; what is their&nbsp;mutual historical relation, that is, if one of them sprang&nbsp;from another, or if a whole group are to be derived from a&nbsp;common parent, or if they only borrowed from one another&nbsp;and were subject to one another’s influence; lastly, what&nbsp;place is to be assigned to each of those groups or single&nbsp;religions in the universal history of religion. The first&nbsp;result of this historical inquiry must be an attempt at a&nbsp;genealogical classification of religions, in which they are&nbsp;grouped after their proved or probable descent and affinity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">However, like every genuine scientific study, historical investigations, if they are to bear fruit, must be comparative. Not only has every religion as a whole, and every&nbsp;religious group, to be compared with others, that we may&nbsp;know in what particular qualities it agrees with or&nbsp;differs from them, and that we may determine its special&nbsp;characteristics, but, before this can be done, comparative study on a much larger scale must precede. Every&nbsp;religion has two prominent constituent elements, the one&nbsp;theoretical, the other practical—religious ideas and religious&nbsp;acts. The ideas may be vague conceptions, concrete&nbsp;myths, precise dogmas, either handed over by tradition or&nbsp;recorded in sacred books, combined or not into systems of&nbsp;mythology and dogmatics, summarized or not in a creed&nbsp;or symbol, but there is no living religion without something like a doctrine. On the other hand, a doctrine,&nbsp;however elaborate, does not constitute a religion. Scarcely&nbsp;less than by its leading ideas a religion is characterized&nbsp;by its rites and institutions, including in the higher phases&nbsp;of development moral precepts, in the highest phases&nbsp;ethical principles. It happens but very seldom, if ever,&nbsp;that those two elements balance each other. In different&nbsp;religions they are commonly found in very different&nbsp;proportions, some faiths being pre-eminently doctrinal&nbsp;or dogmatic, others pre-eminently ritualistic or ethical;&nbsp;but where one of them is wanting entirely religion no&nbsp;longer exists. Not that dogma and ritual are religion;&nbsp;they are only its necessary manifestations, the embodiment of what must be considered as its very life and&nbsp;essence, of that which as an inner conviction must be distinguished from a doctrine or creed—a belief. But we&nbsp;cannot get a knowledge of the belief which lies at the base&nbsp;of a particular doctrine and which prompts peculiar rites&nbsp;and acts, without studying the mythical and dogmatical&nbsp;conceptions and the ritual or ethical institutions in which&nbsp;it takes its shape, and without comparing these with&nbsp;others. This then is the task of what is called comparative theology in its widest sense, of which comparative&nbsp;mythology is only a branch, and in which more space and&nbsp;attention should be given to the hitherto much neglected&nbsp;comparative study of religious worship and of ethics in&nbsp;their relation to religion. It is then only that we can&nbsp;proceed to characterize and mutually compare religions&nbsp;themselves, regarded as a whole, and that we may come</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
