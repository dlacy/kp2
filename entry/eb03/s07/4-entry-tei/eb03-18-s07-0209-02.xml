or Chineſe <hi rend="smallcaps">Abacus ;</hi> an inſtrument for performing arithmetical operations, deſcribed by Du Halde in his Hiſtory of China.</p><p>It is compoſed of a ſmall board, crossed with 10 or 12 parallel rods or wires, each ſtrung with ivory balls, which are ſo divided by a partition in the middle, that two are on one side of it, and five on the other. The two in the upper part ſtand each for five units, and each of the five in the lower part for one. “ In joining and ſeparating theſe balls, they reckon much as we do with counters ; but, according to our author, more expeditiouſly than Europeans do even with figures.” This is hardly credible ; but if all the Chineſe weights and meaſures be decimally divided, as by his very lame deſcription of the <hi rend="italic">ſwanpan</hi> they would appear to be, it is easy to conceive how computation may be made by this inſtrument very expeditiouſly. The infiniment, too, may be ſo contrived as to suit any diviſion of weights and meaſures, and in that form be useful to the blind ; but as we have elſewhere given deſcriptions of ſuperior inſtruments, for their accommodation (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Blind)</hi> it is needleſs to offer in this place any improvement of the s <hi rend="italic">wan- pan.</hi></p></div></body></text></TEI>
