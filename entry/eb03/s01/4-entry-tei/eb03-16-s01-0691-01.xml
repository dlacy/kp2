There is ſcarce a ſymptom, diſorder, or accident, they do not think may befal the human frame in conſequence of the ſcanto. They are perſuaded that a man who has been frightened only by a dog, a viper, ſcorpion, or any other creature, which he has an antipathy to, will ſoon be ſeized with the ſame pains he would really feel, had he been torn with their teeth, or wounded with their venomous ſting; and that nothing can remove theſe nervous imaginary pangs but a ſtrong doſe of dilena, a ſpecies of cantharides found in Sicily.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SCAPE goat,</hi> in the Jewiſh antiquities, the goat which was ſet at liberty on the day of ſolemn expiation.

See his reaſons in his book <hi rend="italic">De leg. Hebr. ritual.</hi> Diſſert. viii. Among other things, he obſerves, that the ancient Jews uſed to ſubſtitute the name <hi rend="italic">Samaël</hi> for <hi rend="italic">Azazel;</hi> and many of them have ventured to affirm, that at the feaſt of expiation they were obliged to offer a gift to Samael to obtain his favour. Thus alſo the goat, ſent into the wildemeſs to Azazel, was underſtood to be a gift or oblation. Some Chriſtians have been of the ſame opinion. But Spencer thinks that the genuine reaſons of the ceremony were, 1. That the goat, loaded with the ſins of the people, and ſent to Azazel, might be a ſymbolical repreſentation of the miſerable condition of ſinners. 2. God ſent the goat thus loaded to the evil daemons, to ſhow that they were impure, thereby to deter the people from any converſation or familiarity with them. 3. That the goat ſent to Azazel, ſufficiently expiating all evils, the Iſraelites might the more willingly abſtain from the expiatory ſacrifices of the Gentiles.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
