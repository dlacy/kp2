            <p>Walpole to have it reſtored, for ever cut off this confiderable ſupply; which
                poſſibly had been only delayed, and might have been recovered by proper
                application.</p>
            <p>His diſtreſs now became ſo great, and ſo notorious, that a ſcheme was at length
                concerted for procuring him a permanent relief. It was propoſed that he ſhould
                retire into Wales, with an allowance of 501. <hi rend="italic">per annum,</hi> on
                which he was to live privately, in a cheap place, for ever quitting his town-haunts,
                and reſigning all farther pretenſions to fame. This offer he ſeemed gladly to
                accept; but his intentions were only to deceive his friends, by retiring for a
                while, to write another tragedy, and then to return with it to London in order to
                bring it upon the ſtage.</p>
            <p>In 1739, he ſet out for Swanſey, in the Briſtol ſtage- coach, and was furniſhed with
                15 guineas to bear the expence of his journey. But, on the 14th day after his
                departure, his friends and benefactors, the principal of whom was no other than the
                great Mr Pope, who expected to hear of his arrival in Wales, were ſurpriſed with a
                letter from Savage, inſormingthem that he was yet upon the road, and could not
                proceed for want of money. There was no other remedy than a remittance; which was
                ſent him, and by the help of which he was enabled to reach Briſtol, from whence he
                was to proceed to Swanſey by water. At Briſtol, however, he found an embargo laid
                upon the ſhipping; ſo that he could not immediately obtain a paſſage. Here,
                therefore, being obliged to ſtay for ſome time, he, with his uſual facility, ſo
                ingratiateel himſelf with the principal inhabitants, that he was frequently invited
                to their houſes, diſtinguiſhed at their public entertainments, and treated with a
                regard that highly gratified his vanity, and therefore eaſily engaged his
                affections. At length, with great reluctance, he proceeded to Swanſey; where he
                lived about a year, very much diſſatisfied with the</p>
            <p>diminution of his ſalary; for he had, in his letters, treated his contributors ſo
                inſolently, that moſt of them withdrew their ſubſcriptions. Here be finiſhed his
                tragedy, and reſolved to return with it to London: which was ſtrenuouſly oppoled by
                his great and confiant friend Mr Pope; who propoſed that Savage ſhould put this play
                into the hands of Mr Thomſon and Mr Mallet, in order that they might ſit it for the
                ſtage, that his friends ſhould receive the profits it might bring in, and that the
                author ſhould receive the produce by way of annuity. This kind and prudent ſcheme
                was rejected by Savage with the utmoſt contempt. He declared he would not ſubmit his
                works to any one’s correction; and that he would no longer be kept in
                leading-ſtrings. Accordingly he ſoon returned to Briſtol, in his way to London; but
                at Briſtol, meeting with a repetition of the lame kind treatment he had before found
                there, he was tempted to make a ſecond ſtay in that opulent city for ſome time. Here
                he was again not only careſſed and treated, but the ſum of 30l. was raiſed for him,
                with which it had been happy if he had immediately departed for London: But he never
                conſidered that a frequent repetition of ſuch kindneſs was not to be expected, and
                that it was poſſible to tire out the generoſity of his Briſtol friends, as he had
                before tired his friends everywhere elſe. In ſhort, he remained here till his
                company was no longer welcome. His viſits in every family were too often repeated;
                his wit had lolt its novelty, and his irregular behaviour grew troubleſome.
                Neceſſity came upon him before he was aware; his money was ſpent, his clothes were
                worn out, his appearance was ſhabby, and his preſence was diſgultſul at every table.
                He now began to find every man from home at whoſe houſe he called; and he found it
                difficult to obtain a dinner. Thus reduced, it would have been prudent in him to
                have withdrawn from the place; but prudence and Savage were never</p>
