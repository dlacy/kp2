<p><span class="font0">in 1839 with the exception of the Norman tower. Rawmarsh has large iron-works, steel rolling-mills and potteries, and there&nbsp;are collieries in the neighbourhood. At the time of the Conquest&nbsp;the manor was granted to Walter d’Eyncourt, and in the 12th&nbsp;century it was divided among the three daughters of his tenant&nbsp;Ralph Paganel, who is supposed to have been the founder of the&nbsp;church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAWTENSTALL, a municipal borough in the Rossendale parliamentary division of Lancashire, England, 17½ m. N. by W.&nbsp;from Manchester by the Lancashire &amp; Yorkshire railway.&nbsp;Pop. (1901) 31,053. This town is a modern creation of the&nbsp;cotton industry; at the beginning of the 19th century it was&nbsp;a secluded village in the wild hilly district of Rossendale Forest.&nbsp;The cotton and woollen industries employ the majority of the&nbsp;inhabitants, and there are stone quarries in the neighbourhood.&nbsp;The town was incorporated in 1891, and the corporation consists&nbsp;of a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 councillors. Area, 9535 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAY (Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">raid).</span><span class="font0"> The rays (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Batoidei)</span><span class="font0"> together with the sharks </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Selachoidei)</span><span class="font0"> form the suborder </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Plagio stomi</span><span class="font0"> of Elasmo-branch fishes, and are divided into six families (see Ichthyology).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first family, Pristidae, contains only the saw-fishes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pristis),</span><span class="font0"> of which five species are known, from tropical and sub-tropical seas. They frequent especially estuaries and river-mouths,&nbsp;and in some cases make their way&nbsp;over a hundred miles from the&nbsp;sea. Although saw-fishes possess&nbsp;all the essential characteristics of&nbsp;the rays proper, they retain the&nbsp;elongate form of the body of&nbsp;sharks, the tail being excessively&nbsp;muscular and the sole organ of&nbsp;locomotion. The “ saw ” (fig. 1)&nbsp;is a flat prolongation of the snout,&nbsp;with an endoskeleton which con-sists of three to five cartilaginous&nbsp;tubes; these are the rostral processes of the cranial cartilage and&nbsp;are found in all rays, though commonly much shorter. The integument&nbsp; of the saw is hard,&nbsp;covered with shagreen; and a&nbsp;series of strong teeth, sharp in&nbsp;front and flat&nbsp;behind, are embedded in it, in&nbsp;alveolar sockets,&nbsp;on each side.&nbsp;The saw is a formidable weapon&nbsp;of offence, by&nbsp;means of which&nbsp;the fish tears&nbsp;pieces of flesh&nbsp;off the body of&nbsp;its victim, or&nbsp;rips open its&nbsp;abdomen to feed&nbsp;on the intestines. The teeth&nbsp;proper, with&nbsp;which the mouth&nbsp;is armed, are&nbsp;extremely small&nbsp;and obtuse, and&nbsp;unsuitable for&nbsp;wounding&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">seizing animals. Saw-fishes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">abundant in the tropics; in their stomachs pieces of intestines and fragments&nbsp;of cuttle-fish have been found. They grow to a large size,&nbsp;specimens with saws 6 ft. long and 1 ft. broad at the base being&nbsp;common.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The rays of the second family, Rhinobatidae, bear a strong resemblance to the saw-fishes, but lack the saw. Their teeth are&nbsp;consequently more developed, flat, obtuse, and adapted for&nbsp;crushing hard-shelled marine animals. There are about twenty&nbsp;known species, from tropical and subtropical seas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The third family, Torpedinidae, includes the electric rays. For the peculiar organ (fig. 2) by which the electricity is produced, see Ichthyology. The fish uses this power voluntarily&nbsp;either to defend itself or to stun or kill the smaller animals on</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which it feeds. To receive the shock, the object must complete the galvanic circuit by communicating with the fish at two&nbsp;distinct points, either directly or through the medium of some&nbsp;conducting body. The electric currents created in these fishes&nbsp;exercise all the other known powers of electricity: they render&nbsp;the needle magnetic, decompose chemical compounds and emit&nbsp;the spark. The dorsal surface of the electric organ is positive,&nbsp;the ventral negative. Shocks from a large healthy fish will&nbsp;temporarily paralyse the arms of a strong man. The species of&nbsp;the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Torpedo</span><span class="font0"> are distributed over the coasts of the Atlantic,&nbsp;Pacific and Indian Ocean, and at least one reaches the coasts of&nbsp;Great Britain (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">T.</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hebetans).</span><span class="font0"> On the west coast of North&nbsp;America </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">T. californica</span><span class="font0"> occurs, while on the Atlantic coast there&nbsp;is found the black crampfish </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(T. occidentalis).</span><span class="font0"> This latter is said&nbsp;to reach a weight of 200 ℔, but such gigantic specimens&nbsp;are scarce, and prefer sandy ground at some distance from the&nbsp;shore, where they are not disturbed by the agitation of the&nbsp;surface-water. Seven genera with about fifteen species have&nbsp;been described, mostly from the warmer seas. All the rays of&nbsp;this family have, like electric fishes generally, a smooth and naked&nbsp;body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fourth family, Raiidae, comprises the skates and rays proper, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Raiα.</span><span class="font0"> More than thirty species are known, chiefly&nbsp;from the temperate seas of both hemispheres, but much more&nbsp;numerously from the northern than the southern. A few species&nbsp;descend to a depth of nearly 600 fathoms, without, however,&nbsp;essentially differing from their surface congeners.
