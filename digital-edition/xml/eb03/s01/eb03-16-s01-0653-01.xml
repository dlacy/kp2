in botany: A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the octandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking with thoſe of which the order is doubtful. The calyx is ſuperior; the corolla monopetalous; the ſtamina placed in the tube; the ſtigma is ſimple; the fruit a berry.</p><p>The ſantalum, or ſanders, grows to the ſize of a walnut-tree. Its leaves are entire, oval, and placed oppoſite to each other. Its flower is of one ſingle piece, charged with eight ſtamina, and ſupported upon the piſtil, which becomes an inſipid berry, reſembling in form that of the laurel. Its wood is white in the circumference, and yellow in the centre when the tree is old. This difference of colour conſtitutes two kinds of ſanders, both employed for the ſame purpoſes, and having equally a bitter taſte, and an aromatic ſmell. With the powder of this wood a paſte is prepared, with which the Chineſe, Indians, Perſians, Arabians, and Turks, anoint their bodies. It is likewiſe burnt in their houſes, and yields a fragrant and wholeſome ſmell. The greateſt quantity of this wood, to which a ſharp and attenuating virtue is aſcribed, remains in Tndia. The red ſanders, though in leſs eſtimation, and leſs generally uſed, is ſent by preference into Europe. This is the produce of a different tree, which is common on the coaſt of Coromandel. Some travellers confound it with the wood of Caliatour, which is uſed in dyeing.</p><p>The ſantalum album, or white ſanders, is brought from the Eaſt Indies in billets about the thickneſs of a man’s leg, of a pale whitiſh colour. It is that part of the yellow ſanders wood which lies next the bark. Great part of it, as met with in the ſhops, has no ſmell or taſte, nor any ſenſible quality that can recommend it to the notice of the phyſician.</p><p>The ſantalum album, or yellow ſanders, is the interior part of the wood of the ſame tree which furniſhes the former, is of a pale yellowiſh colour, of a pleaſant ſmell, and a bitteriſh aromatic taſte, accompanied with an agreeable kind of pungency This elegant wood might undoubtedly be applied to valuable medical pur</p><p>poſes, though at preſent very rarely uſed. Diſtilled with water, it yields a fragrant eſſential oil, which thickens in the cold into the conſiſtence of a balſam. Digeſted in pure ſpirit, it imparts a rich yellow tincture; which being committed to diſtillation, the ſpirit ariſes without bringing over any thing conſiderable of the flavour of the ſanders. The reſiduum contains the virtues of ſix times its weight of the wood. Hoffman looks upon this extract as a medicine of ſimilar virtues to ambergris; and recommends it as an excellent reſtorative in great debilities.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
