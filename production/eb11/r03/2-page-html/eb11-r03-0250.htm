<p><span class="font0">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the position of Christianity was assured by the&nbsp;failure of Julian<sup>i</sup>S reaction, it was evident that profession of&nbsp;that religion would henceforward be a necessary qualification&nbsp;for election to the throne. This was formally and constitutionally recognized when the coronation of the emperor by the&nbsp;patriarch was introduced in 457, or perhaps in 450.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sovereignty of the emperor was personal and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">not&nbsp;territorial.</span><span class="font0"> In this respect it always retained the character&nbsp;which it had inherited as the offspring of a Roman magistracy.&nbsp;Hence no Roman territory could be granted by the emperor to&nbsp;another power. For instance, the Western emperor Conrad III.&nbsp;could promise to hand over Italy to Manuel Comnenus as the&nbsp;dowry of his wife, but it would have been constitutionally&nbsp;illegal for Manuel to have made such a promise to any foreign&nbsp;prince; an Eastern emperor had no right to dispose of the&nbsp;territory of the state. Tendencies towards a territorial conception begin indeed to appear (partly under Western influence) in&nbsp;the time of the Palaeologi, especially in the custom of bestowing&nbsp;appanages on imperial princes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the senate of Rome generally lost its importance&nbsp;and at last became a mere municipal body, the new senate of&nbsp;Constantine preserved its position as an organ of the state till&nbsp;the fall of Constantinople. For the imperial elections it was&nbsp;constitutionally indispensable, and it was able sometimes to&nbsp;play a decisive part when the throne was vacant—its only&nbsp;opportunity for independent action. The abolition, under&nbsp;Diocletian’s system, of the senatorial provinces deprived the&nbsp;senate of the chief administrative function which it exercised&nbsp;under the Prindpate; it had no legislative powers; and it lost&nbsp;most of its judicial functions. It was, however, still a judicial&nbsp;court; it tried, for instance, political crimes. In composition&nbsp;it differed from the senate of the Principate. The senators in&nbsp;the 4th century were chiefly functionaries in the public service,&nbsp;divided into the three ascending ranks of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Claris simi, Spectabilcs.&nbsp;illustres.</span><span class="font0"> The majority of the members of the senatorial order&nbsp;lived in the provinces, forming a provincial aristocracy, and&nbsp;did not sit in the senate. Then the two lower ranks ceased to&nbsp;have a right to sit in the senate, which was confined to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">illustres</span><span class="font0"> and men of higher rank (Patricians). The senatorial&nbsp;order must therefore be distinguished from the senate in a&nbsp;narrower sense; the latter finally consisted mainly of high&nbsp;ministers of state and the chief officials of the palace. It would&nbsp;be a grave mistake to underrate the importance of this body,&nbsp;through an irrelevant contrast with the senate of the Republic&nbsp;or even of the Principate. Its composition ensured to it great&nbsp;influence as a consultative assembly; and its political weight&nbsp;was increased by the fact that the inner council of imperial&nbsp;advisers was practically a committee of the senate. The importance of the senate is illustrated by the fact that in the nth&nbsp;century Constantine X., in order to carry out a revolutionary,&nbsp;anti-military policy, found it necessary to alter the composition&nbsp;of the senate by introducing a number of new men from the&nbsp;lower classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The memory of the power which had once belonged to&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">populus Romanus</span><span class="font0"> lingered in the part which the inhabitants of New Rome, and their representatives, played in acclaiming newly elected emperors, and in such ceremonies&nbsp;as coronations. In the 6th century the factions (“ demes ”)&nbsp;of the circus, Blues and Greens, appear as political parties,&nbsp;distract the dty by their quarrels, and break out in serious&nbsp;riots. On one occasion they shook the throne (“ Nika ” revolt,&nbsp;532). The emperors finally quelled this clement of disturbance by giving the factions a new organization, under “ de-marchs” and “ democrats/’ and assigning them a definite&nbsp;quasi-political </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">locus standi</span><span class="font0"> in the public ceremonies in the&nbsp;palace and the capital. The duty of providing </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">panem et cir-censes</span><span class="font0"> was inherited from Old Rome; but the free distribution&nbsp;of bread cannot be traced beyond the 6th century (had the&nbsp;loss of the Egyptian granary to do with its cessation?), while&nbsp;the spectacles of the hippodrome lasted till the end. Outside&nbsp;the capital the people took little interest in politics, except&nbsp;when theology was concerned; and it may be said generally&nbsp;that it was mainly in the ecclesiastical sphere that public&nbsp;opinion among the masses, voiced by the clergy and monks,&nbsp;was an influence which made itself felt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The court ceremonial of Constantinople, which forms such a market contrast to the ostentatiously simple establishments&nbsp;of Augustus and the Antonines,.had in its origin a certain constitutional significance. It was introduced by Aurelian and Diocletian, not, we must suppose, from any personal love of display,&nbsp;but rather to dissociate the emperor from the army, at a time&nbsp;when the state had been shaken to its foundations by the predominance of the military element and the dependence of the&nbsp;emperor on the soldiers. It was the object of Diocletian to make&nbsp;him independent of all, with no more particular relation to the&nbsp;army than to any other element in the state; the royal court&nbsp;and the inaccessibility of the ruler were calculated to promote&nbsp;this object. The etiquette and ceremonies were greatly elaborated&nbsp;by Justinian, and were diligently maintained and developed.&nbsp;The public functions, which included processions through the&nbsp;streets to various sanctuaries of the dty on the great feast-days&nbsp;of the Church, supplied entertainment of which the populace&nbsp;never wearied; and it did not escape the wit of the rulers that&nbsp;the splendid functions and. solemn etiquette, of the court were an&nbsp;effective means of impressing the imagination of foreigners, who&nbsp;constantly resorted to Constantinople from neighbouring kingdoms&nbsp;and dependencies, with the majesty and power of the Basileus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The imperial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dignity</span><span class="font0"> was collegial. There could be two or more emperors </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">imperatores,</span><span class="font0"> βασιλεῑς). at the same time; edicts were&nbsp;issued, public acts performed, in their joint names. Through&nbsp;the period of dualism, in the 4th and 5th centuries, when the&nbsp;administration of the Eastern provinces was generally separate&nbsp;from that of the Western, the imperial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">authority</span><span class="font0"> was also collegial.&nbsp;But after this period the system of divided authority came to an&nbsp;end and was never renewed. There was frequently more than&nbsp;one emperor, not only in the case of a father and his sons, or of&nbsp;two brothers, but also in the case of a minority, when a regent&nbsp;is elected emperor (Romanus I.; cf. Nicfephorus II. and John&nbsp;Zimisces). But one colleague always exercised the sole authority,&nbsp;was the real monarch, the “great” or the “first” Basileus; the&nbsp;other or others were only sleeping partners. Under the Comneni&nbsp;a new nomenclature was introduced; a brother, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> who before&nbsp;could have become the formal colleague of the ruler, received the title&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sebastocrator</span><span class="font0"> (SebaStos was the Greek equivalent of Augustus).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Legislation.—</span><span class="font0">The history of the legislation of the Eastern Empire is distinguished by three epochs associated with the&nbsp;names of (1) Justinian, (2) LeoIII., (3) Basil I. and Leo VI.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Justinianean legislation (see Justinian) is thoroughly&nbsp;Roman in spirit, and inspired by pious adhesion to the traditions&nbsp;of the past; but it admitted modifications of the older law in&nbsp;accordance with tendencies which had been long since making&nbsp;themselves felt: consideration is accorded to principles of humanity&nbsp;in the laws affecting persons, and to the principle of public interest&nbsp;in the laws relating to things. Justinian not only sanctioned&nbsp;changes which time had brought about, like the mitigation of the&nbsp;strict </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font0"> and the greater independence of wives, but&nbsp;introduced a revolutionary change in the law of succession to&nbsp;property, abolishing inheritance by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">agnatio </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">qt</span><span class="font0"> relationship through&nbsp;males, and substituting inheritance by blood relationship whether&nbsp;through males or females.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Justinian’s reign was followed by a period in which Juristic&nbsp;studies decayed. The seventh century, in which social order was&nbsp;profoundly disturbed, is a blank in legal history, and it would seem&nbsp;that the law of Justinian, though it had been rendered into Greek,&nbsp;almost ceased to be studied or understood. Practice at least was&nbsp;modified by principles in accord with the public opinion of Christian&nbsp;society and influenced by ecclesiastical canons. In a synod held&nbsp;at Constantinople in the reign of Justinian II. numerous rules&nbsp;were enacted, differing from the existing laws and based on ecclesiastical doctrine and Alosaic principles, and these were sanctioned&nbsp;as laws of the realm by the emperor. Thus Church influence&nbsp;and the decline of Roman tradition, in a state which had become&nbsp;predominantly Greek, determined the character of the ensuing&nbsp;legislative epoch under the auspices of Leo III., whose law book&nbsp;(a.d. 740), written in Greek, marks a new era and Teflectsthechanged&nbsp;ideas of the community. Entitled a “ Brief Selection of Laws ”&nbsp;and generally known as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ecloga,</span><span class="font0"> it may be described as a&nbsp;Christian law book. In regard to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font0"> increased&nbsp;facilities are given for emancipation from paternal control when&nbsp;the son comes to years of discretion, and the paternal is to a certain&nbsp;extent replaced by a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">parental</span><span class="font0"> control over minors. The. law of&nbsp;guardianship is considerably modified. The laws of marriage are&nbsp;transformed under the influence of the Christian, conception of&nbsp;matrimony; the institution of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Concubinatus</span><span class="font0"> is abolished. Impedi--ments to marriage on account of consanguinity and of spiritual&nbsp;relationship are multiplied. While Justinian regarded marriage&nbsp;as a contract, and therefore, like any other contract, dissoluble&nbsp;at the pleasure of the parties, Leo III. accepted the Church view&nbsp;that it was an indissoluble bond. Ecclesiastical influence is written</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
