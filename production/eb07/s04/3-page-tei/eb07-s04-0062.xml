France and Britain had acknowledged Queen Isabella II. These two powers, along with Portugal, entered into a treaty with Spain, the conditions of which quadruple alliance were, that France should watch the fron tiers, so that the insurgents might receive no aid from that country ; that Britain should supply such arms and munitions of war as the Spanish government should stand in need of, whilst at the same time she should guard the northem ports of Spain, so as to prevent the insurgents from receiving any assistance in men, money, or ammunition, and also assist the queen with a naval force ; and that Portugal should cooperate by every means in her power : but that country was at the time in too embarrassed a situation to render any efficient assistance. As soon as the arrival of Don Carlos in Navarre was known, the four powers who had been parties to the treaty renewed its stipulations, in respect that its object had not yet been attained. This imparted confidence and vigour to the cabinet of Madrid, of which it stood greatly in need. A variety of measures occupied the attention of government during the year 1834, not the least important of which was the plan of a new charter or constitution. It is quite unnecessary to enter into any details of what the Cortes proposed should be done, as every thing was overturned and put upon a new footing by a revolution which occurred two years afterwards. The financial state of Spain, particularly the large debt which the government owed to foreign nations, formed a subject of protracted discussion. Doubts were raised as to whether a part of it was legitimately owing; but the debates in the Cortes terminated in the whole being recognised as justly due. This contributed to restore the credit of Spain in foreign money-markets, where it had been greatly shaken, and enabled the government to contract for a new loan. Another measure of importance which engaged the attention of the Cortes, was the passing of a bill of exclusion from the throne against Carlos and his descendants. During the year the ministry had undergone a complete change, chiefly through the instrumentality of a popular leader of the name of Llauder. Zea was superseded in the office of prime minister by Martinez de la Rosa, supposed to be a person of more liberal predilections.</p><p>The military operations of 1835 were prosecuted with great vigour on the part of the Carlists. Several import ant towns and fortresses fell into their hands, and siege was laid to Bilboa, the capital of Biscay. After sustaining a furious bombardment for several days, the place was re lieved, principally through the instrumentality of some British gunners under Lord John Hay, commander of a ship of war then on the coast of Biscay. It was during the attack on Bilboa that Zumalacarreguy received the wound of which he died on the 23d of June. The death of this chief threw a gloom on the affairs of Don Carlos ; it was the severest loss which his cause had sustained, and he never properly repaired it. Among the Christines this event diffused a joy and hope which they made no efforts to conceal. Worn out by long service, by age, and by dis ease, the veteran Mina resigned the command, which ultimately devolved upon General Cordova, under whom was the celebrated Espartero. The Spanish government having been permitted to levy a body of mercenaries in Great Britain, several thousand recruits were raised in this country, and were led to the theatre of war in Spain under the command of General Evans. The British legion soon took an active part in the war, and distinguished itself upon various occasions. The Carlist army, although it abandoned</p><p>the siege of Bilboa, still continued in the neighbour hood, prepared to take advantage of circumstances. An opportunity soon occurred for attacking the Christinos at the village of Arrigoriaga, which they made an attempt to pass. The royalists were driven back with considerable loss, and this check for the time interrupted the movements of Cordova’s army. On the other hand, the Christinos laid claim to more than one victory gained over their enemies ; but these doubtful and unproductive skirmishes, which in the flush and enthusiasm of triumph were magnified into decisive battles, are too insignificant to require a detail in this place. At the close of 1835, matters stood much as they did at the commencement of the year. But the war was now carried on with more humanity than formerly. A strong remonstrance on the part of the British government, against the barbarous practice of putting prisoners to death, had the desired effect, at least for a time, of staying the effusion of blood in this inhuman manner.</p><p>Those parts of Spain exempt from the horrors of war, were for the most part subjected to the scourge of political anarchy. The new government of the queen-regent had been founded on an abandonment of the old system of un mitigated despotism. Her daughter’s throne was to be identified with more liberal institutions, and was thus to be protected by all political reformers, all who were inimical to absolutism. But the extent to which the old system was to be abandoned, and the form in which a popular government was to be established, were questions regarding which every possible diversity of opinion prevailed. The un quiet elements thus at work showed themselves first in a military revolt, and then in the revolt of several provinces, in which the democratic party sought to usurp the powers of government. For a time they set the lawful authorities at defiance, for the government of Madrid was helpless. Even here disaffection had spread to a most alarming ex tent, the urban militia having openly revolted. In vain were royal decrees issued, and strong measures put in force to repress the disturbances ; an open war between the government and numerous sections of the liberals seemed on the eve of breaking out. Fortunately this was averted by a change of the ministry, which was loudly demanded by the factious opposition. The life and soul of the new ministry was Mendizabel, a man of great vigour, and very popular among the people, on account of his liberal prin ciples. He condemned the repressive measures which had been acted upon, adopted a more lenient system of dealing with the malcontents, and proposed various alterations in the constitution, the mere mention of which sufficed to restore the country to comparative tranquillity. But all the deliberations of the ministry and the Cortes were rendered abortive by the military revolution which broke out at Malaga on the 25th of July 1836. The object of the ultra liberals had uniformly been the restoration of the constitution of 1812. Without this no change of ministers could satisfy them, and no vigilance on the part of government could prevent them from covertly prosecuting their designs. It was with the national guard that the revolt originated. In Malaga the governor was assassinated, and a junta was appointed to proclaim the constitution. Intelligence of these events spread throughout the country with the greatest rapidity. Cadiz and Saragossa took up the signal nearly at the same moment ; and they were instantly followed by Seville, Cordova, Granada, and Valencia. At length the capital itself joined the insurgent cities ; and on the l3th of August the queen, now deserted and helpless, was compelled to issue a decree, promising the restoration of the constitution of 1812. But all men who were reasonable and honest in their politics felt and admitted that some alterations in that code were quite indispensable. The Cortes accordingly appointed a committee to consider and propose</p></body></text></TEI>
