<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">duties on this planet, a new culture and new intellectual perceptions penetrating every sphere of thought and energy,&nbsp;it also involved new reciprocal relations between the members of the European group of nations. The Renaissance&nbsp;closed the Middle Ages and opened the modern era,—not&nbsp;merely because the mental and moral ideas which then&nbsp;sprang into activity and owed their force in large measure&nbsp;to the revival of classical learning were opposed to mediaeval&nbsp;modes of thinking and feeling, but also because the political and international relations specific to it as an age&nbsp;were at variance with fundamental theories of the past.&nbsp;Instead of empire and church, the sun and moon of the&nbsp;mediaeval system, a federation of peoples, separate in type&nbsp;and divergent in interests, yet bound together by common&nbsp;tendencies, common culture, and common efforts, came&nbsp;into existence. For obedience to central authority was&nbsp;substituted balance of power. Henceforth the hegemony&nbsp;of Europe attached to no crown imperial or papal, but to&nbsp;the nation which was capable of winning it, in the spiritual&nbsp;region by mental ascendency, and in the temporal by force.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">That this is the right way of regarding the subject appears from the events of the first two decades of the&nbsp;16th century, those years in which the humanistic revival&nbsp;attained its highest point in Italy. Luther published his&nbsp;i theses in 1517, sixty-four years after the fall of Constantinople, twenty-three years after the expedition of Charles&nbsp;VIII. to Naples, ten years before the sack of Rome, at a&nbsp;moment when France, Spain, and England had only felt&nbsp;the influences of Italian culture but feebly. From that&nbsp;date forward two parties wrestled for supremacy in Europe,&nbsp;to which may be given the familiar names of Liberalism&nbsp;and Conservatism, the party of progress and the party of&nbsp;established institutions. The triumph of the former was&nbsp;most signal among the Teutonic peoples. The Latin races,&nbsp;championed by Spain and supported by the Papacy, fought&nbsp;the battle of the latter, and succeeded for a time in rolling</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">back the tide of revolutionary conquest. !Meanwhile that . liberal culture which had been created for Europe by the&nbsp;Italians before the contest of the Reformation began continued to spread, although it was stifled in Italy and Spain,&nbsp;retarded in France and the Low Countries, well nigh extirpated by wars in Germany, and diverted from its course in&nbsp;England by the counter-movement of Puritanism. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">auto da f'es</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Seville and Madrid, the flames to which&nbsp;Bruno, Dolet, and Paleario ■were flung, the dungeon of&nbsp;Campanella and the seclusion of Galileo, the massacre of St&nbsp;Bartholomew and the faggots of Smithfield, the desolated&nbsp;plains of Germany and the cruelties of Alva in the Netherlands, disillusioned Europe of those golden dreams which&nbsp;had arisen in the earlier days of humanism, and which had&nbsp;been so pleasantly indulged by Rabelais. In truth the Renaissance was ruled by no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Astræa redux,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> but rather by a&nbsp;severe spirit which brought not peace but a sword, reminding men of sternest duties, testing what of moral force and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">j </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">tenacity was in them, compelling them to strike for the old&nbsp;order or the new, suffering no lukewarm halting between&nbsp;two opinions. That, in spite of retardation and retrogression, the old order of ideas should have yielded to the&nbsp;new all over Europe,—that science should have won firm&nbsp;standing-ground, and political liberty should have struggled&nbsp;through those birth-throes of its origin,—was in the nature&nbsp;of things. Had this not been, the Renaissance or re-birth&nbsp;of Europe would be a term without a meaning.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Literature</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The special articles on the several arts and the literatures of modern Europe, and on the biographies of great men&nbsp;mentioned in this essay, will give details of necessity here omitted.&nbsp;It may be useful to indicate a few works upon the Renaissance in&nbsp;| general.

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RENAIX, a manufacturing town of Belgium, in the province of East Flanders, eight miles by rail south of&nbsp;Oudenarde, with a communal population of 14,089 in&nbsp;1876. It contains the ruins of a castle built in 1638 by&nbsp;Count John of Nassau-Siegen, and a church with the tomb&nbsp;of St Hermes, to whom it is dedicated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RÉNAUDOT, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Eusèbe </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1646-1720), theologian and Orientalist, was born in Paris in 1646, and was educated&nbsp;for the church. Notwithstanding his taste for theology&nbsp;and his title of abbé, he never took orders, and much of&nbsp;his life was spent at the French court, where he attracted&nbsp;the notice of Colbert and was often employed in confidential affairs. The unusual learning in Eastern tongues&nbsp;which he had acquired in his youth and continued to&nbsp;maintain amidst the distractions of court life did not bear&nbsp;fruit till he was sixty-two years old. His best-known&nbsp;books, which are still valuable, are the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jlistoria Patri-archarum Alexandrinorum</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (Paris, 1713), and the collection&nbsp;of Eastern liturgies (2 vols., 1715-16). The latter ·work&nbsp;was designed to supply proofs of the “perpetuity of the&nbsp;faith” of the church on the subject of the sacraments, the&nbsp;topic about which most of his theological writings turned,&nbsp;and which was then, in consequence of the controversies&nbsp;attaching to Arnauld’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perpétuité de la Foi,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> a burning one&nbsp;between French Catholics and Protestants. Rénaudot was&nbsp;not a very fair controversialist, but his learning and&nbsp;industry are unquestionable, and his piety shone the more&nbsp;brightly that it did not withdraw itself from contact with&nbsp;the world. He died in 1720.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RENDSBURG, a town of Prussia, in the province of Schleswig-Holstein, is situated on the Eider, in a flat and&nbsp;sandy district, 20 miles to the west of Kiel. It consists of&nbsp;three parts :—the crowded Altstadt, on an island in the&nbsp;Eider; the Neuwerk, on the south bank of the river; and&nbsp;the Kronwerk, on the north bank. Rendsburg is the chief&nbsp;jilace in the basin of the Eider, and when in the possession&nbsp;of Denmark was maintained as a strong fortress, guarding&nbsp;the approach to the Cimbric peninsula. Its present importance, however, rests on the commercial facilities afforded by&nbsp;its connexion with the North Sea and the Baltic through&nbsp;the Eider and the Eider Canal, by which a brisk transit&nbsp;trade is carried on in grain, timber, Swedish iron, and coals.&nbsp;The principal industries are cotton-weaving, tanning, and&nbsp;the manufacture of artificial manures ; and there is a large&nbsp;iron foundry in the immediate neighbourhood. The population in 1880 was 12,776, including a strong garrison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The town of Rendsburg came into existence under the shelter of a castle founded by the Danes about the year 1100 on an island&nbsp;of the Eider, and was at first an object of dispute between the&nbsp;Danish kings and the counts of Holstein. In 1252 it was finally&nbsp;adjudged to the latter, and it has since shared their fortunes. The&nbsp;town was surrounded with ramparts in 1539, but the important&nbsp;fortifications of the Kronwerk were not constructed till the end of&nbsp;the 17th century. During the Thirty Years’ War Rendsburg was&nbsp;taken both by the Imperialists and the Swedes, but in 1645 it&nbsp;successfully resisted a second siege by the latter. The war of&nbsp;1848-50 began with the capture of Rendsburg by the Holsteiners&nbsp;by a </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">coup de main,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and it formed the centre of the German operations. On the departure of the German troops in 1852 the Danes&nbsp;at once set to work to demolish the fortifications.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RENÉ I. (1409-1480), duke of Anjou, count of Provence, and titular king of Naples, was the second son&nbsp;of Louis II. of Aragon, king of Naples, and Yolande,&nbsp;daughter of John I. of Aragon, and was born 16th</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
