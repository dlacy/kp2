(Paul), was born at Rome in 1687. He was the ſon of an architect, and a pupil of the celebrated Gravina, who inſpired him with a taſte for learning and poetry. An intelligent and learned Engliſh lord having brought him to London, introduced him to the royal family as a maſter of the Tuſcan language. Rolli remained in England till the death of queen Caroline his protector, and the patroneſs of literature in general.

<p>peaτed in London in 1735, in 8vo. They conſiſt of odes in blank verſe, elegies, ſongs, and other things, after the manner of Catullus. There is likewiſe, by him, a Collection of Epigrams, printed at Florence in 1776, in 8vo, and preceded with his life by the abbé Fondini. What Martial ſaid of his own Collection may be ſaid of this, “ That there are few good, but many indifferent or bad, pieces in it.” Rolli, however, bore the character of one of the beſt Italian poets of his age. During his ſtay in London, he procured editions of ſeveral authors, of his own country. The principal of theſe were, the Satires of Arioſto, the Burleſque Works of Berni, Varchi, 8tc. 2 vols, in 8vo, which poſſeſs conſiderable merit. The Decameron of Boccace, 1727, in 4t0 and folio; in which he has faithfully copied the celebrated and valuable edition publiſhed by the <hi rend="italic">ſſantes</hi> in ι Ç27 : and, laſtly, of the elegant Lucretia of Marchetti, which, after the manuſcript was reviſed, was printed at London in 1 717, in Svo, through the influence and attention of Rolli. This edition is beautiful ; but the work is thought of pernicious tendency. There are likewiſe, by him, tranſlations into Italian verſe of the Paradiſe Loſt of Milton, printed at London in folio in 1735’ ; and of the Odes of Anacreon, London 1739, in 8vo.</p>
