                <p><label>SĀNCHI</label>, a small village in India, at which there is now a railway
                    station on the Bombay-Baroda line. It is famous as the site of what are almost
                    certainly the oldest buildings in India now standing. They are Buddhist topes
                    (Pali. <hi rend="italic">thūpa∙,</hi> Sanskrit, <hi rend="italic">stupa),</hi>
                    that is, memorial mounds, standing on the level top of a small sandstone hill
                    about 300 ft. high on the left bank of the river Betwa. The number of topes on
                    this and the adjoining hills is considerable. On the Sānchi hill itself are only
                    ten, but one of these is by far the most important and imposing of all. All
                    these topes were opened and examined by General Alexander Cunningham and
                    Lieut.-Colonel Maisey in 1851; and the great tope has been described and
                    illustrated by them and by James Fergusson. This is a solid dome of stone, about
                    103 ft. in diameter, and now about 42 ft. high. It must formerly have been much
                    higher, the top of the tope having originally formed a terrace, 34 ft. in
                    diameter, on which stood lofty columns. Cunningham estimates the original height
                    of the building as about 1oo ft. Round the base is a flagged pathway surrounded
                    by a stone railing and entered at the four points of the compass by, gateways
                    some 18 ft. high. Both gateways and railing are elaborately covered with
                    bas-reliefs and inscriptions. The latter give the names of the donors of
                    particular portions of the architectural ornamentation, and most of them are
                    written in the characters used before and after the time of Asoka in the middle
                    of the 3rd century b.c. The monuments arc Buddhist, the bas-reliefs illustrate
                    passages in the Buddhist writings, and the inscriptions make use of Buddhist
                    technical terms. Some of the smaller topes give us names of men who lived in the
                    Buddha’s time, and others give names mentioned among the missionaries sent out
                    in the time of Asoka. It is not possible from the available data to fix the
                    exact date of any of these topes, but it may be stated that the smaller topes
                    are probably of different dates both before and after Asoka, and that it is very
                    possible that the largest was one of three which we are told was erected by
                    Asoka himself. The monuments at Sãnchi are now under the charge of the
                    archaeological department; they arc being well cared for, and valuable
                    photographs have been taken of the bas-reliefs and inscriptions. The drawings in
                    Fergusson's work entitled <hi rend="italic">Tree and Serpent Worship</hi> are
                    very unsatisfactory, and his suggestion that the carvings illustrate tree and
                    serpent worship is quite erroneous.</p>
