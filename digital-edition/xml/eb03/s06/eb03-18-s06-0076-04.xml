the evening repart.— Suppers that are heavy ſhould be avoided, becauſe the ſtomach is more oppressed with the ſame quantity of food in an horizontal poſture than in an erect one, and because digeſtion goes on more slowly when we ſleep than when we are awake.

church, than this ſacrament ; and though all confeſs that one purpoſe of its inſtitution was to be a bond of love and union among Chriſtians, it has, by the perverſeneſs of mankind, been too often converted into an occaſion of hatred. The outward and visible fign, and the inward and ſpiritual grace, have equally afforded matter of diſputation to angry controvertiſts. Many members of the church of Rome condemn the Greek church and the Proteſtants for using leavened bread in the Lord’s Supper, contrary to the example ſet them by our Saviour ; whilſt the Greek church in general, and ſome Proteſtant ſocieties in particular, unite with the church of Rome in cenſuring all churches which mix not the wine with water, as deviating improperly from primitive practice. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Eucharist.</hi></p><p>That it was unleavened bread which our Lord blessed and brake and gave to bis diſciples as his body, cannot be queſtioned ; for at the time of the passover, when this ordinance was inſtituted, there was no leavened bread to be found in Jeruſalem<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Exod. xii. 15, 19.</p></note> *. For the mixed cup, the evidence is not ſo deciſive. It is indeed true, as we have obſerved under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Eucharist,</hi> that the primitive Chriſtians uſed wine diluted with water ; and if we may believe Maimonides<note anchored="true" n="2" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* In Mishnam.</p></note> *, it was the general cuſtom of the Jews, as well at the paſſover as at their ordinary meals, to add a little water to their wine on account of its great ſtrength ; but that this was <hi rend="italic">always</hi> done, or that it was done by our <hi rend="italic">Saviour in particular,</hi> there is no clear evidence. Origen indeed affirms<note anchored="true" n="3" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Hom. 12. in Hieremism.</p></note> *, that our Lord adminiſtered in wine unmixed ; and he was not a man to hazard ſuch an affirmation, had there been in his days any certain tradition, or ſo much as a general opinion, to the contrary. On this account we have often heard with wonder the neceſſity of the mixed cup inſiſted on by thoſe who without hesitation make uſe of leavened bread ; for if it be essential to the ſacrament that the very ſame elements be employed by us that were employed by our Saviour, the neceſſity of unleavened bread is certainly equal to that of wine diluted by water.</p><p>But the mixed cup is ſaid to be emblematical of the blood and water which flowed from the side of our Lord when pierced by the ſpear of the Roman ſoldier, while the abſence of leaven is emblematical of no particular circumstance in His paſſion. This argument for the mixture is as old as the era of St Cyprian, and has ſince been frequently urged with triumph by thoſe who ſurely perceived not its weakneſs. The flowing of the blood and water. from our Saviour’s side was the conſequence either of the ſpear’s having pierced the <hi rend="italic">pericardium,</hi> or more probably of an <hi rend="italic">aſcites</hi> or <hi rend="italic">hydrothorax,</hi> occasioned by his cruel and lingering death (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Medicine,</hi> n⁰ 342, 343.) But whatever was the cauſe of it, how can the mixing of wine with water in the ſacrament be emblematical of the flowing of blood and water ſeparately ? Such a mixture ſurely bears a more linking reſemblance to the reunion of the <hi rend="italic">ſerum</hi> and <hi rend="italic">crasſamentum,</hi> after they had been ſeparated by whatever cauſe. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Blood.</hi></p><p>We urge not theſe objections to the mixed cup from any diſlike that we have to the practice. It is unqueſtionably harmleſs and primitive ; and we wiſh that greater regard were paid to primitive practices than the generality of Chriſtians ſeem to think they can claim : but let the advocates for antiquity be consistent ; let them either reſtore, together with the mixed cup, the uſe of unleavened bread, or acknowledge that neither the one nor the other is essential to the ſacrament. This laſt acknowledgment muſt indeed be made, if they would not involve themſelves in difficulties from which they cannot be extricated. If either the mixed cup or unleavened bread be abſolutely necessary to the validity of the ſacrament, why not wine made from the grapes of Judæa ? why not that particular kind of wine which was uſed by our Saviour ? and where is that wine to be found?</p><p>But the controversies reſpecting the outward part or ſign of the Lord’s Supper are of little importance when compared with thoſe which have been agitated reſpecting the inward part or thing ſignified ; and of theſe we hasten to give as comprehenſive a view as the limits preſcribed to such articles will admit.</p><p>Our Blessed Lord, in the ſame night that he was betrayed, “ took bread, and blessed it, and brake it, and gave it to the diſciples, and ſaid, Take, eat ; this is my body. And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, Drink ye all of it; for this is my blood of the new teſtament, which is ſhed for many for the remiſſion of sins.” Such was the inſtitution of the Lord’s Supper as it is recorded in the goſpel by St Matthew ; and we have the ſame account of it, in almoſt the very ſame words, by three other inſpired writers, St Paul, St Mark, and St Luke. That it was the bread which Chriſt blessed and brake that is here called his body, and the wine over which he gave thanks that he ſtyles his blood of the new teſtament, will admit of no reaſonable doubt<note anchored="true" n="4" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> Some over-zealous Proteſtants have indeed affirmed, that it was not the conſecrated bread and wine, but thoſe elements, <hi rend="italic">together with the whole action of</hi> taking them into his hands, bleſſing them, breaking the bread, and diſtributing the bread and wine to the diſciples, that Chriſt calls his body and blood. This novel and singular opinion rests upon no better foundation than a very childiſh criticiſm. Our Saviour, after bleſſing and breaking the bread, gave it to the diſciples, saying, in the original, Λαϐειε, φαγειε TOVTO εσι το σωμα μον <hi rend="italic">.</hi> Now, ſay our critics, τoυιο, in the neuter gender, can never agree with the antecedent αριος in the maſculine, but muſt refer to all the circumſtances of the action taken together, and conſidered as one complex neuter noun. But this noun, whether complex or simple, certainly denotes what could be <hi rend="italic">eaten ;</hi> and to ſuppoſe that our blessed Lord deſired his apostles to eat actions <hi rend="italic">,</hi> is as repugnant to human reaſon as any doctrine of the church of Rome. The truth is, that the. word τoυιο, which is more properly a definite article than a demonſtrative pronoun (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Grammar,</hi> Chap. II. ), refers directly to the thing, whatever it was, which our Saviour held in his hand and gave to the diſciples ; and the clauſe, when completed, is τουίο ον εοιι το σωμα μου; this being, this subst <hi rend="italic">ance, is my body.</hi> There was no neceſſity for characteriſing that ſubſtance by any analogy to sex, in order that it might be diſtinguiſhed from every other ſubſtance ; for the apoſtles could not but see it in the hand of their; Maſter.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(a);</hi> but in what ſenſe they became ſo, has been the ſubject of many controversies.</p><p>The church of Rome, which holds·, that after conſecration, Jeſus Chriſt, God and man, is really, truly, and ſubſtantially, contained under the outward appearances of the bread and wine, informs us, that about the middle of the maſs, when the priest, taking into his hand, firſt the bread and then the wine, pronounces over each ſeparately the ſacred words of conſecration, the ſubſtance of theſe elements is immediately changed by the almighty power of God into the body and blood of Chriſt ; but that all the outward appearances of the bread and wine, and all their<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0084.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0078"/>
ſenſible qualities remain. This more than miraculous change is called <hi rend="smallcaps">transubstantiation</hi>; and is founded on the philosophy of Ariſtotle, which reſolves all bodies into <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">form</hi> (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics,</hi> n⁰ 142—150.); for it is only the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> or imperceptible ſubſtance which ſupports the <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> or ſenſible qualities of bread and wine, that is changed into the subst <hi rend="italic">ance</hi> or matter of the body and blood of Chriſt, ſo that this divine matter, coming into the place of the former earthly matter, ſupports the ſame identical <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> which it ſupported. Hence we are told, that Jeſus Chriſt, now preſent inſtead of the bread and wine, exhibits himſelf to us under thoſe very ſame outward <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> or appearances which the bread and wine had before the change.”</p><p>Could this doctrine be true, it would be abundantly mysterious ; but to add to the myſtery, we are farther informed, that under each kind is contained Jeſus Chriſt whole and entire, his body and blood, his ſoul and divinity; ſo that when a man eats what has the appearance of a wafer, he really and truly eats the body and blood, the ſoul and divinity, of Jeſus Chriſt ; and when he afterwards drinks what has the appearance of wine, he drinks the very ſame body and blood, ſoul and divinity, which not a minute perhaps before he had wholly and entirely eaten ! The ingenious author from whoſe work we have taken this account of the Romiſh doctrine concerning the real preſence, may perhaps reject our inference that the orthodox members of his church muſt believe the <hi rend="italic">ſoul</hi> and <hi rend="italic">divinity</hi> of Chriſt to be <hi rend="italic">eaten</hi> and <hi rend="italic">drunk</hi> in the Lord’s Supper ; but he cannot deny that, according to his ſtatement of the Catholic faith, the ſoul and divinity are both received whole and entire into the ſtomach of each communicant. He ſays indeed, that “ communion conſiſts in receiving Jeſus Chriſt whole and entire, his ſacred body, his precious blood, his bleſſed ſoul, and his adorable divinity, into our <hi rend="italic">ſouls ;”</hi> but that which was formerly bread and wine unqueſtionably goes into the st <hi rend="italic">omachs</hi> of the communicants ; and ſince, according to him, it is now the body and blood of Chriſt, the ſoul and divinity muſt go thither with it, for theſe four cannot be ſeparated. This our author himſelf grants. “ The Scripture (ſays he) poſitively declares, that <hi rend="italic">Christ rising again from the dead, dieth no more; death ſhall no more have dominion over him</hi> (Rom. vi. 9.) Conſequently his body, his blood, and his ſoul, ſhall never more be ſeparated from one another ; and as the union of his divine and human natures can never more be broken, ſo neither can theſe, his two natures, united in his divine perſon, be ever ſeparated. From this it neceſſarily follows, that wherever the body of Chriſt is, there alſo his blood, his ſoul, and his divinity, muſt of neceſſity be in like manner.”</p><p>Now, whether we ſuppoſe, with our author, that the soul and divinity of Chriſt directly carry his body and blood with them into the human ſoul, or, truſting in ſome degree to the evidence of ſenſe, believe that the body and blood carry the ſoul and divinity with them directly into the ſtomach of each communicant—is it credible, is it poſſible, that the high and lofty One, who inhabiteth eternity, and whom the oracles of truth aſſure us that even the heaven of heavens cannot contain, ſhould be <hi rend="italic">ſubstantially</hi> received whole and <hi rend="italic">entire</hi> into a finite ſpirit like the human ſoul, or into a body ſo limited as the human ſtomach ? Our author ſays it is ; declaring that, “ by the bleſſed <hi rend="italic">presence of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi rend="italic">whole and entire within us,</hi> are communicated to our ſouls all the heavenly graces which are the effects of the holy communion : ſuch as the ſanctification of the ſoul by an increaſe of juſtifying grace; the rendering of it more pure, more holy, more beautiful, more agreeable, in the eyes of God ; the cleanſing of the ſoul from all thoſe venial sins and imperfections of which we repent, and preſerving us from falling into mortal sins ; the uniting of us in a moſt intimate manner with Jeſus Chriſt, who comes to us in this holy ſacrament on purpoſe to dwell in our ſouls and abide with us ; and the giving us a pledge and earneſt of a glorious immortality, to the enjoyment of which it brings us at laſt, if we perſevere to the end in the grace of God.”</p><p>The conſequence of the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation is the s <hi rend="italic">acrifice of the mass,</hi> by which, it is ſaid, God’s acceptance of Chriſt’s ſacrifice on the croſs is obtained for the actual benefit of thoſe perſons in particular for whom the maſs is offered. In the work ſo often quoted, we are told, that “ Jeſus Chriſt our redeemer, who is both our high-prieſt and our victim, who, in order to perfect the work of our redemption, and reconcile man with his offended Creator, offered himſelf once in a bloody manner upon the croſs, in order to communicate and apply to the ſouls of individuals thoſe graces, which, by his death, he merited for mankind in general, continues to offer himſelf daily upon the altar in an unbloody manner, by the miniſtry of his prieſts, in the <hi rend="italic">maſs.</hi> The ſacrifice of the croſs and that of the maſs are both one and the ſame ſacrifice, becauſe in both the victim is the ſame and the high prieſt the ſame, viz. Jeſus Chriſt. The only difference is in the <hi rend="italic">manner</hi> of offering. On the croſs he offered himſelf in a bloody manner and actually died ; whereas on the altar he is offered up to God in an unbloody manner, not <hi rend="italic">actually</hi> dead, but under the <hi rend="italic">appearance</hi> of death ;” ſo that the communicants not only eat the man Jeſus Chriſt, but even eat him alive<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(b)</hi> This whole account of the Romiſh doctrine reſpecting the ſacrament of the Lord’s Supper is taken from a work in two ſmall volumes, called <hi rend="italic">The Sincere Christian instructed the Faith of Christ, from the Written Word.</hi> Its author is a man of learning, and great perſonal worth ; and as he fills a high ſtation in the church of Rome, we cannot doubt but that he has given a fair view of the doctrine of that church reſpecting this and every other article of which he treats. We are ſorry however that his zeal ſhould have impelled him, in a <hi rend="italic">popular</hi> work, to write in the manner that he has done of the ſalvation of thoſe who are not members of his church, or who cannot embrace all his opinions ; for if his doctrine on this ſubject be implicitly received by thoſe “ over whom he has the rule, and for whoſe ſouls he is appointed to watch,” they muſt neceſſarily look upon the majority of their fellow citizens as reprobates doomed to eternal perdition. Let this be our apology for treating ſome of thoſe opinions, which he thinks ſo abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation, with leſs ceremony than perhaps we ſhould have done, had he less poſitively pronounced our damnation for not having it in our power to embrace them. He is not indeed much leſs ſevere on the moſt virtuous heathens, though they never ſaw the New Teſtament, or heard the doctrines of his church preached. But perhaps this ſeverity may be occaſioned by the following queſtion of Cicero : “ Cum fruges, <hi rend="italic">Cererem ;</hi> vinum, <hi rend="italic">Liberum</hi> dicimus, genere nos quidem ſermonis utimur uſitato : sed <hi rend="smallcaps">ecquem tam amentem</hi> eſſe putas, qui illud, quo veſcatur, deum credat eſſe ?” <hi rend="italic">De Natura Deorum,</hi> Lib. 3. Cap. 16.</p></note> (B)!</p><p>It is known to all our readers that this doctrine of tranſubſtantiation was one cauſe of the breach between the church of Rome and thoſe various ſocieties which call themſelves reformed churches. The real and ſubſtantial change of the bread and wine into the body and blood of our Lord is rejected by every reformer as a change contradictory and impoſſible, and fraught with the moſt impious conſequences ; and volumes have been written to expoſe the weakneſs of thoſe arguments which have ſo often been vainly urged in its ſupport. It has been ſhown to imply numberleſs abſurdities, ſuch as, that the ſame thing can be in a million of different places, <hi rend="italic">whole</hi> and <hi rend="italic">entire,</hi> at<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0085.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0079"/>
the ſame inſtant of time ; that it is near 1800 years old, and yet may be not more than one minute ; that <hi rend="italic">forms</hi> or ſenſible qualities are real things independent of their ſubject and the ſentient beings who perceive them ; that the infinite and eternal God, who created and ſuſtains the univerſe, is himſelf wholly and ſubſtantially comprehended by the human ſoul ; and that the half, or fourth, or tenth part of the body of Chriſt, is equal to the whole of that body. That theſe are neceſſary conſequences of tranſubstantiation has been ſo completely proved in various works<note anchored="true" n="6" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Chap. vi. verse 54.</p></note> (c) to which every reader may have acceſs, that it is needless for us to repeat arguments ſo hackneyed ; but there are two objections to that doctrine, which, as we do not remember to have met with them elſewhere, and as they appear to us abſolutely concluſive, it may be worth while to ſtate in this place.</p><p>The advocates for the real preſence in the Lord’s Supper contend, that every word relating to that ordinance is to be taken in the ſtricteſt and moſt literal ſenſe, and they affect to triumph over the Proteſtants, becauſe their notions of the ſacrament cannot be ſupported without having recourſe to figure and metaphor. This however is a very vain triumph ; for we heſitate not to affirm, that ſuppoſing tranſubſtantiation poſſible, and even capable of proof, there is not in the whole New Teſtament a ſingle word or a single phraſe which, if interpreted <hi rend="italic">literally,</hi> gives the ſlighteſt countenance to that wonderful doctrine. The reader will remember, that tranſubſtantiation, as we have ſtated it from a dignitary of the Romiſh church, and as it is in fact ſtated by the council of Trent<note anchored="true" n="7" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(c) Among other works on this ſubject, we may confidently recommend to the reader a ſmall tract publiſhed by Dr Abernethy Drummend, about twenty years ago, in the form of <hi rend="italic">A Dialogue between Philalethes and Benevolus.</hi> In that treatiſe, together with a defence of it, which were both printed for Balfour and Drummond, Edinburgh, the abſurd conſequences which we have mentioned are, by arguments unanſwerable, proved to flow from the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation ; and the artful ſophiſtry, by which a very acute genius endeavoured to keep theſe conſequences out of ſight, is detected and expoſed on acknowledged principles of the ſoundeſt metaphyſics.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(d),</hi> conſiſts in a change of the <hi rend="italic">matter, imperceptible substance,</hi> or s <hi rend="italic">ubstratum</hi> of the bread and wine into the <hi rend="italic">matter, imperceptible substance,</hi> or su <hi rend="italic">bstratum</hi> of Chriſt’s body and blood ; for all parties agree that the ſenſible qualities of the bread and wine remain, and, according to the Romaniſt, are after conſeration either ſupported by the <hi rend="italic">matter of</hi> Chriſt’s body and blood, or hung upon nothing. But the phraſe <hi rend="italic">τoυιο εσιι το ϲωμα μoυ, if</hi> taken in the literal ſenſe, cannot possibly denote the conſequence of ſuch a change as this ; for every perſon at all acquainted with the Greek language, eſpecially the language of the Peripatetic school, knows that το <hi rend="italic">σωμα μoυ</hi> ſignifies, not the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> or s <hi rend="italic">ubstratum</hi> of my body diveſted of its ſenſible qualities ; but the body of me in its natural ſtate, conſiſting of <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> and <hi rend="italic">qualities,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">matter and form united.</hi> Unleſs therefore the <hi rend="italic">ſenſible qualities,</hi> as well as the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> of the bread and wine, give place to the ſenſible <hi rend="italic">qualities</hi> as well as the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> of our Saviour’s body and blood, and unleſs he appear glorified on the altar as he appeared on the mount at his transfiguration, the words το <hi rend="italic">σωμa μoυ</hi> muſt be interpreted figuratively. Had the apoſtles underſtood their Maſter’s words in the ſenſe in which they are underſtood by the church of Rome, they would have rendered them into Greek, not τoυιο εσιι <hi rend="italic">το σωμα μoυ,</hi> “ this is my <hi rend="italic">body,"</hi> but τουιο εσιι ή ύλυ <hi rend="italic">σωμαιος μου,</hi> “ this is the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> of my body.” In like manner, when St John relates<note anchored="true" n="8" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(d)</hi> The canon of that council which eſtabliſhes tranlubſtantiation is thus tranſlated by the author of <hi rend="italic">The Sincere Christian Instructed :</hi> “ If any man ſhall say, that in the bleſſed ſacrament of the Euchariſt the ſubſtance of the bread and wine remains along with the body and blood of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall deny that wonderful and ſingular converſion of the whole ſubſtance of the bread into the body, and of the whole ſubſtance of the wine into the blood, the appearances of the bread and wine only remaining, which converſion the Catholic Church calls <hi rend="italic">transubstantiation,</hi> let him be anathema.”</p></note> * that Jeſus ſaid, “ Who ſo eateth my fleſh and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day,” had he underſtood his adorable Maſter to ſpeak of his fleſh and blood in the Euchariſt in the ſenſe in which they are taught to be there by the church of Rome, he would have repreſented him as ſaying, not Ο' τpωγων <hi rend="italic">μου την σαγων,</hi> ϰαι πινων <hi rend="italic">μου το άιμα,</hi> but Ο' <hi rend="italic">τpωyωv τηv</hi> <hi rend="italic">μου τϛ σαρϰοϛ,</hi> ϰαι πινων τηv υλγγ <hi rend="italic">μου</hi> του άιμαιοϛ <hi rend="italic">,</hi> “ whoſo eateth the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> of my fleſh, and drinketh the <hi rend="italic">matter</hi> of my blood, hath eternal life, and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.”</p><p>But further, ſuppoſing this singular converſion poſſible in itſelf, it cannot be rendered credible, however ſtated in any language that ever was or ever will be ſpoken by man. At firſt light it may appear paradoxical to affirm, that a poſſible fact cannot be ſo related as to obtain credit ; but that tranſubſtantiation, if poſſible, is ſuch a fact, will be apparent on the ſlighteſt conſideration.</p><p>The relation that ſubſiſts between things and words is arbitrary ; ſo that what is termed <hi rend="italic">body</hi> in English, is <hi rend="italic">σωμα.</hi> in Greek, and <hi rend="italic">corpus</hi> in Latin ; and the ſame thing might with equal propriety (had the authors of theſe languages ſo pleaſed) have been expreſſed in the firſt by s <hi rend="italic">oul,</hi> in the second by ιουϛ, and in the third by <hi rend="italic">anima.</hi> (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Language,</hi> n⁰ 3, &amp;c. ) The conſequences of this are, that there is no univerſal language ſpoken ; that the natives of one country underſtand not the ſpeech of thoſe of another ; and that different men ſpeaking the ſame language are perpetually liable to miſtake each other’s meaning. Between the substra <hi rend="italic">ta</hi> of bodies and their <hi rend="italic">ſenſible qualities</hi> there is a relation founded in nature, ſo that the ſenſible qualities which indicate the ſubſtance to which they belong, to be <hi rend="italic">gold,</hi> for inſtance, in one country, indicate the ſame thing in every other country, and have done ſo from the beginning of time. The ſenſible appearances of bodies therefore are an univerſal language, the language of the Author of Nature, by which he declares to his creature man, that though the ύλη πρωιη, or primary matter of all bodies, may be the ſame kind of ſubſtance ; yet the προσεχηϛ of one body, or the internal combination of its primary parts, differs from that of ano-<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0086.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0080"/>
ther ; that gold, for inſtancc, has a different s <hi rend="italic">ubstratum</hi> or <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> from iron, lead, or ſilver ; that the internal organization or ſtructure of the body of an ox is different from that of a horſe ; and that the <hi rend="italic">internal substance</hi> or s <hi rend="italic">ubstratum</hi> which exhibits the appearances of bread and wine is different from that which ſupports the ſenſible qualities of fleſh and blood (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics,</hi> Part I. Chap. I. and Part II. Chap. I. and II.). Suppoſing therefore the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation to be poſſible and even true, it would ſtill be impoſſible, by any ſtatement of it in human language, or by any argument urged in its ſupport, to render that doctrine an object of rational belief ; for if it be ſaid that the words τουιο εσιι τοσωμα μου were ſpoken by a divine perſon, who could neither be deceived himſelf nor intend to deceive us, it may be replied, that the ſenſible appearances of bread and wine, which are confessed to remain, are like- wiſe the language of a divine perſon, even of the Creator and Governor of heaven and earth ; that this language addressed to the sight, the taſte, the touch, and the ſmell, is equally intelligible to all nations ; that ſince the creation of the world its meaning has never been miſtaken by the ſcholar or the clown, the ſage or the ſavage, except in this ſingle inſtance of our Lord’s fleſh and blood exhibiting the ſenſible appearances of bread and wine ; and that it is therefore infinitely more probable that the members of the church of Rome ſhould miſtake the meaning of the words τουιο εοιι <hi rend="italic">το σωμa μoυ,</hi> which, though ſpoken by Chriſt, are part of the language of men, and liable to all its ambiguities, than that all mankind ſhould miſtake the language of God himſelf, which is liable to no ambiguities, and which was never in any other inſtance misunderſtood by a ſingle individual. Should tranſubſtantiation therefore be really true, its truth can never be proved or rendered probable, but by an immediate operation of the ſpirit of God on the mind of man ; and he who is conſcious of no ſuch operation on his own mind, may rest aſſured that the Father of mercies, who knows whereof he is made, will never bring upon him, for his incredulity in this inſtance, any of the anathemas denounced by the church of Rome upon thoſe who place implicit confidence in the univerſal language of Him who created them, in oppoſition to her figurative and contradictory interpretations of the written word. Of the tranſubſtantiation of the elements a viſible miracle would afford no proof. Had the water been changed into wine at the marriage in Cana of Galilee, for the expreſs purpoſe of bearing teſtimony to this Angular converſion, what muſt have been the conſequence on the minds of thoſe who witneſſed that miracle ? Nothing, we think, but ſcepticiſm or a diſtruſt of their own faculties ; for they would have had the very ſame evidence that <hi rend="italic">no</hi> ſubſtantial change was wrought on the elements, as that the water was actually turned into wine.</p><p>Though the reformed churches unanimouſly reject the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation, and of courſe the ſacrifice of the maſs, its inſeparable conſequence, they are far from being agreed among themſelves reſpecting the nature of the Lord’s Supper ; and the notions of this ordinance entertained by ſome of them appear to us as untenable as any part of the doctrine of the church of Rome. The Lutherans believe, that the body and blood of Chriſt are really and ſubſtantially preſent with the bread and wine; that the body is really and truly eaten, and the blood really and truly drunk, by the communicants; and that whatever motion or action the bread has, the body has the same<note anchored="true" n="9" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Luther.

According to them, therefore, the ſame ſenſible appearances are exhibited by two ſubſtances united in ſome inexplicable manner, which is neither a perſonal union, nor incorporation, nor the incloſure of the body within the bread : nor does it laſt longer than while the ſacrament is celebrating. This union is generally called <hi rend="smallcaps">consubstantiation</hi>; but they reject the term, contenting themſelves with afferting the real preſence, without preſuming to define the mode by which the body and blood of Chriſt are united to the sacramental elements.</p><p>It would be ſuperfluous to waſte time in replying to this doctrine. Every reader sees that it implies the poſſibility of the ſame thing’s being whole and entire in a million of places at one and the ſame inſtant of time, which has been ſo often urged as an unanswerable objection to the Romiſh doctrine ; and it is fraught with this additional abſurdity peculiar to itſelf, that two bodily ſubſtances may at once occupy the ſame place, which is directly contrary to our notions of ſolidity. It may be obſerved too, that whatever be the real ſenſe of our Saviour’s words, he ſays expreſsly, “ This is my body”—this thing which I give you, and which you ſee and feel ; whereas, had he meant what Luther and his followers teach, he would ſurely have ſaid, <hi rend="italic">“ With</hi> this bread receive my body, <hi rend="italic">with</hi> this cup receive my blood.”</p><p>The notione of ſome of the early Calviniſts reſpecting the Lord’s Supper are very myſterious, and expressed in language of which we are not ſure that we underſtand the meaning. In the year 1561 an attempt was made in France to bring the Catholics and Proteſtants to an uniformity of doctrine on this great topic of controverſy ; and deputies were appointed by both parties to meet at <hi rend="italic">Poissy,</hi> and debate the queſtion in a friendly manner. The principal managers on the ſide of the Catholics were the cardinals of <hi rend="italic">Lorraine</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Tournon;</hi> thoſe on the side of the Proteſtants were Beza and <hi rend="italic">Peter Martyr.</hi> After ſeveral meetings, diſputes, and violent ſeparations, the Proteſtant deputies declared their faith in the following words: “We confeſs, that Jeſus Chriſt, in the Supper, does truly give and exhibit to us the ſubſtance of his body and blood by the efficacy of his Holy Spirit ; and that we do receive and eat ſpiritually, and by faith, <hi rend="italic">that very body which was offered and immolated for us,</hi> ſo as to be bone of his bone and fleſh of his fleſh, to the end that we may be enlivened thereby, and receive what is conducive to our ſalvation. And becauſe faith, ſupported by the word of God, makes thoſe things preſent, which it apprehends, and by that faith we do in <hi rend="italic">deed</hi> and <hi rend="italic">reality</hi> receive the <hi rend="italic">true natural</hi> body and blood of Chriſt, by the power of the Holy Spirit ; by this means, we confeſs and acknowledge the preſence of his body and blood in the Supper.” One of the Catholic delegates expreſſing his diſlike of this laſt clauſe, the Proteſtant miniſters gave the following explanation of their ſentiments : “ No diſtance of place can bindet us ſrom communicating of the body and blood of Chriſt, for the Lord’s Supper is a heavenly thing ; and though on earth we receive with our mouths bread and wine, which are the true ſigns of his body and blood, yet by faith, and the efficacy of the Holy Ghoſt, our minds, which are fed with this food, <hi rend="italic">are rapt up into heaven,</hi> and enjoy the preſence of the body and blood ; and that by this means it may be ſaid that the body is truly joined to the bread, and the blood to the wines but after the manner of a ſacrament, and not at all according to place or natural poſition<note anchored="true" n="10" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Thaemus, lib. 28. See also Johnson's Unbloody Sacrifice, vol 1.</p></note> *.”</p><p>If the reader can diſcover the precise meaning of theſe paſſages, his ſagacity exceeds ours. That the Proteſtant deputies believed, or professed to believe, that the <hi rend="italic">natural</hi> body and blood of Chriſt are by the faithful received in the Lord’s Supper, is indeed evident; but their notions reſpecting the manner of this reception are very unintelligible, if not contradictory. In the former quotation, they confeſs that Chriſt’s body and blood are really preſent<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0087.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0081"/>
in the ſacrament ; that they are made preſent by faith (we ſuppoſe the faith of the communicants) ; and that the <hi rend="italic">very body</hi> which was offered and immolated for us is eaten <hi rend="italic">ſpiritually</hi> and by f <hi rend="italic">aith.</hi> In the latter quotation, they ſeem to ſay that Chriſt’s body and blood are in heaven, at a great diſtance from the true ſigns of them; that on earth the communicants receive only theſe ſigns, which are bread and wine; but that, by faith and the efficacy of the Holy Spirit, their minds, during actual communion, are rapt up into heaven, where they enjoy the preſence of the body and blood; and that by this means the body and blood are truly joined to the bread and wine through the medium of the mind of the communicant, which is at once preſent both to the sign and to the thing signified. To this myſterious doctrine it is needleſs to urge objections. Every man who is accuſtomed to think, and to uſe words with ſome determinate meaning, will at once perceive that the authors of this declaration muſt have had very confuſed notions of the ſubject, and have pleaſed themſelves with ſound inſtead of ſenſe, ſatisfied that they could not be wrong if they did not ſymbolize with the Lutherans or the Council of Trent.</p><p>The churches of England and Scotland, in their eſtabliſhed doctrines reſpecting the Lord’s Supper, appear to be Calviniſtical ; but the compilers of the Thirty-nine Articles and of the Confeſſion of Faith muſt have been much more rational divines than Beza and Peter Martyr. They agree in condemning the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation as contrary to common ſenſe, and not founded in the word of God; they teach, that to ſuch as rightly, worthily, and with faith, receive the ſacrament, the bread which we break is a partaking of the body of Chriſt, and the cup of bleſſing a partaking of the blood of Chriſt ; and they add, that the body and blood of Chriſt are eaten and drunk, not corporally or carnally, but only after a heavenly and ſpiritual manner, by which the communicants are made partakers of all the benefits of his death<note anchored="true" n="11" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*Articles of the Church of England, Art. 28. and Confession of Faith, chap. 29</p></note> *. In one important circumſtance theſe two churches ſeem to differ. The Confession of Faith, as we underſtand it<note anchored="true" n="12" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Chap. 29. <unclear> p </unclear> 3.</p></note> *, affirms, that in the Lord’s Supper there is no ſacriſice made at all. The thirty-firſt article of the church of England likewiſe condemns the Popiſh ſacrifice of the maſs as a <hi rend="italic">blaſphemous fable</hi> and <hi rend="italic">dangerous deceit ;</hi> but in <hi rend="italic">the order for the administration of the Lord’s Supper or Holy Communion,</hi> the celebrator “ beſeeches God moſt mercifully to accept the alms and <hi rend="italic">oblations</hi> of the congregation,” and again “ to accept <hi rend="italic">their ſacrifice of praiſe</hi> and thankſgiving:” from which petitions many have inferred that, in the Lord’s Supper, that church offers a commemorative and euchariſtical ſacrifice. This inference ſeems not to be wholly without foundation. In the order for the adminiſtration of the Lord’s Supper, according to the form of the Book of Common Prayer ſet forth by act of parliament in the ſecond and third years of king Edward the Sixth, the elements were ſolemnly offered to God as a ſacrifice of praiſe and thankſgiving; and though the prayer containing that oblation was, at the review of the liturgy ſome years afterwards, removed from the prayer of consecration, to which it was originally joined, and placed where it now ſtands in the poſt communion ſervice ; yet the very act of parliament which authorized that alteration, calls king Edward’s “ a very godly order, agreeable to the word of God and the primitive church, and very comfortable to all good people deſiring to live in Chriſtian converſation.”</p><p>The Engliſh church, however, has not poſitively determined any thing reſpecting this great queſtion ; and whilst ſhe condemns the doctrine of the real preſence, with all its dangerous conſequences, she allows her members to entertain very different notions of this holy ordinance, and to publiſh theſe notions to the world. Accordingly, many of her moſt eminent divines<note anchored="true" n="13" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* St John x. 7.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(e)</hi> have maintained that, in the celebration of the Lord’s Supper, the elements of bread and wine are offered to God as a ſacrifice commemorative of Chriſt’s one ſacrifice for the sins of the whole world ; that theſe elements, though they undergo no ſubſtantial change, yet receive ſuch a divine virtue by the deſcent of the Holy Ghoſt, as to convey to the worthy communicant all the benefits of Chriſt’s paiſson ; that they are therefore called his body and blood, becauſe being, after their oblation, eaten and drunk in remembrance of Him, they ſupply the place oſ his body and blood in the feaſt upon his ſacrifice ; and that it is cuſtomary with our Saviour to give to any thing the name of another of which it completely ſupplies the place, as when he calls himſelf the <hi rend="italic">door</hi><note anchored="true" n="14" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Heb. xiii. 10.</p></note> <hi rend="italic">* of</hi> the ſheep, becauſe there is no entrance into the church or kingdom of God but by faith in him. They obſerve, that the Euchariſt’s being commemorative, no more hinders it from being a proper sacrifice, than the typical and figurative ſacrifices of the old law hindered them from being proper ſacrifices: for as to be a type doth not deſtroy the nature and notion of a legal sacrifice, ſo to be repreſentative and commemorative doth not deſtroy the nature of an evangelical ſacriſice. To prove that, in thc celebration of the Lord’s Supper, there is a real sacrifice offered to God as well as a ſacrament received by the communicants, they appeal to St Paul, who says expreſsly<note anchored="true" n="15" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>*1 Cor. x. 16, &amp;c.</p></note> *, that “ Chriſtians have an <hi rend="italic">altar,</hi> whereof they have no right to eat who ſerve the tabernacle,” and who by contraſting the cup of the Lord with the cup of devils, and the table of the Lord with the table of devils<note anchored="true" n="16" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(e)</hi> The archbiſhops Laud and Wake ; the biſhops Poynet, Andrews, Bull, and Patrick ; the Doctors Hickes, Grabe, and Brett ; Messrs Bingham, Johnſon, Mede, Wheatly, Scandaret, Bowyer,</p></note> * teaches plainly, that thoſe cups and thoſe tables had the ſame ſpecific nature. That the <hi rend="italic">table of devils</hi> ſpoken of by the apoſtle was the Pagan altars, and the <hi rend="italic">cap of devils</hi> the wine poured out in libations to the Pagan divinities, will admit of no diſpute ; and therefore, ſay the advocates for the euchariſtical sacrifice, the table of the Lord muſt be the Chriſtian altar, and the cup of the Lord the wine offered to God as the repreſentative of the blood of Chriſt ; otherwiſe there would not be that <hi rend="italic">abſurdity</hi> which the apoſtle ſuppoſes, in the ſame perſon drinking the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils, and partaking of the Lord’s table and the table of devils. They obſerve farther, that in all the ancient liturgies extant there is a ſolemn form oſ oblation of the ſacramental elements, and that all the Chriſtian writers from the ſecond century downwards treat of the Lord’s Supper as a sacrifice as well as ſacrificial feaſt, having indeed no value in itſelf, but acceptable to God as repreſenting Chriſt’s one sacrifice ſor the sins of the world. Our limits will not permit us to give even an abſtract of their arguments ; but the reader who ſhall attentively peruſe Jo <hi rend="italic">hnſon’s unbloody Sacrifice and Altar unveiled and ſupported,</hi> will discover that their notions are better founded than probably he ſuppoſes, and that they are totally irreconcileable with the doctrine of tranſubſtantiation and the Popiſh sacrifice of the <hi rend="italic">maſs.</hi></p><p>Other Engliſh divines of great learning, with the celebrated Hoadley biſhop of Wincheſter at the head of them, contend ſtrenuouſly that the Lord’s Supper, ſo far from<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0088.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0082"/>
being a sacrifice of any kind, is nothing more than bread and wine reverently eaten and drunk, in remembrance that Chriſt’s body was broken and his blood ſhed in proof of his Father’s and his own love to mankind ; that nothing is essential to the ſacrament but this remembrance, and a ſerious deſire to honour and obey our Saviour as our head; that the ſacrament might be celebrated without uttering one prayer or thankſgiving, merely by a ſociety of Chriſtians, whether ſmall or great, jointly eating bread and drinking wine with a ſerious remembrance of Chriſt’s death ; that St Paul enjoins a man to examine himself before he eat of that bread and drink of that cup, not to diſcover what have been the sins of his paſt life in order to repent of them, but only that he may be ſure of his remembering Chriſt’s body broken and his blood ſhed ; that, however, it is his duty in that as in every other inſtance of religious worſhip to reſolve to obey from the heart every precept of the goſpel, whether moral or poſitive ; and that to partake worthily of the Lord’s Supper is acceptable to God, becauſe it is paying obedience to one of theſe precepts ; but that no particular benefits or privileges are annexed to it more than to any other inſtance of duty. Biſhop Hoadley acknowledges, that when St Paul says<note anchored="true" n="17" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* 1. Cor. 1. 16.</p></note> *, “ The cup of bleſſing which we bleſs, is it not the communion of the blood of Chriſt ? The bread which we break, is it not the communion of the body of Chriſt ?” he has been ſuppoſed by many learned men to affirm, that all the benefits of Chriſt’s paſſion are in the Lord’s Supper conveyed to the worthy communicant ; but this (says he) is an idea which the apoſtle could not have in his thoughts as at all proper for his argument. The Greek word ϰοινωνια and the Engliſh <hi rend="italic">communion</hi> signify only a partaking of ſomething in common with others of the ſame ſociety ; and the apoſtle’s meaning (he ſays) can be nothing more, than that in the Lord’s Supper we do not eat bread and drink wine as at an ordinary meal, but as memorials of the body and blood of Chriſt, in honour to <hi rend="italic">him</hi> as the <hi rend="italic">head</hi> of that body of which we are all <hi rend="italic">members.</hi> That the word ϰοινωνια is not meant to denote any inward or ſpiritual part of the Lord’s Supper, he thinks evident, becauſe the ſame word is uſed with regard to the cup and the table of idols, where no ſpiritual part could be thought of, and in an argument which ſuppoſes an idol to be nothing<note anchored="true" n="18" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* A Plain Account of the Nature and End of the Lord's Supper.</p></note> *.</p><p>To this view of the nature and end of the Lord’s Supper, it muſt appear no ſmall objection, that “ he who eateth and drinketh unworthily is ſaid to be <hi rend="italic">guilty of the body and blood of the Lord, and to eat and drink a judgement to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lord's body.”</hi> No doubt it would be ſinful to eat and drink a mere memorial of Chriſt’s death without ſerious diſpoſitions ; but we cannot conceive how a little wandering of the thoughts, which is all the unworthineſs which the author thinks there can be on ſuch an occaſion, ſhould be a sin of ſo deep a dye as to be properly compared with the guilt of thoſe who murdered the Lord of life. Other divines therefore, feeling the force of this and ſimilar objections, ſteer a middle courſe between the mere memorialiſt and the advocate for a real sacrifice in the holy Euchariſt, and insiſt that this rite, though no sacrifice itſelf, is yet a ſeaſt upon the one ſacrifice offered by Chriſt and ſlain upon the croſs. The moſt eminent patrons of this opinion have been Dr Cudworth, biſhop Warburton, and the preſent biſhop of Cheſter ; and they ſupport it by ſuch arguments as the following : “ In thoſe ages of the world when victims made so great a part of the religion both of Jews and Gentiles, the sacrifice was always followed by a religious feaſting on the thing offered ; which was called the feast upon, <hi rend="italic">or after the sacrifice,</hi> and was ſuppoſed to convey to the partakers of it the benefits of the sacrifice. Now Jeſus (ſay they), about to offer himſelf a sacrifice on the croſs for our redemption, did, in conſormity to general practice, inſtitute the <hi rend="italic">last ſupper,</hi> under the idea of <hi rend="italic">a feast after the ſacrifice ;</hi> and the circumſtances attending its inſtitution were ſuch, they think, that the apoſtles could not poſſibly miſtake his meaning. It was just before his paſſion, and while he was eating the paſchal ſupper, which was a Jewiſh f <hi rend="italic">east upon the sacrifice,</hi> that our blessed Lord inſtituted this rite ; and as it was his general cuſtom to allude, in his actions and expreſſions, to what paſſed before his eyes, or preſented itſelf to his obſervation, who can doubt, when, in the very form of celebration, we see all the marks of a <hi rend="italic">ſacrificial ſupper,</hi> but that the divine inſtitutor intended it ſhould bear the ſame relation to his <hi rend="italic">ſacrifice on the croſs</hi> which the <hi rend="italic">paſchal ſupper</hi> then celebrating bore to the oblation of the <hi rend="italic">paſchal lamb ?</hi> If this was not his purpoſe, and if nothing more was intended than a general memorial of a dead benefactor, why was this inſtant of time preferred for the inſtitution to all others throughout the courſe of his miniſtry, any one of which would have been equally commodious ? Indeed any other time would have been more commodious for the inſtitution of a mere memorial ; for the paſchal lamb and unleavened bread were certainly a ſacrifice ; and the words uſed by our Saviour, when he gave the bread and wine to the apoſtles, were ſuch as muſt neceſſarily have led them to conſider that bread and wine as bearing the same relation to his sacrifice that the paſchal ſupper bore to the paſchal sacrifice. At that Jewiſh ſeaſt, it was the cuſtom of every father of a family to break the unleavened bread, and to give to every gueſt a portion, saying∙, “ This is the bread of affliction, which our fathers did eat in the land of Egypt :” a cuſtom which, we may be ſure, that Chriſt, as father of his family, would religiouſly obſerve. The apoſtles knew well that they were not eating the identical bread which their fathers did eat in Egypt, but the feaſt upon the sacrifice then offered in commemoration of their redemption from Egyptian bondage ; and therefore when they saw their Master after ſupper break the bread again and give it to each of them, with theſe remarkable words, “ This is my body which is given for you, do this in remembrance of me,” they muſt have concluded, that his meaning was to inſtitute a rite which ſhould to the end of the world bear the ſame relation to his sacrifice that the paſchal ſupper bore to the sacrifice oſ the paſſover.</p><p>This inference, from the circumſtances attending the inſtitution, biſhop Warburton thinks confirmed by St Paul’s mode of arguing with the Corinthians, on their impiety and abſurdity in partaking both of the Lord’s table and the table of devils ; for “ what (ſays he) had the eaters of the ſacrifices to do with the partakers of the bread and wine in the Lord’s Supper, if the Lord’s Supper was not a feaſt of the ſame kind with their feaſts ? If the three feaſts, Jewiſh, Pagan, and Chriſtian, bad not one common nature, how could the apoſtle have inferred that this intercommunity was inconſiſtent ? Y <hi rend="italic">e</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">cannot</hi> (says he) <hi rend="italic">drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of devils ; ye</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">cannot</hi> <hi rend="italic">be partakers of the Lord's table and the table of devils.</hi> For though there might be <hi rend="italic">impiety</hi> in the promiſcuous uſe of Pagan and Chriſtian rites oſ any kind, yet the <hi rend="italic">inconſistency</hi> ariſes from their having a common nature, and consequently, as they had oppoſite originals, from their deſtroying one another’s effects in the very celebration. Sacrifices, and feaſts upon ſacrifices, were univerſally conſidered as fe <hi rend="italic">deral</hi> rites ; and therefore the Lord’s table and the table of devils being both <hi rend="italic">federal</hi> rites, the ſame man could no more<pb facs="gri_33125011196348_0089.tif" xml:id="eb03-18-s06-0083"/>
be partaker of both, than he could at once engage to ſerve both God and the devil. This is the apoſtle’s argument to the wiſe men, to whom he appeals ; and we ſee that it turns altogether upon this poſtulatum,that the Chriſtian and Pagan feaſts had the ſame ſpecific nature, or were both feaſts upon ſacrifices. If this be admitted, it is eaſy to ſee why St Paul deemed thoſe who ate and drank unworthily guilty of the body and blood of the Lord ; for if the Lord’s Supper be a feaſt upon his sacrifice, it muſt have been conſidered as the means of conveying to the communicants all the benefits of his death and paſſion ; and the profanation of ſuch a rite, by rendering his death ineffectual, might be fitly compared and juſtly equalled to the enormous guilt of thoſe by whom his blood was ſhed.” In reply to biſhop Hoadley’s remarks upon the word ϰοινωνια his brother biſhop obſerves, that “had the apoſtle meant what the learned writer makes him to mean, he would doubtless have ſaid ϰοινωνια <hi rend="italic">το σωμα,</hi> 'your communion in the body—your eating it jointly.’ St Paul (continues he) knew how to expreſs himſelf properly, as appears from a paſſage in his epiſtle to the Phillippians, where, profeſſedly ſpeaking of the joint participation of a bleſſing, he uſes theſe words, ϰοινωνια ύμωv εις το ευαγγελιον, 'your communion in the goſpel.’ To the other remark, that no ſpiritual part could be thought of in the table of idols, becauſe an idol is ſaid by the apoſtle to be <hi rend="italic">nothing,</hi> biſhop Warburton replies, “ that by St Paul the Gentiles are ſaid to have ſacrificed to devils, and thoſe who are of ſuch ſacrifices to have had communion with devils : now the <hi rend="italic">devil</hi> (continues his Lordſhip) was in St Paul’s opinion s <hi rend="italic">omething.''</hi> But the inference which the apoſtle draws from the acknowledged truth, that the cup of bleſſing which we bleſs is the communion of the blood of Chriſt, and the bread which we break the communion of the body of Chriſt, puts his meaning, our author thinks, beyond all doubt. He ſays<note anchored="true" n="19" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* 1 Cor. x. 17.</p></note> *, that the partaking of one bread makes the receivers of <hi rend="italic">many</hi> to become <hi rend="italic">one body.</hi> A just inference, if this rite be of the nature of a <hi rend="italic">feast upon the sacrifice ;</hi> for then <hi rend="italic">the communion of the body and blood of Chriſt</hi> unites the receivers into one body by an equal diſtribution of one common benefit. But if it be only a general commemoration of a deceaſed benefactor, it leaves the receivers as it found them, not <hi rend="italic">one body,</hi> but <hi rend="italic">many separate professors</hi> of one common faith.</p><p>Thus have we given ſuch a view as our limits would permit us to give, of the principal opinions that have been held respecting the nature and end of the Lord’s Supper. It is an ordinance which ſeems not to be generally underſtood ; though, being intended to ſhow forth the Lord’s death till he come, it is ſurely of sufficient importance to engage the attention of every ſerious Chriſtian. The moſt conſiderable Proteſtant divines who have expreſsly written upon it are, Johnſon in his <hi rend="italic">Unbloody Sacrifice ;</hi> Cudworth in his <hi rend="italic">Discourse concerning the true Nature of the Lord's Supper ;</hi> Hoadley in his <hi rend="italic">Plain Account ;</hi> and Warburton in his <hi rend="italic">Rational Account.</hi> The notions of Cudworth and Warburton are the ſame, and perhaps they differ not ſo much from thoſe of Johnſon as many readers ſeem to imagine. At any rate, the arguments by which Warburton ſupports his doctrine muſt have ſome force, since it is ſaid that Hoadley himſelf acknowledged they would be unanſwerable, if it could be proved that the death of Chriſt was a real sacrifice.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
