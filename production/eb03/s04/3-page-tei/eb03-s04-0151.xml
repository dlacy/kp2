The regular ſolids are thoſe terminated by regular and equal planes, and are only five in number, viz. the tetrahedron, which conſiſts of four equal triangles ; the cube or hexahedron, of six equal ſquares ; the octahedron, of eight equal triangles ; the dodecahedron, of twelve ; and the icoſihedron, of twenty equal triangles.</p><p>The irregular ſolids are almoſt infinite, comprehending all ſuch as do not come under the definition of regular ſolids ; as the ſphere, cylinder, cone, parallelogram, priſm, parallelopiped, &amp;c.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Solids,</hi> in anatomy, are the bones, ligaments, membranes, muſeles, nerves and veſſels, &amp;c.</p><p>The ſolid parts of the body, though equally compoſed of veſſels, are different with regard to their conſiſtence ; ſome being hard and others ſoft. The hard, as the bones and cartilages, give firmneſs and attitude to the body, and ſuſtain the other parts : the ſoft parts, either alone or together with the hard, ſerve to execute the animal functions. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Anatomy.</hi></p><p>SOLIDAGO, in botany : A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">ſyngenesia,</hi> and to the order of po<hi rend="italic">lygamia ſuperflua ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem ranging under the 49th order, <hi rend="italic">Compositae.</hi> The receptacle is naked ; the pappus simple ; the radii are commonly five ; the ſcales of the calyx are imbricated and curved inward. There are 14 ſpecies ; ſempervirens, canadenſis, altiſſima, lateriflora, bſeolor, lanceolata, cœsia, mexicana, flexicaulis, latifolia, virgaurea, minuta, rigida, noveboracenſis. Among theſe there is only one ſpecies, which is a native of Britain, the <hi rend="italic">virgaurea,</hi> or golden rod, which grows frequently in rough mountainous paſtures and woods. The ſtems are branched, and vary from six inches to five feet high, but their common height is about a yard. The leaves are a little hard and rough to the touch ; the lower ones oval-lanceolate, generally a little ſerrated and ſupported on footſtalks ; thoſe on the ſtalks are elliptical ; the flowers are yellow, and grow in ſpikes from the alæ of the leaves ; the ſcales of the calyx are lanceolate, of unequal length, and of a pale green colour ; the female florets in the rays are from five to eight in number; the hermaphrodite flowers in the diſc from ten to twelve. There is a variety of this ſpecies called <hi rend="italic">cambrica</hi> to be found on rocks from six inches to a foot high.</p><p>SOLIDITY, that property of matter, or body, by which it excludes all other bodies from the place which itſelf poſſeſſes ; and as it would be absurd to ſuppoſe that two bodies could poſſeſs one and the ſame place at the ſame time, it follows, that the ſofteſt bodies are equally ſolid with the hardeſt. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics, </hi>n⁰ 44. 173. &amp;c.</p><p>Among geometricians, the ſolidity of a body denotes the quantity or ſpace contained in it, and is called alſo its ſolid content.</p><p>The iolidity of a cube, priſm, cylinder, or parallelo- piped, is had by multiplying its baſis into its height. The ſolidity of a pyramid or cone is had by mul</p><p>tiplying either the whole baſe into a third part of the height, or the whole height into a third part of the baſe.</p><p>SOLILOQUY, a reaſoning or diſcourſe which a man holds with himſelf ; or, more properly, according to Papias, it is a diſcourſe by way of anſwer to a question that a man propoſes to himſelf.</p><p>Soliloquies are become very common on the modern ſtage ; yet nothing can be more inartificial, or more unnatural, than an actor’s making long ſpeeches to himſelf, to convey his intentions to the audience. Where ſuch diſcoveries are neceſſary to be made, the poet ſhould rather take care to give the dramatic persons ſuch confidants as may necessarily ſhare their inmoſt thoughts ; by which means they will be more naturally conveyed to the audience ; yet even this is a ſhift which an accurate poet would not have occasion for. The following lines of the duke of Buckingham concerning the uſe and abuſe of ſoliloquies deserve attention :</p><p>Soliloquies had need be very few,</p><p>Extremely ſhort, and ſpoke in paſſion too.</p><p>Our lovers talking to themſelves, for want</p><p>Of others, make the pit their confidant :</p><p>Nor is the matter mended yet, if thus</p><p>They truſt a friend, only to tell it us.</p><p>SOLIMAN II. emperor of the Turks, ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Magnificent,</hi> was the only ſon of Selim I. whom he ſucceeded in 1520. He was educated in a manner very different from the Ottoman princes in general; for he was inſtructed in the maxims of politics and the ſecrets of government. He began his reign by reſtoring thoſe persons their poſſeſſions whom his father had unjuſtly plundered. He re-eſtabliſhed the authority of the tribunals, which was almoſt annihilated, and beſtowed the government of provinces upon none but perſons of wealth and probity : “ I would have my viceroys (he uſed to ſay) reſemble thoſe rivers that fertilize the fields through which they paſs, not thoſe torrents which ſweep every thing before them.”</p><p>After concluding a truce with Iſmael Sophy of Perſia, and subduing Gozeli Bey, who had raiſed a rebellion in Syria, he turned his arms againſt Europe. Belgrade was taken in 1521, and Rhodes fell into his hands the year following, after an obſtinate and enthuſiaſtic defence. In 1526 he defeated and flew the king of Hungary in the famous battle of Mohatz. Three years after he conquered Buda, and immediately laid siege to Vienna itſelf. But after continuing 20 days before that city, and aſſaulting it 20 times, he was obliged to retreat with the loss of 80,000 men. Some time after he was defeated by the Perſians, and diſappointed in his hopes of taking Malta. He ſucceeded, however, in diſpoſſeſſing the Genoeſe of Chio, an iſland which had belonged to that republic for more than 200 years.</p><p>He died at the age of 76, while he was beſieging Sigeth, a town in Hungary, on the 30th Auguſt 1566.</p><p>He was a prince of the ſtricteſt probity, a lover of justice, and vigorous in the execution of it ; but he tarniſhed all his glory by the cruelty of his diſpoſition. After the battle of Mohatz he ordered 1500 priſoners, moſt of them gentlemen, to be ranged in a circle, and beheaded in preſence of his whole army.</p></body></text></TEI>
