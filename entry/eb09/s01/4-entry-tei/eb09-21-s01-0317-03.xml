chief town and headquarters of the above district, is situated in 17° 41' 25" N. lat. and 74° 2' 10" E. long., immediately below a remarkably strong hill fort on the summit of a small, steep, rocky hill. It takes its name from the seventeen walls, towers, and gates which the Sátára fort was supposed to possess. With a height of 2320 feet above sea-level, Sátára is about 60 miles from the coast, and 69 miles south of Poona. Since the death of the last raja in 1848 the population has considerably decreased; still Sátára contained in 1881 some 28,601 inhabitants (14,558 males and 14,043 females).</p></div></body></text></TEI>
