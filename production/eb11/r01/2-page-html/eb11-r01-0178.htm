<p><span class="font1">of land is not peculiar to the pre-Conquest or any other period. It runs through the whole of English history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The elements of feudalism so far existed in England under the Anglo-Saxon and Danish kings as to make it easy to introduce&nbsp;it in full at the Norman Conquest. What the Norman Conquest&nbsp;did was not to change all at once allodial into feudal tenure, but to&nbsp;complete the association of territorial with personal dependence&nbsp;in a state of society already prepared for it.@@<sup>1</sup> “ Nulle terre sans&nbsp;seigneur ” was one of the fundamental axioms of feudalism.&nbsp;There might be any number of infeudations and subinfeudations&nbsp;to mesne lords, but the chain of seigniory was complete, depending in the last resort upon the king as lord paramount. Land&nbsp;was not owned by free owners owing only necessary militia duties&nbsp;to the state, but was held of the king by military service of a&nbsp;more onerous nature. The folkland became the king’s land;&nbsp;the soldier was a landowner instead of the landowner being a&nbsp;soldier. Free owners tended to become tenants of the lord, the&nbsp;township to be lost in the manor.@@<sup>2</sup> The common land became&nbsp;in law the waste of the manor, its enjoyment resting upon a&nbsp;presumed grant by the lord. On the other hand, the whole&nbsp;of England did not become manorial; the conflict between the&nbsp;township and the manor resulted in a compromise, the result of&nbsp;which affects English tenure to this day. But it was a compromise much to the advantage of the privileged class, for in&nbsp;England more than in any other country the land law is the law&nbsp;of the nobility and not of the people. One reason of this is that,&nbsp;as England was never so completely feudalized as were some of&nbsp;the European continental states, the burden of feudalism was not&nbsp;so severely felt, and has led to less agitation for reform.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The land forfeited to the Conqueror was regranted by him to be held by military service due to the king, not to the mesne&nbsp;lord as in European continental feudalism. In 1086 at the&nbsp;council of Salisbury all the landholders swore fealty to the crown.&nbsp;In the full vigour of feudalism the inhabitants of England were&nbsp;either free or not free. The free inhabitants held their lands&nbsp;either by free tenure (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">liberum tenementum,</span><span class="font1"> franktenement) or&nbsp;by a tenure which was originally that of a non-free inhabitant,&nbsp;but attached to land in the possession of a free man. Franktenement was either military tenure, called also tenure in knight&nbsp;service or chivalry (including barony, the highest tenure known&nbsp;to the law, grand serjeanty and the special forms of escuage,&nbsp;castle-guard, cornage and others) or socage (including burgage&nbsp;and petit serjeanty), or frankalmoign (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">libera eleemosyna) or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">divine service, by which ecclesiastical corporations generally&nbsp;held their land.@@<sup>3</sup> The non-free inhabitants were in Domesday&nbsp;Book </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">servi, cotarii</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bordarli,</span><span class="font1"> later </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nativi</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">villani,</span><span class="font1"> the last&nbsp;name being applied to both free men and serfs. All these were&nbsp;in a more or less dependent condition. The free tenures all exist&nbsp;at the present day, though, as will appear later, the military&nbsp;tenures have shrunk into the unimportant and exceptional&nbsp;tenure of grand serjeanty. The non-free tenures are to a certain&nbsp;extent represented by copyhold. The most important difference&nbsp;hetween the military and socage tenures was the mode of descent.&nbsp;Whether or not a feudal benefice was originally hereditary, it had&nbsp;certainly become so at the time of the Conquest, and it descended&nbsp;to the eldest son. This applied at once in England to land held&nbsp;by military service as far as regarded the capital fief. The descent&nbsp;of socage lands or lands other than the capital fief for some time&nbsp;followed the old pre-Conquest rule of descent. Thus in the so-called “ Laws of Henry I.” the lands other than the capital fief,&nbsp;and in Glanvill, who wrote in the time of Henry II., socage lands,&nbsp;if anciently partible (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">antiquitus divisum),</span><span class="font1"> were divided among all&nbsp;the sons equally. But by the time of Bracton (Henry III.) the&nbsp;course of descent of lands held by military service had so far</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">prevailed that, though it was a question of fact whether the land was partible or not, if there was no evidence either way descent&nbsp;to the eldest son was presumed. Relics of the old custom still&nbsp;remain in the case of gavelkind. The military tenant was sub-ject to the feudal incidents, from which the tenant in socage&nbsp;was exempt. These incidents, especially wardship and marriage,&nbsp;were often oppressive.. Alienation of lands by will, except in a&nbsp;few favoured districts, became impossible; alienation </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter&nbsp;vivos</span><span class="font1"> was restrained in one direction in the interests of the heir,&nbsp;in another in the interests of the lord. At the time of Glanvill&nbsp;a tenant had a greater power of alienation over land which he had&nbsp;purchased (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">terra acquietata)</span><span class="font1"> than over land which he had inherited. But by the time of Bracton the heir had ceased to have&nbsp;any interest in either kind of land. The lords were more success-ful. It was enacted by Magna Carta that a free man should not&nbsp;give or sell so much of his land as to leave an amount insufficient&nbsp;to perform his services to his lord. In spite of this provision, the&nbsp;rights of the lords were continually diminished by subinfeuda-tion until the passing of the Statute of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quia Emptores.</span><span class="font1"> Alienation by a tenant in chief of the crown without licence was a&nbsp;ground of forfeiture until 1 Edw. III. st. 2, c. 12, by which a fine&nbsp;was substituted. The modes of conveyance at this time were&nbsp;only two, feoffment with livery of seisin for corporeal heredita-ments, grant for incorporeal hereditaments. Livery of seisin,&nbsp;though public, was not officially recorded like the old English&nbsp;transfer of property. The influence of local custom upon the&nbsp;land law must have become weakened after the circuits of the&nbsp;judges of the King’s Court were established by Henry II.&nbsp;Jurisdiction over litigation touching the freehold was taken away&nbsp;from the lord’s courts by 15 Ric. II. c. 12.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The common law as far as it dealt with real estate had in the main assumed its present aspect by the reign of Henry III. The&nbsp;changes which have been made since that date have been&nbsp;chiefly due to the action of equity and legislation, the latter&nbsp;sometimes interpreted by the courts in a manner very different&nbsp;from the intention of parliament. The most important influence&nbsp;of equity has been exercised in mortgage and trusts in the&nbsp;doctrine of specific performance of contracts concerning real&nbsp;estate, and in relief from forfeiture for breach of covenant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of Real Estate Legislation.—</span><span class="font1">The reign of Edward I. is notable for three leading statutes, all passed in the interests&nbsp;of the superior lords. The Statute of Mortmain (7 Edw. I.&nbsp;st. 2, c. 13) is the first of a long series directed against the&nbsp;acquisition of land by religious and charitable corporations. The&nbsp;statute </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Donis Conditionalibus</span><span class="font1"> (13 Edw. I. c. 1) forbade&nbsp;the alienation of estates granted to a man and the heirs of his&nbsp;body, which before the statute became on the birth of an heir&nbsp;at once alienable (except in the case of gifts in frankmarriage),&nbsp;and so the lord lost his escheat. The statute </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Quia Emptores&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(18 Edw. I. c. 1) preserved those rights of the lords which were&nbsp;up to that time subject to be defeated by subinfeudation, by&nbsp;enacting that in any alienation of lands the alienee should hold&nbsp;them of the same lord of the fee as the alienor.@@4 Since 1290 it&nbsp;has been impossible to create an estate in fee-simple to be held&nbsp;of a mesne lord, or to reserve a rent upon a grant of an estate in&nbsp;fee (unless in the form of a rent-charge), or to create a new&nbsp;manor. The statute, however, does not bind the crown. The&nbsp;practical effect of the statute was to make the transfer of land&nbsp;thenceforward more of a commercial and less of a feudal transaction. The writ of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">elegit</span><span class="font1"> was introduced by the Statute of&nbsp;Westminster II. in 1285 as a creditor’s remedy over reaI estate.&nbsp;It has, however, been considerably modified by subsequent&nbsp;legislation. From 1290 to the reign of Henry VIII., there is no&nbsp;statute of the first importance dealing with real estate. The&nbsp;reign of Henry VIII., like the reign of Edward I., is signalized&nbsp;by three acts, the effects of which continue to this day. The&nbsp;one which has had the most lasting influence in law is the&nbsp;Statute of Uses, 27 Hen. VIII. c. 10 (see Conveyancing; Trust).&nbsp;The Statute of Uses was intended to provide against secrecy of&nbsp;sales of land, and as a necessary sequel to it an act of the same</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
