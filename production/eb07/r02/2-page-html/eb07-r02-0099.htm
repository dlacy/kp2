<p><span class="font1">No writer ever exercised so great an influence over the public mind, or led to so much conscious or unconscious&nbsp;imitation. His influence on Italy, France, and Germany,&nbsp;we shall afterwards have occasion to notice. On the literature of Great Britain, we believe it to have exerted on the&nbsp;whole a most beneficial effect; not, indeed, that any professed imitation of his manner has yet appeared, which possesses&nbsp;great claims to genius, but that he has carried a higher spirit into novel writing; taught us how the simple feelings of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">i</span><span class="font1">&gt;easants, and the homely pathos of humble life, and the re-entings of feeling amongst the outcasts of society, might be made to blend with scenes of high imagination ; that his writings are calculated to strengthen the ties of our co mmon humanity ; that they never tend to foster a bad, or to throw&nbsp;ridicule upon a good or generous feeling ; while, speaking of&nbsp;them in a merely literary point of view, they taught lessons&nbsp;of simplicity, good taste, moderation, and skill in seizing the&nbsp;best points both of character and description, which have&nbsp;not been without their effect even on those by whom the&nbsp;mere manner of Scott, or his choice of subjects, have been&nbsp;studiously avoided.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The professed imitators of Scott have been numerous, but not successful. As usual, they have magnified his defects, urging his conventional personages, such as dwarfs, fools,&nbsp;gypsies, and bores, into caricature ; multiplying instead of&nbsp;retrenching those similes which, even in the original, were&nbsp;so obtrusively frequent, as to remind us of Bayes’ rule&nbsp;for writing dialogue, “ ever make a simile when you are surprised ;” and overlaying the plot with minute descriptions&nbsp;of dress and scenery, which the reader, after a little experience, is wise enough to avoid. In reading them we are&nbsp;constantly reminded of Boileau’s description of a tedious&nbsp;poetical landscape painter :</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">S'il rencontre un palais il m<sup>,</sup>en décrit la face Il me promene apres de terrasse en terrasse,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Je saute vingt feuillets pour en trouver la fin,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Et je me sauve a peine au travers du jardin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The best imitation of Sir Walter Scott’s manner with which we are acquainted is the anonymous romance of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Forman,</span><span class="font1"> of which he speaks with respect in his criticism on Mrs.&nbsp;Radcliffe. The romances of Mr. James, too, though not indicating much depth, are pleasing, always written with good&nbsp;feeling, and with a plot which excites a sort of quiet interest,&nbsp;if it does not keep the mind in the chain of curiosity or suspense. The novels of Cooper, who is probably better known&nbsp;than any other of the imitators of Scott, seem to be considerably overrated. On shipboard, or on an Indian heath, he is&nbsp;striking and picturesque ; but among civilized society, and,&nbsp;above all, in his attempts to catch the ease of fashion, we&nbsp;must regard him as singularly unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A strange contrast to the spirit of Scott’s novels was exhibited in the sceptical and dreary tone of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anastasius. </span><span class="font1">Without force of character-painting, with much languor in&nbsp;parts, and too prolonged a detail of heartlessness and vil-lany, the work fascinates by its strength, and towards the&nbsp;close, when the character ofthe hero deepens, by its irresistible pathos. Commencing with the levity of a Greek Gil&nbsp;Blas, it modulates into a key of sadness and desolation of&nbsp;spirit, which reminds us ofthe close of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">St. Leon.</span><span class="font1"> Fiction has&nbsp;few pictures which will bear comparison with that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Anastasias,</span><span class="font1"> sitting on the steps of the lazaretto of Trieste, with his&nbsp;dying boy in his arms ; and the whole conclusion of the romance, the sudden meeting and silent partingwithSpiridion,&nbsp;the journey towards the north, the dream, the warning voice,&nbsp;which, in the dusky light of daybreak, tells him he has not far&nbsp;to go; the hopelessness, the resignation of his death, all leave</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">on the mind that profound impression of the mutability and nothingness of existence, which Wordsworth has described:</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So fades, so languishes, grows dim and dies,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All that this world is proud of. From their spheres The stars of human glory are cast down,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perish the roses and the flowers of kings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is not our intention to pursue this sketch through the works of our living ornaments of the literature of fiction, or of&nbsp;some who have recently been taken from amongst us. We&nbsp;shall merely notice, that among those who have struck out&nbsp;an independent path for themselves, are the author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Valerius</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adam Blair,</span><span class="font1"> works of conspicuous originality,&nbsp;particularly the first, in which the difficult task of imparting&nbsp;a deep interest to a classical subject is performed with complete success ; the author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Trials of Margaret Lindsay,</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life,</span><span class="font1"> who,&nbsp;with the finest feeling of the dignity and poetry which lie&nbsp;within the humble rural life of Scotland, has performed for&nbsp;its more pathetic and elevated aspect, what Galt, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Annals of the Parish,</span><span class="font1"> and his other tales, has done for its&nbsp;humours and its vulgarities ; the authoress of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marriage,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Inheritance,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Destiny,</span><span class="font1"> and Sir E. L. Bulwer, who&nbsp;has given proof of very versatile ability, in a series of romances widely differing in character, from the levity of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pelham</span><span class="font1"> down to the earnestness of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Maltravers,</span><span class="font1"> but the best&nbsp;of which we think his more matured taste and judgment&nbsp;may yet surpass.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">No country has produced more novelists than Italy ; but the Italian novel bears little analogy to what we understand&nbsp;by the term. Their novels were, in fact, originally prose&nbsp;versions of the same short tales, sometimes heroic, but more&nbsp;frequently turning on themes of gallantry or comic adventure, which formed the favourite subjects of the Trouveres.&nbsp;They were Fabliaux translated into Italian ; and this character they retained for five centuries from Boccaccio to&nbsp;Gozzi. (1313—1786.) The incidents are generally briefly&nbsp;given; there is little development of character or sentiment;&nbsp;or, where these are found, they exhibit rather separate scenes&nbsp;from life than any thing having the interest of a compact&nbsp;whole. But if the incidents and characters have little development, the Italian novelists have indemnified themselves&nbsp;for this confinement, by indulging in the utmost license of&nbsp;a pompous, circuitous, and unmeaning style. The facile&nbsp;beauty of the Italian language, “ Che spande di </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">parlar</span><span class="font1"> si&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">largo</span><span class="font1"> frame,’’has been the bane of their novelists. Boccaccio,&nbsp;the first and by far the greatest of the Italian novelists, indeed manages to impart to it a sort of garrulous grace ; but&nbsp;in the hands of his imitators the contrast between the poverty of the idea and the rich garb of words with which it&nbsp;is invested, assumes a ludicrous effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Never, perhaps, among so many novelists, was there so little of novelty. Instead of imitating nature, their avowed&nbsp;principle was to imitate Boccaccio, who, imparting to every&nbsp;thing a soft and rose-coloured glow, was himself not remarkable for the closeness of his adherence to it. And hence&nbsp;regarding the novel merely as a theme upon which they&nbsp;were to display all the brilliant variations of which the&nbsp;music of Italian speech was susceptible, they were contented&nbsp;to repeat in a great measure the same themes, to borrow,&nbsp;with a sort of easy impudence, their incidents from Boccaccio&nbsp;or from each other ; and more anxious for the purity of&nbsp;their Tuscan than of their tales, of which by far the greater&nbsp;number turn on scenes of licentiousness or low humour,&nbsp;they seemed to think all other merits in the novel subordinate to that of being “ written in very choice Italian.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Beyond the limits of Italy, Bandello (1554) and Cintio (whose </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hecatommithi</span><span class="font1"> appeared in 1565,) are almost the&nbsp;only novelists whose names are known to foreigners, if we&nbsp;except the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Belphegαr</span><span class="font1"> of the versatile Macchiavelli ; and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
