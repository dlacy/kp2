For temperatures above the boiling point, the part of the syphon under E is evidently superfluous, merely containing in its two legs a useless weight of equipoised mercury. Accordingly, for high heats, the apparatus, Figs. 16 or 17, is employed, and the same method of proce</p><p>dure is adopted ; the ap</p><p>erture at O, Fig. 17, ad</p><p>mits the bulb of the ther</p><p>mometer, which rests as</p><p>usual on <hi rend="italic">l'.</hi> The recur</p><p>ved part of the tube is</p><p>filled with mercury, and</p><p>then a little liquid is</p><p>passed through it to the</p><p>sealed end. Heat is now</p><p>applied by an argand</p><p>flame to the bottom of</p><p>C, which is filled with oil</p><p>or water, and the tem</p><p>perature is kept steadily</p><p>at 212° for some mi</p><p>nutes. Then a few drops</p><p>of quicksilver may be re</p><p>quired to be added to D',</p><p>till L and <hi rend="italic">l'</hi> be in the</p><p>same horizontal plane.</p><p>The further conduct of</p><p>the experiment differs in</p><p>no respect from what has</p><p>been already described—</p><p>the liquid in C is progressively heated, and at each stage mercury is progressively added over L to restore the initial level or volume at <hi rend="italic">l',</hi> by equipoising the progressive elas ticity. The column above L being measured, represents the succession of elastic forces: when this column is wished to extend very high, the vertical tube requires to be placed for support in the groove of a long wooden prism.</p><p>“ The height of the column in some of my experiments being nearly twelve feet, it became necessary to employ a ladder to reach its top. I found it to be convenient, in this case, after observing that the column of vapour had attained its primitive magnitude, to note down the temperature with the altitude of the column, then immediately to pour in a measured quantity of mercury nearly equal to three vertical inches, and to wait till the slow progress of the heating again brought the vapour in equilibrio with this new pressure, which at first had pushed the mercury within the platina ring at <hi rend="italic">l.</hi> When the lower surface of the mercury was again a tangent to this ring, the temperature and altitude were both instantly observed.</p><p>“ This mode of conducting the process will account for the experimental temperatures being very often odd and fractional numbers. I present them to the public, as they were recorded on the instant in that particular repetition of the experiment which I consider most entitled to confidence. To trim and fashion the results into an orderly looking series, would have been an easy task ; but, in my opinion, this is a species of deception very injurious to the cause of science, and a deviation from the rigid truth of observation, which ought never to be made for any hypo thesis : we shall afterwards have ample opportunities of exposing the fallacy of such premature geometrical refinements.</p><p>The thermometers were constructed by Creighton with his well-known nicety, and the divisions were read off with a lens, so that <hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">10</hi>th of a degree could be distinguished. After bestowing the utmost pains in repeating the experi ments, during a period of nearly two months, I found that the only way of removing the little discrepancies which crept in between contiguous measures, was to adopt the astronomical plan of multiplying observations, and deducing truth from the mean. It is essential to heat with extreme slowness and circumspection the vessels A, B, C. One repetition of the experiment occupies on an average seven hours.</p><p>“ The apparatus employed in obtaining these results, has</p><p>the peculiar advantage, over all others, that the mercurial column is never heated. It is the concurrent opinion of all chemical philosophers, that caloric travels downwards in liquids with extreme slowness and difficulty. Indeed, Count Rumford’s experiments led him to infer, that heat could not descend in fluids at all.</p><p>“ It is evident that, in my constructions, figures 15, 16, and 17, only that small portion of quicksilver within the</p><p>vessels A, B, and C, will be affected by the heat, but the measuring column is beyond the reach of its influence.”</p><p>The Elastic Force of the Vapour of Water in inches of Mercury, obtained from Experiments by Dr Ure.</p><table><row><cell>Temp.</cell><cell>Force.</cell><cell>Temp.</cell><cell>Force.</cell><cell>Temp.</cell><cell>Force.</cell><cell>Temp.</cell><cell>Force.</cell><cell>Temp.</cell><cell>Force.</cell><cell>Temp.</cell><cell>Force.</cell></row><row><cell>24</cell><cell>0∙170</cell><cell>115°</cell><cell>2∙820</cell><cell>195°</cell><cell>21∙100</cell><cell>242»</cell><cell>53∙600</cell><cell>270»</cell><cell>86∙300</cell><cell>295·6°</cell><cell>130∙400</cell></row><row><cell>32</cell><cell>0∙200</cell><cell>120</cell><cell>3∙300</cell><cell>200</cell><cell>23∙600</cell><cell>245</cell><cell>56∙340</cell><cell>271∙2</cell><cell>88 000</cell><cell>295</cell><cell>129·000</cell></row><row><cell>40</cell><cell>0250</cell><cell>125</cell><cell>3∙830</cell><cell>205</cell><cell>25∙900</cell><cell>245∙8</cell><cell>57∙100</cell><cell>273∙7</cell><cell>91∙200</cell><cell>297∙1</cell><cell>133∙900</cell></row><row><cell>50</cell><cell>0∙360</cell><cell>130</cell><cell>4∙366</cell><cell>210</cell><cell>28∙880</cell><cell>248∙5</cell><cell>60∙400</cell><cell>275</cell><cell>93∙480</cell><cell>298∙8</cell><cell>137∙400</cell></row><row><cell>55</cell><cell>0∙416</cell><cell>135</cell><cell>5∙070</cell><cell>212</cell><cell>30000</cell><cell>250</cell><cell>61∙900</cell><cell>275∙7</cell><cell>94∙600</cell><cell>300</cell><cell>139700</cell></row><row><cell>60</cell><cell>0∙516</cell><cell>140</cell><cell>5∙770</cell><cell>216∙6</cell><cell>33∙400</cell><cell>251∙6</cell><cell>63∙500</cell><cell>277∙9</cell><cell>97∙800</cell><cell>300∙6</cell><cell>140·900</cell></row><row><cell>65</cell><cell>0∙630</cell><cell>145</cell><cell>6∙600</cell><cell>220</cell><cell>35∙540</cell><cell>254∙5</cell><cell>66∙700</cell><cell>279.5</cell><cell>101∙600</cell><cell>302</cell><cell>144∙300</cell></row><row><cell>70</cell><cell>0∙726</cell><cell>150</cell><cell>7∙530</cell><cell>221∙6</cell><cell>36∙700</cell><cell>255</cell><cell>67.250</cell><cell>280</cell><cell>101∙900</cell><cell>303∙8</cell><cell>147∙700</cell></row><row><cell>75</cell><cell>0∙860</cell><cell>155</cell><cell>8∙500</cell><cell>225</cell><cell>39∙110</cell><cell>257∙5</cell><cell>69∙800</cell><cell>281∙8</cell><cell>104∙400</cell><cell>305</cell><cell>150∙560</cell></row><row><cell>80</cell><cell>1∙010</cell><cell>160</cell><cell>9∙600</cell><cell>226∙3</cell><cell>40∙100</cell><cell>260</cell><cell>72∙300</cell><cell>283∙8</cell><cell>107·700</cell><cell>306∙8</cell><cell>154∙400</cell></row><row><cell>85</cell><cell>1∙170</cell><cell>165</cell><cell>10∙800</cell><cell>230</cell><cell>43∙100</cell><cell>260∙4</cell><cell>72∙800</cell><cell>285∙2</cell><cell>112∙200</cell><cell>308</cell><cell>157∙700</cell></row><row><cell>90</cell><cell>1360</cell><cell>170</cell><cell>12∙050</cell><cell>230∙5</cell><cell>43∙500</cell><cell>262∙8</cell><cell>75∙900</cell><cell>287∙2</cell><cell>114∙800</cell><cell>310</cell><cell>161∙300</cell></row><row><cell>95</cell><cell>1∙640</cell><cell>175</cell><cell>13∙550</cell><cell>234∙5</cell><cell>46∙800</cell><cell>264∙9</cell><cell>77∙900</cell><cell>289</cell><cell>118·200</cell><cell>311∙4</cell><cell>164800</cell></row><row><cell>100</cell><cell>1∙860</cell><cell>180</cell><cell>15∙160</cell><cell>235</cell><cell>47∙220</cell><cell>265</cell><cell>78∙040</cell><cell>290</cell><cell>120∙150</cell><cell>312</cell><cell>167·000</cell></row><row><cell>105</cell><cell>2∙100</cell><cell>185</cell><cell>16∙900</cell><cell>238∙5</cell><cell>50∙300</cell><cell>267</cell><cell>81∙900</cell><cell>292∙3</cell><cell>123∙100</cell><cell/><cell/></row><row><cell>110</cell><cell>2∙456</cell><cell>190</cell><cell>19·000</cell><cell>240</cell><cell>51∙700</cell><cell>269</cell><cell>84∙900</cell><cell>294</cell><cell>126∙700</cell><cell>312</cell><cell>1655</cell></row></table><p>31.
