<p><span class="font0">from every point of the circumference of the chink GHNM with the velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v.</span><span class="font0"> If any part of this chink were shut up,&nbsp;there would be a pressure on that part equivalent to the&nbsp;force of efflux from the opposite part. Therefore, when all&nbsp;is open, these efforts of efflux balance each other all round.&nbsp;There is not therefore any tendency in this compound vessel to move to any side. But take away the plane MN, and&nbsp;there would immediately arise a pressure in the direction&nbsp;Ee equal to the weight of the column </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">2sh.</span><span class="font0"> This is therefore balanced by the pressure on the circular plane MN,&nbsp;which is therefore equal to this weight, and the proposition&nbsp;is demonstrated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A number of experiments were made by Professor Krafft at St Petersburg, by receiving the vein on a plane which&nbsp;was fastened to the arm of a balance, having a scale hanging on the opposite arm. The resistance or pressure on&nbsp;the plane was measured by weights put into the scale ; and&nbsp;the velocity of the jet was measured by means of the distance to which it spouted on a horizontal plane.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The results of these experiments were as conformable to the theory as could be wished. The resistance was always&nbsp;a little less than what the formula required, but greatly exceeded its half; the result of the generally received theories. This defect should be expected ; for the demonstration supposes the plane MN to be infinitely extended, so&nbsp;that the film of water which issues through the chink may&nbsp;be accurately parallel to the plane, which never can be&nbsp;completely effected. Also it was supposed that the velocity was justly measured by the amplitude of the parabola&nbsp;described when the plane was removed. But it is well&nbsp;known that the very putting the plane MN in the way of&nbsp;the jet, though at the distance of an inch from the orifice,&nbsp;will diminish the velocity of the efflux through this orifice,&nbsp; Bernoulli hoped to render this proposition more extensive and applicable to oblique impulses, when the axis AC&nbsp;of the vein (fig. 12) is inclined to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">plane in an angle ACN. But here all the simplicity of the case is gone,&nbsp;and we are now obliged to ascertain&nbsp;the motion of each filament. It might&nbsp;not perhaps be impossible to determine what must happen in the plane&nbsp;of the figure, that is, in a plane passing through the axis of the vein, and perpendicular to the&nbsp;plane MN. But even in this case it would be extremely&nbsp;difficult to determine how much of the fluid will go in the&nbsp;direction EKG, and what will go in the path FLH, and to&nbsp;ascertain the form of each filament, and the velocity in its&nbsp;different points. In the real state of the case, the water&nbsp;will dissipate from the centre C on every side ; and we cannot tell in what proportions. Let us, however, consider a&nbsp;little what happens in the plane of the figure, and suppose&nbsp;that all the water goes either in the course EKG or in the&nbsp;course FLIL Let the quantities of water which take&nbsp;these two courses have the proportions of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n,</span><span class="font0"> and let&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m + n</span><span class="font0"> = 1. Let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font0"> = the velocity at A, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">v</span><span class="font0"> = the velocity&nbsp;at G, and u = the velocity at H ; and let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ</span><span class="font0"> = the supplement of the angle ACM. Now, since </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m + n —</span><span class="font0"> 1, and since&nbsp;the quantity of fluid which passes through A in a given time&nbsp;is proportional to the velocity, the momentum or quantity&nbsp;of motion at A in the direction AC is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mid,</span><span class="font0"> and the quantity&nbsp;of motion at G in the same direction is mc<sup>2</sup> cos. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ,</span><span class="font0"> so that&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> (Λ<sup>2</sup> — ι&gt;∙ cos. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ)</span><span class="font0"> is the quantity of motion destroyed by&nbsp;the plane CM, which is obviously equal to the resistance&nbsp;of that plane, or equal to the pressure of the sheet of fluid&nbsp;GKEACM. In the same manner it is shown that the quantity of motion destroyed by the plane CN, or the pressure&nbsp;of the sheet of fluid HLFACN, is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n (h<sup>2</sup> + id</span><span class="font0"> cos. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ)</span><span class="font0"> (remembering that in this case cos. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ</span><span class="font0"> is negative) ; therefore&nbsp;the sum of these two pressures, or the whole pressure on&nbsp;the plane MN, in the direction AC, is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m (h<sup>1</sup> — v<sup>,</sup></span><span class="font0"> cos. ρ)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">+ n</span><span class="font0"> (Λ<sup>i</sup> + m</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;"><sup>2</sup></span><span class="font0"> cos. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ),</span><span class="font0"> which being multiplied by the sine&nbsp;of ACM, or sin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ,</span><span class="font0"> gives the pressure perpendicular to&nbsp;MN equal to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{rn(fl<sup>2</sup>—v<sup>i</sup></span><span class="font0"> cos. p) + </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span class="font0"> (⅛<sup>2</sup> + κ<sup>2</sup>cos.ρ)}sin.p.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But there remains a pressure in the direction perpendicular to the axis of the vein, which is not balanced, as in the former case, by the equality on opposite sides of the&nbsp;axis. The pressure arising from the water which escapes&nbsp;at G has an effect opposite to that produced by the water&nbsp;which escapes at H. When this is taken into account, we&nbsp;shall find that their joint efforts perpendicular to AC are&nbsp;(&gt;n — </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">n)∕d</span><span class="font0"> sin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ,</span><span class="font0"> which, being multiplied by the cosine of&nbsp;ACM, gives the action perpendicular to the plane MN =&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(m — n) h<sup>ι</sup></span><span class="font0"> cos. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ</span><span class="font0"> sin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sum or joint effort of all these pressures is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rn(k<sup>3</sup> — v<sup>i</sup> cos. φ)</span><span class="font0"> sin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ + n (h<sup>i</sup> — u<sup>i</sup></span><span class="font0"> cos. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ)</span><span class="font0"> sin. ρ + .&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(m — n)</span><span class="font0"> Λ<sup>2</sup> cos. p sin. p.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus, from this case, which is much simpler than can happen in nature, seeing that there will always be a lateral&nbsp;efflux, the determination of the impulse is as uncertain and&nbsp;vague as it was sure and precise in the former case.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is therefore without proper authority that the absolute impulse of a vein of fluid on a plane which receives it wholly,&nbsp;is asserted to be proportional to the sine of incidence. If&nbsp;indeed we suppose the velocities in G and H to be equal to&nbsp;that at A, then </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h — v·= u,</span><span class="font0"> and the whole impulse is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h<sup>t</sup></span><span class="font0"> sin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">as is commonly supposed. But this cannot be. Both the&nbsp;velocity and quantity at H are less than those at G. Nay,&nbsp;frequently there is no efflux on the side H when the obliquity is very great. We made conclude, in general, that&nbsp;the oblique impulse will always bear to the direct impulse&nbsp;a greater proportion than that of the sine of incidence to&nbsp;radius. If the whole water escapes at G, and none goes off&nbsp;laterally, the pressure will be (⅛<sup>2</sup> + Λ<sup>2</sup> cos. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ — v<sup>i</sup></span><span class="font0"> cos. p)&nbsp;sin. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">φ.</span><span class="font0"> The experiments of the Abbé Bossut show, in the&nbsp;plainest manner, that the pressure of a vein, striking obliquely on a plane which receives it wholly, diminishes&nbsp;faster than in the ratio of the square of the sine of incidence ;&nbsp;whereas, when the oblique plane is wholly immersed in the&nbsp;stream, the impulse is much greater than in this proportion,&nbsp;and in great obliquities is nearly as the sine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nor will this proposition determine the impulse of a fluid on a plane wholly immersed in it, even when the impulse&nbsp;is perpendicular to the plane. The circumstance is now&nbsp;wanting on which we can establish a calculation, namely,&nbsp;the angle of final deflection. Could this be ascertained for&nbsp;each filament, and the velocity of the filament, the principles are completely adequate to an accurate solution of the&nbsp;problem. In the experiments which we mentioned to have&nbsp;been made under the inspection of Sir Charles Knowles, a&nbsp;cylinder of six inches diameter was exposed to the action&nbsp;of a stream moving precisely one foot per second ; and&nbsp;when certain deductions were made for the water which&nbsp;was held adhering to the posterior base (as will be noticed&nbsp;afterwards), the impulse was found equal to 3½ ounces avoirdupois. There were thirty-six coloured filaments distributed on the stream, in such situations as to give the most useful indications of their curvature. It was found necessary&nbsp;to have some which passed under the body and some above&nbsp;it; for the form of these filaments, at the same distance&nbsp;from the axis of the cylinder, was considerably different ;&nbsp;and those filaments which were situated in planes neither&nbsp;horizontal nor vertical took a double curvature. In short,&nbsp;the curves were all traced with great care, and the deflecting forces were computed for each, and reduced to the</span></p>
