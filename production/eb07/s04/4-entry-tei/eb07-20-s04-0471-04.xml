a city of Turkey in Europe, the ancient Sardi- ca. It is situated in Romelia, and is the capital of a province of its own name. It is on an extensive plain, between the two rivers Iscar and Rissava. It is surrounded</p><p>with walls flanked by towers, and defended by a citadel. It is the seat of a Greek and of a Catholic bishop ; has twenty-three mosques, several Greek, Catholic, and Ar- menian churches, some Jewish synagogues, 8000 houses, with about 48,000 inhabitants. It is one of the most flou- rishing cities of the empire, depending chiefly on its manu- factures. They consist of silk, woollen and linen goods, and various smaller articles. The general appearance of the town is somewhat imposing ; but many of the houses are of wood, and look meanly, as there are few glass win- dows, and generally iron grating in their stead. Sofia was built by the emperor Justinian out of the ruins of the an- cient Sardica, and fell under the power of the Turks in 1382.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
