<p><span class="font0">REFUGEES, a term at firſt applied to the French Proteſtants, who, by the revocation of the edict of&nbsp;Nantz, were conſtrained to fly from perſeeution, and&nbsp;take refuge in foreign countries. Since that time,&nbsp;however, it has been extended to all ſuch as leave their&nbsp;country in times of diſtreſs ; and hence, ſince the revolt&nbsp;of the Britiſii colonies in America, we have frequently&nbsp;heard of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">American refugees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REGALE, a magnificent entertainment or treat, given to ambaiſadors and other perſons of diſtinction,&nbsp;to entertain or do them honour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is uſual in Italy, at the arriv∙al of a traveller of eminence, to ſend him a regale, that is, a prefent of&nbsp;ſweetmeats, fruits, ,&amp;c. by way of refreſhment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REGALIA, in law, the lights and prerogatives of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">king. See Prerogative.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Regalia is aſſo uſed for the apparatus of a coronation ; as the crown, the ſceptre with the crofs, that with the dove, St Edward’s ſtaff, the globe, and the&nbsp;erb with the croſs, four ſeveral ſwords, &amp;c.—The re-galia of Scotland were depofited in the caſtle of Edinburgh in the year 1707, in what is called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jewel&nbsp;GJfi.ee.</span><span class="font0"> This room was lately opened by ſome commſſ-fioners appointed by the king, when the large cheſt in&nbsp;which it is ſhppoſed they were placed was found ; but&nbsp;as it has not, that we have heard of, been opened, it is&nbsp;impoſſible to ſay whether they be there or not. It is&nbsp;very generally thought they were carried to the Tower&nbsp;of London in the reign of Queen Anne ; and a crown&nbsp;is there ſhewn which is called the Scotch crown. AVe&nbsp;do not believe, however, that that is the real crown of&nbsp;Scotland; and think it probable that the Scotch regalia&nbsp;are in the cheſt which was lately found. If they are&nbsp;not there, they muſt have been taken away by ſtealth,&nbsp;and either deſtroyed or melted down, for we do not believe that they are in the Tower of London.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">REGARDER, an ancient officer of the king’s fo-reſt, fworn to make the regard of the foreſt every year ; that is, to take a view of its limits, to inquire&nbsp;into all offences and defaults committed by the foreſters&nbsp;within the foreft, and to obſerve whether all the officers executed their reſpective duties. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Foresî-Laιυs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REGATA, or Regatta, a ſpecies of amuſement peculiar to the republic of venice. This fpectacle has&nbsp;the power of exciting the greateſt emotions of the heart,&nbsp;admiration, enthufiaſm, a ſenſe of glory, and the whole&nbsp;train of our beſt feelings. The grand regata is only&nbsp;exhibited on particular occaſions, as the vifits of foreign&nbsp;princes and kings at venice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is difficult to givc a juſt idea of the ardour that the notice of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regata</span><span class="font0"> ſpreads among all claffes of the inhabitants of venice. Proud of the exclufive privilege of&nbsp;giving inch a fpectacle, through the wonderful local cir-cumſtances of their city, they are highly delighted with&nbsp;making preparations a long tinie before, in order to contribute all they can towards the perfection and enjoyment&nbsp;of the fpectacle. A thouſand intereſts are formed and&nbsp;augmented every day ; parties in favour of the different&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">competitors who </span><span class="font0">are </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">known </span><span class="font0">j </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the protection of </span><span class="font0">young</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">noblemen given to the gondoliers in their ſervice ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font0">deiire ot honours and rewards in the aſpirants ; aud, in&nbsp;thc midft of all this, that ingenious national induſtry,&nbsp;which awakes the Venetians from their habitual indolence, to derive advantage from the bufineſs and agita-tioπ of the moment : all theſe circumſtances united give&nbsp;to the numerous inhabitants of this lively city a degree&nbsp;of ſpirit and animation which render it during that time&nbsp;a delightful abode in the eyes of the philoſopher and&nbsp;the ſtranger. Crowds of people flock from the adjacent&nbsp;parts, and travellers joyfully repair to thi3 ſcene of&nbsp;gaiety and pleaſure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although it is allowable for any man to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">go </span><span class="font0">and in-ſcribe his name in the liſt of combatants until the fixed number is complete, it will not be amiſs to remark one&nbsp;thing, which has relation to more ancient times. The&nbsp;ſtate of a gondolier * is of much confideration among&nbsp;the people ; whieh is very natural, that having been the&nbsp;primitive condition of the inhabitants of this country.&nbsp;But, befides this general confideration, there are among&nbsp;them ſome families truly diſtinguiſhed and reſpected by&nbsp;their equals, whoſe antiquity is acknowledged, and who,&nbsp;on account of a. ſucceſiion of virtuous men, able in&nbsp;their profeſſion, and honoured for the prizes they have&nbsp;carried oft in theſe conteſts, form the body of noble&nbsp;gondoliers ; often more worthy of that title than the&nbsp;higher order of nobility, who only derive their honours&nbsp;from the merit of their anceſtors, or from their own&nbsp;riches. The confideration for thoſe families is carried&nbsp;ſo far, that, in the diſputes frequently arifing among·&nbsp;the gondoliers in their ordinary paffage of the canals, we&nbsp;ſometimes ſee a quarrel inffantly made up, by the fimple&nbsp;interpofition of a third perſon, who has chanced to be of&nbsp;this reverend body. They are rigid with reſpect to mif∙&nbsp;alliances in their families, and they endeavour reciprocally to give and take their wives among thoſe of their&nbsp;own rank. But we muſt remark here, with pleaſure,&nbsp;that thefe diſtinctions infer no inequality of condition,&nbsp;nor admit any oppreſſion of inferiors, being founded&nbsp;ſolely on laudable and virtuous opinions. Diſtinctions&nbsp;derived ſrom fortune only, are thoſe which always out-rage nature, and often virtue.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In general, the competitors at the great regatas </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">are </span><span class="font0">choſen from among thele families ol reputation. As&nbsp;ſoon as they are fixed upon for this exploit, they ſpend&nbsp;the intermediate time in preparing themſelves for it, by&nbsp;a daily aſſiduous and fatiguing exerciſe» If they are in&nbsp;ſervice, their maſters during that time not only give&nbsp;them their liberty, but aſſo augment their wages. This&nbsp;cuſtom would ſeem to indicate, that they look upon them&nbsp;as perſons coniecrated to the honour of the nation, and&nbsp;under a fort of obligation to contribute to its glory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At laſt the great day arrives. Their relations affem-ble together : they encourage the heroes, by calling to their minds the records of their families ; the women&nbsp;preſent the oar, beſeeching them, in an epic tone, to&nbsp;remember that they are the ſons of famous men, whoſe&nbsp;ſteps they will be expected to follow : this they do with&nbsp;as much ſolemnity as the Spartan women preſented the&nbsp;ſhield to their ſons, bidding them either return with or&nbsp;upon it. Religion, as practiſed among the lower claſs&nbsp;of people,<sub>j</sub> has its flιare in the preparations for this en»&nbsp;terprize. They cauſe maffes to be ſaid ; they make&nbsp;vows to ſome particular church ; and they arm their&nbsp;boats for the contell with, the images of thoſe faint»&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">who are moſt in vogue.
