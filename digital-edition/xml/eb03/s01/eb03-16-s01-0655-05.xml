the juice found in vegetables.</p><p>We obſerved, when treating of <hi rend="smallcaps">Plants,</hi> that it has been long diſputed whether the ſap of plants be analogous to the blood of animals, and circulates in the fame manner. We alſo mentioned the concluſions that Dr Halesdrew from his numerous experiments, which were all in oppoſition to the doctrine that the lap circulates. As the ſubject is curious and intereſting, and as additional light has been thrown upon it of late years, we wiſh to communicate it to our readers as fully as our limits will permit.</p><p>As the vegetable economy is ſtill but imperfectly underſtood, and experiments made for tracing the motion of the ſap may lead to important diſcoveries, we are happy to find, that of late years this ſubject has been again revived. Dr Walker, profeſſor of Natural Hiſtory in the univerſity of Edinburgh, has publiſhed in the 1ſt volume of the Philoſophical Tranſactions of Edinburgh an account of a courſe of very accurate and ingenious experiments, accompanied with obſervations and concluſions made with a caution which inſpires confidence, and is indeed worthy of a diſciple of Bacon. He is the firſt perſon, as far as we know, who thought of comparing the thermometer with the motion of the ſap,</p><p>It is well known that in the ſpring vegetables contain a great quantity of ſap; and there are ſome trees, as the birch and plane, which, if wounded, will diſcharge a great portion of it. Whence is this moiſture derived? Whether is it imbibed from the atmoſphere, or does it flow from the ſoil through the roots? Theſe are the queſtions which require firſt to be anſwered; and Dr Walker’s experiments enable us to anſwer them with confidence.</p><p>He ſelected a vigorous young birch, 30 feet high and 26 inches in circumference at the ground. He bored a hole juſt above the ground on the 1ſt of February, and cut one of its branches at the extremity. He repeated this every ſecond day; but no moiſture appeared at either of the places till the 5th of May, when a ſmall quantity flowed on making an inciſion near the ground. He then cut 21 inciſions in the trunk of the tree, on the north side, at the diſtance of a foot from one another, and reaching from the ground to the height of 20 feet. The inciſions were ſolid triangles, each side being an inch long and an inch deep, and penetrating through the bark and wood. Dr Walker viſited the tree almoſt every day for two months, and marked exactly from which of the inciſions the ſap flowed. He obſerved that it flowed from the loweſt inciſion firſt, and gradually aſcended to the higheſt. The following table will ſhow the progreſs of the ſap upwards, and its correſpondence with the thermometer.</p><p>The firſt column is the day of the month on which the obſervation was made; the ſecond expreſſes the number of inciſions from which the ſap flowed on the day of the month oppoſite; and the third column the degree of the thermometer at noon. Some days are omitted in March, as the inciſions, though made on the 5th, did not bleed till the 11th. Some days are alſo paſſed over in April, becauſe no obſervation was made on account of rain.</p><table> <row> <cell> March. </cell> <cell> N of In. </cell> <cell> Γher.

He found alſo, that when the thermometer at noon is about 49, or between 46 and 50, the ſap riſes about one foot in 24 hours; that when the thermometer is about 45 at noon, it aſcends about<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0662.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0656"/>
one foot in two days; and that it does not aſcend at all unleſs the mid-day beat be above 40. He obſerved that it moves with more velocity through young than through old branches. In one young branch it moved through ſeven feet in one day, the thermometer being at 49, while it moved in the trunk of the tree only ſeven feet in ſeven days. Dr Walker has thus explained the reaſon why the buds on the extremities of branches unfold firſt; becauſe they are placed on the youngeſt wood, to which the ſap flows moſt abundantly.</p><p>The effects produced by the motion of the ſap deferve to be attended to. In thoſe parts to which it has mounted, the bark eaſily ſeparates from the wood, and the ligneous circles may, without difficulty, be detached from one another. The buds begin to ſwell and their ſcales to ſeparate, while thoſe branches to which the ſap has not aſcended remain cloſely folded. When the ſap has reached the extremities of the branches, and has thus pervaded the whole plant, it is ſoon covered with opening buds and ceaſes to bleed. The bleeding ceaſes firſt in the upper parts of the tree, and in the lower parts ſucceſſively downwards, and the wood becomes dry. An inverted branch flows more copiouſly when cut than thoſe which are erect. This is a proof that the aſcent of the ſap is not occaſioned by capillary attraction, for water which has riſen in a ſmall glaſs tube by this attraction will not deſcend when the tube is inverted.</p><p>It is evident that there is an intimate connection between heat and the aſcent of the ſap. It did not begin to flow till the thermometer ſtood at a certain point: when it fell below 40, it was arreſted in its progreſs. The ſouth fide of the tree, when the ſun was bright, bled more profuſely than the north fide; and at ſun-ſet the inciſions at the top ceaſed to bleed, where it was expoſed moſt to the cold air, while it ſtill continued to flow from the incifions next to the ground; the ground retaining its heat longer than the air.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sap,</hi> in ſieges, is a trench, or an approach made under cover of 10 or 1 2 feet broad, when the beſiegers come near the place, and the fire from the garriſon grows ſo dangerous that they are not able to approach uncovered. —There are ſeveral forts of ſaps; the ſingle, which has only a ſingle parapet; the double, having one on each ſide; and the flying, made with gabions, &amp;c. In all ſaps traverſes are left to cover the men.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
