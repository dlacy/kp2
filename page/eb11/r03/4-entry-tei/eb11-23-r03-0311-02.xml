    Stuart, a physician in the household of Queen Henrietta Mariawhen in exile after
    1649, was born in 1648 and was brought up in France. Notwithstanding the desire
    of Louis XIV. to keep her at his court, she was sent to England by Henrietta
    Maria in 1683, when she was appointed maid of honour to Catherine of Braganza,
    Queen of Charles II. Pepys describes her at this time as the greatest beauty he
    had ever seen, and Henrietta Maria called her the prettiest girl in the world.
    Charles IL, who is said to have first seen “ La belle Stewart ” in the
    apartments of his mistress Lady Castlemaine (afterwards duchess of Cleveland),
    quickly became enamoured of her; but for some</p><pb xml:id="eb11-23-r03-0312" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0335.jp2"/><p>time Miss Stewart resisted the king’s importunities, though her behaviour was
    far from modest and “ she had no aversion to scandal.” She had numerous suitors,
    including the duke of Buckingham and Francis Digby, son of the earl of Bristol,
    whose unrequited love for her was celebrated by Dryden. Her beauty appeared to
    her contemporaries to be only equalled by her childish silliness; but her
    letters to her husband, preserved in the British Museum, are not devoid of good
    sense and feeling. The king’s infatuation was so great that when the queen’s
    life was despaired of in 1663, it was reported that he intended to marry Miss
    Stewart, and four years later he was considering the possibility of obtaining a
    divorce to enable him to make her his wife. This was at a time when Charles
    feared he was in danger of losing her as his mistress, her hand being sought in
    marriage by Charles Stuart, duke of Richmond and Lennox. The duchess of
    Cleveland, who was losing her hold on the king’s affections, is reported hy
    Hamilton to have led the king to Miss Stewart’s apartment at midnight when
    Richmond was closeted with her, and the duke was immediately expelled from
    court. In March 1667 the lady eloped from Whitehall with Richmond and married
    him secretly in the country. The king, who was greatly enraged, suspected
    Clarendon of being privy to the marriage, and, according to Burnet, deprived him
    of office for this offence. The duchess of Richmond, however, soon returned to
    court, where she remained for many years; and although she was disfigured by
    small-pox in 1668, she retained her hold on the king’s affections. Her husband
    was sent as ambassador to Denmark, where he died in 1672. The duchess was
    present at the birth of the prince of Wales, son of James II., in 1688, being
    one of those who signed the certificate before the council She died in 1702,
    leaving a valuable property to her nephew the earl of Blantyre, whose seat was
    named Lennoxlove after her.</p><p>    <hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography.—Gilbert Burnet,</hi>
