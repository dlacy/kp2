<p><span class="font2">RÈTREÀT, </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">a military </span><span class="font2">ſenſe. </span><span class="font1">An </span><span class="font0">army or body </span><span class="font2">of men are ſaid to retreat when they turn their backs&nbsp;upon the enemy, or are retiring from the ground they&nbsp;occupied : hence every march in withdrawing from the&nbsp;enemy is called a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retreat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">That which is done in fight of an aélive enemy, who purſues with a ſuperior force, is the moil important part&nbsp;of the ſubject; and is, with reaſon, looked upon as the&nbsp;Ulory of theproſeſſion. It is a manœuvre the moſt delicate,&nbsp;and the propereſt to diſplay the prudence, genius, courage, and addrefs, of an officer who commands: the hiſto-rians of all ages teſtify it ; and hiſtorians have never&nbsp;been ſo laviſh of eulogiums as on the ſubject of the&nbsp;brilliant retreats of our heroes. If it is important, it is&nbsp;no leſs difficult to regulate, on account of the variety&nbsp;of circumſtances, each of which demands different prin-ciples, and an almoſt endlefs detail. Hence a good retreat is eſteemed, by experienced officers, the maſter-pieee of a general. He ſhould therefore be well ac-quainted with the fituation of the country<sub>-</sub> through&nbsp;which he intends to make it, and careful that nothing&nbsp;is omitted to make it ſafe and honourable. See WAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Retreat, is alſo a beat of the drum, at the firing of the evening gun ; at which the drum-major, with all&nbsp;the drums of the battalion, except ſuch as are upon du-ty, beats from the camp-colours on the right to thoſe&nbsp;on the leſt, on the parade of encampment : the drums&nbsp;of all the guards beat alſo ; the trumpets at the ſame&nbsp;time founding at the head of their refpective troops.&nbsp;This is to warn the ſoldiers to forbear firing, and the&nbsp;centinels to challenge, till the break of day that the&nbsp;reveille is beat. The retreat islikewiſe called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ſetting the&nbsp;watch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETRENCHMENT literally fignifies ſomething -cut off or taken from a thing ; in which fenſe it is the&nbsp;ſame with ſubtraction, diminution, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Retrenchment, in the art of war, any kind oſ work raiſed to cover a poll, and fortify it againſt the&nbsp;.enemy, ſuch as ſaſcines loaded with earth, gambions,&nbsp;barrels of earth, ſand-bags, and generally all things&nbsp;that can cover the men and ſtop the enemy. See For-tification and WAR.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RETRIBUTION, a handſome preſent, gratuity, or acknowledgment, given inſtead of a formal ſalary or&nbsp;hire, to perſons employed </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font2">affairs that do not ſo im-mediately fall under eſtimation, nor within the ordinary&nbsp;commerce in money.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RETURN </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(returna</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">retorna),</span><span class="font2"> in law, is uſed in divers ſenſes. ι. Return of writs by ſheriffs and bailiffs&nbsp;is a certificate made by them to the court, of what they&nbsp;have done in relation to the execution of the writ directed to them. This is wrote on the back of the&nbsp;writ by the officer, who thus fends the writ back to the&nbsp;court from whence it iffued, in order that it may be&nbsp;filed. 2. Return oſ a commiſſion, is a certificate or&nbsp;anſwer ſent to the court from whence the commiſſion&nbsp;iffues, concerning what has been done by the commiſ-ſioners. 3. Returns, or days in bank, are certain days&nbsp;in each term, appointed for the return of writs, &amp;c.&nbsp;Thus Hillary term has four returns, viz. in the king’s-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>

In&nbsp;the common pleas, in eight days of St Hillary : from&nbsp;the day of St Hillary, in fifteen days : on the day after the purification : in eight days of the purification.&nbsp;Eaſter term has five returns, viz. in the king’s-bench,&nbsp;on the day next after the fifteenth day from Eaſter :&nbsp;on the day next after the three weeks from Eafter : </span><span class="font1">on&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">the day next after one month from Eaſter : on the day&nbsp;next after five weeks from Eaſter: and on the day next&nbsp;alter the day following aſcenſton-day. In the common&nbsp;pleas, in fifteen days from the feaſt of Eaſter : in three&nbsp;weeks from the feaſt of Eaſter : in one month ſrom&nbsp;Eaſter day : in five weeks from Eaſter day : on the&nbsp;day after the aſcenſton-day. Trinity term has four re-turns, viz. on the day following the ſecond day after&nbsp;Trinity : on the day following the eighth’day after Trinity : on the day next after the fifteenth day from Tri-nity : on the day next after three weeks from Trinity.&nbsp;In the common pleas, on the day after Trinity : in&nbsp;eight days of Trinity: in fifteen days from Trinity : in&nbsp;three weeks from Trinity. Michaelmas term has fix&nbsp;returns, viz. on the day next after three weeks from&nbsp;St Michael : on the day next after one month of St&nbsp;Michael: on the day following'the ſecond day after&nbsp;All-fouls : on the day next after the ſecond day after&nbsp;St Martin : on the day following the octave of St&nbsp;Martin : on the day next after fifteen days of St Martin. In the common pleas, in three weeks from St&nbsp;Michael : in one month from St Michael : on the day&nbsp;after AU-ſouls : on the day after St Martin : on the&nbsp;octave of St Martin : in fifteen days from St Martin.&nbsp;It is to be obferved, that, as in the king’s-bench, all&nbsp;returns are to be made on ſome particular day of the&nbsp;week in each term, care muſt be taken not to make&nbsp;the writs out of that court returnable on a non-judicial&nbsp;day ; ſuch as Sunday, and All-faints, in Michaelmas&nbsp;term, the purification in Hillary, the afeenfion in Eaſter, and Midſummer-day, except it ſhould fall on thc&nbsp;firſt day of Trinity term.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RETUSARI, an ifland in Ruſſia, is a long ſiip of land, or rather ſand, through the middle of which runs&nbsp;a ridge of granite. It is 20 miles from Peterſhurg by&nbsp;water, four from the ſhore of Ingria, and nine from the&nbsp;coaft of Carelia. It is about 10 miles in circumference, and was overſpread with firs and pines rvhen Pe-ter firſt conquered it ſrom the Swedes. It contains at&nbsp;preſent about 3c,000 inhabitants, including the ſailors&nbsp;and garrifon, the former of whom amount to about&nbsp;12,000, the latter to 1500 men. The iſiand affords a&nbsp;ſmall quantity of paſture, produces vegetables, and a few&nbsp;fruits, ſuch as apples, currants, gooſeberries, and ſtraw-.&nbsp;berries, which thrive in this northern climate.</span></p>
