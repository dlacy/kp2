<p><span class="font1">Irish king of treason before King Arthur, is probably part of the original tale. He goes with the absolved monarch to Ireland at&nbsp;his request, and is prayed to accompany Yseult to Cornwall,&nbsp;whither her father sends her as King Mark’s bride. Yseult’s mother&nbsp;delivers a philtre or love-potion to Brangian (or Bronwen), her&nbsp;daughter's nurse, which the latter is commissioned to give Yseult&nbsp;to drink on the wedding-day, in order that she may conceive a true&nbsp;wifely affection for her stranger husband. Brangian, however,&nbsp;gives' it to Tristan and Yseult, who drink, unconscious of the spell&nbsp;that is about to influence their lives. They love each other at&nbsp;once and for ever. During the voyage they land on an island,&nbsp;where Tristan, by overcoming an enchantment, proves that he and&nbsp;his companion are the best knight and fairest lady in all the world.&nbsp;They reach Cornwall at last, and think with dread on the approach&nbsp;of the fatal night which is to separate them and to make King&nbsp;Mark aware of his bride’s fault. A device, which appeared to the&nbsp;old romancers one of easy performance, is suggested by Brangian,&nbsp;who, to save her mistress’s honour, takes her place on the marriage&nbsp;night, trusting that King Mark’s carousals and the darkness will&nbsp;cover the fraud. The scheme is carried out satisfactorily ; but the&nbsp;fair Yseult hires two ruffians to slay Brangian, lest the fact should&nbsp;ever come to light. The intending murderers, however, are&nbsp;smitten with pity, and simply leave their victim bound to a&nbsp;tree, from which position she is soon afterwards rescued. As her&nbsp;rescuer was Palamedes, the Saracen knight, who must be looked&nbsp;upon as one of the inventions of Hélie de Borron, we may venture&nbsp;to hope that Yseult’s unwomanly cruelty formed no part of the&nbsp;original story. Palamedes is a magnanimous and interesting character, who loves Yseult with a purer love than Tristan, and who&nbsp;spends his life in a generous antagonism to his rival. The man&nbsp;who invented Palamedes and Guiron must have been himself a&nbsp;knight of the noblest type. The intrigue of the two lovers is&nbsp;carried on for some time, till Mark’s suspicions are aroused and&nbsp;Tristan leaves Cornwall. Again he receives by treachery a poisoned&nbsp;wound ; but, as he cannot return to Mark’s court to obtain healing&nbsp;at the hands of the fair Yseult, he decides upon going to Brittany,&nbsp;to seek a remedy there from her cousin, the white-handed Yseult,&nbsp;who is equally expert in treating wounds. She cures him and falls&nbsp;in love with him ; he marries her from gratitude. The description of the wedding night proves that he still loves the other&nbsp;Yseult, for he remains faithful to her in the most material point,&nbsp;the white-handed lady being so innocent that she is unaware of&nbsp;the slight cast upon her charms. He makes his wife’s brother&nbsp;Peredur or Pheredur his confidant, and the two quit Brittany together and reach Cornwall. A fresh source of misery opens for him&nbsp;now, as Pheredur falls in love with fair Yseult. Tristan becomes&nbsp;insane and wanders away ; but after some time he is brought back&nbsp;to the court, where Yseult restores him to reason, at the cost, however, of reawakening the jealous wrath of King Mark, who compels&nbsp;him to quit Cornwall, making him swear never to return. Hélie’s&nbsp;Tristan now joins the Round Table company at King Arthur’s court,&nbsp;and King Mark, still unsatisfied, goes thither also with the purpose&nbsp;of bringing about his nephew’s death. The unfavourable view of&nbsp;Mark’s character is here heightened by making him speak and act&nbsp;in the most ridiculous manner. Arthur reconciles the uncle and&nbsp;the nephew ; Tristan goes back with Mark, and frees Cornwall from&nbsp;an invasion by the Saxons ; but he fails to win favour from the&nbsp;king, who puts him in a dungeon. He is released by an insurrection and King Mark himself is imprisoned ; Tristan flies with Yseult&nbsp;and is received in Joyeuse Garde by Lancelot, until King Arthur&nbsp;brings about a fresh reconciliation, and Yseult is restored to Mark&nbsp;along with his kingdom. Tristan now returns to his neglected wife,&nbsp;but finds that a revolt has fortunately saved him from the necessity&nbsp;of repaying her devotion with caresses. He goes forth to fight, and&nbsp;subdues the rebel count, but is sorely wounded again. The white-handed lady tends him, cures him, and becomes his wife in deed&nbsp;as well as in name. He quits her once more, and renews his secret&nbsp;intercourse with fair Yseult in Cornwall, until discovery compels&nbsp;him to return to Brittany. In giving his aid to the unsuccessful&nbsp;prosecution of an amour by his brother-in-law he is once more&nbsp;poisonously wounded. He comes to such a dangerous pass that at&nbsp;last he sends a secret messenger to fair Yseult, to bring her back&nbsp;with him if possible. Should she be able and willing to come&nbsp;the ship is to be rigged with white sails ; with black, on the contrary, if the mission is unsuccessful. Tristan’s anxiety comes to&nbsp;the knowledge of white-handed Yseult, who, seized with sudden&nbsp;jealousy, when the white-sailed vessel comes gaily dancing over the&nbsp;waves, goes to her sick husband and tells him that the sails are&nbsp;black. He bids her at once farewell and dies of a broken heart. Fair&nbsp;Yseult, on reaching land, hears of his death, makes her way to the&nbsp;chamber where his corpse is lying, and dies upon her dead hero’s&nbsp;breast. Their bodies are conveyed to Cornwall, along with Tristan’s&nbsp;sword, formerly Morhoult’s, and Mark learns the story of the love-potion. Seized with pity, he has the two lovers buried not far from&nbsp;each other, and a wondrous tree extends its branches to overshadow&nbsp;their two graves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Palamedes : Meliadus and Guiron.— This, the last romance</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">written by any of the original writers of the Round Table stories, was composed by Hélie de Borron about 1220 at the desire of&nbsp;Henry III. of England (who paid him noble guerdon for his labour).&nbsp;He had already made Palamedes (the Saracen knight finally baptized&nbsp;and adopted to the Round Table) so prominent and so noble a character in his Bret, or romance of Tristan, that the king wished for&nbsp;another book on the subject. Since the story was to be one of&nbsp;knightly courtesy, its name should be Palamedes. As that hero&nbsp;takes only a minor part in the transactions of the story it is difficult to believe that he meant the name as other than a metaphor.&nbsp;The book is divided into two distinct tales,—one relating the adventures of Meliadus, who begat Tristan upon the adulterous queen of&nbsp;Scotland, and the other those of a knight whose name appears here&nbsp;for the first time,—Guiron le Courtois.@@<sup>1</sup> Meliadus is a dull and&nbsp;clumsy composition, chiefly remarkable for the circumstance that it&nbsp;alludes to the Charlemagne romances, and includes among its personages Aryhoan of Saxony, ancestor of Ogyers le Danois (Ogier&nbsp;the Dane). Even the account which it gives of Tristan’s birth is&nbsp;wholly at variance with that which the writer had already given&nbsp;(or accepted) in the romance of Tristan and Yseult. As for Guiron,&nbsp;the beauty of his character redeems the tediousness of the narrative.&nbsp;From the point of view of human noble-mindedness it is the best of&nbsp;all the Arthurian tales, Guiron being equally free from the criminal&nbsp;sensuality of Lancelot and Tristan on the one hand, and distant&nbsp;from the superangelical purity of Galaad and Perceval on the other.&nbsp;Under the most trying circumstances he keeps himself chastely&nbsp;aloof from sin, although love is mutual between himself and his&nbsp;friend’s wife ; and, when on one occasion he reflects how near he&nbsp;has been to the verge of criminality, he strikes his own sword into&nbsp;his breast as a punishment. It is needless to say that he does not&nbsp;die but lives to see that same friend, Denain le Roux, carry off a&nbsp;maiden on whom he (Guiron) has bestowed a more justifiable affection. When, after a year’s vain search, he meets his false friend&nbsp;and his ravished lady-love together, he fights and conquers Denain&nbsp;but spares his life, and goes away with the lady, still in love with&nbsp;her. Denain exhibits his friendship and gratitude effectually afterwards, but the story is left unfinished, Guiron and Bloye having&nbsp;been entrapped by treachery and lying still within the walls of a&nbsp;dungeon. The author refers to his Meliadus for an account of their&nbsp;liberation ; but this simply shows that he intended to rewrite&nbsp;Meliadus. Fifty or sixty years later Rusticien of Pisa abridged the&nbsp;Palamedes, and inserted the incidents of the two in his compilation of Arthurian romances, now lost as a whole, although usually&nbsp;confounded with the Morte Arthur. From his compilation the&nbsp;printed Meliadus and Guiron were further abridged and finally&nbsp;printed so in separate form.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ysaie le Triste, Arthus de Bretaigηe, and Ρerceforest are three romances which had also considerable vogue, but, although they&nbsp;belong to the Arthurian cycle, they have no real connexion beyond&nbsp;the use of British names and the supposed kinship of the heroes&nbsp;with those of the old stories. Almost as much might be alleged&nbsp;against the Meliadus and the Gτιiron, but they were at least written&nbsp;by one of the first authors of the genuine works, and he had presumably some acquaintance with the British folk-legends. The fact&nbsp;that Rusticien of Pisa about 1270-75 abridged and compiled in a&nbsp;single great book the scattered and discordant stories of the earlier&nbsp;period, at the request of Prince Edward (afterwards Edward I.) of&nbsp;England, is universally conceded. That compilation has never been&nbsp;printed ; it is even uncertain whether any MS. in existence represents it, for, although the English Morte Arthur is usually supposed&nbsp;to have been compendiously translated from it, we may infer with&nbsp;greater probability that Sir Thomas Malory used an earlier compilation, perhaps the work of Hélie de Borron. One reason to justify&nbsp;such a conjecture may be found in the absence of Guiron and&nbsp;Meliadus from the English book, which would hardly be the case&nbsp;if the former notion were correct, since we know that Rusticien&nbsp;published an abridged text of those two works. Rusticien’s&nbsp;compilation could in fact only be recovered approximately by reuniting the texts of the various Arthurian romances as printed in&nbsp;French in the 15th and 16th centuries,—these abridged and inferior&nbsp;texts having apparently been derived or rewritten from his book,&nbsp;not from MSS. of the separate old romances. The Morte Arthur&nbsp;was printed by Caxton from Sir Thomas Malory’s MS. translation&nbsp;or adaptation made in England not many years before the printer’s&nbsp;establishment at Westminster. As an early English text and as&nbsp;the only existing homogeneous embodiment of the ancient Franco-British romances, it is of the highest interest, while at the same&nbsp;time it breathes the earnest and simple feeling which animates&nbsp;the originals, — differing thus loto cœlo from the colder, more artificial, and less interesting narratives which were invented in tho&nbsp;15th century, and of which the Ysaie, Arthus de Bretaigne, and&nbsp;Pereef orest are examples. All three may be referred to the first half&nbsp;of that century, although it has been alleged that the second was&nbsp;written in the 14th. Ysaie forestalls to some extent the type of&nbsp;the 16th and 17th century French romances. It is an early instance</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@</span><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> Guiron appears to be the Breton or Cymric word which means “loyal,’ “ true,” or “ honest,&quot; and is a Otting title for the hero.</span></p>
