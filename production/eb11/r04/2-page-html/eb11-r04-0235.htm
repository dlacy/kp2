<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History.—</span><span class="font1">It may be doubted whether the Romans ever effected even a temporary settlement in the area of the modern&nbsp;county. At that period, and for long afterwards, the land&nbsp;was occupied by Gaelic Piets, who, in the 6th and 7th centuries,&nbsp;were converted to Christianity by followers of St Columba.&nbsp;Throughout the next three centuries the natives were continually harassed by Norse pirates, of whose presence tokens have&nbsp;survived in several place-names (Dingwall, Tain, &amp;c.). At&nbsp;this time the country formed part of the great province of&nbsp;Moray, which then extended as far north as Dornoch Firth&nbsp;and the Oykell, and practically comprised the whole of Ross&nbsp;and Cromarty, excepting a comparatively narrow strip on&nbsp;the Atlantic seaboard. When the rule of the Celtic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">maormors&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or earls ceased in the 12th century, consequent on the plantation of the district with settlers from other parts (including&nbsp;a body of Flemings), by order of David I., who was anxious&nbsp;to break the power of the Celts, the bounds of Moravia w’ere&nbsp;contracted and the earldom of Ross arose. At first Ross&nbsp;proper only included the territory adjoining Moray and Dornoch Firths. The first earl was Malcolm MacHeth, who received the title from Malcolm IV. After his rebellion in 1179&nbsp;chronic insurrection ensued, which was quelled by Alexander II.,&nbsp;who bestowed the earldom on Farquhar Macintaggart (Farquhar,&nbsp;son of the priest), then abbot of Applccross, and in that capacity&nbsp;lord of the western district. William, 4th earl, was present&nbsp;with his clan at the battle of Bannockburn (1314), and almost&nbsp;a century later (1412) the castle of Dingwall, the chief seat&nbsp;on the mainland of Donald, lord of the Isles, was captured&nbsp;after the disastrous fight at Harlaw in Aberdeenshire, which&nbsp;Donald had provoked when his claim to the earldom was rejected. The earldom reverted to the crown in 1424, but James&nbsp;I. soon afterwards restored it to the heiress of the line, the&nbsp;mother of Alexander MacDonald, 3rd lord of the Isles, who&nbsp;thus became nth earl. In consequence, however, of the&nbsp;treason of John Macdonald, 4th and last lord of the Isles and&nbsp;12th earl of Ross, the earldom was again vested in the crown&nbsp;(1476). Five years later James III. bestowed it on his second&nbsp;son, James Stewart, whom he also created duke of Ross in&nbsp;1488. By the 16th century the whole area of the county&nbsp;was occupied by different clans. The Rosses held what is&nbsp;now Easter Ross; the Munroes the small tract around Ben&nbsp;Wyvis, including Dingwall; the Macleods Lewis, and, in the&nbsp;mainland, the district between Loch Maree and Loch Torridon;&nbsp;the MacDonalds of Glengarry, Coygach, and the district between Strome Ferry and Kyle of Lochalsh, and the Mackenzies&nbsp;the remainder. The county of Ross was constituted in 166 r,&nbsp;and Cromarty in 1685 and 1698, both being consolidated into&nbsp;the present county in 1889 (see Cromarty, county). Apart&nbsp;from occasional conflicts between rival clans, the only battles&nbsp;in the shire were those of Invercarron, at the head of Dornoch&nbsp;Firth, when Montrose was crushed by Colonel ‘Strachan on the&nbsp;27th of April 1650, and Glenshiel, when the Jacobites, under&nbsp;the earl of Seaforth, aided by Spaniards, were defeated, at the&nbsp;pass of Strachel, near Bridge of Shiel, by General Wightman&nbsp;on the nth of June 1719.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquities.</span><span class="font0">—The </span><span class="font1">principal relics of antiquity—mainly stone circles, cairns and forts—are found in the eastern district. A&nbsp;vitrified fort crowns the hill of Knockfarrel in the; parish of Fodderty,&nbsp;and there is a circular dun near the village of Lochcarron. Some&nbsp;fine examples of sculptured stones occur, especially those which,&nbsp;according to tradition, mark the burial-place of the three sons of a&nbsp;Danish king who were shipwrecked off the coast of Nigg. The&nbsp;largest and handsomest of these three crosses—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">clach-a-charridh,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or Stone of Lamentation—stands at Shandwick. It is about 9 ft.&nbsp;high and contains representations of the martyrdom of St Andrew&nbsp;and figures of an elephant and dog. It fell during a storm in 1847&nbsp;and was broken in three pieces. On the top of the cross in Nigg&nbsp;churchyard are two figures with outstretched arms in the act of&nbsp;supplication ; the dove descends between them, and below are two&nbsp;dogs. The cross was knocked down by the fall of the belfry in 1725,&nbsp;but has been riveted together. The third stone formerly stood at&nbsp;Cadboll of Hilltown, but was removed for security to the grounds of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Invergordon Castle. Among old castles are those of Lochslin, in the parish of Fearn, said to date from the 13th century, which,&nbsp;though ruinous, possesses two square towers in good preservation;&nbsp;Balone, in the parish of Tarbat, once a stronghold of the earls of&nbsp;Ross; the remains of Dingwell Castle, their original seat; and&nbsp;Eilean Donain in Loch Alsh, which was blown up by English warships&nbsp;during the abortive Jacobite rising in 1719.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROSSANO, a city of Calabria, Italy, in the province of Cos-enza, 24 m. N.N.É. from that town direct, with a station 4 m. distant on the line from Metaponto to Reggio. Pop. (1901)&nbsp;13,354. It is picturesquely situated on a precipitous spur of&nbsp;the mountain mass of Sila overlooking the Gulf of Taranto,&nbsp;the highest part of the town being 975 ft. above sea-level.&nbsp;Rossano is the seat of an archbishop, and in the cathedral is&nbsp;preserved the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Codex Rossancnsis,</span><span class="font1"> an uncial MS. of the Gospels&nbsp;of Matthew and Mark in silver characters on purple vellum,&nbsp;with twelve miniatures, of great interest in the history of&nbsp;Byzantine art, belonging to the 6th century a.d. It was&nbsp;brought to Grottaferrata </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> for the exhibition of Byzantine&nbsp;art held there in 1005. Marble and alabaster quarries are&nbsp;worked in the neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mentioned in the Itineraries, Rossano </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Rosrianum)</span><span class="font1"> appears under the Latin empire as one of the important fortresses of&nbsp;Calabria. Totila took it in 548. The people showed great&nbsp;attachment to the Byzantine empire. In the 14th century&nbsp;Rossano was made a principality for the grep,t family of De&nbsp;Baux. Passing to the Sforza, and thus to Sigismund of Poland,&nbsp;it was united in 1558 to the crown of Naples by Philip II.&nbsp;of Spain in virtue of a doubtful will by Bona of Poland in&nbsp;favour of Giovanni Lorenzo Pappacoda. Under Isabella of&nbsp;Aragon and Bona of Poland the town had been a centre of&nbsp;literary culture; but under the Spaniards it declined. The&nbsp;crown sold the lordship in 1612 to the Aldobrandini, and from&nbsp;them it passed to the Borghesi and the Caraffa. Rossano is&nbsp;best known as the birthplace of St Nilus the younger, whose&nbsp;life is the most valuable source of information extant in regard&nbsp;to the state of matters in southern Italy in the 10th century.&nbsp;Pope John VII. (705-7) was also a native of the town.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROSSBACH, a village of Prussian Saxony in the-district of Merseburg, 8 m. S.W. of that place and N.W. of Weissenfels,&nbsp;famous as the scene of Frederick the Great’s victory over the&nbsp;allied French and the army of the Empire on the 5th of November&nbsp;1757. For the events preceding the battle see Seven Years’&nbsp;War. The Prussian camp on the morning of the 5th lay&nbsp;between Rossbach (left) and Bedra (right), facing the Allies,&nbsp;who, commanded by the French general, Charles de Rohan,&nbsp;prince de Soubise (1715-1787), and Joseph Frederick William,&nbsp;duke of Saxe-Hildburghausen (1702-1787), General Feldzeug-meister of the Empire, had manoeuvred in the preceding days&nbsp;without giving Frederick an opportunity to bring them to&nbsp;action, and now* lay to the westward, with their right near&nbsp;Branderoda and their left at Mücheln (see sketch). The&nbsp;advanced posts of the Prussians were in the villages immediately&nbsp;west of their camp, those of the Allies on the Schortau hill and&nbsp;the Galgenberg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thei Allies possessed a numerical superiority of two to one in the battle itself, irrespective of detachments,@@<sup>1</sup> and their&nbsp;advanced post overlooked all parts of Frederick’s camp. They&nbsp;had had the best of it in the manœuvres of the previous days,&nbsp;and the duke of Hildburghausen determined to take the offensive. He had some difficulty, however, in inducing Soubise&nbsp;to risk a battle, and the Allies did not begin to move off their&nbsp;camping-ground until after eleven on the 5th, Soubise’s intention&nbsp;being probably to engage as late in the day as possible, with the</span></p>
