<p><span class="font1">RUSS, a small island in the Eastern Seas, near the west coast of Nassau. Long. 99. 48. E. Lat. 2. 53. S.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUSSELL, William, a very popular historian, the eldest son of Alexander Russell and Christian Ballantyne, was born in the year 1741 at Windydoors, a farm-house in the&nbsp;parish of Stowe and county of Selkirk. Most of the parish&nbsp;is within the limits of the county of Edinburgh. At an&nbsp;early age he was sent to school in the neighbouring village&nbsp;of Inverleithen, well known as a delightful place of summer resort. Here he acquired an elementary knowledge&nbsp;of the Greek and Latin languages ; and private study afterwards enabled him to supply many of the deficiencies of&nbsp;his early education. In 1756 he was removed to Edinburgh,&nbsp;in order to be instructed in writing and arithmetic ; and&nbsp;after having attended to these branches for about ten months,&nbsp;he was bound an apprentice to the bookselling and printing&nbsp;business for the term of five years. While engaged in this&nbsp;occupation, he discovered the utmost ardour in literary pursuits ; nor was his situation unfavourable to the acquisition&nbsp;of useful and elegant knowledge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After the completion of his apprenticeship, he published </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">select collection of modern poems, which was favourably&nbsp;received. The first edition we have not seen ; the second&nbsp;bears the subsequent title: “ The select Poems of our most&nbsp;celebrated contemporary British Poets : viz. Dr Akenside,&nbsp;Mr Gray, Mr Mason, W. Shenstone, Esq. Mr W. Collins, Lord&nbsp;Lyttelton, Mess. Wartons, Mr Blacklock, Mr Beattie, Mr&nbsp;Ogilvie, etc. Vol.I. Second edition, with additions.” Edinb.&nbsp;1764, 12mo. He afterwards congratulated himself on having contributed to extend the popularity of Gray and Shenstone in the northern part of the kingdom. It may be&nbsp;mentioned as a proof of his classical taste, that at this early&nbsp;period of life he entertained the highest admiration for the&nbsp;sublime odes of Gray, which he was accustomed to recite in&nbsp;a wild and enthusiastic manner. In the year 1763, while&nbsp;employed as a journeyman printer, he became a member of&nbsp;a literary association, denominated the Miscellaneous Society, which was composed of students and other young men&nbsp;anxious to exercise their talents and to improve their taste.&nbsp;This juvenile society included other individuals who afterwards rose to distinction. Among these we find Sir Robert&nbsp;Liston, who was employed in several important embassies,&nbsp;and Mr Dalzel, who became professor of Greek in this university.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">About the same period he made an attempt to adapt Crebillon’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhadamisthe el Zenobie</span><span class="font1"> to the English stage. The manuscript was submitted to the inspection of his two&nbsp;friends Liston and Dalzel; who, after a very careful perusal, stated not a few objections to particular passages, though&nbsp;they do not appear to have condemned the entire performance. This tragedy was at length offered to Garrick: but&nbsp;Murphy’s Zenobia was at that time in rehearsal; and if the&nbsp;merit of Russell’s play had been more conspicuous, it probably would not have been accepted. In 1764, he issued&nbsp;proposals for publishing a second volume of his collection&nbsp;of poems, which however did not make its appearance. With&nbsp;the view of arranging his materials, he now retired to the&nbsp;country, and about this period of his life he maintained an&nbsp;epistolary correspondence with Lord Elibank, Dr Ogilvie,&nbsp;and Mr Dalzel, by all of whom he seems to have been regarded as a young man of promising talents. In the course&nbsp;of the ensuing year, Lord Elibank, who was himself a man&nbsp;of literature, invited him to his seat in the county of Haddington, where he spent the greater part of the autumn, and&nbsp;had an opportunity of conversing with many distinguished&nbsp;individuals. To this nobleman he seems to have looked for&nbsp;favour and protection. The hope of obtaining preferment&nbsp;through his influence, had induced him to relinquish his&nbsp;original employment; and in the mean time he continued&nbsp;to prosecute his studies, particularly in the departments of&nbsp;history and polite literature.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">Having resided with his father till the month of May 1767, he proceeded to London in quest of honour and emolument. But his high hopes were speedily blasted; and&nbsp;after having in vain waited for advancement through the&nbsp;influence of Mr Hume, Lord Elibank, General Murray,&nbsp;and Governor Johnstone, he was under the necessity of&nbsp;contracting his views, and engaging himself as a corrector&nbsp;of the press in the great office of William Strahan, afterwards printer to his majesty. To find himself thus placed&nbsp;in a situation so inadequate to his expectations, must have&nbsp;cast a temporary gloom over his mind ; but the freshness&nbsp;of youth, added to the natural vivacity of his mind, would&nbsp;have enabled him to support even greater disappointments.&nbsp;In some brief notices found among his papers after his&nbsp;death, he mentions his expectations of preferment through&nbsp;the interest of these individuals; but he does not aver that&nbsp;his hopes were founded on their promises. The disappointments of human life may very frequently be traced to&nbsp;the unreasonableness of our expectations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the year 1769 he quitted the employment of Mr Strahan, and was engaged as overseer of the printing&nbsp;office of Brown and Adlard. During the same year he&nbsp;published an “ Ode to Fortitude,” which was immediately&nbsp;reprinted at Edinburgh by his former masters, Martin and&nbsp;Wotherspoon. His “ Sentimental Tales” appeared in 1770;&nbsp;and from this time he contributed to the periodical publications many essays in prose as well as verse. In 1772 he&nbsp;published a collection of “Fables, Moral and Sentimental,”&nbsp;and “An Essay on the Character, Manners, and Genius of&nbsp;Women, from the French of M. Thomas.” In 1774 he&nbsp;produced an octavo volume under the title of “ Julia, a&nbsp;Poetical Romance.” Of this work, which is founded on&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nouvelle Heloise</span><span class="font1"> of Rousseau, neither the plan nor the&nbsp;execution can be commended. In the estimate of his literary character Russell dissented from the public opinion :&nbsp;his historical works, which have met with a very favourable&nbsp;reception, he considered as greatly inferior to his poetical&nbsp;works, which have been totally neglected. But his friends&nbsp;certainly had no reason to regret that the collective edition&nbsp;of his poems, which he long meditated, never made its appearance. On the death of Hume he produced an elegy&nbsp;which occasioned a sarcastic effusion from another poet.&nbsp;Mickle, who abhorred the scepticism of Hume, and who&nbsp;believed himself to have been materially injured by Smith,&nbsp;concludes his verses with this stanza:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For him shall Russell rant and rave</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In hobbling rumbling lays ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And Smith in barbarous sleepy prose</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Shall grunt and croak his praise.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Russell is the author of the verses on the death of Dr Armstrong, subscribed W. R. and dated from Gray’s Inn,&nbsp;Sept. 10, 1779, which are commonly printed with the poems&nbsp;of that classical writer. Before this period he had apparently relinquished his connexion with the printing-office,&nbsp;and had entirely devoted himself to the pursuits of literature. His “ History of America,” published in numbers, was&nbsp;completed in the course of the same year. This work was&nbsp;received with some degree of favour ; hut the splendid merit&nbsp;of Dr Robertson’s history precluded all competition. During the same year, 1779, he likewise published, in octavo,&nbsp;the first two volumes of“ The History of Modern Europe;&nbsp;with an account of the Decline and Fall of the Roman&nbsp;Empire, and a View of the Progress of Society from the&nbsp;fifth to the eighteenth century. In a Series of Letters from&nbsp;a Nobleman to his Son.” Their reception was so favourable as to exceed his most sanguine expectations. His&nbsp;studies experienced a temporary interruption in 1780, when&nbsp;he embarked for Jamaica in order to recover some money,&nbsp;due to him as the heir of his brother James, who, after </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">residence of several years, had died in that island. He after-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
