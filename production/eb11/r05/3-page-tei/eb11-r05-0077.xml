There are gymnasia, or grammar schools of four classes, roughly corresponding with the German sub-gymnasia ; and lyceums of eight classes, which answer to the German gymnasia. Up to the fourth class all pupils are. taught alike in the lyceums; in the fifth, however, they are divided into a literary or “ humanist ” section, and a scientific or “ realist ” section. The four upper classes are taught French and German.; English and Italian being added for the “ realists,” Greek and Latin for the “ humanists.” Technical instruction is given in the agricultural schools; in various arts and crafts institutes, such as those of Bucharest and Jassy; in the veterinary and engineering colleges of Bucharest; in numerous commercial schools, and in schools of domestic economy for girls. In 1909-10 there were four ecclesiastical seminaries, seven training schools for teachers and eight military schools. The cost of education is largely borne by the communes, as well as by the state. At Bucharest and Jassy there are universities with faculties of law, philosophy, science and medicine and theology.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Antiquities.</hi>—The history of primitive civilization in Rumania can be traced back to the Neolithic Age; numerous remains of this period have been found at Vodastra in the Romanatzi department. Roman rule left a deep imprint on the. country. The following .Roman towns have been identified.: (1) in the Dobrudja, Cius (Hirsovab Troësmis (Iglitza), Arrubium (Machin)., .Viodunum (lsakcha), Istrus (Karaharman), Tropaeum (Adam Klissi), Kallatis(Mangalia), Tomi (Constantza) ; (2) in Moldavia, Dinogetia (Tiglina); (3) in Walachia, Drobetae (Turnu Severin), Malya (Celeiu), Castra Nova (Craiova), Romula (Resca), Sori.um (Roshiori de Vedc), Pelendava (Bradesci), Acidava (Jenuseshti), Rusidâva (Draga^ani), Castra Traiana (Râmnicu Vâlcea), Arutela (Bivolari), Pons Vetus. (Caineni), Komidava (Petroasa), Ramidava (Buzeu). A great military road encircled the Dobruaja hills and skirted the Bulgarian shore of the Danube. It was linked by a ferry at. Celeiu to two lesser roads; one striking northwards into Transylvania, up the Olt valley, the other bending westwards until it reached the Jiu, and there diverging southwards to Turnu Severin, and northwards to the Vulcan Pass. The plains near the Olt and Jiu estuaries are rich in Roman remains, notably in the towns of Caracal, Grodjibod and Islaz. Ruins and inscriptions may be seen at.Resca, a temple at Slaveni., villas and a statue of the emperor Commodus (a.d. 161-92) at Celeiu. All these lie within a radius of 60 m. Two ramparts, known as Trajan’s wall, can be discerned, one on either side of the railway from Cernavoda to Constantza; and there were bridges over the Danube at Turnu Severin and Turnu Magurele. The <hi rend="italic">Tropaeum Trajani,</hi>  or Adam Klissi monument (found near Rassova in the Dobrudja and removed to Bucharest museum), is a round stone structure of 100 ft. circumference and 40 ft. high, carved in low relief with scenes representing Trajan’s conquest of Dacia. (See G. Tocilescu, <hi rend="italic">Das Monument von Adam Klissi,</hi>  Vienna, 1895.) Few monuments were left by the barbarian invaders who ravaged Rumania from the 3rd century to the 14th save some vestiges of Gothic culture at Buzeu, and at Petroasa, close by. The celebrated treasure of Petroasa (commonly written Petrossa), preserved in Bucharest museum, consists of embossed and jewelled gold plate, and probably dates from the 6th century (see Plate). Medieval tapestries, with ecclesiastical vestments, ornaments and some fine pieces of early woodwork, are also preserved in Bucharest museum. The attempt to create a national style of architecture, based on Greek and Byzantine models, began under Stephen the Great of Moldavia (1457-1504), lasting until the 17th century, when it was arrested, first by political disorders, and, later, by the commercial development which caused a demand for cheap and rapid building. Its chief accomplishment is the cathedral of Curtea de Argesh (g.r.). Painting and sculpture, like modern Rumanian architecture, are still in their infancy.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography.—A list of the numerous statistical and other official publications issued at Bucharest in Rumanian or French is given yearly in </hi><hi rend="italic">Annual statistic al Romdniei.</hi>  The final results of the census of 1899 were published by the ministry of agriculture in 1905, with introduction by Dr L.

From the 6th to the 12th century, w</hi><hi rend="sup">T</hi>ave after wave of barbarian conquerors, Goths, Tatars, Slavs and. others, passed over the country, and, according to one school of historians, almost obliterated its original Daco-Roman population; the modern Vlachs, on this theory, representing a later body of immigrants from Transdanubian territory. According to others, the ancient inhabitants were, at worst, only submerged for a time, and their direct descendants are the Rumans of to-day. Each of these conflicting views is supported by strong evidence; and the whole controversy, too large and too obscure for discussion here, is considered under the heading Vlachs.</p><p>Towards the close of the 13th century, Walachia and Moldavia were occupied by a mixed population, composed partly of Vlachs, but mainly of Slavs and Tatars; in Great Walachia,@@<hi rend="sup">1 </hi>also called Muntenia, the Petchenegs and Cumanians predominated. Rumanian historians have striven, by piecing together the stray fragments of evidence which survive, to prove that their Vlach ancestors had not, as sometimes alleged, been reduced to a scattered community of nomadic shepherds, dwelling among the Carpathians as the serfs of their more powerful neighbours. The researches of Ila^dcu, Xenopol and other historians tend to show the existence of a highly organized Vlach society in Transylvania, Oltland and certain districts of Hungary’ and Moldavia; of a settled commonalty, agricultural rather than pastoral; and of a hereditary feudal nobility, bound to pay tribute and render military service to the Hungarian crown, but enjoying many privileges, which were defined by a distinct customary law<hi rend="italic">(jus valahicum).</hi>  Although the characteristic titles of <hi rend="italic">voivode, knez </hi>and <hi rend="italic">ban</hi>  (all implying military as well as civil authority) are of Slavonic origin, and perhaps derived from the practice of the later Bulgarian (or Bulgaro-Vlachian) empire, the growth of Vlach feudal institutions is attributed to German influences, which permeated through Hungarian channels into the Vlach world, and transformed the primitive tribal chiefs into a feudal aristocracy of <hi rend="italic">boiars</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">boyards</hi>@@<hi rend="italic">2</hi>(nobles).</p><p>With the 13th century, at latest, begins the authentic political history of the Vlachs in Rumania, but it is not the history of a united people. The two principalities of Walachia and Moldavia developed separately, and each has its separate annals. About the year 1774 it first becomes possible to trace the progress of these Danubian Principalities in a single narrative, oving to the uniform system of administration adopted by the Turkish authorities, and the rapid contemporary growth of a national consciousness among the Vlachs. At last, in 1859, the two principalities were finally united under the name of Rumania. The subjoined history of the country is arranged under the four headings: <hi rend="italic">Walachia, Moldavia,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Danubian Principalities</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Rumania,</hi>  in order to emphasize this historical development.</p><p>(2) <hi rend="italic">Walachia.—</hi>Tradition, as embodied in a native chronicle of the 16th century, entitled the <hi rend="italic">History of the Ruman Land since the arrival of the Rumans (Istoria lieret Romdntscl de c&amp;ndu au desedlieata Romdnil),</hi>  gives a precise account of the founding of the Walachian state by Radu Negru, or Rudolf the Black (otherwise known as Negru Voda, the Black Prince), voivode of the Rumans of Fogaras in Transylvania, who in 1290 descended with a numerous people into the Transalpine plain and established his capital first at C&amp;mpulung and then at Curtea de Argesh. Radu dies in 1310, and is succeeded by a series of voivodes whose names and dates are duly given; but this early chapter of Walachian history has been rudely handled by critical historians.
