In men of this denomination, there was almost of necessity the most complete blending of abject sycophancy to the emperor, with despotic tyranny and insolence to all his subjects.</p><p>Not long after the death of Messalina, Claudius married his own niece, Agrippina, daughter of Germanicus, a woman of strong natural abilities, but of insatiable avarice, extreme ambition, and remorseless cruelty. Her influence over the feeble emperor was boundless, and was displayed in the most glaringly ostentatious manner. She prevailed on him at last to set aside his own son Britannicus, and to adopt her son, Domitius Ahenobarbus, by her former husband, giving him the name by which he is best known, Nero, and constituting him heir to the imperial throne. To secure the succession in this channel, she gained over Burrhus, præfect of the prætorian bands, to whom she entrusted the charge of the youthful aspirant, thus giving him a reason to maintain his fidelity to one over whom he was sure to obtain influence. But Claudius having shewn some disposition to change the succession, and to restore it to Britannicus, Agrippina caused him to be poisoned by one of his own slavish favourites. His death was concealed by the empress till she had completed all her machinations for securing the throne to her son, who was then produced to receive the congratulations of his subjects.</p><p>Nero Claudius Cæsar, through the devices of his mother, and by the support of the prætorian guard, ascended the vacant throne at the early age of seventeen. During the first four or five years of his reign, he acted generally under the advice ofhis tutor, Seneca the philosopher, and Burrhus, præfect of the prætorian guard, and for that period he maintained a comparatively favourable character. The turbulent and ambitious conduct of his mother gave him great annoyance ; and the opposition which she experienced from Seneca and Burrhus, together with the mortification of perceiving the rapid decline of her influence over her son, served only to stimulate her to more dangerous and wicked conduct. She threatened to excite a revolution in behalf of Britannicus, son of the late emperor ; and this was the signal for the murder of the unfortunate youth, by the orders of Nero. The depravity of Nero was now beginning to shew itself. Poppæa Sabina, a woman of infamous character but of great beauty, had acquired greater influence over him than was possessed by either his mother or his sage counsellors, Seneca and Burrhus. A hideous rivalry began between this aspiring woman and Agrippina. To secure her influence, Poppæa instigated Nero to the murder of his mother; and to recover her power, Agrippina began to amass wealth, bribe the troops, and prepare measures for a conspiracy against the life of her own son. At length Poppæa prevailed, and Nero gave orders that his mother should be put to death, which was perpetrated while she lay asleep. After her murder, the monster himself gazed on the dead body, and expressed his admiration of her beauty.</p><p>He soon afterwards divorced his wife Octavia, daughter of Claudius, and married the infamous Poppæa. The death of Burrhus, which happened about the same time, gave him an opportunity of raising to the command of the prætorian guards a man whose disposition was more congenial to his own, Tigellinus, the corrupt and bloody tool of a depraved, licentious, and cruel tyrant. In his early youth Nero had paid some attention to the study of music, and even of poetry; and his excessive vanity led him to be covetous of public applause as a musician. He first exhibited publicly on the stage at Naples ; and being extremely gratified with the vehement applause that followed his performance, he frequently afterwards appeared in the theatres, and played on his lute, in the guise of a common musician. In a tour through Greece he received such unbounded applause, conveyed in such flattering terms by the polished natives, that he declared none but Greeks were worthy to hear him play and sing. Yet from these skilful flatterers he exacted the most oppressive contributions, for the supply of his lavish prodigalities.</p><p>During his reign the war in Britain was renewed, under the command of the brave and skilful Suetonius Paulinus. This politic commander, perceiving the influence which the Druids exercised over their countrymen, determined to put to death the whole druidical order, and to extirpate their religion. For this purpose he seized upon and devastated the isle of Mona, or Anglesey, their chief seat, cut down the sacred groves, and burned numbers of the Druids on their own blood-stained altars, and with their own homicidal fires. While he was thus engaged, a general insurrection of the conquered province broke out in consequence of the barbarous outrages inflicted on Boadicea, queen ofthe Iceni. Instigated by her wrongs, the natives everywhere flew to arms, destroyed several Roman stations, and among others the considerable colony of Verulamium (St. Alban’s). Not less than 70,00( persons are said to have fallen victims to their vengeance Suetonius hastened back to the support of his countrymen, and defeated the insurgent Britons with terrible slaughter. He was soon afterwards recalled by Nero, and tlle war in Britain was for a time suffered to languish.</p><p>In the tenth or eleventh year of Nero’s reign, Rome was : visited by a vast and dreadful conflagration, which continued for six successive days, and laid waste the greater part of the city. Nero himself gazed on the progress of the devouring element with a strange and wild delight, reciting aloud in a theatrical manner some verses descriptive of the destruction of Troy. Great numbers of the people, and immense treasures perished in this conflagration, which, partly from his conduct at the time, and partly from some expressions which fell from him a short time before, Nero himself was suspected of having caused. To remove the odium of this dreadful suspicion, Nero not only began to rebuild the city in greater splendour than before, maintaining meanwhile the homeless inhabitants at his own expense, but also caused the Christians, who were now become numerous, to be accused of having set the city on fire. This false accusation caused the first persecution of the Christians, in which great numbers were put to death with tortures of unprecedented cruelty. The details of this bloody persecution come, however, more properly within the province of the ecclesiastical historian. Availing himself of the space left unoccupied by the devastations of the flames, Nero indulged his extravagant disposition in the erection of his celebrated golden palace, of which the dimensions were prodigious, and the materials so costly as to drain the wealth of an empire. To replenish his treasury, he exacted the most oppressive tribute from the provinces, and thus excited a spirit of strong disaffection, which at no distant period threatened almost the dissolution of the empire.</p><p>In the mean time a conspiracy at Rome, headed by Piso, was detected before it was ripe for execution. This gave occasion to Nero to display the worst qualities of his ferocious mind. Not only all who were really implicated in the conspiracy were put to death without mercy, and their effects confiscated to the use of the emperor, but great numbers were doomed to similar destruction for no other apparent cause than because they were wealthy, or in some manner had incurred the dislike of the tyrant. In this wholesale butchery perished the philosopher Seneca, and the poet Lucan, with many others of the best and noblest men of Rome.</p><p>Notwithstanding these horrible barbarities, Nero was almost a favourite with the corrupt and mercenary populace. A very large proportion of the inhabitants of Rome had been accustomed, even from the turbulent days of the Gracchi, to be supported almost solely by the donations and</p></body></text></TEI>
