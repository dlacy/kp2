<p><span class="font0">RESEDA, dyer’s-weed, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tel low-wee cl, Weld,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wild-w∏ad :</span><span class="font0"> A genus of the order oftrigynia, belonging&nbsp;to the dodecandria clafs of plants ; and in the natural&nbsp;method- ranking' under the 54th order, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mi(celhιne&lt;e,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The-calyx is monophy!lous and partite ; the petals lan-ciniated ; the capfule unilocular, and opening at the&nbsp;mouth. There are 11 ſpecies ; of which the moſt remarkable is the hιteola or common dyer’s weed, growing naturally in waſte places in many parts of Britain.&nbsp;The young leaves are often undulated ; the ſtalk is a-yard high, or more, terminated with along naked ſpike&nbsp;of yellowiſh-green flowers : the plant is cultivated and&nbsp;much uied for dying lilk and wool of a yellow colour.&nbsp;The great recommendation of the plant is, that it will&nbsp;grow with very little trouble, without dung, and on the&nbsp;very worſt foils. For this reaſon it is commonly ſown&nbsp;with, or immediately after, barley or oats, without any&nbsp;additional care, except drawing a buſh over it to harrow&nbsp;it in. The reaping of the corn does it little or no hurt,&nbsp;as it grows but little the firſt year ; and the next ſummer&nbsp;it is pulled and dried like flax. Much care and nicety,&nbsp;however, is requiiite, ſo as not to injure either the&nbsp;feed or ſtalk; or, which ſometimes happens, damaging both, by letting it ſtand too long, or pulling it&nbsp;too green. To avoid theſe inconveniences, a better&nbsp;method of culture has been deviſed. This new method is to plough and harrow the ground very fine,,&nbsp;without dung, as equally as poſſible, and then ſowing&nbsp;about a gallon of ſeed, which is very ſmall, upon an&nbsp;acre, ſome time in the month of Auguſt. In about&nbsp;two months it vzill be high enough to hoe, which&nbsp;muſt be carefully done, and the plants left about fix&nbsp;inches aſunder. Tn March it is to be hoed again, and&nbsp;this labour is to be repeated a third time in May.&nbsp;About the cloſe of June, when the flower is in full&nbsp;vigour, and the ſtalk is become of a greeniſh-yellow,&nbsp;it ſhould be pulled ; a ſufficient quantity of ſtems being left growing for ſeed till September. By this,&nbsp;means the flower and ſtalk, both of them being carefully dried, will lell at a good price to tlie dyers, who&nbsp;employ it conſtantly, and in large quantities ; add to&nbsp;this, tirat the ſeed being ripe and in perfect order, will&nbsp;yield a very confiderable profit. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">tolerable year,&nbsp;when the ſeaſons have not been unfavourable, the advantages derived from this vegetable will anſwer very&nbsp;well ; but if the ſummer ſhould be remarkably fine,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font0">proper </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">care is taken in getting it in, there </span><span class="font0">will </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">be&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">a very large produce upon an acre. The crop being,&nbsp;as has been ſhown, ſo early removed, the ground may&nbsp;be conveniently prepared for growing wheat the next&nbsp;year. Upon the whole, weld is in its nature a very&nbsp;valuable commodity in many reſpects, as it ſerves e-qually for woollen, linen, or filk ; dyeing not only a&nbsp;rich and laſting yellow, but alſo, properly managed, all&nbsp;the different ſhades of yellow with brightneſs and&nbsp;beauty ; and if theſe be previouſly dipped blue, they&nbsp;are by the weld changed into a very pleafing green,&nbsp;which our artiſts can alſo diverfify into a great variety&nbsp;of ſhades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RESEMBLANCE, ««//Dissimilitude, the rela-tions of likeneſs and difference among objects. See Comparison.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The connection that man hath with the beings around him, requires ſome acquaintance with their nature, their&nbsp;powers, and their qualities, for regulating his conduct.&nbsp;For acquiring a branch of knowledge ſo effential to our&nbsp;well-being, motives alone of reaſon and intereſt are not&nbsp;ſuſſicient : nature hath providentially ſuperadded curio-ſity, a vigorous propenſity, which never is at reſt. This&nbsp;propenfity alone attaches ns to every new object -j- ; and&nbsp;incites us to compare objects, in order to difcover their&nbsp;differences and reſemblances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Reſemblance among objects of the ſame kind, and diſſimilitude among objects of different kinds, are too&nbsp;obvious and familiar to gratify our curiofity in any de-gree : its· gratification lies in diſcovering differences&nbsp;among things where reſemblance prevails, and reſem-blances where difference prevails. Thus a difference,&nbsp;in individuals of the ſame kind of plants or animals, is&nbsp;deemed a diſcovery, while the many particulars in which&nbsp;they agree are neglected ; and in different kinds, any&nbsp;reſemblance is greedily remarked, without attending to&nbsp;the many particulars in which they differ,.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A compariſon of the former neither tends to gratify our curiofity, nor to ſct the objects compared in a ſtronger light : two apartments in. a palace, fimilar&nbsp;in ſhape, fize, and furniture, make feparately as good&nbsp;a figure as when compared ; and the lame obſervation&nbsp;is applicable to, two fimilar compartments in a garden ;&nbsp;on the other hand, oppoſe a regular building to a fall&nbsp;of water, or a good picture to.a towering hill, or even&nbsp;a little dog to a large horſe, and the contraſt will produce no effect. But a reſemblance between objects of&nbsp;different kinds, and a difference between objects of'&nbsp;the ſame kind, have remarkably an enlivening effect.&nbsp;Thc poets, filch of them as have a juft taſte, draw all&nbsp;their ſtmilies from things that in the main differ widely from the principal ſubject ; and they never attempt&nbsp;a contraſt, but where the things have a common ge-nus, and a reſemblance in the capital circumſtances :&nbsp;place together a large and a ſmall-ſized animal of the&nbsp;fame ſpecies, the one will appear greater, the other&nbsp;leſs, than when viewed feparately : when we oppoſe&nbsp;beauty to deformity, each makes a greater figure by&nbsp;the compariſon. λVe compare the drefs of different&nbsp;nations with curiofity, but without ſurpriſe becauſe,&nbsp;they have no ſuch refemblance in · the capital'parts as&nbsp;to pleaſe us. by contraſting the fmaller parts. But a&nbsp;new cut of a ∩eeve, or of a pocket, enchants by its&nbsp;novelty ; and, in oppoſition to the former faſhion, raiſes&nbsp;ſome degree of ſurpriſe.</span></p>
