(anc. geog.), an iſland at no great diſtance from the promontory Mycale, on the continent of the Hither Aſia, and oppoſite to Epheſus; the diſtance only ſeven ſtadia (Strabo); a free iſland, in compaſs 87 miles (Pliny); or 100 (Iſidorus): with a cognominal town (Ptolemy, Horace); famous for the worſhip and a temple of Juno, with a noted aſylum (Virgil, Strabo, Tacitus); and hence their coin exhibited a peacock (Athenæus): The country of Pythagoras, who, to avoid the oppreſſion of tyrants, retired to Italy, the land of freedom. Samos, though not ſo happy in producing wine, which Strabo wonders at, all the adjoining iſlands yielding a generous fort, yet abounds in all the neceſſaries of life. The <hi rend="italic">Vaſa Sarnia,</hi> among earthen ware, were held in high repute. <hi rend="italic">Samii,</hi> the people (Ovid). —The iſland is now in the hands of the Turks. It is about 32 miles in length, and 22 in breadth, and extremely fertile. The inhabitants live at their eaſe, their taxation by the Turks being moderate. The women are very naſty and ugly, and they never ſhift above once a month. They are clothed in the Turkiſh manner, except a red coif, and their hair hanging down their backs, with plates of ſilver or block-tin faſtened to the ends. — They have abundance of melons, lentils, kidney-beans, and excellent muſkadine grapes. They have white figs four times as big as the common fort, but not ſo well taſted. Their ſilk is very fine, and their honey and wax admirable; beſides which, their poultry are excellent: they have iron mines, and moſt of the foil is of a ruſty colour: they have alſo emery ſtone, and all the mountains are of white marble. The inhabitants are about 12, 000, who are almoſt all Greeks; and the monks and prieſts occupy moſt part of the iſland. They have a biſhop who reſides at Cora.
