<p><span class="font1">At the end of this volume there is a touching account of his life by the latter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G. Cu.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">RIENZI, COLA DI </span><span class="font1">(c. 1313-1354), tribune of the Roman people, was born in Rome, being the son of a tavern-keeper&nbsp;named Lorenzo Gabrini. His father’s Christian name was&nbsp;shortened to Rienzo, and his own, Nicholas, to Cola; hence the&nbsp;CoIa di Rienzi, or Rienzo, by which he is generally known. His&nbsp;early years were passed at Anagni. Having devoted much&nbsp;time to the study of the Latin writers, historians, orators and&nbsp;poets, and filled his mind with stories of the glories and the&nbsp;power of ancient Rome, he turned his thoughts to the task of&nbsp;restoring his native city to its pristine greatness, his zeal for&nbsp;this work being quickened by the desire to avenge his brother,&nbsp;who had been killed by a noble, a member of the ruling class.&nbsp;He became a notary and a person of some importance in the&nbsp;city, and was sent in 1343 on a public errand to Pope Clement&nbsp;VI. at Avignon. He discharged his duties with ability and&nbsp;success, and although the boldness with which he denounced&nbsp;the aristocratic rulers of Rome drew down upon him the enmity&nbsp;of powerful men, he won the favour and esteem of the pope, who&nbsp;gave him an official position at his court. Returning to Rome&nbsp;about April 1344 he worked for three years at the great object&nbsp;of his life, the restoration of the city to its former position of&nbsp;power. He gathered together a band of supporters, plans&nbsp;were drawn up, and at length all was ready for the rising. On&nbsp;the 19th of May 1347 heralds invited the people to a parliament&nbsp;on the Capitol, and on the 20th, the day being Whit-Sunday,&nbsp;the meeting took place. Dressed in full armour and attended&nbsp;by the papal vicar, Cola headed a procession to the Capitol;&nbsp;here he addressed the assembled crowd, speaking “ with&nbsp;fascinating eloquence of the servitude and redemption of&nbsp;Rome.” A new series of laws was published and accepted&nbsp;with acclaim, and unlimited authority was given to the author&nbsp;of the revolution. Without striking a blow the nobles left&nbsp;the city or went into hiding, and a few days later Rienzi took&nbsp;the title of tribune </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Nicholaus, severus et Clemens, libertatis,&nbsp;Pacisjusticiaeque tribunus, et sacre Romane Reiptiblice liberator).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His authority quickly and quietly accepted by all classes, the new ruler governed the city with a stern justice which was&nbsp;in marked contrast to the recent reign of licence and disorder.&nbsp;In great state the tribune moved through the streets of Rome,&nbsp;being received at St Peter’s with the hymn </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Veni Creator spiritus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">while in a letter the poet Petrarch urged him to continue his&nbsp;great and noble work, and congratulated him on his past&nbsp;achievements, calling him the new Camillus, Brutus and&nbsp;Romulus. In July in a sonorous decree he proclaimed the&nbsp;sovereignty of the Roman people over the empire, but before&nbsp;this he had set to work upon his task of restoring the authority&nbsp;of Rome over the cities and provinces of Italy, of making the&nbsp;city again </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">caput mundi.</span><span class="font1"> He wrote letters to the cities of Italy,&nbsp;asking them to send representatives to an assembly which&nbsp;would meet on the 1st of August, when the formation of a great&nbsp;federation under the headship of Rome would be considered.&nbsp;On the appointed day a number of representatives appeared,&nbsp;and after some elaborate and fantastic ceremonials Rienzi, as&nbsp;dictator, issued an edict citing the emperor Louis the Bavarian&nbsp;and his rival Charles, afterwards the emperor Charles IV., and&nbsp;also the imperial electors and all others concerned in the dispute,&nbsp;to appear before him in order that he might pronounce judgment&nbsp;in the case. On the following day the festival of the unity of&nbsp;Italy was celebrated, but neither this nor the previous meeting had any practical result. Rienzi’s power, however, was&nbsp;recognized in Naples, whence both Queen Joanna and her&nbsp;bitter foe, King Louis of Hungary, appealed to him for protection and aid, and on the 15th of August he was crowned&nbsp;tribune with great pomp, wreaths of flowers being placed on&nbsp;his head. Gregorovius says this ceremony “ was the fantastic&nbsp;caricature in which ended the imperium of Charles the Great.&nbsp;A world where political action was represented in such guise&nbsp;was ripe for overthrow, or could only be saved by a great&nbsp;mental reformation.” He then seized, but soon released,&nbsp;Stephen Colonna and some other barons who had spoken&nbsp;disparagingly of him. But his power was already beginning&nbsp;to wane. His extravagant pretensions only served to excite&nbsp;ridicule. His government was costly, and to meet its many&nbsp;expenses he was obliged to lay heavy taxes upon the people.&nbsp;He offended the pope by his arrogance and pride, and both pope&nbsp;and emperor by his proposal to set up a new Roman empire,&nbsp;the sovereignty of which would rest directly upon the will of&nbsp;the people. In October Clement gave power to a legate to&nbsp;depose him and bring him to trial, and the end was obviously&nbsp;in sight. Taking heart, the exiled barons gathered together&nbsp;some troops, and war began in the neighbourhood of Rome.&nbsp;Rienzi obtained aid from Louis of Hungary and others, and&nbsp;on the 20th of November his forces defeated the nobles in a&nbsp;battle just outside the gates of Rome, a battle in which the&nbsp;tribune himself took no part, but in which his most distinguished&nbsp;foe, Stephen Colonna, was killed. But this victory did not&nbsp;save him. He passed his time in feasts and pageants, while&nbsp;in a bull the pope denounced him as a criminal, a pagan and&nbsp;a heretic, until, terrified by a slight disturbance on the 15th of&nbsp;December, he abdicated and fled from Rome. He sought refuge&nbsp;in Naples, but soon he left that city and spent over two years&nbsp;in an Italian mountain monastery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Emerging from his solitude Rienzi journeyed to Prague, which he reached in July 1350, and threw himself upon the&nbsp;protection of the emperor Charles IV. Denouncing the temporal&nbsp;power of the pope he implored the emperor to deliver Italy,&nbsp;and especially Rome, from their oppressors; but, heedless of&nbsp;his invitations, Charles kept him in prison for more than a year&nbsp;in the fortress of Raudnitz, and then handed him over to&nbsp;Clement, who had been clamouring for his surrender. At&nbsp;Avignon, where he appeared in August 1352, Rienzi was tried&nbsp;by three cardinals, and was sentenced to death, but this judgment&nbsp;was not carried out, and he remained in prison in spite of&nbsp;appeals from Petrarch for his release. Freedom, however, was&nbsp;at hand. In December 1352 Clement died, and his successor,&nbsp;Innocent VI., anxious to strike a blow at the baronial rulers&nbsp;of Rome, and seeing in the former tribune an excellent tool&nbsp;for this purpose, pardoned and released his prisoner. Giving him&nbsp;the title of senator, he sent him to Italy with the legate, Cardinal&nbsp;Albornoz, and having collected a few mercenary troops on the&nbsp;way, Rienzi entered Rome in August 1354. IIe was received&nbsp;with great rejoicings and quickly regained his former position&nbsp;of power. But this latter term of office was destined to be&nbsp;even shorter than his former one had been. Having vainly&nbsp;besieged the fortress of Palestrina, he returned to Rome, where&nbsp;he treacherously seized the soldier of fortune, Fra Monreale,&nbsp;who was put to death, and where, by other cruel and arbitrary&nbsp;deeds, he soon lost the favour of the people. Their passions&nbsp;were quickly aroused and a tumult broke out on the 8th of&nbsp;October. Rienzi attempted to address them, but the building&nbsp;in which he stood was fired, and while trying to escape in&nbsp;disguise he was murdered by the mob. Rienzi was the hero&nbsp;of one of the finest of Petrarch’s odes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Spirito gentil,</span><span class="font1"> and also&nbsp;of some beautiful verses by Lord Byron. He was a man of&nbsp;vivid, but disordered, imagination, without possessing any&nbsp;conception of statesmanship. In 1887 a statue of the tribune&nbsp;was erected at the foot of the Capitoline Hill in Rome.</span></p>
