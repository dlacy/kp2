or Robert. See Robert.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rupert, prince palatine of the Rhine, &amp;c. ſon of Frederic prince elector palatine oſ the Rhine and Eliſabeth daughter to king James I of England, was born in 1619. He gave proofs of his bravery at the age of T 3 ; and in 1642 came over into England, and offered his ſervice to king Charles I. his uncle, who gave him a command in his army. At Edgehiſl he charged with incredible bravery, and made a great ſlaugſhter of the parliamentarians. In 1643 he ſeized the town of Cirenceiter ; obliged the governor of Litchfield to flirrender ; and having joined his brother prince Maurice, reduced Briſtol in three days, and paffed to the relief of Newark. In 1644 he marched to relieve York, where he gave the parliamentarians battle, arſd entirely defeated their right wing ; but Cromwell charged the marquis of Newcaſtle with ſuch an irreſiſtible force, that prince Rupert was entirely defeated. Atter this the prince put himſelf into Briſtol, which furrendered to Fairfax after a gallant refiſtance. The king was ſo enraged at the lofs of this city, ſo contrary to his expectation, that he recalled all prince Rupert’s commrſ-ſions, and ſent him a paſs to go out of the kingom In 1648 he went to France, was highly complimented by that court, and kindly received by king Charles II. who ſojourned there for the time. Afterward he was conſtituted admiral of the king’s navy ; inſeſted the Dutch ſhips, many of which he took ; and having engaged with De Ruyter, obliged him to fly. He died in 1682, and was interred in king Henry VII.’s chapel, Weftminfter, with great magnificence. Mr Grainger obſerves, that he poffeffed in a high degree that kind of courage which is better in an attack tl*an a defence ; and is leſs adapted to the land-ſervice than that of the ſea, where precipitate valour is in its element.</hi> He ſeldom engaged but he gained the advantage, which</p>

<p>he generally loſt by purſuing it too far. He was better qualified to ftorm a citadel, or even to mount a breach, than patiently to ſuſtain a fiege ; and would have furniſhed an excellent hand to a general of a cooler head. This prince is celebrated for the invention of prints in mezzotinto, of which he is ſaid to have taken the hint from a ſoldier’s ſcraping his ruſty fufil. The firſt print of this kind ever publiſhed was done by his highneſs, and may be ſeen in the firſt edition oſ Evelyn’s Sculptra. The ſecret is ſaid to have been ſoon after diſeovered by Sherwin an engraver, who made uſe of a loaded file for laying the ground. The prince, upon ſeeing one of his prints, ſuſpected that his ſervant had lent him his tool, which was a channeled roller ; but upon receiving full ſatisfaction to the contrary, he made him a preſent of it. The roller was afterwards laid aſide ; and an inſtrument with a crenelled edge, ſhaped like a ſhoemaker’s cutting-knife, was uſed inſtead of it. He alſo invented a metal called by his name, in which guns weι e caſt ; and contrived an excellent method of boring them, for which purpoſe a water-mill was erected at Hackney-marſh, to the great detriment of the undertaker, as the ſecret died with the illuſtrious inventor.</p><p><hi rend="italic">RUPERPs Drops,</hi> a fort of glaſs-drops with long and ſlender tails, which burſt to pieces on the breaking off thoſe tails in any part ; ſaid to have been invented by prince Rupert, and therefore called by his name. Concerning the cauſe of this ſurpriſing phenomenon ſcarce any thing that bears the leaſt appearance of probability has been offered. Their exploſion is attended in the dark with a flaſh of light ; and by being boiled in oil, the drops are deprived of their exploſive quality.</p>
