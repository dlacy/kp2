<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">feme of </span><span class="font0">the principal inhabitants </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">of that </span><span class="font0">iſland, by whpm he was ſo ſtrongly recommended to th¢ biſhop of Lon-don, that on his coming home with Sir Charles Mid-dleton, who warmly joined in the recommendation, he&nbsp;was admitted into orders ; after which he immediate-ly returned to St Chriſtopher’s, where hc was preſent-¢d by the governor to two rectories, valued at 70ol. a-year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As ſooh as he took poſſeſſion of his livings, in 1763, he married Mifs Rebecca Akers, thc daughter of a&nbsp;planter of the beſt family-connections in the iſland, and&nbsp;began to regulate his houſehold on the pious plan incul-cated in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eſſay on the Treatment and Converfion oſ the&nbsp;African Slaves in the Britiſh Sugar Colonies.</span><span class="font0"> He ſummoned all his own ſlaves daily to the prayers of the fa-mily, when he took an opportunity of pointing out to&nbsp;them their duty in the plaineſt terms, reproving thoſe&nbsp;that had done amiſs, and commending ſuch as lrad ſhown&nbsp;any thing like virtue </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 </span><span class="font0">but he confeſſed that his occa-ſſons for reproof were more frequent than for commen-dation. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">As </span><span class="font0">became his office and character, he incul-cated upon others what he practiſed himſelf, and knew&nbsp;to be equally the duty of all. &quot; Οη his firſt fettlement&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">BS </span><span class="font0">a miniſter in the weſt Indies, he made ſome public&nbsp;attempts to inſtruct ſlaves. PIe began to draw up ſome&nbsp;caſy, plain diſcourſes for their inſtruction. He invited&nbsp;them to attend on Sundays, at particular hours. He&nbsp;appointed hours at home to inſtruct ſuch ſenſible ſlaves as&nbsp;would of themſelves attend. He repeatedly exhorted their&nbsp;maſters to encourage ſuch in their attendance. He re-commended the French cuſtom, of beginning and ending work by prayer. But inconceivable is the liſtleſſ-neſs with which he was heard, and bitter was the cenſure heaped on him in return. It was quickly ſuggeſt.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">ed, </span><span class="font0">and generally believed, that he wanted to interrupt&nbsp;the work of ſlaves, to give them time, forſooth, to ſay&nbsp;their prayers ; that he aimed at the making of them&nbsp;Chriſtians, to render them incapable of being good&nbsp;ſlaves. In one word, he ſtood, in opinion, a rebel con</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vict </span><span class="font0">againſt the intereſt and majeſty of planterſhip. And&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">as </span><span class="font0">the Jews ſay, that in every puniſhment, with which&nbsp;they have been proved, ſince the bondage of Egypt,&nbsp;there has been an ounce of the golden caff of Horeb ;&nbsp;ſo might he ſay, that in every inſtance of prejudice (and&nbsp;they were not a few) with which, till within a year or&nbsp;two of his departure from the country, he was exerci-fed, there was an ounce of his fruitleſs attempts to improve the minds of ſlaves,, In the bidding prayer, he&nbsp;had inferted a petition for the converfion of thoſe per-ſons. But it was deemed ſo diſagreeable a memento, that&nbsp;ſeveral white people, on account oſ it, left off attending&nbsp;divine ſervice. He was obliged to omit the prayer entirely, to try and bring them back. In ſhort, neither&nbsp;were the ſlaves, at that time, deſirous oſ being taught,&nbsp;«or were their maſters inclined to encourage them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That he was hurt by this neglect cannot be queſtion-ed, for he had a mind benevolent, warm, and irritable ; but he ſtill retained many friends amongſt the moſt wor-</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">thy </span><span class="font0">members of the community : and as he was confci-ous of having done nothing more than his duty, he con-foled himſelf with reflecting, that thofe are &quot; bleffed&nbsp;whom men revile, and perſecute, and ſpeak all manner&nbsp;of evil againſt falſely, for the ſake of the goſpel.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although his ſerious ſtudies were now theological, ⅛C conſidered himſelf as anſwerable to God, his country,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font0">his own family, for a proper uſe of every branch of knowledge which he poſſeſſed. He therefore took the&nbsp;charge of ſever al plantations around him in the capacity of a medical practitioner ; and attended them with&nbsp;unremitting diligence, and with great ſucceſs. Thus he&nbsp;lived<sub>l</sub> till the year 1777, when relinquiſhing the practice&nbsp;of phyſic entirely, he paid a viſit to the place of his na-tivity, which he had not feen ſince 1755. mother,&nbsp;whofe latter days he had made comfortable by a handſome annuity, had been dead for fome years ; but he re-warded all who had been attentive to her, or in early&nbsp;life ferviceable to himſelf ; and he continued the penſion&nbsp;to a ſiſter who had a numerous family, for which kv*&nbsp;huſhand was unable to provide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After remaining three weeks in Scotland, and near a year in England, during which time he was admitted&nbsp;into the confidence of Lord George Germaine, ſecre-tary of ſtate for the American department, Mr Ramſay was appointed chaplain to Admiral Barrington,&nbsp;then going out to take a command in the weſt In-dies. Under this gallant officer, and afterwards under Lord Rodney, he was preſent at ſeveral engage-ments, where he diſplayed a fortitude and zeal for thc&nbsp;honour of his country which would not have diſgraeed&nbsp;the oldeſt admiral. To the navy, indeed, he ſeems to&nbsp;have been ſtrongly attached ; and he wrote, at an early&nbsp;period of his life, an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fffαy on the Duty and Qualifications&nbsp;of a Sea-officer,</span><span class="font0"> with ſuch a knowledge of the fervice&nbsp;as would have done honour to the pen of the moſt ex-perienced commander, of the firſt edition of this eſſay&nbsp;the profits were by its benevolent author appropriated&nbsp;to the Magdalen and Britiſh lying-in hofpitals, as thoſe&nbsp;of the fecond and third (which laſt was publiſhed about&nbsp;the period of which we now write) were to the maritime&nbsp;ſchool, or, in the event of its failure, to the marine ſociety.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although careſſed by both the admirals under whom he ſerved, and having ſuch influence with the latter as&nbsp;to be able to render eſſential fervices to the Jews and&nbsp;other perfons whom he thought harſhly treated at the&nbsp;capture of<sup>,</sup>St Euſtatius, Mr Ramſay once more quitted&nbsp;the ſea-ſervice, and retired to his paſtoral charge in the&nbsp;Iſland of St Chriſtopher’s. There, however, though the&nbsp;former animoſities againſt him had entirely ſubſided, and&nbsp;though his friendſhip was now ſolicited by every perfon&nbsp;of conſequence in the iſland, he remained but a little&nbsp;while. Sick of the life of a planter and of the pro-ſpect of ſlavery around him, he reſigned' his livings,&nbsp;bade adieu to the iſland, and returned to England with&nbsp;his wife and family in the end of the year 1781. Immediately on his arrival, he was, through the intereſt&nbsp;of his ſteady friend Sir Charles Middleton, preſented to&nbsp;the livings of Teſton and Nettleſtead in the county of&nbsp;Kent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Here he was ſoon determined, by the advice of thoſe whom he moſt reſpected, to publiſh an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fiſſiy,</span><span class="font0"> which had&nbsp;been written many years before, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">on the Treatment and&nbsp;Converfion oſ African Slaves in the Britijh Sugar Colonies.</span><span class="font0"> The controveiſy in which this publication invol-ved him, and the acrimony with which it was carried&nbsp;on, are ſo freſh in the memory of all our readers, that&nbsp;no man who thinks of the narrow limits within which&nbsp;our biographical articles muſt be confined, will blame&nbsp;us for not entering into a detail of the particulars.-—&nbsp;Torrents of obloquy were poured upon the benevolent&nbsp;author by writers who were unfair enough to conceal</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
