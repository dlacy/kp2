<p><label>RECTIFIER</label>
in navigation, an inſtrument conſiſt-ing of two parts, which are two circles, either laid one upon, or let into the other, and ſo faſtened together in their centres, that they repreſent two compaffes, one fixed, the other moveable ; each of them divided into the 32 points of the compaſs, and 360 <hi rend="sup">o</hi> , and numbered both ways, from the north and the ſouth, ending at the eaſt and weſt, in 90 <hi rend="sup">c</hi> .</p><p>The fixed compaſs repreſents the horizon, in which the north and all the other points of the compaſs are fixed and immoveable.</p><p>The moveable compaſs repreſents the mariner’s com-paſs ; in which- the north and all other points are liable to variation.</p><p>In the centre of the moveable compaſs is faſtened.a filk thread, long enough to reach the outfide of the fixed compaſs. But if the inſtrument be made of wood, there is an index inſtead of the thread.</p><p>Its uſe is to find the variation of the compafs, to rectify the courſe at ſea ; having the amplitude or azi-muth given.</p>
