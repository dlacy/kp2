<p><span class="font1">The first member of the family of whom we have knowledge was Lorenzo, who, with his son Jacopo, made the ambones of S. Maria&nbsp;in Ara Coeli and an altar-canopy (eiborium) in SS. Apostoli. Jacopo&nbsp;decorated the door of S. Saba in 1205 and, together with his son&nbsp;Cosma (who gave his name to the family), that of.S. Tommaso in&nbsp;Formis; the father and son worked together at Civita Castellana&nbsp;in 1210. Cosma made a eiborium for SS. Giovanni e Paolo in 1235,&nbsp;and worked with his sons Luca and Jacopo at Anagni and Subiaco&nbsp;during the first half of the 13th century. So far. the inscriptions&nbsp;enable us to trace the relationships of the Cosmati with certainty;&nbsp;it is not so clear whether the Cosma above mentioned is to be&nbsp;identified with the master who decorated the chapel of the Sancta&nbsp;Sanctorum belonging to the old Latcran palace which was rebuilt&nbsp;by Nicholas III. (1277-1280). This Cosma was, however, almost&nbsp;certainly the father of Giovanni, the last of the family, who made&nbsp;the tombs of Cardinal Durand (died 1299) in S. Maria sopra Minerva,&nbsp;Cardinal Rodríguez in S. Maria Maggiore, and Stefano de* Surdi&nbsp;in S. Balbina. Another artist who seems to have belonged to this&nbsp;family, Deodato, made the ciboria of S. Maria in Cosmcdin and&nbsp;(prohably) of S. John Lateran; he is probably identical with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dcodatus filius Cosmati</span><span class="font1"> who, together with another Jacopo, executed&nbsp;a pavement at S. Jacopo alia Lungara. .A large number of other&nbsp;works of this school, but unsigned, exist in Rome. These are&nbsp;mainly altars and baldacchini, choir-screens, paschal candlesticks,&nbsp;ambones, tombs, and the like, all enriched with sculpture and glass&nbsp;mosaic of great brilliance and decorative effect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides the more mechanical sort of work, such as mosaic patterns and architectural decoration, they also produced mosaic pictures&nbsp;and sculpture of very high merit, especially the recumbent effigies,&nbsp;with angels standing at the head and foot, in the tombs </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">Ara&nbsp;Coeli, S. Maria Maggiore, and elsewhere. One of their finest works&nbsp;is in S. Cesáreo; this is a marble altar richly decorated with mosaic&nbsp;in sculptured panels, and (below) two angels drawing back a curtain&nbsp;(all in marble) so as to expose the open grating of the confessio.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Besides the Cosmati, other artists, such as Paulus Romanus and his sons in the 12th century, and Petrus Vassallectus in the 13th,&nbsp;contributed to the revival of art. The beautiful cloisters of&nbsp;S. Paolo fuori le Mura, begun by “ Magister Petrus,” and those of&nbsp;S. John Lateran, the work of Vassallectus, are the finest architectural&nbsp;works of this school. In the latter part of the 13th century we find&nbsp;the sculptor Arnolfo del Cambio at work in Rome. His altar-canopy at S. Paolo fuori le Mura (1285) seems to have been imitated&nbsp;by the Cosmati in their latest works; his tomb of Cardinal de Braye&nbsp;(d. 1282) at Orvieto also shows his intimate connexion with that&nbsp;school. Another artist of the same period, Petrus Oderisius,&nbsp;worked in England; the shrine of the Confessor at Westminster&nbsp;(1269) was made by him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The earlier works of the Cosmati are Romanesque in style, but in the 13th century Gothic elements were introduced, especially in&nbsp;the elaborate altar-canopies., with their geometrical tracery. In&nbsp;detail, however, they differ widely from the purer Gothic of northern&nbsp;countries. The richness of effect which the English or French&nbsp;architect obtained by elaborate and carefully worked mouldings&nbsp;was produced in Italy by the beauty of polished marbles and jewellike mosaics,—the details being mostly rather coarse and often&nbsp;carelessly executed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Chiefly to the 13th century belong the large number of beautiful campanili, which are the most conspicuous relics of&nbsp;the medieval period in Rome. The finest of these are&nbsp;attached to the churches of S. Francesca Romana,&nbsp;SS. Giovanni e Paolo, and S. Maria Maggiore. Others&nbsp;belong to the basilicas of S. Lorenzo fuori and S. Croce in Geru-salemme, and to S. Giorgio in Velabro, S. Maria in Cosmedin,&nbsp;S. Alessio, S. Giovanni ad Portam Latinam, S. Cecilia, S.&nbsp;Crisogono, and S. Pudentiana. They occupy various positions&nbsp;with regard to the church, being all later additions; that&nbsp;of SS. Giovanni e Paolo stands at some distance from it.&nbsp;In design they are very similar, consisting of many stages,&nbsp;divided by brick and marble cornices; in the upper storeys are&nbsp;from two to four windows on each side, with round arches&nbsp;supported on slender marble columns. They are decorated&nbsp;with brilliantly coloured </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ciotole</span><span class="font1"> or disks of earthenware, enamelled and painted in green or turquoise blue, among the&nbsp;earliest existing specimens of the so-called majolica (see&nbsp;Ceramics). Sometimes disks or crosses made of red or green&nbsp;porphyry are inlaid in the walls. In most cases on one face&nbsp;of the top storey is a projecting canopied niche, which once contained a statue or mosaic picture. The walls are built of fine&nbsp;neat brickwork. The largest and once the handsomest of all,&nbsp;that of S. Maria Maggiore, has string-courses of enamelled and&nbsp;coloured terra-cotta.<sup>@@1</sup> The slender columns of the windows</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">have often proved insufficient to support the weight, and so many of the arches are built up.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Though but little used for churches, the Gothic style, in its modified Italian form, was almost universally employed for&nbsp;domestic architecture in Rome during the 13th and&nbsp;14th centuries. Tufa<sup>@@3</sup> or brick was used for the&nbsp;main walls, the lowest storey being often supported&nbsp;on an arcade of pointed arches and marble columns. The&nbsp;windows were usually formed of large marble slabs with trefoilshaped heads or cusped arches. As a rule the upper storeys&nbsp;projected slightly over the lower wall, and were supported on&nbsp;small ornamental machicolations. The top storey frequently&nbsp;had an open loggia, with rows of pointed arches. When vaulting&nbsp;was used it also was of the pointed form, usually in simple&nbsp;quadripartite bays, with slightly moulded groin-ribs. The&nbsp;finest existing specimen of this style is the palace built about&nbsp;1300 by Boniface VIII. (Benedetto Gaetani), enclosing the&nbsp;tomb of Cecilia Metella on the Via Appia, with a graceful little&nbsp;chapel within the precincts of the castle. This building is well&nbsp;worthy of study; the remaining part is well preserved. Many&nbsp;houses of this period, though generally much injured by alterations, still exist in Rome. They are mostly in out-of-the-way&nbsp;alleys, and, mot being mentioned in any books, are seldom&nbsp;examined. The Ghetto (now destroyed) and the quarter near&nbsp;the Ponte Rotto contained many of these interesting buildings,&nbsp;as well as some of the most crowded parts of the Trastevere&nbsp;district, but most have disappeared owing to the wholesale&nbsp;destruction of old streets. Among those which may possibly&nbsp;escape for a while is the 13th-century house where Giulio Romano&nbsp;lived, near the Palazzo di Venezia, and the Albergo del Orso,&nbsp;at the end of the Via di Tordinona, of the same period, which&nbsp;was an inn in the 16th century and is one still; this has remains&nbsp;of a fine upper loggia, with rich cornices in moulded terra-cotta;&nbsp;the lowest storey has pointed vaulting resting on many pillars.&nbsp;Another graceful but less stately house exists, though sadly&nbsp;mutilated, opposite the entrance to the atrium of S. Cecilia in&nbsp;Trastevere.<sup>@@4</sup> Few now remain of the once numerous lofty&nbsp;towers built by the turbulent Roman barons for purposes of&nbsp;defence. The finest, the Torre delle Milizie on the Viminal,&nbsp;was built in the 13th century by the sons of Petrus Alexius;&nbsp;of about the same date is the Torre dei Conti, near the forum&nbsp;of Augustus, built by Marchione of Arezzo; both these were&nbsp;once much higher than they are now; they are very simple and&nbsp;noble in design, with massive walls faced with neat brickwork.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Till the 14th century the Lateran was the usual residence of the pope; this was once a very extensive building, covering&nbsp;four times its present area. The original house is said&nbsp;to have belonged to the senator Plautius Lateranus in&nbsp;the reign of Nero; but the existing part on the line&nbsp;of the Aurelian wall is of the 3rd century. This house, which&nbsp;had become the property of the emperors, was given by Constantine as a residence for S. Sylvester; it was very much&nbsp;enlarged at many periods during the next ten centuries; in 1308&nbsp;a great part was burnt, and in 1586 the ancient palace was&nbsp;completely destroyed by Sixtus V., and the present palace built&nbsp;by Domenico Fontana. The Cappella Sancta Sanctorum (see&nbsp;list of Cosmati works) is the only relic of the older palace.<sup>@@5</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3 </sup>For many centuries .wall-facing of small tufa stones was used, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> in the medieval part&quot; of the Capitol ; this was called <sup>u</sup> opera&nbsp;saracinesca ” from its supposed adoption from the Saracens; it&nbsp;is largely employed in the walls and towers of the Leonine city,&nbsp;built by Leo IV.

The greater part,of&nbsp;this wall is now destroyed and built over, but a long piece with&nbsp;massive circular towers well preserved exists in the gardens of the&nbsp;Vatican.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@4 </sup>The house of Crçscentius, popularly called the “ house of Rienzi/* near the Ponte Rotto, is perhaps the sole relic of the domestic&nbsp;architecture of an earlier period—the 12th century.
