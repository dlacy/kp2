To a gentleman qualified as was the Chevalier de Buat, ſuch a collection would be ineſ-timable, and might ſuggeſt a theory as far ſuperior to his as he has gone before all other writers.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">We ſhall conclude this article with ſome obſervations on the methods which may be taken for rendering ſmall </hi><hi rend="sup">ς</hi>  rivers and brooks fit for inland navigation, or at leaſt for floatage. We get much inſtruction on this ſubject from what has been ſaid concerning the ſwell produced in a river by weirs, bars, or any diminution of its former ſection. Our knowledge of the form which the ſurface of this ſwell affects, will furniſh rules for ſpacing theſe obſtructions in ſuch a manner, and at ſuch diſtances from each other, that the ſwell produced by one ſhall extend to the one above it.</p><p>If we know the ſlope, the breadth, and the depth of a river, in the droughts of ſummer, and have determined on the height of the flood-gates, or keeps, which are to be ſet up in its bed, it is evident that their ſtations are not matters of arbitrary choice, if we would derive the greateſt poſſible advantage from them.</p><p>Some rivers in Flanders and Italy are made navigable in ſome ſort by ſimple ſluices, which, being ſhut, form magazines of water, which, being diſeharged by opening the gates, raiſes the inferior reach enough to permit the paſſage of the craft which are kept on it. After this momentary riſe the keeps are ſhut again, the water finks in the lower reach, and the lighters which were floated through the ſhallows are now obliged to draw into thoſe parts of the reach where they can lie afloat till the next ſupply of water from above enables them to proceed. This is a very rude and imperfect method, and unjuſtifiable at this day, when we know the effect of locks, or at leaſt of double gates. We do not mean to enter on the conſideration of theſe contrivances, and to give the methods of their conſtruction, in this place, but refer our readers to what has been already ſaid on this ſubject in the articles Canal, Lock, Navigation <hi rend="italic">(Inland),</hi>  and to what will be ſaid in the article <hi rend="italic">lVH<hi rend="sup">c</hi>r ER-Works.</hi>  At preſent we confine ourſelves to the Angle point of huſhanding the different falls in the bed of the river, in ſuch a manner that there may be everywhere a ſufficient depth of water : and, in what we have to deliver on the ſubject, we ſhall take the form of an example to illuſtrate the application of the foregoing rules.</p><p>Suppoſe then a river 40 feet wide and 3 feet deep in the droughts of ſummer, with a ſlope of 1 in 4800. T his, by the formula of uniform motion, will have a velocity V — 23⅜ inches per ſecond, and its diſeharge will be 405216 cubic inches, or 234⅛ feet. It is propoſed to give this river a depth not leſs than five feet in any place, by means of flood-gates of fix feet high and x8 feet wide.</p><p>We firſt compute the height at which this body of 2344 cubic feet of water will diſcharge itſelf over the flood-gates. This we ſhall find by Prob. II. to be 30i inches, to which adding 72, the height of the gate, we have IO2⅛ for the whole height of the water above the floor of the gate ; the primitive depth of the river being 3 feet, the riſe or ſwell 5 feet 6)- inches. In the next place, we find the range or ſenſible extent of this ſwell by Prob. I. and the obſervations which accompany it. This will be found tobe nearly 9177 fathoms. Now ſince the primitive depth of the river is three feet, there is only wanted two ſeet of addition ; and the queſtion is reduced to the finding what point of the curved ſurface of the ſwell is two feet above the tangent plane at the head of the ſwell ? or how far this point is from the gate ? The whole extent being 9177 fathoms, and the deviations from the tangent plane being nearly in the duplicate ratio of the diſtances from the point of contact, we may inſtitute this proportion 66⅜ : 24 = 9177<hi rend="sup">,</hi> : 5526<hi rend="sup">2</hi>. The laſt term is the diſtance (from the head of the ſwell) of that part of the ſurface which is two feet above the primitive ſurface of the river. Therefore 9177—5526, or 3651 fathoms, is the diſtance of this part from the flood-gate ; and this is the diſtance at which the gates ſhould be placed, from each other. No inconvenience would ariſe from having them nearer, if the banks be high enough to contain the waters ; but if they are farther diltant, the required depth of water cannot be had without increaſing the height of the gates ; but if reaſons of conve-niency ſhould induce us to place them nearer, the ſame depth may be ſecured by lower gates, and no additional height will be required for the banks. This is generally a matter of moment, becauſe the raifing the water brings along with it the chance of flooding the adjoining fields. Knowing the place where the ſwell ceaſes to be ſenſible, we can keep the top of the intermediate flood-gate at the precife height of the curved ſurface of the ſwell by means of the proportionality of the deviations from the tangent to the diſtances from the point of contact.</p><p>But this rule will not do for a gate which is at a greater diſtance from the one above it than the 3651 fathoms already mentioned. We know that a higher gate is required, producing a more extenſive ſwell ; and the one ſwell does not coincide with the other, although they may both begin from the ſame point A (ſig. 21.( Nor will the curves even be ſimilar, unleſs the thickneſs of the ſheet of water flowing over the gate be increaſed in the ſame ratio. But this is not the caſe ; becauſe the produce of the river, and therefore the thickneſs of the ſheet of water, is conſtant.</p><p>But we may ſuppoſe them ſimilar without erring more than two or three decimals of an inch ; and then we ſhall have AF : AL =y^F : DL ; from which, if we take the thickneſs of the ſheet of water already calculated for the other gates, there will remain the height of the gate BL.</p><p>By following theſe methods, inſtead of proceeding by random gueſſes, we ſhall procure the greateſt depth of water at the ſmalleſt expence poſſible.</p><p>But there is a circumſtance which muſt be attended to, and which, if neglected, may in a ſhort time render all our works uſeleſs. Theſe gates muſt frequently be open in the time of freſhes ; and as this channel then has its natural Hope increaſed in every reach by the great contraction of the ſection in the gates, and alſo rolls along a greater body of water, the action of the ſtream on its bed muſt be increaſed by the augmentation of velocity which theſe circumſtances will produce:</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
