The young men of Walachia had&nbsp;come into contact with Western literature, which they were anxious&nbsp;to transplant to their own country. Some had been sent to Paris&nbsp;for their education, such as Poteca, Marcovici, the Voinescus, Moroiu&nbsp;and others, who developed an almost feverish activity in translation.&nbsp;Most of the writings of Florian, Marmontel, Lc Sage, Montesquieu&nbsp;and others were rapidly translated into Rumanian. The picaresque&nbsp;novel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lazarillo de Tonnes</span><span class="font0"> also found its translator, ana appeared&nbsp;in 1839, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paul and Virginia</span><span class="font0"> in 1831. Campe’s German </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Robinson&nbsp;Crusoe</span><span class="font0"> (1816) and his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Discovery of America</span><span class="font0"> were translated by&nbsp;Draghici (1835). G. Asaki and Alexander. Beldiman in Moldavia&nbsp;developed a similar activity. Beldiman copied a number of ancient&nbsp;chronicles, wrote a satire on the Greeks, and translated and adapted&nbsp;a number of French tragedies and dramas, in verse and prose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nowhere has the theatre played a more important rôle in the history of civilization than in Walachia and Moldavia, more in the&nbsp;former than in the latter. It formed the rallying-ground for&nbsp;the new generation which chafed under the tyranny of a&nbsp;Greek court. A certain Aristia, of Greek origin, but soon&nbsp;acclimatized to his surroundings as teacher at the high school in&nbsp;Bucharest, was the first to adapt foreign dramas for the Rumanian&nbsp;stage. These were first performed in Greek and afterwards translated into Rumanian. The plays produced on the Rumanian&nbsp;stage included most of the dramas of Molière, some of Corneille,&nbsp;Kotzebue and Metastasio, whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Achille in Schiro was</span><span class="font0"> the first&nbsp;drama translated into Rumanian (by Iordache Slàtîneau, printed&nbsp;at Sibiu in 1797). Schiller was also translated, and a few plays&nbsp;of Shakespeare </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Hamlet,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c.) from a French version. Victor&nbsp;Hugo’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Angelo</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Maria Tudor</span><span class="font0"> were translated by Constantin&nbsp;Negrutin. Those who kept in touch with the old literature—men&nbsp;sucn as Beldiman, Marcovici and Ncgni^in—were able even in&nbsp;their metrical translations to do justice to the originals and at the&nbsp;same time not to distort the character of the Rumanian language.&nbsp;Among such translators was Skavinschi, who came originally from&nbsp;Transylvania to Jassy, and translated Regnald’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Democrit</span><span class="font0"> into verse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lyrical and epic poetry of the time follows somewhat the same lines, but with certain notable differences. The individuality&nbsp;of the authors is more marked, and they advance much&nbsp;sooner from translations to independent poetry. Transylvania, which awoke to a new life towards the end of the 18th&nbsp;century, produced some of the most popular poets. Among them&nbsp;were Vasile Aaron ¿1770-1822) and Ion Barak (1770-1848). Aaron&nbsp;wrote the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Passion,</span><span class="font0"> in 10,000 verses (1802; often reprintçd);&nbsp;the lyrical romances of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Piram $i Tisbe</span><span class="font0"> (1808) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sofronim $i&nbsp;H&amp;riti</span><span class="font0"> (1821); and the humorous </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Leonat $i Dorofata,</span><span class="font0"> a satire&nbsp;on bad women and on drunken husbands, now a chapbook. Barak&nbsp;wrote </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Râsipirea Ierusalimului</span><span class="font0"> (1821), “The Destruction of Jerusalem,” almost as long as Aaron’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Passion</span><span class="font0"> ; and he versified a Magyar&nbsp;folktale, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arghir si Elena,</span><span class="font0"> which has also become a chapbook, and has&nbsp;been interpreted as a political poem with a hidden meaning. He&nbsp;also translated the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Arabian Nights</span><span class="font0"> from the German. In Walachia&nbsp;a certain Ion Budai Deleanu, a man of great learning, author of a&nbsp;hitherto unpublished Rumanian dictionary of great value, wrote&nbsp;a satirical epos in which gipsies play the chief part. It is called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jiganiafa</span><span class="font0"> (1812) and consists of 12 songs and of many thousand&nbsp;verses. The author displays a profound knowledge of the life&nbsp;and the customs of the gipsies, and of Western literature from the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Batrachomyomachia</span><span class="font0"> to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">.PuceUe</span><span class="font0"> of Voltaire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The love-songs of the time are primitive imitations of the Neo-Greek lyric dithyrambs and rhapsodies, which through the teaching of the princes of Walachia were considered as the fountainhead of&nbsp;poetical inspiration. But a closer acquaintance with the West&nbsp;led to greater independence in poetical composition. In the three&nbsp;generations of the \ icarescu one can follow this process of rapid&nbsp;evolution. lanachc Vacarescu, author of the first native Rumanian&nbsp;grammar on independent lines, was also the first who tried his hand&nbsp;at poetry, following Greek examples. He then studied Italian,&nbsp;French and German poetry, and made translations from Voltaire&nbsp;and Goethe. His son Alecu (b. 1795) followed his example. Both&nbsp;were overshadowed by the grandson loan (b, 1818), who was more&nbsp;than any other man both the representative of an epoch fast vanishing and the harbinger of the new spirit that was stirring young&nbsp;Rumania. The collected poems of 1. Vacarescu were published in&nbsp;1848; but among them were some of the poems of Ianache and&nbsp;Alecu, which were confused with his own work. In this volume,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Colecfe din poeziile domnului mare logofet I, Vacarescu,</span><span class="font0"> there are&nbsp;odes, hymns, patriotic poems, ballads, lyrical and didactic poems,&nbsp;some of them among the most beautiful in the language. A contemporary of his earlier period, Paris Mumuleanu (1794-1837),&nbsp;wrote his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rost de poezie</span><span class="font0"> (1820) under Greek influence, but afterwards passed under the spell of Maior and Tzikindea, whose Latin&nbsp;propaganda he was one of the first to advocate in Rumania. In&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Caractère</span><span class="font0"> (Bucharest, 1828) Latin forms are common. One more&nbsp;poet, and a real one, is Vasile Càrlova (1809-1831), whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ruins of&nbsp;Tirgovishtec</span><span class="font0"> sufficed to place him among the foremost Rumanian&nbsp;poets of the 19th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Moldavia a similar development took place, translations leading up to independent production. . The most prominent figure is that&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ot</span><span class="font0"> the scholar and linguist Constantin Konaki (1777-1849), who&nbsp;might be termed the Rumanian Longfellow for the facility and&nbsp;felicity of his translations from Western poetry and for his short&nbsp;poems, easily set to music and very popular. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alcâtuiri fi&nbsp;tâlmâciri</span><span class="font0"> appeared in 1858. Constantin Negrutin, who was at&nbsp;first influenced by the Russian poets, notably Pushkin, successfully&nbsp;translated poems of Victor Hugo, and rivalled Konaki in his dexterity and fidelity to the original.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Third Period: 1830-</span><span class="font1"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.—The agitation for the trans</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">literation of the alphabet, the elimination of all non-Latin words from the language and the ostracism of the old literature,&nbsp;completely crippled all literary activity, first in Transylvania&nbsp;and then in Rumania. The Latin movement was first brought&nbsp;into Walachia by a certain .George Lazar from across the mountains. Lazar was appointed teacher at the St Sava school&nbsp;of Bucharest, where he spread the new doctrine of the Latin&nbsp;origin of the Rumanians; Latinizing tendencies were, however,&nbsp;not yet imported into the language. Of his pupils there was&nbsp;one whose influence became decisive: Ion Eliade (Heliade),&nbsp;afterwards also known as I. E. Radulescu (1802-1872),&nbsp;a man of immense activity, of great power of initiative&nbsp;and of still greater imagination. He it was who ushered in&nbsp;the new epoch, and for close upon forty years he stood at the&nbsp;head of almost every literary undertaking.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There were two periods in his life—the latter the exact opposite and negation of the former. Up to 1848 he was closely connected&nbsp;with politics, the theatre and the school—he was the successor&nbsp;to Lazar; he wrote grammars, and the introductions to his grammars&nbsp;are models of lucidity, combined with a wide historical view. He&nbsp;was the founder of the first political and literary review, and he had&nbsp;a genius for discovering talent, and the merit of assisting it. Through&nbsp;his. reviews he trained the middle-class to read and to take an&nbsp;active interest in literary problems. Through his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Curier de ambe sexe&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1837-41) he disseminated translations from political and other&nbsp;works, thus paving the way for the political change of 1848. About&nbsp;this time he turned to philology, and fell under the spell of the&nbsp;Transylvanian school. Slowly he developed his theories about&nbsp;language and writing, and he ended as a fanatic wedded to extraordinary views. He was a prolific writer and translator of dramas&nbsp;and novels from French and Italian, the latter appearing mostly&nbsp;in his periodical. The number of his publications is legion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All the prominent Rumanians of that period were politicians; they strove to obtain the emancipation of tne country from Turkish&nbsp;dominion, and, later on, the union of Walachia and Moldavia. Everything was placed at the service of this national&nbsp;aspiration, which is the keynote of the poems of Bolinti-neanu (1826-1873). He also was discovered by Radulescu, who&nbsp;published his first and best known poem, “ The Dying Virgin.” In&nbsp;1848 he was exiled, together with the other leaders of the revolution,&nbsp;and he spent the next nine years in travels in the East. There he&nbsp;gathered the materials for his lyrical poems “ Macedonele ” and&nbsp;“ Florile Bosforului ? ” Returning in 1857 to Walachia, he occupied&nbsp;high administrative posts, and he wrote a number of historical&nbsp;novels </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Traian, Mircea, §tefan,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c.), dramas </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Lâpuçneanu, Miknea,&nbsp;Mihaiu,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c.), longer poems </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">\Sorin, Conrad),</span><span class="font0"> and his politico-philosophical novel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Elena,</span><span class="font0"> These mostly patriotic compositions were as&nbsp;a rule less felicitous than his political satires </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{Nemesis, Menade,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c.).&nbsp;His peculiar strength lay in the historical ballad, which he was the&nbsp;first to introduce into Rumanian poetry, and in the vivid portraiture&nbsp;of Oriental scenery and emotions. He died in a lunatic asylum&nbsp;forgotten by all, and even his writings have, save in one early edition,&nbsp;not been published without unwarranted alterations by the editor&nbsp;Sion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A contemporary of Bolintineanu was Grigorie Alexandrescu (1812-1885), also a pupil of Eliade. Imperfect in his rhyme aud&nbsp;rhythm, his poetry is of a didactical nature, and.his best&nbsp;poems are rhymed fables, many of which are thinly disguised political satires. He also translated the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alzire&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1834) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mêrope</span><span class="font0"> (1847) of Voltaire. Among his contemporaries&nbsp;may be mentioned G. Crejeanu (1829-1887) and A. Sihlcanu (1834-1857), who left some weak poems of a sentimental and patriotic character. A Depara^ianu (1835-1865), whose language show's traces of&nbsp;the new Latinizing school ; and Nicolae Nicoleanu (1833-1871 ), w’hose&nbsp;powerful poems, full of deep and often mystical reflections, lead on&nbsp;from Alexandrescu to Eminescu, all three being the poets of pessimism. In Teodor Çerbânescu (b. 1839) we find the reflex of Bolintineanu&nbsp;of the earlier period, in the beauty and simplicity of his lyrical&nbsp;poems—not yet published in complete form. Like Çerbànescu, Vasile&nbsp;Alecsandri (1821-1890), the greatest of Rumanian lyrical poets (see&nbsp;Alecsandri), was a Moldavian. In France, under the influence&nbsp;of Béranger and the romantic school, he was led to turn to popular</span></p>
