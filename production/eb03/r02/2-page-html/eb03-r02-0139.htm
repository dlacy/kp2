<p><span class="font0">ſeat of the empire. The people were inclined to favour the project, Veii offering them a place fortified by art&nbsp;and nature, good houſes ready built, a wholeſome air,&nbsp;and a fruitful territory. On the other hand, they had&nbsp;no materials for rebuilding a whole city, were quite&nbsp;exhauſted by misfortunes, and even their ſlrength was&nbsp;greatly diminiſhed. This gave them a reluctance to ſo&nbsp;great an undertaking, and emboldened the tribunes to&nbsp;utter ſeditious harangues againſt Camillus, as a man&nbsp;too ambitious of being the reſtorer of Rome. They&nbsp;even inſinuated that the name of Romulus, which had&nbsp;been given him, threatened the republic with a new&nbsp;king. But the ſenate took the part of Camillus, and,&nbsp;being deſirous to ſee Rome rebuilt, continued him,&nbsp;contrary to cuſtom, a full year in the office of dictator;&nbsp;during which time he made it his whole buſineſs to ſup-preſs the ſtrong inclination of the people to remove&nbsp;to Veii. Having aſſembled the curiæ, he expoſtulated&nbsp;with them upon the matter; and, by arguments drawn&nbsp;from prudence, religion, and glory, prevailed upon them&nbsp;to lay aſide ail thoughts of leaving Rome. As it was&nbsp;neceſſary to have the reſolution of the people confirmed&nbsp;by the ſenate, the dictator reported it to the conſcript&nbsp;fathers, leaving every one at full liberty to vote as he&nbsp;pleaſed. While L. Lucretius, who was to give his&nbsp;opinion the firſt, was beginning to ſpeak, it happened&nbsp;that a centurion, who with his company had been upon&nbsp;guard, and was then marching by the ſenate-houſe,&nbsp;cried out aloud, “ Plant your colours, enſign; this is&nbsp;the beſt place to, ſtay in. ” Theſe words were conſider-ed as dictated by the gods themſelves; and Lucretius,&nbsp;taking occaſion from them to urge the neceſſity of&nbsp;ſtaying at Rome, “ An happy omen, (cried he); I&nbsp;adore the gods who gave it. ” The whole ſenate applauded, his words; and a decree was paſſed without&nbsp;oppoſition for rebuilding the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though the tribunes of the people were defeated by Camillus in this point, they reſolved to exerciſe their&nbsp;authority againſt another patrician, who had indeed deſerved puniſhment. This was Q. Fabius, who had violated the law of nations, and thereby provoked the&nbsp;Gauls, and occaſioned the burning of Rome- His&nbsp;crime being notorious, he was ſummoned by C. Martius Rutilus before the aſſembly of the people, to anſwer for his conduct in his embaſſy. The criminal had&nbsp;reaſon to fear the ſevereſt puniſhment: but his relations&nbsp;gave out that he died, ſuddenly; which generally happened when the accuſed perſon had courage enough to&nbsp;prevent his condemnation, and the ſhame of a public&nbsp;puniſhment. On the other hand, the republic gave&nbsp;an houſe ſituated on the Capitol to M. Manlius, as a&nbsp;monument of his valour, and of the gratitude of his&nbsp;follow-citizens. Camillus cloſed this year by laying&nbsp;down his dictatorſhip: whereupon an interregnum enſued, during which he governed the ſtate alternately&nbsp;with P. Cornelius Scipio and it fell to his lot to preſide&nbsp;at the election of new magiſtrates, when L. Valerius&nbsp;Poplicola, L. Virginius Tricoſtus, P. Cornelius Coſſus,&nbsp;A. Manlius Capitolinus, L. Æmilius Mamercinus, and&nbsp;L. Poſthumius Albinus, were choſen. The firſt care&nbsp;of theſe new magiſtrates was to collect all the ancient&nbsp;monuments of the religion and civil laws of Rome which could be found among the ruins of the demoliſhed city. The laws of the twelve tables, and ſome of&nbsp;the laws of the kings, had been written on braſs, and</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">fixed up in the forum and the treaties made with ſeveral nations had been engraved on pillars erected in the temples. Pains were therefore taken to gather up&nbsp;the ruins of theſe precious monuments; and what could&nbsp;not be found was ſupplied by memory. The ponti-hees, on their part, took care to re-eſtabliſh the religious ceremonies, and made alſo a liſt of lucky and unlucky days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And now the governors of the republic applied themſelves wholly to rebuild the city; Plutarch tells us, that as the workmen were digging among the ruins of the temple of Mars, they found Romulus’s augural ſtaff&nbsp;untouched by the flames; and that this was looked&nbsp;upon as a prodigy, from whence the Romans inferred&nbsp;that their city would continue for ever. The expence&nbsp;of building private houles was partly defrayed out of&nbsp;the public treaſure. The ædiles had the direction of the&nbsp;works; but they had ſo little taſte for order or beauty,&nbsp;that the city, when rebuilt, was even leſs regular than in&nbsp;the time of Romulus. And though in Auguſtus’s time,&nbsp;when Rome became the capital of the known world,&nbsp;the temples, palaces, and private houſes, were built in&nbsp;a, more magnificent manner than before; yet even then&nbsp;theſe new decorations did not rectify the faults of the&nbsp;plan upon, which the city had been built after its firſt&nbsp;demolition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rome was ſcarce reſtored, when her citizens were alarmed by the news that all her neighbours were combining to her deſtruction. The Æqui, the Volſci, the&nbsp;Hetrurians, and even her old friends the Latins and&nbsp;the Hernici, entered into an alliance againſt her, in&nbsp;hopes of opprefling her before, ſhe had recovered her&nbsp;ſtrength. The republic, under this terror, nominated&nbsp;Camillus dictator a third time. This great commander,&nbsp;having appointed Servilius to be his general of horſe,&nbsp;ſummoned the citizens to take arms, without excepting,&nbsp;even the old men. He divided the new levies into&nbsp;three bodies. The firſt, under the command of A-Manlius, he ordered to encamp under the walls of&nbsp;Rome; the ſecond he ſent into the neighbourhood of&nbsp;Veii; and marched himſelf at the head of the third,&nbsp;to relieve the tribunes, who were cloſely beſieged in&nbsp;their camp by the united forces of the Volſci and Latins. Finding the enemy encamped near Lanuvium,&nbsp;on the declivity of the hill Marcius, he poſted himſelf&nbsp;behind it, and, by lighting, fires, gave the diſtreſſed&nbsp;Romans notice of his arrival. The Volſci and Latins, when they underſtood that Camillus was at the head of&nbsp;an army newly arrived, were ſo terrified, that they&nbsp;ſhut themſelves up in their camp, which they fortified&nbsp;with great trees cut down in haſte. The dictator, obſerving that this barrier was of green wood, and that&nbsp;every morning there aroſe a great wind, which blew&nbsp;full upon the enemy’s camp, formed the deſign of taking it by fire. With this view he ordered one part&nbsp;of his army to go by break of day with fire-brands to&nbsp;the windward ſide of the camp, and the other to make&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">briſk attack on the oppoſite ſide. By this means the&nbsp;enemy were entirely defeated, and their camp taken.&nbsp;Camillus then commanded his men to extinguiſh the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">flames, in order to ſave the booty, with which he rewarded his army. He then left his ſon in the camp, to guard the priſoners; and, entering the country of&nbsp;the Æqui, made himſelf maſter of their capital city&nbsp;Bola. From thence he marched againſt the Volſci;</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
