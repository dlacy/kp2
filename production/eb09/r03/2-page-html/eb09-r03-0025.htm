<p><span class="font1">stitution conferring citizenship on all his free subjects that provincials generally acquired </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tcstamenti factio</span><span class="font1"> ; and by that time a testament bearing externally the requisite number of seals had been&nbsp;recognized as sufficient for a grant of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio,</span><span class="font1"> unchallengeable by the heirs-at-law, even though they were able to prove that&nbsp;neither </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">familiae mancipatio</span><span class="font1"> nor </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tcstamenti nuncupatio</span><span class="font1"> had intervened. Hence the universal adoption of what Justinian calls the&nbsp;preetorian testament, which, however, underwent considerable reform at the hands of the emperors, notably in the requirement (in&nbsp;the ordinary case) of signature by the testator and subscription by&nbsp;the witnesses. There was much hesitating legislation on the subject&nbsp;before the law was finally established as it stands in the Justinianian&nbsp;books ; and even at the last we find it encumbered with many exceptions and reservations in favour of testaments that were merely&nbsp;deeds of division by a parent among his children, testaments made&nbsp;in time of plague, testaments recorded in books of court, testaments&nbsp;entrusted to the safe-keeping of the emperor, and so forth. Codicils&nbsp;had become deeds of such importance as, in the absence of a testament, to be dealt with as imposing a trust on the heir-at-law ; it&nbsp;was therefore thought expedient to deny effect to them unless&nbsp;attested by at least five witnesses. And a most important step in&nbsp;advance was taken by Justinian in the recognition of the validity&nbsp;of an oral </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa</span><span class="font1"> trust; for he declared that, if it should be&nbsp;represented to a competent judge that a person on his deathbed had&nbsp;by word of mouth directed his heir-at-law to give something to the&nbsp;complainant, the heir should be required either on his oath to deny&nbsp;the averment or to give or pay what was claimed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the matter of intestacy there was long a halting between two opinions,—a desire still further to amend the law in the direction&nbsp;taken by the prsetors and by the legislature in the Tertullian and&nbsp;Orphitian senatusconsults, and yet a hesitancy about breaking&nbsp;altogether from the time-hallowed principle of agnation. Justinian&nbsp;in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code</span><span class="font1"> went far beyond his predecessors, making a mother’s&nbsp;right of succession independent altogether of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jus liberorum ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">extending that of a daughter or sister to her descendants, without&nbsp;any deduction in favour of agnates thus excluded; admitting&nbsp;emancipated collaterals and their descendants as freely as if there&nbsp;had been no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio minima</span><span class="font1"> ; applying to agnates the&nbsp;same </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">successio graduum</span><span class="font1"> that the prsetors had allowed to cognates,&nbsp;and so forth. But it was by his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Novels,</span><span class="font1"> especially the 118th and&nbsp;127th, that he revolutionized the system, by eradicating agnation&nbsp;altogether and settling the canons of descent—which were the&nbsp;same for real and personal estate—solely on the basis of blood kinship, whether through males or females, and whether crossed or&nbsp;not by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio.</span><span class="font1"> First came descendants of the intestate,&nbsp;male and female alike, taking </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per capita</span><span class="font1"> if all were of the same&nbsp;degree, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per stirpes</span><span class="font1"> if of different degrees. Failing descendants, the&nbsp;succession passed to the nearest ascendants, and, concurrently with&nbsp;them, to brothers and sisters of full blood and (by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nov.</span><span class="font1"> 127) the&nbsp;children of any that had predeceased. Where there were ascendants alone, one-half of the succession went to the paternal line&nbsp;and one-half to the maternal; where there were ascendants and&nbsp;brothers and sisters, or only brothers and sisters, the division&nbsp;was made equally </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per capita</span><span class="font1"> ; when children of a deceased brother&nbsp;or sister participated it was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per stirpes.</span><span class="font1"> In the third class came&nbsp;brothers and sisters of half-blood or by adoption and their children ;&nbsp;the division here was on the same principle as in the second class.&nbsp;The fourth class included all other collaterals according to propinquity, and without distinction between full and half blood ;&nbsp;the primary division was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per stirpes,</span><span class="font1"> but all of the same degree&nbsp;took </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">per capita.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A reform effected by Justinian by his 115th </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Novel</span><span class="font1"> ought not to pass unnoticed ; for it rendered superfluous all the old rules about&nbsp;disherison and praeterition of a testator’s children, practically&nbsp;abolished </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio contra tabulas,</span><span class="font1"> and established the&nbsp;principle that a child had, as a general rule, an inherent and indefeasible right to be one of his father’s heirs in a certain share at all&nbsp;events of his succession, and that a parent had the same right in&nbsp;the succession of his child if the latter had died without issue.&nbsp;The enactment enumerated certain grounds upon which alone it&nbsp;should be lawful for a parent to disinherit his child or a child his&nbsp;parent, declaring that in eveiy case of disherison the reason of it&nbsp;should be stated in the testament, but giving leave to the person&nbsp;disinherited to dispute and disprove the facts when the testament&nbsp;was opened. If a child who had not been disinherited—and one&nbsp;improperly disinherited was eventually in the same position—was&nbsp;not instituted to at least his “ legitim” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{legitima</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">debita portio),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">he was entitled to have the testament declared null in so far as the&nbsp;institutions in it were concerned, thus opening the succession to&nbsp;himself and the other heirs-at-law, but without affecting the minor&nbsp;provisions, such as bequests, nominations of tutors, &amp;c. The&nbsp;legitim, which under the practice of the centumviral court had&nbsp;been one-fourth of the share to which the child would have been&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab intestato,</span><span class="font1"> was raised by Justinian to one-third at least,&nbsp;and one-half where there were five or more entitled to participate.&nbsp;He did not allow challenge of the will to be excluded, as in the&nbsp;earlier </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">querela inofficiosi tcstamenti,</span><span class="font1"> because the testator had made&nbsp;advances to his child during his life or left him a legacy which&nbsp;quantitatively equalled the legitim ; his idea was that a child was&nbsp;entitled to recognition by his parent </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">as one of his heirs,</span><span class="font1"> and that&nbsp;to deny him that position was to put upon him an indignity which&nbsp;the law would not permit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Amongst the other beneficial changes effected by Justinian may be mentioned the assimilation so far as possible of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hcreditas</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bonorum possessio,</span><span class="font1"> so that the latter might be taken like the former&nbsp;without formal petition for a grant of it; the equiparation of&nbsp;legacies and singular trust-gifts, and the application of some of&nbsp;their rules to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mortis causa</span><span class="font1"> donations ; the extension of the rule of&nbsp;“transmission” to every heir without exception, so that, if he&nbsp;died within the time allowed him for considering whether or not&nbsp;he would accept </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{tempos deliberandi),</span><span class="font1"> his power of acceptance or&nbsp;declinature passed to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font1"> heirs, to be exercised by them within&nbsp;what remained of the period ; the introduction of entry under&nbsp;inventory </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{cum beneficio inventarii),</span><span class="font1"> which limited the heir’s responsibilities and rendered unnecessary the nine or twelve months&nbsp;of deliberation ; and the application of the principle of collation&nbsp;to descendants generally, so that they were bound to throw into&nbsp;the mass of the succession before its partition every advance they&nbsp;had received from their parent in anticipation of their shares.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">IV. The Justinianian Law-Books.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Their Use in the Courts and in the Schools.—</span><span class="font1">Although the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes</span><span class="font1"> were primarily intended to serve as a text-book in the schools, it was expressly declared that they and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digest</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">should be regarded as just so many parts of one great piece of&nbsp;legislation and all of equal authority, and that, although </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Digest&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code</span><span class="font1"> were but collections of legislation and doctrine that had&nbsp;proceeded originally from many different hands, yet they were to&nbsp;be treated with the same respect as if they had been the work of&nbsp;Justinian himself. But, while everything within them was to be&nbsp;held as law, nothing outside them was to be looked at, not even&nbsp;the volumes from which they had been collected ; and so far did&nbsp;this go that, after the publication of the revised </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Code,</span><span class="font1"> neither the&nbsp;first edition of it nor the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fifty Decisions</span><span class="font1"> were allowed to be referred&nbsp;to. If a case arose for which no precedent was to be found, the&nbsp;emperor was to be resorted to for its decision, as being outside his&nbsp;collections the only fountain of the law. To preserve the purity&nbsp;of the texts Justinian forbade the use of conventional abbreviations&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{sigla)</span><span class="font1"> in making transcripts, visiting an offender with the penalties&nbsp;of falsification </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{crimen falsi).</span><span class="font1"> Literal translations into Greek were&nbsp;authorized, and indeed were very necessary for many of his subjects;&nbsp;so were 7rapaTtrXa or summaries of the contents of individual titles&nbsp;(although the jurists read the word less strictly). Commentaries&nbsp;and general summaries were forbidden under heavy penalties, as&nbsp;an interference with the imperial prerogative of interpretation; but&nbsp;the prohibition does not seem to have been enforced, as we have&nbsp;accounts and remains not only of translations but of commentaries, notes, abridgments, excerpts, and general summaries even&nbsp;in Justinian’s lifetime. These, it is true, were mostly by professors&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{antecessores),</span><span class="font1"> and their productions may have been intended primarily for educational purposes ; but there can be little doubt that&nbsp;they soon passed into the hands of the practitioners and were used&nbsp;without scruple in the courts. A Greek </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Paraphrase of the Institutes,</span><span class="font1"> usually attributed to Theophilus, a professor in Constantinople&nbsp;and one of Justinian’s commissioners, is commonly supposed to have&nbsp;been used by him in his prelections. It embodies much more historical matter than is to be found in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes</span><span class="font1">; but its value&nbsp;has been very differently rated by different critics. Its latest editor,&nbsp;Ferrini, who puts a high estimate on it, is of opinion that the&nbsp;original of it was a paraphrase of Gaius, which was remodelled&nbsp;after the plan of Justinian’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutes,</span><span class="font1"> and had their new matter&nbsp;incorporated in order to adapt it to the altered conditions ; but he&nbsp;doubts if there be any sufficient authority for ascribing it to Theophilus. If he be right in assuming that it was really a redaction of&nbsp;Gaius, the historical explanations will bejeceived with all the more&nbsp;confidence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fate of the Justinianian Books in the East.—</span><span class="font1">The literary work indicated in the preceding section was continued throughout the 6th&nbsp;century. But the next three were comparatively barren, the only&nbsp;thing worth noting being the ’EKÁ0777 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">tGiv</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> vbyuv év crvvT¿fj.ifi yevopévy&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of Leo the Isaurian in 740, professedly an abstract of the whole&nbsp;Justinianian law amended and rearranged ; but it was repealed&nbsp;by Basil the Macedonian on account of its imperfections and its&nbsp;audacious departure from the law it pretended to summarize. The&nbsp;last-named emperor, with his son Leo the Philosopher, set themselves in the end of the 9th and beginning ©f the 10th centuries to&nbsp;the production of an authoritative Greek version of the whole of&nbsp;the Justinianian collections and legislation, omitting what had become obsolete, excising redundancies, and introducing such of the&nbsp;post-Justinianian legislation as merited preservation. The result&nbsp;was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Basilica</span><span class="font1"> (Tá BcnrtXtKá, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e., vb/uapa),</span><span class="font1"> which was completed in&nbsp;the reign of Leo, though probably issued in a preparatory stage in&nbsp;the reign of Basil, who also published a sort of institutional work,&nbsp;the Ilpó^eípor, which was revised and republished by Leo under</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
