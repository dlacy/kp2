        <p><span class="font1">hypothesis, which requires to be associated with the corollary that
                British translations or adaptations were formed when the Roman influence began to
                wane, would account&nbsp;for the curious circumstance that some of the Greek
                and&nbsp;Oriental fictions are found in Anglo-Saxon versions of&nbsp;much greater
                antiquity than any that have survived in&nbsp;the other vernaculars of Europe.
                Direct transference of&nbsp;such works from classical codices can hardly be
                presumed&nbsp;to have been the custom of a rough and semi-barbarous&nbsp;nation of
                Teutonic invaders ; the medium must have been&nbsp;the existence of Brito-Latin and
                British poems among the&nbsp;conquered people.</span></p>

                modern&nbsp;fiction. Within a few years after Geoffrey’s publication&nbsp;the Norman

                archdeacon of Oxford in the year 1210, was&nbsp;a man of Welsh origin or kindred. In
                1185 Hue de Rote-lande of Credenhill near Hereford wrote a French
                romantic&nbsp;poem, in which the names of the characters are all derived&nbsp;from
                the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thebais</span><span
                class="font1"> of Statius, but the incidents are wholly&nbsp;imaginative or derived
                from other sources. In it he speaks,&nbsp;in deprecation of any blame for his
                falsification of the&nbsp;truth of history, of Walter Map as being quite as great
                a&nbsp;romancer as himself. In connexion with statements fre-quently repeated in the
                early MSS. of the romances, this&nbsp;remark suffices to prove that before 1185
                Walter Map had&nbsp;already published his </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Lancelot.</span><span class="font1"> We may fairly put
                the&nbsp;date before 1175, say about 1170 ; and it would be probably correct to
                assume that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Lancelot</span><span class="font1"> was a French&nbsp;poem (or prose work ?)
                composed while the author was still&nbsp;young (1165-70). It has perished, like Luc

                >Tristan,</span><span class="font1"> and we can only conjecture that it had
                some&nbsp;similar connexion with the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Achilles</span><span class="font1"> of Statius to that
                of&nbsp;Hue de Rotelande’s poem with the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Thebais.</span><span class="font1"> It was, however,
                reduced to or rewritten in prose and amplified before&nbsp;1200 in the form in which
                we now find it in several old&nbsp;MSS. (none earlier than the 13th century). It is
                certain&nbsp;that Rustighello or Rusticien of Pisa was employed about&nbsp;1270-75
                to unify or harmonize in a single compilation the&nbsp;scattered Arthurian romances,
                and it is considered probable&nbsp;that the result was the French prose original of
                the existing </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morte
                Arthur.</span><span class="font1"> But it is also certain that there
                exist&nbsp;prose Arthurian romances in MSS. at least as old as 1270,&nbsp;and that
                they were copies of yet older ones. Rusticien’s&nbsp;work must have been simply one
                of compression and combination. We know from the MSS. of two different
                prose&nbsp;translations of a totally different romantic chronicle
                (the&nbsp;Pseudo-Turpin’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Chronicle of Charlemagne),</span><span class="font1"> written in and&nbsp;about
                1200, that metrical narrative was losing credit and&nbsp;that French prose
                composition had already set in. This&nbsp;statement, which refers to the French
                kingdom, is likely&nbsp;to be yet more applicable to England, where metrical
                suc-cess would naturally be more difficult to achieve than in&nbsp;the true home of
                French speech. As prose was current in&nbsp;France before 1200, it is not rash to
                assume that it had&nbsp;an earlier and less limited currency in England. Reckon-ing
                thus we may assume that the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Lancelot</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Tristan&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">were written in

        <p><span class="font1">The Round Table and the Grail are so closely connected that it is
                difficult to regard them as having had each a&nbsp;separate origin. The mention of
                the former by Wace&nbsp;proves the existence of stories of a Round Table
                current&nbsp;before 1155. The Round Table as it appears in the current&nbsp;texts of
                the romances is simply an important portion of&nbsp;the furniture of the narratives
                : it does not represent a&nbsp;cycle of incidents or even a number of special
                episodes.&nbsp;One might suppose from the form of Wace’s phrase that&nbsp;the word
                was with him, as it is now, a general epithet to&nbsp;designate Arthurian stories,
                rather than merely the name&nbsp;of a material object, as it is in the romances. But
                we&nbsp;cannot assume the fact for lack of specific information.&nbsp;The first and
                also the chief instance which we have of the&nbsp;appearance of the· Round Table
                (beyond Wace’s allusion)&nbsp;is in the existing </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Lancelot,</span><span class="font1"> which we may refer
                to about&nbsp;1190. In the epilogue of the </span><span class="font1"

                “ les grans livres de la tauble roonde.” There is&nbsp;no reason to imagine that
                this phrase was written after&nbsp;the year 1200; and it indicates sufficiently that
                several&nbsp;books were collectively styled “ Romances of the Round&nbsp;Table ”
                between 1155 and the end of the century. One of&nbsp;these books was </span><span
