<p><label>RAPE</label>
in law, the carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and againſt her will. This, by the Jewiſh law, was pu ni ſhed with death, in caſe the damſel was betrothed to another man : and, in cafe ſhe was not betrothed, then a heavy fine of fifty ſhekels was to be paid to the damſel’s father, and ſhe was to be the wife of the raviſher all the days of his life ; without that power of divorce, which was in general permitted by the Moſaic law.</p><p>The civil law puniſhes the crime of raviſhment with death and confifcation of goods: under which it includes both the offence of forcible abduction, or taking away a woman from her friends ; and alſo the preſent offence of forcibly diſhonouring her ; either of which, without the other, is in that law ſufficient to conſtitute a capital crime. Alſo the ſtealing away a woman from her parents or guardians, and debauching her, is equaſly penal by the emperor’s edict, whether ſhe conſent or is forced. And this, in order to take away from women every opportunity of offending in this way; whom the Ro-man laws ſuppoſe never to go aſtray without the ſeduction and arts of the other ſex ; and therefore, by reſtraining and making ſo highly penal the ſolicitations of the men, they meant to fecure effectually the honour</p><p>of the women. But our Engliſh law does not enter* tain quite ſuch ſublime ideas of the honour of either ſex, as to lay the blame of a mutual fault upon one of the tranfgreffors only ; and therefore makes it a neceſk fary ingredient in the crime of rape, that it muſt be againſt the woman’s wiſl.</p><p>Rape was puniſhed by the Saxon laws, particularly thoſe of king Athelſtan, with death ; which was alſo agreeable to the old Gothic or Scandinavian conſtitution. But this was afterwards thought too hard : and in its ſtead another ſevere, but not capital, puniſhment was inflicted by william the Conqueror, viz. caſtration and loſs oſ eyes ; which continued till after Bracton wrote, in the reign of Henry III. But in order to prevent malicious accuſations, it was then the law, (and, it ſeems, ſtill continues to be ſo in appeals of rape), that the woman ſhould, immediately after, go to the next town, and there make diſcovery to ſome credible perſons of the injury ſhe has ſuffered ; and afterwards ſhould acquaint the high conſtable of the hundred, the coroners, and the ſheriff, with the outrage. This ſeems to correfpond in ſome degree with the laws of Scotland and Arragon, which require that complaint muſt be made within 24 hours : though afterwards by ſtatute w’eſtm. I. c. 13. the time of limitation in England was extended to 40 days. At preſent there is no ∙ time of limitation fixed: for, as it is uſuaſly now puniſhed by indictment at the fuit of the king, the maxim of law takes place, that " nullum tempus occurrit regi but the jury will rarely give credit to a ſtale complaint. During the former period alſo it was held for law, that the woman (by conſent of the judge and her parents) might redeem the offender from the execution of his ſentence, by accepting him for her huſhand ; if he alſo ■ wa⅛ willing to agree to the exchange* but not otherwiſe.</p><p>In the 3 Edw. I. by the ftatuté weſtſh. r. c. 13. the puniſhment of rape was much mitigated : the of--fence itſelf, of raviſhing a damſel within age, (that is, twelve years old) either with her conſent or without, or of any other woman againſt her will, being reduced to a trefpaſs,· if not proſccuted by appeal within 40 days, and ſubjecting the offender onIy to two years impriſon-ment, and a fine-at the king’s will.· But this lenity being productive of the moſt terrible conſequences, it was, in ten years afterwards, 13 Edw. I. found ncceffa-ιy to make the offence of forcible rape felony by ſtatute w^eftm. 2. c. 34. And by ſtatute 18 Eliz. c. 7. it is made felony without benefit of clergy : as is alſo the abominable wickedneſs of carnaſly knowing or abuſing any woman-child under the age of ten years ; in which caſe the conſent or non-confent is immaterial, as by reaſon of her tender years ſhe is incapable of judgment and diſcretion. Sir Matthew Hale is indeed of opinion, that ſuch profligate actions committed on an infant under the age of twelve years, the age oi female diſcretion by the common law, either with or without conſent, amount to rape and felony·; as well ſincc as before the ſtatute of queen Elizabeth : but that law has in general been held only to extend to infants under ten ; though it fnould ſeem that damſels between ten and twelve are ſtiil under the protection of the ſtatute wctlm. 1. the lav/ with reſpect to their ſeduction not having been al-tered by either of the ſubfequent ſtatutes.</p><p>A male infant, under the age. of fourteen years, is</p>

<p>preſumed by law incapable to commit a rape, and therefore it ſeems cannot be found guilty of it. For though in other felonies " malitia ſupplet ætatem yet, as to this particular fpecies of felony, the law ſup-poſes an imbecillity of body as well as mind.</p><p>The civil law ſeems to ſuppoſe a proſtitute or common harlot incapable of any injuries of this kind: not allowing any puniſhment for violating the chaſtity of her, who hath indeed no chaſtity at all, or at leaſt hath no regard to it. But the law of England does not judge ſo hardly of offenders, as to cut off all op-portunity of retreat even from common ſtrumpets, and to treat them as never capable of amendment. It therefore holds it to be felony to force even a concubine or harlot ; becauſe the woman may have forſaken that unlawful courſe of life : for, as Bracton well obſerves, " licet merctriχ fuerit antea, certe tunc temporis non fuit, cum reclaιnando nequitiæ ejus con-ſentire noluit.”</p><p>As to the material facts requiſite to be given in evi-dencε and proved upon an indictment of rape, they are of ſuch a nature, that, though neceſſary to be known and ſettled, for the conviction of the guiky and preſervation of the innocent, and therefore are to be found in ſuch criminal treatiſes as diſcourſe of theſe matters in detail, yet they are highly improper to be publicly dif-cuſſed, except only in a court of juſtice. we ſhall therefore merely add upon this head a few remarks from Sir Matthew Hale, with regard to the competen-ey and credibility of witneffes ; which may, <hi rend="italic">ſalvo pudore,</hi> be conſidered.</p><p>And, firſt, the party raviſhed may give evidence upon oath, aud is in law a competent witneſs ; but the credi-bility of her teſtimony, and how far forth ſhe is to be believed, muſt be left to the jury upon the circumſtances of fact that concur in that teſtimony. For inſtance : if the witneſs be of good fame; if ſhe preſently diſcovered the offence, and made ſearch for the offender; if the party accuſed fled for it ; thele and the like are concurring circumſtances, which give greater probability to her evidence. But, on the other ſide, if ſhe be of evil fame, and ſtand unſupported by others ; if ſhe con-cealed£the injury for any conſiderable time after ſhe had opportunity to complain ; if the place, where the fact was alleged to be committed, was where it was poſſible ſhe might have been heard, and ſhe made no outcry : theſe and the like circumſtances carry a ſtrong, but not concluſive, preſumption that her teſtimony is falſe or feigned.</p><p>Moreover, if the rape be charged to be committed on an infant under 12 years of age, ſhe may ſtill be a competent witneſs, if ſhe hath ſenfe and underſtanding to know the nature and obligations of an oath ; and, even if ſhe hath not, it is thought by Sir Matthew Hale, that ſhe ought to bc heard without oath, to give the court information ; though that alone will not be ſufficient to convict the offender. And he is of this opinion, ſirſt, Becauſe the nature of the offence being ſecret, there may be no other poſſiblc proof of the actual fact ; though afterwards there may be con-current circumſtances to corroborate it, proved by other witneffes : and, fccondly, Becauſe the law allows what the child told her mother, or other relations, to be given in evidence, ſince the nature of the cafe admits frequently of no better proof ; and there is much more reafon for the court to hear the narration of the child herfelf, than to receive it at ſecond-hand from thoſe who ſwear they heard her fay ſo. And indeed it feems now to be fettled, that in theſij caſes infants of any age are to be heard ; and, if they have any idea of an oath, to be alſo fworn ; it being found by experience, that infants of very tender years often give the cleareſt and trueſt teſtimony. But in any of theſe caſes, whether the child be fworn or not, it is to be wiſhed, in order to render her evidence credible, that there ſhould be ſome concurrent teſtimony of time, place, and circumſtances, in order to make out the fact ; and that the conviction ſhould not be grounded ſingly on the unfupported accuſation of an infant under years of diſcretion. There may be therefore, in many caſes of this nature, witneffes who are competent, that is, who may be admitted to be heard ; and yet, after being heard, may prove not to be credible, or ſuch as the jury is bound to believe. For one excellence of the trial by jury is, that the jury are triers of the credit of the witneffes, as well as of the truth of the fact.</p><p>" It is true (fays this learned judge), that rape is a moſt deteſtable crime, and therefore ought ſeverely and impartially to be puniſhed with death ; but it muſt be remembered, that it is an accuſation eaſy to be made, hard to be proved, but harder to be defended by the party accufed, though innocent.” He then relates two very extraordinary cafes of malicious proſecution for this crime, that had happened within his own ob- -ſervation ; and concludes thus : " I mention thefe inſtances, that we may be the more cautious upon trials of offences of this nature, wherein the court and jury may with ſo much eafe be impoſed upon, without great care and vigilance ; the heinoufneſs of the offence many times tranſporting the judge and jury with fo much indignation, that they are over-haſtily carried to the conviction of the perſons accnſed thereof, by the confident teſtimony of ſometimes falſe and malicious witneffes.”</p>
