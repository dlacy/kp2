<p><span class="font0">The salinity of the waters is relatively great, the highest recorded being 42·7 per mille (Gulf of Suez), and the lowest 36·2 (Perim harbour). The distribution is, speaking&nbsp;generally, the opposite to that of temperature; salinity&nbsp;increases from the surface downwards, and from the south north-wards, and it is greater towards the western than the eastern side.&nbsp;This statement holds good for the Gulf of Suez, in which the water&nbsp;is much salter than in the open sea; but in the Gulf of Akaba&nbsp;the distribution is exceedingly uniform, nowhere differing much</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">from an average of 40·6 per mille.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The movements of the waters arc of great irregularity and complexity, rendering navigation difficult and dangerous. Two features stand out with special distinctness: the exchange of water between the Red Sea and the Indian&nbsp;Ocean, and the tidal streams of the Gulf of Suez.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From the observations of salinity it is inferred that a surface current flows inwards to the Red Sea in the eastern channel of the&nbsp;Strait of Bab el-Mandeb, while a current of very salt water flows&nbsp;outward to the Indian Ocean, through the western channel, at a&nbsp;depth of 50 to 100 fathoms from the surface. In the Gulfs of Suez&nbsp;and Akaba, almost the only Dart of the Red Sea in which tidal&nbsp;phenomena are well developed, a sharply defined tidal circulation&nbsp;is found. Elsewhere the surface movements at least are controlled&nbsp;by the prevailing winds, which give rise in places to complex&nbsp;“ transverse&quot; currents, and near the coast arc modified by the&nbsp;channels enclosed by the coral reefs. During the prevalence of&nbsp;the north and north-west winds the surface level of the northern&nbsp;part of the Red Sea is depressed by as much as 2 ft. The great&nbsp;evaporation going on from the surface probably causes a slow vertical&nbsp;circulation in the depth, the salter colder waters sinking, and&nbsp;ultimately escaping to the Indian Ocean. Extensive collections&nbsp;of the deposits forming the bed were made by the expeditions&nbsp;of the Austrian ship “ Pola ” (1896 and 1898). These were analysed&nbsp;by Dr K. Natterer, whose conclusions, however, have been disputed&nbsp;by a number of other investigators. The zoological collections&nbsp;of the &quot;Pola&quot; expeditions show that certain well-defined districts&nbsp;are extremely rich in plankton, while others </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">are</span><span class="font0"> correspondingly&nbsp;poor; and it appears that the latter occur in districts surrounded&nbsp;by currents of relatively low temperature, while the richer parts&nbsp;are where the movements of water are blocked by irregularities&nbsp;in the coast-line.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REDSHANK, the usual name of a bird—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scolopax calidris </span><span class="font1">of Linnaeus and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tetanus calidris</span><span class="font1"> of modern authors—so called&nbsp;in English from the colour of the bare part of its legs, which,&nbsp;being also long, are conspicuous as it flies or runs. In suitable&nbsp;localities it is abundant throughout the greater part of Europe&nbsp;and Asia, from Iceland to China, mostly retiring to the south-ward for the winter, though a considerable number remain&nbsp;during that season along the coasts and estuaries of some of the&nbsp;more northern countries. Before the great changes effected by&nbsp;drainage in England it was a common species in many districts,&nbsp;but at the present day there are very few to which it can resort&nbsp;for the purpose of reproduction. The body of the redshank is&nbsp;as big as a snipe’s, but its longer neck, wings and legs make&nbsp;it appear a much larger bird. Above, the general colour is&nbsp;greyish-drab, freckled with black, except the lower part of&nbsp;the back and a conspicuous band on each wing, which are white,&nbsp;while the flight-quills are black, thus producing a very har-monious effect. In the breeding season the back and breast&nbsp;are mottled with dark brown, but in winter the latter is white.&nbsp;The nest is generally concealed in a tuft of rushes or grass, a&nbsp;little removed from the wettest parts of the swamp whence the&nbsp;bird gets its sustenance, and contains four eggs, usually of a&nbsp;rather warmly tinted brown with blackish spots or blotches;&nbsp;but no brief description can be given that would point out their&nbsp;differences from the eggs of other birds, more or less akin, among&nbsp;which, those of the lapwing (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font1">) especially, they arc taken&nbsp;and find a ready sale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The name Redshank, prefixed by some epithet as Black, Dusky or Spotted, has also been applied to a larger but allied species—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tοtanus fuscus</span><span class="font0"> of ornithologists. This is a much less common bird, and in Great Britain as well as the greater part of Europe it&nbsp;only occurs on its passage to or from its breeding-grounds, which&nbsp;arc usually found south of the Arctic Circle, and differ much from&nbsp;those of its congeners—the spot chosen for the nest being nearly&nbsp;always in the midst of forests and, though not in the thickest part&nbsp;of them, often with trees on all sides, generally where a fire has&nbsp;cleared the undergrowth, and mostly at some distance from water.&nbsp;This peculiar habit was first ascertained by Wolley in Lapland in&nbsp;1853 and the following year. The breeding-dress this bird assumes&nbsp;is also very remarkable, and seems (as is suggested) to have some&nbsp;correlation with the burnt and blackened surface interspersed with&nbsp;white stones or tufts of lichen on which its nest is made—for the&nbsp;head, neck, shoulders and lower parts are of a deep black, con-trasting vividly with the pure white of the back and rump, while&nbsp;the legs become of an intense crimson. At other times of the year&nbsp;the plumage is very similar to that of the common redshank, and&nbsp;the legs arc of the same light orange-red.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A. N.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REDSTART, a bird well known in Great Britain, in many parts of which it is called firetail—a name of almost the same&nbsp;meaning, since “ start ’’ is from the Anglo-Saxon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">steart,</span><span class="font1"> a tail.&nbsp;This beautiful bird, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruticilla phoenicurus,</span><span class="font1"> returns to England&nbsp;about the middle or towards the end of April, and at once takes&nbsp;up its abode in gardens, orchards and about old buildings,&nbsp;when its curious habit of flirting at nearly every change of&nbsp;position its brightly-coloured tail, together with the pure white&nbsp;forehead, the black throat, and bright bay breast of the cock,&nbsp;renders him conspicuous, even if attention be not drawn by his&nbsp;lively though intermittent song. The hen is much more plainly&nbsp;attired; but the characteristic colouring and action of the tail&nbsp;pertain to her equally as to her mate. The nest is almost&nbsp;always placed in a hole of a tree or building, and contains from&nbsp;five to seven eggs of a delicate greenish blue, occasionally sprinkled&nbsp;with faint red spots. The young on assuming their feathers&nbsp;present a great resemblance to those of the redbreast (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">q.v.</span><span class="font1">)</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> </span><span class="font1">at the same age; but the red tail, though of duller hue than in&nbsp;the adult, forms even at this early age an easy means of distinguishing them. The redstart breeds regularly in all the&nbsp;counties of England and Wales. It also reaches the extreme&nbsp;north of Scotland; but in Ireland it is very rare. It appears&nbsp;throughout the whole of Europe in summer, and is known to&nbsp;winter in the interior of Africa. Several very nearly allied&nbsp;forms occur in Asia; and one, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. aurorea,</span><span class="font1"> in Japan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A congeneric species which has received the name of black redstart, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruticilla titys,@@<sup>i</sup></span><span class="font1"> is very common throughout the greater&nbsp;part of the continent of Europe, where, from its partiality for&nbsp;gardens in towns and villages, it is often better known than the&nbsp;preceding species. It yearly occurs in certain parts of England,&nbsp;chiefly along or near the south coast, and curiously enough&nbsp;during the autumn and winter, since it is in central Europe only&nbsp;a summer visitor, and it has by no means the high northern&nbsp;range of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">phoenicurus.</span><span class="font1"> The males of the black redstart seem&nbsp;to be more than one year in acquiring their full plumage (a rare&nbsp;thing in Passerine birds), and since they have been known to&nbsp;breed in the intermediate stage this fact has led to such birds&nbsp;being accounted a distinct species under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. cairii,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">thereby perplexing ornithologists for a long while, though now&nbsp;almost all authorities agree that these birds are, in one sense,&nbsp;immature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">More than a dozen species of the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ruticilla</span><span class="font1"> have been described, and the greater number of them seem to belong to the&nbsp;Himalayan sub-region or its confines. One very pretty and&nbsp;interesting form is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. moussieri</span><span class="font1"> of Barbary, which allies the&nbsp;redstart to the stone-chats (see Wheatear), and of late some&nbsp;authors have included it in that genus. In an opposite direction&nbsp;the bluethroats, apparently nearer to the redstarts than to any&nbsp;other type, arc placed in the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cyanecula,</span><span class="font1"> containing two&nbsp;or three distinguishable forms: (1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">C.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">suecica,</span><span class="font1"> with a bright&nbsp;bay spot in the middle of its clear blue throat, breeding in&nbsp;Scandinavia, Northern Russia and Siberia, and wintering in&nbsp;Abyssinia and India, though rarely appearing in the intermediate&nbsp;countries, to the wonder of all who have studied the migration</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1</sup> The orthography of the specific term would seem to be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">titis (Ann. Nat. History, ser.</span><span class="font0"> 4, x. p. 227), a word possibly cognate with&nbsp;the first syllable of titlark and titmouse.</span></p>
