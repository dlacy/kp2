            <p>præa in Italy, and chiefly inhabited the promontory of Minerva, upon the top of which
                that goddeſs had a temple, as ſome affirm, built by Ulyſſes. Here there was a
                renowned academy, in the reign of the Sirens, famous for eloquence and the liberal
                ſciences, which gave occaſion to the invention of this fable of the ſweetneſs of the
                voice and attracting ſongs of the Sirens. But why then are they fabled to be
                deſtroyers, and painted in ſuch dreadful colours ? We are told, that at laſt the
                ſtudents abuſed their knowledge, to the colouring of wrong, the corruption of
                manners, and the ſubversion of government; that is, in the language of poetry, they
                were feigned to be transformed into monſters, and with their muſic to have enticed
                paſſengers to their ruin, who there conſumed their patrimonies, and poiſoned their
                virtues with riot and effeminacy. The place is now called <hi rend="italic"
                    >Maſſa.</hi> Some writers tell us of a certain bay, contracted within winding
                ſtraits and broken cliffs, which, by the ſinging of the winds and beating of the
                waters, returns a delightful harmony, that allures the paſſenger to approach, who is
                immediately thrown againſt the rocks, and ſwallowed up by the violent eddies. Thus
                Horace, moraliling, calls idleneſs a <hi rend="italic">Siren.</hi></p>

            </lg>
            <p>But the fable may be applied to all pleaſures in general, which, if too eagerly
                purſued, betray the incautious into ruin ; while wise men, like Ulyſſes, making uſe
                of their reason, ſtop their ears againſt their inſinuations.</p>
            <p>The learned Mr Bryant ſays, that the Sirens were Cuthite and Canaanitiſh prieſts, who
                had founded temples in Sicily, which were rendered infamous on account of the women
                who officiated. They were much addicted to cruel rites, ſo that the ſhores upon
                which they reſided are deſcribed as covered with the bones of men deſtroyed by their
                artifice. <hi rend="italic">Virgil. Æneid.</hi> lib. v. v. 864.</p>
            <p>All ancient authors agree in telling us, that Sirens inhabited the coaſt of Sicily.
                The name, according to Bochart, who derives it from the Phoenician language, implies
                a ſongſtress. Hence it is probable, ſays Dr Burney, that in ancient times there may
                have been excellent fingers, but of corrupt morals, on the coaſt of Sicily, who, by
                ſeducing voyagers, gave rise to this fable. And if this conjecture be well founded,
                he obſerves, the Muſes are not the only pagan divinities who preſerved their
                influence over mankind in modern times ; for every age has its Sirens, and every
                Siren her votaries ; when beauty and talents, both powerful in themſelves, are
                united, they become ſtill more attractive.</p>

                brachiated with claws.@@ This animal was diſcovered by Dr Garden in Carolina ; it is
                found in ſwampy and muddy places, by the sides of pools, under the trunks of old
                trees that hang over the water. The natives call it by the name of <hi rend="italic"

                lizard ; but as its fingers are furniſhed with claws, and it makes a croaking noiſe,
                he concluded from theſe properties, as</p>
            <p>well as from the ſituation of the anus, that it could not be the larva of the lizard,
                and therefore formed of it a new genus under the name of si<hi rend="italic"

            <p>SIRLET (Flavius), an eminent Roman engraver on precious ſtones : his Lacoon, and
                repreſentations in miniature of antique ſtatues at Rome, are very valuable and

            <p>SIROCCO, a periodical wind which generally blows in Italy and Dalmatia every year
                about Eaſter. It blows from the ſouth-eaſt by ſouth : it is attended with heat, but
                not rain ; its ordinary period is twenty days, and it uſually ceaſes at ſunset.@@
                When the ſcirocco does not blow in this manner, the ſummer is almoſt free from
                weſterly winds, whirlwinds, and ſtorms. This wind is prejudicial to plants, drying
                and burning up the buds ; though it hurts not men any otherwise than by cauſing an
                extraordinary weakneſs and laſſitude; inconveniences that are fully compenſated by a
                plentiful fiſhing, and a good crop of corn on the mountains. In the ſummer time,
                when the weſterly wind ceaſes for a day, it is a ſign that the firocco will blow the
                day following, which uſually begins with a sort of whirlwind.</p>

            <p>I. The <hi rend="italic">amomum,</hi> common barſtard parſley, or field ſtone- wort,
                is a biennial plant about three feet high, growing wild in many places of Britain.
                Its ſeeds are ſmall, ſtriated, of an oval figure and brown colour. Their taſte is
                warm and aromatic. Their whole flavour is extracted by ſpirit of wine, which
                elevates very little of it in diſtillation ; and hence the ſpirituous extract has
                the flavour in great perfection, while the watery extract has very little. A
                tincture drawn with pure ſpirit is of a green colour. The ſeeds have been eſteemed
                aperient, diuretic, and carminative ; but are little regarded in the preſent
