<p><span class="font1">the fifth digit. Thc claws of many geckos are “ retractile,” like those of cats; the adhesive lamellae on the under side of their&nbsp;digits have already been described (sec </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gecko).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nervous System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The hemispheres are still much longer than broad, and pass, especially in lizards, graddally into the olfactory lobes,&nbsp;into which continue the ventricles of the hemispheres.&nbsp;The dorsaI walls of these are thin, especially in crocodiles,&nbsp;although they possess already a considerable amount of grey&nbsp;matter. The hasal masses of the fore-brain bulge into the&nbsp;roomy ventricles like cushions. Fibres referable to a corpus&nbsp;callosum are scarcely separated from those of the still much&nbsp;stronger anterior commissure. The epiphysis comes to the&nbsp;surface between the hinder parts of the hemispheres. The&nbsp;pineaI eye is described below under </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sense Organs.</span><span class="font1"> The hypophysis has hyjt a shallow infundihulum. The mid-brain shows&nbsp;a pair of dorsal globular swellings, each with a cavity; they&nbsp;separate the hemispheres from the cerebellum. Of the hindbrain, the middle portion is by far the largest; although the&nbsp;dorsal wall of this cerebellum is thick, and rich in grey matter,&nbsp;ift surface is still quite smooth and it shows no trace of an&nbsp;arbor vitae. It covers but a small portion of the wide fourth&nbsp;ventricle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The spinal cord shows a brachial and a lumbar longitudinal swelling, especially marked in tortoises, but without a rhom-hoidaI sinus. The cord is continued into the end of the tail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The cranial nerves of the reptiles agree in their arrangement and distribution more with those of birds and mammals than&nbsp;with those of the Batrachia. The facial nerve sends a palatine&nbsp;branch to the palate and to the superior maxillary of the trigeminus, and a strong mandibular branch joins the third of the&nbsp;trigeminal, and further ramifications supply the sphincter&nbsp;muscle of the neck. The vagus and glossopharyngeus leave&nbsp;the cranium separately. The vagus then goes towards the&nbsp;heart, which in the&nbsp;Sauropsida is far removed from the head,&nbsp;and there possesses&nbsp;another ganglion, variously called ganglion&nbsp;trunci vagi or g.&nbsp;nodosum. It is connected hy a nerve&nbsp;with the large ganglion supremum of the&nbsp;sympathetic. From&nbsp;the cardiac ganglion,&nbsp;and from the continuation of the&nbsp;vagus, are sent off&nbsp;several branches in&nbsp;succession, which,&nbsp;having to pass below&nbsp;or tailwards from the transverse carotic, aortic and Botal-lian vessels, have to take again a headward course to the&nbsp;larynx and pharynx; a side branch enters the heart by its&nbsp;truncus. The main mass of the vagus then supplies&nbsp;lungs, stomach and further viscera. The accessory or nth&nbsp;cranial nerve arises with about haIf a dozen roots which extend&nbsp;often beyond the second cranial nerve; they collect into a&nbsp;thin stem which leaves the cranium together with the vagus,&nbsp;with which it is often fused; it supplies the cucullaris s. trarepius&nbsp;muscle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The hypoglossus arises hy two ventral roots, leaving the skull by two holes through the lateral occipital bone, near&nbsp;the condyle. The united stem is invariably joined by strong&nbsp;branches from cervical nerves, always from the first, mostly&nbsp;also from the second, sometimes also from the third. The details&nbsp;vary much; occasionally there are three craniaI roots and&nbsp;foramina, and then only the first cervical joins the hypo-gIossus; this often fuses with the glossopharyngeal or with&nbsp;the vagus. In the broad and well-muscularized tongue of the&nbsp;crocodiles the right and left hypoglossal branches form a complete ansa, an arrangement in which A. Schneider saw the&nbsp;Infraocsophageal nerve ring of Invertebratal</span></p><div>
<p></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">The spinal nerves each issue behind, or through, thc neural arch of the vertebra to which they belong genetically. The&nbsp;first spinal, or suboccipital, nerve has no dorsal roots, and,&nbsp;having lost its vertebra, an apparently anomalous arrangement&nbsp;has come to pass, in this way, that there arc x cervical vertebrae,&nbsp;but x + i cervical nerves, a condition prevailing in, and characteristic of, all Amniota. The hypoglossal-cervical plexus is&nbsp;separated from the brachial plexus by severaI metameres,&nbsp;according to the Iength of the neck. The brachiaI plexus&nbsp;is composed of ahout 5 nerves; the variations have been studied&nbsp;chiefly by M. Flirhringer. It is interesting to note that the&nbsp;brachiaI pIexus still persists in snakes, although they have&nbsp;CompIetely lost the anterior girdle and the limbs (Albertina&nbsp;Carlsson). A disturbance in the pelvic region likewise indicates in snakes the former existence of a pelvic or Iumbo-sacraI&nbsp;plexus, which in limbed reptiles is composed of about 5 nerves,&nbsp;the last of which is weak and in many cases (hy no means the&nbsp;rule) issues hetween the two sacral vertebrae, sending one&nbsp;branch to the ischiadic, another to the public plexus which&nbsp;supplies the cloacal region. (For details of these pIexuses see&nbsp;the papers by Mivart, Jhering and Gadow.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sympathetic system shows considerable modifications in the various orders and even families of the reptiles. In the&nbsp;neck region, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font1"> and most lizards it is*, on thc right&nbsp;and left side, composed of two portions. One, more IateraI&nbsp;and placed deeply, runs along the side of the vertebraI column,&nbsp;starting from the first and second spinal nerves, with which&nbsp;it is connected by. so-called rami communicantes; it is not connected with the other spinal nerves until it reaches, in the&nbsp;thorax, the first stem of the brachial plexus, and hereabout&nbsp;lies the so-called second thoracic ganglion. The other, superficial and more ventral, portion arises from the petrosal ganglion of the glossopharyngeal, and from the vagus ganglion, and&nbsp;then forms a long loop which joins the second thoracic ganglion. In its long course it sometimes, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Varanus,</span><span class="font1"> forms&nbsp;one common stem with the vagus before it splits off. At a&nbsp;variable distance, but not far above the heart, the vagus possesses a big swelling, the ganglion trunci vagi, and the sympathetic stem, in the same level, or farther down, has likewise&nbsp;a large ganglion, the g. supremum vagi, or first thoracic ganglion. The vagus ganglion receives several nerve strands from&nbsp;this big sympathetic ganglion, and then divides as described&nbsp;above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the crocodiles the deep portion of the sympathetic hegins at the vagus and extends in rope-ladder fashion into the thorax,&nbsp;there heing, as in hirds, regular transverse communicating&nbsp;hranches with the spinal nerves, and the longitudinal strands&nbsp;run through the transverse foramina between the capitular and&nbsp;tuhercular portions of the cervical ribs. The other, ventral, portion starts by a right and a left branch from the vagus ganglia,&nbsp;hut hoth hranches unite at once into one unpaired stem, which&nbsp;is deepIy embedded in the middle line between the ventral&nbsp;muscles of the cervical vertebrae. Very thin branches connect&nbsp;this unpaired stem with the right and Ieftsympatheticportions;&nbsp;small ganglia are embedded in the unpaired nerve.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The so-called second thoracic ganglion is in reality a compound of all the sympathetic ganglia of the four or five metameres of&nbsp;the hrachial plexus. It forms the point of juncture of the deep&nbsp;and the SuperficiaI cervical sympathetic portions. From the&nbsp;posterior region of the thorax backwards the right and left&nbsp;strands run along their side of the vertebral coIumn, with a&nbsp;communicating branch and a ganglion for each metamere;&nbsp;sometimes one or more successive ganglia are combined, for&nbsp;instance near thc cloaca. After having supplied the latter, thc&nbsp;sympathetic system appears exhausted and is continued into the&nbsp;taiI by but a very thin strand, which runs between the caudal&nbsp;vein and artery. The best iIIustrations of the sympathetic&nbsp;system are those by Vogt (neck of crocodile), J. G. Fischer (many</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
