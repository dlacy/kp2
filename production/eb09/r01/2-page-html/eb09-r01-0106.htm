<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">May 1781. His father (who died in 1822) was much esteemed in Anhalt, where, as “ kammerdirector,” he did&nbsp;excellent service to agriculture. Raumer was educated at&nbsp;the Joachimsthal Gymnasium, Berlin, and at the universities of Halle and Göttingen. In 1801 he began to practise&nbsp;as a lawyer in the Brandenburg chamber, and in the following year he was made assessor. From 1806 to 1808 he was&nbsp;connected with a department of the crown lands chamber&nbsp;at Wusterhausen near Berlin. Having been made a councillor in 1809, he was called in 1810 to a post in the office&nbsp;for the national debt, and soon afterwards received an&nbsp;appointment in the bureau of the chancellor, Hardenberg.&nbsp;He was made a professor at the university of Breslau in&nbsp;1811, and in 1819 he became professor of political science&nbsp;and history at Berlin. In 1815 he had carried on historical investigations in Venice, and in the two following years&nbsp;he had travelled much in Germany, Switzerland, and Italy.&nbsp;At Berlin he was for some time a member of the Upper&nbsp;Board of Censors and secretary of the Academy of Sciences.&nbsp;The former office he resigned in 1831, the latter in 1847.&nbsp;His professorship at the Berlin university he did not give&nbsp;up until 1853, and even then he did not altogether cease&nbsp;to lecture. In 1848 he was elected a member of the&nbsp;national assembly at Frankfort, where he associated himself with the right centre ; and from Frankfort he was&nbsp;sent on a mission to Paris. At a later period he was a&nbsp;member of the first chamber of the Prussian parliament.&nbsp;He died at Berlin on 14th June 1873. Raumer made&nbsp;many contributions to history, in all of which he embodied&nbsp;the results of independent research and gave evidence of a&nbsp;sound and penetrating judgment. His style is direct,&nbsp;lucid, and vigorous, and his best books have been as warmly&nbsp;appreciated by ordinary readers as by scholars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">His first work, published anonymously in 1806, was entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Sechs Dialoge über Krieg und Handel.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> This was followed by </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Das&nbsp;britische Besteuerungssystem</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1810), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Handbuch merkwürdiger Stellen&nbsp;aus den lateinischen Geschichtschreibern des Mittelalters</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1813),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Herbstreise nach Venedig</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1816), and other books. His most famous&nbsp;works are </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Geschichte der Hohenstaufen und ihrer Zeit</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1823-25) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Geschichte Europas seit dem Ende des löten Jahrhunderts</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1832-50).&nbsp;In 1831 appeared </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Briefe aus Paris und Frankreich im Jahre 1830&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Briefe aus Paris zur Erläuterung der Geschichte des 16ten und&nbsp;17ten Jahrhunderts.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> He went to England in 1835, to Italy in 1839,&nbsp;and to America in 1843, and these visits led to the publication of&nbsp;various works—</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">England in 1835</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1836), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Beiträge zur neuern Geschichte aus dem Britischen Museum und Reichsarchive</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1836-39),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Italien, Beiträge zur Kenntniss dieses Landes</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1840), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Die Vereinigten&nbsp;Staaten von Nordamerika</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1845). Among his later books maybe mentioned .4 ?zAg'UartscAe </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Briefe</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1851), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Historisch-politische Briefe über&nbsp;die geselligen Verhältnisse der Menschen</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1860), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Lebenserinnerungen&nbsp;und Briefvjechsel</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1861), and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Handbuch zur Geschichte der Literatur&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1864-66). In 1830 Raumer began the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Historisches Taschenbuch&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">published by Brockhaus, which from 1871 was continued by Riehl.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAUPACH, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Ernst Benjamin Salomo </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1784-1852), German dramatic writer, was born on the 21st of April&nbsp;1784 at Straupitz, a village near Liegnitz in Silesia. He&nbsp;attended the gymnasium at Liegnitz and afterwards studied&nbsp;theology at Halle. He spent a good many years in Russia&nbsp;as a teacher, and in 1816 was made a professor in the&nbsp;university of St Petersburg. In 1822 he left Russia, and&nbsp;after travelling for some time in Italy settled as a writer&nbsp;for the stage in Berlin, where he remained during the rest&nbsp;of his life. He died at Berlin on the 18th of March 1852.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Raupach was not a man of imaginative genius, but he had remarkable skill in the invention of effective dramatic situations, and was master of a vigorous rhetorical style. These qualities secured&nbsp;for him a prominent place among the most popular dramatic writers&nbsp;of his day. He wrote both tragedies ana comedies, and was the&nbsp;author of a series of dramas representing the great events of the&nbsp;age of the Hohenstaufen.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAVAILLAC, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">François </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">(1578-1610), the assassin of Henry IV. of France, was born near Angoulême in 1578.&nbsp;He was of humble origin, and began life as a valet de&nbsp;chambre, but afterwards became a petty solicitor and also</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">teacher of a school. He was not able, however, to keep clear of debt, and after having been imprisoned for some time&nbsp;by his creditors he sought admission to the recently founded&nbsp;order of Feuillants, but after a short probation was dismissed as a visionary. An application for admission to&nbsp;the Society of Jesus was equally unsuccessful in 1606.&nbsp;His various disappointments tended to foster a violently&nbsp;fanatical temperament, and widely-spread rumours that&nbsp;the king was intending to make war upon the pope suggested to him the idea of assassination, which he deliberately and successfully carried out on 14th May 1610. In&nbsp;the course of his trial he was frequently put to the torture,&nbsp;but persistently (and it is now believed truly) denied that&nbsp;he had been prompted by any one or had any accomplices.&nbsp;Sentence of death was carried out with revolting barbarity&nbsp;on 27 th May.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">RAVEN (Anglo-Saxon </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hrsefn,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Icelandic </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Hrafn,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Danish </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Ravn,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Dutch </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Raaf</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">, German </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rabe),</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the largest of the Birds&nbsp;of the Order </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Passeres ·,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and, as already shewn </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(Ornithology, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. xviii. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">p. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">49), probably the most highly&nbsp;developed of all Birds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Quick-sighted, sagacious, and bold, it must have followed the prehistoric fisher and hunter, and generally without molestation&nbsp;from them, to prey on the refuse of their spoils, just as it now waits,&nbsp;with the same intent, on the movements of their successors ; while&nbsp;it must have likewise attended the earliest herdsmen, who could&nbsp;not have regarded it with equal indifference, since its now notorious&nbsp;character for attacking and putting to death a weakly animal was&nbsp;doubtless in those days manifested. Yet the Raven is no mere&nbsp;dependant upon man, being always able to get a living for itself;&nbsp;and moreover a sentiment of veneration or superstition has from&nbsp;very remote ages and among many races of men attached to it—a&nbsp;sentiment so strong as often to overcome the feeling of distrust not to&nbsp;say of hatred which its deeds inspired, and, though rapidly decreasing, even to survive in some places until the present day. There&nbsp;is no need to dwell on the association of this bird with well-known&nbsp;characters of history sacred or profane—Noah or Elijah, Odin or&nbsp;Flokki, the last of whom by its means discovered Iceland. The&nbsp;Raven is even said to have played its part in the mythology of the&nbsp;Red Indian ; and none can wonder that all this should be so, since,&nbsp;wherever it occurs and more especially wherever it is numerous, as&nbsp;in ancient times and in thinly peopled countries it must have been,&nbsp;its size, appearance, and fearless habits would be sure to attract&nbsp;especial attention. Nor has this attention wholly ceased with the&nbsp;advance of enlightenment, for both in prose and verse, from the&nbsp;time of Shakespeare to that of Poe and Dickens, the Raven has&nbsp;often figured, and generally without the amount of misrepresentation which is the fate of most animals which celebrated writers&nbsp;condescend to notice. Notwithstanding all this, however, the&nbsp;Raven has now fallen upon evil days. The superstitious reverence&nbsp;with which it was once regarded has all but vanished and has been&nbsp;very generally succeeded by persecution, which in many districts&nbsp;has produced actual extirpation, so that it is threatened with extinction, save in the wildest and most unpeopled districts.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The Raven breeds very early in the year, in England resorting to its nest, which is usually an ancient if not an&nbsp;ancestral structure, about the middle or towards the end&nbsp;of January. Therein are laid from five to seven eggs of&nbsp;the common Corvine coloration (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Crow, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. vi. pp.&nbsp;617, 618), and the young are hatched before the end of&nbsp;February. In more northern countries the breeding-season&nbsp;is naturally delayed, but everywhere this species is almost&nbsp;if not quite the earliest of birds to enter upon tlie business</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> That all lovers of nature should take what steps they can to arrest this sad fate is a belief which the present writer fully holds. Without attempting to deny the loss which in some cases is inflicted upon&nbsp;the rearers of cattle by Ravens, it is an enormous mistake to suppose&nbsp;that the neighbourhood of a pair of these birds is invariably detrimental. On this point he can speak from experience. For many&nbsp;years he had an intimate knowledge of a pair occupying an inland&nbsp;locality surrounded by valuable flocks of sheep, and abounding in&nbsp;rabbits and game, and had ample opportunities, which he never&nbsp;neglected, of repeatedly examining the pellets of bones and </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">exuvise</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> that&nbsp;these, like all other carnivorous birds, cast up. He thus found that&nbsp;this pair of Ravens fed almost exclusively on moles. Soon after he&nbsp;moved from the neighbourhood in which they lived the unreasoning&nbsp;zeal of a gamekeeper (against, it is believed, the orders of his master)&nbsp;put an end to this interesting couple—the last of their species which&nbsp;inhabited the county.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
