the Arabian name of a hot wind peculiar to the deſert of Arabia.<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[mu'] <hi rend="italic">Ives's Voyage from England to India in 1754.</hi></p></note> It blows over the deſert in the months of July and Auguſt from the north-weſt quarter, and ſometimes it continues with all its violence to the very gates of <hi rend="italic">Bagdad,</hi> but never affects any body within the walls. Some years it does not blow at all, and in others it appears ſix, eight, or ten times, but ſeldom continues more than a few minutes at a time. It often paſſes with the apparent quickneſs of lightning. The Arabians and Perſians, who are acquainted with the appearance of the ſky at or near the time this wind ariſeth, have warning of its approach by a thick haze, which appears like a cloud of dull ariſing out of the horizon; and they immediately upon this appearance throw themſelves with their faces to the ground, and continue in that poſition till the wind is paſſed, which frequently happens almoſt inſtantaneouſly; but if, on the contrary, they are not careful or briſk enough to take this precaution, which is ſometimes the caſe, and they get the full force of the wind, it is inſtant death.</p><p>The above method is the only one which they take to avoid the effects of this fatal blaſt; and when it is over, they get up and look round them for their companions; and if they ſee any one lying motionleſs, they take hold of an arm or leg, and pull and jerk it with ſome force; and if the limb thus agitated ſeparates from the body, it is a certain ſign that the wind has had its full effect; but if, on the contrary, the arm or leg does not come away, it is a ſure ſign there is life remaining, although to every outward appearance the perſon is dead; and in that caſe they immediately cover him or them with clothes, and adminiſter ſome warm diluting liquor to cauſe a perſpiration, which is certainly but ſlowly brought about.</p><p>The Arabs themſelves can fay little or nothing about the nature of this wind, only that it always leaves behind it a very ſtrong ſulphureous ſmell, and that the air at theſe times is quite clear, except about the horizon, in the north-weſt quarter, before obſerved, which gives warning of its approach. We have not been able to learn whether the dead bodies are ſcorched, or diſſolved into a kind of gelatinous ſubſtance; but from the ſtories current about them, there has been frequent reaſon to believe the latter; and in that caſe ſuch fatal effects may be attributed rather to a noxious vapour than to an abſolute and exceſſive heat. The ſtory of its going to the gates of Bagdad and no farther may be reaſonably enough accounted for, if the effects are attributed to a poiſonous vapour, and not an exceſſive heat. The above mentioned wind, Samiel, is ſo well known in the neighbourhood of Bagdad and Baſſora, that the very children ſpeak of it with dread.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
