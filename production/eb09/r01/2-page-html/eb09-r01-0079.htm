<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Ramsden’s speciality was divided circles, which began to supersede the quadrants in observatories towards the end of the 18th century. His most celebrated work was a 5-feet vertical circle,&nbsp;which was finished in 1789 and was used by Piazzi at Palermo in&nbsp;constructing his well-known catalogue of stars. He was the first&nbsp;to carry out in practice a method of reading oif angles (first suggested&nbsp;in 1768 by the duke of Chaulnes) by measuring the distance of the&nbsp;index from the nearest division line by means of a micrometer screw&nbsp;which moves one or two fine threads placed in the focus of a microscope. Ramsden’s transit instruments were the first which were&nbsp;illuminated through the hollow axis; the idea was suggested to&nbsp;him by Professor Usslier in Dublin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAMSGATE, a seaport and watering-place of England, in the Isle of Tlianet, Kent, and a “ vill </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">”</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the old Cinque&nbsp;Port of Sandwich, is finely situated between chalk cliffs at&nbsp;the northern extremity of Pegwell Bay, on the London,&nbsp;Chatham, and Dover Railway, 79 miles east-south-east of&nbsp;London. It possesses a fine stretch of sand, and is much&nbsp;frequented as a Avatering-place. It first rose into importance in the beginning of the 18th century through its trade&nbsp;with Russia. In 1749 it was selected as a harbour of refuge&nbsp;for the Downs, and the erection of a pier under the direction of Smeaton was begun in 1787. The harbour has&nbsp;been improved at various periods, and now (1885) covers&nbsp;an area of 51 acres, enclosed by two piers, one about 1200&nbsp;and the other about 1500 feet in length, accommodation&nbsp;being afforded for as many as 400 sail. The limits of the&nbsp;port were extended in 1882. A considerable shipping&nbsp;trade in coal and provisions is carried on, and there is&nbsp;also a fleet of 150 vessels engaged in the North Sea fishery.&nbsp;A fine promenade pier was erected in 1881. The town&nbsp;possesses a town-hall (1839), assembly rooms, and extensive bathing establishments. The church of St George&nbsp;was built in 1826. There is a small Roman Catholic&nbsp;cathedral, built by Welby Pugin. The neighbouring Peg-well Bay, famed for its shrimps, is supposed to have been&nbsp;the scene of the landing of Hengist and Horsa, and at&nbsp;Cliff’s End (Ebbs Fleet) a monolithic cross marks the&nbsp;landing-place of St Augustine in 596. On the summit of&nbsp;Osengal Hill, about a mile to the west of the town, a&nbsp;graveyard of the early Saxon settlers was discovered during&nbsp;the cutting of the railway. Ramsgate was incorporated&nbsp;as a borough in 1884. The population of the urban&nbsp;sanitary district (area 2278 acres) in 1871 was 19,640,&nbsp;and in 1881 22,683, or, including 638 fishermen at sea,&nbsp;23,321.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">RAMUS, Peter, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">or </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Pierre de la Ramee </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1515-1572), logician, was born at the village of Cuth in Picardy in&nbsp;the year 1515. He ■was descended from a noble family,&nbsp;which had fallen, however, into such poverty that his&nbsp;father earned his livelihood as a field-labourer. The early&nbsp;death of his father increased Ramus’s difficulties in obtaining the education for which he thirsted. But at last his&nbsp;perseverance was rewarded by admission, in a menial&nbsp;capacity, to the college of Navarre. He worked with his&nbsp;hands by day and carried on his studies at night. The&nbsp;reaction against scholasticism was still in full tide; it was&nbsp;the transition time between the old and the new, when&nbsp;the eager and forward-looking spirits had first of all to do&nbsp;battle with scholastic Aristotelianism. In the domain of&nbsp;logic men like Laurentius Valla, Rudolphus Agricola, and&nbsp;Ludovicus Vives, imbued with the spirit of the Renaissance, had already invoked Cicero against the barbarous&nbsp;Latinity of the scholastic compends; and, following the&nbsp;same prototype, they had proposed various innovations&nbsp;which tended to assimilate logic to rhetoric. Ramus outdid his predecessors in the impetuosity of his revolt. He&nbsp;signalized himself on the occasion of taking his degree</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1536) by victoriously defending the daring thesis—Everything that Aristotle taught is false. This </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tour de force </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">was followed up by the publication in 1543 of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aristotélica&nbsp;Animadversiones</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dialecticæ Partitiones,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> the former a&nbsp;criticism on the old logic and the latter a new text-book of&nbsp;the science. What are substantially fresh editions of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Partitiones</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> appeared in 1547 as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Institutiones Dialecticæ,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and in 1548 as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Scholæ Dialecticæ·,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Dialectique,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> a French&nbsp;version of his system, is the earliest work on the subject&nbsp;in the French language. Meanwhile Ramus, as graduate&nbsp;of the university, had opened courses of lectures ; but his&nbsp;audacities drew upon him the determined hostility of the&nbsp;conservative party in philosophy and theology. He was&nbsp;accused of undermining the foundations of philosophy and&nbsp;religion, and the matter was brought before the parlement&nbsp;of Paris, and finally before the king. By him it was referred to a commission of five, who found Ramus guilty&nbsp;of having “acted rashly, arrogantly, and impudently,”&nbsp;and interdicted his lectures (1544). He withdrew from&nbsp;Paris, but soon afterwards returned, the decree against&nbsp;him being cancelled through the influence of the cardinal&nbsp;of Lorraine. In 1551 Henry II. appointed him professor&nbsp;of philosophy and eloquence at the Collège de France,&nbsp;where for a considerable time he enjoyed free scope for&nbsp;his energies. His incessant literary activity is proved by&nbsp;the fifty works which he published in his lifetime, to which&nbsp;must be added nine that appeared after his death. In&nbsp;1561, however, the slumbering enmity against Ramus was&nbsp;suddenly fanned into flame by his adoption of Protestantism. He had to flee from Paris for his life ; and, though&nbsp;he found an asylum in the palace of Fontainebleau, his&nbsp;house was pillaged and his library burned in his absence.&nbsp;He resumed his chair after this for a time, but in 1568&nbsp;the position of affairs was again so threatening that he&nbsp;found it advisable to ask permission to travel. He travelled&nbsp;mainly in Switzerland and Germany, residing some time&nbsp;in Basel, Heidelberg, Geneva, and Lausanne, and meeting&nbsp;everywhere with the most flattering reception. Returning&nbsp;to France, Ramus at last fell a victim to the inveterate&nbsp;hate of his opponents : he perished by the hands of hired&nbsp;assassins in the massacre of St Bartholomew (1572).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The logic of Ramus enjoyed a great celebrity for a time, and there existed a school of Ramists boasting numerous adherents&nbsp;in France, Germany, and Holland. As late as 1626 Burgersdyck&nbsp;divides the logicians of his day into the Aristotelians, the Ramists,&nbsp;and the Semi-Ramists, who endeavoured, like Goclenius of Marburg, to mediate between the contending parties. Ramus’s works&nbsp;appear among the logical text-books of the Scottish universities,&nbsp;and he was not without his followers in England in the 17th century. There is even a little treatise from the hand of Milton,&nbsp;published two years before his death, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Artis Logicæ Plenior&nbsp;Institutio ad Petri Rami Methodum concinnata.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> It cannot be said,&nbsp;however, that Ramus’s innovations mark any epoch in the history&nbsp;of logic ; and, though some of his additions have maintained their&nbsp;ground, he has made no contribution of fundamental importance&nbsp;to the science. His rhetorical leaning is seen in the definition of&nbsp;logic as the “ ars disserendi ” ; he maintains that the rules of logic&nbsp;may be better learned from observation of the way in which Cicero&nbsp;persuaded his hearers than from a study of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Organon.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> The distinction between natural and artificial logic, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> between the implicit logic of daily speech and the same logic made explicit in a&nbsp;system, passed over into the logical handbooks. Logic falls, according to Ramus, into two parts—invention (treating of the notion&nbsp;and definition) and judgment (comprising the judgment proper,&nbsp;syllogism, and method). This division gave rise to the jocular&nbsp;designation of judgment or mother-wit as the “ secunda Petri. ” He&nbsp;is, perhaps, most suggestive in his emendations of the syllogism.&nbsp;He admits only the first three figures, as in the original Aristotelian&nbsp;scheme, and in his later works he also attacks the validity of the&nbsp;third figure, following in this the precedent of Laurentius Valla.&nbsp;Ramus also set the modern fashion of deducing the figures from&nbsp;the position of the middle term in the premises, instead of basing&nbsp;them, as Aristotle does, upon the different relation of the middle&nbsp;to the so-called major and minor term. On the whole, however,&nbsp;though Ramus may be allowed to have advanced logical study by&nbsp;the wholesome fermentation of thought which he caused, we are</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
