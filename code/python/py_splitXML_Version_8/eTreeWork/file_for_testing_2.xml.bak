    <p>of the kind is to be found. Perhaps the nearest approach to it is a jest at the Sorbonne
        couched in the Pauline phrase about " the evidence of things not seen,” which the author
        removed from the later editions. But irreverences of this kind, as well as the
        frequent burlesque citations of the Bible, whether commendable or not, had been, were, have
        since been, and are common in writers whose orthodoxy is unquestioned; and it must be
        remembered that the later Middle Age, which in many respects Rabelais represents almost more
        than he does the Renaissance, was, with all its unquestioning faith, singularly reckless
        and, to our fancy, irreverent in its use of the sacred words and images, which were to it
        the most familiar of all images and words. On the other hand, there are in the book, in the
        description of Gargantua’s and Pantagruel’s education, in the sketch of the abbey of
        Thelema, in several passages relating to Pantagruel, expressions which either signify a
        sincere and unfeigned piety of a simple kind or else are inventions of the most detestable
        hypocrisy. For these passages are not, like many to be found from the Renaissance to the end
        of the 18th century, obvious flags of truce to cover attacks—mere bowings in the house of
        Rimmon to prevent evil consequences. There is absolutely no sign of the tongue in the cheek.
        They are always written in the author’s highest style, a style perfectly eloquent and
        unaffected; they can only be interpreted (on the free-thinking hypothesis) as allegorical
        with the greatest difficulty and obscurity, and it is pretty certain that no one reading the
        book without a thesis to prove would dream of taking them in a non-natural sense. It is not,
        indeed, to be contended that Rabelais was a man with whom religion was in detail a constant
        thought, that he had a very tender conscience or a very scrupulous orthodoxy. His form
        of religious sentiment was not evangelical or mystical, any more than it was ascetic or
        ceremonial or dogmatic. As regards one of the accepted doctrines of his own church, the
        excellence of the celibate life, of poverty, and of elaborate obedience to a rule, he no
        doubt was a strong dissident; but the evidence that, as a Christian, he was unorthodox, that
        he was even a heretical or latitudinarian thinker in regard to those^ doctrines which the
        various Christian churches have in common, is not merely weak, it is practically
        nonexistent. The counter-testimony is, indeed, not very strong, and still less detailed. But
        that is not the point. It is sufficient to say that there is absolutely nothing within the
        covers of Rabelais's works incompatible with an orthodoxy which would be recognized as
        sufficient by Christendom at large, leaving out of the question those points of doctrine and
        practice on which Christians differ. Beyond this no wise man will go, and short of it hardly
        any unprejudiced man will stop.</p>
    <p>Bibliography.—The dates of the original editions of Rabelais’s works have been given where
        possible already. The earlier books were repeatedly reissued during the author’s life, and
        always with some correction. What may be called the first complete edition appeared in 1567
        at Lyons, published by Jean Martin. It is computed that no less than sixty editions were
        printed before the close of the 16th century. A very considerable time, however,
        elapsed before the works were, properly speaking, edited. Huet devoted much pains to them,
        but his results were not made public. The first edition which calls for notice, except in a
        complete bibliography, is that of Le Duchat (Amsterdam, 1711}. Le Duchat was a very careful
        student, and on the whole a very efficient editor, being perhaps, of the group of students
        of old French at the beginning of the 18th century, which included La Monnoye and others,
        the most sober, critical and accomplished. But at that time the knowledge of the period was
        scarcely far enough advanced. The next important date in the bibliography of Rabelais is
        1823, in which year appeared the most elaborate edition of his work yet published, that of
        Esmangart and Johanneau (9 vols.), including for the first time the Songes Drolattques, a
        spurious but early and not uninteresting collection of grotesque figure drawings
        illustrating Gargantua and Pantagruel, and the second edition of M. de^ l’Aulnaye,
        containing a bad text but a useful glossary. From this time the editions nave been very
        numerous. Among them may be mentioned those illustrated by Gustave Dore, first on a small
        scale (1854), afterwards more elaborately (1870); that of the Collection Didot by Burgaud
        des Marets and Rathery (1857 and later); the Biblioth£que Elz6virienne edition by
        MM.Lacourand A. de Montaiglon; that of the Nouvelle Collection Jannet (seven small volumes,
        1867-74), completed by M. Moland and very useful; and lastly, the edition of M.
        Marty-Laveaux in the Collection Lemerre (1868-1903), the handsomest, the most accurate, and
        the most complete, in the scholarly sense, yet published. Commentaries on Rabelais,
        independent of editions, have been numerous from the work of Jean Bernier, Jugement el
        nouvdles observations sur les ceuvres . .. de M. Francois Rabelais (1697), onwards. Of those
        of the last half-century the best are, besides essays in the works of most of the great
        critics: E. Noel, Rabelais (1850); A. Mayrargues, Rabelais (1868); Jean Fleury (1876); Paul
        Stapfer (the best of all) (1889); and G. Vallat (1899). Separate points have been
        treated importantly by A. Heulhard, Dernilres annSes de Rabelais (1884), and others; while
        the Revue des dudes Rabelaisiennes (1903 onwards) contains valuable studies, especially
        those of M. Abel Leſranc.</p>
    <p>Rabelais was very early popular in England. There are possible I</p>
    <p>allusions to him in Shakespeare, and the current clerical notion of him is very unjustly
        adopted by Marston in the words ” wicked Rabelais”; but Bacon described him better as the
        great jester of France, and a Scot, Sir Thomas Urquhart, translated the earlier books in
        1653. This was not worthily completed till the luckless Motteux, or, as his compatriots call
        him, Le Motteux, finished it with an extensive commentary. It has been frequently
        reprinted. A new translation by W. F. Smith appeared in 1893. Criticism of a scattered kind
        on Rabelais in English is abundant, that of Coleridge being the most important, while the
        constant evidence of his influence in Southey’s Doctor is also noteworthy. But he was hardly
        treated as a whole before Sir Walter Besant’s book on the subject in the ” Foreign Classics
        for English Readers ” (1879), which the author followed up with Readings from Rabelais
        (1883). Somewhat elaborate treatments of him in connexion with contemporary literature will
        be found in George Saintsbury’s The Earlier Renaissance (1901) and in A. Tilley’s Literature
        of the French Renaissance (1904).    (G. Sa.)</p>
    <p>RABENER, GOTTLIEB WILHELM (1714-1771), German satirist, was bom on the 17th of September 1714
        at Wachau near Leipzig, and died at Dresden on tbe 22nd of March 1771. In 1741 he made his
        dtbut as satirist in Schwabe’s Belusligungeu des Verslandes und Wilzes, and was subsequently
        a contributor to the Bremer Beitrdge. Rabener’s satires are in prose and mainly levelled at
        the follies of the middle classes. The papers which he published in the Bremer Beilrdge were
        subsequently collected in a Sammlung salirischer Sckriften (2 vols., 1751), to which two
        volumes were added in 1755.</p>
    <p>Rabener’s Samtliche Werke appeared in 6 vols. in 1777; the edition by E. Ortlepp (1839) also
        contains his correspondence, first published by C. F. Weisse in 1772. See P. Richter,
        Rabener und Li scow (1884), and D. Jacoby in Allg. Deutsche Biographie (1888).</p>
    <p>RABIRIUS, a Latin epic poet of the age of Augustus. Among the papyrus fragments discovered at
        Herculaneum in the early part of the 19th century were sixty-seven (mutilated) hexa-moters,
        referring to the final struggle between Antony and' Octavian and the death of Cleopatra,
        generally supposed to be part of a poem by Rabirius, since Seneca (De Bcnef. vi. 3,
        1) informs us that he wrote on those subjects. If genuine, they justify the qualified
        commendation of Quintilian rather than the exaggerated praise of Velleius Paterculus (ii.
        36, 3), who couples Rabirius and Virgil as the two most eminent poets of his time.</p>

    <p>RABIRIUS, GAIUS, a Roman senator, who was defended (63 b.c.) by Cicero in a speech still
        extant. Nearly forty years after the death of L. Appuleius Saturninus, Titus Labienus (whose
        uncle had lost his life among the followers of Saturninus on that occasion) was put up by
        Caesar to accuse Rabirius of having been implicated in the murder. Caesar’s real object
        was to warn the Senate against interference by force with popular movements, to uphold the
        sovereignty of the people and the inviolability of the person of the tribunes. The obsolete
        accusation of pcrducllio was revived, and the case was heard before Julius and Lucius Caesar
        as commissioners specially appointed (1duoviri pcrducllionis). Rabirius was condemned, and
        the people, to whom the accused had exercised the right of appeal, were on the point of
        ratifying the decision, when A let ell us Celer pulled down the military flag from the
        Janiculum, which was equivalent to the dissolution of the assembly. Caesar’s object having
        been attained, the matter was then allowed to drop.</p>
    <p>A nephew, known as C. Rabirius Postumus, was also defended by Cicero (54 B.C.) in the extant
        speech Pro Rabirio Postumo, when charged with extortion in Egypt and complicity with Aulus
        Gabinius (?.t&gt;.).</p>
