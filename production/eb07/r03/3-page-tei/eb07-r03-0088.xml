Every year the merchants of Tobolsk, Tumene, and the other towns, send boats laden with flour up the Irtysh and the Obe to Berezoff, and the other small towns situated farther to the north ; and these boats return freighted with fish. The clerks and agents belonging to these merchants, and who are established in the small towns upon the banks of the Obe, purchase of the Ostiaks valuable furs, which, together with soap, tallow, and leather, they afterwards export, partly to the fair of Niznei-Novgorod, and partly to the Kirg-hises of the steppes, who pay them in horses, cattle, and cotton stuffs, purchased by themselves of the Bukharians ; the remaining produce of the government of Tobolsk is exported by the way of Kiakhta into China, whence are brought in exchange silks and tea. Kiakhta is the solitary point of commercial intercourse between the two great empires of Russia and China. Almost all the principal houses in Russia have an agent at Kiakhta; while the Chinese traffickers consist chiefly of temporary visiters without their families. The Russians here receive the staples of China, for which they give the productions of their own country in return. The nature and extent of the commerce of</p><p>Kiakhta will be seen from the following statement.</p><lb/><table><row><cell cols="2" rows="1"><p><hi rend="italic">Exportation of Russian Merchandise in</hi>  1835.</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"/><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Roubles.</p><p>...2,229,377</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Leather................................................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>... 742,481</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Linen..................................................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>... 203,115</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Cottons................................................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>... 933,876</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Cloths 718,221 archines...........................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>...1,799,691</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="2" rows="1"><p>Corn, iron, steel, copper, glass, and other articles..1,446,148</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Polish cloths, 206,301 archines...................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Transit merchandises...............................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>... 545,731</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Total.............</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>...7,427,369</p></cell></row></table><lb/><table><row><cell cols="2" rows="1"><p><hi rend="italic">Importation of Chinese Merchandises during the same year.</hi></p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Tea, 199,233 poods, to the amount of........</p><p>Silks................................................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Roubles.</p><p>......6,909,149</p><p>...... 208,599</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Cottons.............................................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>....... 122,726</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Drugs, &amp;c..........................................</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>....... 186,895</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Total..........</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>......7,427,369</p></cell></row><row><cell cols="1" rows="1"><p>Or L.324,947.</p></cell><cell cols="1" rows="1"/></row></table><lb/><p>In 1825 the total exports amounted to 5,501,815 roubles, or L.239,697, so that in ten years there has been an increase in the commercial intercourse between Russia and China to the extent of nearly two millions roubles. The Russians chiefly transport by water the merchandise which they send in summer, or oftener in spring, from Kiakhta to Europe. @@<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p><p>Another great commercial line is that which branches from Irkutsk down the Lena, into the heart of the frozen regions and the shores of the Arctic Ocean. Yakoutsk, situated about eight hundred miles down the Lena, is the emporium where the furs and other products of these desolate regions are collected. They are brought from the remotest extremities of the land which borders Behring’s Straits, from Kamtschatka, and from the American territory, as well as from the northern wastes. A considerable proportion consists of the tribute which is paid to government ; and the wandering traffickers exchange tobacco, spirits, cutlery, beads, and toys, for the remainder.</p><p>Asiatic Russia, like the European portion of the empire,</p><lb/><p>is divided into governments or provinces, which are further partitioned into circles, all being under the same species of civil government which we have described as characterising the rest of the empire.

The population consists of two very distinct portions, the foreign rulers and the native tribes. The Russian inhabitants consist chiefly of the unfortunate persons who have been banished to these remote regions for various crimes, more especially those of a political nature. A basis was formed by the Swedish officers who fell into the hands of Peter the Great on “ sad Pultawa’s day,” and a regular succession of recruits has subsequently been furnished by the empire itself. Amongst those who have been thus expatriated by a jealous and absolute government, were of course many individuals belonging to the higher ranks of society, men of polished manners and accomplished minds, so that at Tobolsk, where they were chiefly stationed, there is a far higher degree of refinement and intelligence to be found than might have been expected in a settlement of convicts. This great capital of Western Siberia has to a considerable extent acquired the polish of a European city. In 1835 it contained 15,379 inhabitants, two ecclesiastical schools, about twenty churches, and a monastery. The lowest class of exiles are condemned to the mines, where, being closely watched, and with hard work and harder fare, they drag out a miserable existence. A class whose offences are of a milder character are distributed amongst the distilleries. A third class receive grants of land, for which a trifle is paid to government. The individuals composing this class are formed into villages, under the superintendence of a strict police. The native races have been enumerated in our general statement of the various tribes who inhabit the Russian empire. Siberia is under the same system of national education as European Russia, and has its schools, gymnasia, and other institutions of the kind. Public instruction is making some progress at Tobolsk, notwithstanding the many obvious difficulties which obstruct it. There are in this government eleven ecclesiastical schools, with thirty-four masters, and 686 pupils.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Transcaucasian Provinces.</hi></p><p>The Transcaucasian territory of Russia is a vast tract of country situated between the Black and Caspian Seas, and bounded by Turkey and Persia on the south. It has been entirely incorporated with the empire since the commencement of this century. Relations had been established with Georgia a long time previously, but it was not till 1801 that it was declared a Russian province. The district of Elizabethpol was seized in 1803; Imeretia in 1805; Persia ceded the Khanats of Sheki, Shirvan, Karabagh, Talish, Bacoo, Cooba, and Derbend, in 1813; the treaty of Turk-manschay, concluded with Persia in 1828, gave to Russia the Armenian provinces of Erivan, Nanhischevan, and Or-dubat, and fixed as its frontier the course of the Araxes; and, lastly, by the treaty of Adrianople Turkey surrendered</p><lb/><p>@@@ Tour in the North of Europe, vol. ii. p. 215.</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
