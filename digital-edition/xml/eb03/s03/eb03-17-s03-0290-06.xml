in mythology, an Egyptian deity, who was worſhipped under various names and attributes, as the tutelary god of Egypt in general, and as the patron of several of their principal cities. Tacitus informs us, that he was worſhipped as a kind of univerſal deity that reprsſented Eſculapius, Oſiris, Jupiter, and Pluto ; and he was ſometimes taken for Jupiter Ammon, the Sun, and Neptune : and the honours that were rendered to<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0297.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0291"/>
him at Alexandria were more solemn and extraordinary than thoſe of any other place.</p><p>Plutarch and Clemens of Alexandria, as well as Tacitus<note anchored="true" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Tae. Hist. 3. iv. cap. Plut. de Iside et Osiride. Clem. Alex. in Protrep.</p></note>, inform us, that while the firſt Ptolemy was employed in fortifying Alexandria with walls, adorning it with temples and ſtately buildings, there appeared to him in his ſleep a young man of extraordinary beauty, of a ſtature more than human, admoniſhing him to dispatch into Pontus ſome of his most truſty friends to bring from thence his ſtatue : he assured him, that the pity and kingdom which posseſſed it ſhould prove happy, glorious, and powerful. The young man having thus ſpoke, diſappeared, mounting up into heaven in a blaze of fire.</p><p>Ptolemy diſcovered his viſion to the priests : but finding them ignorant of Pontus, he had recourſe to an Athenian, who informed him that near Sinope, a city of Pontus, there was a temple much reſorted to by the natives, which was consecrated to Pluto, where he had a ſtatue, near which ſtood that of a woman. Ptolemy, neglecting the injunctions of the apparition, it again appended to him in a menacing attitude ; and the king immediately diſpatched ambaſſadors to the Serapian monarch, loaded with preterits, The king of Sinope consented ; but his ſubjects oppoſed the removal of the statue. The god, however, of his own accord, as we are informed, conveyed himſelf to the ambassador’s ſhip, and in three days landed in Alexandria, The ſtatue of Serapis was erected in one of the ſuburbs of the city, where a magnificent temple was afterwards reared.</p><p>The ſtatue of Serapis, according to Macrobius, was of a human form, with a baſket or buſhel on his head, signifying plenty ; his right hand leaned on the head of a ſerpent, whoſe body was wound round a figure with three heads, of a dog, a lion, and a wolf ; in his left hand he held a measure of a cubit length, as it were to take the height of the waters of the Nile. The figure of Serapis is found on many ancient medals,</p><p>The famous temple of Serapis at Alexandria was destroyed by order of Theodosius ; and the celebrated ſtatue of tins deity was broken in pieces, and its limbs carried firſt in triumph by the Chriſtians through the city, and then thrown into a fierce fire, kindled for that purpose in the amphitheatre. As the Egyptians aſcribed the overflowing of the Nile, to which was owing, the fertility of their country, to the benign influence of their god Serapis, they concluded, that now he was destroyed, the river would no longer overflow, and that a general famine would ensue ; but when they obſerved, on the contrary, that the Nile ſwelled to a greater height than had been known in the memory of man, and thereby produced an immenſe plenty of all kinds of proviſions, many of the pagans renouncing the worſhip of idols, adored the God of the Chriſtians.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
