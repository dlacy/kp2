For a short time in 1885-86 he&nbsp;sat in the Chamber of Deputies, but found a great opportunity&nbsp;next year for his talent for inflaming public opinion in the&nbsp;Boulangist agitation. He was condemned to detention in a&nbsp;fortress in August 1889 at the same time as General Boulanger,&nbsp;whom he had followed into exile. He continued his polemic&nbsp;from London, and after the suicide of General Boulanger he&nbsp;attacked M. Constans, minister of the interior in the Freycinet&nbsp;cabinet, with the utmost violence, in a series of articles which&nbsp;led to an interpellation in the chamber in circumstances of&nbsp;wild excitement and disorder. The Panama scandals furnished him with another occasion, and he created something&nbsp;of a sensation by a statement in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Figaro</span><span class="font1"> that he had met&nbsp;M.

<p><span class="font1">ROCHEFORT, a small town of Belgium, situated on the Lomme, a tributary of the Lesse, in the S.E. of the province&nbsp;of Namur close to the Ardennes. ' Resident pop. (1904) 3068,&nbsp;which in July and August is doubled. It is of ancient origin,&nbsp;its position at the point where the route to St Hubert crossed&nbsp;that from Lidge to Bouillon having made it at all times a place&nbsp;of some importance. The ruins of the old castle, which gave&nbsp;the place its name and a title to a long line of counts who had&nbsp;the right of coining their own money, still exist. This castle&nbsp;underwent many sieges and suffered much in the earlier wars,&nbsp;especially at the hands of Marshal de Chatillon<sup>1</sup> in 1636. Rochefort is noted for its healthiness, and is a favourite place of&nbsp;residence. It also attracts every summer a large number of&nbsp;visitors and tourists, who visit it on account of the remarkable&nbsp;grottoes in its neighbourhood. One of these is situated in&nbsp;the town itself and is known by its name. This grotto contains&nbsp;six halls or chambers, the largest of which is called the Sabbat,&nbsp;and is remarkable for its great height. But the most famous&nbsp;are the grottoes of Han, situated three miles from Rochefort&nbsp;at Han sur Lesse. Here the river Lesse passes by a subterranean&nbsp;and undiscovered passage under the hill called Boeme or Boine.&nbsp;The endeavour to trace the course of the river led to the discovery of the grottoes, which consist of fifteen separate halls,&nbsp;connected by passages more or less short and emerging on the&nbsp;river in a dark and extensive cavern forming </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">sort of side&nbsp;creek or bay. Except in flood-time, when the exit has to be&nbsp;used, the entrance is near the-point where the river disappears&nbsp;at what is called the gap or hole of Belvaux, and the exit is&nbsp;made by boat from the cavern last described, which leads out&nbsp;to the open river. A beautiful effect is afforded by the passage&nbsp;from the complete darkness of this cavern into the light. The&nbsp;finest stalactites are in the three halls called the Mystérieuses,&nbsp;the Vigneron and the Draperies. · In the last-named is “ the&nbsp;tomb,” which looks as if chiselled out of white marble. The&nbsp;central hall—called the Salle d’Armes—is immense, and one&nbsp;of the river channels flows through it. Electric light has been&nbsp;introduced. Near Rochefort are the famous red marble quarries&nbsp;of St Remy, and the old Cistcrcian abbey of that name is now&nbsp;a Trappist seminary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCHEFORT, a town of western France, capital of an arrondissement in the department of Charente-Inférieure, 20 m. S.S.E. of La Rochelle on the State railway from Nantes to&nbsp;Bordeaux. Pop. (1906) town, 31,433; commune, 36,694. It&nbsp;is situated on the right bank of the Charente, 9 m. from the&nbsp;Atlantic, and is built partly on the side of a rocky hill and&nbsp;partly on an old marshland. The town is laid out with great&nbsp;regularity, the streets being wide and straight and centring&nbsp;round the Place Colbert, in the middle of which is a monumental&nbsp;fountain of the 18th century. The public institutions of&nbsp;Rochefort comprise the sub-prefecture, tribunals of first instance&nbsp;and of commerce, a board of trade arbitration, a chamber of&nbsp;commerce, a lycée for boys, a college for girls and schools of&nbsp;drawing and architecture. The fortifications are slight. Below&nbsp;Rochefort the Charente is crossed by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pont transbordeur,</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;carrier of which is suspended at a height which admits of the&nbsp;tallest ships passing underneath at any time. There are both&nbsp;a naval and a commercial harbour. The former has the advantage of deep anchorage well protected by batteries at the&nbsp;mouth of the river, and the roadstead is perfectly safe. The&nbsp;windings of the channel, however, between Rochefort and the&nbsp;sea, and the bar at the entrance render navigation dangerous.&nbsp;Rochefort is capital of the fourth maritime arrondissement, which&nbsp;stretches from the bay of Bourgneuf to the coast of Spain.&nbsp;The naval harbour and arsenal, separated from the town by a&nbsp;line of fortifications with three gates, contain large covered&nbsp;building yards, repairing docks and extensive timber basins&nbsp;on both banks of the river. The arsenal has also a ropewalk&nbsp;dating from 1668, a school of navigation and pilotage, the&nbsp;offices of the maritime prefecture, the navy commissariat, a&nbsp;park of · artillery and various boards of direction connected&nbsp;with the navy. Other government establishments at Rochefort&nbsp;are barracks for infantry, artillery and marines, and the naval&nbsp;hospital and school of medicine. In the grounds of this last&nbsp;institution is an artesian well, sunk in 1862-1866 to a depth of&nbsp;2800 ft., and yielding water with a temperature of 100° F.&nbsp;The commercial harbour, higher up the river than the naval&nbsp;harbour, has two small basins, a third basin with an area of&nbsp;15 acres and a depth at neap-tide of 25 ft., at spring-tide </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">29I ft., and a dry dock no yds. long. Besidesshipbuilding,&nbsp;which forms the staple industry, flour- and saw-milling, sailcloth, &amp;c., are among the local manufactures. At the ports&nbsp;of Rochefort and Tonnay-Charente (4 m. higher up) there&nbsp;entered, in 1905, 265 vessels (166 British), with a tonnage of&nbsp;192,537·</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The lordship of Rochefort, held by powerful nobles as early as the nth century, was united to the French Crown by Philip&nbsp;the Fair early in the 14th century; but it was alternately&nbsp;seized in the course of the Hundred Years’ War by the EngUsh&nbsp;and the French, and in the Wars of Religion by the Catholics&nbsp;and Protestants. Colbert having in 1665 chosen Rochefort as&nbsp;the seat of a repairing port between Brest and the Gironde,&nbsp;the town rapidly increased in importance; by 1674 it had&nbsp;20,000 inhabitants; and when the Dutch admiral Cornelius&nbsp;Tromp appeared at the mouth of the river with seventy-two&nbsp;vessels for the purpose of destroying the new arsenal, he found&nbsp;the approaches so well defended that he gave up his enterprise.&nbsp;It was at Rochefort that the naval school, afterwards transferred to Brest, was originally founded. The town continued to&nbsp;flourish in the later part of the 17th century. In 1690 and in&nbsp;1703 the English made unsuccessful attempts to destroy it.&nbsp;Its fleet, under the command of Admiral la Gallissonnière, a&nbsp;native of the place, defeated Admiral Byng in 1755 and did&nbsp;good service in the wars of the repubUc. But the destruction&nbsp;of the French fleet by the English in 1809 in the roadstead of&nbsp;île d’Aix, the preference accorded to the harlïours of Brest&nbsp;and Toulon and the unhealthiness of its climate seriously interfered with the prosperity of the place. The convict establishment, founded at Rochcfort in 1777, was suppressed in 1852.</span></p>
