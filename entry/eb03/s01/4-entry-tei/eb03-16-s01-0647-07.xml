or <hi rend="smallcaps">Sanpoo,</hi> the vulgar name of one of the moſt mighty rivers in the world. The name it generally goes by, and by which it is beſt known, is that of <hi rend="italic">Burrampoοter.</hi> Of this moſt majeſtic body of waters we have the following very animated account in <hi rend="italic">Maurice’s Indian Antiquities.</hi> “An object equally novel and grand now claims our attention; ſo novel, as not to have been known to Europeans in the real extent of its magnificence before the year 1765, and ſo awfully grand, that the aſtoniſhed geographer, thinking the language of proſe inadequate to convey his conception,<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0654.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0648"/>
has had recourſe to the more expreſſive and energetic language of poetry: but</p><p>Scarce the Muſe herſelſ</p><p>Dares ſtretch her wing o’er this enormous maſs</p><p>Of ruſhing waters; to whoſe dread expanſe,</p><p>Continuous depth, and wond'rous length of courſe,</p><p>Our floods are rills.</p><p>"This ſtupendous object is the Burrampooter, a word which in Shanſcrit ſigniſies <hi rend="italic">the ſon of Brahma;</hi> for no meaner origin could be aſſigned to ſo wonderful a progeny. This ſupreme monarch of Indian rivers derives its ſource from the oppoſite ſide of the ſame mountain from which the Ganges ſprings, and taking a bold ſweep towards the eaſt, in a line directly oppoſite to the courſe of that river, waſhes the vaſt country of Tibet, where, by way of diſtinction, it is denominated <hi rend="italic">Sanpoo,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">the river.</hi> Winding with a rapid current through Tibet, and, for many a league, amidſt dreary deſerts and regions remote from the habitations of men, it waters the borders of the territory of Laſſa, the reſidence of the grand Lama; and then deviating with a cometary irregularity, from an eaſt to a ſouth-eaſt courſe, the <hi rend="italic">mighty wanderer</hi> approaches within 2OO miles of the weitem frontiers of the vaſt empire of China. From this point its more direct path to the ocean lay through the gulph of Siam; but with a deſultory courſe peculiar to itſelf, it ſuddenly turns to the weſt through Affam, and enters Bengal on the north-eaſt quarter. “Circling round the weſtern point of the Garrow mountains, the Burrampooter now takes a ſouthern direction; and for 6o miles before it meets the Ganges, its ſiſter in point of origin, but not its rival in point of magnitude, glides majeſtically along in a ſtream which is regularly from four to five miles wide, and but for its freſhneſs, Mr Rennel ſays, might paſs for an arm of the ſea. About 40 miles from the ocean theſe mighty rivers unite their ſtreams; but that gentleman is of opinion that their junction was formerly higher up, and that the accumulation of two ſuch vaſt bodies of water, ſcooped out the amazing bed of the Megna lake. Their preſent conflux is below Luckipoor; and by that confluence a body of freſh running water is produced, hardly equalled, and not exceeded, either in the old or the new hemiſphere. So ſtupendous is that body of water, that it has formed a gulph of ſuch extent as to contain iſlands that rival our Iſle of Wight in ſize and fertility; and with ſuch reſiſtleſs violence does it ruſh into the ocean, that in the rainy ſeaſon the ſea itſelf, or at leaſt its ſurface, is perfectly freſh for many leagues out. ”</p></div></body></text></TEI>
