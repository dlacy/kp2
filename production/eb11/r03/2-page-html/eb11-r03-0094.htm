<p><span class="font0">reception. Consequently, it is possible to exclude the tide by injudicious works, such as the sluices which were erected long&nbsp;ago across the fen rivers to secure the low-lying lands from the&nbsp;inroads of the sea; the tidal influx is also liable to be reduced&nbsp;by accretion in an estuary resulting from training works. The&nbsp;great aim, on the contrary, of all tidal river improvement&nbsp;should be to facilitate to the utmost the flow of the flood-tide&nbsp;up a river, to remove all obstructions from the channel so as&nbsp;to render the scouring efficiency of the flood and ebb tides as&nbsp;great as possible, and by making the tidal flow extend as far up&nbsp;the river as possible to reduce to a minimum the period of&nbsp;slack tide when deposit takes place.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tidal Flow in a River.—</span><span class="font0">The progress of the flood-tide up a river and the corresponding ebb are very clearly shown by a diagram&nbsp;giv ing a series of simultaneous tidal lines obtained from simultaneous&nbsp;observations of the height of the river Hugli during a high spring-tide in the dry season, taken at intervals at several stations along&nbsp;the river, and exhibiting on a very distorted scale the actual water-level of the river at these periods (fig. 16). The steep form assumed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">by the foremost part of the flood-tide lines from the entrance to beyond Chinsura, attaining a maximum in the neighbourhood of&nbsp;Konnagar and Chinsura, indicates the existence of a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bore,</span><span class="font0"> caused&nbsp;by the sand-banks in the channel obstructing the advance of the&nbsp;flood-tide, till it has risen sufficiently in height to rush up the river&nbsp;as a steep, breaking wave, overcoming all obstacles and producing&nbsp;a sudden reversal of the flow and abrupt rise of the water-level,&nbsp;as observed on the Severn, the Seine, the Amazon and other rivers.&nbsp;A bore indicates defects in the tidal condition and the navigable&nbsp;channel, which can only be reduced by lowering the obstructions&nbsp;and by the regulation of the river. No tidal river of even moderate&nbsp;length is ever completely filled by tidal water; for the tide begins&nbsp;to fall at its mouth before the flood-tide has produced high water&nbsp;at the tidal limit, as most clearly shown in the case of a long tidal&nbsp;river by the Hugli tidal diagram. Every improvement of the&nbsp;channel, however, expedites and increases the, filling of the river,&nbsp;whilst the volume of water admitted at each tide is further augmented&nbsp;by the additional capacity provided by the greater efflux of the&nbsp;ebb, as indicated by the lowering of the low-water line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deepening Tidal Rivers by Dredging.—</span><span class="font0">The improvement of tidal rivers mainly by dredging is specially applicable to small rivers&nbsp;which possess a sufficient navigable width, like the Clyde and the&nbsp;Tyne ; for such rivers can be considerably deepened by an amount&nbsp;of dredging which would be quite inadequate for producing a similar&nbsp;increase in depth in a large, wide river, with shifting channels.&nbsp;Both the Clyde below Glasgow and the Tyne below Newcastle were&nbsp;originally insignificant rivers, almost dry in places at low water of&nbsp;spring-tides; and the earliest works on both rivers consisted mainly&nbsp;in regulating their flow and increasing their scour by jetties and&nbsp;training works. They have, however, been brought to their present&nbsp;excellent navigable condition almost wholly, since 1840 on the Clyde&nbsp;and 1861 on the Tyne, by continuous systematic dredging, rendered&nbsp;financially practicable by the growing importance of their sea-going&nbsp;traffic. The Clyde has been given a minimum depth of about&nbsp;22 ft. at low water of spring-tides up to Glasgow, and can admit&nbsp;vessels of 27 to 28 ft. draught. In the Tyne (figs. 17 and 18), it&nbsp;was decided in 1902 to provide a minimum dredging depth in the&nbsp;river channel at low water of 25 ft. from the sea to the docks, of&nbsp;20 ft. thence to Newcastle and of 18 ft. up to Scotswood, the rise&nbsp;of spring-tides increasing these depths by 15 ft. In 1906 it was&nbsp;determined to make the channel 30 ft. deep at low water of spring-tides from the sea to the docks, and in 1908 to deepen it between&nbsp;the docks and Newcastle swing bridge from 20 to 25 ft., and also&nbsp;between the swing bridge and Derwenthaugh from 18 to 25 ft.&nbsp;The natural scour of these rivers has been so much reduced by such&nbsp;an exceptional enlargement of their channels that a considerable&nbsp;amount of dredging will always be required to preserve the depth&nbsp;attained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Regulation and Dredging of Tidal Rivers.—</span><span class="font0">Considerable improvements in the navigable condition of tidal rivers above their outlet or estuary can often be effected by regulation works aided by dredging, which ease sharp bends, straighten their course and render</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">their channel, depth and flow more uniform. Examples are the Nervion between Bilbao and its mouth (figs. 19 and 20), and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Weser from Bremen to Bremerhaven at the head of its estuary (figs. 21 and 22). These works resemble in principle the regulation&nbsp;works on large rivers with only a fresh-water discharge, previously&nbsp;described; but on tidal rivêrs the main low-water channel should&nbsp;alone be trained with an enlarging width seawards to facilitate&nbsp;the tidal influx, and the tidal capacity of the river above low water&nbsp;should be maintained unimpaired..</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To secure a good and fairly uniform depth on a tidal river, it is essential that the flood and ebb tides should follow the same course,&nbsp;in order to combine their scouring efficiency, and form a single,&nbsp;continuous deep channel. In wide, winding reaches, however, the&nbsp;flood tide in ascending a river follows,as direct, a course as,practicable; and on reaching a bend, the main flood-tide current, in being&nbsp;deflected from its straight course, hugs the concave bank, and,&nbsp;keeping close alongside the same bank beyond the bend, cuts into&nbsp;the shoal projecting from the convex bend of the bank higher up,&nbsp;forming a blind shoaling channel, as clearly indicated near the&nbsp;Moyapnr Magazine in fig. 23, and a little below Shipgunj Point in&nbsp;fig. 24. This effect is due to the flood-tide losing its guidance, and&nbsp;consequently its concentration, at the change of curvature beyond&nbsp;the termination of the concave bank, where it spreads out and&nbsp;passes gradually over, in its direct course, to the next concave bend&nbsp;above along the opposite bank. The ebb tide, on the contrary,&nbsp;descending the river, follows the general course of the fresh-water&nbsp;discharge in all rivers, its main current in the Moyapur reach keeping&nbsp;close along the concave bank between Ulabana and Hiragunj&nbsp;Point, and crossing over opposite the point to the next concave&nbsp;bank below (fig. 23); whilst in the James and Mary reach the&nbsp;main ebb-tide current runs alongside the concave bank in front&nbsp;of Ninan and Nurpur, and crosses over near Hugli Point to the&nbsp;opposite concave bank below Gewankhali (fig. 24). The main&nbsp;currents, accordingly, of the flood and ebb tides in such reaches&nbsp;act quite independently between the bends, forming channels on&nbsp;opposite sides of the river and leaving a central intervening shoal.&nbsp;The surveys of the two reaches of the Hugh, represented in figs. 23&nbsp;and 24, having been taken in the dry season, exhibit the flood-tide&nbsp;channels at their deepest phase,, and the ebb-tide channels in their&nbsp;worst and least continuous condition.</span></p>
