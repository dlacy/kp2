<p><span class="font0">Rowlandson’s designs were usually executed in outline with the reed-pen, and delicately washed with colour. They were then&nbsp;etched by the artist on the copper, and afterwards aqua-tinted—&nbsp;usually by a professional engraver, the impressions being finally&nbsp;coloured by hand. As a designer he was characterized by the&nbsp;utmost facility and ease of draughtsmanship, and the quality of&nbsp;his art suffered from this haste and over-production. He was a&nbsp;true if not a very refined humorist, dealing less frequently than, his&nbsp;fierce contemporary Gillray with politics, but commonly touching,&nbsp;in a rather gentle spirit, the various aspects and incidents of social&nbsp;life. His most artistic work is to be found among the more careful&nbsp;drawings of his earlier period; but even among the exaggerated&nbsp;caricature of his later time we find hints that this master of the&nbsp;humorous might have attained to the beautiful had he so willed.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROWLEY, WILLIAM </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font0"> 1585-c. 1642), English actor and dramatist, collaborator with several of the dramatists of the&nbsp;Elizabethan period, especially with Thomas Middleton. He&nbsp;is not to be identified with “ Master Rowley, once a rare scholar&nbsp;of learned Pembroke Hall in Cambridge,” whom Francis Meres&nbsp;described in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Palladis Tamia</span><span class="font0"> as one of the “ best for comedy.”&nbsp;The only Rowley at Pembroke Hall at the period was Ralph&nbsp;Rowley, afterwards rector of Chelmsford. William Rowley&nbsp;is described as the chief comedian in the Prince of Wales’s&nbsp;company, and it was doubtless during the two years’ union&nbsp;(1614-16) of these players with the Lady Elizabeth’s company that he was brought into contact with Middleton. Rowley&nbsp;joined the King’s Servants in 1623, and retired from the stage&nbsp;about four years later. The fact of his marriage is recorded&nbsp;in 1637, and he is supposed to have died about 1642. Four&nbsp;plays attributed to his sole authorship are extant: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A new&nbsp;Wonder, A Woman never Vexl</span><span class="font0"> (printed, 1632); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Match at&nbsp;Midnight</span><span class="font0"> (1633); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Tragedie called Alls Lost by Lust</span><span class="font0"> (1633);&nbsp;and a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Shoomaker a Gentleman with the Life and Death of the&nbsp;Cripple that slole the Weathercock at Paules</span><span class="font0"> (1638). They are&nbsp;distinguished by effectiveness of situation and ingenuity of&nbsp;plot, so that we may conjecture why he was in such request&nbsp;as an associate in play-making, and he had further an experimental knowledge of the coarse comedy likely to please the pit.&nbsp;It is recorded by Langbaine that he “ was beloved of those&nbsp;great men Shakespeare, Fletcher and Jonson.” The plays he&nbsp;wrote with Middleton are dealt with under that heading. With&nbsp;George Wilkins and John Day he wrote </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Travailes of the&nbsp;Three English Brothers</span><span class="font0"> (1607); with Thomas Heywood he&nbsp;produced the romantic comedy of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fortune by Land and Sea&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(printed, 1655); he was associated with Thomas Dekker and&nbsp;John Ford in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Witch of Edmonton@@</span><span class="font0"><sup>1</sup> (printed, 1658); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A&nbsp;Cure for a Cuckold</span><span class="font0"> (printed, 1661) and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Thracian Wonder&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(printed, i66r) are assigned to the joint authorship of Webster&nbsp;and Rowley; while Shakespeare’s name was unjustifiably&nbsp;coupled with his on the title-page of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Birth of Merlin: or,&nbsp;The Childe hath found his Father (1662).</span><span class="font0"> Rowley also wrote&nbsp;an elegy on Hugh Attwell, the actor, and a satirical pamphlet&nbsp;describing contemporary London, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A Search for Money&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">(1609).</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">by Henslowe as a reader of plays. He wrote some scriptural plays now lost, with William Borne (or Bird, or Boyle)@@<sup>2</sup> and Edward&nbsp;Juby.

Or, A Contract Broken,&nbsp;justly reveng'd</span><span class="font0"> (1634), which was entered, however,in the Stationers*&nbsp;Register as the work of Thomas Dekker, to whom the major share&nbsp;is probably assignable.</span></p>

The town is a modern growth out of a village&nbsp;surrounding the church of St Giles, which dates from the&nbsp;13th century, though rebuilt in 1840.

The simplest form of rowlock is a notch, square&nbsp;or rounded, on the gunwale, in which the oar rests; other&nbsp;kinds are formed by two pins or pegs, “ thole pins ” (thole&nbsp;being ultimately the same word as Norw. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">toll,</span><span class="font0"> a young fir-tree),&nbsp;and by a swivel with two horns of metals, pivoted in the gunwale or on an outrigger (see Oar).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROWTON, MONTAGUE WILLIAM LOWRY-CORRY, Baron (1838-1903), second son of the Right Hon. Henry Corry by&nbsp;his wife Harriet, daughter of the 6th earl of Shaftesbury, was&nbsp;born in London on the 8th of October 1838, educated at&nbsp;Harrow and at Trinity College, Cambridge, and called to the&nbsp;bar in 1863. His father, a son of the 2nd earl of Belmore, represented County Tyrone in parliament continuously for forty-seven years (1826-73), and was a member of Lord Derby’s&nbsp;cabinet (r 866-68) as vice-president of the council and afterwards as first lord of the Admiralty. Montague Corry was&nbsp;thus brought up in close touch with Conservative party politics;&nbsp;but it is said to have been his winning personality and social&nbsp;accomplishments rather than his political connexions that&nbsp;recommended him to the favourable notice of Disraeli, who&nbsp;in 1866 made Corry his private secretary. From this time&nbsp;till the statesman’s death in 1881 Corry maintained his connexion with Disraeli, the relations between the two men being&nbsp;more intimate and confidential than usually subsist between&nbsp;a private secretary and his political chief. When Disraeli&nbsp;resigned office in 1868 Corry declined various offers of public&nbsp;employment in order to be free to continue his services, now&nbsp;given gratuitously, to the Conservative leader; and when the&nbsp;latter returned to power in 1874, Corry resumed his position as&nbsp;official private secretary to the prime minister. He accompanied Disraeli (then earl of Beaconsfield) to the congress of&nbsp;Berlin in 1878, where he acted as one of the secretaries of the&nbsp;special embassy of Great Britain. On the defeat of the Conservatives in 1880, Corry was raised to the peerage with the&nbsp;title of Baron Rowton, of Rowton Castle, Shropshire. He&nbsp;had rendered service of an exceptional order to his chief, and&nbsp;after Beaconsfield’s removal to the House of Lords his private&nbsp;secretary became invaluable in keeping him in touch with the&nbsp;rank and file of his party. Lord Rowton was in Algiers when&nbsp;Beaconsfield was stricken with his last illness in the spring&nbsp;of 1881; but returning post-haste across Europe, he was present&nbsp;at the death-bed of his old chief. Beaconsfield </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.}</span><span class="font0"> bequeathed&nbsp;to Rowton all his correspondence and other papers.</span></p>
