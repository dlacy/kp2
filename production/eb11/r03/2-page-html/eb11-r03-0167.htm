<p><span class="font1">The hutîa </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Capromys pilorides)</span><span class="font1"> is nearly as large, arboreal in habits, and a native of Cuba, where it is the largest indigenous mammal.&nbsp;Other species occur in Cuba, Jamaica and the Bahamas, while a&nbsp;Venezuelan species, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Procapromys geayi,</span><span class="font1"> represents a separate genus.&nbsp;In one kind the tail is prehensile. All these rodents are remarkable&nbsp;for the manner in which the liver is divided into minute lobules.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plagiodontia aedium,</span><span class="font1"> another member of the group, is peculiar to&nbsp;Hayti. The. African cane-rats, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Thryonomys</span><span class="font1"> (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aulacodus),</span><span class="font1"> are&nbsp;large terrestrial rodents, ranging from the centre of the continent&nbsp;to the Cape, easily recognized by their deeply fluted incisors (see&nbsp;Coypu). The Octodontidae, which are exclusively South American,&nbsp;differ from the preceding, family by the tympanic bulla being&nbsp;filled with cellular bony tissue, and by the par-occipital process&nbsp;curving beneath it, while the cheek-teeth arc almost or completely rootless and composed of parallel plates. The first front&nbsp;toe may be absent. The more typical members of the family are&nbsp;rat-like burrowing rodents, living in communities. The typical&nbsp;genus is represented by the degu </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Octodcn degus)</span><span class="font1"> and several&nbsp;nearly related species; other genera being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ctenomys<sub>i</sub> Octodontomys&nbsp;(Neoctodon)<sub>i</sub> Aconaernys<sub>i</sub> Spalacopns</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abrocoma</span><span class="font1"> the latter&nbsp;taking its name from its unusually soft fur. Among these, the&nbsp;tuco-tucos </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ctenomys)</span><span class="font1"> are characterized by their burrowing habits,&nbsp;almost rudimentary ears, small eyes, short tails and the kidneyshaped grinding-surfaces of their cheek-teeth. They take their&nbsp;name of tuco-tuco from their cry, which resembles the blows&nbsp;of a hammer on an anvil, and may be heard all day as the little&nbsp;rodents move, in their burrows, generally formed in sandy soil.&nbsp;In some districts the ground is undermined by these burrows, in&nbsp;which stores of food are accumulated. The species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Octodon&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">have larger ears, longer, tufted tails and the sides of the cheekteeth indented by plates of enamel; they are chiefly found in&nbsp;hedgerows and bushes, where they burrow. In </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abrocoma</span><span class="font1"> the tail has&nbsp;no tuft, the ears are still larger and the lower cheek-teeth more&nbsp;complex than the upper ones. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Aconaemys</span><span class="font1"> is an allied Chilean genus&nbsp;in which the enamel-folds meet across the molars. Several of&nbsp;these rodents live in the Andes, where the ground is. covered for&nbsp;months with snow. The second group of the family is formed by&nbsp;the genera </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Loncheres<sub>i</sub> Dactylomys<sub>i</sub> Echilnolrnys<sub>i</sub> Proechimys</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;a few others, the members of which are rat-like rodents, with long&nbsp;scaly or furry tails, and frequently flattened spines mingled with the&nbsp;fur of the back. Most species are brown above and whitish beneath,&nbsp;but in some the lighter tints extend on to the sides, shoulders and&nbsp;head, communicating a coloration somewhat like that of a guinea-pig&nbsp;(see Octodon). The North African gundis </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ctenodactylus gundi&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ct. vali)</span><span class="font1"> are the types of an African family, which also includes&nbsp;the genera </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Massoutiera<sub>i</sub> Pectinator</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petromys.</span><span class="font1"> In the gundi&nbsp;the two inner toes of the hind-foot are furnished with a horny comb&nbsp;and bristles for the purpose of cleaning the fur, and the tail is very&nbsp;short ; but in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pectinator</span><span class="font1"> the tail is longer. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petromys</span><span class="font1"> has a still longer&nbsp;and more bushy tail, and no comb to the hind-feet. . The gundi is a&nbsp;diurnal species, inhabiting rocky districts, and having habits very&nbsp;similar to those of a jerboa. Of these </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ctenodactylus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pectinator&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">are characterized by the union of the incus and malleus of the&nbsp;internal ear, the free fibula and the almost rootless cheek-teeth.&nbsp;The premolar is very small, thus showing an approximation to&nbsp;the Myoidea, although in other respects </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Petrornys</span><span class="font1"> appears to approximate to the Hystricidae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Picas and Hares.—</span><span class="font1">The remaining rodents, which include two families—the picas (Ochotonidae) and the hares and. rabbits&nbsp;(Leporidae)—constitute a second sub-order, the Duplicidentata,&nbsp;differing from all the foregoing groups in possessing two pairs of&nbsp;incisors in the upper jaw (of which the second is small, and placed&nbsp;directly behind the large first pair), the enamel of which extends&nbsp;round to their postericr surfaces. At birth there are three pairs of&nbsp;incisors, but the outer one is soon lost. The incisive foramina are&nbsp;large and usually confluent; the bony palate is very narrow from&nbsp;before backwards; there is no alisphenoid canal; the fibula is&nbsp;welded to the tibia, and articulates with the calcanéum; and&nbsp;the testes are permanently external. All are terrestrial, and in&nbsp;many cases burrowing, in their, habits, and some of them are of&nbsp;extreme fleetness. The Ochotonidae are represented at the present&nbsp;day only by the single genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ochotona (Lagomys)<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> which includes&nbsp;all the picas, or mouse-hares. They are small rodents with complete clavicles, fore- and hind-limbs of nearly equal length, no&nbsp;external tails and short ears. Skull depressed, frontals contracted&nbsp;and without post-orbital processes; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">p.</span><span class="font1"> } or j; molars rootless,&nbsp;with transverse enamel-folds, ln some cases the molar-formula&nbsp;is j. The genus includes about a score of species of guinea-pig-like&nbsp;animals, inhabiting chiefly the mountainous parts of Northern&nbsp;Asia (from 11,000 to 14,000 ft.), one species only being known&nbsp;from South-east Europe and several from the Rocky Mountains&nbsp;and Alaska.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">From the picas the hares and rabbits (Leporidae) are distinguished by the imperfect clavicles, the more or less elongated hina-limbs,&nbsp;short recurved tail (absent in one case) and generally long ears.&nbsp;The skull is compressed, with large wing-shaped post-orbital</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">f</span><span class="font1">&gt;rocesses (fig. 16); </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">p. §. </span><span class="font1">With the exception of Australasia, the amily has a cosmopolitan distribution; and its numerous species&nbsp;resemble one another more or less closely in general external&nbsp;characters. In all the fore-limbs have five and the hind four&nbsp;digits; and the soles of the feet are densely clothed with hairs&nbsp;similar to those</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">covering the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">legs; the inner</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">surface of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">checks being</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">hairy. Although the family has&nbsp;such a wide distribution, the&nbsp;greater number&nbsp;of the species&nbsp;are restricted to&nbsp;Europe, northern and central Asia and&nbsp;North America ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">South America having very few.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Till within the last few years&nbsp;the majority of&nbsp;naturalists followed the practice of including</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">all the members of the family in the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus.</span><span class="font1"> It is true that Mr E. Blyth long ago. proposed the name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caprolagus&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">for the remarkable spiny rabbit 01 the western Himalayas,&nbsp;while the generic name </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oryctolagus</span><span class="font1"> was suggested later for the&nbsp;rabbit, and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sylvilagus</span><span class="font1"> for the American “ cotton-tails ” ; but&nbsp;none of these was accorded general acceptation. Of late years,&nbsp;however, zoologists have come to the conclusion that generic subdivisions of the Leporidae are advisable. In 1899 Dr Fcrsyth&nbsp;Major proposed a classification of the family in which a number&nbsp;of species were grouped with the spiny rabbit in the genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Capro-Iagus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> whilst </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oryctolagus</span><span class="font1"> was taken to include not only the common&nbsp;rabbit, but likewise the Cape hare. A more recent classification&nbsp;is that of Mr M. W. Lyon, in which by far the largest number of&nbsp;species of the family are retained in the original genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> which&nbsp;has also the widest geographical distribution of all the genera. It&nbsp;is typified by the blue hare </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Lepus timidus),</span><span class="font1"> next to which comes&nbsp;the common hare </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(L. europaeus)</span><span class="font1"> and certain other allied forms.&nbsp;The jackass-hares of Mexico, &amp;c., such as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">L. Californicus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> fcrm a&nbsp;second sub-group ; while these are in turn followed by the American&nbsp;hare </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(L. americanus)</span><span class="font1"> and its immediate relatives. The cottontails, or w<sup>T</sup>ood-rabbits, of North and South America are regarded as&nbsp;forming a genus, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sylvilagus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> by themselves, which includes the&nbsp;Brazilian and Paraguay hares, and appears to be chiefly distinguished by a certain feature in the parietal region of the skull.&nbsp;Under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oryctolagus Cuniculus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> the rabbit is considered&nbsp;to represent a genus by itself, specially characterized by the shortness of the ears and hind-feet. The swamp-rabbit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(L. palustris)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">and water-hare </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(L. aquaticus)</span><span class="font1"> of. the southern United States form&nbsp;the group </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Limnotragus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> characterized by the harsher fur, the shorter&nbsp;ears, tail and hind-feet, and the complete fusion of the post-orbital&nbsp;process (which is so distinct in the typical hares) with the adjacent&nbsp;parts of the skull, so that neither notches nor. perforations are&nbsp;developed in this region. The short-tailed rabbit of the western&nbsp;United States </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Brachylagus idahoensis)</span><span class="font1"> is the sole member of a&nbsp;group allied in general characters to the typical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> but distinguished by the unusually short tail. Another group is </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Prono-Iagus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> typified by. the. Cape thick-tailed hare, the so-called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus&nbsp;Crassicaudatus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> which is externally similar to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lcpus</span><span class="font1"> proper, but has&nbsp;the skull and teeth of the general t&gt; pe of the next group. The tailless rabbit of Mount Popocatepetl, Mexico, originally described as&nbsp;a distinct generic type, under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romerolagus Uelsoni<sub>i&nbsp;</sub></span><span class="font1">is broadly distinguished by the entire absence of the tail, and the&nbsp;short ears and hind-feet, its general fcrm being like that of the&nbsp;Liu-Kiu rabbit, while, as in the latter, the post-orbital process of&nbsp;the skull is small, and represented only by the hinder half. Next&nbsp;come three remarkable rabbits from the Indo-Malay countries,&nbsp;all closely allied, although regarded as representing three generic&nbsp;groups, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Nesolagus<sub>i</sub> Caprolagus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pentalagus.</span><span class="font1"> In all three the&nbsp;skull is of the type 01 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Romerolagus.</span><span class="font1"> The first is represented by&nbsp;the Sumatran rabbit, the so-called JV. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">netscheri,</span><span class="font1"> whicn apparently&nbsp;differs from the spiny rabbit mainly by the pattern of the cheekteeth. The spiny rabbit, separated from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus</span><span class="font1"> by Blyth in 1845&nbsp;under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Caprolagus hispidus,</span><span class="font1"> is an inhabitant of Assam&nbsp;and the adjacent districts, and distinguished by its.harsh, bristly&nbsp;fur and short ears and tail. In the Liu-Kiu rabbit </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Pentalagus&nbsp;furnessi)</span><span class="font1"> the coat is equally harsh, but the cars and hind-feet are&nbsp;shorter, and there arc only five (in place of the usual six) pairs of&nbsp;upper cheek-teeth. In the loss of the last upper molar, the.Liu-Kiu&nbsp;rabbit approximates to the picas, as does the tailless rabbit in the&nbsp;abortion of its caudal appendage. Mr.Lyon’s scheme seems to&nbsp;be the best attempt to explain the affinities of the members cf the&nbsp;gjoup. Whether all his genera be adopted, or.all. the species, be&nbsp;included in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lepus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> must largely be a matter of individual opinion.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
