The ſubjects of this unfortunate prince, incenſed at the cruel treatment he had received, forced the perpetrators of it to fly to Novo-gorod, and reinſtated their lawful ſovereign at Moſcow, where he died.</p><p>In the midſt of this general conſuſion, John Baſilo-vitz I. by his invincible ſpirit and refined policy, became both the conqueror and deliverer of his country, and laid the firſt foundation of its future grandeur. Obſerving with indignation the narrow limits of his power at his acceſſion to the throne, after the death of his father Baſilius the Blind, he began immediately to revolve within himſelf the means of enlarging his dominions. Marriage, though he had in reality no regard or inclination for women, ſeemed to him one of the beſt expedients he could begin with ; and accordingly he demanded and obtained Maria, filter of Michael duke of Twer ; whom he ſoon after depoied, under pretence of revenging the injuries done to his father, and added this duchy to his own territories of Moſcow. Maria, by whom he had a ſon named <hi rend="italic">John, </hi>who died before him, did not live long ; and upon her ' death he married Sophia, daughter oſ Thomas Paleo-logus, who had been driven ſrom Ccnſtantinople, and forced to take ſhelter at Rome, where the pope portioned this princeſs, in hopes of procuring thereby great advantage to the Romiſh religion; but his expectations were fruſtrated, Sophia being obliged to conform to the Greek church after her arrival in Ruſſia. What could induce Baſilovitz to ſeek a confort at ſuch a diſtance, is nowhere accounted for; unleſs it be, that he hoped by this means to eſtabliſh a pretenſion to the empire of the eaſt, to which her father was the'next heir : but however that may be, the Ruſſians certainly owed to this alliance their deliverance from the Tartar yoke. Shocked at the fervile homage exacted by thoſe proud victors, her huſhand going to meet their ambai-ſadors at ſome diſtance from the city, and ſtanding to hear what they had to ſay ; whilſt they were at dinner, Sophia told him, that ſhe was ſurpriſed to find that ſhe had married a ſervant to the Tartars. Nettled at this reproach, Baſilovitz feigned himſelf ill when the next deputation from the Tartars arrived, and under that pretence avoided a repetition of the ſtipulated humiliating ceremonial. Another circumſtance equally diſ-pleaſing to this princeſs was, that the Tartars had, by agreement, within the walls of the palace at Moſcow, houſes in which their miniſters reſided ; to ſhow their power, and at the ſame time watch the actions of the great duke. To get rid of theſe, a formal embaſſy was ſent to the Tartarian khan, to tell him, that Sophia having been favoured with a viſion ſrom above, ordering her to build a temple in the place where thoſe houſes ſtood, her mind could not be at eaſe till ſhe had fulfilled the divine command; and therefore his leave was deſired fo pull them down, and give his people others. The khan conſented: the houſes within the ' Kremlin were demoliſhed; and no new ones being provided, the Tartar reſidents were obliged to leave Moſcow’ ; their prince not being able to revenge this breach of promiſe, by reaſon of a war he was then engaged in wfith the Poles. Baſilovitz taking advantage of this circumſtance, and having in the mean time conſi-1 derably increaſed his forces, openly diſclaimed all ſub-jection to the Tartars, attacked their dominions, and made himſelf maſter of Caſan, where he was ſolemnly crowned with the diadem of that kingdom, which is ſaid to be the ſame that is now uſed for the coronation of the Ruffian ſovereigns. The province of Permia, with great part of Lapland and Aliatic Bulgaria, ſoon ſubmitted to him ; and Great Novogorod, a city then ſo famous that the Ruffians uſed to expreſs its vaſt importance by the proverbial expreſſion of, <hi rend="italic">Who can re-ββ God and the Great Novogorod ?</hi>  was reduced by his generals after a ſeven years ſiege, and yielded him an immenſe treaſure ; no leſs, ſay ſome writers, than 300 cart loads of gold and ſilver, and other valuable effects. Alexander Witold, waiwode of Lithuania, was in poſe ſeſſion of this rich place, from which he had exacted for ſome years an annual tribute of 100,coo rubles, a prodigious ſum for thoſe days and ſor that country. When it was taken by John Baſilovitz, he, the better to ſecure his conqueſt, put it under the protection ol the Poles, voluntarily rendered himſelf their tributary for it, and accepted a governor from the hand of their king Caſimir, a weak and indolent prince, from whom he well knew he had nothing to fear. The No-</p><p>vogorodians continued to enjoy all their privileges till about two years after ; when John, ambitious of reigning without controul, entered their city with a numerous retinue, under pretence of keeping to the Greek faith, he being accuſed of an intention to embrace the Romiſh religion ; and with the aſſiſtance of the archbiſhop Theophilus, ſtripped them all of their remaining riches. He then depoſed the treacherous prelate, and eſtabliſh-ed over Novogorod new magiſtrates, creatures of his own ; deſtroying at once, by this means, a noble city, which, had its liberties been protected, and its trade encouraged, might have proved to him -an inexhauſtible fund of wealth. All the north beheld with terror and alto-niſhment the rapid increaſe of the victor’s power : foreign nations courted his alliance; and the ſeveral petty princes of Ruſſia ſubmitted to him without reſiſtance, acknowledging themſelves his vaſſals.</p><p>The Poles, however, complained loudly of his late breach of ſaith in regard to Novogorod, and threatened revenge : upon which Baſilovitz, elated with his ſuc-ceſſes, with the riches he had amaſſed, and with the weak condition of moſt of his neighbours, ſent a body of troops into Lithuania, and ſoon became maſter oſ ſeveral oſ its towns. Caſimir applied lor aſſiſtance to Matthias king of Hungary : but was anſwered by this laſt, that his own ſoldiers were quite uadiſciplined ; that his auxiliaries had lately mutinied for want of pay; and that it was impoſſible for him to raiſe a new army out of the neighbouring countries. The Poliſh monarch in this diſtreſs was obliged to purchaſe of John a ceſſation oſ arms for two years, during which the Muſcovite made new acceſſions to his dominions.</p><p>The dukes of Servia<hi rend="sub">j</hi> whoſe territories were about</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
