<p><label>RECOVERY</label>
or <hi rend="italic">Common</hi> <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> Recovery,</hi></hi> in Engliſh law, a ſpecies of aſſurance by matter of record ; concerning the original of which it muſt be remarked, that com-mon recoveries were invented by the eccleſiaſtics to elude the ſtatutes of mortmain (ſee Tail) ; and after-wards encouraged by the ſineſſe of the courts of law in 12 Edward IV. in order to put an end to all fettered iα-heritances, and bar not only eſtates-tail, but alfo all re-mainders and reverſions expectant thereon, we have here, therefore, only to conſider, ſirſt, the <hi rend="italic">nature</hi> of a common recovery ; apd, ſecondly, its <hi rend="italic">force</hi> and <hi rend="italic">effect.</hi></p><p>I. A common recovery is a fuit or action, either ac-tual or fictitious : and in it the lands are recovered againſt the tenant of the freehold; which recovery, being a ſuppoſed abjudication of the right, binds all perſons, and veſts a free and abſolute fee-ſimple in the recoverer. To explain this as clearly and conciſely as poſſible, let us, in the ſirſt place, ſuppoſe David Edwards to be tenant of the freehold, and deſirous to fuſſer a common recovery, in order to bar, 'alj entails, remain-</p><p>ders, and reverſions, and to convey the fame in feeſſimple, to Francis Golding. To effect this, Golding is to bring an action againſt him for the lands ; and he accordingly ſues out a writ called a <hi rend="italic">prœâpe quod reddat,</hi> becauſe theſe were its initial or moſt operative words when the law-proceedings were in Latin. In this writ the demand-ant Golding alleges, that the defendant Edwards (here called the tenant) has no legal title to the land ; but that he came into poſſeſſion of it after one Hugh Hunt had turned the demandant out of it. The ſubſequent proceedings are made up into a record or recovery roll, in which the writ and complaint of the demandant are ſiiſt recited : whereupon the tenant appears, and calls upon one Jacob Morland, who is ſuppoſed, at the ori-ginal purchaſe, to have warranted the title to the te-riant ; and thereupon he prays, that the ſaid Jacob Morland may be called in to defend the title which he ſo warranted. This is called the <hi rend="italic">voucher,</hi> <hi rend="sup">&lt;¢</hi> vocatio,” or calling of Jacob Morland to warranty ; and Morland is called the <hi rend="italic">vouchee.</hi> Upon this Jacob Morland, the vouchee, appears, is impleaded, and. defends the title, whereupon Golding the demandant deſires leave of the court to imparl, or confer with the vouchee in private ; which is (as uſual) allowed him. And ſoon afterwards the demandant Goldirtg returns to court ; but Morland the vouchee difappears, or makes default, whereupon judgment is given for the demandant Golding, now call·· ed the <hi rend="italic">recοvεrlr,</hi> to recover the lands in queſtion againſt the tenant Edwards, who is now the recoveree : and. Edwards has judgment to recover of Jacob Morland lands of· equal value, in recompenſe for the lands ſo warranted by him, and now loſt by his default ; which is agreeable to the doctrine of warranty mentioned in the preceding chapter. This is called the <hi rend="italic">recompenfe,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">recovery-in value.</hi> But Jacob Morland having no lands of his own,'being uſually the crier of the cour£, who, from being frequently thus vouched, is called the <hi rend="italic">common vouchee,</hi> it is plain that Edwards has only a nominal 'recompenſe for the lands ſo recovered againſt him by Golding ; which lands are now abſolutely veſt-ed in the ſaid recoverer by judgment of law, and feiiin thereof is delivered by the ſheriſſ of the county. So that this colluſive recovery operates merely in the nature of a conveyance in fee-ſimple, from Edwards the tenant in tail to Golding the purchafer.</p><p>The recovery here deſcribed, is with a ſingle vouch-er only;-'but ſometimes it is with a double, treble, or farther voucher, as the exigency of the cale may require. And indeed it is now uſual always to have a recovery with double voucher at the leaſt : by ſirſt conveying an eſtate of freehold to any indifferent perſon, againſt whom the <hi rend="italic">pradpe</hi> is brought ; and then he vouches the tenant in tail, who vouches over the common vouchee. For, if a recovery be had immediately againſt tenant in tail, it bars only ſuch eſtate in the premiſes of which he 13 then actually ſeifed ; whereas if the recovery be had againſt another perſon, and the tenant in tail be vouched, it bars every latent right and intereſt which he may have in the" lands recovered. If Edwards therefore be tenant of the freehold in poſſeſſion, and John Barker be tenant in tail in remainder, here Edwards doth ſirſt vouch Barker, and then Barker vouches Jacob Morland the common vouchee ; who is always the laſt perſon vouched, and always makes default ; whereby the de-maπdant Golding recovers the land againſt the tenant</p>

<p>Rdwards,-and. Edwards recovers a recompense <hi rend="italic">ef</hi> equal value againſt Barker the firſt vouchee ; who recovers the like againſt Morland the common vouchee, againſt whom ſuch ideal recovery in value is always ultimately awarded.</p><p>This ſuppoſed reeompenſe in value is the reaſon why the iſſue in tail is held to be barred by a common recovery. For, if the reeoveree ſhould obtain a recom-penſe in lands from the-common vouchee (which there is a poſſibility in contemplation of law, though a very improbable one, of hiε doing), theſe lands would ſup-ply the place of thoſe ſo recovered from him by co!lu-dſion, and would deſcend to the iſſue in tail. The reafon will alfo hold with equal force as to meſt remainder-mien and reverſioners, to whom the poſſibility will re-main land revert, as a full recompenfe for the reality which they were otherwiſe entitled to: but it will not always hold ; and therefore, as Pigott ſays, the judges have been even <hi rend="italic">ajluti,</hi> in inventing other reaſons to maintain the authority of recoveries. And, in par-ticular, it hath been ſaid, that though the eſtate-tail is gone from the recoveree ; yet it is not deſtroyed, but only transferred, and ſtill ſubſiſts ; and will ever con-tin ue to ſubſiſt (by conſtruction of law) in the reco-veror, his heirs and aſſigns : and as the eſtate-tail fo continues to fubſiſt for ever, the remainders or reversions expectant on the determination of ſuch eſtate-tail can never take place.</p><p>To ∙fiιch aukward ſhifts, ſuch ſubtile refinements, and inch ſtrafige reaſoning, were our anceſtors obliged to have recourſe, in order to get the better of-that ſtub-born ſtatute <hi rend="italic">de donis.</hi> The deſign for which theſe contrivances were ſet on foot, was certainly laudable ; the tmrivetιing the fetters of eſtatestail, which were attended with a legion of miſchiefs to the commonwealth: but, while we applaud the end, we cannot but admire the means, our modern courts of juſtice have indeed adopted a move manly way of treating the ſubject ; by eonſidering common recoveries, in no other light than as the formal mode of conveyance by which tenant in tail is enabled to aliene his lands. But, ſince the ill ■eonſequences of fettered inheritances are now generally feeai arid allowed, and of courſe the utility and expedience of fitting them at liberty are apparent, it hath often been wiſhed that the proceſs of this conveyance was ſhortened, and rendered leſs ſubject to niceties, by either totally repealing the ſtatute <hi rend="italic">de donis ;</hi> which per-haps,- by reviving the old doctrine of conditional fees, might give birth to many litigations : or by veſting in every tenant in tail, of full age, the fame abſolute feeſſimple at once, which now he may obtain whenever •he pleafis, by the colhſſive fiction of a common recovery ; though this might poffibly bear hard upon thofe ’ir. remainder or reverſion, by abridging the chances they would otherwiſe frequently have, as no recovery can be ſuffered in the intervals between term and term,</p><p>. which ſometimes continue for -near five months toge-ther : or, laſtly, by empowering the tenant in tad.to bar the eſtate-tail by a ſolemn deed, to be made in term-time, and enrolled in ſome·court of.record ; which is liable to neither of the other objections, and is warranted not only- by .the uſage of our American colonies, but by the precedent of the ſtatute 21 Jac. I. c. ∣ 9 which, in the. cafi of !a bankrupt tenant in tail, empowers his commiſſioners tq fc4l the eſtate at any t <hi rend="sub">4</hi> iae <hi rend="sub">y</hi> by deed indented and enrolled. Aud if, in ſo national</p><p>a concern, th¢ emoluments of the officers concerned in paſſing recoveries are thought to be worthy attention, thofe might be provided for in the fees to be paid upon each enrollment.</p><p>2. The force and effect of common recoveries may appear, from what has been ſaid, to be an abſolute bar not only of all eſtates tail, but of remaindeιs and re-verſions expectant on the determination of ſuch eſtates. So that a tenant in tail may, by this method of aſſu-rance, convey the lands held iu tail to the recoverer, his heirs and affigns, abſolutely free and diſcharged of all conditions and limitations· in tail, and of all remainders and reverſions. But, by ſtatute 34. &amp; 35 H. VIIL c. 2c. no recovery had againſt tenant in tail of the king’s gift, whereof the. remainder or reverſion is in the king, ſhall bar ſuch eſtate-tail, or the remainder or reverſion oſ the crown. And by the ſtatute 11 H. VIL· c. 2c. no woman, after her huftand <hi rend="sup">,</hi> 6 death, ſhall fuffer a recovery of lands fettled on her by her huſhand, or fettled on her huſhand and her by any of his anceſtors-And by ſtatute 14 Eliz. c. 8. no tenant for life, of any fort, can fiιffer a recovery fo a3 to bind them in remainder or reverſion. For which reaſon, if there be tenant for life, with remainder in tail, and other remainders over, and the tenant for Iife is deſirous to fnffer a valid recovery, either he, or the tenant to the <hi rend="italic">precipe</hi> by him made, muſt vouch the remainder-man in tail, otherwiſe the recovery is void : but if he does vouch ſuch remainder-man, and he appears and vouches the common vouchee, it is then good ; for if a man be vouched and appears, and ſuffers the recovery to be had, it is as effectual to ‘ bar the eſtate-tail as if he himfclf were the recoveree.</p><p>In all recoveries, it is neceſſary that the recoveree,. or tenant to the <hi rend="italic">prαcipe,</hi> as he is ufiually called, be actually fiifid of the freehold, elfi the recovery is void. For all actions to recover the fiiſin of lands muſt be brought againſt the actual tenant of the freehold, elſe the fuit will loſe its effect ; ſince the freehold cannot be recovered of him who has it not. And, though theſe recoveries are in themfelves fabulous and fictitious, yet it is neceſſary that there be <hi rend="italic">actores 1αbui&lt;ε.</hi> properly qualified. But the nicety thought by ſome modern practitioners to.be requiſite in conveying the legal freehold, in order to make a good tenant to the <hi rend="italic">pracipe,</hi> is removed bv the proviſions of-the ſtatute 14 Geo. IL c. 20. which enacts, with a retroſpect and conformity to tlιe ancient rul¢ of law, that, though the legal freehold be veſted in leſſees, yet thoſe who are entitled to the next freehold eſtate in remainder, or reverſion, may make a good tenant to the <hi rend="italic">rrœcipe ;</hi> and that, though the deed or fine which creates ſuch tenant be fiιbie-quent to the judgment of recovery, yet iſ it be in the ſame term, the recovery ſhall be valid in law : and that though the recovery itfilf·do not appear to be entered, or be not regularly entered on record, yet the deed to make a tenant to the <hi rend="italic">prœàpe</hi> and declare the uſes of the recovery, ſhall after a poſſeſſion of 20 years be ſufficient evidence on behalf of a purchaſer for valuable conſideration, that ſuch recovery was duly ſuffered.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Recover,v of perſons drowned, or apparently dead See Re-am π ation, and the articles there referred to.</hi></p>
