        <p><span class="font3">. The great stadium of the Palatine (see 50 in fig. 17) was begun by
                Domitian, mainly built by Hadrian, and much altered or restored by&nbsp;Severus. The
                greater part of the outer walls and the large exedra&nbsp;or apse at the side, with
                upper floor for the emperor’s seat, are of&nbsp;the time of Hadiian, as is shown by
                the brick stamps, and the&nbsp;character of the brick facing, which much resembles
                that of the&nbsp;Flavian time (bricks 1⅜ inches and joints ⅜ inch
                    thick).@@<sup>2</sup> The&nbsp;stadium is surrounded with a colonnade of engaged
                shafts, forming&nbsp;a sort of aisle with gallery over it. Except those at the
                curved end,&nbsp;which are of Hadrian’s time, these piers are of the time of
                Severus,&nbsp;as are also all the flat piers along the outer wall,—one opposite
                each&nbsp;of those in the inner line. This shows either that the stadium&nbsp;must
                have been left by Hadrian in an unfinished state, or else that&nbsp;it Siiftered
                seriously from a fire or earthquake before the reign of&nbsp;Severus.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">&gt; In addition to the stadium, Hadrian built a number of very
                handsome rooms, forming a palace on the south-east side and at the&nbsp;south-west
                end of the stadium. These rooms were partly destroyed&nbsp;and partly hidden by the
                later palace of Severus, the foundations&nbsp;of which in many places cut through
                and render useless the highly&nbsp;decorated rooms of Hadrian (53 in fig. 17). The
                finest of these&nbsp;which is now visible is a room with a large window opening
                into&nbsp;the stadium near the south angle ; it lias intersecting
                barrel&nbsp;vaults, with deep coffers, richly ornamented in stucco. The
                oval&nbsp;structure shown in the plan (50 in fig. 17), with other still
                later&nbsp;additions, belongs to the 4th or 5th century, when the stadium&nbsp;was
                no longer used for races ; some of the walls, of opus mixtum,&nbsp;which cut up and
                disfigure this noble building appear to be the&nbsp;work of Theodoric, </span><span

        <p><span class="font3">The palace of Septiniius Severus was very extensive and of enormous
                height ; it extends not only all over the south angle of the Palatine&nbsp;but also
                a long way into the valley of the Circus Maximus and&nbsp;towards the Cœlian. This
                part (like Caligula’s palace) is carried&nbsp;on very lofty arched substructures, so
                as to form a level, uniform&nbsp;with the top of the hill, on which the grand
                apartments stood.&nbsp;The whole height from the base of the Palatine to several
                stories&nbsp;above its summit must have been enormous. Little now remains&nbsp;of
                the highest stories, except part of a grand staircase which led to&nbsp;them.
                Extensive baths, all richly decorated with marble linings&nbsp;and mosaics in glass
                and marble, cover a great part of the top of&nbsp;the hill. These and other parts of
                the Palatine were supplied&nbsp;with water by an aqueduct built by Nero in
                continuation of the&nbsp;Claudian aqueduct, some arches of which still exist on the
                slope&nbsp;of the Palatine (56 in fig. 17 ; see Spart., </span><span class="font3"
                style="font-style:italic;">Sept. Sev.,</span><span class="font3"> 24).
                The&nbsp;palace of Severus was restored and enlarged by Heliogabalus and&nbsp;Sevems
                    Alexander.@@<sup>3</sup> One of the main roads up to the Palatine&nbsp;passes
                under the arched substructures of Severus, and near this, at&nbsp;the foot of the
                hill, at the south angle, Septimius Severus built an&nbsp;outlying part of his
                palace, a building of great splendour dedicated&nbsp;to the Sun and Moon, called the
                Septizonium, probably from its&nbsp;seven stories or zonæ (see Jordan, </span><span
                class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Bull. Inst.,</span><span class="font3">
                1872, p. 145). It&nbsp;has been doubted whether it can really have been as much
                as&nbsp;seven stories high ; but this is not improbable when we consider&nbsp;the
                enormous height of the rest of Severus’s palace, reaching from&nbsp;the foot of the
                Palatine to far above its summit. Part of the Septi-zonium existed as late as the
                reign of Sixtus V. (1585-90), who&nbsp;destroyed it in order to use its marble
                decorations and columns in&nbsp;the new basilica of St Peter ; drawings of it are
                given by Du Perac,&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Vestigj di Roma,</span><span class="font3"> 1575, and in other works of that

        <p><span class="font3">The Velia and Germalns were two outlying spurs of the
                    Palatine.@@<sup>5 </sup>Owing to the great alterations that have been made in
                the contour&nbsp;of the hill it is now very difficult to identify these ancient
                districts&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Aim.
                Inst.,</span><span class="font3"> 1865, p. 347). The Germalus or Cermalus
                was&nbsp;probably on the side towards the Velabrum, while the Velia may&nbsp;be
                identified with that elevated ground between the Palatine and&nbsp;the Esquiline on
                which the temple of Venus and Rome and the&nbsp;arch of Titus now stand. It is
                evident that this was once much&nbsp;loftier and more abrupt than it is now ; a
                great part of it was cut&nbsp;away when the level platform for the temple of Venus
                and Rome</span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">was formed. The foundations of part of Nero’s palace aloug the road
                between this temple and the Esquiline are exposed for about&nbsp;20 to 30 feet in
                height, showing a corresponding lowering of the&nbsp;level here, and the bare tufa
                rock, cut to a flat surface, is visible&nbsp;on the site of Hadrian’s great temple ;
                that the Velia was once&nbsp;much loftier is also indicated by the story of the
                removal of Valerius&nbsp;Publicola’s dwelling.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font3">On the Velia and the adjoining Summa Sacra Via were twe temples which
                Augustus rebuilt.@@<sup>7</sup> The “ Ædes Larum ” is probably&nbsp;the “ Sacellum
                Larum ” mentioned by Tacitus </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"
                >(Aim.,</span><span class="font3"> xii. 24) as&nbsp;one of the points in the line of
                the pomœrium of Roma Quadrata.&nbsp;The Sacra Via started at the Sacellum Streniae,
                an unknown point&nbsp;on the Esquiline, probably near the baths of Titus (Varro,
                    A.A.<sub>l&nbsp;</sub>v. 47), in the quarter called Cerolia. Thence it probably
                (in Iatei&nbsp;times) Jiassed round part of the Colosseum to the slope leading
                uj&nbsp;to the arch of Titus on the Velia ; this piece of its course is
                lined&nbsp;on one side by extensive baths, attributed to Heliogabalus (45
                in&nbsp;fig. 17), and farther back, against the cliff of the Palatine,
                arc&nbsp;remains of Nero’s enormous palace (see 42 in fig. 17). From the&nbsp;arch
                of Titus or Summa Sacra Via the original line of the road has&nbsp;been altered (see
                Plate Λ'II.) ; the angle at which the scanty remains&nbsp;of the Regia are set
                probably shows the early direction of the Sacra&nbsp;A ia in passing on to the
                temple of Vesta. Its later course was&nbsp;more to the north-east, passing at a
                sharp angle from the arch oi&nbsp;Titus to the front of Constantine’s basilica, and
                on past the temple&nbsp;of Faustina. It is uncertain whether the continuation of
                this road&nbsp;to the arch of Severus was in later times called the Sacra Via
                oi&nbsp;whether it rejoined its old line along the Basilica Julia by
                the&nbsp;cross-road in front of the Ædes Jiilii. Its original line past
                the&nbsp;temple of Vesta was completely built over in the 3d and 4th&nbsp;centuries,
                anti clumsily-fitted pavements of marble and travertine&nbsp;occupy the place of the
                old basalt blocks.@@<sup>8</sup> The course of the&nbsp;Nova Via@@<sup>9</sup> (see
                figs; 16 and 17) along the palace of Caligula@@<sup>10</sup> was&nbsp;exposetl in
                1882-84. According to Varro (A.A., vi. 59) it was a&nbsp;very old road. It led up
                from the Velabrum, probably winding&nbsp;along the slope of the Palatine, round the
                north angle under the&nbsp;church of S. Maria Libératrice. The rest of its course,
                gently&nbsp;ascending towards the arch of Titus, is now exposed, as are also
                the&nbsp;stairs, possibly the Seake Anulariæ, which connected it with
                the&nbsp;Clivus A ictoriæ at the Porta Romanula ; a continuation of
                these&nbsp;stairs, still unexcavated, Ieel down to the
