<p><span class="font0">sophe coterie as to the orthodox party. He still, however, had no lack of patrons—lie never had—though his unsurpassable perversity made him quarrel with&nbsp;all in turn. The amiable duke and duchess of Luxembourg, who were his neighbours at Montlouis, made&nbsp;his acquaintance, or rather forced theirs upon him, and&nbsp;he was eagerly industrious in his literary work—indeed&nbsp;most of his best books were produced during his stay in&nbsp;the neighbourhood of Montmorency. A letter to Voltaire&nbsp;on his poem about the Lisbon earthquake embittered the&nbsp;dislike between the two, being surreptitiously published.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Nouvelle Heloise</span><span class="font0"> appeared in the same year (1760),&nbsp;and it was immensely popular. In 1662 appeared the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contrat Social</span><span class="font0"> at Amsterdam, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Émile,</span><span class="font0"> which was published both in the Low Countries and at Paris. For the&nbsp;latter the author received 6000 livres, for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contrat&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">1000.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Julie, ou La Nouvelle Heldise,</span><span class="font0"> is a novel λvritten in letters describing the loves of a man of low position and a girl of&nbsp;rank, her subsequent marriage to a respectable freethinker&nbsp;of her own station, the mental agonies of her lover, and&nbsp;the partial appeasing of the distresses of the lovers by the&nbsp;influence of noble sentiment and the good offices of a&nbsp;philanthropic Englishman. It is too long, the sentiment&nbsp;is overstrained, and severe moralists have accused it of a&nbsp;certain complaisance in dealing with amatory errors ; but it&nbsp;is full of pathos and knowledge of the human heart. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contrat Social,</span><span class="font0"> as its title implies, endeavours to base all&nbsp;government on the consent, direct or implied, of the&nbsp;governed, and indulges in much ingenious argument to&nbsp;get rid of the practical inconveniences of such a suggestion.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emde,</span><span class="font0"> the second title of which is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De l<sup>,</sup>Education,</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;much more of a treatise than of a novel, though a certain&nbsp;amount of narrative interest is kept up throughout.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rousseau’s reputation was now higher than ever, but the term of the comparative prosperity which he had enjoyed&nbsp;foe nearly ten years was at hand. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Contrat Social&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">was obviously anti-monarchic ; the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Nouvelle Heldise</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;said to be immoral ; the sentimental deism of the “ Profession du vicaire Savoyard ” in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emile</span><span class="font0"> irritated equally the&nbsp;philosophe party and the church. On June 11, 1662,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emile</span><span class="font0"> was condemned by the parlement of Paris, and&nbsp;two days previously Madame de Luxembourg and the&nbsp;Prince de Conti gave the author information that he&nbsp;would be arrested if he did not fly. They also furnished&nbsp;him with means of flight, and he made for Yverdun in&nbsp;the territory of Bern, whence he transferred himself to&nbsp;Motiers in Neuchâtel, which then belonged to Prussia.&nbsp;Frederick II. was not indisposed to protect the persecuted&nbsp;when it cost him nothing aud might bring him fame, and&nbsp;in Marshal Keith, the governor of Neuchâtel, Rousseau&nbsp;found a true and firm friend. He was, however, unable&nbsp;to be quiet or to practise any of those more or less pious&nbsp;frauds which, were customary at the time with the unorthodox. . The archbishop of Paris had published a pastoral&nbsp;against him, and Rousseau did not let the year pass&nbsp;without a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lettre à M. de Beaumont.</span><span class="font0"> The council of&nbsp;Geneva had joined in the condemnation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Emile,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;Rousseau first solemnly renounced his citizenship, and then,&nbsp;in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lettres de la Montagne</span><span class="font0"> (1763), attacked the council&nbsp;and the Genevan constitution unsparingly. AU this&nbsp;excited public opinion against him, and gradually he grew&nbsp;unpopular in his own neighbourhood. This unpopularity&nbsp;is said on very uncertain authority to have culminated in&nbsp;a nocturnal attack on his house, which reminds the reader&nbsp;remarkably of an incident in the life of the greatest French&nbsp;man of letters of the present century. At any rate he&nbsp;thought he was menaced if he was not, and migrated to the&nbsp;île St Pierre in the Lake of Bienne, where he once more for&nbsp;a short, and the last, time enjoyed that idyUic existence&nbsp;which he loved. But the Bernese Government ordered him&nbsp;to quit its territory. He was for some time uncertain where&nbsp;to go, and thought of Corsica (to join Paoli) and Berhn.&nbsp;But finally David Hume offered him, late in 1765, an&nbsp;asylum in England, and he accepted. He passed through&nbsp;Paris, where his presence w<sup>,</sup>as tolerated for a time, and&nbsp;landed in England on January 13, 1766. Thérèse travelled&nbsp;separately, and was entrusted to the charge of James&nbsp;Boswell, who had already made Rousseau’s acquaintance.&nbsp;Here he had once more a chance of settling peaceably.&nbsp;Severe English moralists like Johnson thought but ill of&nbsp;him, but the public generally was not unwilling to testify&nbsp;against French intolerance, and regarded his sentimentalism with favour. He was lionized in London to his&nbsp;heart’s content and discontent, for it may truly be said&nbsp;of Rousseau that he was equally indignant at neglect and&nbsp;intolerant of attention. When, after not a few displays&nbsp;of his strange humour, he professed himself tired of the&nbsp;capital, Hume procured him a country abode in the house&nbsp;of Mr Davenport at Wootton in Derbyshire. Here,&nbsp;though the place w<sup>,</sup>as bleak and lonely, he might have&nbsp;been happy enough, and he actually employed himself in&nbsp;writing the greater part of his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessiotis.</span><span class="font0"> But his&nbsp;habit of self-tormenting and tormenting others never left&nbsp;him. His own caprices interposed some delay in the conferring of a pension which George III. was induced to&nbsp;grant him, and he took this as a crime of Hume’s. The&nbsp;publication of a spiteful letter (really by Horace Walpole,&nbsp;one of whose worst deeds it was) in the name of the king&nbsp;of Prussia made Rousseau believe that plots of the most&nbsp;terrible kind were on foot against him. Finally he&nbsp;quarrelled with Hume because the latter would not&nbsp;acknowledge all his own friends and Rousseau’s supposed&nbsp;enemie3 of the philosophe circle to be rascals. He remained, however, at Wootton during the year and through&nbsp;the winter. In May 1767 he fled to France, addressing&nbsp;letters to the lord chancellor and to General Conway,&nbsp;which can only be described as the letters of a lunatic.&nbsp;He was received in France by the Marquis de Mirabeau&nbsp;(father of the great Mirabeau), of whom he soon had&nbsp;enough, then by the Prince de Conti at Trye. From this&nbsp;place he again fled and wandered about for some time in&nbsp;a wretched fashion, still writing the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions,</span><span class="font0"> constantly&nbsp;receiving generous help, and always quarrelling with, or at&nbsp;least suspecting, the helpers. In the summer of 1770 he&nbsp;returned to Paris, resumed music copying, and was on the&nbsp;whole happier than he had been since he had to leave&nbsp;Montlouis. He had by this time married Thérèse le&nbsp;Vasseur, or had at least gone through some form of marriage&nbsp;with her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many of the best-known stories of Rousseau’s life date from this last time, when he was tolerably accessible to&nbsp;visitors, though clearly half-insane. He finished his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions,</span><span class="font0"> wrote his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dialogues</span><span class="font0"> (the interest of which is not&nbsp;quite equal to the promise of their curious sub-title&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rousseau juge de Jean Jacques),</span><span class="font0"> and began his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reveries du&nbsp;Promeneur Solitaire,</span><span class="font0"> intended as a sequel and complement&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Confessions,</span><span class="font0"> and one of the best of all his books.&nbsp;It should be said that besides these, which complete the&nbsp;list of his principal works, he has left a very large number&nbsp;of minor w<sup>τ</sup>orks and a considerable correspondence. During&nbsp;this time he lived in the Rue Platière, which is now&nbsp;named after him. But his suspicions of secret enemies&nbsp;grew stronger rather than weaker, and at the beginning of&nbsp;1778 he was glad to accept the offer of M. de Girardin, a&nbsp;rich financier, and occupy a cottage at Ermenonville. The&nbsp;country w<sup>τ</sup>as beautiful ; but his old terrors revived, and his&nbsp;woes were complicated by the alleged inclination of Thérèse&nbsp;for one of M. de Girardin’s stable boys. On July 2d he&nbsp;died in a manner which has been much discussed, sus-</span></p>
