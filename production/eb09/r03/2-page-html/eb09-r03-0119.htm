                    called the “piano regolatore,” is being (1886) gradually carried&nbsp;out, with
                    the object of reducing hills and valleys to one uniform&nbsp;level, on which
                    wide boulevards are being constructed on the chessboard plan of an American
                    city. The constant fires which have&nbsp;devastated Rome have been a great agent
                    in obliterating the natural&nbsp;contour of the ground. The accumulated rubbish
                    from these and&nbsp;other causes has in some places covered the ground to the
                    depth&nbsp;of 40 feet, especially in the valleys.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The climate of Rome in ancient times appeal's to have been colder
                    than it is at present. Malarious fever in and around the&nbsp;city existed to
                    some extent, but to a much less degree than it does&nbsp;now. The magnificent
                    villa of Hadrian and other country houses&nbsp;near Rome are built on sites
                    which are now very unhealthy. The&nbsp;sanitary superiority of the Campagna in
                    ancient times was mainly&nbsp;due to its more complete drainage and thicker
                    population. That&nbsp;fever did exist is, however, proved in many ways. Altars
                    to the&nbsp;goddess Febris were erected on the Palatine and other hills,
                    and&nbsp;on the Esquiline was a grove dedicated to Mephitis. The population of
                        Rome@@<sup>1</sup> increased with great rapidity, till, during its
                    most&nbsp;populous period in the 4th century, it was probably not less
                    than&nbsp;2⅛ millions.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>

                    Palatine,&nbsp;and Capitoline Hills contained quarries of the tufa, much
                    worked&nbsp;at an early period (see Liv., xxvi. 27, xxxix. 44, and Varro,
                    A.Z.,&nbsp;iv. 151). It is a very bad “weather-stone,” but stands well if

                    (travertine), the chief quarries of which are at&nbsp;Tibur (Tivoli) and other
                    places along the river Anio, is a hard pure&nbsp;carbonate of lime, of a creamy
                    white colour, deposited from running or dripping water in a highly stratified
                    form, with frequent&nbsp;cavities and fissures lined with crystals. As Vitruvius
                    (ii. 5) says,&nbsp;it is a good weather-stone, but is soon calcined by fire. If
                    laid&nbsp;horizontally it is very strong, but if set on end its crystalline
                    structure is a great source of weakness, and it splits from end to
                    end.&nbsp;Neglect on the part of Roman builders of this important precaution in
                    many cases caused a complete failure in the structure. This&nbsp;was notably the
                    case in the rostra (see below). (6) </span><span class="font1"

                    and round the city of Rome. When mixed&nbsp;with lime it forms a very strong
                    hydraulic cement, of equal use in&nbsp;concrete, mortar, or undercoats of
                    stucco. It is to this material&nbsp;that the concrete walls of Rome owe their
                    enormous strength and&nbsp;durability, in many cases far exceeding those of the
                    most massive&nbsp;stone masonry. Vitruvius devotes a chapter (bk. ii. ch. 6) to
                    this&nbsp;very important material.</span></p>

            <p><span class="font1">Marble appears to have come into use about the beginning of the
                    1st century B.c. Its introduction was at first viewed with great&nbsp;jealousy,
                    as savouring of Greek luxury. The orator Crassus was&nbsp;the first to use it in
                    his house on the Palatine, built about 92 b.c. ;&nbsp;and, though he had only
                    six small columns of Hymettian marble,&nbsp;he was for this luxury nicknamed the
                    “Palatine Venus” by the&nbsp;stern republican M. Brutus (Plin., </span><span

                    3). The temporary wooden theatre of the ædile M. Æmilius Scaurus, built in
                    58&nbsp;b.c., appears to have been the first building in which marble
                    was&nbsp;more largely used ; its 360 columns and the lower order of its
                    scena&nbsp;were of Greek marble (see Plin., </span><span class="font1"
