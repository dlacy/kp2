<p><span class="font0">gold medal). At the end of 1812 the 20th was again engaged in the Peninsula, and Major-General Ross early in the following&nbsp;year received a brigade command in Cole’s division. Scarcely&nbsp;engaged at Vittoria, Ross’s brigade played a distinguished part&nbsp;in the operations around Pamplona, and the 20th covered&nbsp;itself with glory at Roncesvalles and Sorauren. At Orthez&nbsp;Ross was severely wounded at the head of the brigade, which&nbsp;was assaulting the village of St Boes. He was among those&nbsp;who received the thanks of parliament for this battle, and he&nbsp;received the gold medal for Vittoria and the Peninsula gold&nbsp;medal. At the end of the war Ross was sent in command of a&nbsp;brigade to harry the coast of North America, and with 4500&nbsp;men and three light guns landed in Maryland. At Bladensburg&nbsp;the Americans stood to fight in a strong position, but Ross’s men&nbsp;routed them (Aug. 24, 1814). The same evening Washington&nbsp;was entered, and, the public buildings having been destroyed, the&nbsp;expedition re-embarked. This short and brilliant campaign&nbsp;excited the admiration of soldiers, critics and public alike, but&nbsp;the commander did not live to receive his reward. A few days&nbsp;later an expedition against Baltimore was undertaken; skirmishing soon began, and one of the first to fall was Ross. A public&nbsp;monument was erected to his memory in St Paul’s Cathedral,&nbsp;and others at his residence at Rosstrevor and at Halifax, N.S.&nbsp;His family was granted the name Ross of Bladensburg by royal&nbsp;letters-patent.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSS, a market town in the Ross parliamentary division of Herefordshire, England; 133 m. W. by N. from London&nbsp;and 12 S.E. from Hereford by the Great Western railway.&nbsp;Pop. of urban district (1901) 3303. It occupies a fine position&nbsp;on and about a rocky eminence on the left bank of the river Wye.&nbsp;There are manufactures of machinery and agricultural implements, and trade in the products of the district, such as cider&nbsp;and malt, and several fairs are held annually. The church of&nbsp;St Mary the Virgin stands high, and is surmounted by a lofty&nbsp;spire; it shows good Decorated and Perpendicular work. A&nbsp;beautiful terrace called the Prospect adjoins the churchyard&nbsp;and overlooks the river. The market house, dated 1670, is a&nbsp;picturesque building supported on columns, the upper portion&nbsp;serving as a town hall. There are in the town many memorials&nbsp;of John Kyrie, the Man of Ross, who died here in 1724, and&nbsp;is eulogized by Pope in his third </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moral Epistle</span><span class="font0"> (1732). The&nbsp;Prospect was acquired and laid out by Kyrie, who also planted&nbsp;the fine elm avenues near the church; his house stands opposite&nbsp;the market house, where he disbursed his charities; he erected&nbsp;the church spire, and is buried in the chancel, where his grave&nbsp;remained without a monument until Pope called attention&nbsp;to the omission. Nearly opposite the town is Wilton Castle,&nbsp;which defended the ford in the disturbed reign of Stephen, and&nbsp;suffered in the Civil Wars, being held for the Parliament and&nbsp;burned by the Royalists. The inhabited portion is modern.&nbsp;Four miles below Ross the important ford of Goodrich probably&nbsp;carried traffic in British and Roman times, and a magnificent&nbsp;castle, on a precipice rising sheer above the right bank of the&nbsp;river, commands it. The keep is doubtfully assigned to a date&nbsp;previous to the Conquest; the important position on the Welsh&nbsp;March led to several subsequent additions, especially in the&nbsp;14th century, and the castle was only, dismantled by order of the&nbsp;Parliamentarians after it had strongly resisted their arms on&nbsp;behalf of Charles I. in 1646, being the last to fall of the royal&nbsp;strongholds in this county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ross (Ros, Rosse) was granted to the see of Hereford by Edmund Ironside, but became crown property by an exchange&nbsp;effected in 1559. It derived importance from its situation on&nbsp;the road to South Wales. In 1305, only, it was represented&nbsp;in parliament by two members; but it was never incorporated,&nbsp;and was governed by appointees of the manor court, until the&nbsp;Ross Improvement Act of 1865 established elected commissioners of the borough. Fairs on the days of the Ascension,&nbsp;Corpus Christi, St Margaret and St Andrew were conferred by&nbsp;Henry III., and were in existence in 1888. A market every</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROSS AND CROMARTY, a northern county of Scotland. The mainland portion is bounded N. by Sutherland and&nbsp;Dornoch Firth, E. by the North Sea and Moray Firth, S. by&nbsp;Beauly Firth and Inverness-shire and W. by the strait of the&nbsp;Minch. The island portion, consisting of as much of the island&nbsp;of Lewis as lies north of a line drawn from Loch Resort to Loch&nbsp;Seaforth, is bounded on the W., N. and E. by the Atlantic,&nbsp;and S. by Harris, the southern part of Lewis. Many islands,&nbsp;all but eleven uninhabited, are scattered principally off the&nbsp;west coasts of Lewis and the mainland. The area of the mainland is 1,572,294 acres and of the islands 404,413 acres, giving&nbsp;a total for the county of 1,976,707 acres or 3088-6 sq. m. The&nbsp;inhabited islands belonging to the mainland are all situated off&nbsp;the west coast. They arc Gillean (lighthouse) in the parish&nbsp;of Lochalsh, Croulin in Applecross, Horisdale, Dry and Ewe&nbsp;in Gairloch parish, and Martin and Tanera More, of the group&nbsp;of the Summer Isles in the parish of Lochbroom. On the North&nbsp;Sea front the chief indentations are Beauly Firth and Inner&nbsp;Moray Firth, marking off the Black Isle from Inverness-shire;&nbsp;Cromarty Firth, bounding the districts of Easter Ross and the&nbsp;Black Isle; Moray Firth, separating Easter Ross from Nairnshire; and Dornoch Firth, dividing north-east Ross from Suther-landshire. On the Atlantic face—which is a coastline of more&nbsp;than 300 m.—the. principal sea lochs and bays, from S. to N.,&nbsp;are Loch Duich, Loch Alsh, Loch Carron, Loch Kishorn, Loch&nbsp;Torridon, Loch Shieldaig, Upper Loch Torridon, Gairloch, Loch&nbsp;Ewe, Gruinard Bay, Little Loch Broom and Enard Bay. The&nbsp;chief capes are Tarbat Ness on the east coast, and Coygach,&nbsp;Greenstone, Reidh, Red and Hamha Points on the west.&nbsp;Almost all the southern boundary with Inverness-shire is&nbsp;guarded by a rampart of peaks, among them being An Ria-bhachan (3696), Sgurr na Lapaich (3773), Cam Eige (3877),&nbsp;Mam Soul (3862), Ben Attow (3383), Scour Ouran (3505),&nbsp;famous for its view from the summit, Ben Mohr (3570) and&nbsp;the Saddle (3317). To the north of Glen Torridon occur the&nbsp;masses of the Liatach, with peaks of 3456 and 3358 ft., and&nbsp;Ben Eay with four peaks above 3000 ft. each. On the northeastern shore of Loch Maree rises Ben Slioch (3217), while the&nbsp;Fannich group contains at least six peaks of more than 3000 ft.&nbsp;The immense isolated bulk of Ben Wyvis (3429), and its subordinate peaks An Socach (3295) and An Cabar (3106), is the&nbsp;most noteworthy feature in the north-east, and the Challich&nbsp;Hills in the north-west with peaks of 3483 and 3474 ft. are&nbsp;equally conspicuous, though less solitary. Only a small&nbsp;fraction of western and southern Ross is under 1000 ft. in&nbsp;height. Easter Ross and the peninsula of the Black Isle are&nbsp;comparatively level. The longest stream is the Orrin, which&nbsp;rises in An Sithean and pursues a course mainly E. by N. to&nbsp;its confluence with the Conon after a run of about 26 m.,&nbsp;during a small part of which it forms the boundary with Inverness-shire. At Aultgowrie the stream rushes through a narrow&nbsp;gorge where the drop is considerable enough to make the falls&nbsp;of Orrin. From its source in the mountains in Strathvaich the&nbsp;Blackwater flows S.E. for 19 m. till it joins the Conon, forming&nbsp;soon after it leaves Loch Garve the small but picturesque&nbsp;falls of Rogie. Within a short distance of its exit from&nbsp;Loch Luichart the Conon pours over a series of graceful cascades&nbsp;and rapids and then pursues a winding course of 12 m., mainly&nbsp;E. to the head of Cromarty Firth. The falls of Glomach, in&nbsp;the south-west, are the deepest in the United Kingdom. The&nbsp;stream giving rise to them drains a series of small lochs on the&nbsp;northern flanks of Ben Attow and, in an almost unbroken&nbsp;sheet about 40 ft. broad, effects a sheer leap of 370 ft., and&nbsp;soon afterwards ends its course in the Elchaig. The falls are&nbsp;usually visited from Invershiel, 7 m. to the south-west.&nbsp;Twelve miles south by east of Ullapool, on the estate of Brae-more, are the falls of Measach, formed by the Droma, a head-stream of the Broom. The cascades, three in number, are&nbsp;close to the gorge of Corriehalloch. The Oykell, throughout&nbsp;its course, forms the boundary with Sutherlandshire, to which</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
