(Quintus), a Pythagorean philoſopher, flouriſhed in the time of Auguſtus. He ſeemed formed to rise in the republic; but he ſhrunk from civil honours, and declined accepting the rank of ſenator when it was offered him by Julius Cæsar, that he might have time to apply to philoſophy. It appears that he wiſh. ed to eſtabliſh a ſchool at Rome, and that his tenets, though chiefly drawn from the doctrines of Pythagoras, in ſome particulars reſembled thoſe of the Stoics.</p><p>He ſoon found himſelf involved in many difficulties. His laws were tinctured with great ſeverity ; and in an early period of his eſtabliſhment, he found his mind ſo haraſſed, and the harſhneſs of the doctrines which he wiſhed to eſtabliſh ſo repulſive to his feelings, that he had nearly worked himſelf up to ſuch an height of deſperation as to reſolve on putting a period to his exiſtence.</p><p>Of the ſchool of Sextius were Fabianus, Sotion, Flavianus, Craſſitius, and Celſus. Of his works only a few fragments remain ; and whether any of them formed a part of the work which Seneca admired ſo much, cannot now be determined. Some of his maxims are valuable. He recommended an examination of the actions of the day to his ſcholars when they retired to rest ; he taught, that the road to Heaven (ad astra) was by frugality, temperance, and fortitude. He uſed to recommend holding a looking-glaſs before perſons diſordered with paſſion. He enjoined his scholars to abstain from animal food.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
