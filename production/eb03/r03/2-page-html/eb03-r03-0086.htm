<p><span class="font0">miſtaken policy which yet prevails in the nation, of ſuppreſſing all accounts of their origin, and inquiries&nbsp;into their ancient ſtate and ſituation ; of which we have&nbsp;a remarkable inſtance in the ſuppreſſion of a work by&nbsp;profeffor Muller, intitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Originlbus Gentis et Nominis&nbsp;Rufforum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">According to ſeveral authors of credit, the Ruffians derived their origin from the Slavi or Slavonians, corruptly called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sclavonians,</span><span class="font0"> who fettled ſirſt along&nbsp;the banks of the Volga, and afterwards near the Danube, in the countries named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bulgaria</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hungary;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">but being driven from thence by the Romans (whom&nbsp;the Ruffians call </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wolochers,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wolotaners'),</span><span class="font0"> they firſt&nbsp;removed to the river Boryſthenes, or Dneiper, then&nbsp;•over-ran Poland, and, as is reported, built the city of&nbsp;Kiow. Afterwards they extended their colonies farther north, to the rivers which run into the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ilmen</span><span class="font0"> lake,&nbsp;and laid the foundation of the city of Novogorod. The&nbsp;towns,of Smolenſk and Tſernikow appear alſo to have&nbsp;been built by them, though the dares-of theſe events .&nbsp;cannot be aſcertained. The moſt ancient inhabitants,&nbsp;not only of Ruſſia, but all over Siberia, quite to the&nbsp;borders of China, are called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">TJhucli ;</span><span class="font0"> for profeffor Muller, on inquiring in thoſe parts by whom the ancient&nbsp;buildings and ſepulchral monuments he ſaw there, were&nbsp;erected, was everywhere anſwered, that they were the&nbsp;works of the Tſhudi, who in ancient times had lived in&nbsp;that country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the ninth century, the Scandinavians., that is, the Danes, Norwegians, and Swedes, emigrated from the&nbsp;north, and, crofling the Baltic^ went to ſeek habitations&nbsp;in Ruſſia. They firſt ſubdued the Courlanders, Livonians, and Eſthonians ; and, extending their conqueils&nbsp;ftill ſarther, they exacted tribute from the Novogorodi-ans, ſettled kings over them, and traded as far as Kiow,&nbsp;and even to Greece. Theſe new invaders were called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Waregers ;</span><span class="font0"> which, according to profeffor Muller, fignifies “ ſea-faring people or, it derived from the old&nbsp;northern word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">war,</span><span class="font0"> it fignifies “ warlike men.” To&nbsp;theſe Waregers the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ruffles, or Ruffians,</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;thought by the moſt eminent authors to owe its origin ; but the etymology of the word itſelf is entirely&nbsp;uncertain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the dark ages of which we are ſpeaking, it is ! pretty certain that Ruſſia was divided among a great&nbsp;-number of petty princes, who made war upon each&nbsp;' other with the ferocity and cruelty of wild beaſts ; ſo&nbsp;that the whole country was reduced to the utmoſt ml-ſery ; when Goſtomiſel, a chief of the Novogorodians,&nbsp;pitying the unhappy fate of his countrymen, and ſeeing no other method of remedying their calamities,&nbsp;adviſed them to offer the government of their country&nbsp;to the Waregers. The propoſal was readily accepted,&nbsp;and three princes of great abilities and valour were ſent&nbsp;to govern them ; namely, Ruric, Sineus, and Truwor,&nbsp;generally ſuppoſed to have been brothers. The firſt&nbsp;took up his refidence at Ladoga, in the principality of&nbsp;Great Novogorod ; the ſecond at Bielo Oſero, or the&nbsp;White Lake ; and the third kept his court at Iſhorſk,&nbsp;or, according to others, at a ſmall town, then called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Twcrizog,</span><span class="font0"> in the principality of Pleſkow. The three&nbsp;brothers reigned amicably, and made conſiderable additions to-their dominions ; all of which at length devolved&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font0">Ruric by the death of Sineus and Truwor j but what</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><h2><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font1">the conqueſts of the two brothers were, we have no </span><span class="font2">re</span><span class="font0">cords to inform us of.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">Ruric, to his honour, became zealous for the ſtrict adminiſtration of juſtice ; and iffued a command to all:&nbsp;the boyars who poffeffed territories under him, to exer-i&nbsp;ciſe it in an exact and uniform manner. To this end,&nbsp;it was neceffary there ſhould be general laws. And&nbsp;this naturally leads us to conjecture, that letters were&nbsp;not entirely unknown in his dominions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Ruffian empire continued to flouriſh till the end ^ of the reign of Wolodomir, who aſcended the throne&nbsp;in the year 976. Having ſettled the affairs of his empire in peace, he demanded in marriage the princeſs&nbsp;Anne, fiſter to the Greek emperor Bafιlius Porphyro-genitus. His fuit w<sup>,</sup>as granted, on condition that he&nbsp;ſhould embrace Chriſtianity. With this the Ruffian&nbsp;monarch complied ; and that vaſt empire was thenceforward conſidered as belonging to the patriarchate of&nbsp;Conſtantinople. Wolodomir received the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ba-ltlius</span><span class="font0"> on the day on which he was baptized ; and,&nbsp;according to the Ruffian annals, zo,ooo of his ſubjects&nbsp;were baptized the ſame day. Michael Syra, or Cyrus,&nbsp;a Greek, ſent by Photius the patriarch of Conſtantinople, was accepted as metropolitan of the whole country. At the ſame time, Wolodomir put away all his&nbsp;former wives and concubines, of whom he had upwards&nbsp;of 800, and by whom he had 12 Tons, who were baptized on the ſame day with himſelf. The idols of pa-ganiſm were now thrown down ; churches and mona-lteries were erected, towns built, and the arts began&nbsp;to flouriſh. The Sclavonian letters were now firſt introduced into Ruſſia ; and Wolodomir ſent miflionaries&nbsp;to convert the Bulgarians ; but only three or four of&nbsp;their princes came to him and were baptized. Theſe&nbsp;events happened in the year 987.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wolodomir called the arts from Greece, cultivated them in the peaceable periods of his reign, and rewarded their proſeffors with generality, that he might dif-pel the clouds of ignorance which enveloped his country, call forth the genius of his countrymen, and render&nbsp;them happy. He alſo founded public ſchools, and&nbsp;enacted a law concerning the methods of inſtructing&nbsp;youth, and directing the conduct of the maſters appointed to inftruct them. He died in 1008, and, contrary to all rules of found policy and prudence, divided&nbsp;his empire among his 12 fons. The conſequence was,&nbsp;that they fell to making war and deſtroying one another as ſoon as their father was dead. 8uantepolk, one&nbsp;of the brothers, having deſtroyed and ſeized upon the&nbsp;dominions of two others, was himſelf driven out by Ja-riſlaus, and obliged to fly to Boleſlaus king of Poland.&nbsp;This brought on a dreadful war betwixt the Poles and&nbsp;Ruffians ; in which the former were victorious, and the&nbsp;latter loſt a great part of their dominions, as has been&nbsp;related under the article Poland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jariilaus finding himſelf unable to oppoſe the king of Poland, now turned his arms againſt the reſt of his&nbsp;brothers, all of whom he diſpoſſeffed of their dominions,&nbsp;and ſeized them for himſelf. He next attacked the Coſ-ſacks, over w<sup>,</sup>hom he gained ſeveral advantages. After&nbsp;which he ventured once more to try his fortune with&nbsp;Boleſlaus : but in this ſecond expedition he was attended with worſe ſucceſs than before ; being now reduced «to the· condition oſ a vaffal and tributary to the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
