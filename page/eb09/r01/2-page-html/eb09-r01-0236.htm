<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The protophytic Algae are reproduced by asexually developed </span><span class="font0">3</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">- spores, but iu some forms an indication is already given of the&nbsp;differentiation of these spores into sexual reproductive cells which&nbsp;takes place in the higher forms of the group. In Protococcus, for&nbsp;instance, zoospores are produced, but the zoospores are not all&nbsp;precisely similar. In some cases the protoplasm of the cell divides&nbsp;only once or twice, the result being the formation of two or four&nbsp;relatively large zoospores, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">macrozoospores·,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in other cases the&nbsp;protoplasm divides a greater number of times so that a considerable&nbsp;number of relatively small zoospores, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">microzoospores,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> are produced. Functionally these zoospores are alike; they all come to&nbsp;rest, and form new Protococci. Amongst the Confervoidae, which&nbsp;are more highly organized plants than the protophytic Algai, we&nbsp;find forms, of which Ulothrix may be taken as the type,&nbsp;which likewise produce macrozoospores and microzoospores in their&nbsp;־ cells. The macrozoospores of Ulothrix simply come to rest and&nbsp;germinate; they are distinctly asexual spores. The microzoospores&nbsp;may also do this, but not unfrequently they coalesce in pairs ; the&nbsp;product of fusion, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">zygospore,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> as it is termed, then develops into a&nbsp;Ulothrix filament. This fusion of two similar reproductive cells—&nbsp;this conjugation, as it is termed—is one of the simplest forms of the&nbsp;sexual process ; the zygospore is then a sexually produced spore,&nbsp;and the two cells which conjugate to form it are spoken of as&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">gametes,—planogametes</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> when they possess cilia, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">aplanogamctes</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> when&nbsp;they do not.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Comparing Ulothrix with Protococcus, we see that in both the macrozoospores are asexual reproductive cells, whereas the microzoospores of Ulothrix exhibit an imperfect sexuality, inasmuch as&nbsp;they may germinate without previous conjugation. The piano-gametes of Ulothrix are, however, to be directly connected with&nbsp;the microzoospores of Protococcus; that is to say, the gametes are&nbsp;to be traced back to asexual spores. This is a point of fundamental&nbsp;importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Similarly, in Botrydium, one of the Siphoneae, there are two kinds of zoospores, some of which are asexual and others sexual ; the&nbsp;visible difference between them is, in this case, not one of size,&nbsp;but the gametes have two cilia and the zoospores only one.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the conjugation which takes place in the above-mentioned plants the gametes are quite similar in form and size, and take an&nbsp;equal part in the formation of the zygospore. The first indication&nbsp;of the differentiation of sexual gametes is afforded by </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Edo-</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">f </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">carpus siliculosus</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and Scytosiphon, belonging to the Phaeosporeae.&nbsp;The zoospores of these plants are produced in well-defined sporangia,&nbsp;some of which are multilocular and others unilocular. Inasmuch&nbsp;as only the zoospores developed in the multilocular sporangia have&nbsp;been observed to conjugate, that is, to be gametes, those developed&nbsp;in the unilocular sporangia are probably asexual. This being so,&nbsp;the multilocular sporangia are to be regarded, not as mere&nbsp;sporangia, but as sexual organs (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gametangia)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> producing sexual&nbsp;reproductive cells. The process of conjugation of the gametes is,&nbsp;according to Berthold, as follows :—the gametes are at first quite&nbsp;similar in every respect; some of them, however, soon withdraw&nbsp;their cilia and come to rest, whereas others remain actively&nbsp;motile; one of the still motile gametes then coalesces with one&nbsp;which has come to rest to form a zygospore. The gametes in this&nbsp;case behave differently in the process of conjugation : the one is&nbsp;passive, the other active ; the former is to be regarded as the&nbsp;female, and the latter as the male reproductive cell. But even in&nbsp;this case the gametes, if they fail to conjugate, can germinate&nbsp;independently.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Cutleria the sexual differentiation of the reproductive cells is more marked ; the male and female cells are developed in distinct&nbsp;sporangia, which may be termed respectively </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">antliericlia</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">oogonia,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> two male cells being formed in each antheriilium, and one&nbsp;female cell in each oogonium; the female cell is considerably&nbsp;larger than the male, but they are both planogametes, that is,&nbsp;conjugating cells which swim by means of cilia ; the female cell,&nbsp;however, soon withdraws its cilia and comes to rest, and then&nbsp;conjugation takes place, with the formation of a zygospore, much&nbsp;in the same way as in Ectocarpus described above.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The next stage in the sexual differentiation of the Algae is to be found in such forms as Yolvox, Yaucheria, (Edogonium, Fucus, and&nbsp;the Characeae. In these plants, as in Cutleria, the reproductive&nbsp;cells are entirely incapable of independent germination ; they have&nbsp;lost altogether that characteristic property of spores ; as in Cutleria&nbsp;also they are developed in two kinds of sporangia—antheridia and&nbsp;oogonia—and they are very different from each other in their form,&nbsp;size, and behaviour. In most cases the oogonium gives rise to a&nbsp;single relatively large cell, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">oosphere,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is at no time provided&nbsp;with cilia, and is not set free from the oogonium ; in some of the&nbsp;Fucaceae, there may, however, be two (Pelvetia), four (Ozotliallia&nbsp;[Ascophyllum]), or eight (Fucus) oospheres produced in each&nbsp;oogonium, and in all the Fucaceae the oospheres are set free from&nbsp;the oogonium. The antheridium gives rise to a large number of&nbsp;small ciliated cells, the antherozoids, one of which subsequently fuses&nbsp;with the oosphere. The coalescence of two such highly differentiated sexual cells is termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fertilization,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> to distinguish it from&nbsp;the conjugation of similar sexual cells, and the product of fertilization is termed an </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">oospore,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> to distinguish it from the product of&nbsp;conjugation, the zygospore. In these plants the antherozoids&nbsp;still retain the essential characters of planogametes, whereas the&nbsp;oospheres have lost them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">But it is not in all Algae that sexual reproduction is effected by the fusion of well-defined sexual cells. In the Florideae the sexual&nbsp;reproductive organs are well differentiated. The male organ is an&nbsp;antheridium which produces antherozoids ; but these antherozoids&nbsp;are peculiar in that they have no cilia, and are surrounded by a&nbsp;cell-wall; they are frequently, on this account, termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">spermatia.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The female organ is termed a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">procarpium</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">carpogonium ;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> it may&nbsp;consist of one or many cells, but in all cases it consists of a projecting filament, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">trichogyne,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and a more expanded basal&nbsp;portion. It is peculiar in that no well-defined oosphere exists&nbsp;within it. Fertilization is effected by the antherozoid (spermatium)&nbsp;being passively brought into contact with the trichogyne ; complete&nbsp;fusion then takes place, the contents of the spermatium passing&nbsp;into the trichogyne; the trichogyne now withers, and changes take&nbsp;place in the basal portion of the procarpium, one or more of the cells&nbsp;termed carpogenous cells divide, and by a process of budding give&nbsp;rise to a cluster of cells which are capable of germinating, and produce new plants; these are termed </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">carpospores.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> At the same time&nbsp;the cluster of spores frequently becomes surrounded by an upgrowth of tissue ; the mature fructification is termed a </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">cystocarp.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">From the female organ of the Florideae there are, then, formed, in&nbsp;consequence of fertilization, a number of reproductive cells, the&nbsp;carpospores, each of which corresponds to the oospore of plants&nbsp;like Fucus, Vaueheria, &amp;c. A more detailed comparison with&nbsp;Fucus makes this correspondence at once apparent. In Fucus the&nbsp;contents of the female organ (oogonium), which is a single cell,&nbsp;divide into eight oospheres, which are subsequently fertilized ; in&nbsp;the Floridese there is, before fertilization, no differentiated oosphere,&nbsp;but the organ, as a whole, is fertilized by the spermatium, and it&nbsp;is in this case after, and not before, fertilization, as in the case oí&nbsp;Fucus, that a ]irocess of cell-formation takes place in the female&nbsp;organ ; hence the reproductive cells formed by the fertilized female&nbsp;organ of the Floridese are at once fertile, and correspond to the&nbsp;fertilized oospheres (oospores) of Fucus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The peculiarities of the sexual reproduction of some of the Floridese are of sufficient general interest to be mentioned here.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the Coralline», according to Solms-Laubach, the procarpia are produced several together in a conceptacle ; it is, however, only&nbsp;the central procarpia of the group which are capable of being&nbsp;fertilized, and the peripheral procarpia which produce carpospores.&nbsp;After the fertilization of the central procarpia, the carpogenous&nbsp;cells of the whole of the procarpia fuse together to form one large&nbsp;cell from the periphery of which the carpospores are produced by&nbsp;budding.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">This physiological division of labour is more marked in Dud-resnaya, and a few other Florideae. In these plants some of the procarpia are destitute of a trichogyne, whereas others possess that&nbsp;organ. The spermatia fertilize those procarpia which possess a&nbsp;trichogyne, but these procarpia do not produce carpospores; but&nbsp;there grow out from them filaments which fertilize the procarpia&nbsp;destitute of a trichogyne, and these then give rise to carpospores.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The development of the carpospores in the Bangiaceae (Bangia, Porphyra) is peculiar. The carpogenous cell does not in this case,&nbsp;as in other Floridese, produce spores by budding, but its protoplasm divides into eight portions ; these are set free as naked&nbsp;masses of protoplasm, which move about for a time in an amoeboid&nbsp;manner and then come to rest and surroimd themselves with a cell-wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In some of the higher Algse, namely, in the Sphacelarieae and in the Laminariese, families belonging to the Phaeosporeae, no sexual&nbsp;process has been observed as yet; but, as our knowledge of the&nbsp;life-history of these plants is imperfect, it cannot be definitely&nbsp;stated at present that they are entirely asexual.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In the somewhat aberrant group of the Conjugatae the sexual process is peculiar. Iu the Desmidiese and the Mesocarpeae it is&nbsp;effected in this way, that two adjacent cells, belonging usually to&nbsp;different filaments, throw out corresponding lateral protuberances&nbsp;which meet, and, the intervening walls being absorbed, form a&nbsp;canal placing the cavities of the two cells in direct communication ;&nbsp;the protoplasm of each cell contracts, forming an aplanogamete,&nbsp;and travels into the canal, where the two masses meet and fuse.&nbsp;This is clearly a process of conjugation, similar to that of planogametes, and the product is likewise a single cell which is termed&nbsp;a zygospore. In the Zygnemeae, of which Spirogyra is a familiar&nbsp;example, the process is slightly different. Here the protoplasm of&nbsp;one of the two conjugating organs contracts first and passes over&nbsp;into the cavity of the other, there to fuse with its protoplasm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Turning now to the Fungi, we find that in the simplest forms (Scliizomycetes, Saccharomycetes) there is no trace of sexual&nbsp;reproduction, whereas in the higher forms, with some exceptions,&nbsp;sexual reproductive organs are present, though they are in many&nbsp;cases functionless.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
