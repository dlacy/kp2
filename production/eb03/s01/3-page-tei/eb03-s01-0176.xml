Bruce omitted nothing for his defence. He had always been conſidered by his countrymen as a promiſing accompliſhed young nobleman, but firmly attached to Edward’s perſon and government; ſor which reaſon he had not been truſted by thoſe independent patriots who joined Wallace. But their confidence was now gained by his rendering himſelf ſo obnoxious to Edward, that no poſſibility of a reconciliation was left; and he ſoon ſaw himſelf at the head of a ſmall army. With theſe, who conſiſted of raw and unexperienced ſoldiers, Bruce formed a camp at Methven near Perth, which laſt was the head-quarters of the enemy; but knowing the diſadvantage under which he laboured from the inexperience of his men, he reſolved to act upon the defenſive. The Engliſh general at laſt ſent Bruce a challenge to fight him, which was accepted; but the day before the battle was to have been fought by agreement, the Scots were attacked by ſurpriſe, and totally defeated. Bruce behaved with the greateſt valour, and had three horſes killed under him. Being known by the ſlaughter which he made, John Mowbray, a man of great courage and reſolution, ruſhed upon him, and catching hold of his horſe’s bridle, cried out, “I have hold of the new- made king!” but he was delivered by Chriſtopher Seaton. Some Scottiſh hiſtorians have aſſerted, that on this occaſion all the priſoners of note were put to death; but others inform us, that though Edward did ſend orders to that purpoſe, the Engliſh general pardoned all thoſe who were willing to ſwear fealty to his maſter: however, it is certain, that after the battle of Methven, many priſoners were hanged and quartered.</p><p>This diſaſter almoſt gave the finiſhing ſtroke to the affairs of Bruce. He now found himſelf deſerted by a great part of his army. The Engliſh had taken priſoners great numbers of women whoſe huſhands followed Bruce; and all thoſe were now ordered, on pain of death, to accompany their huſhands. Thus was Bruce burdened with a number of uſeleſs mouths, and found it hard to ſubſiſt. The conſequence was, that moſt of his men departed with their families, ſo that in a few days his army dwindled down to 500<hi rend="italic">.</hi> With theſe he retreated to Aberdeen, where he was met by his brother Sir Neil, his wife, and a number of other ladies, all of whom offered to follow his fortune through every difficulty. But, however heroic this behaviour might be, it put Bruce to ſome inconvenience, as he could ſcarce procure ſubſiſtence; and therefore he perſuaded the ladies to retire to his caſtle of Kildrommey, under the protection of Sir Neil Bruce and the Earl of Athol. In the mean time the deſertion among Bruce’s troops continued, ſo that now he had with him no more than 200 men; and as winter was coming on, he reſolved to go into Argyleſhire, where Sir Neil Campbell's eſtate lay, who had gone before to prepare for his reception. In his way thither he encountered incredible difficulties; and ſome of his followers being cut off at a place called <hi rend="italic">Dalry,</hi> the reſt were ſo diſheartened, that they all forſook him, excepting Sir Gilbert Hay, Sir James (ſometimes called Lord) Douglas, and a few domeſtics. Bruce, however, kept up the ſpirits of his little party by recounting to them the adventures of princes and patriots in circumſtances ſimilar to his own. Having croſſed Lochlomond in a ſmall crazy boat, he was discovered by his truſty friend the Earl of Lenox, who had been proſcribed in England, and now lived in a kind of exile on his own eſtate. The meeting between theſe friends was very affecting, and drew tears from the eyes of all preſent. Lenox, who had heard nothing of Bruce’s misfortunes, furniſhed him and his half-famiſhed attendants with plenty of proviſions: but being ſoon made ſenſible that it was impoſſible for them to live in a place where they were well known, and ſurrounded by enemies, Bruce reſolved to ſeek out ſome more ſafe habitation. For this purpoſe Sir Neil Campbell had already provided ſhipping; but our adventurers had ſcarcely ſet ſail, when they were purſued by a large ſquadren of the enemy’s fleet. The bark which carried the carl of Lenox eſcaped with the utmoſt difficulty to Cantire, where Bruce was already landed: and, at their meeting, both agreed that their perſons ſhould never afterwards be ſeparated while they remained alive.</p><p>In the mean time Edward having compromiſed ſome differences with his Engliſh ſubjects, reſumed his old project of entirely ſubduing Scotland; and his intention now appears to have been to divide the lands of ſuch as he ſuſpected of diſaffection among his Engliſh followers. He ordered a proclamation to be made, that all who had any title to the honour of knighthood, either by heritage or eſtate, ſhould repair to Weſtminſter to receive all military ornaments, their horſes excepted, from his royal wardrobe. As the prince of Wales came under this denomination, he was the firſt who underwent the ceremony; which gave him a right to confer the like honour on the ſons of above 300 of the chief nobility and gentry of England. The prince then repaired, at the head of this gallant train, to Edward; who received them, ſurrounded by his nobility, in the moſt ſolemn manner. The king then made a ſpeech on the treachery of the Scots, whoſe entire deſtruction he vowed. He declared his reſolution of once more heading his army in perſon; and he deſired, in caſe of his death, that his body might be carried to Scotland, and not buried till ſignal vengeance was taken on the perfidious nation. Having then ordered all preſent to join him within fifteen days, with their attendants and military equipages, he prepared ſor his journey into Scotland. He entered the country ſoon after Bruce’s defeat at Methven. The army was divided into two bodies; one commanded by the king himſelf, the other by the prince of Wales, and, under him, by the earls of Lancaſter and Hereford, with orders to proceed northwards, and penetrate into the countries where the intereſt of Bruce was ſtrongeſt. As he paſſed along, Edward cauſed all that fell into his hands, whom be ſuſpected of favouring Bruce’s party, to be immediately executed. The biſhop of Glaſgow was the only exception to this barbarity; he was taken, but had his life ſpared on account of his function.</p><p>In the mean time, as the prince of Wales continued his march northwards, Bruce’s queen began to be alarmed for her own ſafety. She was adviſed to take ſanctuary at the ſhrine of St Duthac in Roſsſhire; but there ſhe was made priſoner by William earl of Roſs, who was of the Engliſh party. By Edward’s order ſhe was ſent to London; her daughter, who was taken at the ſame time, being ſhut up in a religious houſe. The</p></body></text></TEI>
