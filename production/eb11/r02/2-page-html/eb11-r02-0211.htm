<p><span class="font0">•systems, causing the formation of numerous lakes and of the waterfalls which determined the situation of many of the&nbsp;manufacturing cities of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the N.W. is Durfee Hill, which attains an elevation of 805 ft., and is the highest point within Rhode Island. The mean elevation&nbsp;for the entire state is 200 ft. The coast-line, including the shores&nbsp;of the bays and islands, is extensive; its western portion is only&nbsp;slightly indented, but its eastern portion is deeply indented by&nbsp;Narragansett Bay, a body of water varying in width from 3 to 12 m.,&nbsp;and extending inland for about 28 m. The land surface E. of this&nbsp;bay is very gently rolling, but to the W. it consists </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">a somewhat</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-right:solid;">
<p><span class="font1">more rugged upland which slopes gradually southward. Over the whole state there is a layer of drift deposited by the glaciers which&nbsp;once covered this region. This glacial material is in the form of&nbsp;a till or boulder clay, but in the lowlands, and especially along&nbsp;Narragansett Bay, it is generally overlaid by stratified drift deposited by glacial streams. Within Narragansett Bay are the&nbsp;numerous islands characteristic of an area which has suffered comparatively recent depression, the largest being Rhode Island (or&nbsp;Aquidneck), Conanicut Island and Prudence Island. Of these the&nbsp;most important is Rhode Island, 15 m. long and 3 m. wide, which has&nbsp;given the state its name. Lying about 10 m. off the coast and S.&nbsp;of the central part of the state is Block Island, a sandy tract 6 </span><span class="font0">m.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">long and from 1 to 4 m. wide, with a rolling surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rivers of the state are short and of no great volume, but they flow swiftly and are useful in supplying power for manu</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">factories. The Providence river is really an arm of Narragansett Bay, into which flow the waters of the Pawtuxet and the Black-stone rivers. The latter stream at Pawtucket has a fall of about&nbsp;50 ft., and the Pawtuxet river also has a number of falls along&nbsp;its course. Mount Hope Bay is a north-eastern arm of Narragan-sett Bay, and is also the estuai^ of the Taunton river. The Sakon-net river is a long bay separating Aquidneck or Rhode Island from&nbsp;the mainland on the E. The Pawcatuck river is the largest stream&nbsp;in the western half of the state, and along the lower part of its&nbsp;course it forms the boundary between Rhode Island and Connecticut.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fauna and Flora.—</span><span class="font1">The fauna of the state does not differ from that of southern Connecticut and eastern&nbsp;Massachusetts. The marine fauna is of economic&nbsp;importance. The woodland area of the state&nbsp;has been estimated (census of 1900) at 400&nbsp;sq. m., or about 37% of the land area, but the&nbsp;trees are generally too small for timber. The&nbsp;most common varieties of trees are the oak,&nbsp;walnut and chestnut. There are a few stretches&nbsp;of pine forest, and in the S. the swamps are&nbsp;sometimes overgrown with cedar.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">’Climate.—</span><span class="font1">Rhode Island has a more moderate climate than that of the northern sections of&nbsp;New England. There are no great extremes&nbsp;of either heat or cold, and a number of the&nbsp;towns and cities, especially Newport and Nar-ragansett Pier, have become noted summer&nbsp;resorts. Narragansett Pier has a mean annual&nbsp;temperature of 49°, a mean summer temperature (for June, July and August) of 68°, and a&nbsp;mean winter temperature (for December,&nbsp;January and February) of 29°. The mean&nbsp;annual temperature at Providence is 50°; the&nbsp;mean for the summer, 72°; and for the winter,&nbsp;30°; while the highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded are respectively 102<sup>0</sup> and&nbsp;-9<sup>0</sup>. The mean annual rainfall is about 50 in.,&nbsp;ranging from 47-4 in. at Narragansett Pier to&nbsp;53-2 in. at Kingston.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Soils.—</span><span class="font1">The boulder clay or “ hard pan ” of which most of the surface lands are composed,&nbsp;forms a very indifferent support for vegetation, and consequently the state is not well&nbsp;adapted for the growing of crops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agriculture.—</span><span class="font1">The acreage of improved farm land in Rhode lsland decreased from 356,487&nbsp;in 1850 to 137,354 in 1900, but the value of&nbsp;farm property (including land with improvements, implements, machinery and live stock)&nbsp;increased in the same period from $ 19,100,640&nbsp;to $26,989,189. The number of farms remained&nbsp;about the same—5385 in 1850 and 5498 in&nbsp;1900; but the average area decreased from&nbsp;ΙΟ2-9 acres to 82-9 acres. The value of farm&nbsp;products increased from $3,670,135 in 1879 to&nbsp;$6,333,864 in 1899. The average value of farms&nbsp;increased from $3547 in 1850 to $4909 in 1900.&nbsp;The number of persons engaged in agricultural&nbsp;pursuits in 1880 was 10,986, and in 1900,&nbsp;10,957.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The total acreage of cereals (barley, buckwheat, Indian corn, oats, rye and wheat) decreased from 19,575 acres in 1870 to 10,552 acres in 1899, and the total product of these&nbsp;crops decreased from 801,111 bu. in 1849 to&nbsp;350,110 bu. in 1899.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The total number of neat cattle on farms decreased from 36,262 in 1850 to 30,696 in&nbsp;1900, but the number of dairy cows increased&nbsp;from 18,698 to 23,660.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fisheries.—</span><span class="font1">Whaling was an established industry in Rhode Island as [early as 1723, and in 1731 the colonial assembly provided&nbsp;a bounty of five shillings a barrel for whale oil, and a penny a pound&nbsp;for whalebone. About 1750 sperm candles were first manufactured.&nbsp;In 1846 about 50 whaling vessels sailed from Rhode Island ports;&nbsp;but by the close of the century the industry had become practically&nbsp;extinct. In 1905 the number of persons employed in the general&nbsp;fisheries industry was 2212 ; and the value of the catch was&nbsp;$1,546,658, the largest items being: lobsters, $64,358; squeteague&nbsp;(weakfish), $86,478; scup, $138,030; and oysters (for market),&nbsp;$874,232.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Minerals.—</span><span class="font1">Rhode Island’s mineral wealth is relatively slight. The total value @@<sup>1</sup> of all the mineral products of the state in 1907&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="text-decoration:underline;">was $937,384, and in 1908, $708,694, and of these totals granite</span></p>
