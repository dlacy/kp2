<p><span class="font1">town with the suburb of Ehingen, 7 m. by rail S.W. of Tübingen. Pop. (1905) 7554. It is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop,&nbsp;and possesses the fine Gothic cathedral of St Martin; several&nbsp;other churches; an old castle now used as a prison; and a&nbsp;building, formerly a Jesuit monastery and now the residence&nbsp;of the bishop. The chief industries are the manufacture of&nbsp;machinery, screws, watches and beer, tanning and the cultivation of fruit and hops. Rottenburg passed into the possession&nbsp;of Austria in 1281 and into that of Württemberg in 1805.&nbsp;Near the town are the remains of the Roman station of Sumalo-cenna or Salmulocenae.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROTTERDAM, a city of Holland in the province of South Holland, on both banks of the New Maas, at the confluence&nbsp;of the canalized Rotte, and a junction station 14! m. by rail&nbsp;S.S.E. of the Hague. Steam tramways connect it with Schiedam, and with Numansdorp on the south of the island of Beier-land, and there is a regular service of steamers by river and&nbsp;canal to Antwerp by way of the South Holland and Zeeland&nbsp;Islands and in every direction. The population of the city&nbsp;was.about 20,000 in 1632; 53,212 in 1796; 105,858 in i860;&nbsp;and 379,017 in 1905. Its shipping facilities have raised Rotterdam to the position of the first commercial city of Holland.&nbsp;By means of the New Waterway (1869-90) to the Hook of&nbsp;Holland it is accessible for the largest ships. The principal&nbsp;quay is the Boompjes (“ little trees ”), forming the riverfront on the north side. Although originally situated exclusively on the north or right bank of the Maas, in 1869 Rotterdam&nbsp;was extended to the southern shore by the acquisition of the&nbsp;commune of Feienoord; while in 1886 Delftshaven on the&nbsp;west, and in 1895 Charlois on the south-west and Krälingen on&nbsp;the east, were also incorporated. The river is spanned by a&nbsp;road bridge (1878) and a railway bridge (1877) passing from&nbsp;the Boompjes to the North Island, whence they are continued&nbsp;to the farther shore by swing-bridges through which the largest&nbsp;ships can pass to the upper river. These bridges prove useful&nbsp;in breaking up the ice which forms above them in winter. On&nbsp;the south side of the river are numerous large docks and&nbsp;wharves, while the city proper on the north side consists of a&nbsp;labyrinth of basins and canals with tree-bordered quays.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the centre of the town is the Beursplein, or Exchange Square, with the large general post office (1875), the&nbsp;“ Amicitia ” club, and the exchange itself (1723). Behind&nbsp;the exchange is the great market-place, built on vaulting over&nbsp;a canal, and containing a bronze statue of Erasmus, who was&nbsp;bom in Rotterdam in 1467. The statue is the work of Hendrik&nbsp;de Keyser, and was erected in 1622 (the inscription being&nbsp;added in 1677) to replace an older one. Beyond the marketplace is the High Street, which runs along the top of the Maas&nbsp;Dyke. On the west of the city a pretty road planted with&nbsp;trees and grass plots leads from the Zoological Gardens (1857),&nbsp;on the north to the small park overlooking the river. In the&nbsp;park is a statue of the popular poet Hendrik Tollens (d. 1856),&nbsp;a native of the city. Among the churches of Rotterdam are&nbsp;an English church, originally built by the ist duke of Marlborough, whose arms may be seen with the royal arms over&nbsp;the entrance. The Groote Kerk, or Laurens Kerk (end of the&nbsp;15th’century), contains a fine brass screen (1715), a celebrated&nbsp;organ with nearly 5000 pipes, and the monuments of Admirals&nbsp;Witte de Witte (d. 1658), Kortenaer (d. 1665), and van Brak el&nbsp;(d. 1690), and other Dutch naval heroes. The lofty tower&nbsp;commands an extensive view. In the New Market adjoining&nbsp;is a fountain adorned with sculptures erected in 1874 to commemorate the jubilee of the restoration of Dutch independence&nbsp;(1813). The museums of the city comprise an ethnographical&nbsp;museum, the maritime museum established by the Yacht&nbsp;Club in 1874, and the Boyman’s Museum (1867) containing&nbsp;pictures, drawings and engravings, as well as the town library.&nbsp;Of the original collection of pictures bequeathed by F. J. 0.&nbsp;Boyman in 1847, more than half was destroyed by fire in 1864;&nbsp;but the collection has been enlarged since and is representative&nbsp;of both ancient and modem artists. Close to the museum&nbsp;is a statue of the statesman Gysbert Karel van Hogendorp&nbsp;(1762-1834), a native of the city. Among the remaining&nbsp;buildings must be mentioned the town hall (17th century;&nbsp;restored 1823), the court-house, the concert-hall of the “ Harmonic ” club, the record office (1900), the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leeskabuiet\</span><span class="font1"> or subscription library and reading-rooms, and the ten-storeyed&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Witte Huis</span><span class="font1"> (1897), which is used for offices and is one of the&nbsp;highest private buildings on the Continent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The industries comprise the manufacture of tobacco, cigars, margarine, rope, leather, &amp;c., and there are breweries, distilleries and sugar refineries. The gas, electricity (1894) and&nbsp;waterworks (1870) are under municipal control. Shipbuilding&nbsp;yards extend above and below the city, one of the earliest&nbsp;being that of the Netherlands Steamboat Company (1825).&nbsp;It is, however, as a commercial rather than as a manufacturing city that Rotterdam is distinguished, its progress in this&nbsp;respect having been very striking. Between 1850 and 1902&nbsp;the area of canals and docks in use on both sides of the river&nbsp;increased from 96 to over 300* acres, about £2,000,000 having&nbsp;been spent on the building of docks in the last quarter of the&nbsp;17th century. Besides its maritime trade Rotterdam has an&nbsp;extensive river traffic, not only with Holland, but also with&nbsp;Belgium and Germany. Its overseas trade is principally&nbsp;with the Dutch colonies, New York, La Plata and the east&nbsp;and west coasts of Africa. The great harbour works on the&nbsp;south side of the river required to accommodate this growing&nbsp;trade were planned by the engineer Stieltjes (d. 1878),&nbsp;who has a monument on the North Island. Besides being&nbsp;easily accessible from the river and connected with the railways, the docks are provided with every facility for coaling&nbsp;and loading or discharging cargoes. The larger passenger&nbsp;steamers of the Rotterdamsche Lloyd to Netherlands India&nbsp;and of the Holland-American Steamship Company (the two&nbsp;principal passenger and cargo steamship companies at Rotterdam) have their berths on the south side of the river. In the&nbsp;centre of the river there is accommodation for over thirty&nbsp;vessels at the mooring buoys. The increase in the importance of Rotterdam as a port, apart from the development&nbsp;of the trade of the Netherlands generally, is shown by the&nbsp;fact that whereas in 1846 only 31% of the total trade of&nbsp;the country passed through the port, in 1883 the proportion was 50%; in the same year 43-75% of the total&nbsp;number of vessels engaged in Dutch trade used the port of&nbsp;Rotterdam, whereas in 1850 the proportion was only 35-77%.&nbsp;The average number of all vessels using the port annually&nbsp;during the decade 1897-1906 was 7228 of 11,163,624 tons, but&nbsp;a steady increase was recorded during this period, from 6212&nbsp;ships of 8,434,032 tons in 1897 to 8570 ships of 14,572,246 tons&nbsp;in 1906.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rotterdam probably owes its existence to two castles, which existed in feudal times. In 1299 John I., count of Holland,&nbsp;granted to the people of Rotterdam the same rights as were&nbsp;enjoyed by the burghers of Beverwijk, which were identical&nbsp;with those of Haarlem (K. Hegel, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Städte und Gilden,</span><span class="font1"> 1891,&nbsp;Bd. ii.). This privilege marks the origin of the town. In 1489&nbsp;it was surprised by Francis van Brederode, and in 1572 it was&nbsp;plundered by the Spaniards, who were in possession for four&nbsp;months. It continued to increase in size, various extensions&nbsp;of its boundaries being made, and its trading importance is&nbsp;to a large extent the result of its commercial intercourse with&nbsp;England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROTTWEIL, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Württemberg, lying on a hill on the left bank of the Neckar, 46 m. S.W. of Tübingen by rail. Pop. (1905) 9008. It is partly surrounded&nbsp;by walls, and contains two fine churches, the Gothic Heilige-Kreuz-kirche, built in the 14th century and restored in 1840,&nbsp;and the Capellen-kirqhe with a Gothic spire 230 ft. high. It&nbsp;has a medieval town hall, several schools and a museum of&nbsp;antiquities. Especially noteworthy is the collection of sculptures and pictures of old German art in the chapel of St Lawrence, where there is also a Roman mosaic, found </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">the vicinity,&nbsp;portraying Orpheus in the centre and, at the sides, Roman&nbsp;chariot-races and gladiators.
