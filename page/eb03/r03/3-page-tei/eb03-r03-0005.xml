This is prevented by the tie-beam, and this excites a preſſure, by which they tend to compreſs each other. Suppoſe them without weight, and that a great weight is laid on the ridge B. This can be ſupported only by the butting of the rafters in their own directions A B and C B, and the weight tends to compreſs them in the oppoſite directions, and, through their intervention,, to ſtretch the tie-beam. If neither the rafters can be compreſſed, nor the tie-beam ſtretched, it is plain that the triangle ABC muſt retain its ſhape, and that B becomes a fixed point, very proper to be uſed as a point of ſuſpenſion. To this point, therefore, is the tie-beam ſuſpended by means of the king-poſt. A common ſpectator, unacquainted with carpentry, view's it very differently, and the tie-beam appears to him to carry the roof. The king-poſt appears a pillar reſting on the beam, wdιereas it is really a ſtring ; and an iron-rod of one-ſixteenth of the ſize would have done juſt as well. The king-poſt is ſometimes mortiſed into the tie-beam, and pins put through the joint, which gives it more the look of a pillar with the roof reſting on it. This does well enough in many cafes. But the beſt method is to connect them by an iron ſtrap, like a ſtirrup, which is bolted at its upper ends into the king-poſt, and paſſes round the tie-beam. In this way a ſpace is commonly left between the end of the king-poſt and the upper ſide of the tie-beam. Here the beam plainly appears hanging in the ſtirrup ; and this method allows us to reſtore the beam to an exact level, when it has funk by the unavoidable compreſſion or other yielding of the parts. The holes in the ſides of the iron ſtrap are made oblong inſtead of round ; and the bolt which is drawn through all is made to taper on the under fide; ſo that driving it farther draws the 'tie-beam upwards. A notion of this may be formed by looking at fig. 16. which is a ſection of the poſt and beam.</p><p>It requires conſiderable attention, however, to make this ſuſpenſion of the tie-beam ſuſſiciently firm. The top of the king-poſt is cut into the form of the arch-ſtone of a bridge, and the heads of the rafters are firm-'ly mortiſed into this projecting part. Theſe projections are called joggles, and are formed by working the king-poſt out of a much larger piece of timber, and cutting off the unneceffary wood from the two ſides ; and, left all this ſhould not be ſuſſicient, it is uſual in great works to add an iron-plate or ſtrap of three branches, wſhich are bolted into the heads of the king-poſt and rafters.</p><p>The rafters, though not ſo long as the beam, ſeem to ſtand as much in need of ſomething to prevent their bending, for they carry the weight of the covering.— This cannot be done by ſuſpenſion, for we have no fixed points above them : But we have now got a very firm point of ſupport at the foot of the king-poſt.— <hi rend="italic">Braces,</hi>  or<hi rend="italic">firuts,</hi>  ED, ED, (fig. 17.), are put under the" middle of the rafters, where they are ſlightly mortiſed, and their lower ends are firmly mortiſed into joggles formed on the foot of the king-poſt. As theſe braces are very powerful in their reſiſtance to compreſe ſion, and the king-poſt equally ſo to refill extenſion, the points E and F may be conſidered as fixed ; and the rafters being thus reduced to half their former length, have now four times their former relative ſtrength.</p><p>Roofs do not always conſiſt of two ſloping ſides meeting in a ridge. They have ſometimes a flat on the top, with two ſloping ſides. They are ſometimes formed with a double ſlope, and are called <hi rend="italic">kirb</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">manſarde roofs.</hi>  They ſometimes have a valley in the middle, and are then called M roofs. Such roofs require another piece which may be called the <hi rend="italic">trufs beam</hi>  becauſe all ſuch frames are called <hi rend="italic">truffes,</hi>  probably from the French word <hi rend="italic">trouſfe,</hi>  becauſe ſuch roofs are like portions of plain roofs, <hi rend="italic">trouſſes</hi>  or ſhortened.</p><p>A flat-topped roof is thus conſtructed. Suppoſe the three rafters AB, BC, CD (fig. 18.) of which AB and CD are equal, and BC horizontal. It is plain that they will be in equilibrio, and the roof have no tendency to go to either fide. The tie-beam AD withſtands the horizontal thruſts of the whole frame, and the two rafters AB and CD are each preſſed in their own directions in conſequence of their butting with the middle rafter or truſs-beam BC. It lies between them like the keyſtone of an arch. They lean towards it, and it reſts on them. The preſſure which the truſs-beam and its load excites on the two rafters is the very ſame as if the rafters were produced till they meet in G, and a weight were laid on theſe equal to that of BC and its load. If therefore the truſs-beam is of a ſcantling ſuſſicient for carrying its own load, and withſtanding the compreſſion from the two rafters, the roof will be equally ſtrong (while it keeps its ſhape) as the plain roof AGD furniſhed with king-poſt and braces. We may conceive this another way. Suppoſe a plain roof AGD, without braces to ſupport the middle B and C of the rafters. Then let a beam BC be put in between the rafters, butting upon little notches cut in the rafters. It is evident that this muſt prevent the rafters from bending dowm-wards, becauſe the points B and C cannot deſcend, moving round the centres A and D, without ſhortening the diſtance BC between them. This cannot be without compreſſing the beam BC. It is plain that B C may be wedged in, or wedges driven in between its ends B and C and the notches in which it is lodged. Theſe wedges may be driven in till they even force out the rafters GA and GD. Whenever thi3 happens, all the mutual preſſure of the heads of theſe rafters at G is taken away, and the parts GB and GC may be cut away, and the roof ABCD will be as ſtrong as the roof AGD furniſhed with the king-poſt and braces, becauſe the truſs-beam gives a ſupport of the ſame kind at B and C as the brace would have done.</p><p>But this roof ABCD would have no firmneſs of ſhape. Any addition of weight on one ſide would de* ſtroy the equilibrium at the angle, would depreſs that angle, and cauſe the oppoſite one to riſe. To give it ſtiffneſs, it muſt either have ties or braces, or ſomething partaking of the nature of both. The uſual method of framing is to make the heads of the rafters butt on the joggles of two ſide-poſts BE and CF, while the truſs-beam, or ſtrut as it is generally termed by the carpenters, is mortiſed ſquare into the inſide ©f the heads. The lower ends E and F of the ſide-poſts are connected with the tie-beam either by mortiſes or ſtraps.</p><p>This conſtruction gives firmneſs to the frame ; for the angle B cannot deſcend in conſequence of any inequality of preſſure, without forcing the other angle C to riſe. This it cannot do, being held down by the poſt CF. And the ſame conſtruction fortifies the tie-beam, wſhich is now ſuſpended at the points E and F</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
