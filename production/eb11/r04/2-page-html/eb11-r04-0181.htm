            <p><span class="font1">The radiation from chromium cannot pass through more than a few
                    centimetres of air without being absorbed, while that from tin&nbsp;is as
                    penetrating as that given out by a fairly efficient Röntgen tube.&nbsp;Barkla
                    and Sadler found that the radiation characteristic of the metal&nbsp;is not
                    excited .unless the primary radiation is more penetrating than&nbsp;the
                    characteristic radiation. Thus the characteristic radiation from&nbsp;silver can
                    excite the characteristic radiation, from iron, but. the&nbsp;characteristic
                    radiation from iron cannot excite that from silver.&nbsp;We may compare this
                    result with Stokes’s rule for phosphorescence,&nbsp;that the phosphorescent
                    light is of longer wave-length than the&nbsp;light which excites it.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The discovery that each element gives out a characteristic
                    radiation (or, as still more recent work indicates, a line spectrum of
                    characteristic radiation) is one of the utmost importance. It gives us, for
                    example, the means of getting homogeneous Röntgen radiation of&nbsp;a perfectly
                    definite type: it is also of fundamental importance in&nbsp;connexion with any
                    theory of the Röntgen rays. We have seen&nbsp;that there is no evidence of
                    refraction of the Röntgen rays ; it would&nbsp;be interesting to try if this
                    were the case when the rays passing&nbsp;through the refracting substance are

            <p><span class="font1">The properties of the cathode rays excited by the radiation from
                    tin correspond very closely with those produced in a discharge&nbsp;tube when
                    the potential difference between the anode and cathode&nbsp;is about 30,000
                    volts. When Röntgen rays pass through a thin&nbsp;plate the cathodic radiation
                    on the side the rays emerge is more&nbsp;intense than on the side they enter.
                    Kaye </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Phil. Trans.
                    209,</span><span class="font1"> p. 123)&nbsp;has shown that when cathode rays
                    fall upon a metal two kinds of&nbsp;Röntgen rays are excited, one being the
                    characteristic radiation&nbsp;of the metal and the other a kind independent of
                    the nature of the&nbsp;metal and dependent only upon the velocity of the cathode
                    rays.&nbsp;The faster the cathode rays the harder the Röntgen rays they produce.
                    It would be interesting to see if there is any connexion&nbsp;between the
                    velocity of the cathode rays required to excite Röntgen&nbsp;rays as hard as
                    those given out say by tin and the velocity of the&nbsp;cathode rays which the
                    radiation from tin produces when it falls upon&nbsp;any metal. Sadler has shown
                    that metals can give off cathodic&nbsp;radiation even when the incident Röntgen
                    rays are too soft to&nbsp;excite the characteristic Röntgen radiation of the
                    metal, but that&nbsp;there is a large increase in the cathodic radiation as soon
                    as the&nbsp;characteristic Röntgen radiation is excited. It is possible
                    that&nbsp;the shock produced by the emission of these cathode
                    particles&nbsp;starts the vibrations which give rise to the characteristic
                    rays;&nbsp;the cathode particles emitted when the incident rays arc too
                    soft&nbsp;to excite the characteristic radiation coming from a different
                    source&nbsp;from those tapped by the hard rays.</span></p>

                    Rays.—</span><span class="font1">The wide variations in the penetrating power of
                    Röntgen rays from different sources is&nbsp;shown by the above table of the
                    penetrating power of the&nbsp;characteristic rays of the different elements.
                    Many experiments have been made on the penetration of the same rays
                    for&nbsp;different substances. It is a rule to which there is no
                    well-established exception that the greater the density of the substance the
                    greater is its power of absorbing the rays. The&nbsp;connexion, however, between
                    the absorption and the density&nbsp;of the substance is not in general a simple
                    one, though there is&nbsp;evidence that for exceedingly hard rays the absorption
                    is proportional to the density.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The power of any material to absorb rays is usually measured by a
                    coefficient λ, the definition of which is that a plate i/X

                    the other constituent. By the use of&nbsp;this principle we can find the value
                    of λ/D for the elements which&nbsp;cannot be obtained in a .free state. Benoist

                    values of λ/D are plotted against the&nbsp;atomic weight we get a smooth curve;
                    if we draw this curve it is&nbsp;evident that we have the means of determining
                    the atomic weight&nbsp;of an element by measuring its transparency to Röntgen
                    rays when&nbsp;in combination with elements whose transparency is known.
                    Benoist&nbsp;has applied this method to determine the atomic weight of
                    indium.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The value of λ/D for any one substance depends upon the type of
                    ray used, and the ratio of the values of λ/D for two substances&nbsp;may vary
                    very greatly with the type of ray; this is especially the&nbsp;case when one of
                    the substances is hydrogen. Thus Crowther&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"

                    1909) has shown that the ratio of X for air&nbsp;to X for hydrogen varied from
                    100 for rays given out by a Röntgen&nbsp;tube at a comparatively high pressure
                    when the rays were very&nbsp;soft to 5*56 when the pressure in the bulb was very
