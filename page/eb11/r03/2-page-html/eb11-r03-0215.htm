In the lower zone we find loosely composed groups&nbsp;of captives and Roman soldiers, some of whom are setting up&nbsp;a trophy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the supreme triumph of imperial jewelry is attained in the Great Cameo of the Bibliothèque Nationale. This is an&nbsp;Indian sardonyx cut in five layers, the largest extant example&nbsp;of its class. There is a marked advance on the Vienna cameo&nbsp;in composition; the lower zone is reduced to the proportions of&nbsp;an exergue, whilst heaven and earth are kept clearly apart in&nbsp;the main subject, yet at the same time united in a single picture.&nbsp;In the centre are the living members of the Julio-Claudian&nbsp;house—Tiberius and Livia enthroned, together with Gcrmanicus,&nbsp;his mother, and the rising generation—while above them hovers&nbsp;the deified Augustus, together with other deceased members&nbsp;of the family and an ideal figure in Phrygian garb bearing&nbsp;a globe, probably Iulus (Ascanius), or even Aeneas himself.&nbsp;The moment depicted is the departure of Gcrmanicus for&nbsp;the East in </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> 17, and amongst the figures of the central&nbsp;group we note the muse of history, bearing a scroll upon which&nbsp;to record the hero’s deeds, and a personification of Armenia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Engraved gems are not the only examples of Roman work in precious materials. Amongst the portraits of the first&nbsp;dynasty none is finer than a small head of Agrippina the younger&nbsp;(recently acquired by the British Museum) in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plasma</span><span class="font0"> (root-of-emerald), a material much used by Roman gem-cutters. Vases,&nbsp;again, were carved in precious stones, such as the famous onyx&nbsp;vase at Brunswick (Furtwängler, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die antiken Gemmen,</span><span class="font0"> figs.&nbsp;185-88), adorned with reliefs relating to the mysteries of&nbsp;Eleusis. A smaller, but finer, onyx vase in the Berlin Museum&nbsp;(Furtwängler, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">op. cit.,</span><span class="font0"> figs. 183, 184) represents the infancy of&nbsp;a prince of the Julian line—a rock surmounted by a small&nbsp;temple recalls the sculptures of the Ara Pacis, and the work&nbsp;seems to be of Augustan date.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was mentioned above that coloured glass was used as a substitute for gems, and it is to the school which produced the&nbsp;cameos of the early Empire that we owe the exquisite vases in&nbsp;white and blue glass) of which the Portland vase is the&nbsp;most famous example.@@<sup>1</sup> Pompeii furnishes a second in the&nbsp;amphora, decorated with vintage scenes, in the Naples&nbsp;Museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We must also class amongst the fine arts that of the die-sinker. Not only are the imperial portraits found on coins worthy of a place beside the works of the sculptor, but in&nbsp;the “ medallions ” of the 2nd century </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> we find figure-subjects, often recalling those of contemporary reliefs, treated&nbsp;with the utmost delicacy and finish.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of the purely industrial arts it is unnecessary to speak at length. The finds made in Gaul, Germany and Britain have&nbsp;enabled archaeologists to trace their history—particularly&nbsp;that of 'pottery—in some detail; but the chief importance&nbsp;of these discoveries lies in the fact that they prove the gradual&nbsp;diffusion of artistic talent throughout the provinces. In the&nbsp;last century of the republic a flourishing manufacture of red-glazed pottery was established with its chief centre at Arretium&nbsp;(Arezzo); the signatures of the vases enable us to distinguish&nbsp;a number of workshops owned by Romans who employed&nbsp;Greek or Oriental workmen. The repertory of decorative&nbsp;types used by these humble artists reflects the cross-currents&nbsp;of classicism and naturalism which were contending in the&nbsp;decadence of Hellenistic art; but, if we .cannot set a high&nbsp;substantive value on their works, it is important to note that&nbsp;in the ist century </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font0"> the Italian fabrics were gradually&nbsp;driven out of the market by those of Gaul, where the industry&nbsp;took root in the Cevennes and the valleys of the Rhone and&nbsp;the Allier; and before long north-eastern Gaul and the&nbsp;Rhineland became centres of production in the various minor</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">arts,@@ which continued to flourish until the .breakdown of the imperial system in the 3rd and 4th centuries </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(6) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Summary: the Place of Roman Art in History.—</span><span class="font0">Just as the establishment of the Roman Empire gave a political unity&nbsp;to the ancient world, and the acceptance of Christianity by&nbsp;its rulers assured the triumph of a universal religion, so the&nbsp;growth of a Graeco-Roman nationality, due to the freedom&nbsp;of intercourse between the subjects of the emperors, led to a&nbsp;unity of culture which found expression in the art of the time.&nbsp;Yet no sooner was the fusion of the elements which contributed&nbsp;to the new culture complete than the process of disruption&nbsp;began, which issued in the final separation of the Eastern&nbsp;from the Western Empire. In the first, the oriental factors,&nbsp;which produced a gradual transformation in Graeco-Roman&nbsp;art, definitely triumphed; and the result is seen in Byzantine&nbsp;art. But in the West it was otherwise. The realism native&nbsp;to Italy remained alive in spite of the conventions imposed&nbsp;upon it; the human interest asserted itself against the decorative. The Christian art of the West, therefore, is the true&nbsp;heir of the Roman, and, through the Roman, of the classical&nbsp;tradition. The mosaics of S. Maria Maggiore, already referred&nbsp;to, show how strongly this tradition was at work in the ist&nbsp;century of the Christian Empire; and monuments of the&nbsp;5th century </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.,</span><span class="font0"> such as the consular diptychs of ivory and&nbsp;the carved doors of S. Sabina at Rome, tell the same tale.&nbsp;As we have seen, Roman art in its specific quality was an&nbsp;historical art; and it was for this reason eminently fitted for&nbsp;the service of an historical religion. The earliest Christian&nbsp;art whose remains are preserved is that of the catacombs;&nbsp;and this is not only devoid of technical merit, but is also&nbsp;dominated by a single idea, which governs the selection of&nbsp;subjects—that of deliverance from the grave and its terrors,&nbsp;whether this be conveyed by scriptural types or by representations of Paradise and its dwellers? Not until the church’s&nbsp;triumph was complete could she command the services of the&nbsp;highest art and unfold her sacred story on the walls of her&nbsp;basilicas; but, when the time came, the monumental art&nbsp;created by the demands of imperial pride was ready to minister&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ad majorem gloriam Dei.</span></p>
