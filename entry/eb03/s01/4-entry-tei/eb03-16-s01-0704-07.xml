(Chriſtopher), an eminent hiſtory. painter, born at Ingolſtadt in 1550, who was diftinguiſhed by the appellation of the <hi rend="italic">German Raphael.</hi> He learned the firſt principles of the art in his own country, but finiſhed his ſtudies at Venice; when he not only made the works of Titian his models, but had the advantage of receiving ſome perſonal inſtructions from that illuſtrious matter. His performances were ſoon in the higheſt eſteem, as his manner of painting was very different from what the Germans had been accuſtomed to before that time: he was, therefore, invited by the elector of Bavaria to his court, and appointed his principal painter. He died in 1594; and his moſt capital works, as well in freſco as in oil, are in the palace at Munich, and in the churches and convents.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
