(Fr. <hi rend="italic">Sarreguemines),</hi> an industrial town and railway junction of Germany, in the imperial province of Alsace-Lorraine, is situated at the confluence</p><p>of the Blies and the Saar, 40 miles east of Metz. It carries on considerable manufactures of silk, plush, porcelain, and earthenware, and is a chief depot for the papier-maché boxes (mostly snuff-boxes) which are made in great quantity in the neighbourhood. To the south lies the district lunatic asylum of Steinbacherhof. The town, which is garrisoned by four squadrons of cavalry, in 1880 had a population of 9573, chiefly Roman Catholics.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
