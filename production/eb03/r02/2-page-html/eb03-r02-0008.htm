<p><span class="font0">RHUMB, in navigation, a vertical circle of any given place, or interſection of ſuch a circle with the horizon ; in which laſt ſenſe rhumb is the ſame with a point of the compaſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">RHUMB-Line</span><span class="font0"> is alſo uſed for the line which a ſhip de-ſcribes when ſailing in the ſame collateral point of the compaſs, or oblique to the meridians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RHUS, sumach, in botany : A genus of the tri-g∙ynia order, belonging to the pentandria claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 43d order,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dumoſ</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">æ</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">.</span><span class="font0"> The calyx is quinquepartite; the petals five;&nbsp;the berry monoſpermous. There are 24 ſpecies, of&nbsp;which the moſt remarkable are,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">The coriaria, or elm-leaved ſumach, grows naturally in Italy, Spain, Turkey, Syria, and Paleſtine.&nbsp;The branches of this tree are uſed inſtead of oak-bark&nbsp;for tanning of leather ; and it is ſaid that the Turkey&nbsp;leather is all tanned with this ſhrub. It has a ligneous&nbsp;ftalk, which divides at bottom into many irregular&nbsp;branches, riling to the height of eight or ten feet ; the&nbsp;bark is hairy, of an herbaceous brown colour; the leaves&nbsp;are winged, compoſed of ſeven or eight pair of lobes,&nbsp;terminated by an odd one, bluntly ſawed on their edges,&nbsp;hairy on their under ſide, of a yellowiſh-green colour,&nbsp;and placed alternately on the branches; the flowers&nbsp;grow in looſe panicles on the end of the branches,&nbsp;which are of a vchitiſh herbaceous colour, each panicle&nbsp;being compoſed of ſeveral ſpikes of flowers fitting cloſe&nbsp;to the footſtalks. The leaves and feeds of this ſort are&nbsp;uſed in medicine, and are eſteemed very reſtringent and&nbsp;ftiptic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The typhinum, Virginian ſumach, or vinegar plant,&nbsp;grows naturally in almoſt every part of North America.&nbsp;This hath a woody ſtem, with many irregular branches,&nbsp;which are generally crooked and deformed. The young&nbsp;branches are covered with a ſoft velvet-like down, re-ſembling greatly that of a young flag’s horn, both in&nbsp;colour and texture, from whence the common people&nbsp;have given it the appellation of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſtag's horn ;</span><span class="font0"> the leaves&nbsp;are winged, compoſed of fix or ſeven pair of oblong&nbsp;heart-ſhaped lobes, terminated by an odd one, ending&nbsp;in acute points, hairy on their underſide, as is alſo the&nbsp;midrib. The flowers are produced in cloſe tufts at the&nbsp;end of the branches, and are ſucceeded by feeds, inclo-ſed in purple woolly ſucculent covers ; ſo that the&nbsp;bunches are of a beautiful purple colour in autumn ;&nbsp;and the leaves, before they fall in autumn, change to a&nbsp;purpliſh colour at firſt, and before they fall to a feuille-mort. This plant, originally a native of North America, has been long cultivated in the north of Germany,&nbsp;and is lately introduced into Ruſſia. It has got the&nbsp;name of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vinegar plant</span><span class="font0"> from the double reaſon of the&nbsp;young germen of its fruit, when fermented, producing&nbsp;either new or adding to the ſtrength of old weak vinegar, whilſt its ripe berries afford an agreeable acid, which&nbsp;might ſupply the place when neceſſary of the citric acid.&nbsp;The powerful aſtringency of this plant in all its parts&nbsp;recommends it as uſeful in ſeveral of the arts. As for&nbsp;example, the ripe berries boiled with alum make a good&nbsp;dye for hats. The plant in all its parts may be uſed&nbsp;as a ſuccedaneum for oak-bark in tanning, eſpecially the&nbsp;white glove leather. It will likewiſe anſwer to prepare&nbsp;a dye for black, green, and yellow colours ; and with&nbsp;martial vitriol it makes a good ink. The milky juice</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">that flows from inciſions made in the trunk or branches, makes when dried the baſis of a varniſh little inferior&nbsp;to the Chineſe. Bees are remarkably fond of its flowers;&nbsp;and it affords more honey than any of the flowering&nbsp;ſlrrubs, ſo that it may prove a uſeful branch of economy, where rearing tlieſe infects is an object. The natives of America uſe the dried leaves as tobacco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The glabrum, with winged leaves, grows naturally&nbsp;in many parts of North America ; this is commonly&nbsp;titled by the gardeners </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New England ſumach.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;ſtem of this is ſtronger and riſes higher than that of the&nbsp;former ; the branches ſpread more horizontally ; they&nbsp;are not quite ſo downy as thoſe of the laſt, and the&nbsp;down is of a browniſh colour ; the leaves are compoſed&nbsp;of many more pair of lobes, which are ſmooth on both&nbsp;ſides ; the flowers are diſpoſed in looſe panicles, which&nbsp;are of an herbaceous colour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Carolinian um, with ſawedwinged leaves, grows&nbsp;naturally in Carolina ; the feeds of this were brought&nbsp;from thence by the late Mr Cateſhy, who has given a&nbsp;figure of the plant in his Natural Hiſtory of Carolina.&nbsp;This is by the gardeners called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſcarlet Carolina ſu-mach ;</span><span class="font0"> it riſes commonly to the height of ſeven or eight&nbsp;feet, dividing into many irregular branches, which are&nbsp;ſmooth, of a purple colour, and pounced over with a&nbsp;greyiſh powder, as are alſo the footſtalks of the leaves.&nbsp;The leaves are compoſed of ſeven or eight pair of lobes,&nbsp;terminated by an odd one ; theſe are not always placed&nbsp;exactly oppoſite on the midrib, but are ſometimes alternate. The upper ſide of the lobes are of a dark&nbsp;green, and their under hoary,, but ſmooth. The&nbsp;flowers are produced at the end of the branches in very&nbsp;cloſe panicles, which are large, and of a bright red&nbsp;colour.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Canadenſe, with winged ſpear-ſhaped leaves,&nbsp;grows naturally in Canada, Maryland, and ſeveral other&nbsp;parts of North America. This hath ſmooth branches&nbsp;of a purple colour, covered with a grey pounce. The&nbsp;leaves are compoſed of ſeven or eight pair of lobes, terminated by an odd one ; the lobes are ſpear-ſhaped,&nbsp;ſawed on their edges, of a lucid green on their upper&nbsp;ſurface, but hoary on their under, and are ſmooth.&nbsp;The flowers are produced at the end of the branches&nbsp;in large panicles, which are compoſed of ſeveral ſmaller,&nbsp;each ſtanding upon ſeparate footſtalks ; they are of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">deep red colour, and the whole panicle is covered&nbsp;with a grey pounce, as if it had been ſcattered over&nbsp;them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The copallinum, or narrow-leaved ſumach, grows&nbsp;naturally in moſt parts of North America, where it is&nbsp;known by the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">beach ſumach,</span><span class="font0"> probably from the&nbsp;place where it grows. This is of humbler growth than&nbsp;either, of the former, ſeldom riſing more than four or&nbsp;five feet high in Britain, dividing into many ſpreading&nbsp;branches, which are ſmooth, of a light brown colour,&nbsp;cloſely garniſhed with winged leaves, compoſed of four&nbsp;or five pair of narrow lobes, terminated by an odd one;&nbsp;they are of a light green on both ſides, and in autumn&nbsp;change purpliſh. The midrib, which ſuſtains the lobes,&nbsp;has on each ſide a winged or leafy border, which runs&nbsp;from one pair of lobes to another, ending in joints at&nbsp;each pair, by which it is eaſily diſtinguiſhed from the&nbsp;other ſorts. The flowers are produced in looſe panicles at the end of the branches, of a yellowiſh herbaceous colour.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
