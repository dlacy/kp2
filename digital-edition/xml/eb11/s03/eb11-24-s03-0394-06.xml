E. of Frankfort-on-Oder by the railway to Posen. Pop. (1905) 9321. It is still in part surrounded by its medieval wall, and has an old market-place, a castle and many old houses. Velvet, cloth, machinery, bricks and candles arc manufactured, and there are flour-mills, breweries, distilleries and lignite mines. The territory of Schwiebus originally belonged to the principality of Glogau, and in the 16th and 17th centuries was a bone of contention between the electors of Brandenburg and the emperors. A compromise was arrived at in 1686, by which the elector received the lordship of Schwiebus on renouncing his claims to the principalities of Liegnitz, Brieg and Wohlau. The electoral prince Frederick, afterwards the elector Frederick III., had, however, in a private compact pledged himself to restore Schwiebus to the emperor Leopold I. when he became elector, and he did so in 1695, receiving Â£40,000 in exchange. By the peace of 1742, Frederick the Great regained Schwiebus with the rest of Silesia, and it was incorporated with the department of Glogau.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
