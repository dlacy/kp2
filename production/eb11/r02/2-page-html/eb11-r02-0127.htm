<p><span class="font0">perforates the right liver, receiving from it many hepatic revehent veins and also the big revehent vessel from the left lobe; next it receives the coronary vein and then enters the heart&nbsp;as inferior vena cava. The portal vein arises out of the&nbsp;coccygo-mesenteric (which comes out of the bifurcation of the&nbsp;caudal), collecting the blood from most abdominal viscera and&nbsp;from the thorax and breaks up in the right liver. The rest of&nbsp;the venous system is rather complicated. The big caudal vessel&nbsp;divides near the vent, receives an unpaired cloacal and a rectal&nbsp;vessel, and goes off to the right and left, each of which trunks&nbsp;receives an ischiadic and an inter-sacral vein and then divides&nbsp;into the v. renalis advehens which breaks up in the kidney, and&nbsp;the abdominal vein. The latter are interesting; they run in the&nbsp;abdominal wall, receive the obturator and other pelvic veins,&nbsp;Intervertebrals and intercostals, the crurals, and the epigastrics&nbsp;out of the body-wall. Then these two abdominals (Rathke’s&nbsp;internal epigastrics) go to the liver, which they enter to either&nbsp;side of the gall bladder, collecting also blood from the stomach&nbsp;and from the vertebral column. Both break up in the liver.&nbsp;Consequently all the blood from “ below the heart ” passes&nbsp;through some portal system—renal or hepatic—except that&nbsp;which comes from the genital glands and ducts and from the fat&nbsp;body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tortoises.—</span><span class="font0">The venous system much resembles that of the crocodiles, but many and wide anastomoses, especially on the&nbsp;inside of the carapace and plastron, exist between often distant&nbsp;vessels, so that one lucky injection may fill the whole system.&nbsp;There are three advehent renal veins which collect on the back&nbsp;of their kidney into one stem; they dissolve completely into a&nbsp;portal system, and leave the kidney on its ventral surface as one&nbsp;v. renalis revehens. The right and left then' form the v. c.&nbsp;posterior which perforates the posterior margin of the right liver,&nbsp;then headwards of the liver takes up the hepatic and enters the&nbsp;heart. The three pairs of afferent renal veins are composed as&nbsp;follows. The externa collects from the shell and the abdominal&nbsp;muscles; the posterior collects along the rectum from the genital&nbsp;glands, the bladder, and from parts of other pelvic viscera; the&nbsp;anterior comes from the anterior part of the shell and runs backwards to the kidney, with frequent anastomoses with the other&nbsp;advehent renal veins. The abdominals arise, as in the crocodiles,&nbsp;with the external advehent renal from the lateral continuation&nbsp;of the bifurcated caudal, which takes up vessels from the pelvis,&nbsp;the shell and the crural. The abdominal itself takes up a&nbsp;femoral vein, vessels from the abdominal and pelvic muscles,&nbsp;and from the plastron, and then dives into the body-cavity,&nbsp;receives veins from the fore limbs, and enters the right lobe of&nbsp;the liver, there to break up.’ The hepatic portal collects fromthe&nbsp;intestinal tract, spleen and pancreas. Consequently in tortoises all the blood from beIow the heart passes through some&nbsp;portal system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The most important peculiarity of the Lizards is the condition of the abdominal veins ; they combine into a single stem (after having&nbsp;collected the blood from the fat body and from the ventral&nbsp;body-wall of the pelvic region) which dives into the body-cavity&nbsp;to join, embedded in the ventral hepatic ligament, the left&nbsp;branch of the portal vein. The chief characteristic of the&nbsp;abdominal is that it does not communicate directly with the&nbsp;caudal, and that it forms an unpaired stem. The renal portal&nbsp;system receives its blood from the tail, the hind limbs, the&nbsp;abdominal wall and the urino-genital organs, all the blood&nbsp;passing into a right and a left advehent vein. The suprarenal&nbsp;portal system drains from the abdominal wall and the suprarenal bodies, and issues into the revehent renals. These, with&nbsp;some intervertebrals and with hepatics, constitute the inferior&nbsp;vena cava.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lymphatic System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lymphatic vessels frequently accompany the big arteries of the trunk, either surrounding them with a meshwork or&nbsp;ensheathing them completely, .especially ‘ in tortoises. The&nbsp;lymphatics from the head and neck combine with stems which&nbsp;accompany the veins of the fore limbs; they join the thoracic&nbsp;ducts and these open into the brachio-cephalic veins, as they do in&nbsp;birds. The lymph from the tail flows into the ischiadic veins&nbsp;or into the advehent renal veins. Reptiles possess only a posterior&nbsp;pair of lymph-hearts; they are placed near the root of the tail&nbsp;against the ends of one of the transverse processes. In snakes&nbsp;they lie in a space protected by the ribs and transverse processes&nbsp;of the original sacral vertebrae. Lymph glands proper are&nbsp;not developed in reptiles, except in the shape of the so-called&nbsp;mesentericj;land of crocodiles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The red corpuscles are invariably oval, and, since they still possess a nucleus, biconvex. Numerous measurements have&nbsp;been made by G. Gulliver </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(P.Z.S.,</span><span class="font0"> 1845, pp. 93-102), their long&nbsp;and short axes range between 0-015-0-023 and 0-009-0-21 ram.&nbsp;respectively. That means to say they are very much larger&nbsp;than those of mammals, considerably larger than those of most&nbsp;birds, and in turn much smaller than those of amphibia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Digestive System.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Teeth.</span><span class="font0">—All the groups of recent reptiles have teeth, except the tortoises, which have lost even embryonic traces of them. In&nbsp;the under jaw they are restricted to the dentary bones. In the&nbsp;upper they are almost universal in the maxilla and premaxilla,&nbsp;although the latter has lost them in most of the snakes. The&nbsp;pterygoids are toothed in most snakes and in a few lizards, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;Lacerta</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iguana.</span><span class="font0"> The palatines are toothed-in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and in some lizards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Only the young of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> and the chameleons have a few small teeth on the vomer. The teeth themselves consist of&nbsp;dentine with a cap of enamel and with cementum around their&nbsp;base. In the crocodiles they are planted into separate alveoles&nbsp;in the maxilla, premaxilla and under jaw. In lizards they are&nbsp;either pleurodont, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> they stand in a series upon a longitudinal&nbsp;ridge which projects from the Bngual side of the supporting bone,&nbsp;or they stand upon the upper rim of the bone, acrodont. In&nbsp;either case they are, when full grown, cemented on to the bone.&nbsp;Acrodont are amongst lizards only the Agamidae; the Tejidae&nbsp;are intermediate, almost acrodont. All the snakes and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphe-nodon</span><span class="font0"> are acrodont. The latter is in so far peculiar as its broad-based, somewhat triangular teeth are much worn down in old&nbsp;specimens; originally there are several in the premaxilla, but the&nbsp;adults bite with the somewhat curved-down portions of the&nbsp;premaxillaries themselves, or with what remains of the anchy-Iosed bases of the original teeth, which then, together with the&nbsp;bone, look like a pair of large chisel-shaped incisors. The&nbsp;lateral edges of the palatines of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sphenodon</span><span class="font0"> likewise carry teeth,&nbsp;those of the mandibles fit into a long slit-like space between&nbsp;the palatine and the maxillary teeth. This is a unique arrangement. Further, it is surprising that in this old, Rhyncho-cephalian type the supply of teeth has become exhausted, whilst&nbsp;in the other recent reptiles the supply is continuous and apparently inexhaustible. The new teeth He on the lingual side of the&nbsp;old set, and long before the new tooth is finished part of the&nbsp;base of its older neighbour is absorbed, so that the pulp-cavity&nbsp;which persists in nearly all reptilian teeth becomes free. Ultimately the old tooth is pushed off and the new is cemented into&nbsp;its place. In the crocodiles it has come to pass that several&nbsp;sets of teeth are lodged more or less into one another’s bases.&nbsp;Where crocodiles and alligators collect habitually the ground&nbsp;is sometimes found strewn with thousands of teeth, large and&nbsp;small, every creature shedding about seventy teeth many times&nbsp;during its long life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some or all teeth of various families of lizards and snakes have a more or less pronounced groove or furrow along their&nbsp;anterior convex curve. The usefulness of this furrow in facilitating the entering of saliva into the bitten wound is merely&nbsp;incidental, but this preformed feature has in many snakes&nbsp;been improved into a fearful weapon. In the Opisthoglypha&nbsp;a few of the most posterior teeth in the maxilla are enlarged,&nbsp;have deeper furrows, and lie in the vicinity of the poison ducts.&nbsp;In the Proteroglypha one or two of the most anterior maxillary</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
