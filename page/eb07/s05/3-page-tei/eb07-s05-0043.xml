As the whole of this art depends upon a regular method and a simple alphabet, we have not only endeavoured to establish the former on satisfactory principles, but have been careful to appropriate, according to the comparative frequency of their occurrence, such characters for the letters as, after repeated trials and alterations, were conceived to be the best adapted for despatch.</p><p>The stenographic alphabet consists of eighteen distinct characters (viz. two for the vowels and the rest for the consonants), taken from lines and semicircular curves ; the formation and application of which we shall now explain, beginning with the vowels.</p><p>For the three first vowels, <hi rend="italic">a, e,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">i,</hi> a comma is appropriated in different positions ; and for the other three, o, <hi rend="italic">u</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> a point. The comma and point, when applied to <hi rend="italic">a</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">o</hi>, are to be placed at the top of the next character; when for <hi rend="italic">e</hi> and <hi rend="italic">u,</hi> opposite to the middle ; and when for <hi rend="italic">i </hi>and <hi rend="italic">y,</hi> at the bottom.</p><p>This arrangement of the vowels is the most simple and distinct that can easily be imagined. Places at the top, the middle, and the bottom of characters, which make three different positions, are as easily distinguished from one another as any three separate characters could be ; and a comma is made with the same facility as a point.</p><p>Simple lines may be drawn four different ways ; perpendicular, horizontal, and with an angle of about forty-five degrees to the right and left. An ascending oblique line to the right, which will be perfectly distinct from the rest when joined to any other character, may likewise be admitted. These characters being the simplest in nature, arc assigned to those five consonants which most frequently occur, viz. <hi rend="italic">l, r, t, c</hi> hard or <hi rend="italic">k,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">c</hi> soft or <hi rend="italic">s.</hi></p><p>Every circle may be divided with a perpendicular and horizontal line, so as to form likewise four distinct characters. These being the next to lines in the simplicity of their formation, we have appropriated them for <hi rend="italic">b, d, n,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">nι.</hi></p><p>The characters expressing nine of the consonants are all perfectly distinct from one another; eight only remain which are needful, viz. <hi rend="italic">f g</hi> or <hi rend="italic">j, h, p, q, υ, w,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">x ;</hi> to find characters for which we must have recourse to mixed curves and lines. The characters which we have adopted are the simplest in nature after those already applied, admit of the easiest joining, and tend to preserve lineality and beauty in the writing.</p><p>It must be observed, that we have no character for <hi rend="italic">c</hi> when it has a hard sound, as in <hi rend="italic">castle ;</hi> or soft, as in <hi rend="italic">city ;</hi> for it naturally takes the sound of <hi rend="italic">k</hi> or <hi rend="italic">s,</hi> which in all cases will be sufficient to supply its place.</p><p><hi rend="italic">R</hi> likewise is represented by the same character as <hi rend="italic">l ; </hi>only with this difference, <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is written with an ascending stroke,@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">l</hi> with a descending; which is always to be known from the manner of its union with the following character ; but in a few monosyllables where <hi rend="italic">r</hi> is the only consonant in the word, and consequently stands alone, it is to be made as is shown in the alphabet, for distinction’s sake.</p><p>Z, as it is a letter seldom employed in the English language, and only a coarser and harder expression of s<hi rend="italic">,</hi> must be supplied by <hi rend="italic">s</hi> whenever it occurs ; as for <hi rend="italic">Zedekiah</hi> write <hi rend="italic">Sedekiah, Sec.</hi></p><p>IV.	The prepositions and terminations in this scheme are so simple, that the greatest benefit may be reaped from them, and very little trouble required to attain them ; as the incipient letter or the incipient consonant of all the prepositions and of several of the terminations is used to express the whole. But in order to give every assistance, we have subjoined the following directions.</p><p>1.	The preposition is always to be written without joining, yet so near as plainly to show what word it belongs to ; and the best way is to observe the same order as if the whole was to be connected.</p><p>2.	A preposition, though the same letters that constitute it may be met with in the middle or end of a w ord, is never to be used, because it would expose to obscurity.</p><p>3.	Observe that the preposition <hi rend="italic">omni</hi> is expressed by the vowel <hi rend="italic">o</hi> in its proper position ; and for <hi rend="italic">anti, anta, ante,</hi> by the vowel <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> which the radical part of the word will easily distinguish from being only simple vowels.</p><p>The first rule for the prepositions is to be observed for the terminations ; and also the second, <hi rend="italic">mutatis mutandis; </hi>except that whenever <hi rend="italic">sis, sus, sys, cious, tious,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ces</hi> occur, they are to be expressed as directed in the fourth rule for the consonants, whether in the beginning, middle, or end of words.</p><p>4.	The terminative character for <hi rend="italic">tion, sion, cion, dan, tian,</hi> is to be expressed by a small circle joined to the nearest letter, and turned to the right ; and the plurals <hi rend="italic">lions, cions, cians, tians,</hi> by a dot on the same side.</p><p>5.	The terminative character for <hi rend="italic">ing</hi> is to be expressed likewise by a small circle, but drawn to the left hand ; and its plural <hi rend="italic">ings</hi> by a dot.@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi></p><p>6.	The plural sign <hi rend="italic">s</hi> is to be added to the terminative characters when necessary.</p><p>7.	The separated terminations are never to be used but in polysyllables, or words of more syllables than one.</p><p>These rules duly observed will point out a method as concise and elegant as can be desired, for expressing the most frequent and longest prepositions and terminations in the English language. If it should be thought necessary to increase their number by the addition of others, it will be an easy matter for any one of the least discernment to do so, by proceeding on the principles before laid down.</p><p>V.	Though a more concise method of writing, or more numerous abbreviations, may not be indispensably necessary, if the foregoing directions be practised for a considerable time, yet contractions will be found extremely useful and convenient to those who have attained a proper knowledge of the subject, and w ill lead to a greater degree of expedition, at the same time that they diminish the labour of writing. It has been observed in the introduction, that abbreviations are only to be employed by proficients in this art ; because expedition is not the first, though the ultimate, object in view ; and that an easy legibility is of the utmost consequence to the learner ; which however cannot be preserved, if he adopts too soon those very rules which in time will afford him the greatest ease when applied with judgment.</p><p>The following short and practical rules will be found, we hope, fully adequate to every purpose for which they were intended, and are far superior in the facility of their application to any which we have seen.</p><p><hi style="color:red; font-size: 14pt; font-weight:bold;" rend="ERROR">�</hi><note place="margin" type="conversion" resp="#teitodocx"><hi rend="docxError">unable to handle picture here, no embed or link</hi></note>@@@■ The character for A, when lineality requires it, may be made from the bottom and inverted.
