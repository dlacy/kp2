<p><span class="font1">Theſe ſix ſorts are hardy plants, and will thrive in the open air here. The firſt and fourth ſorts are not&nbsp;quite ſo hardy as the others, ſo muſt have a better fi-tuation, ptherwiſe their branches will be injured by ſe-vere froſt in the winter. They arc eaſily propagated by&nbsp;ſeeds, which if ſown in autumn the plants will come up&nbsp;the following ſpring ; but if they are ſown in ſpring,&nbsp;they will not come up till the next ſpring ; they may&nbsp;be either ſown in pots, or the full ground. If they&nbsp;are ſown in pots in autumn, the pots ſhould be placed&nbsp;under a common frame in winter, where the ſeeds may&nbsp;be protected from hard froſt ; and in the ſpring, if the&nbsp;pots are plunged into a very moderate hot-bed, the&nbsp;plants will ſoon riſe, and have thereby more time to get&nbsp;ſtrength before winter. When the plants come up, they&nbsp;muſt be gradually hardened to bear the open air, into&nbsp;which they ſhould be removed as ſoon as the weather is&nbsp;favourable, placing them where they may have the&nbsp;morning ſun ; in the ſummer, they muſt be kept clean&nbsp;from weeds, and in dry weather watered. Toward autumn it will be proper to ſtint their growth by keeping&nbsp;them dry, that the extremity of their ſhoots may harden ; for if they are replete with moiſture, the early&nbsp;froſts in autumn will pinch them, which will cauſe their&nbsp;ſhoots to decay almoſt to the bottom if the plants are&nbsp;not ſcreened from them. If the pots are put under a&nbsp;common frame in autumn, it will ſecure the plants from&nbsp;injury : for while they are young and the ſhoots ſoft,&nbsp;they will be in danger of ſuffering, if the winter proves&nbsp;very ſevere ; but in mild weather they muſt always enjoy the open air, therefore ſhould never be covered but&nbsp;in froſt. The ſpring following, juſt before the plants&nbsp;begin to ſhoot, they ſhould be ſhaken out of the pots,&nbsp;and carefully ſeparated, ſo as not to tear the roots ; and&nbsp;tranſplanted into a nurſery, in rows three feet aſunder,&nbsp;and one foot diſtance in the rows. In this nurſery they&nbsp;may Hand two years to get·ſtrength, and then may be&nbsp;tranſplanted where they are to remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">7. Beſides theſe, Linnæus has included in this genus the toxicodendron or poiſon-tree, under the name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rhus vernix</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">poiſon-aſh.</span><span class="font1"> This grows naturally in Virginia, Penſylvania, New .England, Carolina, and Japan,&nbsp;riſing with a ſtrong woody ſtalk to the height of 20&nbsp;feet and upwards ; though in this country it is ſeldom&nbsp;ſeen above 12, by reaſon of the plants being extremely&nbsp;tender. The bark is brown, inclining to grey ; the&nbsp;branches are garniſhed with winged leaves compoſed of&nbsp;three or four pair of lobes terminated by an odd one.&nbsp;The lobes vary greatly in their ſhape, but for the moſt&nbsp;part they are oval and ſpear-ſhaped. The footſtalks&nbsp;become of a bright purple towards the latter part of&nbsp;ſummer, and in autumn all the leaves are of a beautiful&nbsp;purple before they fall off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All the ſpecies of ſumach abound with an acrid milky juice, which is reckoned poiſonous; but this property is&nbsp;moſt remarkable in the vernix. The moſt diſtinct account of it is to be found in Proſeſſor Kalm’s Travels&nbsp;in North America. “ An inciſion (ſays he) being&nbsp;made into the tree, a whitiſh yellow juice, which lias a&nbsp;nauſeous ſmell, comes out between the bark and the&nbsp;wood. This tree is not known for its good qualities,&nbsp;but greatly ſo for the effect of its poiſon ; which, tho’&nbsp;it is noxious to ſome people, yet does not in the leaſt&nbsp;affect others. And therefore one perſon can handle&nbsp;the tree as he pleaſes, cut it, peel off its bark, rub it or</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">the wood upon his hands, ſmell at it, ſpread the juice upon his ſkin, and make more experiments, with no in.&nbsp;convenience to himſelf : another perſon, on the contrary, dares not meddle with the tree while its wood is&nbsp;freſh ; nor can he venture to touch a hand which has&nbsp;handled it, nor even to expoſe himſelf to the ſtnoke of&nbsp;a fire which is made with this wood, without ſoon feel,&nbsp;ing its bad effects ; for the face, the hands, and frequently the whole body, ſwclls exceſſively, and is af*&nbsp;fected with a very acute pain. Sometimes bladders or&nbsp;bliſters ariſe in great plenty, and make the fiεk perſon&nbsp;look as if he was infected by a leprofy. In ſome people the external thin ſhin, or cuticle, peels off in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fενι&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">days, as is the caſe when a perſen has ſcalded or burnt&nbsp;any part of his body. Nay, the nature of ſome perſons&nbsp;will not even allow them to approach the place where&nbsp;the tree grows, or to expoſe themſelves to the wind&nbsp;when it carries the effluvia or exhalations of this tree&nbsp;with it, without letting them feel the inconvenience of&nbsp;the ſwelling which I have juſt now deſcribed. Their&nbsp;eyes are ſometimes ſhut up for one, or two, or more&nbsp;days together, by the ſwelling. 1 know two brothers,&nbsp;one of whom could without danger handle this tree in&nbsp;what manner he pleaſed, whereas the other could not&nbsp;come near it without ſwelling. A perſon ſometimes&nbsp;does not know that he has touched this poiſonous plant,&nbsp;or that he has been near it, before his face and hands&nbsp;ſhow it by their ſwelling. I have known old people&nbsp;who were more afraid of this tree than of a viper ; and&nbsp;I was acquainted w<sub>j</sub>ith a perſon who, merely by the&nbsp;noxious exhalations of it, was ſwelled to ſuch a degree,&nbsp;that he was as ſtiff as a log of wood, and could only be&nbsp;turned about in ſheets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ I have tried experiments of every kind with the poifon-tree on myſelf. I have ſpread its juice upon my&nbsp;hands, cut and broke its branches, peeled off its bark,&nbsp;and rubbed my hands with it, ſmelt at it, carried pieces'&nbsp;of it in my bare hands, and repeated all this frequently,&nbsp;without feeling the baneful effects ſo commonly annexed to it ; but I, however, once cxperienced, that the'&nbsp;poiſon of the ſumach was not entirely without effect&nbsp;upon me. </span><span class="font0">Oil </span><span class="font1">a hot day in ſummer, as I was in ſome&nbsp;degree of peiſpiration, I cut a branch of the tree, anſh&nbsp;carried it in my hand for about half an hour together,&nbsp;and ſmelt at it now and then. I felt nq effects from it&nbsp;in the evening. But next morning I awoke with a-violent itching of my eye-lids and the parts thereabouts;&nbsp;and this was ſo painful, that I could hardly keep my&nbsp;hands from it. It ceaſed after I had waſhed my eyes&nbsp;for a while with very cold water. But my eye-lids&nbsp;were very ſtiff all that day. At night the itching returned ; and in the morning when I awoke, I felt it as&nbsp;ill as the morning before, and I uſed the ſame remedy&nbsp;againſt it. However, it continued almoſt for a whole&nbsp;week together ; and my eyes were very red, and my&nbsp;eye-lids were with difficulty moved during all that time.&nbsp;My pain ceaſed entirely afterwards. About the fame&nbsp;time I had ſpread the juice of the tree very thick upon&nbsp;my hand. Three days after, they occaſtoned bliſters,&nbsp;which ſoon went off without affecting me much. </span><span class="font2">I&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">have not experienced any thing more of the effects of&nbsp;this plant, nor had I any deſire ſo to do. However, I&nbsp;found that it could not exert its power upon me when-I was not perſpiring.</span></p>
