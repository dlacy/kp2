<p><span class="font0">lnto </span><span class="font1">Spain, where he erected a republic independent oſ Ro e. Pompey and Metellus, two of the beſt reputed&nbsp;generals in Ro ∙ e, were ſent againſt hi r ; but inſtead&nbsp;of conquering, they were on all occaſions conquered&nbsp;by him, and obliged to abandon their enterpriſe with&nbsp;diſgrace. At lait Sertorius was treacherouſly murdered ; and the traitors, who after his death uſurped the&nbsp;command, being totally deſſtute of his abilites, were&nbsp;eaſily defeated by Pompey : and thus that general reaped an undeſerved honour from concluding the war with&nbsp;ſucceſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Spaniſh war was ſcarce ended, when a very dangerous one was excited by Spartacus, a Thracian&nbsp;gladiator. For ſome time this rebel proved very luc-ceſsful ; but at laſt was totally defeated and killed by&nbsp;Craſſus. The fugitives, however, rallied again, to&nbsp;the number of </span><span class="font0">5000 ; </span><span class="font1">but, being totally defeated by&nbsp;Pompey, the latter took occaſion from thence to claim&nbsp;the glory which was juſtly due to Craſſus. Being thus&nbsp;become extremely popular, and ſetting no bounds to&nbsp;his ambiti<sup>z</sup>on, he was choſen conſul along with Craſſus.&nbsp;.Both generals were at the head of powerful armies ;&nbsp;and * conteſt between them immediately began about&nbsp;who ſhould firſt lay down their arms. With difficulty&nbsp;they were in appearance reconciled, and immediately&nbsp;began to oppoſe one another in a new way. Pompey&nbsp;courted the favour of the people, by reinſtating the&nbsp;tribunes in their ancient power, which had been greatly&nbsp;abridged by Sylla. Craſſus. though naturally covetous,&nbsp;entertained the populace with ſurpriſing profuſion at&nbsp;ιc,oco tables, and at the ſame time diſtributed corn&nbsp;ſufficient to maintain their families for three months.—&nbsp;Theſe prodigious expences will ſeem le</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">s ſurpriſing,&nbsp;when we conſider that Craſſus was the richeſt man in&nbsp;Rome, and that his eſtate amounted to upwards of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">70Ö0 </span><span class="font1">talents, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i. e.</span><span class="font1"> 1</span><span class="font0">,356,250 </span><span class="font1">1. ſterling. Notwithſtanding his utmoſt efforts, however, Pompey ſtill had the&nbsp;ſuperiority ; and was therefore propoſed as a proper&nbsp;perſon to be employed for clearing the ſeas of pirates. -In this new ſtation a moſt extenſive power was to be&nbsp;granted to him. He was to have an abſolute authority&nbsp;for three years over all the ſeas within the ſtraits or pillars of Hercules, and over all the countries for the&nbsp;ſpace of </span><span class="font0">400 </span><span class="font1">furlongs from the ſea. He was empowered to raiſe as many ſoldiers and mariners as he thought&nbsp;proper ; to take what ſums o'f money he pleaſed out of&nbsp;the public treaſury without being accountable for&nbsp;them ; and to chooſe out of the ſenate fifteen ſenators&nbsp;to be his lieutenants, and to execute his orders when he&nbsp;himſelf could not be preſent. I he ſenſible part of the&nbsp;people were againſt inveſting one man with ſo much&nbsp;power ; but the unthinking multitude rendered all oppoſition fruitleſs. The tribune Roſeius attempted to&nbsp;ſpeak againſt it, but was prevented by the clamours of&nbsp;the people. He then held up two of lus fingers, to&nbsp;ſhow that he was for dividing that extenſive commiſſion&nbsp;between two perſons : byt on this the aſſembly burſt&nbsp;out into ſuch hideous outcries, that a crow flying accidentally over the comitium, was ſtunned with the noiſe,&nbsp;and ſell down among the rabble. This law being agreed&nbsp;to, Pompey executed his commiſſion ſo much to the&nbsp;public ſatisfaction, that on his return a new law was&nbsp;.propoſed in bis favour. By this he was to be appointed general of all the forces in Aſia ; and as he was ſtill&nbsp;<sub>t</sub>o.retain the ſovereignty of the ſeas, he was now in</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">fact made ſovereign of all the Roman empire.— This law was ſupported by Cicero and Cæ</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ar, the&nbsp;former aſpiring at the conſulate, and the latter pleaſed to ſee the Romans ſo readily appointing themſelves a maſter. Pompey, however, executed his commiſſion with the utmoſt fidelity and ſucceſs, completing the conqueſt of Pontus, Albania, Iberia, &amp;c.&nbsp;which had been ſucceſsfully begun by Sylla and Lu-∙cullus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But while Pompey was thus aggrandiſing himſelf, the republic was on the point of being ſubverted by&nbsp;a conſpiracy formed by Lucius Sergius Catiline. He&nbsp;was deſeended from an illuſtrious family ; but having&nbsp;•quite ruined his eſtate, and rendered himſelf infamous&nbsp;by a ſeries of the moſt deteſtable crimes, he a</span><span class="font0">ſſ</span><span class="font1">ociated&nbsp;with a number of others in circumſtances ſimilar to&nbsp;his own, in order to repair their broken fortunes by&nbsp;ruining their country. Their ſeheme was to murder&nbsp;the conſuls together with the greateſt part of the ſenators, ſet fire to the city in different places, and then&nbsp;ſeize the government. This wicked deſign miſcarried&nbsp;twice'; but was not on that account dropped by the&nbsp;conſpirators. Their party increaſed every day ; and&nbsp;both Cæ</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ar and Craſſus, who ſince the departure of&nbsp;Pompey had ſtudied to gain the affections of the people as far as poſſible, were thought to have been privy&nbsp;to the conſpiracy. At laſt, however, the matter was&nbsp;diſcovered by means of a young knight, who had indiſe&nbsp;creetly revealed the ſecret to his paramour. Catiline&nbsp;then openly took the field, and ſoon raiſed a conſiderable army : but was utterly defeated and killed about&nbsp;62 B. C. ; and thus the republic was freed from the&nbsp;preſent danger.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time, Cæ</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ar continued to advance in popularity and in power. Soon after the defeat' of&nbsp;Catiline, he was created pontifex maximus ; and after&nbsp;that was ſent into Spain, where he ſubdued ſeveral nations that had never before been ſubject to Rome.—&nbsp;While he was thus employed, his rival Pompey returned from the eaſt, and was received with the higheſt&nbsp;honours ; but though ſtill as ambitious as ever, he now&nbsp;affected extraordinary modeſty, and declined accepting&nbsp;of the applauſe which was offered him. His aim was&nbsp;to aiſu e a ſovereign authority without ſeeming to deſire it ; but he was ſoon convinced, that, if he deſired&nbsp;to reign over his fellow-citizens, it muſt be by force of&nbsp;'arms. He therefore renewed his intrigues, and ſpared&nbsp;no pains, however mean and ſcandalous, to increaſe his&nbsp;popularity. Cæ</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">ar, on his return from Spain, found&nbsp;the ſovereignty divided between Craſſus and Pompey,&nbsp;each of whom was ineffectually ſtruggling to get the&nbsp;better of the other. Cælar, no le</span><span class="font0">ſ</span><span class="font1">s ambitious than the&nbsp;other two, propoſed that they ſhould put an end to their&nbsp;differences, and take him for a partner in their power.&nbsp;In ihort, he projected a triumvirate, or aſſociation of&nbsp;three perſons, (Pompey, Craſſus, and himſelf), in which&nbsp;ſhould be lodged the whole power of the ſenate and&nbsp;people ; and, in order to .make their confederacy more&nbsp;laſting, they bound themſelves by mutual oaths and promiſes to ſtand by each other, and ſuffer nothing to be&nbsp;undertaken or carried into execution without the unanimous conſent of all the three.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thus was the liberty of the Ro trans taken away a ſecond time, nor did they ever afterwards recover it .;&nbsp;though at preſent none perceived that this was the caſe,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
