<p><span class="font0">of them. Though they are not amphibious, they are said to keep under water above an hour. When they swim, they&nbsp;use not their feet, but clap them close to their body, and&nbsp;guide themselves with their tails ; they swallow all they eat&nbsp;whole. They cannot run fast, their holes being a greater&nbsp;security to them than their heels. They are so impatient&nbsp;of cold that they rarely appear out of their holes but when&nbsp;the sun shines.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The guana,” observes Browne, in his Natural History of Jamaica, “ like most of the tribe, lives a very considerable&nbsp;time without food, and changes its colour with the weather,&nbsp;or the native moisture of its place of residence. I have&nbsp;kept a grown guana about the house for more than two&nbsp;months ; it was very fierce and ill natured at the beginning,&nbsp;but after some days it grew more tame, and would at length&nbsp;pass the greatest part of the day upon the bed or couch,&nbsp;but it went out always at night. I have never observed it&nbsp;to eat anything, except what imperceptible particles it had&nbsp;lapped up in the air ; for it frequently threw out its forked&nbsp;tongue, like the cameleon, as it walked along. The flesh&nbsp;of this creature is liked by many people, and frequently&nbsp;served up in fricassees at their tables, in which state they&nbsp;are often preferred to the best fowls. The guana may be&nbsp;easily tamed while young, and is both an innocent and a&nbsp;beautiful creature in that state.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The horned iguana of St Domingo </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Jg. cornuta,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv.) is distinguished from the common kind by an osseous conical point between the eyes, and two raised scales upon the&nbsp;nostrils. The neck is not tuberculated. This species measures about four feet in length, and is frequently found on&nbsp;the hills of St Domingo, between Artibonite and Gonaives.&nbsp;It lives on fruits, insects, and small birds, which it seizes&nbsp;with surprising agility, and during the day it couches on&nbsp;trees and rocks to watch for its prey. During the night,&nbsp;and throughout the greatest heats of the hot season, it&nbsp;retires among the chambered rocks, or into the hollows&nbsp;of old trees, and there passes many months in a state&nbsp;of lethargy. This iguana is considered by the negroes as a&nbsp;great delicacy, and they accordingly search for it with avidity. According to the report of the colonists, its flesh resembles in flavour that of the roe-buck, and the maroon&nbsp;dogs make great slaughter among these reptiles. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The naked necked iguana </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(fg. nwlicollis,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv.) resembles the preceding species in its dorsal crest, but it does not possess either the large plates beneath the tympanum,&nbsp;nor the scattered tubercles on the sides of the neck. The&nbsp;upper part of the cranium is furnished with gibbous plates,&nbsp;the occiput is tubercular, and the dewlap or gular pouch&nbsp;is slightly dentated, and only on its anterior portion. Its&nbsp;native regions are Brazil and Guadaloupe, not India, as&nbsp;Laurenti supposes. (See Plate CCCCXXXI. fig. 8.) Several other species are described by naturalists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the genus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ophryessa,</span><span class="font0"> Boie, the scales are small and imbricated ; a dorsal crest, not greatly projecting, is prolonged upon the tail, which is compressed. The teeth resemble&nbsp;those of the preceding genus, but there is neither dewlap&nbsp;nor pores. The supercilious lizard of the older authors&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">( Oph. superciliosa)</span><span class="font0"> may be named as an example. It is an&nbsp;American species, of a fawn-colour, with a festooned band&nbsp;of brown along the flanks, and measures from twelve to&nbsp;sixteen inches. It derives its specific name from a peculiar membranous ridge which occupies the region of the&nbsp;eyebrow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genus Basiliscus, Daudin, has the scales of small size, and the raised ridge on the back and tail is continuous, and supported by the spiny processes of the vertebræ,&nbsp;after the fashion of the tail in the Amboyna lizard, as already mentioned in our brief notice of the gcnus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Istiurus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The name of Basilisc as naturally recalls to mind the fabled stories of antiquity as that of Dragon. It was supposed to be the most poisonous and malignant of creatures,&nbsp;its very aspect being regarded as fatal to the unhappy beholder. It exercised its tyrannous sway amid the burning&nbsp;and desert sands of Africa, and obliged each meaner reptile to keep at a respectful distance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Sibilaquc effundens cunctas terrentia pestes,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ante venena nocens, late sibi submovet omne Vulgus, et in vacua regnat Basiliscus arena.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the animals now known to naturalists under the name of Basilisc, we are happy to say, are harmless creatures, of very innocent manners, although of most extraordinary aspect. They do not occur in Africa, as Lucan&nbsp;feigns, nor in India, as Seba alleges, but in South America,&nbsp;especially Guiana, as Daudin has determined. The best&nbsp;known is the mitred species </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(B. mitratus, L. Basiliscus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Linn.), distinguished by a membranous crest upon the occiput, somewhat in the form of a cowl or hood, and supported by cartilage. It is of a bluish colour, with two&nbsp;white bands, one behind the eye and another behind the&nbsp;maxillæ. It measures from two to three feet in length, and&nbsp;feeds on grains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the genus Polychrus, Cuv. there is no dorsal crest, the head is covered with plates, and the tail is long and&nbsp;slender. The extensile skin of the throat is capable of being formed into a gular pouch at the will of the animal,&nbsp;and this genus possesses the power of changing colour like&nbsp;the cameleons. Thcir lungs are likewise very voluminous,&nbsp;filling up a great portion of the body, and subdividing&nbsp;into various branches. Their false ribs, too, like those&nbsp;of the caméléon, encompass the abdomen, and so unite as&nbsp;to form entire circles. The marbled lizard (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lac. marmorata,</span><span class="font0"> Linn.) may be named as an example. It is of a red-dish-gray colour, marbled with transverse irregular bands&nbsp;of brownish red, sometimes mingled with blue. The tail&nbsp;is of great length. This species is frequent in Guiana.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The genus Anolius, Cuv. combines with the form of the preceding a very peculiar and distinctive character,&nbsp;the skin of the toes being enlarged beneath the ante-penultimate joint, into an oval disk, transversely striated on the&nbsp;under surface, which aids the animal in climbing, which it&nbsp;is otherwise enabled well to do by means of its crooked&nbsp;claws. The body and tail are moreover chagrined with&nbsp;minute scales,' and the majority bear a dewlap or goitre-like&nbsp;expansion beneath the throat, which they not only inflate,&nbsp;but cause to change both in form and colour, in accordance&nbsp;with their various moods of love or anger. Indeed several of the species at least equal the cameleon in their power&nbsp;of assuming frequent and rapid alternations in the colour&nbsp;of their skin. Like these creatures, too, and the genus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Polychms,</span><span class="font0"> the ribs form entire circles. The species are&nbsp;peculiar to America, and several of them are even naturally&nbsp;of familiar habits, frequenting the vicinity of human habitations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In some there is a crest upon the tail, supported by the spiny processes of the vertebræ, as in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Istiurus</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Basiliscus.</span><span class="font0"> Such is the great crested Anolis (Λn. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">velifer,</span><span class="font0"> Cuv.),&nbsp;which measures about a foot in length. The crest extends&nbsp;over one half of the tail, and is supported by from twelve to&nbsp;fifteen rays ; the dewlap reaches to beneath the belly.&nbsp;(See Plate CCCCXXXΠ. fig. 2.) It is found in the Antilles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In others the tail is round, or only slightly compressed. The species of this section of the genus are numerous,&nbsp;and have been frequently confounded under one or two&nbsp;specific names. They inhabit the warmer parts of con-</span></p>
