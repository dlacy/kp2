He was remarkable for being a time server. During the life of Cromwell he was a staunch Presbyterian, and then railed against the Independents ; at the Restoration he exerted his pulpiteloquence against the Presbyterians ; and in the reign of Queen Anne was a warm advocate for Sacheverel.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">South Cape,</hi> at the southern extremity of New Holland.

It is 600 miles in length from Cape Comorin to the Krishna, and 500 miles in breadth where broadest. The great feature of this extensive region is the central tableland, from 3000 to 5000 feet above the level of the sea, separated by a wild, abrupt, and mountainous country, from the low plains to the east and west, which form a belt of small but unequal breadth between the hills and the sea. In this division of India may be seen the Hindu manners in their primitive simplicity, especially in Tinnevelly and the adjacent districts. The Mahommedans are few in comparison with the native Hindus, over whom twenty centuries have passed without making any change in their habits. Southern India has suffered grievously from the devastations of war, and fully as much from the cruel extortion of its rulers. The terri tories comprehended in this division of the country are, a small portion of the Bejapoor province, the Balaghaut ceded districts; the Carnatic, Northern, Central, and Southern; Mysore, Canara, Malabar, Barramahal, Coimbetoor, Din digul, Salem and Kistnagherry, Cochin and Travancore; a detailed description of which will be found under their re spective appellations.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">South Sea,</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Pacific Ocean,</hi> is that vast body of water interposed between Asia and America. It does not, how ever, strictly speaking, reach quite to the continent of Asia, excepting to the northward of the peninsula of Malacca ; for the water interposed between the eastern coast of Africa and the peninsula just mentioned has the name of the <hi rend="italic">Indian Ocean.</hi> The South Sea, then, is bounded on one side by the western coast of America, through its whole extent, from the unknown regions in the north to the Straits of Magellan and Terra del Fuego, where it communicates with the southern part of the Atlantic. On the other side, it is bounded by the coast of Asia, from the northern pro montory of Tschukotskoi Noss, to the peninsula of Ma lacca already mentioned. Thence it is bounded to the southward by the northern coasts of Borneo, Celebes, Ma cassar, New Guinea, New Holland, and the other islands in that quarter, which divide it from the Indian Ocean. Then, washing the eastern coast of the great island of New Holland, it communicates with that vast body of water en compassing the whole southern part of the globe, and which has the general name of the <hi rend="italic">Southern Ocean.</hi> Thus does this vast ocean occupy almost the semicircumference of the globe, reaching nearly from one pole to the other, and about the equatorial parts extending almost 180° in 1ongi tude, or 12,500 of our miles. The northern parts of the Pacific Ocean are entirely destitute of land, not a single island having yet been discovered in it from the latitude of 40° north and upwards, excepting such as are very near</p><p>the coast either of Asia or America; but in the southern part the islands are very numerous.

Lat. 43. 32. S.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SouTHwesT Isles,</hi> a group of islands, seven in number, dependent on the Banda Islands. Kissier is the chief, which lies to the southwest of them all. They are low, and surrounded by shoals and rocks, and are inhabited by a ferocious and perfidious race, resembling those of New Guinea, who seem to have sprung from the Papuas or aborigines of that country, and the Caffres of Africa. They produce sandalwood. The Dutch had a commercial es tablishment here. Population 36,266.</p><p>SOUTHAM, a small town of the hundred of Knightlow, in the county of Warwick, eightythree miles from London. It has little or no trade. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 935, in 1811 to 1007, in 1821 to 1161, and in 1831 to 1256.</p><p>SOUTHAMPTON, a town of Hampshire, seventy seven miles from London. It is finely situated at the junc tion of the river Test with the Itchen ; these form an ex panse of water, by which vessels may approach the town. It was anciently fortified, and the remains of its walls and castle still exist. It is one of the bestbuilt towns of Eng 1and. The High Street is broad and well paved. South ampton contains five parish churches, several almshouses, a grammar school, some convenient bathinghouses, public rooms, and an elegant theatre. The borough was incor porated by Charles I., and is governed by a mayor, re corder, bailiffs, sheriff, and commoncouncil men. It returns two members to parliament. It is in fact a county of itself, having its own magistrates, of whom the bishop of Winchester is one. This town has long been a place of great trade with Portugal, chiefly for the importation of portwine and fruit. It has also some trade with France, with the islands of Guernsey, Jersey, Alderney, and espe cially with the Isle of Wight, to which place packetboats are constantly sailing. The mildness of the air, the facility of making excursions by water as well as by land, the vicinity of the lsle of Wight and of New Forest, contribute to render the town a desirable place for either a temporary or a permanent residence, which is further recommended by the excellent supplies of fish, fruit, meat, and other ne cessaries. The railway which connects Southampton with the metropolis will greatly tend to promote its prosperity. The inhabitants amounted in 1801 to 7629, in 1811 to 9258, in 1821 to 13,913, and in 1831 to 19,324.</p><p>SOUTHEND, a hamlet in the parish of Prittlewell, in the hundred of Rochford and county of Essex, fortytwo miles from London. It stands at the mouth of the Thames, opposite to Sheerness ; and from its easy communication with the metropolis, it has of late years been resorted to by considerable numbers for seabathing.</p><p>SOUTHERNE, <hi rend="smallcaps">Thomas,</hi> an eminent dramatic writer, was born at Dublin in 1660, and received his education in Trinity College. He came young to London to study law ; but instead of that, devoted himself to poetry and the writing of plays. His Persian Prince, or Loyal Brother, was introduced in 1682, when the Tory interest was triumphant in England ; and the character of the Loyal Brother being intended to compliment James duke of York, he rewarded the author when he came to the throne with a commission in the army. On the Revolution taking place, he retired to his studies, and wrote several plays, from which he is supposed to have derived a very handsome subsistence, being the first who raised the advantage of playwriting to a second and third night. The most finished of all his plays are the Fatal Marriage, or the Innocent Adultery ; and Oroonoko, or the Royal Slave, which is built on a true story related in one of Mrs Behn’s novels.</p></body></text></TEI>
