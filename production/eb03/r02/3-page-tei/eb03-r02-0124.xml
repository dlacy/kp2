However, they did not yet enjoy tranquillity. The Sabines revolted, and continued the war for ſome time with great obſtinacy : but being defeated in ſeveral engagements, they were at laſt obliged to ſubmit ; and ſcarce was this war ended, when another began with the Latins, who now declared ſor king Tarquin. Before they jjegan this war, however, an embaſſy was ſent to Rome, the purport of which was, that the Romans ſhould raiſe the ſiege of Fidenæ which had revolted, and receive the Tarquins ; who, on their part, ſhould grant a general amneſty. The ambaſſadors were to allow the Romans a whole year to conſider on theſe overtures ; and to threaten them with a war in caſe they reſuſed to comply with them. The chief view of Tarquin and his partiſans in promoting this embaſſy was, to lay hold of that opportunity to raiſe a ſedition in the city. To the ambaſſadors, therefore, of the Latins, he joined ſome of his own emiſſaries, who, on their arrival in the city, found two ſorts of people diſpoſed to enter into their meaſures; to wit, the ∩aves, and the meaner citizens.</p><p>The ſlaves had formed a conſpiracy the year before to ſeize the Capitol, and ſet fire to the city in ſeveral quarters at the ſame time. But the plot being diſcovered, thoſe who were concerned in it had been all crucified, and this execution had highly provoked the whole body of ſlaves. As to the meaner citizens, who were for the moſt part overwhelmed with debt, and cruelly uſed by their creditors, they were well appri-ſed that there could happen no change in the government but to their advantage. Theſe were the conſpirators pitched upon, and to them were given the following parts to act : the citizens were to make themſelves maſters of the ramparts and gates of the city, at an appointed hour of the night ; and then to raiſe a great ſhout as a ſignal to the ſlaves, who had engaged to maſſacre their maſters at the ſame inſtant : the gates of the city were then to be opened to the Tarquins, who were to enter Rome while it was yet reeking with the blood of the ſenators. The conſpiracy was ripe for execution, when Tarquin’s principal agents, Publius and Marcus, both of his own name and family, being terrified with frightful dreams, had not courage enough to proceed in their deſign till they had conſulted a diviner. However, they did not diſcover to him the conſpiracy ; but only aſhed him in general terms, what ſucceſs they might expect in a project they had formed ? The ſoothſayer, without the leaſt heſitation, returned the following anſwer ; <hi rend="italic">Dour project will end in your ruin ; dſburden your (elves of ſo heavy a load.</hi>  Hereupon the Tarquins, fearing leſt ſome of the other conſpirators ſhould be beforehand with them in informing, went immediately to S. Sulpitius, the only conſul then at Rome, and diſcovered the whole matter to him. Tſte conſul greatly commended them, and detained them in his houſe, till, by private inquiries, he was aſſured of the truth of their depoſitions. Then he aſſembled the ſenate, and gave the Latin ambaſſadors their audience of leave, with an anſwer to their propofols; which was, that the Romans would neither receive the Tarquins, nor raiſe the ſiege of Fidenæ, being all</p><lb/><p>to a man ready to ſacriſice their lives in defence of their liberties, and willing to undergo any dangers rather than ſubmit to the government of a tyrant.</p><p>The ambaſſadors being diſmiſſed with this anſwer, and conducted out of the city, Sulpitius laid open to the fathers the dreadful conſpiracy. It ſtruck them with horror : but they were all at a loſs in what manner they ſhould apprehend and puniſh the guilty; ſince, by the law of Poplicola, there was an appeal to the people in all capital caſes ; and the two witneſſes, who were ſtrangers, might be excepted againſt by Roman citizens. In this perplexity they left the whole conduct of this critical affair to Sulpitius; who took a method which he thought would equally ſerve to prove the guilt and puniſh the guilty. He engaged the two informers to aſſemble the conſpirators, and to appoint a rendezvous at midnight in the forum, as if they deſigned to take the laſt meaſures for the execution of the enterpriſe. In the mean time he uſed all proper means to ſecure the city, and ordered the Roman knights to hold themſelves ready, in the houſes adjoining to the forum, to execute the orders they ſhould receive. The conſpirators met at the time and place appointed by the two Tarquins ; and the knights, upon a ſignal agreed on beforehand, inveſted the forum, and blocked up all the avenues to it ſo cloſely, that it was impoſſiblè for any of the conſpirators to make their eſcape. ’ As ſoon as it was light, the two conſuls appeared with a ſtrong guard on the tribunal ; for Sulpitius had ſent to his colleague Manius, who was beſieging Fidenæ, deſiring him to haften to the city with a choſen body of troops. The people were convened by curiæ, and acquainted with the conſpiracy which' had been formed againſt the common liberty. The accuſed were allowed to make their defence, if they had any thing to offer againſt the evidence; but not one of them denying the fact, the conſuls repaired to the ſenate, where ſentence of death was pronounced againſt the conſpirators, in caſe the people approved it.</p><p>This decree of the ſenate being read to and approved by the aſſembly, the people were ordered to retire, and the conſpirators were delivered up to the ſoldiers, who put them all to the ſword. The peace of Rome was thought ſufficiently ſecured by this ſtroke of ſeverity ; and therefore, though all the conſpirators were not puniſhed with death, it was judged proper not to make any further inquiries. The two informers were rewarded with all the privileges of Roman citizens, ιoo,boo aſes, and 20 acres of land. Three feſtival-days were appointed for expiations, ſacrifices, and public games, by way of thankſgiving to the gods. But rhe general joy was diſturbed by a melancholy accident : as the people were conducting Manius Tullius the conſul from the circus to his houſe, he fell from his chariot, and died three days after.</p><p>The city of Fidenæ was not yet reduced : it held out during the following conſulſhip of T. Æbutius and P. Veturius ; but was taken the next year by T. Lartius, who, together with Q. Clælius, was raiſed to the conſular dignity. The Latins, enraged at the loſs of this town, began to complain of their leading men ; which opportunity Tarquin and Mamilius improved fo far, as to make all the Latin cities, 24 in number, enter into an alliance againſt Rome, and t6' bind themſelves by oath never to violate their engagements.
