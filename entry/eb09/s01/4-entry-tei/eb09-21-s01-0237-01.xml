The upper town preserves some part of the fortifications which protected it when, previous to the plague of 1630, the city had upwards of 30,000 inhabitants; and the hill is crowned by the ruins of an ancient castle. The more important castle of the marquises (in which according to the legend the patient Griselda was confined) is in the lower town and now serves as a penitentiary. Besides the cathedral (Gothic, 1480-1511), with the tombs of the old marquises, other conspicuous buildings are the churches of San Giovanni (formerly San Domenico) and San Bernardo (the former the finest architectural monument of the marquisate), the old town-house (1462), the new town-house (formerly belonging to the Jesuits), and the theatre (1829). To the north of the city lies the abbey of Staffarda (1130-1737). The population of the city was 10,145 (commune 16,237) in 1880.</p><p>By some authorities Saluzzo is identified with Augusta Vagiennorum. The line of its marquises began (1142) with Manfred, son of Boniface, marquis of Savona, and continued till 1548, when the death of Gabriel, imprisoned by Henry II. of France in the castle of Pinerolo, allowed city and territory to be seized by the French. The marquises of Saluzzo being great opponents of the house of Savoy, and frequently taking part in the struggles between France and the empire, the city often had to suffer severely from the fortunes of war. Henry IV. restored the marquisate to Charles Emmanuel I. of Savoy at the peace of Lyons in 1601. Among the celebrities of Saluzzo are Silvio Pellico (whose statue, 1863, gives name to the Piazza del Statuto), Bodoni the famous printer, and Casalis the historian of Sardinia. The history of the marquisate was written by Delfino Muletti, 5 vols., 1829-1833.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
