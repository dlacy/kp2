<p><span class="font1">political system, was at first exclusively military in its nature and objects.<sup>@@1</sup> It amounted, in fact, to the formation of a new&nbsp;and enlarged army on a new footing. In this force, excepting&nbsp;in the case of the centuries of the horsemen, no regard was paid&nbsp;either to the old clan divisions or to the semi-religious, semipolitical curiae. In its ranks were included all freeholders&nbsp;within the Roman territory, whether members or not of any&nbsp;of the old divisions, and the organization of this new army of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">assidui</span><span class="font1"> was not less independent of the old system with its clannish&nbsp;and religious traditions and forms. The unit was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">centuria&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or company of ioo men; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">centuriae</span><span class="font1"> were grouped in <sup>a</sup> classes ”&nbsp;and drawn up in the order of the phalanx.<sup>@@2</sup> The centuries&nbsp;in front were composed of the wealthier citizens, whose means&nbsp;enabled them to bear the cost of the complete equipments&nbsp;necessary for those who were to bear the brunt of the onset.&nbsp;These centuries formed the first class. Behind them stood the&nbsp;centuries of the second and third classes, less completely armed,&nbsp;but making up together with those of the first class the heavyarmed infantry.<sup>@@3 </sup>In the rear were the centuries of the fourth&nbsp;and fifth classes, recruited from the poorer freeholders, and&nbsp;serving only as light-armed troops. The entire available body&nbsp;of freeholders was divided into two equal portions, a reserve&nbsp;corps of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">seniores</span><span class="font1"> and a corps of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">juniores</span><span class="font1"> for active service. Each of these corps consisted of 85 centuries or 8500&nbsp;men, x.e. of two legions of about 4200 men each, the normal&nbsp;strength of a consular legion under the early Republic.<sup>@@4</sup> It&nbsp;is noticeable also that the heavy-armed centuries of the&nbsp;three first classes in each of these legions represented a total&nbsp;of 3000 men, a number which agrees exactly with the number of&nbsp;heavy-armed troops in the legion as described by Polybius.&nbsp;Attached </span><span class="font2">to the </span><span class="font1">legions, but not included in them, were the&nbsp;companies </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font1">sappers and trumpeters. Lastly, to the six&nbsp;centuries of horsemen, which still retained the old tribal names,&nbsp;twelve more were added as a distinct body, and recruited from&nbsp;the wealthiest class of citizens.<sup>@@5</sup> The four “ tribes” also&nbsp;instituted by Servius were probably intended to serve as the&nbsp;bases for the levy of freeholders for the new army.<sup>@@6</sup> As their&nbsp;names show, they corresponded with the natural local divisions&nbsp;of the city territory.<sup>@@7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The last of these Etruscan lords to rule in Rome was Tarquin the Proud. He is described as a splendid and despotic monarch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His sway extended over Latium as far south as Circeii. Aristodemus, tyrant of Cumae, was his ally, and&nbsp;kinsmen of his own were princes at Collatia, at Gabii,&nbsp;and at Tusculum. The Volscian highlanders were chastised, and&nbsp;Signia with its massive walls was built to hold them in check.&nbsp;In Rome itself the Capitoline temple and the great cloaca&nbsp;bore witness to his power. But his rule pressed heavily&nbsp;upon the Romans, and at the last, on the news of the foul&nbsp;wrong done by his son Sextus to a noble Roman matron,&nbsp;Lucretia, the indignant people rose in revolt. Tarquin,&nbsp;who was away besieging Ardea, was deposed; sentence of&nbsp;exile was passed upon him and upon all his race; and the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">people swore that* never again should a king rule in Rome. Freed from the tyrant, they chose for themselves two yearly&nbsp;magistrates who should exercise the supreme authority, and&nbsp;thus the Republic of Rome was founded. Three times </span><span class="font2">the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">banished Tarquin strove desperately to recover the throne&nbsp;he had lost. First of all the men of Veii and Tarquinii marched&nbsp;to his aid, but were defeated in a pitched battle on the Roman&nbsp;frontier. A year later Lars Porsena, prince of Clusium, at the&nbsp;head of all the powers of Etruria, appeared before the gates of&nbsp;Rome, and closely besieged the city, until, moved by the valour&nbsp;of his foe, he granted honourable terms of peace and withdrew.<sup>@@8&nbsp;</sup>Once again, by Lake Regillus, the Romans fought victoriously&nbsp;for their liberty against Tarquin’s son-in-law Mamilius, prince&nbsp;of Tusculum, and chief of the Latin name. Mamilius was slain;&nbsp;Tarquin in despair found a refuge at Cumae, and there soon&nbsp;afterwards died.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">So, in brief, ran the story of the flight of the kings, as it was told by the chroniclers whose story Livy reports, though with&nbsp;explicit and repeated notes of reserve. Its details are most&nbsp;of them fabulous; it is crowded with inconsistencies and&nbsp;improbabilities; there are no trustworthy dates; the names&nbsp;even of the chief actors are probably fictitious, and the hand&nbsp;of the improver, Greek or Roman, is traceable throughout.<sup>@@9</sup>&nbsp;But there is no room for doubting the main facts of the emancipation of Rome from the rule of alien princes and the final abolition&nbsp;of the kingly office.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(H.
