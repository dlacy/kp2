<p><span class="font0">ROMFORD, a market-town of the county of Essex, in the parish of Hornchurch and hundred of Havering, eleven&nbsp;miles from London. The population was, in 1801, 3179;&nbsp;in 1811, 3244 ; in 1821, 3777 ; and in 1831, 4294.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROMILLY, Samuel, one of the most enlightened and virtuous public men whom England has ever possessed, was,&nbsp;as his family-name indicates, the descendant of a French&nbsp;family. He was the son of a jeweller in London, and was&nbsp;born there on the 1st of March 1757.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The education of this child, destined in time to occupy so distinguished a place, was conducted for some time with even&nbsp;less care than might have been expected from the station&nbsp;held by his family. But, heartily disliking his father’s business, he was at length allowed to change it for professional&nbsp;employments, though as yet in an inferior department. At&nbsp;the age of sixteen he was articled to one of the six clerks in&nbsp;chancery ; and in the easy mechanical duties of his master’s&nbsp;chambers, relieved by the zealous prosecution of his studies&nbsp;both in English and Latin, passed several years of his life.&nbsp;He then resolved on coming to the bar, a step which, he&nbsp;informs us, all his friends, with one exception, considered&nbsp;as highly imprudent. One circumstance which helped to&nbsp;determine Romilly was very interesting ; the purchase of a&nbsp;seat in the office in which he had been articled would have&nbsp;cost a sum which he knew it would be inconvenient for his&nbsp;father to advance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He had completed his twenty-first year when he entered himself at Gray’s Inn, becoming, at the same time, a pupil&nbsp;of an able equity-draftsman. General reading both in English and Latin, translation habitually practised from the latter language into the former, the composition of a few political essays for the newspapers, and occasional attendance&nbsp;on the houses of parliament, now alternated with a closeness of application to legal study, which, after a time, injured his health, and compelled him to retire, first to Bath,&nbsp;and afterwards to the continent. At Geneva he became&nbsp;acquainted with some of the men who were then beginning&nbsp;to attract notice in that city ; and, among acquaintances thus&nbsp;made, the most valuable was that of Dumont. After visiting&nbsp;some of the nearest scenery of the Leman Lake, and of&nbsp;Savoy, Romilly proceeded to Paris, where he met D’Alembert, Diderot, and other eminent men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the last day of Easter term 1783, he was called to the bar. For some years afterwards, he obtained an increasing employment in the drawing of chancery pleadings ; but&nbsp;during this time, as he says himself, he had hardly once occasion to open his lips in court. In the spring of 1784, he&nbsp;went upon the midland circuit, which he continued to frequent until, even as admitted in his own modest Memoir,&nbsp;he was decidedly its leader. His chancery business, however, to which at length he entirely devoted himself, had&nbsp;become very great before he confined himself entirely to&nbsp;town ; and his principal reason for remaining so long on&nbsp;the circuit, is assigned by himself in one of his calmly characteristic expressions of honourable ambition : he desired&nbsp;to qualify himself for being a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Long before he left the circuit, he had attained a distinguished position in the eyes of those who were qualified to appreciate him, not merely as a lawyer, but as a statesman. In 1784, he became acquainted with Mirabeau,&nbsp;who was then in London, and of whose character he appears to have formed an exceedingly just estimate. Mirabeau was the medium through which Romilly became&nbsp;known to Lord Lansdowne, and thus to the leaders of that&nbsp;political party of which he had throughout been an honest&nbsp;and warm adherent. To that nobleman he was recommended, both by the hearty praises of Mirabeau, and by a&nbsp;pamphlet he had written, called “ A Fragment on the Constitutional Power and Duties of Juries.” Lord Lansdowne,&nbsp;directing Romilly’s attention to a recent sanguinary tract&nbsp;on Criminal Punishments, induced him to write an an</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">swer, which was published anonymously, under the title of “ Observations on a late Publication, entitled ‘ Thoughts&nbsp;on Executive Justice.’ ” In the mean time he continued&nbsp;vigorously to prosecute in private the inquiries into the&nbsp;Reform of the Laws, especially the Criminal Laws, of which&nbsp;he had thus begun to announce publicly the parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the vacation of 1788, he paid a third visit to Paris. Introductions from England, and other circumstances, brought Romilly and his fellow-traveller Dumont into intercourse,&nbsp;upon this occasion, with many men distinguished then, and&nbsp;with others still more celebrated in the bloody struggle&nbsp;that was about to ensue. Mirabeau at this time translated into French, and published, observations made by&nbsp;Romilly on the Hospital and Prison of Bicêtre. This&nbsp;pamphlet had the honour to be suppressed by the police of&nbsp;Paris, but in the original English was afterwards printed&nbsp;by the author himself in an obscure London periodical.&nbsp;In July 1789, Romilly wrote a pamphlet which was afterwards published ; “ Thoughts on the Probable Influence of&nbsp;the French Revolution on Great Britain.” But the lively&nbsp;interest he took in the events which emerged in Paris,&nbsp;while he was engaged in composing these remarks, led&nbsp;him back to that city in August of the same year ; and he&nbsp;now saw, both in public and private, many of the persons&nbsp;who had become most distinguished in the National Assembly. Dumont’s observations upon the eventful summer&nbsp;of 1789 in France, were translated into English by Romilly, and, with the addition of some observations by himself&nbsp;on England, were published in 1792, receiving the title of&nbsp;“ Groenvelt’s Letters.” Many of Romilly’s opinions on the&nbsp;progress of the French Revolution are contained in his&nbsp;published correspondence with Dumont, Madame Gautier,&nbsp;Dugald Stewart, and others, and in a diary which he kept&nbsp;during a journey to Paris in the autumn of 1802.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While Romilly was thus advancing to the highest rank in his profession, and had gained the confidence and admiration of some of the best statesmen in England, his domestic position underwent a most beneficial change, the immediate cause of which was a visit paid to Lord Lansdowne.&nbsp;In his private Memoirs he thus speaks of a person whom&nbsp;he accidentally met on this occasion. “ I saw in her the most&nbsp;beautiful and accomplished creature that ever blessed the&nbsp;sight and understanding of man. A most intelligent mind, an&nbsp;uncommonly correct judgment, a lively imagination, a cheerful disposition, a noble and generous way of thinking, an elevation and heroism of character, and a warmth and tenderness&nbsp;of affection, such as is rarely found even in her sex, were&nbsp;among her extraordinary endowments. I was captivated&nbsp;alike by the beauties of her person and the charms of her&nbsp;mind. A mutual attachment was formed betwecn us, which&nbsp;at the end of little more than a year was consecrated by marriage. All the happiness I have known in her beloved society,&nbsp;all the many and exquisite enjoyments which my dear children have afforded me, even my extraordinary success in my&nbsp;profession, the labours of which, if my life had not been so&nbsp;cheered and exhilarated, I never could have undergone,—&nbsp;all are to be traced to this trivial cause.” The object of&nbsp;this beautiful eulogium was the eldest daughter of Mr Gar-bett of Knill Court in Herefordshire. His marriage with&nbsp;this lady took place in January 1798, when he had nearly&nbsp;completed his forty-first year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He continued to be chiefly occupied in the discharge of his duties as a leader of the Chancery bar for several years,&nbsp;after which he united with these the other avocations that&nbsp;have given to his name so distinguished a place in the list of&nbsp;British statesmen. In the autumn of 1805 he had received&nbsp;from the Prince of Wales the offer of a seat in parliament,&nbsp;which he declined upon grounds strongly marking his sturdy&nbsp;independence of character. These reasons were the same&nbsp;which, many years before, had made him interfere to prevent a similar offer from being addressed to him by Lord</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
