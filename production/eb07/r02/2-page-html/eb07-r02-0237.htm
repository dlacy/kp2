<p><span class="font0">rived their name. It contains a number of tombstones covered with inscriptions and hieroglyphical figures, which can hardly now be satisfactorily deciphered. Some of these are&nbsp;believed to be tombs of Danish kings, which induces certain&nbsp;individuals to believe that the name is a corruption from&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eilean-nan-Righ,</span><span class="font0"> or the King’s Island; whilst others take it&nbsp;from a good man called Saint Maree, who inhabited this&nbsp;island many generations ago, and of whose benevolent and&nbsp;charitable actions many traditions are still preserved in the&nbsp;surrounding districts. In the centre of the island there is&nbsp;a deep well, dedicated to Saint Mary or Maree. To this&nbsp;a strange superstition attaches. Unhappy maniacs are carried to it and made to drink of its waters; after which they&nbsp;are plunged into the lake, and towed round the island at&nbsp;the stern of a boat, in the absurd hope that they will be&nbsp;thus restored to their senses. Fortunately for humanity,&nbsp;this absurd practice is fast wearing out.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The scenery on the river Conan and some of its tributaries is beautiful and interesting. The fails of Rogie are by many considered as inferior only to those of Foyers and&nbsp;Moness. We may indeed affirm that most of the valleys or&nbsp;river-courses in the united counties are more or less worth&nbsp;visiting, for the wild, the romantic, or the retired pastoral&nbsp;scenes which they contain. The waterfall of Glomach, in&nbsp;the parish of Kintail, is one of the highest and finest in the&nbsp;kingdom. It is to be found in a remote uninhabited valley on the estate of Mr Mackenzie of Applecross, about&nbsp;seven miles from the inn of Sheal-house ; and it will well&nbsp;repay the lover of the grandeur of nature for any fatigue&nbsp;or trouble which he may have in visiting it. Its height,&nbsp;lately ascertained, without instruments, but as accurately&nbsp;as the nature of the ground admitted, is about 350 feet.&nbsp;At the height of about fifty feet the water meets with a&nbsp;slight interruption from a shelving projection in the rock.&nbsp;This, however, is a circumstance that adds greatly to the&nbsp;effect, by increasing the volume of spray, and producing&nbsp;variety in the form of the fall. But when the river Gir-sac is swollen, the sheet of water is unbroken, terrific, and&nbsp;sublime. The fall is best viewed from a solitary tree&nbsp;standing on a narrow neck of rock projecting towards the&nbsp;water, about 100 feet down the ravine, to the south-west&nbsp;of the fall. There the stream appears to issue from an&nbsp;oblong fissure in the rock, from whence, with a fearful&nbsp;rush, it urges its way, chiefly in one great column, to the&nbsp;pool below, from which, at this station, no outlet can be&nbsp;perceived. The environs of the fall are wild and barren,&nbsp;consisting of great naked sheets of perpendicular rocks partially covered with tufts of grass, ferns, or mountain saxifrage, adding, if possible, to the savage character of the&nbsp;scene.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The mountain groups of Ross and Cromarty are very lofty. They rise gradually from the east coast, and more&nbsp;suddenly and boldly from the western sea, to which the&nbsp;summit-level of the country is more generally approximated. The mountains are all of the primitive formation, the secondary strata being found reclining on it on&nbsp;both sides of the island. The granitic series present extremely abrupt sections towards Moray Frith, and there&nbsp;we also find the older and other sandstones, with argillaceous formations abounding in animal remains, with plates&nbsp;resembling those of the tortoise, pieces of rough skin like&nbsp;that of the shark, the scales and bones of fish ; and in a&nbsp;ridge of bituminous shale, near the Cromarty rocks, we&nbsp;find ammonites, bellemnites, scallops plain and striated,&nbsp;pieces of wood, and a thick fleshy-looking leaf resembling&nbsp;that of the aloe. The mineralogical catalogue is large.&nbsp;Limestone, and primitive limestone of the character of&nbsp;marble, are very commonly to be met with. Ironstone is&nbsp;disseminated in great abundance. A vein of iron was worked&nbsp;above 150 years ago on the shores of Loch Maree, the works&nbsp;having been discontinued solely from the failure of wood</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">necessary for fuel. There is a rich vein of iron ore in the parish of Alness, and in the same vicinity there is a vein of&nbsp;lead, and indications of that metal have been found in the&nbsp;parish of Kilteam. A copper-mine at Keeshorn, in the&nbsp;northern district of the parish of Applecross, was considered by Williams as equally rich with any mine of the same&nbsp;metal to be found in Great Britain. On the farm of Scor-raig, on the Dundonnell estate, there is a prodigious quantity of bog-iron ore, which gives a strong and harsh chalybeate taste to all the springs in the neighbourhood. There&nbsp;are various mineral springs in the united shires of Ross&nbsp;and Cromarty, but those which have attained the greatest&nbsp;celebrity are the two wells of Strathpeffer, which have now&nbsp;for many years attracted numerous visitors to their neighbourhood in search of health and recreation. Both of these&nbsp;springs have the smell of sulphuretted hydrogen gas, but&nbsp;the upper spring is stronger than the lower. According to&nbsp;Dr Thomson, the temperature of the lower well, on the&nbsp;24th of June 1824, was 39°, and that of the upper 39¼<sup>0</sup>, the&nbsp;day being rainy, and the temperature of the air rather under 60°. The specific gravity of the water of these wells&nbsp;was as follows :</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upper well............1∙00193.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Lower w<sup>r</sup>ell............1*00091.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An imperial gallon of the upper spring was found to contain,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sulphuretted hydrogen gas......26∙167 cubic inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sulphate of soda..................67*770 grains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sulphate of lime..................39*454 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Common salt.......................24*728 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sulphate of magnesia............ 6*242 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An imperial gallon of the water from the pump-room yielded</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sulphuretted hydrogen gas......13*659 cubic inches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The saline contents were similar to those of the upper spring, but in the proportion to them of seven to nine, via.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sulphate of soda........................52*710 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sulphate of lime........................30*686 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Sulphate of magnesia................. 4*855</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many of the mountains of Ross and Cromarty are of first-rate British magnitude. Scuirvullin is about 2500 feet high. It consists entirely of micaceous schist, inclining in&nbsp;some places to gneiss, and traversed by a few granite and&nbsp;quartz veins. The rocks lie in thin upright stratiform&nbsp;shapes, which dip in opposite directions all round the mountain ; and they contain numerous round nodules of quartz,&nbsp;feldspar, and red garnets. All the common alpine plants&nbsp;are to be met with on Scuirvullin. Ben Weavish, or Ben&nbsp;Uaish, that is, the mountain of storm, is one of the most&nbsp;remarkable mountains, not only in Ross and Cromarty, but&nbsp;in Scotland. Its height, by the late trigonometrical survey,&nbsp;is 3720 feet ; but it is most wonderful for its immense bulk,&nbsp;by which it stands prominently distinguished from the other&nbsp;hills around it, so as to be peculiarly striking from great distances. Its corries or ravines are never without snow, so&nbsp;that the proprietor can always fulfil his quit-rent by paying&nbsp;a snowball to his sovereign when required to do so, on any&nbsp;day of the year. The primitive rocks of which it is composed are chiefly a gray gneiss, abounding in large scales&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font0">mica and garnets, which impart great beauty to the unpolished rock, though they are not sufficiently pure or free&nbsp;from cracks to be used as ornamental stones. The plants&nbsp;which it presents most interesting to the botanist are, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saxifraga oppositifoUα, Arbutus alpina, Azalea procumbens, Betula nana,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. Bean Dearig on Loch Broom is 3551 feet in&nbsp;height. It is composed of gneiss, with granite veins and beds&nbsp;of quartz. We might mention many other mountains, but&nbsp;we shall content ourselves with stating, that Tullochard, on&nbsp;the north side of Loch Duich, merits particular notice»</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
