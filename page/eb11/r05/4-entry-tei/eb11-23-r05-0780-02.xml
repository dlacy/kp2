                <p><label>ROUTH, EDWARD JOHN</label> (1831-1907), English mathematician, was born at
                    Quebec on the 20th of January 1831. At the age of eleven he came to England, and
                    after studying under A. de Morgan at University College, London, entered
                    Peterhouse, Cambridge, in 1851. In the mathematical tripos three years later he
                    was senior wrangler, beating J. Clerk Maxwell, who, however, tied with him for
                    the Smith’s prize. Elected a fellow of his college, he devoted himself to
                    teaching, and quickly proved himself one of the most successful mathematical “
                    coaches ” ever known at Cambridge. In thirty years, of some 700 pupils who
                    passed through his hands 500 became wranglers; and for twenty-two successive
                    years, from 1861 to 1882, the senior wrangler was trained by him. He made
                    considerable contributions to scientific literature, and among his publications
                    were: <hi rend="italic">An Analytical View of Newton’s Principia,</hi> with Lord
                    Brougham (1855); an <hi rend="italic">Essay on the Stability of a given State of
                        Motion,</hi> which won the Adams’ prize in 1877; and treatises on the <hi
                        rend="italic">Dynamics of Rigid Bodies,</hi> on <hi rend="italic">Analytical
                        Statics,</hi> and on the <hi rend="italic">Dynamics of a Particle.</hi> He
                    died at Cambridge on the 7th of June 1907.</p>
