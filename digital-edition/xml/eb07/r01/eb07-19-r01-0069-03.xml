<p><label>RANGAMUTTY</label>
a town and district of Hindustan, in the north-western extremity of Bengal, situated about the twenty-sixth degree of north latitude, and formerly included in the extensive kingdom of Kamroop. After its subjugation by the Mahommedans, about the middle of the seventeenth century, it was annexed to the collectorship of Rungpore. It has for its boundaries Bootan on the north, the Gaιτow Hills on the south, Assam on the east, and Cooch Bahar and Rungpoor on the west. It is a wild uncultivated country, stretching on both sides of the Brahmaputra, easterly, to the confines of Assam. Many parts of the country, the area of which is 2620 square miles, might be rendered extremely productive, although at present they yield little more than a few elephants, which are caught annually in the neighbouring forests. The chief river is the Brahmaputra, which nearly intersects the country ; and the principal towns are Rangamutty and Goalporah. The former is situated near the hills, between two tributary streams of the Brahmaputra. It has declined from its ancient prosperity. Long. 90. E. Lat. 26. 9. N.</p>
