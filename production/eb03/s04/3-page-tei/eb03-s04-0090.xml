Sir Hans was no leſs liberal to other learned bodies. He had no sooner purchaſed the manor of Chelſea, than he gave the company of apothecaries the entire freehold of their botanical garden there, upon condition only that they ſhould preſent yearly to the Royal Society fifty new plants, till the number ſhould amount to 2000 @@(A). He gave beſides ſeveral other conſiderable donations for the improvement of this garden ; the ſituation of which, on the banks of the Thames, and in the neighbourhood of the capital, was ſuch as to render it uſeful in two reſpects : Firſt, by producing the moſt rare medicinal plants ; and, ſecondly, by ſerving as an excellent ſchool for young botaniſts ; an advantage which he himſelf had derived from it in the early part of his life.</p><p>The death of Sir Iſaac Newton, which happened in 1727, made way for the advancement of Sir Hans to the preſidency of the Royal Society. He had been vice-preſident, and frequently sat in the chair for that great man ; and by his long connection with this learned body he had contracted ſo ſtrong an affection for it, that he made them a preſent of an hundred guineas, cauſed a curious buſt of King Charles II. its founder, to be erected in the great hall where it met, and, as is ſaid, was very inſtrumental in procuring Sir Godfrey Copley’s benefaction of a medal of the value of five guineas, to be annually given as an honorary mark of diſtinction to the perſon who communicates the beſt experiments to the Society.</p><p>On his being raiſed to the chair, Sir Hans laid aſide all thoughts of further promotion, and applied himſelf wholly to the faithful diſcharge of the duties of the offices which he enjoyed. In this laudable occupation he employed his time from 1727 to 1740, when, at the age of fourſcore, he formed a reſolution of quitting the ſervice of the public, and of living for himſelf. With this view he reſigned the preſidency of the Royal Society much againſt the inclination of that reſpectable body, who choſe Martin Folkes, Eſq; to ſucceed him, and in a public assembly thanked him for the great and eminent ſervices he had rendered them. In the month of January 1741, he began to remove his library, and his cabinet of rarities, from his houſe in Bloomſbury to that at Chelſea ; and on the 12th of March following, having ſettled all his affairs, he retired thither himſelf, to enjoy in peaceful tranquillity the remains of a well-ſpent</p><p>life. He did not, however, bury himſelf in that ſolitude which excludes men from ſociety. He received at Chelſea, as he had done in London, the viſits of people of diſtinction, of all learned foreigners, and of the royal family, who fometimes did him the honour to wait on him ; but, what was ſtill more to his praiſe, he never refuſed admittance or advice to rich or poor who came to conſult him concerning their health. Not contented with this contracted method of doing good, he now, during his retreat, preſented to the public ſuch uſeful remedies as ſucceſs had warranted, during the courſe of a long continued practice. Among theſe is the efficacious redeipt for diſtempers in the eyes, and his remedy for the bite of a mad dog.</p><p>During the whole courſe of his life, Sir Hans had lived with ſo much temperance, as had preſerved him from feeling the infirmities of old age ; but in his 90th. year he began to complain of pains, and to be ſenſible of an univerſal decay. He was often heard to say, that the approach of death brought no terrors along with it ; that he had long expected the ſtroke ; and that he was prepared to receive it whenever the great Author of his being ſhould think fit. After a ſhort illneſs of three days, he died on the 11th of January 1752, and was interred on the 18th at Chelſea, in the ſame vault with his lady, the ſolemnity being attended with the greateſt concourſe of people, of all ranks and conditions, that had ever been ſeen before on the like occasion.</p><p>Sir Hans being extremely ſolicitous left his cabinet of curioſities, which he had taken ſo much pains to collect, ſhould be again diſſipated at his death, and being at the ſame time unwilling that ſo large a portion of his fortune ſhould be loſt to his children, he bequeathed it to the public, on condition that L. 20,000 ſhould be made good by parliament to his family. This ſum, though large in appearance, was ſcarcely more than the intrinſic value of the gold and ſilver medals, the ores and precious ſtones that were found in it ; for in his laſt will he declares, that the firſt coſt of the whole amounted at leaſt to L. 50,000. Beſides his library, conſiſting of more than 50,000 volumes, 347 of which were illuſtrated with cuts finely engraven and coloured from nature, there were 3560 manuſcripts, and an infinite number of rare and curious works of every kind. The parliament accepted the legacy, and fulfilled the conditions.</p><p>SLOANEA, in botany: A genus of plants belonging to the claſs of <hi rend="italic">polyandria,</hi> and order of <hi rend="italic">monogynia ;</hi> and in the natural ſyſtem ranging under the 50th order, A<hi rend="italic">mentaceae.</hi> The corolla is pentapetalous ; the calyx pentaphyllous and deciduous ; the ſtigma is</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a)</hi> This garden was firſt eſtabliſhed by the company in 1673 ; and having after that period been stocked by them with a great variety of plants, for the improvement of botany, Sir Hans, in order to encourage ſo ſerviceable an undertaking, granted to the company the inheritance of it, being part of his eſtate and manor of Chelſea, on condition that it ſhould be for ever preſerved as a physic garden. As a proof of its being ſo maintained, he obliged the company, in conſideration of the ſaid grant, to preſent yearly to the Royal Society, in one of their weekly meetings, fifty ſpecimens of plants that had grown in the garden the preceding year, and which were all to be specifically diſtinct from each other, until the number of two thouſand ſhould be completed. This number was completed in the year 1761. In 1733 the company erected a marble ſtatue of Sir Hans, executed by Ryſbrac, which is placed upon a pedeſtal in the centre of the garden, with a Latin inſcription, expreſſing his donation, and the deſign, and advantages of it.</p></body></text></TEI>
