<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jetties.—</span><span class="font1">A bar being caused by the littoral drift, and by the impotence of the expanded current to scour the&nbsp;channel over it to the same depth as elsewhere, it is necessary either to arrest the drift or to concentrate the current&nbsp;across the bar. The drift, which comes from the direction&nbsp;of the prevalent winds, might be temporarily arrested by&nbsp;projecting a groyne, or jetty, from the shore on the windward side of the outlet. The material, however, carried&nbsp;along the coast would accumulate against the jetty, and&nbsp;eventually form a bar beyond, or, sweeping round the end&nbsp;of the jetty,, deposit in the channel under its shelter.&nbsp;Accordingly a second jetty is added, on the opposite side&nbsp;of the outlet, to direct and concentrate the current over&nbsp;the bar, and thus increase the depth of the channel, and&nbsp;also to drive into deep water any material that may be&nbsp;carried round the windward jetty, or convey it within the&nbsp;influence of any littoral current farther out. The jetties&nbsp;are either made parallel, or slightly diverging, so as to&nbsp;form a sort of continuation of the banks of the river&nbsp;across the beach, or they are commenced far apart and&nbsp;made to converge towards their extremities, so as to admit&nbsp;a larger volume of tidal water and concentrate the flow&nbsp;into a narrow channel over the bar. The parallel jetty&nbsp;system has been adopted for the new outlet of the Maas&nbsp;(fig. 13), the mouth of the Adour near Bayonne (fig. 16),&nbsp;and the mouths of the Wear at Sunderland, the Yare at&nbsp;Yarmouth, and the Ouse at Newhaven; whilst the converging jetty system has been carried out at Charleston&nbsp;(figs. 17 and 18) and Aberdeen, and at the mouths of the&nbsp;Liffey, the Tyne (fig. 8), and the Tees.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The ordinary form of jetty is a timber pier resting upon a base of rubble stone, like the jetties of the North Sea&nbsp;jetty harbours of Calais, Dunkirk, and Ostend, so that the&nbsp;solid lower portion may concentrate the ebb, whilst the open&nbsp;upper portion permits the passage of the littoral currents&nbsp;in order that a rapid advance of the foreshore may be prevented. Such structures, however, simply delay, and do&nbsp;not stop, the advance of the foreshore, as manifested at&nbsp;Newhaven and Dunkirk, where the accumulation of shingle&nbsp;in the one case and of sand in the other brought low-water mark out to the extremities of their western jetties.&nbsp;The solid northern jetties of the Wear and the Yare have&nbsp;naturally produced a similar advance of their northern&nbsp;beaches, both being exposed to a north-easterly drift.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A special form of jetty has been constructed at the mouth of the Adour to combine the advantages of open&nbsp;and closed jetties. These jetties consist of a row of&nbsp;cylindrical columns placed at intervals and carrying iron&nbsp;girders on the top. Grooves are formed at the sides of&nbsp;the columns, down which panels can be lowered from the&nbsp;roadway above to confine the issuing current, whilst when&nbsp;the panels are open the spaces between the columns&nbsp;admit the flood tide and the passage of the currents.&nbsp;Nevertheless there are indications of an advance of the&nbsp;foreshore ; the sand passing through the spaces in the&nbsp;northern jetty has encroached upon the channel, and the&nbsp;depths are reduced beyond the end of the jetties (fig. 16).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most important examples of training jetties, including converging jetties, have been made solid, though sometimes they have not been raised to high-water level&nbsp;at their outer ends, in order to provide for the freer admission of the flood tide. The converging jetties, or walls,&nbsp;at the mouth of the Liffey consist of mounds of rubble&nbsp;stone, and the outer portion of the northern jetty is only&nbsp;raised to half-tide level. The jetties at the mouth of the&nbsp;Maas (figs. 13 and 15) are formed of fascine mattresses;&nbsp;and the Charleston jetties (figs. 17 and 18) are similar in&nbsp;construction ; in both these cases the outer portions have&nbsp;not been raised above half-tide level. The converging&nbsp;jetties or piers at Aberdeen, the Tyne (fig. 8), and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Tees are in reality breakwaters,</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> though they serve the same purpose of protecting the entrance channels from&nbsp;the littoral drift, and promoting scour over the bar, as the&nbsp;less solid structures at Dublin and Charleston. The&nbsp;Tees breakwaters are random mounds of slag ; the Aberdeen breakwaters at the mouth of the Dee are upright&nbsp;walls of concrete ; and the Tynemouth piers are masonry&nbsp;and concrete-block walls upon a rubble foundation. The&nbsp;breakwaters afford a much better shelter for vessels and&nbsp;for dredging operations, but the lower fascine-work jetties&nbsp;at the mouth of the Maas are equally effective in directing&nbsp;the current.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Training Walls.—</span><span class="font1">The wandering shallow channel of a river through a wide sandy estuary may be improved by&nbsp;training the channel, in a suitable direction, by means of&nbsp;longitudinal mounds of rubble stone, commonly termed&nbsp;training walls. These walls fix the channel and prevent&nbsp;the current eroding the sandbanks and thus changing its&nbsp;course. Moreover, by guiding the channel into a more&nbsp;direct line, making the ebb and flow follow the same&nbsp;course, and concentrating the current, the scouring capacity of the stream is increased and the channel is deepened.&nbsp;The flood tide ascends the trained channel more readily,&nbsp;and therefore is able to extend its influence farther up ;&nbsp;whilst the ebb tide flows out of the improved and deepened&nbsp;channel earlier, and thus lowers the low-water line and&nbsp;increases the tidal capacity in the channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The trained channel must be gradually widened out and carried into deep water, otherwise the abrupt expansion&nbsp;which occurs beyond the ends of the training walls would&nbsp;so enfeeble the ebbing current that a shallow shifting&nbsp;channel would be formed only a short distance below.&nbsp;Training walls which stop in the middle of a wide sandy&nbsp;estuary, like the walls carried out on the Seine (fig. 10)&nbsp;and the Ribble, can be only regarded as incomplete&nbsp;works, which sooner or later will have to be extended if&nbsp;the full benefit of a trained channel is to be realized.&nbsp;When the channel is to follow close along one shore of the&nbsp;estuary, a single training wall on the outer side is sufficient ; and a single wall is sometimes adequate for maintaining a channel in the middle of an estuary, when&nbsp;placed along the concave side of a bend.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The proper width between the training walls depends upon the fall, the tidal range, and the fresh-water discharge, and should gradually increase down stream so as&nbsp;to admit as much tidal water as possible with a steady&nbsp;flow. As the scour of the fresh-water discharge is greater&nbsp;with a contracted channel, the tendency is to place the&nbsp;training walls too close together, which, though improving&nbsp;the depth in the channel between the walls, reduces the&nbsp;volume of tidal water that can get up the channel and&nbsp;thus compromises the maintenance of the outlet beyond the&nbsp;walls. The training walls on the Seine and on the Ribble,&nbsp;whilst improving the trained channels, have been prejudicial to the channels beyond ; and an extension of the&nbsp;works has been authorized on the Ribble. The widths also&nbsp;adopted between these walls are not compatible with an&nbsp;adequate widening out towards their outlet for the free&nbsp;admission of the flood tide, so that these estuaries will&nbsp;eventually be deficient in tidal capacity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The training of a wandering channel is always beneficial to the maintenance and depth of the channel. The&nbsp;wanderings, however, of the channel, which are thus&nbsp;arrested, though very prejudicial to navigation, are advantageous in preventing the silting up of an estuary by the&nbsp;constant erosion and stirring up of the sandbanks which&nbsp;they effect in shifting their position, and which they&nbsp;carry by gradual stages throughout the whole of the</span></p>
