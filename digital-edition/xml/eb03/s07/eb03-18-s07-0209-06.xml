It appeared again in 1528, or 1529, at which time alone it ſpread itſelf to the Netherlands and Germany : a circumſtance which shows the impropriety of calling it <hi rend="italic">the Engliſh ſweat,</hi> in Latin s <hi rend="italic">udοr Anglicanus ;</hi> beſides, Sennertus takes notice, that it ſpread as far as Denmark, Norway, and France. It raged again in 1548. And the laſt return of it in London was in 1551, when it was ſo violent as in one day to take off 120 of the inhabitants of Weſtminſter. Some were ſeized abroad, and cut off in the road, others at home. Some when awake, others when faſt aſleep. Some died in a moment, and others in one, two, three, four, or more hours after they began to ſweat.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
