<p><span class="font1">the first Council of Orleans ordered that the three days preceding Ascension Day should be celebrated as rogatioii days with fasting and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rogationes.</span><span class="font1"> AU work was to be suspended&nbsp;that all might join in the processions. Lco III. (pope 795-816)&nbsp;introduced rogation days, but without the fasting, at Rome.&nbsp;St Augustine had earlier introduced the custom into the English&nbsp;Church, learning it on his way through Gaul. The Council of&nbsp;Clovesho in 747 confirmed Augustine’s injunction, and ordered&nbsp;that the rogation days be kept up “ according to the way of our&nbsp;fathers.” The place-name “ Gospel Oak,” which occurs in&nbsp;London and elsewhere, is a relic of these rogation processions,&nbsp;the gospel of the day being read at the foot of the finest oak&nbsp;the parish boasted. After the Reformation the processions&nbsp;gradually ceased to be ecclesiastical in England, and are now&nbsp;practically secularized into the perambulation of the parish&nbsp;boundaries on or about Ascension Day.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROGER I. (1031-1101), ruler of Sicily, was the youngest son of Tancred of HauteviUe. He arrived in Southern Italy soon&nbsp;after 1057. Malaterra, who compares Robert Guiscard (see&nbsp;GnsCARD, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robert)</span><span class="font1"> and his brother to “ Joseph and Benjamin&nbsp;of old,” says of Roger: “ He was a youth of the greatest beauty,&nbsp;of lofty stature, of graceful shape, most eloquent in speech and&nbsp;cool in counsel. He was far-seeing in arranging aU his actions,&nbsp;pleasant and merry aU with men; strong and brave, and furious&nbsp;in battle.” He shared with Robert Guiscard the conquest of&nbsp;Calabria, and in a treaty of 1062 the brothers in dividing the&nbsp;conquest apparently made a kind of “ condominium ” by&nbsp;which either was to have half of every castle and town in&nbsp;Calabria.@@<sup>1</sup> Robert now resolved to employ Roger’s genius in&nbsp;reducing Sicily, which contained, besides the Moslems, numerous&nbsp;Greek Christians subject to Arab princes who had become all&nbsp;but independent of the sultan of Tunis. In May 1061 the&nbsp;brothers crossed from Reggio and captured Messina. After&nbsp;Palcrmo had been taken in January 1072 Robert Guiscard, as&nbsp;suzerain, invested Roger as count of Sicily, but retained Palermo,&nbsp;half of Messina and the north-east portion (the VaI Demone).&nbsp;Not till 1085, however, was Roger able to undertake a systematic crusade. In March 1086 Syracuse surrendered, and&nbsp;when in February 1091 Noto yielded the conquest was complete.&nbsp;Much of Robert’s success had been due to Roger’s support.&nbsp;Similarly the latter supported Duke Roger, his nephew, against&nbsp;Bohemund, Capua and his rebels, and the real leadership&nbsp;of the Hautevilles passed to the Sicilian count. In return&nbsp;for his aid against Bohemund and his rebels the duke surrendered to his uncle in 1085 his share in the castles of Calabria,&nbsp;and in 1091 the half of Palermo. Roger’s rule in Sicily was&nbsp;more real than Robert Guiscard’s in Italy. At the enfeoffments of 1072 and 1092 no great undivided fiefs were created,&nbsp;and the mixed Norman, French and Italian vassals owed&nbsp;their benefices to the count. No feudal revolt of importance&nbsp;therefore troubled Roger. Politically supreme, the count&nbsp;became master of the insular Church. While he gave full&nbsp;toleration to the Greek Churches, he created new Latin bishoprics at Syracuse and Girgenti and elsewhere, nominating the&nbsp;bishops personally, while he turned the archbishopric of Palermo&nbsp;into a Catholic see. The Papacy, favouring a prince who had&nbsp;recovered Sicily from Greeks and Moslems, granted to him&nbsp;and his heirs in 1098 the Apostolic Legateship in the island.&nbsp;Roger practised general toleration to Arabs and Greeks, allowing&nbsp;to each race the expansion of its own civilization. In the&nbsp;cities the Moslems, who had generally secured such terms of&nbsp;surrender, retained their mosques, their kadis, and freedom&nbsp;of trade; in the country, however, they became serfs. He&nbsp;drew from the Moslems the mass of his infantry, and St Anselm&nbsp;visiting him at the siege of Capua, 1098, found “ the brown&nbsp;tents of the Arabs innumerable.” Nevertheless the Latin&nbsp;element began to prevail with the Lombards and other Italians&nbsp;who flocked into the island in the wake of the conquest, and&nbsp;the conquest of Sicily was decisive in the steady decline from&nbsp;this time of Mahommedan Dower in the western Mediterranean.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1">ROGER IL (1093-1154), king of Sicily, son of the preceding, began personally to rule in 1112, and from the first aimed&nbsp;at uniting the whole of the Norman conquests in Italy. In&nbsp;June 1127, William, duke of Apulia, grandson of Robert Guis-card, died childless, having apparently made some vague&nbsp;promise of the succession to Roger. In any case Roger claimed&nbsp;at once, not only all the IIautevillc possessions, but also the&nbsp;overlordship of Capua, for which Richard II. in 1098 had sworn&nbsp;homage to Duke Roger. The union of Sicily and Apulia,&nbsp;however, was resisted by Honurius II. and by the subjects of&nbsp;the duchy itself, averse from any strong ducal power, and the&nbsp;pope at Capua (Dec. 1127) preached a crusade against the&nbsp;claimant, setting against him Robert II. of Capua and Ranulf&nbsp;of Alife, or Avellino, brother-in-law of Roger, who proved&nbsp;himself the real leader of the revolt. The coalition, however,&nbsp;failed, and in August 1128 Honorius invested Roger at Benc-vento as duke of Apulia. The baronial resistance, which was&nbsp;backed by Naples, Bari, Salerno and other cities, whose aim&nbsp;was civic freedom, also gave way, and at Melfi (Sept. 1129)&nbsp;Roger was generally recognized as duke by Naples, Capua and&nbsp;the rest. He began at once to enforce order in the Hautevillc&nbsp;possessions, where the ducal power had long been falling to&nbsp;pieces. For the binding together of all his states the royal&nbsp;name seemed essential, and the death of Honorius in February&nbsp;1130, followed by a double election, seemed the decisive moment.&nbsp;While Innocent II. fled to France, Roger, with deep design, supported Anacletus II. The price was a crown, and on the 27th&nbsp;of September 1130 a bull of Anacletus made Roger king of&nbsp;Sicily. He was crowned in Palermo on the 25th of December&nbsp;1130.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This plunged Roger into a ten years’ war. Bernard of Clairvaux, Innocent’s champion, built up against Anacletus&nbsp;and his “ half heathen king ” a coalition joined by Louis VI.&nbsp;of France, Henry I. of England and the emperor Lothar. Meanwhile the forces of revolt in South Italy drew to a head again.&nbsp;The rebels under Ranulf shamefully defeated the king at Nocera&nbsp;on the 24th of July 1132. Nevertheless, by July 1134 his&nbsp;terrific energy and the savagery of his Saracen troops forced&nbsp;Ranulf, Sergius, duke of Naples, and the rebels to submit,&nbsp;while Robert was expelled from Capua. Meanwhile Lothar’s&nbsp;contemplated attack upon Roger had gained the backing of&nbsp;Pisa, Genoa and the Greek emperor, all of whom feared the&nbsp;growth of a powerful Norman kingdom. In February 1137&nbsp;Lothar began to move south and was joined by Ranulf and&nbsp;the rebels; in June he besieged and took Bari. At San Severino,&nbsp;after a victorious campaign, he and the pope jointly invested&nbsp;Ranulf as duke of Apulia (Aug. 1137), and the emperor then&nbsp;retired to Germany. Roger, freed from the utmost danger,&nbsp;recovered ground, sacked Capua and forced Sergius to acknowledge him as overlord of Naples. At Rignano the indomitable&nbsp;Ranulf again utterly defeated the king, but in April 1139&nbsp;Ranulf died, leaving none to oppose Roger, who subdued pitilessly the last of the rebels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The death of Anaclctus (25 Jan. 1138) determined Roger to seek the confirmation of his title from Innocent. The&nbsp;latter, invading the kingdom with a large army, was skilfully&nbsp;ambushed at Galuccio on the Garigliano (22 July 1139). This&nbsp;secured the king’s object; on the 25th July the pope invested&nbsp;him as “ Rex Siciliae ducatus Apuliae et principatus Capuac.”&nbsp;The boundaries of the “ regno” were finally fixed, by a truce&nbsp;with the pope in October 1144, at a line south of the Tronto&nbsp;and east of Tcrracina and Ceprano..</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Roger, now become one of the greatest kings »in Europe, made Sicily the leading maritime power in the Mediterranean.&nbsp;A powerful fleet was built up under several “ admirals,” </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">or</span></p>
