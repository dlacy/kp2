<p><span class="font2">his stipulation—that would lie against him in the event of his failure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A second form of contract that came into use to a considerable extent in the latter half of the Republic is what is commonly called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ltieral</span><span class="font2"> <sup>thc</sup> ^<sup>tera</sup>* contract, or, as Gaius phrases it with greater&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">contract,</span><span class="font2"> accuracy, the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nomen transscripticium.<sup>@@1</sup> 1</span><span class="font2">Notwithstanding&nbsp;the prolific literature of which it has been the subject, it&nbsp;must be admitted that in many points our knowledge of it is&nbsp;incomplete and uncertain. The prevalent opinion, formed before&nbsp;the discovery of the Verona MS. had made known Gaius’s description&nbsp;of it, and almost universally adhered to ever since, is that such&nbsp;contracts were created by entries in the account-books which the&nbsp;censors insisted that all citizens of any means should keep with&nbsp;scrupulous regularity. They arc often alluded to by the lay writers;&nbsp;but the text principally relied on is what remains of Cicero’s speech&nbsp;for the player Roscius. From the tenor of the argument in that&nbsp;case, and incidental remarks elsewhere, the conclusion has been&nbsp;formed that a citizen who made an entry in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">codex—</span><span class="font2">whether of&nbsp;the nature of a cash-book or a ledger is much disputed—to the debit&nbsp;of another, thereby made the latter his debtor for a sum recoverable&nbsp;by an </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">actio certae creditae pecuniae,</span><span class="font2"> Gaius in his description of the&nbsp;contract does not mention the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">codices\</span><span class="font2"> but his account is not inconsistent with the notion that the entries </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(nomina)</span><span class="font2"> of which he speaks&nbsp;were made in them. He says that those entries were of two sorts,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nomina arcaria</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nomina transscripticia.</span><span class="font2"> The former were&nbsp;entries of cash advances; and of them he observes that they did&nbsp;not create obligation, but only served as evidence of one already&nbsp;created by payment to and receipt of the money by the borrower.&nbsp;These entries were posted periodically (usually each month)&nbsp;from a day-book </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(adversaria,),</span><span class="font2"> and there were distinct pages in the&nbsp;codex for what was thus paid out of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">area (expensum)</span><span class="font2"> and what&nbsp;was paid in. Of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nomina transscripticia</span><span class="font2"> Gaius says that there&nbsp;were two varieties, the entry transcribed from thing to person&nbsp;and that transcribed from one person to another, and that both&nbsp;of them were not probative merely but creative of obligation. The&nbsp;first was effected by a creditor (A) entering to the credit of his&nbsp;debtor (B) the liquidated amount of what the latter was already&nbsp;owing as the price of something purchased, the rent of a house&nbsp;leased, the value of work done, or the like, and then on the opposite&nbsp;page of the codex debiting him with same sum as </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">expensum.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">The second was effected by A transcribing B’s debt in a similar way&nbsp;to ¿he debit of a third party (C), hitherto a debtor of B’s, and who&nbsp;consented to the transaction—A at the same time crediting B&nbsp;with the sum thus booked against C, and B in his books both&nbsp;crediting C with it </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(acceptilatio)</span><span class="font2"> and marking it as paid to A </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ex-pensilalio).</span><span class="font2"> These </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nomina transscripticia</span><span class="font2"> were purely fictitious&nbsp;entries so far as any passing of money was concerned, though&nbsp;they had to be made by the direction </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(jussus)</span><span class="font2"> of the person made&nbsp;chargeable as debtor. Corresponding entries in the debtor’s own</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">codex, though usual, do not seem to have been necessary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">All this at first sight seems just a series of book-keeping operations. But it was much more than that for the Roman citizens who first had recourse to it. There was a time, as formerly stated,&nbsp;when sale, and lease and the like, so long as they stood on their&nbsp;own merits, created no obligation enforceable at law, however much&nbsp;it might be binding as a duty to Fides or (as moderns would say)&nbsp;in the forum of conscience; to found an action at law it required&nbsp;to be clothed in some form approved by the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile.</span><span class="font2"> The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">nexum&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">may possibly have been one of those forms, the vendee or tenant&nbsp;being fictitiously dealt with as borrower of the price or rent due&nbsp;under his purchase or lease; the stipulation was another, the obligation to pay the price or rent being made legally binding by its&nbsp;embodiment in formal question and answer. But stipulation was&nbsp;competent only between persons who were face to face, whereas&nbsp;expensilation was competent also as between persons at a&nbsp;distance from each other. This of itself gave expensilation—&nbsp;which, originally at least, was as much a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">negotium juris' civilis&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sponsio</span><span class="font2">—one advantage over stipulation. But it had also&nbsp;a further advantage, which was not affected by the subsequent&nbsp;recognition of the real and consensual contracts as productive of&nbsp;legal obligation on their own merits: it enabled subsequent transcription of debts from one person to another to be effected. This&nbsp;last must have been of infinite convenience in commerce, not&nbsp;only by enabling traders to dispense with a reserve of coin, but&nbsp;by obviating the risks attending the transit of money over long</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">distances. It was this that led, as Thcophilus says was the case, to the conversion even of stipulatory obligations into book-debts;&nbsp;it was not that thereby the creditor obtained a tighter hold over&nbsp;his debtor, but that an obligation was obtained from him which in&nbsp;a sense was negotiable and therefore more valuable. But in other&nbsp;respects it was much more restricted than stipulation. Thus it&nbsp;only applied to money debts; it did not admit of conditions (though&nbsp;it did admit of a term); and it was never available to peregrins,&nbsp;though the Sabinians proposed that transcription </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a re in personam&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">should be binding on them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The evolution of the four purely consensual contracts—sale, location, partnership and mandate—supplies matter for one of the&nbsp;most interesting chapters in the whole history of the law. <sub>Coa</sub>.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But, as it is impossible in such an article as this to attempt </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">sensual </span><span class="font2">to mark the successive stages in the progress of all of them, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">contracts.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">we shall confine ourselves to sale. The others did not and&nbsp;could not follow identically the same course: location ran most&nbsp;nearly parallel with sale; but partnership and mandate, from their&nbsp;nature, not only started at a different point from the other two,&nbsp;but reached </span><span class="font1">the </span><span class="font2">same goal with them—that of becoming productive&nbsp;of obligation simply on the strength of consent interchanged by the&nbsp;parties—by paths that were sometimes far apart. Nevertheless, a&nbsp;sketch of the history of the origin of the contract of sale may be&nbsp;sufficient to indicate generally some of the milestones that were&nbsp;successively passed by all four.<sup>@@2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Going back as far as history carries us, we meet with it under the names of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">emptio</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">venditio,</span><span class="font2"> but meaning no more than barter;&nbsp;for </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">emere</span><span class="font2">originally signified simply<sup>4</sup>To take ” or “ acquire ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">contracts&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(accipere).</span><span class="font2"> Sheep and cattle </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(pecus,</span><span class="font2"> hence </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pecunia)</span><span class="font2"> may <sub>ot sa/e&nbsp;</sub>for a time have been a very usual article of exchange on one&nbsp;side, and then came raw metal weighed in the scales. But it was still&nbsp;exchange, instant delivery of goods on one sideagainst simultaneous&nbsp;delivery of so many pounds weight of copper on the other. With&nbsp;the reforms of Servius Tullius, as we have seen, came the distinction&nbsp;between </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi,</span><span class="font2"> and with it a regulated&nbsp;mancipation of the former. It was still barter; but along with it&nbsp;arose an obligation on the part of the transferrer of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">to warrant the transferee against eviction—a warranty that was&nbsp;implied in the mancipation. Whether this rule obtained from the&nbsp;first or was the growth of custom it is impossible to say; but it is&nbsp;probable that it was the XII. Tables which fixed that the measure&nbsp;of the transferrer’s liability to the transferee in the event of eviction&nbsp;should be double the amount of the price. Equally impossible is it&nbsp;to say when the practice arose of embodying declarations, assurances&nbsp;and so forth in the mancipation </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(leges mancipii),</span><span class="font2"> which were held&nbsp;binding on the strength of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">negotium juris civilis</span><span class="font2"> in which they&nbsp;were clothed. They received statutory sanction in the Tables, in&nbsp;the words already referred to more than once—“ cum nexum faciet&nbsp;mancipiumque, uti lingua nuncupassit, ita jus esto,” which means in&nbsp;effect “ whatever shall by word of mouth be declared by the parties&nbsp;in the course of a transaction </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">per aes et libram</span><span class="font2"> in definition of its&nbsp;terms shall be law as between them.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The substitution, by or soon after the decemvirs, of coined money, that was to be counted, for rough metal that had been weighed,&nbsp;converted the object of transfer on one side into price </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(pretium),</span><span class="font2"> as&nbsp;distinguished from article of purchase </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(merx)</span><span class="font2"> on the other; and sale&nbsp;thus became distinct from barter. In contemplation of the separation of the mancipation and the price-paying, and the transition of&nbsp;the former into a merely imaginary sale, the decemvirs enacted&nbsp;that, mancipation notwithstanding, the property of what was sold&nbsp;should not pass to the purchaser until the price had been paid or&nbsp;security by sureties </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(vaaes)</span><span class="font2"> given for it to the vendor; and it was&nbsp;probably bv the interpretation of the pontiffs that to this was added&nbsp;the rule—that until the price was paid no liability for eviction should&nbsp;attach to the transferrer (or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">auctor).</span><span class="font2"> The reason perhaps of the&nbsp;provision on this point in the XII. Tables was that a vendor who had&nbsp;niancipated or delivered a thing sold by him before receiving the&nbsp;price had no action to enforce payment of the latter; and in such&nbsp;circumstances it was thought but right to give him the opportunity&nbsp;of getting back the thing itself by a real action. It might be,&nbsp;however, that the price had been paid, and yet the vendor refused&nbsp;to mancipate. It was long, apparently, before the purchaser could&nbsp;in such a case compel him to do so. After the introduction of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio per condictionem</span><span class="font2"> he (the purchaser) had undoubtedly the&nbsp;power to recover the money on the ground of the vendor’s unjustifiable enrichment—that the latter had got it for a consideration&nbsp;which had failed </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(causa data, causa non secuta)</span><span class="font2">; and it is possible&nbsp;that before that he had a similar remedy </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">per judicis postulationem</span><span class="font2"> or&nbsp;by an action </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">in factum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Down to this point, therefore, say the beginning of the 6th century, there were several obligations consequent on sale of a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">res&nbsp;mancipi;</span><span class="font2"> but not one-of them arose directly out of the sale itself,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
