<p><span class="font1">indicated by their shape, are bottom-fishes, living on flat sandy ground, generally at no great distance from the coast or the&nbsp;surface. They lead a sedentary life, progressing, like the flatfishes, by an undulatory motion of the greatly extended pectoral&nbsp;fins, the thin slender tail having lost the function of an organ of&nbsp;locomotion, and acting merely as a rudder. They arc carnivorous and feed exclusively on molluscs, crustaceans and fishes.&nbsp;Some of the species possess a much larger and more pointed&nbsp;snout than the others, and are popularly distinguished as&nbsp;“ skates.’’ The following are known as inhabitants of the&nbsp;British seas:—(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">) short-snouted species: (1) the thornback&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R.</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">claυata),</span><span class="font1"> (2) the homelyn or spotted ray (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">maculata),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(3) the starry ray </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(R. radiata),</span><span class="font1"> (4) the cuckoo or sandy ray&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span class="font1">. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">circularis); (b)</span><span class="font1"> long-snouted species: (5) the common skate&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(R. batis), </span><span class="font1">(6) the flapper skate or jumbo skate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(R.macrorhynchus),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(7) the burton skate (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. alba),</span><span class="font1"> (8) and (9) the shagreen skates&nbsp;(</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. οxyrhynchus</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. fullonica).</span><span class="font1"> A few deep-sea species are&nbsp;known, including </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">R. abyssicola</span><span class="font1"> from 1588 fathoms off the coast&nbsp;of British Columbia. Most of the skates and rays are eaten,&nbsp;except during the breeding season; and even the young of the&nbsp;former are esteemed as food. The skates attain to a much&nbsp;larger size than the rays, viz. to a width of 6 ft. and a weight of&nbsp;400 and 5∞ lb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The members of the fifth family, Trygonidae or sting-rays, are distinguished from the rays proper by having the vertical fins&nbsp;replaced by a strong spine attached to the upper side of the tail.&nbsp;Some fifty species are known, which inhabit tropical more than&nbsp;temperate seas, some species being found in great tropical rivers&nbsp;over 1000 m. from the sea. The spine is barbed on the sides&nbsp;and is a most effective weapon of defence; by lashing the tail&nbsp;in every direction the sting-rays can inflict dangerous or at least&nbsp;extremely painful wounds. The danger arises from the lacerated&nbsp;nature of the wound rather than from any specially poisonous&nbsp;property of the mucus inoculated. Generally only one or two&nbsp;spines are developed. Sting-rays attain to about the same size&nbsp;as the skates and are eaten on the coasts of the Mediterranean&nbsp;and elsewhere. One species </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Trygon pastinaca)</span><span class="font1"> is not rarely&nbsp;found in the North Atlantic and extends northwards to the&nbsp;coasts of Ireland, England and Norway.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rays of the sixth and last family, Mylíobatidae, are popularly known under various names, such as “ devil-fishes,’’ “ sea-devils ” and “eagle-rays.” In them the dilatation of the&nbsp;body, or rather the development of the pectoral fins, is carried to&nbsp;an extreme, whilst the tail is very thin and sometimes long like&nbsp;a whip-cord (fig. 3). Caudal spines are generally present and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">similar to those of the sting-rays. In the enormous “ sea-devils,’’ sometimes classed as a separate family (Mobulidae), the anterior&nbsp;part of the pectoral fin is detached and forms a “ cephalic ” lobe&nbsp;or pair of lobes in front of the snout. The dentition consists of&nbsp;perfectly flat molars, adapted for crushing hard substances. In&nbsp;some of the eagle-rays the molars arc large and tessellated (fig. 4),</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in others extremely small. Of the twenty-seven species which are known, from tropical and temperate scas, the majority attain&nbsp;a very large and some an enormous size: one mentioned by Risso,&nbsp;which was taken at Messina, weighed 1250 ℔. A foetus taken&nbsp;from the uterus of the mother (all eagle-rays are viviparous),&nbsp;captured at Jamaica and preserved in the British Museum, is 5 ft.&nbsp;broad and weighed 20 ℔. The mother measured 15 ft. in width&nbsp;and as many in length, and was between 3 and 4 ft. thick. At&nbsp;Jamaica, where these rays are well known under the name of&nbsp;“ devil-fishes, ’’ they are frequently attacked for sport’s sake,&nbsp;but their capture is uncertain and sometimes attended with&nbsp;danger. The eagle-ray of the Mediterranean and Atlantic&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Myliobatis aquila)</span><span class="font1"> is occasionally found off the British coasts.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAY (or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Wray,</span><span class="font1"> as he wrote his name till 1670), </span><span class="font0">JOHN</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1">(1628-1705), sometimes called the father of English natural history, was the son of the blacksmith of Black Notley near Braintree&nbsp;in Essex, where he was born on the 29th of November 1628,&nbsp;or, according to other authorities, some months earlier. From&nbsp;Braintree school he was sent at the age of sixteen to Catharine&nbsp;Hall, Cambridge, whence he removed to Trinity College after&nbsp;about one year and three-quarters. His tutor at Trinity was&nbsp;Dr James Duport (1606-1679), regius professor of Greek, and&nbsp;his intimate friend and fellow-pupil the celebrated Isaac Barrow.&nbsp;Ray was chosen minor fellow of Trinity in 1649, and in due&nbsp;course became a major fellow on proceeding to the master’s&nbsp;degree. He held many college offices, becoming successively&nbsp;lecturer in Greek (1651), mathematics (1653), and humanity (1655),&nbsp;praelector (1657), junior dean (1657), and college steward (1659&nbsp;and 1660); and according to the habit of the time, he was&nbsp;accustomed to preach in his college chapel and also at Great&nbsp;St Mary’s before the university, long before he took holy orders.&nbsp;Among his sermons preached before his ordination, which was&nbsp;not till the 23rd of December 1660, were the famous discourses&nbsp;on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Wisdom of God in the Creation,</span><span class="font1"> and on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chaos, Deluge&nbsp;and Dissolution of the World.</span><span class="font1"> Ray’s reputation was high also&nbsp;as a tutor; and he communicated his own passion for natural&nbsp;history to several pupils, of whom Francis Willughby is by far&nbsp;the most famous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Ray’s quiet college life closed when he found himself unable to subscribe to the Act of Uniformity of 1661, and was&nbsp;obliged to give up his fellowship in 1662, the year after Isaac&nbsp;Newton had entered the college. We are told by Dr Derham&nbsp;in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life</span><span class="font1"> of Ray that the reason of his refusal “ was not (as&nbsp;some have imagined) his having taken the 'Solemn League and&nbsp;Covenant,' for that he never did, and often declared that he&nbsp;ever thought it an unlawful oath; but he said he could not&nbsp;declare for those that had taken the oath that no obligation&nbsp;lay upon them, but feared there might.” From this time onwards he seems to have depended chiefly on the bounty of his&nbsp;pupil Willughby, who made Ray his constant companion while&nbsp;he lived, and at his death left him £60 a year, with the charge of&nbsp;educating his two sons.</span></p><div style="border-right:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
