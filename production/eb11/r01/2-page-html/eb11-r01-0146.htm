<p><span class="font1">yttria into two new bases which he called “erbia” and “ terbia,’’ and a true yttria, but in i860 N. J. Berlin denied the existence&nbsp;of Mosander's “erbia,” and gave this name to his “terbia.’’ The&nbsp;new erbia has itself proved to be a mixture. Marignac in 1878&nbsp;separated an ytterbia which was split by Nilson in 1879 into&nbsp;scandia (the metal of which proved to be identical with Mendelé-eff’s predicted eka-boron)and a new ytterbia, which, in turn, was&nbsp;separated by Urbain in 1907 into neoytterbia and lutecia&nbsp;(C. A. von Welsbach proposed for these elements the names aldebarianum and cassiopeium). Berlin’s erbia was also examined&nbsp;by Soret in 1878 and by Cleve in 1879; the new base then&nbsp;isolated, Soret’s X or Cleve's holmia, was split by Lecoq de&nbsp;Boisbaudran in 1886 into a true holmia and a new oxide dysprosia. The same erbia also yielded another base, thulia, to&nbsp;Cleve, in 1879, in addition to true erbia. The original erbia&nbsp;of Mosander was confirmed by M. A. Delafontaine in 1878 and&nbsp;renamed terbia; this base was split by Marignac in 1886 into&nbsp;gadolinia and true terbia. These relations are schematically&nbsp;shown below; the true earths are in italics, mixtures in Roman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Methods of Separation.—</span><span class="font1">The small proportions in which the rare earths occur in the mineral kingdom and the general intermixture of several of them renders their efficient separation&nbsp;a matter of much difficulty, which is increased by their striking&nbsp;chemical resemblances. While it is impossible to treat the&nbsp;separations in detail, a general indication of the procedure may&nbsp;be given. The first step is to separate the rare earths from the&nbsp;other components of the mineral. For this purpose the mineral&nbsp;is evaporated with sulphuric or hydrochloric acid, or fused with&nbsp;potassium bisulphate, and the residue extracted with water.&nbsp;The solution of chlorides or sulphates thus obtained is treated&nbsp;with sulphuretted hydrogen, to remove copper, bismuth and&nbsp;molybdenum, and the filtrate, after the ferrous iron has been&nbsp;oxidized with chlorine, is precipitated with oxalic acid. The&nbsp;oxalates (and also thorium oxalate) may be converted into&nbsp;oxides by direct heating, into nitrates by dissolving in nitric&nbsp;acid, or into hydroxides by boiling with potash solution. The&nbsp;thorium may be removed by treating the nitrate solution with&nbsp;hydrogen peroxide, and warming, whereupon it separates as&nbsp;thorium peroxide. The next step consists in neutralizing the&nbsp;nitric acid solution and then saturating with potassium sulphate.&nbsp;Double salts of the general formula R<sub>2</sub>(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>.3K<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> are formed,&nbsp;of which those of the cerium group are practically insoluble,&nbsp;of the terbium group soluble, and of the ytterbium group very&nbsp;soluble. The sulphates thus obtained may be reconverted&nbsp;into oxalates or oxides and the saturation with potassium&nbsp;sulphate repeated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To separate the individual metals many different methods have been proposed; these, however, depend on two principles, one, on&nbsp;the different basicities of the metals, the other, on the different&nbsp;solubilities of their salts. Bahr and Bunsen worked out a process&nbsp;of the first type, which utilized the fractional decomposition of the&nbsp;nitrates into oxides on heating. The mixed oxalates are converted&nbsp;into nitrates, which are then mixed with an alkali nitrate to lower&nbsp;the melting-point, and the mixture fused. The nitrates decompose&nbsp;in order of the basicities of the metals, and after a short fusion the&nbsp;residue is extracted with boiling water, and the basic salt which&nbsp;separates when the solution is cooled is filtered off. This contains&nbsp;the most negative metal; and the filtrate, after evaporation and a&nbsp;repetition of the fusion and extraction, may be caused to yield the&nbsp;other oxides. A second method, based on the same principle, con-sists in the fractional precipitation by some base, such as ammonia,&nbsp;soda, potash, aniline, &amp;c. The neutral nitrates are dissolved in&nbsp;water, and the base added in such a quantity to precipitate the&nbsp;oxides only partially and very slowly. Obviously the first deposit&nbsp;contains the least basic oxide, which by re-solution as nitrate and&nbsp;re-precipitation yields a purer product. To the filtrate from the&nbsp;first precipitate more of the base is added, and the second less basic&nbsp;oxide is thrown down. By repeating the process all the bases can&nbsp;be obtained more or less pure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Many processes depending upon the different solubilities of certain salts have been devised. They consist in forming the desired salt&nbsp;and fractionally crystallizing. The mother liquor is concentrated&nbsp;and crystallized, the crystals being added to the filtrate from a re-crystallization of the first deposit. These operations are repeated&nbsp;after the manner shown in the following scheme; the letter C&nbsp;denotes crystals, the M.L mother liquor, whilst a bracket means&nbsp;mixing before re-crystallization.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Obviously the fractions contain salts which increase in solubility as one passes from the left to right, and with sufficient care and patience this method permits a complete separation.&nbsp;The salts which have been used include the sulphates, nitrates,&nbsp;chromates, formates, oxalates and malonates. R. J. Meyer (</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zeit.&nbsp;anοrg.

James </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ibid.,</span><span class="font0"> 1907, 95,&nbsp;p. 181 ; 1908, 97, pp. 61, 205) formed the oxalates of the yttrium&nbsp;earths and dissolved them in dilute ammonia saturated with&nbsp;ammonium carbonate; by boiling this solution the earths are&nbsp;precipitated in the order yttrium, holmium and dysprosium, and&nbsp;erbium; he also fractionally crystallized the bromates (see, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.&nbsp;Jour.

<p><span class="font0">In order to determine whether any chosen method for separating these earths is really effective, it is necessary to analyse the fractions. For this purpose two processes are available. We may&nbsp;convert the salt into the oxalate from which the oxide is obtained&nbsp;by heating. A weighed quantity of the oxide is now taken and&nbsp;converted into sulphate by evaporating with dilute sulphuric acid.&nbsp;The sulphate is gently dried until the weight is constant, and from&nbsp;this weight the equivalent of the earth can be calculated. When&nbsp;repeated fractionation is attended by no change in the equivalent&nbsp;we may conclude that only one element is present. This process,&nbsp;however, is only rough, for the elements with which we are dealing&nbsp;have very close equivalents.
