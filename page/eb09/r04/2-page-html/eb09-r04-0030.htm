        <p><span class="font1">lord of the town. @@<sup>1</sup> In 903 Oleg chose a wife for Igor,
                named Olga, @@<sup>2</sup> said to have been a native of Pskoff, the origin&nbsp;of
                which place, now mentioned for the first time, is unknown.&nbsp;We are told that it
                was a city of importance before the&nbsp;arrival of Rurik. The derivation of the
                name is disputed,&nbsp;some deriving it from a Finnish, others from a Slavonic
                root.&nbsp;Oleg next resolved to make an attack upon Byzantium,&nbsp;and his
                preparations were great both by sea and land.&nbsp;Leo the Philosopher, then
                emperor, was ill able to resist&nbsp;these barbarians. He attempted to block the
                passage of&nbsp;the Bosphorus, but Oleg dragged his ships across the land&nbsp;and
                arrived before the gates of Constantinople. The&nbsp;Greeks begged for peace and
                offered tribute. Oleg is said&nbsp;to have hung his shield in derision on the gates
                of the&nbsp;city. We may believe this without going so far as to give&nbsp;credence
                to Stryikowski, the Polish writer, who says it was&nbsp;to be seen there in his time
                (16th century). The atrocities&nbsp;committed by Oleg and his followers are
                described by&nbsp;Karamzin, the Russian historian ; they are just such as&nbsp;the
                other Norsemen of their race were committing at&nbsp;the same time in northern and
                western Europe. The&nbsp;Byzantines paid a large sum of money that their
                city&nbsp;might be exempted from injury, and soon after Oleg sent&nbsp;ambassadors
                    @@<sup>3</sup> to the emperor to arrange the terms. The&nbsp;treaty was ratified
                by oaths : the Byzantines swore by the&nbsp;Gospels, and the Russians by their gods
                Perun and Volos.&nbsp;In 911 Oleg made another treaty with the Byzantines,
                the&nbsp;terms of which, as of the preceding one, are preserved in&nbsp;Nestor. The
                authenticity of these two treaties has been&nbsp;called in question by some writers,
                but Miklosich truly&nbsp;observes that it would have been impossible at the
                time&nbsp;Nestor wrote to forge the Scandinavian names. Soon&nbsp;after this Oleg
                died ; he had exercised supreme power till&nbsp;the time of his death to the
                exclusion of Igor, and seems&nbsp;to have been regarded by the people as a wizard.
                He is&nbsp;said to have been killed by the bite of a serpent, which had&nbsp;coiled
                itself in the skull of his horse, as he was gazing at&nbsp;the animal’s unburied
                bones. The story is in reality a&nbsp;Scandinavian saga, as has been shown by
                Bielowski and&nbsp;Rafn. It is also found in other countries. In the reign&nbsp;of
                Igor the Petchenegs first make their appearance in&nbsp;Russian history. In 941 he
                undertook an expedition&nbsp;against Constantinople and entered the Bosphorus
                after&nbsp;devastating the provinces of Pontus, Paphlagonia, and&nbsp;Bithynia.
                Nestor has not concealed the atrocities committed by the Russians on this occasion ;
                he tells us of the&nbsp;churches and monasteries which they burned, and of
                their&nbsp;cruelty to the captives. They were, however, attacked by&nbsp;the
                Byzantine fleet, and overpowered by the aid of Greek&nbsp;fire ; many were drowned,
                and many of those who swam to&nbsp;land were slaughtered by the infuriated peasants;
                only&nbsp;one of their number escaped. Thirsting to avenge his&nbsp;loss, Igor
                fitted out another expedition in the spring of&nbsp;the following year. The Greeks
                were unwilling to run&nbsp;a risk again ; they renewed the treaty which had
                been&nbsp;signed with Oleg, and were only too glad to purchase&nbsp;deliverance from
                their adversaries. The Russian at first&nbsp;demanded too much, but was finally
                persuaded by his more&nbsp;prudent attendants: “If Cæsar speaks thus,” said
                they,&nbsp;“ what more do we want than to have gold and silver&nbsp;and silks
                without fighting? Who knows which will&nbsp;survive, we or they? Who has ever been
                able to conclude&nbsp;a treaty with the sea ? We do not go on the dry land,&nbsp;but
                on the waves of the sea ; death is common to all.”</span></p><div>
            <p><span class="font1">A treaty of peace was accordingly concluded, which is given at
                    full length by Nestor ; of the fifty names attached&nbsp;to it we find three
                    were Slavonic and the rest Norse. The&nbsp;two races are beginning to be fused.
                    From this expedition Igor returned triumphant. He was, however, unfortunate in a
                    subsequent attack on the Drevlians, a Slavonic&nbsp;tribe whose territory is now
                    partly occupied by the&nbsp;government of Tchernigoff. The Drevlians had
                    long&nbsp;suffered from his exactions. They resolved to encounter&nbsp;him under
                    the command of their prince Male ; for they&nbsp;saw, as a chronicler says, that
                    it was necessary to kill the&nbsp;wolf, or the whole flock would become his
                    prey. They&nbsp;accordingly laid an ambuscade near their town Korosten,&nbsp;now
                    called Iskorost, in the government of Volhynia, and&nbsp;slew him and all his
                    company. According to Leo the&nbsp;Deacon, he was tied to two trees bent
                    together, and when&nbsp;they were let go the unhappy chief was torn to
                    pieces.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">Igor was succeeded by his son Sviatoslaff, the first Russian
                    prince with a Slavonic name. Olga, however,&nbsp;the spirited wife of Igor, was
                    now regent, owing to her&nbsp;son’s minority. Fearful was the punishment she
                    inflicted&nbsp;upon the Drevlians for the death of her husband, and
                    the&nbsp;story lacks no dramatic interest as it has been handed&nbsp;down by the
                    old chronicler. Some of the Drevlians were&nbsp;buried alive in pits which she
                    had caused to be dug for&nbsp;the purpose previously; some were burned alive;
                    and others&nbsp;murdered at a </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">trizna,</span><span class="font1"> or funeral feast,
                    which she had&nbsp;appointed to be held in her husband’s honour. The
                    town&nbsp;Iskorost was afterwards set on fire by tying lighted&nbsp;matches to
                    the tails of sparrows and pigeons, and letting&nbsp;them fly on the roofs of the
                    houses. Here we certainly&nbsp;have a piece of a </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">Udina,</span><span class="font1"> as the old Russian
                    legendary&nbsp;poems are called. Geoffrey of Monmouth and Layamon give&nbsp;the
                    same account of the capture of the city of Cirencester&nbsp;by Gurmund at the
                    head of the Saxons, and something&nbsp;similar is also told about Harold
                    Hardrada in Sicily.&nbsp;Finally, at the close of her life, Olga became a
                    Christian.&nbsp;She herself visited the capital of the Greek empire,
                    and&nbsp;was instructed in the mysteries of her new faith by the&nbsp;patriarch.
                    There she was baptized by him in 955, and the&nbsp;emperor Constantine
                    Porphyrogenitus became her godfather. She did not, however, succeed in
                    persuading her&nbsp;son Sviatoslaff to embrace the same faith, although
                    he&nbsp;took no measures to impede its progress among his subjects. This son was
                    as celebrated a warrior as Oleg ; his&nbsp;victories were chiefly over the
                    Petchenegs previously mentioned, a people of Mongol origin inhabiting the basin
                    of&nbsp;the Don. He began, however, the fatal custom of breaking up Russia into
                    apanages, which he distributed among&nbsp;his sons. The effects of this
                    injudicious policy, subsequently pursued by other grand princes, were soon
                    felt.&nbsp;Thus was paved the way for the invasion of Russia by
                    the&nbsp;Mongols, who held it for two hundred years, and communicated that
                    semi-Asiatic character to the dress and&nbsp;customs of the country which the
                    </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ukazes</span><span
                    class="font1"> of Peter the&nbsp;Great could hardly eradicate, and which perhaps
                    have&nbsp;not entirely disappeared even in our own times. In his&nbsp;division
                    of the country, Sviatoslaff gave Kieff to his son&nbsp;Yaropolk ; to another
                    son, Oleg, the conquered land of the&nbsp;Drevlians ; to another, Vladimir, he
                    assigned Novgorod.&nbsp;It would be impossible to interest the reader in the
                    petty&nbsp;wars of these princes. After having gained several&nbsp;victories
                    over the Petchenegs, Sviatoslaff set out on an&nbsp;expedition against the
                    Bulgarians, a Ugro-Finnish tribe,&nbsp;dwelling on the banks of the Volga, the
                    remains of whose&nbsp;ancient capital can still be seen. He made himself
                    master&nbsp;of their country, but his victorious career was cut short
                    at&nbsp;the cataracts of the Dnieper, where he and his soldiers&nbsp;were slain
                    by the Petchenegs. According to the barbarous&nbsp;custom of the times, their
                    prince Kurya made his skull</span></p>
