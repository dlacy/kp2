                largely the food of the poor.” According to the words&nbsp;just quoted from the
                Apocalypse, there was to be a dearth of&nbsp;grain and a superfluity of wine; the
                price of the wheat was to&nbsp;be seven times the ordinary, according to
                    Reinach<sup>5</sup>S computation, and that of the barley four times. This
                strange&nbsp;statement suggested some historical allusion, and the discovery&nbsp;of
                the allusion was made by Reinach, who points out that&nbsp;Domitian by an edict in

                ordered the reduction of those in the&nbsp;provinces by one-half. As Asia Minor
                suffered specially under&nbsp;this edict, an agitation was set on foot which
                resulted in thc&nbsp;revocation of the edict. In this revocation the
                Apocalyptist&nbsp;saw the menace of a famine of the necessaries of life,
                while&nbsp;the luxuries would remain unaffected. From his ascetic standpoint the
                revocation of the edict could only pander to drunkenness and immorality.

        <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Author.—</span><span class="font2">Before
                entering on the Chief data which help towards the determination of this question, we
                shall first state the author’s&nbsp;standpoint. His book exhibits a Christianity
                that is—as&nbsp;Harnack </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ency.
                BritJ,</span><span class="font2"> xx. 498) writes—&quot; free from the
                law,&nbsp;free from national prejudices, universal and yet a Christianity&nbsp;which
                is independent of Paul. . . . The author speaks not at&nbsp;all of the
                    law@@<sup>1</sup>—the word does not occur in his work; he looks&nbsp;for
                salvation from the power and grace of God and Christ alone&nbsp;. . . nowhere has he
                made a distinction between Gentile and&nbsp;Jewish Christians. . . . The author of
                the Apocalypse has cast&nbsp;aside all national religious prejudices.” The writer-is
                not&nbsp;dependent, consciously or unconsciously, on the Pauline teaching.&nbsp;He
                has won his way to Universalism, not through the Pauline&nbsp;method, but through
                one of his own. He has no serious preference for the people of Israel as such, but
                only for the martyrs&nbsp;and confessors, who shall belong to every tribe and tongue
                and&nbsp;people and nation (vii. 9 seq.). The unbelieving Jews are &quot;
                a&nbsp;synagogue of Satan ” (ii. 9).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Yet, on the other hand, our author’s attitude to the world reflects
                the temper of Judaism rather than that of Christianity.&nbsp;He looks upon the
                enemies of the Christian Church with unconcealed hatred. No prayer arises within his
                work on their&nbsp;behalf, and nothing but unalloyed triumph is displayed&nbsp;over
                their doom. The Christian duty of love to those that&nbsp;wrong us does not seem to
                have impressed itself on our&nbsp;Apocalyptist.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Is the Apocalypse
                pseudonymous?—</span><span class="font2">All the Jewish apocalypses are

                class="font2"> Since our book undoubtedly belongs&nbsp;to this category, the
                question of its pseudonymity must arise.&nbsp;In the articles on Apocalyptic
                Literature and Apocryphal&nbsp;Literature </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">(qq.v.)</span><span class="font2"> we have shown the
                large lines of differentiation between apocalyptic and prophecy. The chief ground
                for&nbsp;resorting to pseudonymous authorship in Judaism was that the&nbsp;belief in
                prophecy was lost among the people. Hence any writer&nbsp;who would appeal to them
                was obliged to do so in the name of&nbsp;some great figure of the past. Furthermore,
                this belief that&nbsp;prophecy had ceased led the religious personalities of the
                later&nbsp;time to authenticate their message by means of antedated&nbsp;prophecy.
                They procured confidence in their actual predictions&nbsp;by appealing to the
                literal fulfilment of such antedated prophecy.&nbsp;In such literature we find the
                characteristic words or their&nbsp;equivalents; &quot; Seal up the prophecy: it is
                not for this generation,” which are designed to explain the late appearance of
                the&nbsp;works in which they are found, But this universal characteristic of
                apocalyptic is almost wholly lacking in the New Testament Apocalypse. The
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Vaticinium ex
                eventu</span><span class="font2"> plays but a very</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">small part in it. Moreover, the chief ground for the development of a
                pseudonymous literature was absent in the early Christian church. For with the
                advent of Christianity prophecy&nbsp;had sprung anew into life, and our author
                distinctly declares that *&nbsp;the words of thc book are for his own generation
                (xxii. 10).&nbsp;Hence we conclude that thc grounds are lacking which
                would&nbsp;entitle our assuming a priori that tbe Apocalypse is
            pseudonymous.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">W as the Author the Son of Zebedee, the
                Apostle?—</span><span class="font2">The evidence of the book is against this
                assumption. The writer demands&nbsp;a hearing as a prophet (xxii. 6), and in no
                single passage makes&nbsp;any claim to having been an apostle. Nay more, the
                evidence&nbsp;of the text, so far as it goes, is against such a view. He
                never&nbsp;refers to any previous intercourse with Christ such as we
                find&nbsp;frequently in the Fourth Gospel, and when he speaks of &quot;
                the&nbsp;twelve apostles of the Lamb ” (xxi. 14) he does so in a tone
                that&nbsp;would seem to exclude him from that body. Here internal and&nbsp;external
                evidence are at strife; for from the time of Justin&nbsp;pnwards the Apocalypse was
                received by the church as the work&nbsp;of the Apostle John (see Swete, </span><span
                class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">op. citJ,</span><span class="font2"> p.
                clxxv). If the writer&nbsp;of the Fourth Gospel was the Apostle John, then thc
                difficulties&nbsp;for the assumption of an apostolic authorship of the Apocalypse
                become well-nigh insuperable. Nay more, the difficulties&nbsp;attending on the
                assumption of a common authorship of the&nbsp;Gospel and Apocalypse, independently
                of tbe question of thc&nbsp;apostolic authorship of the Gospel, are practically
                insuperable.&nbsp;Some decades ago these difficulties were not
                insurmountable,&nbsp;when critics assigned a Neronic date to the Apocalypse and
                a&nbsp;Domitianic or later date to the Gospel. It was from such a&nbsp;standpoint
                conceivable that the thoughts and diction of thc&nbsp;writer had undergone an entire
                transformation in the long&nbsp;interval that intervened between the composition of
                tbe two&nbsp;books, on the supposition that both were from the same hand.&nbsp;But
                now that both books are assigned to the last decade of the&nbsp;ist century a.d. by
                a growing body of critics, the hypothesis of&nbsp;a common authorship can hardly be
                sustained. The validity of&nbsp;such an hypothesis was attacked as early as the 4th
                century by&nbsp;Dionysius of Alexandria in the fragment of his treatise
                rept&nbsp;€7ταγγ€λώρ, in Eusebius, </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">H.E.</span><span class="font2"> vii. 24 seq. His
                arguments, as&nbsp;summed up by Swete </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-style:italic;">(op. cit.,</span><span class="font2"> p. cxiv seq.), arc
                as follows:</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">&quot; John the Evangelist abstains from mentioning his own name, but
                John the Apocalyptist names himself more than once at&nbsp;the very outset of his
                book, and again near its end. Doubtless&nbsp;there were many who bore the name of
                John in the early Christian&nbsp;communities; we read, for instance, of 'John, whose
                surname&nbsp;was Mark,’ and there may have been a second John in Asia, since&nbsp;at
                Ephesus, we are told, there were two tombs said to be John’s.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">. . . Again, while the Gospel and the Epistle of John show marks of
                agreement which suggest a common authorship, the Apocalypse&nbsp;differs widely from
                both in its ideas and in its way of expressing&nbsp;them; we miss in it the frequent
                references to ' life,’ ' light,’</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2"><sup>4</sup> truth,’<sup>4</sup> grace ’ and 'love ’ which arc
                characteristic of thc Apostle and find ourselves in a totally different region of
                thought. . . .&nbsp;Lastly, the linguistic eccentricities of the Apocalypse bar
                the&nbsp;way against the acceptance of the book as the work of the&nbsp;Evangelist.
                The Gospel and the First Epistle are written in&nbsp;correct and flowing Greek, and
                there is not a barbarism, a solecism,&nbsp;or a provincialism in them; whereas thc
                Greek of thc Apocalypse&nbsp;is inaccurate, disfigured by unusual or foreign words
                and even&nbsp;at times by solecisms.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">AU subsequent criticism has more or less confirmed the conclusions of
                Dionysius. On the other hand, it is impossible to ignore thc signs of a relationship
                between the Apocalypse and&nbsp;the Gospel in the minor peculiarities of
                    language.@@<sup>2</sup> These,&nbsp;Swete holds, &quot; create a strong
                presumption of affinity ” between&nbsp;the two books, while Boussct infers that
                they&quot; justify the assumption that thc entire circle of Johannine writings
                spring from&nbsp;circles which stood under the influence of the John of
                Asia&nbsp;Minor.”</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">We conclude, therefore, that the Gospel and thc Apocalypse</span></p>
