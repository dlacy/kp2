<p><span class="font0">had taken refuge in the castle of the Visconti of Campag-natico. Frederick without delay caused one of the Visconti to be seized and kept prisoner until Arnold was&nbsp;given up, and then consigned the latter to the papal legates.&nbsp;The pope in his turn gave the reformer into the hands of&nbsp;the prefect, Pietro di Vico, who immediately hanged his&nbsp;prisoner, burnt his body at the stake, and cast his ashes&nbsp;into the Tiber. Theexecutiontookplacein June 1155.&nbsp;The exact date and place of it are unknown ; we only&nbsp;know that Arnold met his fate with great serenity and&nbsp;firmness.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the Romans who had so basely deserted their champion λvould not give up their republic. Their&nbsp;envoys went to meet Frederick near Sutri, and made an&nbsp;address in the usual fantastic style on the privileges of&nbsp;the Roman people and its sole right to confer the imperial&nbsp;crown. But Frederick indignantly cut short their harangue,&nbsp;and they had to depart full of rage. He then continued&nbsp;his march, and, entering Romeon the 18th June 1155, was&nbsp;forthwith crowned in St Peter’s by the pope. Thereupon&nbsp;the Romans rushed to arms, and made a furious attack on&nbsp;the Leonine city and the imperial camp. A desperate&nbsp;battle went on throughout the day ; and the knights&nbsp;proved that the equestrian order instituted at Arnold’s&nbsp;suggestion was no empty sham. About a thousand&nbsp;Romans perished by the sword or by drowning, but their&nbsp;fellow-citizens made such determined preparations to&nbsp;continue the struggle that Frederick, on the 19th June,&nbsp;hastily retreated or rather fled, and was escorted as far&nbsp;as Tivoli by the pope and the cardinals. After all, the&nbsp;temporal power of the papacy was not restored, and the&nbsp;republic still survived in the form bestowed on it by&nbsp;Arnold of Brescia. Its existence was in truth favourable&nbsp;rather than injurious to Frederick, whose aim was to rule&nbsp;over Rome and treat the bishops as his vassals. He had&nbsp;not yet discerned that his best policy would have been&nbsp;to use the republic as a lever against the pope. The&nbsp;latter, with keener acumen, while remaining faithful to the&nbsp;feudal party in Rome, made alliance with the communes&nbsp;of Lombardy and encouraged them in their resistance to&nbsp;the emperor. Hadrian IV. died in 1159, and the national&nbsp;party elected Alexander III. (1159-1181), who energetically opposed the pretensions of Frederick, but, having to&nbsp;struggle with three antipopes successively raised against&nbsp;him by the imperial party, was repeatedly driven into&nbsp;exile. During these schisms the senate quietly carried on&nbsp;the government, administered justice, and made war on&nbsp;some neighbouring cities and barons. An army comprising many nobles of the national party marched against&nbsp;Tusculum, but found it defended by several valiant&nbsp;officers and a strong band of German soldiery, who, on the&nbsp;29th May 1167, inflicted on the Romans so severe a defeat&nbsp;that it is styled by Gregorovius the Cannæ of the Middle&nbsp;Ages. Shortly afterwards the emperor arrived in Rome&nbsp;with his antipope Paschal III., and Alexander had to fly&nbsp;before him to Benevento. Then, at last, Frederick came&nbsp;to terms with the republic, recognized the senate, which&nbsp;accepted investiture at his hands, re-established the prefecture as an imperial office, and bestowed it on Giovanni,&nbsp;son of Pietro di Vico. He then hastily departed, without having advanced outside the Leonine city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile Pope Alexander continued the crafty policy of Hadrian and with better success, for the Lombard cities&nbsp;had now formed a league and inflicted a signal defeat on&nbsp;the emperor at Legnano on the 29th May 1176. One of&nbsp;the results of this battle was the conclusion of an agreement between the pope and the emperor, the latter&nbsp;resigning his pretensions on Rome and yielding all that&nbsp;he had denied to Hadrian. And by the treaty of Venice&nbsp;(1st August 1177) the antipope was forsaken, Alexander</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">III. recognized and hailed as tho legitimate pontiff, and&nbsp;the prefect of Rome again nominated by the pope, to&nbsp;whom the emperor restored the temporal power, acknowledging him the independent sovereign of Rome and of&nbsp;the ecclesiastical state, from Acquapendente to Ceprano.&nbsp;Frederick’s troops accompanied the pope to Rome, where&nbsp;the republic was forced to make submission to him. But,&nbsp;proudly conscious as it still was of its strength, its&nbsp;surrender wore the aspect of a voluntary concession, and&nbsp;its terms began with these words—“ Totius populi Romani&nbsp;consilio et deliberatione statutum est,” &lt;Vc. The senators,&nbsp;elected yearly in September, had to swear fealty to the&nbsp;pope, and a certain proportion of nobles was included in&nbsp;their number. On his return to Rome, Alexander received&nbsp;a solemn welcome from all, but he had neither extinguished&nbsp;nor really subdued the republic. On the contrary, men’s&nbsp;minds were more and more inflamed by the example of&nbsp;freedom displayed in the north of Italy. He died on the&nbsp;30th August 1181. The fact that between 1181 and&nbsp;1187 there were three popes always living in exile proves&nbsp;that the republic was by no means crushed. During the&nbsp;same period another blow was inflicted on the papacy by&nbsp;the marriage of Henry VI., soil and successor to Frederick&nbsp;L, with Constance, sole heiress of the Norman line in&nbsp;Naples. For thus the kingdom was joined to the empire&nbsp;and the popes were more than ever in the latter’s power.&nbsp;On the 20th December 1187 Clement III. (1187-91), being&nbsp;raised to the pontificate, made a solemn agreement with&nbsp;the Government of the Capitol before coming to Rome.&nbsp;And this peace or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Concordia</span><span class="font0"> had the air of a treaty&nbsp;between potentates of equal importance. Rome confronted the pope from the same standpoint from which&nbsp;the Lombard cities had confronted the emperor after&nbsp;Legnano. This treaty, the basis of the new constitution,&nbsp;was confirmed on the last day of May 1188 (Anno&nbsp;XLIV. of the senate). It begins with these words :&nbsp;—“ Concordia inter Dominum Papam Clementem III. et&nbsp;senatores populumque Romanum super regalibus et aliis&nbsp;dignitatibus urbis. ” The pope was recognized as supreme&nbsp;lord, and invested the senators with their dignity. He&nbsp;resumed the privilege of coinage, but allowed one-third of&nbsp;the issue to be made by the senate. Almost all the old&nbsp;pontifical rights and prerogatives .were restored to him.&nbsp;The pope might employ the Roman militia for the defence&nbsp;of his patrimony, but was to furnish its pay. The rights&nbsp;of the church over Tivoli and Tusculum were confirmed ;&nbsp;but the republic reserved to itself the right of making war&nbsp;on those cities, and declared its resolve to dismantle and&nbsp;destroy the walls and castle of Tusculum. In this undertaking the pope was to co-operate with the Romans, even&nbsp;should the unhappy city make surrender to him alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From all this it is clear that the church had been made independent of the empire, and that the republic, despite&nbsp;its numerous concessions, was by no means subject to the&nbsp;church. The pope, in fact, had obtained liberty of&nbsp;election, and Frederick L, by resigning the investiture of&nbsp;the prefect, had virtually renounced his claim to imperial&nbsp;power in Rome. The republic had no patrician nor any&nbsp;other imperial magistrate, and preserved its independence&nbsp;even as regarded the pope, who merely granted investiture&nbsp;to magistrates freely chosen by the people, and had no&nbsp;legislative nor administrative power in the city. His&nbsp;temporal dominion was limited to his great possessions, to&nbsp;his regalia, to a supreme authority that was very indefinite,&nbsp;and to a feudal authority over the barons of the Campagna&nbsp;and many cities of a state that seemed ever on the point&nbsp;of dissolution. The senate continued to frame laws, to&nbsp;govern, and to administer justice. The army carried on&nbsp;the wars of the republic, as we see by the tragic fate of&nbsp;Tusculum, which was razed to the ground on the 19th</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
