This was a ſeverity that might take the name of cruelty ; but the vices of the age, in ſome meaſure, required it. In theſe puniſhments inflicted on the guilty, the Chriſtians, who had all along been growing more numerous, were ſharers. Againſt theſe he drew up ſeveral letters and edicts, which ſhowed that he intended a very ſevere perſecution ; but if we may believe the credulous hiſtorians of the times, he was diverted juſt as he was going tv&gt; ſign them by a thunderbolt, which fell ſo near his perſon, that all the people judged him to be deſtroyed.</p><p>But, however Heaven might have interpoſed on this occaſion, ſt is certain that his ſeverities at laſt were the cauſe of his deſtruction. Meneſthus, his principal ſecretary, having been threatened by him for ſome fault which he had committed, began to c<hi rend="sup">1</hi>θnfider how he might prevent the meditated blow. For this purpoſe, he forged a roll of the names of ſeveral perſons, whom he pretended the emperor had marked out for death, adding his own to ſtrengthen him in the conſidence of the party. The ſcroll thus contrived was ſhown with an air of the utmoſt ſecrecy to ſome of the perſons concerned ; and they, to procure their ſafety, immediately agreed with him to deſtroy the emperor. This reſolution was ſoon put in execution ; for, as the emperor paſſed with a ſmall guard from Uraclea, in Thrace, towards Byzantium, the conſpirators ſet upon him at once, and flew him with very ſmall reſiſtance. He was ſlain in the 6oth, or, as ſome ſay, in the 6 id year of his age, after a very active reign of almoſt five years.</p><p>The number of pretenders to the throne, which had formerly inſeſted the empire, were, by the laſt monarch’s activity, ſo entirely removed, that there now ſeemed to be none that would venture to declare himſelf a candidate. The army referred the choice to the ſenate ; and, on the other ſide, the ſenate declined it ; ſo that a ſpace of near eight months elapſed in theſe negociations. At length, however, the ſenate made choice of Tacitus, a man of great merit, and noway ambitious of the honours that were offered him. Upon being ſolicited to accept the empire, he at firſt refuſed, and retired to his country-houſe in Campania, to avoid their importunities ; but being at length prevailed upon, he accepted the reins of government, being at that time yy years old.</p><p>One of the firſt acts of his government was the puniſhment of thoſe who had conſpired againſt the late emperor. Meneſthus was impaled alive, his body being thrown to be devoured by wild beaſts ; his eſtate alſo was conſiſcated to the exchequer ; and his ready money, which was very conſiderable, applied towards paying the army. During this ſhort reign, the ſenate ſeemed to have a large ſhare of authority, and the hiſtorians of the times are liberal of their praiſes to ſuch emperors as were thus willing to divide their power.— Upon endeavouring to obtain the conſulſhip for his brother Probus, he was refuſed it by the ſenate ; at which he ſeemed no way moved, but calmly remarked that the ſenate beſt knew whom to chooſe. This moderation prevailed in all the reſt of his conduct ; hc was extremely temperate ; his table was plain, and furniſhed with nothing expenſive ; he even prohibited his empreſs from wearing jewels, and forbad the uſe of gold and embroidery. He was Fond of learning, and the •memory of ſuch men as had deſerved well of theif country. He particularly eſteemed the works of his nameſake Tacitus the hiſtorian ; commanding that they ſhould be placed in every public library throughout the empire, and that many copies of them ſhould be tran-ſcribed at the public charge. A reign begun with ſuch moderation and juſtice, only wanted continuance to have made the empire happy ; but after enjoying the empire about ſix months, hc died of a fever in his march to oppoſe the Perſians and Scythians, who had invaded the eaſtern parts of the empire.</p><p>Upon the death of Tacitus the army ſeemed divided in the choice of an emperor ; one part of it choſe Flo-rianus, brother to the deceaſed ; but the majority were for ſome time undetermined. They alleged amongſt each other the neceſſity of chooſing one eminent for valour, honour, piety, clemency, and probity ; but the laſt virtue being that chiefly inſiſted upon, the whole army, as if by common conſent, cried out that Probus ſhould be emperor. He was accordingly confirmed in this dignity with the uſual ſolemnities : and Florianus finding himſelſ deſerted, even by thoſe legions who had promiſed to ſtand up in his ſupport, opened his arteries and bled himſelf to death.</p><p>Probus was 44 years old when he aſcended the throne, being born of noble parentage at Sirmium in Pannonia, and bred up a ſoldier ſrom his youth. He began early to diſtinguiſh himſelf for his diſcipline and valour ; being ſrequently the firſt man who in beſieging towns ſealed the walls, or that burſt into the enemy’s camp. He was no leſs remarkable for ſingle combats, and ſaving the lives of many eminent citizens. Nor was his activity and courage, when elected to the empire, leſs apparent, than in his private ſtation. He firſt repreſſed the Germans in Gaul, of whom he flew 400,000. He then marched into Dalmatia, to oppoſe and ſubdue the Sarmatians. From thence he led his forces into Thrace, and forced the Goths to ſuc for peace. He after that turned his arms towards Aſia ; ſubdued the province of Iſauria ; and marching onward, conquered a people called the <hi rend="italic">Blemyes ;</hi>  who, leaving their native ſoreſts of Ethiopia, had poſſeſſed themſelves of Arabia and Judea, and had continued in a ſtate of rebellion ſince the reign of Gallienus. Nar-ſis alſo, the king of Perſia, ſubmitted at his approach : and upon his return into Europe, he divided the depopulated parts of Thrace among its barbarous invaders : a circumſtance that afterwards produced great calamities to the empire.</p><p>His diligence was not leſs conſpicuous in ſuppreffing inteſtine commotions. Saturninus, being compelled by the Egyptians to declare himſelf emperor, was defeated and ſlain. Proculus alſo (a perſon remarkable only for his great attachment to women, and who boaſted in a letter, that, having taken 100 Sarmatian virgins priſoners, he deprived ten of that name in one night, and all the reſt within a fortnight) ſet up againſt the emperor ; but was compelled to fly, and at length delivered up by the Germans. At the ſame time Conoſus (who was a remarkable votary to Bacchus, being able to drink as much wine as ten could do, without being difordered<hi rend="sub">4</hi>) rebelled, and being overcome hanged himſelf in deſpair. Probus, when he ſaw him immediately after his death, could not avoid pointing to him, and ſaying, <hi rend="sup">w</hi> There hangs not a man but a caſk.” Still, however, not-withſtauding every effort to give quiet to the empire,</p></body></text></TEI>
