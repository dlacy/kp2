<p><span class="font2">out that great national undertaking with which his name will always be honourably connected, and of which there&nbsp;is reason to believe that Lords Somers and Halifax were&nbsp;the original promoters. The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Codex Juris Gentium Diplo-maticus</span><span class="font2"> of Leibnitz was taken by the editor as the model&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera.</span><span class="font2"> The plan was to publish all records of&nbsp;alliances and other transactions in which England was&nbsp;concerned with foreign powers from 1101 to the time of&nbsp;publication, limiting the collection to original documents&nbsp;in the royal archives and the great national libraries.&nbsp;Unfortunately, this was not uniformly carried out, and&nbsp;the work contains some extracts from printed chronicles.&nbsp;From 1694 he corresponded with Leibnitz, by whom he&nbsp;was greatly influenced with respect to the plan and formation of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera.</span><span class="font2"> While collecting materials, Rymer&nbsp;unwisely engraved a spurious charter of King Malcolm,&nbsp;acknowledging that Scotland was held in homage from&nbsp;Edward the Confessor. When this came to be known,&nbsp;the Scottish antiquaries were extremely indignant. G.&nbsp;Redpath published a MS. on the independence of the&nbsp;Scottish crown, by Sir T. Craig, entitled </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scotland's Sovereignty Asserted</span><span class="font2"> (1695), and the subject was referred to by&nbsp;Bishop Nicolson in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Scottish Historical Library</span><span class="font2"> (1702).&nbsp;This led Rymer to address three </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Letters to the Bishop of&nbsp;Carlisle</span><span class="font2"> (1702), explaining his action, and discussing other&nbsp;antiquarian matters. The first and second letters are&nbsp;usually found together ; the third is extremely rare. Rymer&nbsp;had now been for some years working with great industry,&nbsp;but was constantly obliged to petition the crown for money&nbsp;to carry on the undertaking. Up to August 1698 he&nbsp;had expended £1253, and had only received £500 on&nbsp;account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">At last, on November 20, 1704, was issued the first folio volume of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eoedera, Conventiones, Litteræ et cujuscuη-que generis Acta Publixa inter reges Angliæ et alios quosvis&nbsp;imperatores, reges, &amp;c., ab A.D. 1101 ad nostra usque&nbsp;tempora habita aut tractata.</span><span class="font2"> The publication proceeded&nbsp;with great rapidity, and fifteen volumes were brought out&nbsp;by Rymer in nine years. Two hundred and fifty copies&nbsp;were printed ; but, as nearly all of them were presented to&nbsp;persons of distinction, the work soon became so scarce&nbsp;that it was priced by booksellers at one hundred guineas.&nbsp;A hundred and twenty sheets of the fifteenth volume and&nbsp;the copy for the remainder were burnt at a fire at William&nbsp;Bowyer’s, the printer, on January 30, 1712-13. Rymer&nbsp;died shortly after the appearance of this volume, but he&nbsp;had prepared materials for carrying the work down to the&nbsp;end of the reign of James I. These were placed in the&nbsp;hands of Robert Sanderson, his assistant. For the greater&nbsp;part of his life Rymer derived his chief subsistence from&nbsp;a mortgage assigned to him by his father. His miscellaneous literary work could not have been very profitable.&nbsp;At one time he was reduced to offer his MSS. for a new&nbsp;edition for sale to the earl of Oxford. About 1703 his&nbsp;affairs became more settled, and he afterwards regularly&nbsp;received his salary as historiographer, besides an additional £200 a year as editor of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera.</span><span class="font2"> Twenty-five copies of each volume were also allotted to him. He&nbsp;died at Arundel Street, Strand, December 14, 1713, and&nbsp;was buried in the church of St Clement Danes. His will&nbsp;was dated July 10, 1713. Tonson issued an edition of&nbsp;Rochester’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Works</span><span class="font2"> (1714), with a short preface by the&nbsp;late historiographer. Another posthumous publication&nbsp;was in a miscellaneous collection called </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cumous Amusements,</span><span class="font2"> by Al. B. (1714), which included “some translations from Greek, Latin, and Italian poets, by T.&nbsp;Rymer.” Some of his poetical pieces were also inserted&nbsp;in J. Nichols’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Select Collection</span><span class="font2"> (1780-86, 8 vols.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Two more volumes of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera</span><span class="font1"> were issued by Sanderson in 1715 and 1717, and the last three volumes (xviii., xix., and xx.) by&nbsp;the same editor, but upon a slightly different plan, in 1726-35.&nbsp;The latter volumes were published by Tonson, all the former by&nbsp;Churchill. Under Rymer it was carried down to 1586, and continued by Sanderson to 1654. The rarity and importance of the&nbsp;work induced Tonson to obtain a licence for a second edition, and&nbsp;George Holmes, deputy keeper of the Tower records, was appointed&nbsp;editor. The new edition appeared between 1727 and 1735. The&nbsp;last three volumes are the same in both issues. There are some&nbsp;corrections, enumerated in a volume, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Emendations in the new&nbsp;edition of Mr Rymer's Fœdera,</span><span class="font1"> printed by Tonson in 1730, but in&nbsp;other respects the second is inferior to the first edition. A third&nbsp;edition, embodying Holmes’s collation, was commenced at The Hague&nbsp;in 1737 and finished in 1745. It is in smaller type than the others,&nbsp;and is compressed within ten folio volumes. The arrangement is&nbsp;rather more convenient ; there is some additional matter ; the index&nbsp;is better ; and on the whole it is to be preferred to either of the&nbsp;previous editions. When the volumes of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera</span><span class="font1"> first appeared&nbsp;they were analysed by Leclerc and Rapin in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque&nbsp;Choisie</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque Ancienne et Moderne.</span><span class="font1"> Rapin’s articles&nbsp;were collected together, and appended, under the title of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abrégé&nbsp;historique des actes publiques de l' Angleterre,</span><span class="font1"> to the Hague edition.&nbsp;A translation, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Acta Regia,</span><span class="font1"> was published by Stephen&nbsp;Whatley, 1726-7, 4 vols. 8vo, reprinted both in 8vo and folio,&nbsp;the latter edition containing an analysis of the cancelled sheets,&nbsp;relating to the journals of the first Parliament of Charles I., of the&nbsp;18th volume of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In 1808 the Record Commissioners appointed Dr Adam Clarke to prepare a new and improved edition of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera.</span><span class="font1"> Six parts,&nbsp;large folio, edited by Clarke, Caley, and Holbrooke, were published between 1816 and 1830. Considerable additions were made,&nbsp;but the editing was performed in so unsatisfactory a manner that&nbsp;the publication was suspended in the middle of printing a seventh&nbsp;part. The latter portion, bringing the work down to 1383, was&nbsp;ultimately issued in 1869.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The wide learning and untiring labours of Rymer have received the warmest praise from historians. Sir T. D. Hardy styles the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera</span><span class="font1"> “ a work of which this nation has every reason to be proud,&nbsp;for with all its blemishes—and what work is faultless?—it has&nbsp;no rival in its class” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Syllabus,</span><span class="font1"> vol. ii., xxxvi.), and Mr J. B.&nbsp;Mullinger calls it “ a collection of the highest value and authority ”&nbsp;(Gardiner and Mullinger's </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Introduction to English History,</span><span class="font1"> p. 224).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best account of Rymer is to be found in the prefaces to Sir T. D. Hardy's </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Syllabus,</span><span class="font0"> 1869-86, 3 vols. 8vo. There is an unpublished life by Des Maizeaux&nbsp;(Brit. Mus. Add. MS. No. 4223), and a few memoranda in Bishop Rennet's&nbsp;collections (Lansd. MS. No. 987). In Caulfield’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Portraits,</span><span class="font0"> &lt;fec., 1819, i. 50, may&nbsp;be seen an engraving of Rymer, with a description of a satirical print. Rymer's&nbsp;two critical works on the drama are discussed by Sir T. N. Talfourd in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Retrospective Review,</span><span class="font0"> 1820, vol. 1. p. 1-15.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Sir T. D. Hardy's </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Syllabus</span><span class="font0"> gives in English a condensed notice of each instrument in the several editions of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Foedera,</span><span class="font0"> arranged in chronological order. The third volume contains a complete index of names and places, with a catalogue of&nbsp;the volumes of transcripts collected for the Record edition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera.</span><span class="font0"> In&nbsp;1869 the Record Office printed, for private distribution, Appendices A to E “ to a&nbsp;report on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera</span><span class="font0"> intended to have been submitted by C. Purton Cooper to the&nbsp;Late Commissioners of Public Records,” 3 vols. 8vo (including accounts of MSS.&nbsp;in foreign archives relating to Great Britain, with facsimiles). In the British&nbsp;Museum is preserved (Add. MS. 24,699) a folio volume of reports and papers&nbsp;relating to the Record edition. Rymer left extensive materials for a new edition&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera,</span><span class="font0"> bound in 59 vols, folio, and embracing the period from 1115 to&nbsp;1698. This was the collection offered to the earl of Oxford. It was purchased&nbsp;by the Treasury for £215 and is now in the British Museum (Add. MSS. Nos.&nbsp;4573 to 4630, and 18,911). A catalogue and index may be consulted in the 17th&nbsp;volume of Tonson's edition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fœdera.</span><span class="font0"> The Public Record Office possesses&nbsp;a MS. volume, compiled by Robert Lemon about 1800, containing instruments&nbsp;in the Patent Rolls omitted by Rymer.

<p><span class="font2">RZHEFF, Rsheff, Rjev, or Rzhoff, a town of European Russia at the head of a district in the Tver government,&nbsp;in 56° 16' N. lat. and 34° 21' E. long., 89 miles southwest of Tver, occupies the bluffs on both banks of the&nbsp;Volga (here 350 feet wide) near the confluence of the river&nbsp;Bazuza. It is the terminus of a branch line from the St&nbsp;Petersburg and Moscow Railway, has a population of&nbsp;18,569 (1880; 19,660 in 1866), carries on a variety of&nbsp;manufactures—hemp-spinning, malting, brewing, shipbuilding, &amp;c.—and is the centre of a great transit trade&nbsp;between the provinces of the lower Volga, Orel, Kaluga,&nbsp;and Smolensk, and the ports of St Petersburg and Riga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rzheff was already in existence in the 12th century, when it belonged to the principality of Smolensk and stood on the highway&nbsp;between Novgorod and Kieff. Under the rulers of Novgorod it&nbsp;become from 1225 a subordinate principality, and in the 15th&nbsp;century the two portions of the town were held by two independent&nbsp;princes, whose names are still preserved in the designations Knyaz&nbsp;Fedorovskii and Knyaz Dimitrievskii, given respectively to the&nbsp;left and the right bank of the Volga. In 1368 Rzheff was captured&nbsp;by Vladimir Andreevitch, and in 1375 it stood a three weeks’ seige&nbsp;and had its suburb burned by the same prince. It was made a&nbsp;district town in 1775.</span></p>
