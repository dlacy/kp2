<p><span class="font0">island with highest point 2100 ft. At the N. end of the lake a level swampy plain is traversed by various arms of the lake&nbsp;and by the Nianam river. This river has been shown to be&nbsp;identical with the Omo, the course of which was long one&nbsp;of the most debated questions of African geography. Its&nbsp;northernmost feeders rise on the high plateau S. of the Blue&nbsp;Nile, in 9<sup>0</sup> 10' N., and being swollen by other streams from&nbsp;the E. and W., soon form a large river. During its lower&nbsp;course it makes two considerable bends to the W. before finally&nbsp;entering the lake as a deep stream a quarter of a mile wide.&nbsp;Lake Rudolf (previously known on the east coast by report)&nbsp;was discovered in 1888 by Count Samuel Teleki and Lieutenant&nbsp;Ludwig von Hohnel. It was subsequently visited by Dr&nbsp;Donaldson Smith, Vittorio Bottego, II. S. H. Cavendish, H. H.&nbsp;Austin, and others, and by 1905 its shores and the neighbouring&nbsp;country had become fairly well known. In 1907, by an agreement between the powers concerned, the N.E. end of the lake,&nbsp;into which the Omo debouches, was assigned to Abyssinia,&nbsp;the rest of the lake to Great Britain.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUDOLPH I. (1218-1291), German king, son of Albert IV. count of Habsburg, and Hedwig, daughter of Ulrich count&nbsp;of Kyburg, was born at Limburg on the 1st of May 1218. At&nbsp;his father’s death in 1239 Rudolph inherited the family estates&nbsp;in Alsace, and in 1245 he married Gertrude, daughter of Burk-hard III. count of Hohenberg. He paid frequent visits to&nbsp;the court of his godfather the emperor Frederick II., and his&nbsp;loyalty to Frederick and to his son Conrad IV. was richly&nbsp;rewarded by grants of land, but in 1254 was excommunicated&nbsp;by Pope Innocent IV. The disorder in Germany after the&nbsp;fall of the Hohenstaufen afforded an opportunity for Rudolph&nbsp;to increase his possessions. His wife was an heiress; and&nbsp;on the death of his childless uncle, Hartmann VI. count of&nbsp;Kyburg, in 1264, he seized his valuable estates. Successful&nbsp;feuds with the bishops of Strassburg and Basel further augmented his wealth and his reputation; rights over various&nbsp;tracts of land w<sup>r</sup>ere purchased from abbots and others; and&nbsp;he was also the possessor of large estates in the regions now&nbsp;known as Switzerland and Alsace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These various sources of wealth and influence had rendered Rudolph the most powerful prince in S.W. Germany when,&nbsp;in the autumn of 1273, the princes met to elect a king. His&nbsp;election at Frankfort on the 29th of September 1273 was largely&nbsp;due to the efforts of his brother-in-law, Frederick III. of&nbsp;Hohenzollern, burgrave of Nuremberg. The support of Albert&nbsp;duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, and of Louis II. count palatine of&nbsp;the Rhine and duke of upper Bavaria, had been purchased&nbsp;by betrothing them to two of Rudolph’s daughters; so that&nbsp;Ottakar II. king of Bohemia, a candidate for the throne, was&nbsp;almost alone in his opposition. Rudolph was crowned at&nbsp;Aix-la-Chapelle on the 24th of October 1273, and the feast&nbsp;which followed has been described by Schiller in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dcr Graf von&nbsp;Hapsburg.</span><span class="font0"> To win the approbation of the pope Rudolph renounced all imperial rights in Rome, the papal territory and&nbsp;Sicily, and promised to lead a new crusade; and Pope&nbsp;Gregory X., in spite of Ottakar’s protests, not only recognized&nbsp;Rudolph himself, but persuaded Alphonso X. king of Castile,&nbsp;who had been chosen German king in 1257, to do the same.&nbsp;In November 1274 it was decided by the diet at Nuremberg&nbsp;that all crown estates seized since the death of the emperor&nbsp;Frederick II. must be restored, and that Ottakar of Bohemia&nbsp;must answer to the diet for not recognizing the new king.&nbsp;Ottakar refused to appear or to restore the provinces of Austria,&nbsp;Styria, Carinthia and Carniola which he had seized. He was&nbsp;placed under the ban; and in June 1276 war was declared&nbsp;against him. Having detached Henry I. duke of lower Bavaria&nbsp;from his side, Rudolph compelled the Bohemian king to cede&nbsp;the four provinces in November 1276. Ottakar was then&nbsp;invested with Bohemia by Rudolph, and his son Wenceslaus&nbsp;was betrothed to a daughter of the German king, who made&nbsp;a triumphal entry into Vienna. Ottakar, however, raised&nbsp;questions about the execution of the treaty, made an alliance&nbsp;with some Polish chiefs and procured the support of several&nbsp;German princes, including his former ally, Henry of lower&nbsp;Bavaria. To meet this combination Rudolph entered into&nbsp;alliance with Ladislaus IV. king of Hungary, and gave additional privileges to the citizens of Vienna. On the 26th of&nbsp;August 1278 the rival armies met on the banks of the river&nbsp;March near Dürnkrut, and Ottakar was defeated and killed.&nbsp;Moravia was subdued and its government entrusted to Rudolph’s&nbsp;representatives, while Wenceslaus was again betrothed to one&nbsp;of his daughters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rudolph’s attention was next turned to his new possessions in Austria and the adjacent countries. He spent several years&nbsp;in establishing his authority there, but found some difficulty in&nbsp;making these provinces hereditary in his family. At length&nbsp;the hostility of the princes was overcome, and in December&nbsp;1282 Rudolph invested his sons Albert and Rudolph with&nbsp;the duchies of Austria and Styria at Augsburg, and so&nbsp;laid the foundations of the greatness of the house of&nbsp;Habsburg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Turning to the west he compelled Philip I. count of upper Burgundy to cede some districts to him in 1281, forced the&nbsp;citizens of Berne to pay the tribute which they had previously&nbsp;refused, and in 1289 marched against Philip’s successor, Otto&nbsp;IV., and compelled him to do homage. In 1281 his first wife&nbsp;died, and on the 5th of February 1284 he married Isabella,&nbsp;daughter of Hugh IV. duke of Burgundy. Rudolph was not&nbsp;very successful in restoring internal peace to Germany. Orders&nbsp;were indeed issued for the establishment of landpeaces in&nbsp;Bavaria, Franconia and Swabia, and afterwards for the whole&nbsp;of Germany; but the king lacked the power, or the determination, to enforce them, although in December 1289 he led an&nbsp;expedition into Thuringia where he destroyed a number of&nbsp;robber-castles. In 1291 he attempted to secure the election of&nbsp;his son Albert as German king; but the princes refused on the&nbsp;pretext of their inability to support, two kings, but perhaps&nbsp;because they feared the increasing power of the Habsburgs.&nbsp;Rudolph died at Spires on the 15th of July 1291 and was buried&nbsp;in the cathedral of that city. He had a large family, but only&nbsp;one of his sons, Albert, afterwards the German king Albert I.,&nbsp;survived him. Rudolph was a tall man with pale face and&nbsp;prominent nose. He possessed many excellent qualities, bravery,&nbsp;piety and generosity; but his reign is memorable rather, in&nbsp;the history of the house of Habsburg than in that of the&nbsp;kingdom of Germany.</span></p>
