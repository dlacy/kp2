<p><span class="font0">neighbouring cities to have their </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ſtreets </span><span class="font0">well ſwept and watered to defend him from the dull. However, all&nbsp;theſe mighty preparations ended in nothing. Inſtead&nbsp;of conquering Britain, he only gave refuge to one of&nbsp;its baniſhed prinςes ; and this he deſcribed in a letter&nbsp;to the ſenate, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a∙3 </span><span class="font0">taking poſſeſſion of the whole iſland.&nbsp;Inſtead of conquering Germany, he only led his army&nbsp;to the ſea ſhore in Batavia. There· diſpoſing his engines and warlike machines with great ſolemnity, and&nbsp;drawing up his men in order of battle,, he went on&nbsp;<sup>ι</sup> board his galley, with which coaſting along, he commanded his trumpets to ſound and the ſignal to be given as if for an engagement ; upon which, his men having had previous orders, immediately fell to gathering&nbsp;the ſhells that lay upon the ſhore into their helmets,&nbsp;terming them the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſpoils of the conquered ocean worthy&nbsp;of the palace and the capitol.</span><span class="font0"> After this doughty expedition, calling his army together as a general after&nbsp;victory, he - harangued them in a pompous manner,&nbsp;and highly extolled their atchievements ; and then diſtributing money among them, diſmiſſed them with orders to be joyful, and congratulated them upon their&nbsp;riches. But that ſuch exploits ſhould not paſs without&nbsp;a memorial, he cauſed a loſty tower to be erected by&nbsp;the ſea-ſide ; and ordered the galleys in which he had&nbsp;put to ſea to be conveyed to Rome in a great meaſure&nbsp;by land.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After numberleſs inſtances of ſolly and cruelty in this expedition, among which he had intentions of deſtroying the whole army that had formerly mutinied&nbsp;under his father Germanicus, he began to think of a&nbsp;triumph. The ſenate, who had long been the timid&nbsp;miniſters of his pride and cruelty, immediately ſet about&nbsp;conſulting how to ſatisfy his expectations. They conſidered that a triumph would, even to himſelſ, appear&nbsp;as a burleſque upon his expedition : they therefore decreed him only an ovation. Having come to this reſolution, they ſent him a deputation, informing him of&nbsp;the honours granted him, and the decree, which was&nbsp;drawn up in terms of the moſt extravagant adulation.&nbsp;However, their flattery was far from ſatisfying his&nbsp;pride. He conſidered their conduct rather as a diminution of his power, than an addition to his glory.&nbsp;He therefore ordered them, on pain of death, not to&nbsp;concern themſelves with his honours; and being met&nbsp;by their meſſengers on the way, who invited him to&nbsp;come and partake of the preparations which the ſenate&nbsp;had decreed, he informed them that he would came ;&nbsp;and then laying his hand upon his ſword, added, that&nbsp;he would bring that alſo with him. In this m inner,&nbsp;either quite omitting his triumph, or deferring it to&nbsp;another time, he entered the city with only an ovation ;&nbsp;while the ſenate paſſed the whole day in acclamations&nbsp;in his praiſe, and ſpeeches filled with the moſt exceſſive flattery. This conduct in ſome meaſure ſerved to&nbsp;reconcile him, and ſoon after their exceſſive zeal in his&nbsp;cauſe entirely gained his favour. For it happened that&nbsp;Protogenes, who was one of the moſt intimate and the&nbsp;moſt cruel of his favourites, coming into the houſe,&nbsp;was fawned upon by the whole body of the ſenate, and&nbsp;particularly by Proculus. Whereupon Protogenes with&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">fierce look, alked how one who was ſuch an enemy&nbsp;to the emperor could be ſuch a friend to him ? There&nbsp;needed no more to excite the ſenate againſt Proculus.&nbsp;They inſtantly ſeized upon him, and violently tore him</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">in pieces ; plainly ſhowitg by their conduct, that </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ty</span><span class="font0">ranny in a prince produces cruelty in thoſe whom lie governs.—It was after returning from this extravagant&nbsp;expedition, that he was waited upon by a deputation&nbsp;of the Jews of Alexandria, who came to deprecate his&nbsp;anger ſor not worſhipping his divinity as other nations&nbsp;had done. The emperor gave them a very ungracious&nbsp;reception, and would probably have deſtroyed their&nbsp;countrymen if he had not ſoon alter been cut off.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This affair of the ∖Jews remained undecided during h’s reign ; but it was at laſt ſettled by his ſucceſſor to&nbsp;their ſatisfaction. It was upon this occaſion that Philo&nbsp;made the following remarkable anſwer to his aſſociates,&nbsp;who w<sup>,</sup>ere terrified with apprehenſions of the emperor’s&nbsp;indignation ; “ Fear nothing (cried he to them), Caligula, by declaring againſt us, puts God on our ſide.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The continuation of this horrid reign ſeemed to threaten univerſal calamity : however, it was but ſhort.&nbsp;There had already been ſeveral conſpiracies formed to&nbsp;deſtroy the tyrant, but without ſucceſs. That which&nbsp;at laſt ſucceeded in delivering the world of this monſter, was concerted under the influence of Caſſius Che-rea, tribune of the prætorian bands. This was a man&nbsp;of experienced courage, an ardent admirer of freedom,&nbsp;and conſequently an enemy to tyrants. Beſides the&nbsp;motives which he had in common with other men, he&nbsp;had received repeated inſults from Caligula, who took&nbsp;all occaſions of turning him into ridicule, and impeaching him of cowardice, merely becauſe he had an effeminate voice. Whenever Cherea came to demand the&nbsp;watch-word from the emperor, according to cuſtom,&nbsp;he always gave him either Venus, Adonis, or ſome&nbsp;ſuch, implying effeminacy and ſoftneſs. He therefore&nbsp;ſecretly imparted his deſigns to ſeveral ſenators and&nbsp;knights whom he knew to have received perſonal injuries from Caligula, or to be apprehenſive of thoſe to&nbsp;come. Among theſe was Valerius Aſiaticus, whoſe wife&nbsp;the emperor had debauched. Annius Vincianus, who&nbsp;was ſuſpected of having been in a former conſpiracy,&nbsp;was now deſirous of really engaging in the firſt deſign&nbsp;that offered Beſides theſe, were Clemens the preſect ;&nbsp;and Caliſtus, whoſe riches made him obnoxious to the:&nbsp;tyrant’s reſentment.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While theſe were deliberating upon the moſt certain and ſpeedy method of deſtroying the tyrant, an unexpected incident gave new’ ſtrength to the conſpiracy.&nbsp;Pompedius, a ſenator of diſtinction, having been accuſed before the errφeror, of having ſpoken of him with&nbsp;diſreſpect, the informer cited one Quintilia, an actreſs,&nbsp;to con ,rm his accuſation. Quintilia, however, was&nbsp;poſſeſſed of a degree of fortitude not eaſily found. She&nbsp;denied the fact with obſtinacy ; and being put to the&nbsp;torture at the informer’s requeſt, ſhe bore the ſevereſt&nbsp;torments of the rack with unſhaken conſtancy. But&nbsp;what is moſt remarkable of her reſolution is, that ſhe&nbsp;was acquainted with all the particulars of the conſpiracy ; and although Cherea was appointed to preſide&nbsp;at her torture ſhe revealed nothing : on the contrary,&nbsp;when ſhe was led to the rack, ſhe trod upon the toe of&nbsp;one of the conſpirators, intimating at once her knowledge of the confederacy, and her own reſolution not&nbsp;to divulge it. In this manner ſhe ſuffered until all her&nbsp;limbs were diſlocated ; and in that deplorable ſtate was&nbsp;preſented to the emperor, who ordered her a gratuity&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">for what ſhe </span><span class="font0">had ſuffered. Cherea could now no Ion-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
