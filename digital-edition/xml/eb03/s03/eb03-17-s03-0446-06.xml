the capital of Shropſhire in England, This town, the metropolis of the county, grew up out of the ruins of Uriconium, anciently a city, now a village called W <hi rend="italic">roxeter,</hi> about four miles from it. The Saxons called it <hi rend="italic">Scrοbbes Berig,</hi> from the ſhrubs that grew about it ; and from thence the preſent name of <hi rend="italic">Shrewsbury</hi> is ſuppoſed to have been formed. It is pleaſantly ſituated upon a hill near the Severn, over which there are two handſome bridges. It was a place of note in the Saxon times ; after which it was granted by William the Conqueror, together with the title of <hi rend="italic">earl</hi> and moſt of the county, to Roger de Montgomery, who built a caſtle upon the north side of it, where the Severn, that encompasses it on all other ſides, leaves an opening. His ſon Robert built alſo a wall acroſs this neck of land, when he revolted<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0453.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0447"/>
from Henry I. We learn from doomſday-book, that at that time, when a widow of this town married, ſhe paid 20 ſhillings to the king, and a virgin 10. The above-mentioned Roger founded alſo, and endowed here, a Benedictine monastery and a collegiate church. When old age came upon him, he quitted the world, and ſpent the rest of his days as a monk in the abbey, and when he died was interred in its church. From the hiſtory of this church and monaſtery, it appears, that eccleſiaſtical benefices about that time were hereditary. The abbey became so rich afterwards, that the abbot was mitred, and sat in parliament. Beſides this abbey, in after times there were three others, viz. a Eranciſcan, Dominican, and Auguſtin, and likewiſe two collegiate churches ; one dedicated to St Chad and the other to St Mary. In the conteſt between the empreſs Maud and Stephen, this town, and its governor William Fitz-Allan, ſided with the empreſs. In Henry III.’s time, a part of it was burnt down by the Welch ; and in Richard II.'s reign a parliament was held in it. At a place called <hi rend="italic">Battlefield,</hi> near this town, Henry Percy the younger, ſurnamed <hi rend="italic">Hotſpur,</hi> was killed in an engagement with Henry IV. againſt whom he had rebelled. The king afterwards built a chapel upon the ſpot, and endowed it ſor the support of two prieſts to pray for the souls of the ſlain. Two of Edw. IV.’s ſons were born here ; namely, Richard, duke of York, whom Perkin Warbeck afterwards personated, and who was murdered in the Tower; and George Plantagenet, who died before his brothers. Here firſt broke out the ſweating-ſickneſs, which carried off great numbers ſo ſuddenly, that thoſe who were ſeized with it either died or recovered in the ſpace of 24 hours. In the beginning of the civil wars, king Charles I. came hither, and formed an army, with which he marched towards London ; but was met by the parliament’s forces at Edgehill. He continued here from the 20th of September to the 12th of October, during which time he was joined by prince Rupert, and many of the gentry and nobility of theſe parts. This town anciently gave title of earl to the Montgomeries, and afterwards to the Talbots, by whom it is ſtill retained. Here is a free grammar-school, with three masters, and ſeveral uſhers, well endowed by Edward VI. and queen Elizabeth, and not inferior to many colleges in the universities. It has a good library and chapel, and there are ſeveral ſcholarships appropriated to it in the univerſity of Cambridge. Here are also ſeveral hospitals, alms-houses, and charity-ſchools. This town is one of the moſt flouriſhing in England, having two great weekly markets for corn, cattle, and proviſions ; and another for Welch cottons and flannels, of which great quantities are sold. A great trade is carried on with the Welch, who bring their commodities hither, as to the common mart of both nations. The town is large and well-built, and the ſituation extremely pleaſant. There is a very beautiful walk called the <hi rend="italic">quarry,</hi> between the town walls and the Severn, delightfully shaded with rows of lime-trees, ſo that it is not inferior to the Mall in St James’s Park. The town is alſo noted ſor its gallantry and politeneſs, being full of gentry, for whom there are always balls and asſemblies once a-week all the year round.— Here is a fine houſe and gardens, which belonged to the earl of Bradford ; and in the neighbourhood, at Wroxeter, the Roman highway, called Watling-ſtreet,</p><p>may be ſeen for ſeveral miles, where Roman coins are frequently found. In Shrewſhury are 12 incorporated trading companies ; and the corporation has a power to try even capital cauſes of itſelf, except high treaſon. It is ſaid that thigh-hones of dead men have been found here a yard long, and teeth three inches round and three long.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
