<p><span class="font0">the continuous system is mostly used; here the rope is wound round and round over driver and driven, and, except in rare&nbsp;cases, is joined only at one place. Although the system has the&nbsp;great advantage of the minimum number of joinings, it requires&nbsp;tension pulleys to keep the ropes taut. It is also clear that&nbsp;when the rope breaks at any point the machinery must stand&nbsp;until the repair is completed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wire Ropes.—</span><span class="font0">Although the manufacture of ropes is of ancient origin, the practice of making ropes from wire on a large scale is of&nbsp;comparatively recent date. Since 1874, however, great developments have taken place in the manufacture of ropes from different&nbsp;kinds of wire, and the uses to which they can be put have enormously&nbsp;increased. This is owing almost entirely to the introduction of&nbsp;flexible wire ropes which were invented about this time by Messrs&nbsp;Bullivant &amp; Co. Ltd., of 72 Mark Lane, London, E.C. Prior to that&nbsp;date the uses at which wire ropes were put were limited to winding&nbsp;ropes for collieries and hauling, and to cases in which flexibility was&nbsp;not a great desideratum. The introduction of flexibility,, however,&nbsp;made possible the use of wire rope for ships’ hawsers and rigging, for&nbsp;cranes, derricks and other purposes for which hempen ropes were&nbsp;formerly employed—indeed it has almost entirely superseded hemp&nbsp;for marine uses. The reason is that it is much stronger for the same&nbsp;size than rope made from any other material, whilst for the same&nbsp;strength its size and weight are only about one-third that, of hempen&nbsp;rope. Consequently, the required power may be obtained with a&nbsp;wire rope of comparatively small bulk.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wire rope is specially suited for aerial’ ropeways which provide a means of conveying ore, metals, merchandise, &amp;e., over ground&nbsp;where it would be difficult to arrange transport by ordinary means.&nbsp;Messrs Bullivant &amp; Co. Ltd., to whom we are indebted for the table&nbsp;of strengths and other particulars, as well as for the sectional&nbsp;illustration of wire ropes, construct seven different systems of&nbsp;aerial ropeways:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The endless running rope, with carriers hanging therefrom</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and moving with it.through frictional contact.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An endless rope, with the carriers hanging therefrom and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">moving with it, being rigidly fixed in position on the rope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fixed rope, in which the carriers are drawn along and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">hang from a fixed rope which acts also as a rail, returning on a parallel rope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The single fixed rope, in which* one carrier, hanging from a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">fixed rope, is drawn to and fro by means of an endless hauling rope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of two fixed ropes with an endless hauling rope, in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which one carrier travels in one direction, while the other travels on a parallel rope in the opposite direction. This&nbsp;is a serviceable type of ropeway, capable of being used&nbsp;over extremely long spans, and of carrying loads up to&nbsp;5 tons.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of one fixed rope placed on an incline, on which the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">carriers (uncontrolled by hauling ropes) with their suspended loads are allowed to run down at a high speed. This is&nbsp;generally called a “ shoot.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bullivant’s system of aerial ropeway for raising, lowering,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and transporting heavy loads, by means of which a load can be hoisted, traversed in either direction and deposited at&nbsp;one. operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;. •</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The flexibility of a wire rope depends upon the number of wires of which it is formed; consequently the use to. which a rope is to&nbsp;be put will partly determine the number of wires used in its construction. In some cases nearly 400 individual wires are employed&nbsp;in making one rope. Fig. 8 shows in section ten different types of&nbsp;construction, the particulars of which appear below:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Laid rope made of 6 strands of 7 wires each. This is the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">class of rope most frequently used for hauling, ropes where the size of the barrel and sheave will permit; it is also the make&nbsp;of rope in general use for standing rigging, and is such as is&nbsp;required by Lloyd’s regulations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hauling rope made of 6 strands, each strand being of 7 wires</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">covering 7 smaller ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hauling rope made of 6 strands, each of 8 wires covering</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7 smaller ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hauling rope made of 6 strands, each of 10 wires covering</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7 smaller ones.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Formed rope made of 6. strands of 19 wires each. In larger</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">sizes this make of rope is used for standing rigging on vessels. In smaller sizes it is sometimes used for running rigging, and&nbsp;it is the usual make of rope for trawl warps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flexible steel wire rope, made of 6 strands each of 12 wires,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">with hemp heart and hemp centre in each strand. This is the usual make of flexible steel wire rope, 4I in. in circumference and smaller; used for hawsers, running lifts, hoists,&nbsp;&amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Extra flexible steel wire rope made of 6 strands each of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">24 wires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special extra flexible steel wire rope made of 6 strands each of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">37 wires.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Special extra flexible steel wire rope made of 6 strands each of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">61 wires. This is the make of rope usually adopted for large ropes—say over io* in. in circumference—which are largely&nbsp;used for slipway and salvage purposes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cable-laid rope. This is an obsolete form of rope, which is&nbsp;composed of six complete ropes twisted together.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The diameter of drums and sheaves should be about thirty times the circumference of the rope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For shaft winding at high speed one-tenth of the breaking strain of a rope is sometimes taken as a fair working load. For inclines,&nbsp;the proportion of load to breaking strain varies according to gradient&nbsp;conditions, and friction should be allowed for.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first requisite in the manufacture of wire ropes is the selection and blending of the different iron ores. The different processes&nbsp;through which the metal passes, and the hammering and drawing&nbsp;into rods, require great experience, and give to it the peculiar properties that are essential for the finished article. The same remarks&nbsp;apply to the annealing and hardening processes, during which the&nbsp;rods are drawn through dies to the required gauge. The wire is&nbsp;now subjected to special processes of galvanizing in order to make it&nbsp;proof against atmospheric and other influences. Afterwards it is&nbsp;wound on bobbins of suitable size, a definite number of which are&nbsp;mounted on the forks or frames of the stranding machine. These&nbsp;forks are swung or pivoted between disks, which are keyed on a&nbsp;hollow main shaft, through which the wires or other material</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
