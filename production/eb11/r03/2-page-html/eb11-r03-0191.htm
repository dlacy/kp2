<p><span class="font1">pass. An alternative is the three-high mill, in which three rolls are used. Here the plate is run through&nbsp;the lower rolls and back through the&nbsp;upper ones, so that there is no reversal&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">direction of the mill as a whole,&nbsp;but the Iower and upper’rolls draw&nbsp;the pIates in opposite directions (see&nbsp;also </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Iron and Steel,</span><span class="font1"> § 129).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Plate-Mills,—</span><span class="font1">In Great Britain plate-mills are generally two-high reversing mills, in America three-high mills. Another difference is that&nbsp;in British practice two stands of rolls are used, in America one&nbsp;only.. In the two-stand design there arc two sets of rolls coupled&nbsp;endwise, one set being grain-rolls for roughing, and the other chilled&nbsp;rolls for finishing. Sets of live rollers conduct the plates to and from&nbsp;the separate rolls. The plate-mills proper are those which roll&nbsp;from i in. to about 2 in. thick. Armour plate-mills are a special&nbsp;design for massive plates and sheet-mills are for thin plates or sheets&nbsp;having a less thickness than J in. Armour plate-mills are of two-high reversing type usually, with forged steel rolls. They are of&nbsp;immense proportions, the rollers ranging from 10 to 14 ft. in length,&nbsp;by from 3 to 4 ft. in diameter. In sheet-mills, on the other hand,&nbsp;the rolls seldom exceed 30 in. in diameter, and they are chilled.&nbsp;The size of sheet-mills has within the last few years been considerably increased (since the introduction of steel sheets), and all new&nbsp;mills are made from 28 to 30 in. diameter. The mills are of the two-high type and arc almost the only instance of the retention in&nbsp;present practice of the non-reversing mill. It is found more convenient in this case than the reversing or the three-high mills,&nbsp;because two men roll two pieces at once, one handing over a sheet&nbsp;just rolled to his fellow just as the latter has entered a sheet between&nbsp;the rolls on his side. Strip-mills are a smaller but similar type,&nbsp;used for rolling the thin narrow strips required for the hoops of&nbsp;barrels, ties for cotton bales, &amp;c. The details of these mills cannot&nbsp;be discussed here, nor the numerous arguments Jn favour of the&nbsp;two systems. English practice retains the two-high reversing mill&nbsp;for all heavy work, the exceptions being those just noted. American&nbsp;practice retains the three-high mill.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Grooved Rolls.—</span><span class="font1">In the mills designed for rolling various sectional forms the same distinction between two-high and threedugh remains, but new problems arise. By “ sectional forms ” is meant&nbsp;all those which are qpt plates and sheets, such as bars of round&nbsp;and square section, angles, channels, rails and allied sections (fig. ï),&nbsp;for the production of which grooved rolls are required. . The&nbsp;shapes and proportions of these grooves are such that reduction is&nbsp;effected very gradually. WTen metal is squeezed or hammered, one&nbsp;effect is to spread it laterally, since the metal cannot be appreciably&nbsp;squeezed in on itself. But the lateral extension is very much less than</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
