The disturbance of the natural order of succession was seized by the discontented as a favourable pretext for insurrection ; and the reign of the new emperor was opened by a military mutiny in St Petersburg, which, after having been suppressed with bloodshed, was followed by several executions, and many imprisonments and banishments to Siberia. Nicholas, and his spouse, the princess royal of Prussia, were crowned at Moscow in 1826, and at Warsaw in 1829. The latter of these two ceremonies did not long precede the revolution of Poland, which has been the most remarkable event of the emperor’s reign. It is unnecessary to repeat the circumstances of that unfortunate struggle. The whole character and policy of Nicholas have been similar to those of his brother since 1815, with, however, an additional degree of force and boldness, which may be attributable partly to the natural progress of the political tactics which were common to both, and partly to the more energetic will and greater attachment to military principles and forms which distinguish the younger brother.</p><p>If we look to the three questions which were described above as forming the main business of Alexander in his foreign policy, we find the position of Russia regarding them to have remained, with slight alterations, the same since the commencement of the new reign as it was before. The anti-constitutional views of the Holy Alliance have been necessarily modified, but not abandoned ; although Nicholas speedily recognised the title of Louis Philippe to the French throne, and took an active share in the conferences of the five powers at London for arranging the affairs of Belgium and Holland. On the side of Turkey, Russia has, during the last fifteen years, been rapidly gaining strength. The treaty of Akjerman between the two powers in 1826, extending the principles laid down in the peace of Buka-rescht, was ill executed on both sides ; and the mutual misunderstanding, being still further complicated by the emergence of the Greek question, issued first in the battle of Navarino, and afterwards in a regular war of two years between Russia and the Porte. The first campaign, in 1828, was favourable to Russia, but not completely decisive ; that of 1829 was celebrated for the successful passage of the Balkan by the Russian general Diebitsch<hi rend="sub">1</hi> and was closed in September by the peace of Adrianople, in which Turkey consented to several articles both humiliating and injurious. Russia received but a slight direct accession of territory, but obtained a confirmation of the right of her vessels to navigate the Black Sea, a definitive settlement of frontier towards Turkey, and a recognition of such restrictions on the Turkish government of Moldavia and Wallachia as materially weakened the sultan’s power. The fortresses of these provinces were moreover to be garrisoned by Russian troops, till the Porte should have paid to Russia the expenses of the war ; and accordingly the provinces were not evacuated till 1834. Diplomatic skill, and other means less justifiable, strengthened the hold of Russia on the Porte, whose weakness was completely exposed in 1832, when Russian troops appeared as its protectors against its own rebellious subject the viceroy of Egypt. Turkey, in short, has in the mean time thrown herself unreservedly under the influence of Russia, and it appears not improbable that the course of events may very soon allow that influence a yet more favourable field. The most conspicuous incident of recent Russian history on the side of India has been the war with Persia, commenced in 1826, carried on successfully by the generals Yermoloft'and Paskewitsch<hi rend="sub">1</hi> and terminated in 1828 by the cession of some important provinces to Russia. (See</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Persia.) Since that time, both in Persia and in the neutral countries on the frontiers of British India, there is little reason to doubt that the Russian diplomacy has been acquiring an increasing influence. The only actual accession of territory to Russia in this quarter that deserves notice was given in 1829 by the revolt of the Kirghis Tartars, formerly subject to China, who now placed themselves under the sovereignty of Russia, and brought the Russian frontier nearer by another step to our Asiatic possessions.</hi></p><p>Internally Russia has had to contend with incursions of' the Caucasian hordes from beyond the frontier, with revolts &lt; of the Lesghians and other tribes nominally subject to the<hi rend="sup">1 </hi>empire, and lately with an extensive and spirited insurrection of the Circassians, which it has not yet been possible to quell.</p><p>The domestic government of Nicholas has little to dis- : tinguish it from tbat of his brother. Education has been ∣ to some extent more favoured than it had recently been by<hi rend="sup">1 </hi>Alexander ; the Catholic and Lutheran churches continue to receive the support of the government, which has also aided missions to the Calmucks and other nomadic hordes; trade and manufactures have been furthered by regulations devised with much intelligence ; and the laws have since 1826 received a tolerably complete revision and concentration.</p><p>√</p><p>STATISTICS.</p><p>The Russian empire is of enormous extent, of vast resources, and of great capacity of improvement. It forms a connected territory, extending from the frontiers of Germany and Prussia, and the shores of the Gulf of Bothnia, eastward to the sea which separates Asia from America, thus embracing nearly one half of Europe and all the north of Asia. Beyond Behring’s Straits it extends over a portion of the north-west territory of America, embracing at the same time a number of islands situated in the ocean which washes the northern shores of Europe and Asia, and flows between Asia and America. Its most westerly point is in longitude 18° 20<hi rend="sup">,</hi>15", and its most easterly in 209° 14' east from Greenwich, thus extending through about 190 degrees of longitude. Its northern and southern boundaries have deep indentations ; the extreme points of the former are in 78° 4<hi rend="sup">,</hi>, and of the latter in 38° 40<hi rend="sup">,</hi> of north latitude. This empire embraces about the one-ninth (some estimate it as high as the one-seventh) part of the habitable globe, the one-fourteenth part of tbe northern hemisphere, and above the one twenty-eighth part of the superficies of our planet. The whole of China is not equal to two thirds of Russia ; and the Roman empire, at the period of its greatest extension, did not comprehend more than one fourth of the territory which now bows to the sceptre of the czar. Some have included the mountains of Caucasus, others the whole of the Caspian Sea, whilst some again have omitted the one and not the other. A very elaborate calculation of the superficies of Russia has, within these few years, been published by M. Sernoff, who has invented an improved method of computing areas, by which he can allow for the inequalities of boundaries. “ Russia in Europe, including Russian Poland and the islands of the Baltic and German Ocean, contains 2,078,646-∣⅛¼<hi rend="sub">i</hi>  English square miles, of which 151,049¼'<hi rend="sub">l</hi>¼<hi rend="sub">l</hi>  lie within the frigid zone, and l,927,598-<hi rend="sub">j</hi>½⅛ within the temperate zone.
