They are&nbsp;likewiſe trained againſt walls or palings, like other wall-trees, but principally ſome of the large red and white&nbsp;Dutch currants, in which they wall produce fine large&nbsp;fruit, and thoſe againſt any ſouth fence will ripen early, and be high flavoured ; but it is proper to plant a&nbsp;few both againſt ſouth, north, eaſt, and weft walls, in&nbsp;order to obtain the fruit ripe both early and late, in&nbsp;a long ſucceſſion. It is alſo proper to plant a few of&nbsp;the fineſt ſorts of gooſeberries againſt a warm fence,&nbsp;both to have early green gooſeberries for tarts, &amp;c. as&nbsp;well as to ripen early ; and they will grow very large&nbsp;and fine. Sometimes both currants and gooſeberries&nbsp;are alſo trained in low eſpaliers for variety, and they&nbsp;produce very fine fruit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fruits both of the currant and gooſeberry are of an acid and cooling nature, and as ſuch are ſome-times uſed in medicine, eſpecially the juice reduced to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">jelly by boiling with ſugar. From the juice of currants alſo a very agreeable wine is made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RICAUT, or Rycaut (Sir Paul), an eminent Engliſh traveller, of the time of whoſe birth we find&nbsp;no account ; but in 166r, he was appointed ſecretary&nbsp;to the earl of Winchelſea, who was ſent ambaſſador&nbsp;extraordinary to the Ottoman Porte. During his&nbsp;continuance in that ſtation, he wrote, “ The preſent&nbsp;State of the Ottoman Empire, in three books, containing the maxims of the Turkiſh policy, their religion,&nbsp;and military diſcipline,” London, folio, 1670. He afterwards reſided 1 x years as conſnl at Smyrna, where,&nbsp;at the command of Charles II. he compoſed “ The preſent ſtate of the Greek and Armenian Churches, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">anno&nbsp;Cl)r∙ifti</span><span class="font0"> 1678.” On his return, Lord Clarendon being&nbsp;appointed lord-lieutenant of Ireland, made him his principal ſecretary for Leinſter and Connaught : king&nbsp;James II. knighted him ; and made him one of the privy council in Ireland, and judge of the court of admiralty ; all which he held to the Revolution. He was&nbsp;employed by King William as reſident at the Hanſe-towns in Lower Saxony, where he continued for ten&nbsp;years ; but being worn out with age and infirmities, he&nbsp;obtained leave to return in 1700, and died the fame year.&nbsp;Ricaut continued “ Knolles’s Hiſtory of the Turks,&nbsp;and Platina’s Lives of the Popes beſides which, there&nbsp;are ſome other productions under his name.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RICE. SeeθRYZA. “ Rice </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bras,</span><span class="font0"> (ſays MrMarf∙ den) whilſt in the hulk, is in India called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paddee,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;aſſumes a different name in each of its other various&nbsp;ſtates. We obſerve no diſtinction of this kind in Europe, where our grain retains through all its ſtages, till&nbsp;it becomes flour, its original name of barley, -wheat, or&nbsp;oats. The following, beſide many others, are names&nbsp;applied to rice, in its different ſtages of growth and preparation: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paddee,</span><span class="font0"> original name of the ſeed: </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">oojſay,</span><span class="font0"> grain&nbsp;of laſt ſeaſon : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">buηηee,</span><span class="font0"> the plants before removed to the&nbsp;ſawoors : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bras</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bray,</span><span class="font0"> rice, the huſk of the paddee being taken off : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">charroop,</span><span class="font0"> rice cleaned for boiling ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">naſſe,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">boiled rice : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peeraηg,</span><span class="font0"> yellow rice : </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jambar,</span><span class="font0"> a ſervice of&nbsp;rice, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Among people whoſe general objects of contemplation are few, thoſe which do of neceſſity engage their attention, are often more nicely diſcriminated than the&nbsp;fame objects among more enlightened people, whoſe&nbsp;ideas ranging over the extenſive field of art and ſeience,&nbsp;diſdain to fix long on obvious and common matters.*&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Paddee, </span><span class="font0">on Sumatra and the Malay iſlands, is diftin-guiſhed into two ſorts ; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Laddang</span><span class="font0"> or up-land paddee,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saιvoor</span><span class="font0"> or low-land, which are always kept ſeparate, and will not grow reciprocally. Of theſe the&nbsp;former bears the higher price, being a whiter, heartier,&nbsp;and better flavoured grain, and having the advantage in&nbsp;point of keeping. The latter is much more prolific&nbsp;from the ſeed, and liable to leſs rifle in the culture, but&nbsp;is of a watery ſubſtance, produces leſs increaſe in boiling, and is ſubject to a ſwiſter decay. It is, however,&nbsp;in more common uſe than the former. Beſide this general diſtinction, the paddee of each fort, particularly&nbsp;the Laddang, preſents a variety of ſpecies, which, as&nbsp;far as my information extends, I ſhall enumerate, and&nbsp;endeavour to deſcribe. The common kind of dry ground&nbsp;paddee : colour, light brown : the ſize rather large, and&nbsp;very little crooked at the extremity. Paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">undallong:&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">dry ground : ſhort round grain : grows in whorles or&nbsp;bunches round the ſtock. Paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ebbaſs:</span><span class="font0"> dry ground :&nbsp;large grain : common. Paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gαlloo</span><span class="font0"> .∙ dry ground :&nbsp;light coloured : ſcarce. Paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſennee :</span><span class="font0"> dry ground :&nbsp;deep coloured ; ſmall grain : ſcarce. Paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ejoo :</span><span class="font0"> dry-ground ; light coloured. Paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kooning :</span><span class="font0"> dry ground :&nbsp;deep yelfow : fine rice : crooked, and pointed. Paddee&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coocoor ballum :</span><span class="font0"> dry ground : much eſteemed : light coloured ; ſmall, and very much crooked, reſetnbling </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">dove’s nail, ſrom whence its name. Paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peſang :&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">dιy ground : outer coat light brown ; inner red : longer, ſmaller, and leſs crooked than the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coocoor ballum.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Saηtong :</span><span class="font0"> the fineſt ſort that is planted in wet&nbsp;ground : ſmall, ſtraight, and light coloured. In general&nbsp;it may be obſerved that the larger grained rice is the&nbsp;leaſt eſteemed, and the ſmaller and whiter the moſt&nbsp;prized. In the Lampoon country they make </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">diſtinction of paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cranυaηg</span><span class="font0"> and paddee </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jerroo ;</span><span class="font0"> the former&nbsp;of which is a month earlier in growth than the latter.”</span></p>
