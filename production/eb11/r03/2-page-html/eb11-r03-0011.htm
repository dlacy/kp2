<p><span class="font1">RICHARDIA, à small genus of the nat. ord. Araceae, native in South Africa, to which the “ arum lily ” belongs. They are&nbsp;all greenhouse herbaceous plants of handsome appearance,&nbsp;with thick underground stems and large, more or less fleshy,&nbsp;long-stalked, arrow-shaped leaves and white or yellow flower&nbsp;spathes. They are readily propagated by division of the shoot,&nbsp;also by seed. Water should be given abundantly at all times,&nbsp;and the soil for potting should be rich and retentive. Potting&nbsp;is best effected in spring, and from the end of June to the end&nbsp;of August they should be plunged in a sunny spot out of doors.&nbsp;They will not withstand frost, and should be wintered in a warm&nbsp;greenhouse. They flower throughout the year.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHARDS, ALFRED BATE (1820-1876), English journalist, was born in Worcestershire on the 17th of February 1820, and&nbsp;was educated at Westminster School and Exeter College, Oxford.&nbsp;After taking his degree in 1841 he published, anonymously,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Oxford Unmasked,</span><span class="font1"> a denunciation of abuses in the university.&nbsp;Between 1845 and 1848 he wrote several dramas and some&nbsp;poetry, and in the latter year became editor of a weekly newspaper, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">British Army Despatch.</span><span class="font1"> His temperament was&nbsp;strongly Imperialist; he opposed Cobden and the Manchester&nbsp;school of politicians, and in a volume entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Britain Redeemed&nbsp;and Canada Preserved</span><span class="font1"> predicted, thirty years before the event,&nbsp;the construction of the Canadian Pacific railway. In 1855 he&nbsp;was appointed the first editor of the London </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;through the medium of that journal strongly urged the formation of volunteer rifle corps. The National and Constitutional&nbsp;Defence Association was established in 1858 to carry out the&nbsp;idea. Richards himself raised a regiment of a thousand working&nbsp;men in London, becoming major and subsequently colonel of&nbsp;the corps. In 1870 he was appointed editor of the London&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Morning Advertiser,</span><span class="font1"> and retained this position till his death&nbsp;on the 12th of June 1876.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHARDS, HENRY BRINLEY (1819-1865), English pianist and composer, was born at Carmarthen, and educated&nbsp;at the Royal Academy of Music in London, where later he was&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">professor. He took much interest in Welsh music and in&nbsp;the Eisteddfod gatherings. He was a prolific composer, but is&nbsp;perhaps principally remembered for writing the song “ God&nbsp;bless the Prince of Wales ” (1862), which has been adopted&nbsp;as an English national anthem.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHARDS, WILLIAM TROST (1833-1905), American marine painter, was born at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on the&nbsp;14th of November 1833. He was a pupil of Paul Weber in his&nbsp;native city, and lived much in France, Italy and London. He&nbsp;was a member of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts,&nbsp;and of the American Water Colour Society. Examples of his&nbsp;work are in the collections of the Pennsylvania Academy of the&nbsp;Fine Arts, Philadelphia, Penn.; the Metropolitan Museum of&nbsp;Art, New York, the Corcoran Art Gallery, Washington, D.C.,&nbsp;and the Schaube Gallery, Hamburg. He died at Newport,&nbsp;Rhode Island, on the 8th of November 1905.

<p><span class="font1">RICHARDSON, GEORGE, English 18th-century architect and designer. The dates of birth and death of this distinguished&nbsp;contemporary and rival of the brothers Adam are not ascertained, but he is conjectured to have been bom about 1736&nbsp;and to have died in 1817. Richardson spent three years—&nbsp;from 1760 to 1763—travelling in Dalmatia and Istria, in the&nbsp;south of France and in Italy. During that period he imbibed'&nbsp;the inspiration of a lifetime, and acquired the material for its&nbsp;practical application. He soon began to show remarkable&nbsp;skill in adapting classical ideals to the uses of his time, and in&nbsp;1765 he won a premium offered, by the Society of Arts for a&nbsp;design of a street in the classical manner. Richardson’s work&nbsp;is so closely allied to that of the brothers Adam that it is often&nbsp;difficult to distinguish between them, and if it possessed less&nbsp;freedom and variety, and bore to a smaller extent the impress&nbsp;of an original mind, it was in the main exceedingly admirable&nbsp;and satisfying. Richardson was an especially successful&nbsp;designer of ceilings and chimneypieces. He published in 1776&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Book of Ceilings in the Style of the Antique Grotesque.</span><span class="font1"> Many&nbsp;of its drawings are of exquisite taste. Nor is his fireplace&nbsp;work, as represented by his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Collection of Chimneypieces Ornamented in the Style of the Etruscan, Greek and Roman Architecture</span><span class="font1"> (1781), less attractive. Richardson’s chimneypieces are&nbsp;still to be found in considerable numbers in town and country&nbsp;houses. They are mostly of marble, but examples in wood&nbsp;are not uncommon. He made extensive use of coloured&nbsp;marbles, and the effect is constantly that of the sumptuous&nbsp;balancing the austere. Like the Adams, Richardson often&nbsp;worked with composition enrichments, and his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New Designs&nbsp;in Architecture</span><span class="font1"> (1792) contains many drawings of interior&nbsp;friezes and columns to be executed either in this medium or&nbsp;painted to suit the wall hangings. His versatility was considerable, as the titles of his works, a dozen in number, suggest.&nbsp;For many years he exhibited at the Royal Academy as well&nbsp;as in the Galleries of the Society of Arts. Why such a man&nbsp;should have fallen into penury in his old age we have no means&nbsp;of ascertaining, but we know that his necessities were relieved&nbsp;by Nollekens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">His principal works in addition to those already mentioned were; in chronological order; </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aedes Pernbrochianae</span><span class="font1"> (1774); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Jconology </span><span class="font1">(2 vols.), with plates by Bartolozzi and other engravers (1778-1779) ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">New Designs in Architecture</span><span class="font1"> (1792); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Original Designs for Country&nbsp;Seats or Villas</span><span class="font1"> (1795); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The New Vitruvius Britannicus<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1"> a sequel to&nbsp;Colin Campbell’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vitruvius Britanniens,</span><span class="font1"> 2 vols. (1802); </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ornaments&nbsp;in the Grecian, Roman and Etruscan Tastes</span><span class="font1"> (1816). He also published volumes dealing with vases and tripods, antique friezes and&nbsp;other architectural and decorative details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICHARDSON, HENRY HOBSON (1838-1886), American architect, was born-in the parish of St James, Louisiana, on&nbsp;the 29th of September 1838, of a rich family, his mother being&nbsp;a granddaughter of the famous Dr Priestley, the English dissenting refugee and man of science. He was graduated from&nbsp;Harvard University in 1859, and going immediately to Paris&nbsp;to study architecture, entered the École des Beaux-Arts. The&nbsp;Civil War, which broke out in the United States while he was&nbsp;in the school, prevented his return to Louisiana, and stripped&nbsp;his family of their possessions, so that Richardson provided&nbsp;for his own support by working in the offices of practising&nbsp;architects in Paris, till the fall of 1865. Coming back, he&nbsp;established himself in New York, where he soon made his </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">way&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">into practice as an architect. In 1878 he moved to Boston,&nbsp;where he passed the remaining years of his life, designing there&nbsp;most of the work that made his reputation. He had married&nbsp;in 1867 Miss Julia Gorham Hayden of Boston; he died on the&nbsp;27th of April 1886, not yet forty-eight years old.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Richardson’s career was short, and the number of his works was small indeed compared with the attention they attracted&nbsp;and the influence he left behind him. The most important&nbsp;and characteristic are: Trinity church and the so-called&nbsp;Brattle Square church, in Boston; the alterations in the State&nbsp;Capitol at Albany; the county buildings at Pittsburg; town&nbsp;halls at Albany, Springfield and North Easton; town libraries&nbsp;at Woburn, North Easton, Quincy, Burlington and Malden;&nbsp;Sever Hall and Austin Hall at Harvard University; the&nbsp;Chamber of Commerce at Cincinnati. Trinity church, the&nbsp;Pittsburg buildings and the Capitol at Albany were works of&nbsp;great importance, which have had a strong influence on men</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
