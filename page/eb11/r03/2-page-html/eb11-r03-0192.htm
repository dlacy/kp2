<p><span class="font0">the longitudinal. The most marked effect of reduction in thickness is extension in length. But as there is some lateral extension, three&nbsp;courses are open: one is to gauge the exact amount of width required for extension; another is to turn a bar over at intervals in&nbsp;order to exercise pressure on the portions extended laterally and&nbsp;obliterate them (open passes) ; and a third is to allow the extensions&nbsp;to take the form of fin to be cut off subsequently (closed passes).&nbsp;The first is generally impracticable. The second can be illustrated&nbsp;by diagrams representing roll sections.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The work of reduction is generally divided between three sets of rolls. The first are the cogging-, or blooming-rolls, as they are&nbsp;termed in America, in which ingots are reduced to blooms with&nbsp;dimensions suitable for rolling the various sections. In these an&nbsp;ingot of say 14 in. square may be reduced to a bloom of 6 in. square.&nbsp;The grooves form rectangular sections (box passes). The top&nbsp;roll being raised, the ingot is passed through the largest groove;&nbsp;then the roll is lowered and it is passed through a second time.&nbsp;Then it is turned round through 90° and re-rolled. Afterwards&nbsp;the same processes are gone through till the last groove is reached.&nbsp;There is a great difference between, say, a plate and a rail, but the&nbsp;cogging-rolls have to be so designed as to produce blooms for varied&nbsp;forms. There are three principal forms: the box just noticed,&nbsp;the gothic and the diamond (fig. 4), all open passes. For plates,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">provision is made in “ slabbing ” rolls for roughing out, first in a box pass, and then in a broad flat groove, alternating with&nbsp;the square groove for correction of the edges. Gothic passes and&nbsp;diamond passes produce blooms which are subsequently used for&nbsp;various shapes having little resemblance to each other. Thege&nbsp;shapes are simple, and little difficulty arises in the work of&nbsp;drawing down. The rolls make 40 to 50 revolutions per minute;&nbsp;the difference in the area of the cross section (draught) between&nbsp;adjacent grooves is from 20 to 25%.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The formative rolls for finished sections are of two classes: roughing and finishing. The roughing-rolls approximate much&nbsp;more closely to the finished sections than the cogging-rolls, but&nbsp;the aim is to make them do duty for a wide range of sections, in&nbsp;order to change them as seldom as possible. Thus the gothic pass&nbsp;(fig. 4) will serve alike for rolling square or round bars. Finishing&nbsp;rolls must be changed for every different section, except when slight&nbsp;differences in thicknesses only are made in the webbed portion&nbsp;of a rolled section. With the exception of rounds,, sections are&nbsp;usually roughed and finished in closed passes—that is, the bar is&nbsp;wholly enclosed by the rolls. The groove in the lower roll is flanked&nbsp;by collars slightly deeper than the enclosed bar. These enter into&nbsp;grooves turned on the upper roll, and between them the bar Is&nbsp;confined (fig. 5). lt passes, through a succession of these grooves,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">being diminished in area and extended at each pass. A certain amount of fin is squeezed out, and this is obliterated in the succeeding pass, and more formed, until in the finishing pass the amount&nbsp;of reduction is very slight, a surface finish being the principal&nbsp;result.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Since but a slight amount of lateral extension occurs, it follows that the reduction wholly or mainly in the vertical plane is the&nbsp;most favourable condition. Rounds, squares and flats are wholly&nbsp;reduced in this way and offer no difficulty. The most unfavourable&nbsp;section is the joist or girder, the channels, tees and rails follow,&nbsp;and after these the various angles. In rolling a channel or a girder&nbsp;section (figs. 6, 7, 8), a square bloom is taken, and passed in succession through closed passes. The first produce shallow grooves in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the opposite faces, gradually deepening until the insides of the flanges assume a definite slope. The angle of slope becomes gradually lessened, and the thicknesses of web and flanges, and also the&nbsp;radius in the corners, are reduced. At the same time the width&nbsp;over the flanges is being gradually increased. While this is going on,&nbsp;the fibres of the flange^ are being strained, because the rolls run&nbsp;at a higher speed at their peripheries than next the body. The&nbsp;metal is being violently thrust and drawn in different ways, so that&nbsp;while economy has to be studied by reducing the number of passes,&nbsp;as much as possible, undue stress must be avoided by making the&nbsp;reductions as easy as is practicable. These things cannot be put&nbsp;into a formula, but the roll-turners work by experience and empirical rules gathered by long practice. In order to avoid these deep&nbsp;groovings, and also severe lateral thrusts on the rolls, angle sections&nbsp;are always rolled with the slope of the flanges approximately&nbsp;equalized; so too are zeds (fig. 1, No. 32). The reduction is then&nbsp;effected with the minimum of stress to the metal. Variations are&nbsp;readily made in the thicknesses of rolled sections without changing&nbsp;the rolls, by simply varying the distance between their centres.&nbsp;This is effected by the adjustment of the top roll (fig. 5). Differences in thickness are made in ^gths of an inch, up to a maximum of&nbsp;about î in. Another detail of design in closed passes is so to shape&nbsp;the rolls as to make any pass obliterate the fin produced in the&nbsp;previous groove. Sometimes sections are turned over to effect this,&nbsp;but often the bodies of the rolls are turned of suitable diameters&nbsp;to produce the result. Guards are required to prevent the bars&nbsp;from becoming wrapped round the rolls (“ collaring ”). With&nbsp;the same object the upper roll is always made larger in diameter&nbsp;than the lower, lts speed is therefore slightly greater than that&nbsp;of the lower one. This stretches the plate or bar very slightly&nbsp;on the upper side, and so imparts a downward movement to it&nbsp;towards the floor, which is what is required. The difference in&nbsp;diameter varies with circumstances, ranging from ^th to about I in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Besides the standard types of mills noticed, the two-high and three-high, there are special mills. The merchant mill simply&nbsp;denotes either one of the above types used for the production of&nbsp;flat bars. The continuous mills are special designs for rolling&nbsp;small rods to be drawn into wire. In these there are several pairs&nbsp;of rolls placed in series, so that the billet is rolled from one stand to&nbsp;others in succession without re-heating. There are a number of&nbsp;different designs, one of which is the Belgian looping mill, so called&nbsp;because the rod is bent backward and forward in the form of the&nbsp;letter S in its passage through adjacent sets of rolls. In another&nbsp;design a flying shear is employed, which automatically cuts off&nbsp;billets from the bar while the latter is travelling at the rate of&nbsp;6 or 8 ft. per second.^&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(J. G. H.)</span></p>
