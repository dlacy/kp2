 an acid extracted from amber by ſublimation in a gentle heat, and riſes in a concrete form into the neck of the ſubliming veſſel. The operation muſt not be puſhed too far, or by too ſtrong a fire, otherwise the oil of the amber riſes along with the acid. The ſalt is dried upon blotting paper, and purified by repeated ſolution and cryſtallization.</p><p>The acid is ſoluble in 24 times its weight of cold water, and in a much ſmaller quantity of hot water. It poſſeſſes the qualities of an acid in a very ſmall degree, and only affects the blue vegetable colours very lightly. The affinities of this acid with the ſalifiable baſes were determined by Mr de Morveau, who is the firſt chemiſt that has endeavoured to aſcertain them.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
