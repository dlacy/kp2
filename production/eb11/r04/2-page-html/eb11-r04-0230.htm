<p><span class="font2">ROSKILDE, or </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roeskilde,</span><span class="font2"> a town of Denmark in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">amt </span><span class="font2">(county) of Kjobenhavn (Copenhagen), 20 m. by . rail W. of&nbsp;Copenhagen, on the great lagoon-like inlet riamed Roskilde&nbsp;Fjord. Pop. (1901) 8368. It has a small port, and is an&nbsp;important railway junction, from which lines diverge W.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">S.W. and S. through the island of Zealand. Its interest, however, is historical. It was the capital of the kingdom&nbsp;until 1443, and the residence of the bishops of Zealand until&nbsp;the Reformation. The cathedral, a beautiful church, was consecrated in 1084, but of this early building only foundation&nbsp;walls remain; the present structure of brick was begun </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">1215, and enlarged and restored at various later dates. It&nbsp;stands in relation to Danish history somewhat as Westminster&nbsp;Abbey does to English, containing the tombs of most of the&nbsp;Danish kings from Harold I. (987). The most noteworthy&nbsp;architectural details are the Chapel of the Trinity (15th century)&nbsp;and that of Christian IV. (Renaissance, 1617), carved choir-stalls, and an altar-piece of the 16th century. Other old buildings are a church of Our Lady, dating as it stands from 1242,&nbsp;a diocesan library (partly of the 15th century), royal palace&nbsp;(1733) and institute for daughters of noblemen (1670).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSMEAD, HERCULES GEORGE ROBERT ROBINSON, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ist Baron</span><span class="font2"> (1824-1897), British colonial administrator, was born&nbsp;on the 19th of December 1824. He was of Irish descent on&nbsp;both sides; his father was Admiral Hercules Robinson, his&nbsp;mother a Miss Wood of Rosmead, County Westmeath, from&nbsp;which he afterwards took his title. Passing from Sandhurst&nbsp;into the 87th Foot, he attained the rank of captain; but in&nbsp;1846, through the influence of Lord Naas, he obtained a post&nbsp;in the Board of Public Works in Ireland, and subsequently&nbsp;became chief commissioner of fairs and markets. His energy&nbsp;in these positions, notably during the famine of 1848, and the&nbsp;clearness and vigour of his reports, secured for him at the&nbsp;age of thirty the office of president of the island of Montserrat.&nbsp;Subsequently he was governor of St Christopher, from 1855 to&nbsp;1859, when he was knighted in recognition of his services in&nbsp;introducing coolie labour into the island; of Hong-Kong; of&nbsp;Ceylon (K.C.M.G. in 1869); and in 1872 of New South Wales.&nbsp;It fell to his lot to annex the Fiji Islands to the British Empire,&nbsp;and his services were rewarded in 1875 by promotion to G.C.M.G.&nbsp;In 1879 he was transferred to New Zealand, and in 1880 he&nbsp;succeeded Sir Bartle Frere as high commissioner of South&nbsp;Africa. He arrived in South Africa shortly before the disaster&nbsp;of Majuba, and was one of the commissioners for negotiating&nbsp;a peace which was personally distasteful to him. It left him&nbsp;with the task of conciliating on the one hand a Dutch party&nbsp;elated with victory, and on the other hand a British party&nbsp;almost ready to despair of the British connexion. He was&nbsp;called home in 1883 to advise the government on the terms of&nbsp;the new convention concluded with the Transvaal Boers in&nbsp;February 1884. On his return to South Africa he found that&nbsp;a critical situation had arisen in Bechuanaland, where Boer&nbsp;commandoes had seized large tracts of territory and proclaimed&nbsp;the “republics” of Stella and Goshen. They refused to retire&nbsp;within the limits of the Transvaal as defined by the new convention, and Robinson, alive to the necessity of preserving this&nbsp;country—the main road to the north—for Great Britain, determined on vigorous action. John Mackenzie and later Cecil&nbsp;Rhodes were sent to secure the peaceful submission of the&nbsp;Boers, but without immediate result, partly owing to the attitude of the Cape ministry. Robinson’s declaration that the&nbsp;advice of his ministers to patch up a settlement with the filibustering Boers was equivalent to a condonation of crime, led&nbsp;to the expedition of Sir Charles Warren and the annexation&nbsp;of Bechuanaland early in 1885. The difficulties of Robinson’s&nbsp;position were illustrated by the dispute which arose between&nbsp;him and Warren, who declared that the high commissioner’s&nbsp;duties to the home government were at times in conflict with&nbsp;the action which, as governor of Cape Colony, he was bound to&nbsp;take on the advice of his ministers in the interests of the colony.&nbsp;Sir Hercules Robinson succeeded in winning the confidence of&nbsp;President Kruger by his fair-mindedness, while he seconded</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rhodes’s efforts to unite the British and Dutch parties in Cape Colony. His mind, however, was that of the administrator as&nbsp;distinguished from the statesman, and he was content to settle&nbsp;difficulties as they arose. In 1886 he investigated the charges&nbsp;brought against Sir John Pope-Hennessy, governor of Mauritius,&nbsp;and decreed his suspension pending the decision of the home&nbsp;authorities, who eventually reinstated Pope-Hennessy. In&nbsp;1887 Robinson was induced by Rhodes to give his consent&nbsp;to the conclusion of a treaty with Lobengula which secured&nbsp;British rights in Matabele and Mashona lands. In May 1889&nbsp;Robinson retired. In his farewell speech he declared that there&nbsp;was no permanent place in South Africa for direct Imperial&nbsp;rule. This was interpreted to mean that South Africa must&nbsp;ultimately become independent—an idea repugnant to him.&nbsp;He explained in a letter to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Times</span><span class="font2"> in 1895 that he had&nbsp;referred to the “ direct rule of Downing Street over the crown&nbsp;colonies, as contrasted with responsible colonial government.”&nbsp;He was made a baronet in 1891. Early in 1895, when he had&nbsp;entered his 71st year and was not in robust health, he yielded&nbsp;to the entreaties of Lord Rosebery’s cabinet, and went out&nbsp;again to South Africa, in succession to Sir H. Loch. His second&nbsp;term of office was not fortunate. The Jameson Raid produced&nbsp;a permanent estrangement between him and Cecil Rhodes, and he&nbsp;was out of sympathy with the new colonial secretary, Mr Chamberlain, who had criticized his appointment, and now desired&nbsp;Robinson to take this opportunity of settling the whole question&nbsp;of the position of the Uitlanders in the Transvaal. Robinson&nbsp;answered that the moment was inopportune, and that he must&nbsp;be left to choose his own time. Alarmed at the imminent&nbsp;danger of war, he confined his efforts to inducing the Johannes-burgers to lay down their arms on condition that the raiders’&nbsp;lives were spared, not knowing that these terms had already&nbsp;been granted to Jameson. He came home to confer with the&nbsp;government, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Rosmead.&nbsp;He returned to South Africa later in the year, but was compelled&nbsp;by ill-health, in April 1897, to quit his post, and died in London&nbsp;on the 28th of October 1897, being succeeded in the title by&nbsp;his son.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSMINI-SERBATI, ANTONIO (1797-1855), Italian philosopher, was born at Rovereto in Italian Tirol on the 25th of March 1797. He belonged to a noble and wealthy family, but&nbsp;at an early age decided to enter the priesthood. After studying&nbsp;at Pavia and Padua, he took orders in 1821. In 1828 he founded&nbsp;a new religious order, the Institute of the Brethren of Charity,&nbsp;known in Italy generally as the Rosminians. The members&nbsp;might be priests or laymen, who devoted themselves to preaching, the education of youth, and works of charity—material,&nbsp;moral and intellectual. They have branches in Italy, England,&nbsp;Ireland, France and America. In London they are attached&nbsp;to the church of St Etheldreda, Ely Place, Holborn, where the&nbsp;English translation of Rosmini’s works is edited. His works,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Five Wounds of the Holy Church</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Constitution of&nbsp;Social Justice,</span><span class="font2"> aroused great opposition, especially among the&nbsp;Jesuits, and in 1849 they were placed upon the Index. Rosmini&nbsp;at once declared his submission and retired to Stresa on Lago&nbsp;Maggiore, where he died on the ist of July 1855. Before his&nbsp;death he had the satisfaction of learning that the works in&nbsp;question were dismissed, that is, proclaimed free from censure&nbsp;by the Congregation of the Index. Twenty years later, the&nbsp;word “ dismissed ” </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(dimittantur)</span><span class="font2"> became the subject of controversy, some maintaining that it amounted to a direct&nbsp;approval, others that it was purely negative and did not imply&nbsp;that the books were free from error. The controversy continued&nbsp;till 1887, when Leo XIII. finally condemned forty of his propositions and forbade their being taught.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In 1848 Rosmini Hook part in the struggle which had for its object emancipation from Austria, but he was not an initiator&nbsp;of the movement which ended in the freedom and unity of&nbsp;Italy. In fact, while eager for the deliverance of Italy from&nbsp;i^ustria, his aim was to bring about a confederation of the&nbsp;states of the country, which was to be under </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">the </span><span class="font2">control of&nbsp;the pope.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
