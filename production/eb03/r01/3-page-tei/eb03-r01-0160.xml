The gods themſelves and the fouls of men were in this fyſtem only modifications of matter (f). Man was compoſed of their four elements, Fire, Air, water, and Earth ; and upon diffolution, every part returned to the element from which it had come, as the water of a veffel ſwimming in the ſea unites with the ocean when the veffel is broken. This fyftem, it is plain, cannct poſſibly admit of any ſeparate confciouſneſs of exiſtence (c). The ſame may be foid of the ſyſtems of Deιnocrates and Epicurus, and all thoſe who undertook to explain things upon physical principles (∏)∙ The chief merit of the phyfical ſyſtems appears to be this : Abſurd as they were, it would ſeem from the whimſical and the almoſt childiſh reafoning of Lucretius, that they had a tendency to lead mankind ſrom extravagant hypotheſes to ſomething that was ſimilar to obſervation.</p><p>what Ariſtotle thought of the ſeparate exiſtence of the ſoul after death is not very certain. The ſoul lie calls an Ev7sλe^s∣α ; and if the reader can divine the meaning of the word, he perhaps can divine the meaning of the <hi rend="italic">Stagy rite,</hi>  and will then be a better diviner than we. At other times he fays, that the ſoul is ſomething divine ; that it reſembles the element of the ſtars; that it is ſomething of a fiery nature ; that it is the vicegerent ¢ff God in the body ; and that the acuteneſs of the ſenſes, the powers of the intellect, with the various kinds of appetites, and paſſions, depend entirely on the qualities of the blood (ι),</p><p>Another opinion of very old date was that of the late ingenious Mr Hunter. According to him, the living principle reſides in the blood. This opinion, which is mentioned by Moſes, was adopted by Critias and others of the ancients. Harvey likewiſe embraced it. But Mr Hunter, who always wiſned to be thought an original, inclines to ſtand at the head of the opinion, and ſupports. it by experiments ſimilar to thoſe of the famed Taliacotius in mending noſes. Should any of our readers wiſti to extract the foul’s immortality from ſuch an opinion, we muſt refer them to the many reſources of ingenuity, ſophiſtry, and logic.</p><p>Among the Jews, the belief of a future and feparate exiſtence for a long time was deemed no effential article of their creed. Some thought that the foul was a ſpark in the moving cf the heart ; ſome imagined that it was the breath, and that upon the diffolution of the body it naturally vaniſhed into ſoft air. The Sadducees denied the exiftence of either angel or lpirit. Many be-lieved the doctrine of ghoſts, and were accuſtomed to invoke them at the grave. It is hence that we hear the prophets complaining that they were leeking from the living God unto dead men. Some imagined that there was a pre-exiſttnce of ſouls; and, in the caſe of a blind man, aſked our Saviour, whether the man or his parents had finned that he was born blind ? others, inclined to a revolution, of ſoul and body, and thought that our Saviour was either Elias or one of the old prophets returned ; and a great many new-modelled; their opinion of the foul’s immortality according to certain paffages in Scripture. The inſpired mother of Samuel had ſaid, " The Lordki!leth and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the grave, and bringeth up.” Iſaiah had exclaimed, " Thy dead ſhall live; together with my dead body ſhall they arife : Awake, and ſing, ye that dwell in the dull ; for thy dew is as the dew of herbs,, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead.” Daniel had de-clared<hi rend="sup">l</hi>, that many of them that ſleep in the duſt of the<hi rend="sup">ι </hi>earth ſhall awake to everlaſting life, and ſome to ſharn¢ and everlaſting contempt. In the viſion of the valley, of dry bones, Ezekiel had ſeen that " at the word of the Lord” the bones came together, bone to his bone, the ſinews and the fleſh came upon them, and the ſkin covered them above, and the breath came into the bodies, and they lived, and ſtood upon their feet. And a. paffage of Job led them to ſuppoſe, that at ſome diſtant and future period a particular time, which wap called<hi rend="italic">the lajl</hi>  or the <hi rend="italic">Litter day,</hi>  was appointed by heaven for the general refuιτection of all thoſe who are ſleeping in their graves. “ I know ( ſays Job) my Redeemer liveth, and that he ſhall ſtand at the latter day upon the earth; and though after my ſkin worms deſtroy this body, yet in my fleſh ſhall' I fee God.”</p><p>whether theſe paflages were fairly interpreted agree-· ably to their true and original meaning, it is not here our buſineſs to inquire. It is ſuffieient for us to ob-ſerve, that from them many of the Jews inferred the reality of a general reſurrection (κ). In this perſua-ſion, Martha, ſpeaking of her brother Lazarus, ſays to our Lord, " I know that he ſhall riſe again in the re-ſurrection at the laſt day.” This reſurrection appears</p><p>( κ) The of the Stoics appears to be the ſame with the <hi rend="italic">IÀ</hi>  of the Chinefo∖</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(g) Yet without regarding the inconſiſtency, many of the Stoics believed, that the foul continued ſeparate· long after death ; though all in general ſeemed to deny a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">( h ) In his </hi><hi rend="italic">Phyfical Coſmogony,</hi>  Plato differed but little from the Stoics ; but he had a∩otlrer fort of coſmogony, in which all things appear to have ſprung from, and to be almoſt wholly compofed of, metaphyſical entities, as ideas of forms, numbers, and mathematical figures. Theſe kinds of notions were common both to him and Py-thagoras ; and were originally borrowed ſrom Egypt, where calculation and geometry were half deified.
