Theſe ſtipulations were punctually fulfilled by Malcolm, who built in the neighbourhood a chapel dedicated to Olaus, the tutelar ſaint of theſe northern nations.</p><p>After all theſe glorious exploits, and becoming the ſecond legiſlator in the Scottiſh nation, Malcolm is ſaid to have ſtained the latter part of his reign with avarice and oppreſſion; in conſequence of which he was murdered at the age of 80 years, after he had reigned above 30. This aſſaſſination was perpetrated when he was on his way to Glamis. His own domeſtics are ſaid to have been privy to the murder, and to have fled along with the conſpirators; but in paſſing the lake of Forfar on the ice, it gave way with them, and they were all drowned, their bodies being diſcovered ſome days after. The latter part of thia account is confirmed by the ſculptures upon ſome ſtones erected near the ſpot; one of which is ſtill called <hi rend="italic">Malcolm's grave-ſtone;</hi> and all of them exhibit ſome rude repreſentations of the murder and the fate of the aſſaſſins.</p><p>Malcolm was ſucceeded, in the year 1034, by his grandſon Duncan I. but he is ſaid to have had another grandſon, the famous Macbeth; though ſome are of opinion that Macbeth was not the grandſon of Malcolm, but of Fenella who murdered Kenneth III. The firſt years of Duncan’s reign were paſſed in tranquillity, but domeſtic broils ſoon took place on the following occaſion. Banquo, thane of Lochaber, and anceſtor to the royal family of Stuart, acted then in the capacity of ſteward to Duncan, by collecting his rents; but being very rigid in the execution of his office, he was way-laid, robbed, and almoſt murdered. Of this outrage Banquo complained as ſoon as he recovered of his wounds and could appear at court. The robbers were ſummoned to ſurrender themſelves to juſtice; but inſtead of obeying, they killed the meſſenger. Macbeth repreſented this in ſuch ſtrong terms, that he was ſent with an army to reduce the inſurgents, who had already deſtroyed many of the king’s friends. This commiſſion he performed with ſuch lucceſs, that the rebel chief put an end to his own life; after which Macbeth ſent his head to the king, and then proceeded with the utmoſt ſeverity againſt the inſurgents, who were compoſed of Iriſhmen, Iſlanders, and Highlanders.</p><p>This inſurrection was ſcarcely quelled, when the Danes landed again in Fife; and Duncan put himſelf at the head of an army, having the thanes Macbeth and Banquo ſerving under him. The Danes were commanded by Sweyn king of Norway, and eldeſt ſon of Canute. He proceeded with all the barbarity natural to his nation, putting to death men, women, and children who fell in his way. A battle was fought between the two nations near Culroſs, in which the Septs were defeated: but the Danes purchaſed their victory ſo dearly, that they could not improve it; and Duncan retreated to Perth, while Macbeth was ſent to raiſe more forces. In the mean time Sweyn laid ſiege to Perth, which was defended by Duncan and Banquo. The Danes were ſo much diſtreſſed for want of proviſions, that they at laſt conſented to treat of a peace, provided the preſſing neceſſities of the army were relieved. The Scots hiſtorians inform us, that this treaty was ſet on foot in order to amuſe Sweyn, and gain time for the</p><p>ſtratagem which Duncan was preparing. This was no other than a barbarous contrivance of infuſing intoxicating herbs into the liquors that were ſent along with the other proviſions to the Daniſh camp. Theſe ſoporifics had their intended effect; and while the Danes were under their influence, Macbeth and Banquo broke into their camp, where they put all to the ſword, and it was with difficulty that ſome of Sweyn’s attendants carried him on board; and we are told that his was the only ſhip of all the fleet that returned to Norway. It was not long, however, before a freſh body of Danes landed at Kinghorn in the county of Fife: but they were entirely defeated by Macbeth and Banquo. Such of the Danes as eſcaped fled to their ſhips; but before they departed they obtained leave to bury their dead in Inchcolm, a ſmall iſland lying in the Forth, where one of their monuments is ſtill to be ſeen.</p><p>Thus ended the formidable invaſions of the Danes; after which Duncan applied himſelf to the adminiſtration of juſtice, and the reformation of the manners of his ſubjects. Macbeth, however, who had obtained great reputation by his ſucceſs againſt the Danes, began to form ambitious deſigns, and to aſpire to the crown itſelf. The fables relating to his uſurpation are ſo well known from the tragedy compoſed by Shakeſpeare which bears the name of <hi rend="italic">Macbeth,</hi> that we ſhall not take notice of them here; but only obſerve, that at laſt Duncan, not knowing he had ſo dangerous an enemy near his perſon, whoſe ſchemes required to be watched, was murdered at Inverneſs by Macbeth, who ſucceeded him in the throne.</p><p>During the greateſt part of the reign of the uſurper, Malcolm, the true heir to the crown of Scotland, kept cloſe in his principality of Cumberland, without any thoughts of aſcending his father’s throne. Macbeth for ſome time governed with moderation, but at laſt became a tyrant. Becoming jealous of Banquo, the moſt powerful ſubject in his dominions, he invited him to an entertainment, and cauſed him to be treacherouſly murdered. His ſon Fleance was deſtined to the ſame fate, but eſcaped to Wales. After him Macduff, the thane of Fife, was the moſt powerful perſon in Scotland; for which reaſon, Macbeth determined to deſtroy him. On this Macduff fled to France; and Macbeth cruelly put to death his wife, and children who were yet infants, and ſequeſtered his eſtate. Macduff vowed revenge, and encouraged Malcolm to attempt to dethrone the tyrant. Macbeth oppoſed them with his whole force; but being defeated in a pitched battle, he took refuge in the moſt inacceſſible places of the Highlands, where he defended himſelf for two years; but in the mean time Malcolm was acknowledged king of Scotland, and crowned at Scone.</p><p>The war between Macbeth and the new king continued for two years after the coronation of the latter; but at laſt he was killed in a ſally by Macduff. However the public tranquillity did not end with his life. His followers elected one of his kinſmen named <hi rend="italic">Lullach, </hi>ſurnamed the <hi rend="italic">Idiot,</hi> to ſucceed him: but he not being able to withſtand Malcolm, withdrew to the north, where being purſued, he was killed at Elſey in Strathbogie, after a reign of four months.</p><p>Malcolm being now eſtablilhed on the throne, began with rewarding Macduff for his great ſervices; and conferred upon his family four extraordinary privileges,</p></body></text></TEI>
