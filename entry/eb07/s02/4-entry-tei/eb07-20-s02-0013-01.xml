are pipes of lead inserted in openings bored from the deck through the sides of a ship, to carry the water off from the deck to the sea. To avoid the inconvenience of having the scuppers broken by the working of the ship, each is formed of two pipes, one of which is passed upwards to the deck through the opening in the ship’s side, and having its lower end nailed on the outside planking ; the other, which is of smaller diameter, after being woold- ed on the outside with flannel dipped in tallow, is passed downwards into the lower pipe, through the opening in the deck, and its upper end secured on the plank of the deck. In order to prevent the entrance of water by these scuppers when a ship is inclined, valves of metal are placed over the external outer ends, which close with the pressure of the external water. In merchant-vessels, leather-pipes, called scupper-hoses, are sometimes nailed round the opening for the same purpose. Sometimes scuppers are only leaden pipes passed through the ship’s side, and turned and fastened at each end.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
