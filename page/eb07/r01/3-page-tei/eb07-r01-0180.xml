And, lastly, we may conclude, that there will be something opposite to pressure, or something which we may call <hi rend="italic">abstraction,</hi>  exerted on the posterior part of the body which moves in a tenacious fluid, or is exposed to the stream of such a fluid ; for the stagnant fluid adheres to the posterior surface, and the passing fluid tends to draw it away both by its tenacity and by its friction. This must augment the apparent impulse of the stream on such a body ; and it must greatly augment the resistance, that is, the motion lost by this body in its progress through the tenacious fluid ; for the body must drag along with it this stagnant fluid, and drag it in opposition to the tenacity and friction of the surrounding fluid. The effect of this is most remarkably seen in the resistances to the motion of pendulums ; and the Chevalier du Buat, in his examination of Newton's experiments, clearly shows that this constitutes the greatest part of the resistance.</p><p>We cannot conclude this dissertation better, than by giving an account of some experiments of the Chevalier du Buat, which seem of immense consequence, and tend to give us entirely new views of the subject. Du Buat observed the motion of water issuing from a glass cylinder through a narrow ring formed by a bottom of smaller diameter ; that is, the cylinder was open at both ends, and there was placed at its lower end a circle of smaller diameter, by way of bottom, which left a ring all around. He threw some pow<hi rend="sup">r</hi>dered sealing-wax into the water, and observed with great attention the motion of its small particles. He saw those which happened to be in the very axis of the cylinder descend along the axis with a motion pretty uniform, till they came very near the bottom ; from this they continued to descend very slowΙy, till they were almost in contact with the bottom ; they then deviated from the centre, and approached the orifice in straight lines and with an accelerated motion, and at last darted into the orifice with great rapidity. He had observed a thing similar to this in a horizontal canal, in which he had set up a small board like a dam or bar, over which the water flow-ed. He had thrown a gooseberry into the water, in order to measure the velocity at the bottom, the gooseberry being a small matter heavier than water. It approached the dam uniformly till about three inches from it. Here it almost stood still, but it continued to advance till almost in contact. It then rose from the bottom along the inside of the dam with an accelerated motion, and quickly escaped over the top.</p><p>Hence he concluded that the water which covers the anterior part of the body exposed to the stream is not perfectly stagnant, and that the filaments recede from the axis in curves, which converge to the surface of the body as different hyperbolas converge to the same assymptote, and that they move with a velocity continually increasing till they escape round the sides of the body.</p><p>He had established a proposition concerning the pressure which water in motion exerts on the surface along which it glides, viz. <hi rend="italic">that the pressure is equal to that which it would exert if at rest,</hi>  minus <hi rend="italic">the weight of the column whose height would produce the velocity </hi><hi rend="italic">of </hi><hi rend="italic">the passing stream. </hi>Consequently the pressure which the stream exerts on the surface perpendicularly exposed to it will depend on the velocity with which it glides along it, and will diminish from the centre to the circumference. This, says he, may be the reason why the impulse on a plane wholly immersed is but one half of that on a plane which deflects the whole stream.</p><p>He contrived a very ingenious instrument for examining this theory. A square brass plate ABGF (fig. 13) was pierced with a great number of holes, and fixed in the front of a shallow box HK, represented edgewise. The back of this box was pierced with a hole C, in which was</p><p>inserted the tube of glass CDE, bent</p><p>square at D. This instrument was ex</p><p>posed to a stream of water, which beat</p><p>on the brass plate. The water having</p><p>filled the box through the holes, stood</p><p>at an equal height in the glass tube when</p><p>the surrounding water was stagnant ; but</p><p>when it was in motion it always stood in</p><p>the tube above the level of the smooth</p><p>water without, and thus indicated the</p><p>pressure occasioned by the action of the</p><p>stream.</p><p>When the instrument was not wholly immersed, there was always a considerable accumulation against the front of the box, and a depression behind it. The water before it was by no means stagnant ; indeed it should not be, as Du Buat observes ; for it consists of the water which was escaping on all sides, and therefore upwards from the axis of the stream, which meets the plate perpendicularly in C considerably under the surface. It escapes upw ards ; and if the body w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>ere sufficiently immersed, it would escape in this direction almost as easily as laterally. But in the present circumstances it heaps up, till the elevation occasions it to fall off sidewise as fast as it is renewed. When the instrument was immersed more than its semi-diameter under the surface, the water still rose above the level, and there was a great depression immediately behind this elevation. In consequence of this difficulty of escaping upwards, the water flows off laterally ; and if the horizontal dimensions of the surface are great, this lateral efflux becomes more difficult, and requires a greater accumulation. From this it happens, that the resistance of broad surfaces equally immersed is greater than in the proportion of the breadth. A plane of two feet wide and one foot deep, when it is not completely immersed, will be more resisted than a plane two feet deep and one foot wide ; for there will be an accumulation against both ; and even if these were equal in height, the additional surface will be greatest in the widest body ; and the elevation will be greater, because the lateral escape is more difficult.</p><p>The circumstances chiefly to be attended to are these. The pressure on the centre was much greater than towards the border, and, in general, the height of the water in the tube DE was more than 4/3 of the height necessary for producing the velocity when only the centre hole was open. When various holes were opened at different distances from the centre, the height of the water in DE continually diminished as the hole was nearer the border. At a certain distance from the border the water at E was level with the surrounding water, so that no pressure was exerted on that hole. But the most unexpected and remarkable circumstance was, that in great velocities, the holes at the very border, and even to a small distance from it, not only sustained no pressure, but even gave out water ; for the water in the tube was lower than the surrounding water. Du Buat calls this a <hi rend="italic">non-pressure.</hi>  In a case in which the velocity of the stream was three feet, and the pressure on the central hole caused the water in the vertical tube to stand 33 lines or 33/12 of an inch above the level of the surrounding smooth water, the action on a hole at the lower corner of the square caused it to stand 12 lines lower than the surrounding water. Now the velocity of the stream in this experiment was 36 inches per second. This requires 2l¼ lines for its productive fall, whereas the pressure on the central hole was 33. This approaches to the pressure on a surface which deflects it wholly. The intermediate holes gave every variation of pressure, and the diminution was more rapid as the holes were nearer the edge ; but the law of diminution could not be observed.</p><p>This is quite a new and most unexpected circumstance in the action of fluids on solid bodies, and renders the sub-</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
