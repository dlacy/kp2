<p><span class="font0">neglected. Augustus caused an official survey of the empire to be made, and a scientific census of its resources was gradually&nbsp;carried out and from time to time revised; thus the balance&nbsp;of revenue and expenditure could be accurately estimated and&nbsp;adjusted, and financial stability was established. The system&nbsp;of tax-farming was gradually abolished and direct collection&nbsp;substituted; commerce was freed from vexatious restrictions,&nbsp;and large customs-districts were formed, on whose borders&nbsp;duties were levied for revenue only. The government took&nbsp;even more direct measures for the encouragement of industry&nbsp;and especially of agriculture. The most remarkable of these&nbsp;were the “ alimentary ” institutions, originally due to Nerva&nbsp;and developed by succeeding emperors. Capital was advanced&nbsp;at moderate rates of interest to Italian landowners on the&nbsp;security of their estates, and the profits of this system of land-banks were devoted to the maintenance and education of poor&nbsp;children. The foundation of colonies for time-expired soldiers,&nbsp;who received grants of land on their discharge, contributed&nbsp;something to the formation of a well-to-do agricultural class;&nbsp;and although the system was not successful in lower Italy,&nbsp;where economic decline could not be arrested, there can be&nbsp;no doubt that central and northern Italy, where the vine and&nbsp;olive were largely cultivated, and manufacturing industries&nbsp;sprang up, enjoyed a considerable measure of prosperity. The&nbsp;extension of the Roman municipal system to the provinces,&nbsp;and the watchful care exercised by the imperial government&nbsp;over the communities, together with the profuse liberality of&nbsp;the emperors, which was imitated by the wealthier citizens of&nbsp;the towns, led to the creation of a flourishing municipal life still&nbsp;evidenced by the remains which in districts such as Asia Minor&nbsp;or Tunis stand in significant contrast with the desolation&nbsp;brought about by centuries of barbaric rule. Mommsen@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>has, indeed, expressed the opinion that “ if an angel of the Lord&nbsp;were to strike the balance whether the domain ruled by Severus&nbsp;Antoninus were governed with the greater intelligence and the&nbsp;greater humanity at that time or in the present day, whether&nbsp;civilization and national prosperity generally had since that&nbsp;time advanced or retrograded, it is very doubtful whether the&nbsp;decision would prove in favour of the present/’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But there is another side to the picture. The empire brought into being a new society and a new nationality, due to the&nbsp;fusion of Roman ideas with Hellenic culture, beside which&nbsp;other elements, saving only, as we shall see, those contributed&nbsp;by the Oriental religions, were insignificant. This new nationality grew in definition through the gradual disappearance of&nbsp;distinctions of language and manners, the assimilating influence&nbsp;of commercial and social intercourse, and the extinction of&nbsp;national jealousies and aspirations. But the cosmopolitan&nbsp;society thus formed was compacted of so many disparate&nbsp;elements that a common patriotism was hard to foster, and&nbsp;doubly hard when the autocratic system of government prevented men from aspiring to that true political distinction&nbsp;which is attainable only in a self-governing community. It&nbsp;is true that there was much good work to be done, and&nbsp;that much good work was done, in the service of the&nbsp;emperors; true, also, that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">carrière ouverte aux talents</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;in large measure realized. Distinctions of race were slowly&nbsp;but steadily effaced by the grant of citizen rights to provincials&nbsp;and by the manumission of slaves; and the career open to&nbsp;the Romanized provincial or the liberated slave might culminate&nbsp;in the highest distinctions which the emperor could bestow.&nbsp;In the hierarchy of social orders—senate, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">equites</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs—&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">ascent was easy and regular from the lower grade to the higher;&nbsp;and the more enlightened of the emperors—especially Hadrian-made a genuine endeavour to give a due share in the work of&nbsp;government to the various subject races. But nothing could&nbsp;compensate for the lack of self-determination, and although&nbsp;during the first century and a half of imperial rule a flourishing&nbsp;local patriotism in some degree filled the place of the wider&nbsp;sentiment, this gradually sank into decay and became a pretext&nbsp;under cover of which the lower classes in the several communities</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">took toll of their wealthier fellow-citizens in the shape of public works, largesses, amusements, &amp;c., until the resources at the&nbsp;disposal of the rich ran dry, the communities themselves in&nbsp;many cases became insolvent, and the inexorable claims of the&nbsp;central government were satisfied only by the surrender of&nbsp;financial control to an imperial commissioner. Then the organs&nbsp;of civic life became atrophied, political interest died out, and&nbsp;the whole burden of administration, as well as that of defence,&nbsp;fell upon the shoulders of the bureaucracy, which proved unequal&nbsp;to the task.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In a world thus governed the individual was thrown more and more upon his own resources—the pursuit of wealth@@<sup>2</sup> and&nbsp;pleasure, or the satisfaction of intellectual interests. Under&nbsp;the rule of the Caesars much was done for education. Julius&nbsp;Caesar bestowed Roman citizenship on “ teachers of the liberal&nbsp;arts ”; Vespasian endowed professorships of Greek and Latin&nbsp;oratory at Rome;@@<sup>3</sup> and later emperors, especially Antoninus&nbsp;Pius, extended the same benefits to the provinces. Local&nbsp;enterprise and munificence were also devoted to the cause of&nbsp;education; we learn from the correspondence of the younger&nbsp;Pliny that public schools were founded in the towns of northern&nbsp;Italy. But though there was a wide diffusion of knowledge&nbsp;under the empire, there was no true intellectual progress.&nbsp;Augustus, it is true, gathered about him the most brilliant&nbsp;writers of his time, and the debut of the new monarchy coincided&nbsp;with the Golden Age of Roman literature; but this was of brief&nbsp;duration, and the beginning of the Christian era saw the triumph&nbsp;of classicism and the first steps in the decline which awaits all&nbsp;literary movements which look to the pasj rather than the&nbsp;future. Political oratory could not exist under an absolute&nbsp;ruler; public life furnished no inspiring theme to poet or&nbsp;historian; and literature became didactic or imitative, while&nbsp;rhetoric degenerated into declamation. It is true that for&nbsp;some time both literature and philosophy maintained an alliance&nbsp;with the old republican aristocracy and voiced the undercurrent&nbsp;of opposition to the empire; but both had ceased to be irreconcilable before the time of Hadrian. Under his rule classicism&nbsp;gave way to the archaism of which Fronto and Apuleius furnish&nbsp;the most notable examples, and which preferred Cato and&nbsp;Ennius to Cicero and Virgil. But this return to the past was&nbsp;not followed by any renewed creative energy. It was a confession of weakness and little more; and the widely diffused&nbsp;culture of the Antonine period, though outwardly brilliant, had&nbsp;no progressive energy and presented but a feeble resistance to&nbsp;the dissolving forces of barbarism.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To strike the balance of loss and gain in the field, of morals is an exceedingly difficult task. The denunciations of the&nbsp;satirists, especially of Juvenal, might lead us to believe that an&nbsp;appalling state of depravity existed in the society of the early&nbsp;empire; but satirists notoriously paint in glaring colours&nbsp;for literary effect, and whatever may be said of the morality&nbsp;of Rome—which was probably no better and no worse than&nbsp;that of any cosmopolitan capital—there were sound and&nbsp;healthy elements in plenty amongst the population of Italy&nbsp;and the provinces. Doubtless the craving for amusement—&nbsp;especially for the shows of the amphitheatre and the chariot-races of the circus—infected the idle masses of the populace&nbsp;in Rome and the larger towns, and was fostered by the policy&nbsp;of despotism, which always aims at securing cheap popularity&nbsp;with the proletariat; but the tendency of the time, not only in&nbsp;the higher ranks, but also amongst humbler folk, was towards&nbsp;a broader humanity and a more serious view of life and its&nbsp;problems. Greek philosophy, especially the Stoic system,&nbsp;in order to appeal to the practical Roman intelligence, found&nbsp;itself obliged to elaborate a rule of conduct, and in many</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
