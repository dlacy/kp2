<p><span class="font1">For Roman portraits J.

<p><span class="font1">ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH, the name generally given to that great branch of the Christian Church which acknowledges the pope, or bishop of Rome, as its head, and holds as&nbsp;an article of faith that communion with and submission to&nbsp;the authority of the see of Rome is essential to effective&nbsp;membership of the Catholic Church as founded by Christ.&nbsp;This helief is based upon the commission given by Christ to&nbsp;Peter as “ prince of the apostles,” “ Feed my sheep ”&nbsp;(John xxi. 15-17); the saying, “ Thou art Peter, and upon this&nbsp;rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not&nbsp;prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the&nbsp;kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth&nbsp;shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on&nbsp;earth shall be loosed in heaven ” (Matt. xvi. 18, 19). The&nbsp;authority thus conferred upon St Peter is,, held by Roman&nbsp;Catholics </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to </span><span class="font1">be permanently vested in the bishop of Rome,&nbsp;as successor to Peter, first bishop of the imperial see. As&nbsp;such, the pope is regarded as “ vicar of Christ, head of the&nbsp;bishops, and supreme governor of the whole Catholic Church,&nbsp;of whom the whole world is the territory or diocese.” His&nbsp;peculiar powers as pope he exercises immediately on election.&nbsp;Thus he may grant indulgences, issue censures, give dispensations, , canonize saints, institute bishops, create cardinals—in&nbsp;short, perform all the acts of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jurisdiction,</span><span class="font1"> even though he&nbsp;be no more than a layman; but by custom certain of his&nbsp;more solemn acts are postponed till after the ceremony of his&nbsp;coronation, from which his pontificate is officially dated.&nbsp;To exercise the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actus ordinis</span><span class="font1"> of a priest or bishop, however,&nbsp;he must, if not already in orders, be specially ordained and&nbsp;consecrated. Hence his office is a dignity, not of order, but&nbsp;of jurisdiction (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Papacy</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Pope).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The most distinctive characteristic of the Roman Catholic Church, at least as contrasted with the various Protestant&nbsp;communions, is its vigorous insistence on the principle of&nbsp;ecclesiastical authority. Of this authority the pope is regarded&nbsp;as the centre and source, so far as the interpretation of the&nbsp;Divine Will to the world is concerned in matters of faith and&nbsp;morals. His pronouncements are held to he infallible when</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">he defines a doctrine concerning faith or morals </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ex cathedra </span><span class="font1">to be held by the universal church (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Infallibility</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Vatican Council).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The government of the Roman Catholic Church being centred at Rome, an elaborate organization has been developed&nbsp;there for the administration of its affairs. At the head of this&nbsp;is the college of cardinals, who are the princes and senators&nbsp;of the Church, the counsellors of the pope, and his vicars in&nbsp;the functions of the pontificate. By those of them who are&nbsp;members of the various Congregations and other offices of the&nbsp;Curia the greater part of the government of the Church is&nbsp;directed. (For accounts of the organization of the ^Roman&nbsp;Curia the reader is referred to the articles </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Cardinal</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Curia&nbsp;Romana.)</span><span class="font1"> The characteristic note of the Roman Curia is its&nbsp;intense conservatism and its slowness to move, whether in&nbsp;approving or condemning new developments of opinion or&nbsp;action. This is explained by the nature of its organization&nbsp;and by the tradition on which it is based. For, just as the&nbsp;Roman Church as a whole preserves in the spiritual sphere&nbsp;the spirit and much of the organization of the Roman Empire,&nbsp;so the administration of the Curia carries on the tradition of&nbsp;Roman government, with its reverence for precedent and&nbsp;its practice of deciding questions, not on their supposed&nbsp;abstract merits, but in accordance with the rules of law as&nbsp;defined in the codes or by previous decisions. Thus the genius&nbsp;of Rome remains, as it always has been, administrative rather&nbsp;than speculative. The great dogmas of the Christian Church&nbsp;were shaped by the interplay of the subtle wits of the theologians&nbsp;of the Oriental Churches. The new dogmas promulgated by&nbsp;the Holy See from time to time have heen the outcome of&nbsp;the slow growth of ages, built up from precedent to precedent,&nbsp;and only defined at last when the accumulated weight of&nbsp;evidence in their favour, or the necessity for precise definition&nbsp;to meet the contradictions of heretics, seemed to demand a&nbsp;decision. This temper and the process in which it finds&nbsp;expression are well illustrated in the case of the dogma of the&nbsp;Immaculate Conception (ç.v.) and in the authorization given&nbsp;to the cult of the Sacred Heart (ç.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This conservative spirit and extreme reverence for authority pervades the whole Roman Catholic Church in exact proportion&nbsp;to the degree of effective control which the see of Rome has&nbsp;succeeded in obtaining over its branches in various countries.&nbsp;To pretend to an independent judgment in questions of faith or&nbsp;morals is for a Roman Catholic to commit treason against his&nbsp;Church; and even in the wide sphere of questions lying beyond&nbsp;the dogmas defined as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de fide</span><span class="font1"> a too curious discussion is discouraged, if not condemned. As opposed to the critical and&nbsp;analytical tendencies of the modern world, then, the Roman&nbsp;Catholic Church assumes the function of the champion of moral&nbsp;and intellectual discipline, an attitude defined, in its extrcmcst&nbsp;expression, by Pius IX.’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Syllabus</span><span class="font1"> of 1864 (see </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Syllabus),</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the famous encyclical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pascendi</span><span class="font1"> of Pius X. in 1907. The development of this attitude, known—in so far as it depends on&nbsp;the full pretensions of the Papacy—as Ultramontanism<sub>i</sub> since&nbsp;. the definition of the Roman Catholic Church by the council of&nbsp;Trent in 1564, will be found sketched ill the historical section&nbsp;attached to this article. The earlier history, which is that of&nbsp;the Latin Church of the West, will be found in the articles&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Papacy, Church History</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Reformation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Under the supreme authority of the pope the Roman Catholic Church is governed and served by an elaborate hierarchy. This,&nbsp;so far as its </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestates ordinis</span><span class="font1"> are concerned, is divided into seven&nbsp;orders: the three “ major orders ” of bishops and priests,&nbsp;deacons, and subdeacons (bishops and priests forming two&nbsp;degrees of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ordo sacerdotiurn),</span><span class="font1"> and the four “minor orders ”&nbsp;of acolytes, exorcists, readers, and door-keepers. These various&nbsp;orders do not derive their </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">potestas ordinis</span><span class="font1"> from the pope, but&nbsp;fro God, in virtue of their direct ministerial succession from the&nbsp;apostles.@@So far as jurisdiction is concerned, however, those</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> Thus sacraments administered by validly ordained or consecrated priests and bishops are regarded as valid, even when those , who administer them are heretics or schismatics.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
