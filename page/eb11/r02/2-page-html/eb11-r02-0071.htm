<p><span class="font1">The word “ represent ” comes from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">re-praesentare,</span><span class="font1"> to « make present again,” or “ bring back into presence,” and its&nbsp;<sub>wQrd</sub> history in English may be traced fairly well by the&nbsp;<sup>e w</sup>° * * citations given in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">New English Dictionary</span><span class="font1"> of its&nbsp;earliest uses in literature in senses which are still common. Thus&nbsp;we find the verb meaning (1380) simply to “ bring into presence,”&nbsp;and Barbour uses it (1375) in the sense of bringing clearly&nbsp;before the mind, whence the common sense of “ explain,”&nbsp;“exhibit,” “portray.” In 1513 it is used as synonymous&nbsp;with “ describe,” or “ allege to be.” In 1460 we find it employed for the performance of a play or a part in a play, whence&nbsp;comes the sense of symbolizing, standing in the place of&nbsp;some one, or corresponding to something; and in 1655 for&nbsp;acting as authorized agent or deputy of some one. This is a&nbsp;notable point in the development of the word. In Cromwell’s&nbsp;speech to the parliament, January 22, 1655, he says: “ I have&nbsp;been careful of your safety, and the safety of those you represented.” This strictly political use of the verb developed, it</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">will be seen, comparatively late.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The noun “ representation ” passed through similar stages. In 1425 we find it equivalent to “ image,” “ likeness,” “ reproduction,” “ picture,” from which is derived a meaning hardly&nbsp;distinguishable from “pretence.” In 1553 it means a “statement ” or “ account,” a sense which leads later (1679) to that of&nbsp;a formal and serious plea or remonstrance. In 1589 it occurs for&nbsp;a performance of a play. In 1647 it is used in psychology for&nbsp;the action of mental reproduction, a technical sense which&nbsp;applies especially to the “ immediate object of imagination ”&nbsp;(Sir W. Hamilton), and in Kantian language becomes the&nbsp;generic term for percepts, concepts and ideas. In 1624 it comes&nbsp;to mean “ substitution of one thing or person for another,”&nbsp;“ substituted presence ” as opposed to “ actual presence,” or&nbsp;“ the fact of standing for, or in place of, some other thing or&nbsp;person,” especially with a right or authority to act on their&nbsp;account. Its application to a political assembly then becomes&nbsp;natural, but for some time it is not so found in literature, the&nbsp;sense remaining rather formal. Good instances of this use&nbsp;are:, Gataker, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">TransubsL</span><span class="font1"> 4:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ The Rocke was Christ onely</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">symbolically and sacramentally, by representation or resemblance and R. Coke, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Power and Subf.</span><span class="font1"> iii.: “ So cannot these members be formed into one body but by the king, either&nbsp;by his Royal Presence or representation.” Thus “ presence ”&nbsp;and “ representation ” are used in distinctive meanings. In&nbsp;Scots law (1693) it obtains the technical meaning of the assumption by an heir of his predecessor’s rights and obligations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The term “ representative,” now specially applied to an elected member of a national or other assembly, deriving his&nbsp;authority from the constituency which returns him, appears&nbsp;to have been first used to denote not the member but the&nbsp;assembly itself. In the act abolishing the office of king, after&nbsp;Charles I.’s execution, 1649, section iv. runs: “ And whereas&nbsp;by the abolition of the kingly office provided for in this Act,&nbsp;a most happy way is made for this nation (if God see it good)&nbsp;to return to its just and ancient right of being governed by its&nbsp;own Representatives or national meetings in council, from time&nbsp;to time chosen and entrusted for that purpose by the people,&nbsp;it is therefore resolved and declared by the Commons assembled&nbsp;in Parliament,” &amp;c., “ and that they will carefully provide for&nbsp;the certain choosing, meeting and sitting of the next and&nbsp;future Representatives,” &amp;c. But the application of the term&nbsp;to the persons who sat in parliament was at all events very soon&nbsp;made, for in 1651 Isaac Penington the younger published a&nbsp;pamphlet entitled “ The fundamental right, safety and liberty&nbsp;of the People; which is radically in themselves, derivatively&nbsp;in the Parliament, their substitutes or representatives.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is worth while to dwell on the historical evolution of the various meanings of “ represent,” “ representation ” and&nbsp;“ representative,” because it is at least curious that it was not&nbsp;till the 17th century that the modern political or parliamentary&nbsp;sense became attached to them; and it is well to remember&nbsp;that though the idea of political representation is older and thus&nbsp;afterwards is expressed by the later meaning of the word, the&nbsp;actual use of “ representation ” in such a sense is as modern as&nbsp;that. In Burke’s speeches of 1769@@<sup>1</sup> and 1774-1775, relating&nbsp;to taxation, we find the word in this sense already in common&nbsp;use, but the familiar modern doctrine of “ no taxation without&nbsp;representation,” however far back the idea may be traced, is&nbsp;not to be found in Burke in those very words. The “ originator&nbsp;of that immortal dogma of our </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(i.e.</span><span class="font1"> American) national greatness ”&nbsp;was, according to the American writer M. C. Tyler </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Amer. Lit.</span><span class="font1"> i.&nbsp;154), the politician and philanthropist Daniel Gookin (1612-1687),&nbsp;an Irish settler in Virginia, who, moving to Boston and becoming&nbsp;speaker of the Massachusetts legislature, became prominent in&nbsp;standing up for popular rights in the agitation which resulted&nbsp;in the withdrawal of the colonial charter (1686). But it was&nbsp;the vogue of the “ dogma ” in America, not its phrase, that&nbsp;he seems to have originated; and while the precise form of the&nbsp;phrase does not appear to be attributable to any single author,&nbsp;the principle itself was asserted in England long before the&nbsp;word “ representation,” in a political sense, was current. In&nbsp;English constitutional history the principle was substantially&nbsp;established in 1297 by the declaration </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">De Tallagio non concedendo,</span><span class="font1">@@<sup>2</sup></span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"> &nbsp;</span><span class="font1">confirmed by the Petition of Right in 1628.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The growth of the parliamentary system in England is traced in the article Parliament, but the account there given may&nbsp;be supplemented here by a more precise reference to&nbsp;the evolution of the idea of political “ representation ” as such, and of its embodiment in the word now&nbsp;employed to express it. The simple idea of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">substitution</span><span class="font1"> of one person for another, in some connexion, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> hostage,&nbsp;pledge, victim, is so old as to be only describable as primitive;&nbsp;it is found in the proxy system, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> in marriage, and in diplomacy, the legate or ambassador being the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">alter ego</span><span class="font1"> of his&nbsp;sovereign; but, so far as general political legislative action,&nbsp;by one man in an assembly on behalf of others, is concerned,&nbsp;no systematic employment of a “ deputy ” (the word still used&nbsp;both in a general sense and in politics as a synonym for “representative ”) is known among the ancients. So long as political&nbsp;power rests in a small privileged class, such an idea must be&nbsp;slow to develop; and the primitive notion of a law-making&nbsp;body is that of all the members present in person, as in ancient&nbsp;Greece. But, as Stubbs </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Const. Hist.</span><span class="font1"> i. 586) points out, the early&nbsp;English jury system (see Jury) shows the germ of the true idea&nbsp;of representation in England; it was the established practice&nbsp;of electing or selecting juries to present criminal matters before&nbsp;the king’s judges, and assessors to levy taxes on the county,&nbsp;that suggested the introduction of popular representation in&nbsp;the English political system, and thus brought “ the commons ”&nbsp;into play in addition to the Crown and the nobles. Under&nbsp;Henry III., in 1254, we have the writ (see Parliament) requiring the sheriff of each county to “ cause to come@@<sup>3</sup> before the&nbsp;King’s Council two good and discreet Knights of the Shire,&nbsp;whom the men of the county shall have chosen for this purpose&nbsp;in the stead of all and of each of them, to consider along with&nbsp;knights of other shires what aid they will grant the king.” But&nbsp;the definite establishment of the principle of political representation, in a shape from which the later English system of representation lineally descended, may be traced rather to the year&nbsp;1295, in Edward L’s famous writ of summons to parliament,&nbsp;of which the following is the important part. In the volume&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Select Documents of English Constitutional History</span><span class="font1"> (1901),&nbsp;selected by G. B. Adams and H. M. Stephens, whose version from&nbsp;the Latin we quote, the section is headed (ante-dating the use&nbsp;of the vital word), “ Summons of representatives of the counties&nbsp;and horoughs ”:—</span></p>
