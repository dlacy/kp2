            <p>tries, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Poland, and Muſcovy. Each of the ſecretaries has an
                apartment in all the royal houſes, both for their own accommodation and their
                officers; they have alſo a table at the king’s charge, or elfe board-wages. The two
                ſecretaries for Britain have each two under ſecretaries, and one chief clerk; with
                an uncertain number of other clerks and tranſlators, all wholly depending on them.
                To the ſecretaries of ſtate belong the cuſtody of that ſeal properly called the
                ſignet, and the direction of two other offices, one called the <hi rend="italic"
                    >paper-office,</hi> and the other the <hi rend="italic">ſignet office. </hi>In
                addition to theſe, there is at preſent (1795) a ſecretary for the war department,
                whoſe office muſt be temporary. 2. Secretary of an embaſſy, a perſon attending an
                ambaſſador, for writing diſpatches relating to the negociation. There is a great
                difference between the ſecretary of an embaſſy and the ambaſſador’s ſecretary; the
                laſt being a domeſtic or menial of the ambaſſador, and the firſt a fervant or
                miniſter of the prince. 3. The ſecretary of war, an officer of the war-office, who
                has two chief clerks under him, the laſt of which is the ſecretary’s meſſenger.
                There are alſo ſecretaries in moſt of the other offices.</p>
            <p>SECRETION, in the animal œconomy. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Physiology,</hi> ſect.
                VI.</p>
            <p>SECT, a collective term, comprehending all ſuch as follow the doctrines and opinions
                of ſome famous divine, philoſopher, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>SECTION, in general, denotes a part of a divided thing, or the diviſion itſelf. Such,
                particularly, are the ſubdiviſions of a chapter; called alſo <hi rend="italic"
                    >paragraphs </hi>and <hi rend="italic">articles:</hi> the mark of a ſection is
                §.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Section,</hi> in geometry, denotes a ſide or ſurface of a body
                or figure cut off by another; or the place where lines, planes, &amp;c. cut each
                other.</p>
            <p>SECTOR, in geometry, is a part of a circle comprehended between two radii and the
                arch; or it is a mixed triangle, formed by two radii and the arch of a circle.</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sector,</hi> is alſo a mathematical inſtrument, of great uſe in
                finding the proportion between quantities of the ſame kind: as between lines and
                lines, ſurfaces and ſurfaces, &amp;c. whence the French call it the <hi
                    rend="italic">compaſs of proportion.</hi> The great advantage of the ſector
                above the common ſcales, &amp;c. is, that it is made ſo as to fit all radii and all
                ſcales. By the lines of chords, ſines, &amp;c. on the ſector, we have lines of
                chords, ſines, &amp;c. to any radius betwixt the length and breadth of the lector
                when open.</p>
            <p>The real inventor of this valuable inſtrument is unknown; yet of ſo much merit has
                the invention appeared, that it was claimed by Galileo, and diſputed by nations.</p>
            <p>The ſector is founded on the fourth propoſition of the ſixth book of Euclid; where it
                is demonſtrated, that ſimilar triangles have their homologous ſides proportional. An
                idea of the theory of its conſtruction may be conceived thus. Let the lines AB, AC
                (Plate CCCCXLVIII. fig. 5.) repreſent the legs of the ſector; and AD, AE, two equal
                lections from the centre: if, now the points CB and DE be connected, the lines CB
                and DE will be parallel; therefore the triangles ADE, ACB will be ſimilar; and
                conſequently the ſides AD, DE, AB, and BC, proportional; that is, as AD: DE: AB: BC:
                whence, if AD be the half, third, or fourth part of AB; DE will be a half, third, or
                fourth part of CB: and the ſame holds of all the reſt. If, therefore, AD be the
                chord, ſine, or tangent, of any number of degrees to the radius AB; DE will be the
                ſame to the radius BC.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">Deſcription of the Sector.</hi> The inſtrument conſiſts of two
                rulers or legs, of braſs or ivory, or any other matter, repreſenting the radii,
                moveable round an axis or joint, the middle of which expreſſes the centre; whence
                are drawn on the faces of the rulers ſeveral ſcales, which may be diſtinguiſhed into
                ſingle and double.</p>
            <p>The double ſcales, or lines graduated upon the faces of the inſtrument, and which are
                to be uſed as ſectoral lines, proceed from the centre; and are, 1. Two ſcales of
                equal parts, one on each leg, marked <hi rend="smallcaps">lin.</hi> or <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">l.</hi> each of theſe ſeales, from the great extenſiveneſs of
                its uſe, is called the <hi rend="italic">line oſ lines. 2.</hi> Two lines of chords
                marked c<hi rend="smallcaps">ho.</hi> or c. 3. Two lines of ſecants marked <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">sec. </hi>or s. A line of polygons marked <hi rend="smallcaps"
                    >pol.</hi> Upon the other face the ſectoral lines are, 1. Two lines of lines
                marked <hi rend="smallcaps">sin.</hi> or s. 2. Two lines of tangents marked <hi
                    rend="smallcaps">tan.</hi> or T. 3. Between the line of tangents and ſines there
                is another line of tangents to a leſſer radius, to ſupply the defect of the former,
                and extending from 45⁰to 75⁰, marked t.</p>
            <p>Each pair of theſe lines (except the line of polygons) is ſo adjuſted as to make
                equal angles at the centre; and conſequently at whatever diſtance the ſector be
                opened, the angles will be always reſpectively equal. That is, the diſtance between
                10 and 10 on the line of lines, will be equal to 60 and 60 on the line of chords, 90
                and 90 on the line of ſines, and 45 and 45 on the line of tangents.</p>
            <p>Beſides the ſectoral ſcales, there are others on each face, placed parallel to the
                outward edges, and uſed as thoſe oſ the common plane ſcale. I. Theſe are a line of
                inches. 2. A line of latitudes. 3. A line of hours. 4. A line of inclination of
                meridians. 5. A line of chords. Three logarithmic ſcales, namely, one oſ numbers,
                one of ſines, and one of tangents; theſe are uſed when the ſector is fully opened,
                the legs forming one line @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p>
            <p>The value of the diviſions on moſt of the lines are determined by the figures
                adjacent to them; theſe proceed by tens, which conſtitute the diviſions of the firſt
                order, and are numbered accordingly; but the value of the diviſions on the line of
                lines, that are diſtinguiſhed by figures, is entirely arbitrary, and may repreſent
                any value that is given to them; hence the figures 1, 2, 3, 4, &amp;c. may denote
                either 10, 20, 30, 40, or 100, 200, 300, 400, and ſo on.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italic">The line oſ lines</hi> is divided into ten equal parts, numbered 1,
                2, 3, to 10; theſe may be called d<hi rend="italic">ivisions of the first
                    order;</hi> each of theſe are again ſubdivided into 10 other equal parts, which
                may be called <hi rend="italic">diviſions oſ the second order;</hi> each of theſe is
                divided into two equal parts, forming <hi rend="italic">diviſions oſ the third
                    order.</hi> The diviſions on all the ſcales are contained between four parallel
                lines;</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a)</hi> The lines are placed in different orders on
                different lectors, but they may eaſily be found by theſe general directions.</p>
