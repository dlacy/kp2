To the latter, in consideration of its importance, was assigned the second place of precedence.Duke Leopold III. of Austria viewed the extending confederation with jealousy and alarm, and various quarrels having taken place between him and the cantons, hostilities were at length commenced. The duke, with a numerous force, chiefly composed of cavalry, marched rapidly towards the interior of the country, and on the 9th of July 1386 encountered the Swiss in the neighbourhood of Sempech. The battle was long and fiercely contested, but at length the Swiss patriots gained a complete victory ; the duke himself was slain, and more than 600 of the higher and lower nobility, with about 2000 of their less distinguished adherents, were left dead on the field.Two years after the battle of Sempech, the Austrians stormed Naefels, a small town in the canton of Glaris. The garrison retreated from the town as far as Mount Rute, where they took up a strong position, and awaited the approach of the enemy. The Austrians maintained the fight for some time with great ardour, but were in the end overthrown and put to flight. The bridge of Weser was broken down by the weight of the fugitives, and above 3000 common soldiers, and 183 knights, were slain in the battle, or drowned in the lake and in the river. These defeats induced Duke Leopold IV. to enter into a truce with the cantons for seven years, during which the Swiss contrived by various means to extend their territory and to increase their power.With the exception of the disputes which took place between the people of the canton Appenzell, and of the Valais and Rhætian Alps, with their lords, and of the civil war which arose between Zürich and Schwytz relative to the right to some lands, no event of much importance occurred in the history of Switzerland till the year 1474, when Louis XI. of France induced the Swiss to make a diversion in his favour, by falling on the territory of Charles the Bold, duke of Burgundy, who had advanced to the very walls of Paris, and threatened Louis with the loss of his throne. This unprovoked attack induced the duke to offer terms of peace to the king of France, and the emperor of Germany, with whom he was at the same time at war ; and these monarchs accepted his offer, leaving their late allies to meet his whole vengeance as they best might. Peace was no sooner concluded, than Charles determined to inflict condign punishment on them for their unjustifiable aggression, and in the spring of 1476 crossed the Jura with an army of sixty thousand men. He encountered thc army of the confederates near the town of Grandson, and after a desperate conflict was totally defeated with the loss of a thousand men. His camp, with an immense booty, fell into the hands of the Swiss. A few months after, he was defeated, with prodigious slaughter, in a second action, near the little town of Morat ; and two years later, when the duke was slain in the battle of Nancy, the Burgundians paid the confederates the sum of 150,000 florins to make peace with them.These repeated victories procured for the Swiss the reputation of being the best soldiers in Europe ; and a considerable number of them were hired to fight the battles of foreigners. The sudden wealth acquired by plunder and pensions excited its possessors to profusion and extravagance ; their morals became corrupted, and the simple republican spirit almost disappeared. A spirit of cupidity and pride displayed itself among the rulers, and dissipation and love of plunder among the people ; and the Swiss became notorious throughout Europe as the hirelings of any potentate who had battles to fight and gold to squander. Domestic troubles and feuds generally prevailed ; the peace and security of the country were disturbed to such a degree by an armed and desperate banditti of disbanded soldiers and idle vagabonds, that in 1480, during the short</p><p>of the emperor Henry I. surnamed the Fowler. An immense horde of barbarians, known by the name of Hungarians, issued from the east and the shores of the Black Sea, and overran Italy and Germany, burning and destroying wherever they came. In order to protect the inhabitants from the fury of these ruthless invaders, Henry built walls around a number of defensible places, to which all, in case of need, might fly for the security of their lives and property. In this manner Zurich, St Gall, Basel, and various other places, rose from petty hamlets to towns of considerable strength and numerous population. About the same period the bailifs of the emperor built and fortified Berne, Freyburg, and various other towns. A ninth of the free and nobler class of inhabitants were required to occupy these national fortresses, and they received the same political organization and rights as the more ancient cities of Germany. This was the first foundation of the class of burghers, who in process of time came to be a third estate in the kingdom. In proportion as the wealth and importance of the towns augmented, thc citizens were eager to extend their rights and privileges. They availed themselves of every opportunity to purchase their emancipation from the feudal dominion of the bishops, abbots, and monasteries, to whose authority they had long been subjected ; and in a short time the burghers were able to bid defiance to the nobles, and even to balance the political weight of the clergy.</p><p>The affairs of Switzerland continued in this state without any material alteration until the year 1290, when Rudolp of Hapsburg, whose castle was situated in the canton of the Aar, and who, besides possessing manorial rights and great influence in Schwytz, had held the office of imperial bailif of several towns, was elected emperor of Germany. This prince, though inhabiting a distant country, continued throughout his life to be strongly attached to Switzerland. He conferred new honours on its nobles, and granted additional privileges to its towns, or confirmed those which they already enjoyed. Rudolp was succeeded by his son Albert, whose ambition and rapacity soon alienated the affections of both his German and his Swiss subjects. Two of the imperial bailifs, Herman Gessler and Berin- guer of Landenberg, who were appointed over the Waldstätten (the three cantons of Schwytz, Unterwalden, and Uri), subjected the inhabitants to every species of insolence and oppression. Gessler, in particular, was guilty of so many acts of wanton cruelty that he was at length put to deatli by the famous William Tell, w ho thus paved the way for the deliverance of his countrymen. Three patriots, whose names are still revered throughout the republic, Werner from the canton of Schwytz, Walter Hurst from Uri, and Arnold from Unterwalden, formed a conspiracy against the Austrian governors ; and their measures were concerted with such wisdom, and executed with so much courage and intrepidity, that they obtained possession of every fortress of any considerable strength or importance. The three cantons formerly mentioned having thus achieved their independence, held a meeting on the 7th of January 1315, and laid the foundation of the Swiss confederation. Shortly after this revolt of the forest cantons, the emperor Albert was murdered by his nephew and some other nobles; but his son Duke Leopold marched against the cantons with a powerful army. The Schwytzers waited his arrival at Morgarten, on the slope of the mountain Sattel, and, notwithstanding the disparity of their forces, routed the Austrians with great slaughter ; and it was with no small difficulty that the duke himself escaped, leaving most of his officers and an immense number of his soldiers dead upon the field.</p><p>In 1332 the inhabitants of Lucerne formed a perpetual league with the Waldstätten ; and in 1351 the citizens of Zürich, having thrown off the yoke of the aristocracy, joined the Swiss republic, and on account of the power and wealth of the town it was promoted to the chief rank.
