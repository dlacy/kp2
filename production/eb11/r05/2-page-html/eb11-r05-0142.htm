<p><span class="font0">before the 19th century, that is to say, industries carried on with capital and machinery in large factories, lndustry of this character&nbsp;was first established in Poland in 1820, and it has grown there&nbsp;rapidly, though never so rapidly as during the last few years of the&nbsp;19th century. The principal centre is Lodz in the government of&nbsp;Piotrkow, the staple industry being cottons. A good many factories&nbsp;have sprung up also in Warsaw and at Sosnowice and Bcndzin in&nbsp;the extreme S.W. corner of Poland. Besides cottons the products&nbsp;include woollens and cloth, silks, chemicals, machinery, ironware,&nbsp;beer and flour. At Lodz alone the workmen, in great part Germans&nbsp;and Jews, number between 50,000 and 60,000, and the total output&nbsp;of the factories is estimated at £9,000,000 to £10,500,000 annually.&nbsp;Similar industries, carried on by similar methods, exist at St Petersburg, Riga, Narva and Odessa. In S. Russia, more particularly at&nbsp;Ekaterinoslav, a very vigorous metallurgical industry has grown up&nbsp;since i860 in conjunction with the iron and coal mining.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The peculiar feature of Russian industry is the development out of the domestic petty handicrafts of central Russia of. a semifactory on a large scale. Owing to the forced abstention from&nbsp;agricultural labour in the winter months the peasants of central&nbsp;Russia, more especially those of the governments of Moscow,&nbsp;Vladimir, Yaroslavl, Kostroma, Tver, Smolensk and Ryazan have&nbsp;for centuries carried on a variety of domestic handicrafts during the&nbsp;period of compulsory leisure. The usual practice was for the whole&nbsp;of the people in one village to devote themselves to one special&nbsp;occupation. Thus, while one village would produce nothing but&nbsp;felt shoes, another would carve sacred images </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(fkons),</span><span class="font0"> and a third&nbsp;spin flax only, a fourth make wooden spoons, a fifth nails, a sixth&nbsp;iron chains, and so on. In the same way certain governments&nbsp;become famous for certain commodities, as Moscow for osier&nbsp;baskets, flower baskets, wicker furniture and lace; Kostroma for&nbsp;lace, wooden utensils, toys, wooden spoons, cups and bowls, bast&nbsp;sacks and mats, bast boots and garden products; Yaroslavl for&nbsp;furniture, brass samovars, saucepans, spurs, rings, &amp;c.; Vladimir&nbsp;for furniture, osier baskets and flower-stands and sickles; Nizhniy-Novgorod for bast mats and sacks, knives, forks and scissors; Tver&nbsp;for lace, nails, sieves, anchors, fish-hooks, locks, coarse clay pottery,&nbsp;saddlery and harness, boots and shoes, and so on. Out of these&nbsp;have grown large factories, employing as many as 10,000 to 12,000&nbsp;men each; but when harvest comes round,. these men leave the&nbsp;factories and repair to their fields, and meantime the factories stand&nbsp;still for two or three months. Nor do the people work on the&nbsp;holidays of the church, the number of days they lose in this way&nbsp;amounting to nearly one-third of the whole year. Hence, although&nbsp;wages are painfully low, the cost of production to the manufacturer&nbsp;is relatively high ; and it is still further increased by the cost of the&nbsp;raw materials, by the heavy rates of transport owing to the distance&nbsp;from the sea, by the dearness of capital and by the scarcity of fuel.&nbsp;As a consequence this central Russian industry, even when supported by very high protective duties, is only able to produce for&nbsp;the home market and the markets of the adjacent territories in&nbsp;Asia which are under Russian political control. Here again cotton&nbsp;is the principal product; and the remarkable growth of the industry&nbsp;is illustrated by the fact that, whereas in 1843 there were only&nbsp;350,000 spindles at work, fifty years later there were 4,332,000 so&nbsp;employed, and in 1900, 6,554, boo. The number of looms increased&nbsp;from 87,190 in 1890 to 154,600 in 1900. Next after cottons come&nbsp;woollens, silk, cloth, chemicals, machinery, paper, furniture, hats,&nbsp;cement, leather, glass and china and other products. From the&nbsp;governments of Vyatka and Vladimir large numbers of bricklayers,&nbsp;carpenters and other handicraftsmen migrate temporarily to the&nbsp;S. governments every year, and similarly plasterers and painters&nbsp;from the government of Moscow.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">With regard to Russian industry generally, the extravagant prices which have to be paid for iron and all iron goods, owing&nbsp;to the prohibitive tariffs, combined with the obstacles put in the&nbsp;way of education, hamper the development of all industries. The&nbsp;cotton factories excel chiefly in the production of red and printed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">cottons. In the flax-mills the tendency is to produce the finest tissues as well as the coarser. The silk-mills employ silk obtained&nbsp;from the Caucasus, Italy and France. The growth of the sugar ·&nbsp;industry is shown by the fact that in 1888-93 the average&nbsp;annual production of sugar was 444,520 tons, in 1902-3 it was&nbsp;1,180,293 tons. Since 1894 the government has had a monopoly&nbsp;in retailing spirituous liquors, but not wine or beer; but distilling,&nbsp;a very widespread industry, is left in private hands. Beer is&nbsp;chiefly brewed in Poland and the Baltic provinces. Tanneries&nbsp;exist in nearly every government, but it is especially at Warsaw&nbsp;and St Petersburg, and after these at Moscow, that the largest&nbsp;and best modern tanneries and shoe and glove factories are established. The governments of Orel (shoe factories), Kherson,&nbsp;Vyatka, Nizhnîy-Novçorod, Perm, Kiev and Kazan rank next&nbsp;in this respect. Furniture factories are developing greatly, as is&nbsp;the paper industry. Flour-mills play an important part in the&nbsp;general industry of Russia, and there are several tobacco and&nbsp;hemp factories.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Far from being, destroyed by the competition of the “ modern ” factories, domestic industries have well maintained their ground,&nbsp;new branches of petty trade having, sprung up in some districts,&nbsp;among them the manufacture of agricultural machinery (thrashing&nbsp;machines in Ryazan, Vyatka and Perm; ploughs in Smolensk,&nbsp;&amp;c.) deserves notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The wealth of Russia consisting mainly of raw produce, the trade of the country turns chiefly on the purchase of this for export,&nbsp;and on the sale of manufactured and imported goods&nbsp;in exchange. This traffic is in the hands of a great&nbsp;number of middlemen,—in the W. Jew's, and elsewhere&nbsp;Russians,-—to whom the peasants are.for the most part in debt,&nbsp;as they purchase in advance on security of subsequent payments&nbsp;in corn, tar, wooden wares, &amp;c. A good deal of the internal trade&nbsp;is carried on by travelling merchants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The fairs are very numerous. Those of. Nizhniy-Novgorod, with a return of 20 millions sterling, of Irbit and Kharkov, of&nbsp;Menzelinsk in Ufa, and Omsk and Ishim in Siberia, have considerable importance both for trade and for home manufactures.&nbsp;Altogether, no fewer than 16,600 fairs are held in Russia, 85%&nbsp;of them in European Russia. Of these, 30 show returns of goods&nbsp;imported to the value of over £100,000 each, 41 from £50,000 to&nbsp;£100,000, and 437 from £10,000 to £50,000 each.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">The exports rank in the following order:—cereals (wheat, barley, rye, oats, maize, buckwheat) and flour, 49*2%; timber and wooden&nbsp;wares, 7-2; petroleum, 5-8; eggs, 5-4; flax, 5; butter, 3; sugar,&nbsp;2*4; cottons and oilcake, 2 each; oleaginous seeds, &amp;c., 1-5;&nbsp;with hemp, spirits, poultry, game, bristles, hair, furs, leather,&nbsp;manganese ore, wool, caviare, live-stock, gutta-percha, vegetables&nbsp;and fruit, and tobacco. The two best customers of Russia are&nbsp;Germany, which takes 23-3% of her total exports, and the United&nbsp;Kingdom, which takes 22*9%. Then follow the Netherlands&nbsp;(9*8%), France, Italy, Finland, Belgium, Austria-Hungary, Denmark, Turkey and Sweden. The commodities which the United&nbsp;Kingdom principally takes are wheat, wool, barley, eggs, oats and&nbsp;flax. With regard to the imports into Russia—they consist mainly&nbsp;of raw materials and machinery for the manufactures, and of&nbsp;provisions, the principal items being raw cotton, 17% of the&nbsp;aggregate; machinery and metal goods, 13%; tea, 5%; mineral&nbsp;ores, 5%; gums and resins, </span><span class="font1">4%; </span><span class="font0">wool and woollen yarns, 3|%;&nbsp;textiles, 3%; fish, 3%; wdth leather and hides, chemicals, silks,&nbsp;wine and spirits, colours, fruits, coffee, tobacco and rice. The&nbsp;countries from which Russia buys most extensively are Germany&nbsp;(34%), the United Kingdom (15 1/2) and the United States (9I).&nbsp;Machinery, coal, iron, woollens, ships, lead and copper are the&nbsp;commodities supplied by the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The total mercantile marine of Russia does, not aggregate 700,000. tons; and .it is distributed in the following proportions:&nbsp;35*4% in the Caspian Sea, 34.7% in the Black Sea and&nbsp;Sea of Azov. 24-7% in the Baltic Sea and 5-2% in the White Sea. And these proportions represent fairly well the&nbsp;tonnages entering and clearing at the ports of these respective&nbsp;seas. But of the vessels that visit the Russian ports in the way of&nbsp;trade every year only 8-3% are Russian, the rest being of course&nbsp;foreign.
