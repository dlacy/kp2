<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rowley (William), who ſtands in the third claſs of dramatic writers, lived in the reign of king Charles I.&nbsp;and received his education at the univerfity of Cambridge ; but vhether he took any degree there, is not&nbsp;evident ; there being but few particulars preſerved in&nbsp;regard to him more than his cloſe intimacy and connection with all the principal wits and poetical geniuſes of&nbsp;that age, by whom he was well beloved, and with ſome&nbsp;of whom he joined in their writings. Wood ftyles him&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"><sup>tt</sup> the ornament, for wit and ingenuity, of Pembroke-hall in Cambridge.” In a word, he was a very great&nbsp;benefactor to the Engliſh ſtage, having, exclufive of his&nbsp;aid lent to Middleton, Day, Hey wood, Webſter, &amp;c.&nbsp;left us five plays of his own compofing, and one in which&nbsp;even the immortal Shakeſpeare afforded him ſome aſ-ſiſtance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ROXBURGH-shire, or Teviotdale, a county of Scotland, deriving its name from the town of Roxburgh, which is now deſtroyed, and the river Teviot,&nbsp;that runs through the ſhire into the Tweed, is divided&nbsp;into the three diſtricts of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Teviotdale, Liddiβdale,</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eβdale,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Euſdale,</span><span class="font0"> ſo called from their refpective rivers, Teviot, IAddal, and Eſk. It is bounded on the&nbsp;eaſt and ſouth-eaſt by Northumberland and Cumberland, on the ſouth and ſouth-weſt by Annandale, on&nbsp;the weſt by Tweeddale, on the north by the Merſe and&nbsp;Lauderdale; extending about 30 miles from eaſt t© weſt,&nbsp;and about 15 in breadth from the border of England&nbsp;to the Blue Cairn in Lauder-moor. The ſhire exhibits a&nbsp;rough irregular appearance of hills, moffes, and mountains, interſperſed, however, with narrow valleys, and&nbsp;watered with delightful ſtreams. Though the face of&nbsp;the country is bare of woods, the valleys yield plenty&nbsp;of corn, and the hills abound with paſture for ſheep and&nbsp;black cattle. The principal mountains of this country&nbsp;are known by the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cockraw :</span><span class="font0"> from whence a&nbsp;range of very high hills runs weſtward, dividing Scotland from England. On the confines of this ſhire are&nbsp;the debateable lands ; the property of which was formerly diſputed by the Scots and Engliſh borderers, but&nbsp;adjudged to the Scots at the union of the crowns.—&nbsp;Roxburghſhiie yields plenty of lime and freeſtone, which&nbsp;in former times was freely uſed by the inhabitants in&nbsp;building cattles to defend them from the invafions of&nbsp;their Engliſh neighbours. The moſt diſtinguiſhed families in this county are the Scots and Kers, who raiſed&nbsp;themſelves to wealth and honours by their bravery and&nbsp;ſucceſs in a fort of predatory war with their enemies of&nbsp;South Britain. The ſhire is very populous ; and the&nbsp;people are ſtout and valiant. They were formerly inured to military diſeipline and all the dangers of war,&nbsp;by living on dry marches contiguous to thoſe of England ; being ſo numerous and alert, that this and the&nbsp;neighbouring ſhire of Berwick could in 24 hours produce ιo,ooo men on horſeback, well armed and accoutred. In the ſhire of Roxburgh we ſtill meet with&nbsp;a great number of old caſtles and ſeats belonging to&nbsp;private gentlemen, whoſe anceſtors fignalized themſelves</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">in this manner ; and we find the remains of old encampments, and a Roman military way, vulgarly called the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cauſewny,</span><span class="font0"> rιmning from Haunυm to the Tweed. The principal town, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roxburgh,</span><span class="font0"> giving the title of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duke</span><span class="font0"> to the chief of the Kers, was anciently a royal borough, containing divers pariſhes, large and fiouriſhing, defended by a ſtrong citadel, which was often alternately reduced by the Engliſh and Scotch adventurers. It&nbsp;was in befieging this caſtle that James II. of Scotland&nbsp;loſt his life by the burſting of a cannon. In conſequence of the almoſt continual wars between the two.&nbsp;nations, this fortreſs was razed, the town ruined, and&nbsp;its royalty tranflated to Jedburgh, which is now a royal&nbsp;borough, ſituated between the Tefy and Jed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">ROXENT-cape, or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Rock oſLiſbon,</span><span class="font0"> a mountain and remarkable promontory in Portugal, fituated in the Atlantic ocean, at the north entrance of the Tagus, 22&nbsp;miles north of Liſhon.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Roυal Family.</span><span class="font0"> The firſt and moſt conſiderable branch of the king’s royal family, regarded by the laws&nbsp;of England, is the queen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I. The queen of England is either queen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regent,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">queen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conſort,</span><span class="font0"> or queen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dowager.</span><span class="font0"> The queen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">regent,,&nbsp;regnant,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſovereign,</span><span class="font0"> is ſhe who holds the crown in&nbsp;her own right ; as the firſt (and perhaps the ſecond)&nbsp;queen Mary, queen Eliſabeth, and queen Anne ; and&nbsp;ſuch a one has the ſame powers, prerogatives, rights»,&nbsp;dignities, and duties, as if ſhe had been a king. This-is expreſsly declared by ſtatute I Mar. I. ſt. 3. c. I.&nbsp;But the queen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">conſort</span><span class="font0"> is the wife of the reigning king ;&nbsp;and ſhe by virtue of her marriage is participant of divers prerogatives above other women.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And, firſt, ſhe is a public perſon, exempt and diſtinct from the king ; and not, like other married women»,&nbsp;ſo cloſely connected as to have loſt all legal or ſeparate&nbsp;exiſtence ſo long as the marriage continues. For the&nbsp;queen is of ability to purchaſe lands and to convey&nbsp;them, to make leaſes, to grant copyholds, and do other&nbsp;acts of ownerſhip, without the concurrence of her lord ;&nbsp;which no other married woman can do : a privilege as&nbsp;old as the Saxon era. She is alſo capable of taking&nbsp;a grant from the king, which no other wife is from her&nbsp;huſhand ; and in this particular ſhe agrees with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">au-guβa</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">piiſjima regina coηjux divi imperatoris</span><span class="font0"> of the&nbsp;Roman laws ; who, according to Juſtinian, was equally&nbsp;capable of making a grant to, and receiving one from,&nbsp;the emperor. The queen of England hath ſeparate&nbsp;courts and officers diſtinct from the king’s, not only&nbsp;in matters of ceremony, but even of law ; and her attorney and ſolicitor general are entitled to a place&nbsp;within the bar of his majeſty’s courts, together with&nbsp;the king’s counſel. She may likewiſe ſue and be ſued&nbsp;alone, without joining her huſhand. She may alſo have&nbsp;a ſeparate property in goods as well as lands, and ha3&nbsp;a right to diſpoſe of them by will. In ſhort, ſhe is in&nbsp;all legal proceedings looked upon as a feme ſole, and&nbsp;not as a feme covert ; as a fingle, not as a married woman. For which the reaſon given by Sir Edward Cok⅛&nbsp;is this : becauſe the wiſdom of the common law would&nbsp;not have the king (whoſe continual care and ſtudy is&nbsp;for the public, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">circa ardua regpi')</span><span class="font0"> to be troubled&nbsp;and diſquieted on account of his wife’s domeſtic affairs ; and therefore it veſts in the queen a power of&nbsp;tranſacting her own concerns, without, the intervention&nbsp;of the king, as if ſhe vf⅛5 an unmarried woman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The queen hath alſo many exemptions, and minute prerogatives. For inſtance : ſhe pays no toll ; nor is</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
