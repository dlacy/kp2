(Turkish, <hi rend="italic">Scodra</hi>; Slavic, <hi rend="italic">Skadar),</hi> the capital of North Albania, at the south end of the lake of the same name, with a population of 24,500 in 1880 (mostly Mohammedans). There is only one street with any pretensions to regularity. The straggling town is built on the low flat promontory formed by the Bojana, which takes off the waters of the lake to the Adriatic, and the river which flows into the lake after crossing the plain between Scutari and the mountains of Biskassi. In winter the town is often flooded by the Bojana. The mosques and minarets are insignificant ; the handsomest of the churches is the Catholic church at the north-east end. In the background is an old Venetian fortress perched on a lofty rock. The town is favourably situated for commerce, being connected by the Bojana with the Adriatic, whence its boats carry the products which descend by the Drina to the mountaineers in exchange for their wool, grain, and dyeing and building woods. There are some manufactures of arms and of cotton stuffs. In 1884 330 ships of 123,923 tons entered the port and 325 ships of 123,713 tons cleared.</p><p>Livy relates that <hi rend="italic">Scodra</hi> was chosen as capital by the Illyrian king Gentius, who was here besieged in 168 <hi rend="smallcaps">b.c.</hi>, and carried captive to Rome. In the 7th century Scutari fell into the hands of the Servians, from whom it was wrested by the Venetians, and finally, in 1479, the Turks acquired it by treaty. Early in 1885 a beginning was made with the construction of a highway from the roadstead of San Giovanni deâ€™ Medici to Scutari.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
