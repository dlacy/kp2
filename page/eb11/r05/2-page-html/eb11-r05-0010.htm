<p><span class="font0">a salt-tax collectorship. His poem was entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Mots; </span><span class="font0">it appeared in 1779, was praised in MS., damned in print&nbsp;and restored to a just appreciation by the students of literature&nbsp;of the 19th century. It has the drawbacks of merely didactic-descriptive poetry on the great scale, but occasionally displays&nbsp;much grace and spirit. The malicious wit of Rivarol’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mot&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">on the ill-success of the poem, “ C’est le plus beau naufrage du&nbsp;siècle,” is not intelligible unless it is said that one of the most&nbsp;elaborate passages describes a shipwreck. Roucher was a&nbsp;disciple of Voltaire, and therefore a friend of the Revolution,&nbsp;but he remained moderate in his opinions. He frequently&nbsp;presided over an anti-Jacobin club, and denounced the tyranny&nbsp;of the popular demagogues in supplements published with the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Journal de Paris</span><span class="font0"> in 1792. He was arrested on the 4th of&nbsp;October 1793, and, accused of being the leader of a conspiracy&nbsp;among the prisoners at Saint Lazare, was sent to the guillotine&nbsp;on the same tumbril with his friend André Chénier on the&nbsp;23th of July 1794. Roucher translated in 1790 Adam Smith’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wealth of Nations.</span><span class="font0"> His letters from prison were edited by his&nbsp;son-in-law under the title of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Consolations de ma captivité</span><span class="font0"> (1797),&nbsp;and his death was made the subject of a tragedy in 1834 by&nbsp;his brother Claude Roucher-Deratte, a voluminous writer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">See A. Guillois, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Pendant la terreur, la poète Roucher, 1745-1794 </span><span class="font0">(1890), founded on the poet’s papers by one of his descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUÉ, a dissipated debauchee. The word is French, and its original meaning was “ broken on the wheel.” Breaking&nbsp;on the wheel was a form of execution reserved in France, and&nbsp;some other countries, for crimes of peculiar atrocity. A </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">roué,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">therefore, came by a natural process to be understood to mean&nbsp;a man morally worse than a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pendard</span><span class="font0"> or gallows-bird, who&nbsp;only deserved hanging for common crimes. He was also a&nbsp;leader in wickedness, since the chief of a gang of brigands&nbsp;.(for instance) would be broken on the wheel, while his obscure&nbsp;followers were merely hanged. Philip, duke of Orleans, who&nbsp;was regent of France from 1715 to 1723, gave the term the sense&nbsp;of impious and callous debauchee, which it has borne since&nbsp;his time, by habitually applying it to the very bad male company&nbsp;who amused his privacy and his leisure. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">locus classions&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">for the origin of this use of the epithet is in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs</span><span class="font0"> of&nbsp;Saint-Simon (vol. xii. pp. 441-46, ed. Chéruel and Regnier,&nbsp;Paris, 1873-86).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUELLE, GUILLAUME FRANÇOIS (1703-1770), French chemist, was born in 1703 at Mathieu, near Caen. He started&nbsp;as an apothecary, but in 1742 he was appointed experimental&nbsp;demonstrator of chemistry at the Jardin du Roi in Paris,&nbsp;where he was especially influential and popular as a teacher,&nbsp;numbering Lavoisier and J. L. Proust among his pupils.&nbsp;Many stories are told of the vivacity and enthusiasm with&nbsp;which he lectured, of the absent-mindedness which sometimes&nbsp;led him, forgetting that his pupils could not hear what he was&nbsp;saying, to continue his explanations while he was out of the&nbsp;classroom looking for some piece of apparatus, and of the&nbsp;vigorous tirades, generally culminating in the epithet “ plagiaire,” in which he used to indulge against men with whom&nbsp;he disagreed (Hofer, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hist, de la chimie,</span><span class="font0"> ii. 378). His most&nbsp;important achievement was to define “ salts ”—a term formerly&nbsp;used in the most loose and indeterminate way—as the compounds formed by the union of acids and bases, and further&nbsp;to distinguish between neutral, basic and acid salts. Other&nbsp;subjects on which he published papers were the inflammation&nbsp;of turpentine and other essential oils by nitric acid, and the&nbsp;methods of embalmment practised by the Egyptians. He&nbsp;died at Passy on the 3rd of August 1770. He is known as&nbsp;Rouelle the elder, to distinguish him from his younger brother and&nbsp;assistant, Hilaire Marin (1718-1779), who, on his resignation&nbsp;in 1768, succeeded him as demonstrator at the Jardin du Roi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUEN, a city of France, capital of the department of Seine-Inférieure and the ancient capital of the province of Normandy, on the Seine, 87 m. N.W. of Paris by rail. Pop. (1906) 111,402.&nbsp;The old city lies on the north bank of the river in an amphitheatre formed by the hills which border the Seine valley. It&nbsp;is surrounded by boulevards. Outside the ellipse formed by&nbsp;these he the suburbs of Martamville, St Hilaire, Beauvoisine,&nbsp;Bouvreuil and Cauchoise; 2| m. to the east is the industrial&nbsp;town of Darnétal (pop. 6770), and in the level plain on the&nbsp;opposite bank of the Seine is the extensive manufacturing&nbsp;suburb of St Sever with the industrial towns of Sotteville&nbsp;(pop. 18,096) and Petit Quevilly (pop. 14,852) in its immediate&nbsp;neighbourhood. Finally in the centre of the river, north-east&nbsp;of St Sever, is the lie Lacroix, which also forms part of Rouen.&nbsp;Communication across the Seine is maintained by ferry and&nbsp;by three bridges*, including a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pont transbordeur</span><span class="font0">, or moving platform, slung between two lofty columns and propelled by electricity. Rouen possesses four railway stations. The central&nbsp;point of the old town is the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville, occupied&nbsp;by the church of St Ouen, the hôtel de ville and an equestrian&nbsp;statue of Napoleon I., and traversed by the Rue de la République&nbsp;which leads from it past the cathedral to the Place de la République and the Quai de Paris. Parallel to this street to the&nbsp;west are the Rue Beauvoisine with its southern continuations,&nbsp;the Rue des Carmes and the Rue Grand-Pont, and the wide and&nbsp;handsome Rue Jeanne d’Arc terminating on the Quai de la&nbsp;Bourse. These thoroughfares, which are all within the boulevards, are crossed at right angles by the Rue de la Grosse-Horloge and by the Rue Thiers, running from the Place Cauchoise&nbsp;on the west to the Place de l’Hôtel de Ville, and passing on the&nbsp;left the Jardin Solferino and the museum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The cathedral was built on the site of a previous cathedral which was destroyed by fire in 1200, and its construction lasted&nbsp;from the beginning of the 13th century, to which period belong&nbsp;the lateral doors of the west portal, to the beginning of the&nbsp;16th century, when the Tour de Beurre was completed. The&nbsp;spire surmounting the central tower, which is the highest in&nbsp;France (485 ft.), is modern. The western façade, with its&nbsp;profusion of niches, pinnacles and statues, belongs, as a whole,&nbsp;to the Flamboyant style. But the northern tower, the Tour&nbsp;St Romain, is in the main of the 12th century, its upper stage&nbsp;(with its steep, pointed roof) having been added later. The&nbsp;southern tower, the Tour de Beurre, so named because funds&nbsp;for its building were given in return for the permission to eat&nbsp;butter in Lent, is of a type essentially Norman, and consists&nbsp;of a square tower pierced by high mullioned windows and&nbsp;surmounted by a low, octagonal structure, with a balustrade&nbsp;and pinnacles. The juxtaposition of these two towers, so&nbsp;different in character, is the. most striking feature of the main&nbsp;façade, which is notable besides for its width. The portals of&nbsp;the transept are each flanked by two towers and decorated&nbsp;with sculpture and statuary. That to the north, the Portail&nbsp;des Libraires, looks upon the Cour des Libraires, once the resort&nbsp;of the booksellers of Rouen. That to the south is known as&nbsp;the Portail de la Calcnde. The plan of the church comprises&nbsp;a nave with aisles and lateral chapels, a transept and a choir&nbsp;with Ambulatory. The most remarkable part of the interior&nbsp;is the Lady Chapel (1302-20) behind the choir with the tombs&nbsp;(1518-25) of Cardinal Georges d’Amboise and his nephew, the&nbsp;statuary of which, including the kneeling statues of the two&nbsp;cardinals, is of the finest Renaissance workmanship. The chapel&nbsp;also contains the tomb (1536-44) of Louis de Brézé, seneschal of&nbsp;Normandy. Behind the cathedral is the archiépiscopal palace,&nbsp;a building of the 14th and 15th centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">St Ouen, formerly the church of an abbey dating to the Roman period and reorganized by Archbishop St Ouen in the&nbsp;7th century, exceeds the cathedral in length as well as in purity&nbsp;of style. In spite of the juxtaposition of the second and third,&nbsp;the Radiant and Flamboyant types of Gothic architecture,&nbsp;the building, as a whole, presents a unity which even the modem&nbsp;façade has failed to mar. It was founded in 1318 in place of&nbsp;a Romanesque church which previously occupied the site and&nbsp;of which the only relic is the chapel in the south transept. The&nbsp;choir alone was constructed in the 14th century. The nave of&nbsp;the church belongs to the 15th century, by the end of which&nbsp;the central tower with its octagonal'lantern and four flanking&nbsp;turrets had been erected. The building of the western facade,&nbsp;which is flanked by two towers, was not undertaken till 1846.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
