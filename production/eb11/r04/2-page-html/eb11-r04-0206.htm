<p><span class="font2">are placed in a horizontal position, have' a lateral movement, so that the finished yarn may be wound on evenly. This machine is&nbsp;made for ordinary rope yarn, and for binder twine for self-reaping&nbsp;machines. When all three spreading machines arc used in conjunction with the spiral drawing frames, the automatic feeding&nbsp;arrangement is sometimes considered unnecessary, because of the&nbsp;uniformity of the slivers when delivered from the finishing drawing</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">. frame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Whence / = *536 ft., say -54 ft. per lb; that is to say, 1 lb of Manila fibre, approximately 6 in. in length, spread on the feed-table of No. 1 spreading and hackling machine, and subjected to&nbsp;the above drafts and doublings, would produce yarn No. 22&quot; of&nbsp;330 ft. per lb from the automatic spinner.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The bobbins from these automatic spinners may be used in the bank at the rope-walk as already indicated, or they may be taken&nbsp;to what is termed a “ house machine.” These machines are of&nbsp;two distinct kinds—vertical and horizontal. They perform the&nbsp;same work as the machines in the rope-walk, but take up much&nbsp;less space.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">’ Figs. 16 and 17, Plate IV., illustrate two types of horizontal machines, each of which is capable of completing a rope in one&nbsp;operation. The process is pretty clear in fig. 17, which shows that&nbsp;eighteen threads are treated at once. On the right, and driven by&nbsp;spur gearing, arc three revolving carriages or creels, each containing&nbsp;six bobbins. Each group revolves as the yarns are drawn off the&nbsp;bobbins, and thus the threads are formed into three strands.’ As&nbsp;the strands emerge from the guides, they converge towards three&nbsp;other guides, are laid together, and finally the finished rope is wound&nbsp;on to the reel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In principle the vertical machine is the same as the horizontal machine, and the rope is, consequently, made in one operation.&nbsp;Any number of bobbins, from 24 to 128, may be twisted at the same&nbsp;time; the machine in fig. 18, Plate IV., is for making a rope of&nbsp;three strands, each with 12 threads, or 36 threads in all. These&nbsp;machines are also made to make ropes of four strands. The strands&nbsp;are formed by the rotation of the carriages, from the top of which&nbsp;each strand passes. The three strands then converge to, and pass&nbsp;through, the top of the machine, where they are laid into a rope.&nbsp;The latter passes over a series of guide pulleys, and is ultimately&nbsp;wound on the large drum shown In front of the machine. Such a&nbsp;machine for making a 128-thread, four-strand rope, occupies only&nbsp;about 125 sq. ft.—8 ft. 9 in.Xi4 ft. 4 in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In addition to the heavy rope there are many varieties of cord and twine made by means of the preparing, spinning and&nbsp;doubling machines. The fishing industry takes many different&nbsp;types for lines and nets, while the variety of cord and twine&nbsp;for other industrial and for household purposes is almost unlimited. All yarn from long vegetable fibre is more or less&nbsp;rough as it leaves the spinning frame, even after two or more&nbsp;threads have been twisted together. It is therefore necessary,&nbsp;for many uses, to impart </span><span class="font3">a </span><span class="font2">polish to the cord or twine. Special&nbsp;machines are used for this purpose. A certain number of&nbsp;bobbins, depending upon the capacity of the machine, are placed&nbsp;in a bank, and the ends are collected and passed under a roller&nbsp;which is immersed in hot starch. The yarns become saturated</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">with this starch, but, as they emerge from the starch-box, the superfluous starch is removed by passing the yarns between&nbsp;two rollers. The yarns now pass over a series of drying cylinders&nbsp;and polishing rollers, and are finally rewound by the same&nbsp;machine on bobbins. These machines are termed bobbin-to-bobbin polishing machines. In some cases the hot drying&nbsp;cylinders are replaced by a system of hot air drying. The&nbsp;finished yarns are now made up by machinery into hanks,&nbsp;balls or cheeses, according to which happens to be the best&nbsp;state for future use and for transport.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Driving Ropes.—</span><span class="font2">It has already been stated that cotton driving ropes are extensively applied in the transmission of motive power.&nbsp;Although the mechanical efficiency of transmission.by ropes is less&nbsp;than that obtained by wheel gearing, rope driving has several&nbsp;compensating advantages:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is practically noiseless.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It occupies less space than belt driving, and the slip is not</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">so great.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turning movement is better; machines therefore run more</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">steadily and production is increased.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shafts may be run at higher speeds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Greater range of drives; anything from IO ft. to over 80 ft.,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and much greater distances when carrier pulleys are used.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drive is usually obtained by a number of ropes; if one</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">should break, the rope, may be removed and the machinery run, in most cases, until stopping-time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The number of ropes to be used depends upon the power to be transmitted and upon the surface speed of the driving pulley. The&nbsp;speed of the rope may vary from 2000 ft. to 6000 ft. or over&nbsp;per minute. .In some few exceptional cases 60 ropes have been&nbsp;used on one pulley; the number usually varies between 15 and 40.&nbsp;(See also </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Power Transmission, § </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Mechanical.)</span><span class="font2"> Fig. 6 shows the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">application of these ropes, which pass direct from the main driving pulley </span><span class="font1">to </span><span class="font2">the different flats of the mill. Fig. 7 shows the construction of the Lambeth</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">four - strand cotton</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">rope. There are two</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">distinct systems of ar</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">the driver and the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">driven pulleys. In the</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">United Kingdom each</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">rope is independent of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">all . the others, and, as</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">it is unlikely for more</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">than one rope to break at a time, the stoppages are reduced to a minimum. In America, where hemp ropes are largely employed,</span></p>
