A ſmall part of the city is ſeparated ſrom the other by the river, and is therefore called </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Traveftere,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or beyond the Tiber. There are ſeveral bridges&nbsp;over the river, a great number of towers on the walls,&nbsp;and 20 gates. The remains of Rome’s ancient grandeur conſiſt of ſtatues, coloffuſes, temples, palaces,&nbsp;theatres, naumachias, triumphal arches, circuſes, columns, obeliſhs, fountains, aqueducts, mauſoleums, thermae or hot-baths, and other ſtructures. Of modern&nbsp;buildings, the ſplendid churches and palaces are the&nbsp;moſt remarkable. Mr Addiſon ſays, it is almoſt impoſſible for a man to form in his imagination ſuch beautiful and glorious ſcenes as are to be met with in ſeveral of the Roman churches and chapels. This gentleman tells us alſo, that no part of the antiquities of&nbsp;Rome pleaſed him ſo much as the ancient ſtatues, of&nbsp;which there is ſtill an incredible variety. Next to the&nbsp;ſtatues, he ſays, there is nothing more lurpriſing than&nbsp;the amazing variety of ancient pillars of ſo many kinds&nbsp;of marble. Rome is ſaid to be well paved ; but not&nbsp;well lighted, nor kept very clean, Two-thirds of the&nbsp;houſes are the property of the churches, convents, and&nbsp;alms houſes. Proteſtants are not obliged to kneel at&nbsp;the elevation of the hoſt, or at meeting the euchariſt&nbsp;in the ſtreets ; and they may have ſteſh-meat always at&nbsp;the inns, even during Lent. Here are many academies for promoting arts and ſciences, beſides the univerſity. The carnival here is only during the eight&nbsp;days before Lent, and there are no ſuch ſcenes of riot&nbsp;as at Venice : proſtitutes, however, are publicly tolerated. To maintain good order, there is a body of&nbsp;300 Sbirri, or Halberdeers, under their barigella, or&nbsp;colonel. There is little or no trade carried on in Rome,&nbsp;but a vaſt deal of money is ſpent by travellers and&nbsp;other ſtrangers. The principal modern ſtructures are&nbsp;the church of St Peter, and the other churches ; the&nbsp;aqueducts and fountains ; the Vatican, and the other&nbsp;palaces ; the Campidolio, where the Roman ſenate re-fides, &amp;c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 he principal remains of antiquity are the</span></p>
