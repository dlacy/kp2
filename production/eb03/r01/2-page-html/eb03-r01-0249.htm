<p><span class="font0">breach, to prevent the</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font0">enemy from entering the city that way. At the ſeme time, they detached a ſquadron&nbsp;of their beſt ſhips, under the command of Amyntas,&nbsp;who made over to the continent of Alia ; and there&nbsp;meeting with ſome privateers who were commiſſioned&nbsp;by Demetrius, took both the ſhips and the men, among&nbsp;whom were Timocles the chief of the pirates, and ſeveral other officers of diſtinction belonging to the fleet&nbsp;of Demetrius. On their return, they fell in with ſeveral veſſels laden with corn for the enemy’s camp, which&nbsp;they likewiſe took,, and brought into the port. Theſe&nbsp;were ſoon followed by a numerous fleet of ſmall veſſels&nbsp;loaded with corn and proviſions ſent them by Ptolemy,&nbsp;together with 1500 men, commanded by Antigonus a&nbsp;Macedonian of great experience in military affairs.—&nbsp;Demetrius, in the mean time, having repaired his machines, brought them up anew to the walls ; which he&nbsp;inceſſantly battered till he opened a great breach and&nbsp;threw down ſeveral towers. But when he came to the&nbsp;aſſault, the Rhodians, under the command of Aminias,&nbsp;defended themfelves with ſuch refolution and intrepidity, that he was in three ſucceſſive attacks repulſed&nbsp;with great laughter, and at laſt forced to retire. The&nbsp;Rhodians likewiſe, on this occaſion, loſt ſeveral officers ; and amongſt others, the brave Aminias their commander.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">while the Rhodians were thus ſignalizing 'them-ſelves in the defence of their country, a ſecond embaſſy arrived at the camp of Demetrius from Athens and&nbsp;the other cities of Greece, ſoliciting Demetrius to compote matters, and ſtrike up a peace with the Rhodians.&nbsp;At the requeſt of the ambaſſadors, who were in all&nbsp;above 50, a ceſſation of arms was agreed upon; but&nbsp;the terms offered by Demetrius being anew rejected by&nbsp;the Rhodians, the ambaſſadors returned home without&nbsp;being able to bring the contending parties to an agreement. Hoſtilities were therefore renewed; and Demetrius, whoſe imagination was fertile in expedients for&nbsp;ſucceeding in his projects, formed a detachment of&nbsp;1500 of his beſt troops, under the conduct of Alcimus&nbsp;and Mancius, two officers of great reſolution and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">experience,</span><span class="font0"> ordering them to enter the breach at mid-night, and, forcing the entrenchment behind it, to poſſeſs themſelves of the polls about the theatre, where it&nbsp;would be no difficult matter to maintain themſelves&nbsp;againſt any efforts of the townſmen. In order to facilitate the execution of fo important and dangerous&nbsp;an undertaking, and amuſe the enemy with falſe attacks, he at the ſame time, upon a ſignal given, ordered the reft of the army to ſet up a ſhout, and attack the&nbsp;city on all ſides both by ſea and land. By this means&nbsp;he hoped that, the beſieged being alarmed in all parts,&nbsp;his detachment might find an opportunity of forcing&nbsp;the entrenchments which covered the breach, and afterwards of ſeizing the advantageous poll about the&nbsp;theatre. This feint had all the ſucceſs the prince could&nbsp;expect ; for the troops having ſet up a ſhout from&nbsp;all quarters, as if they were advancing to a general&nbsp;nſſault, the detachment commanded by Alcimus and&nbsp;Mancius entered the breach, and fell upon thoſe who&nbsp;defended the ditch, and the wall that covered it, with&nbsp;ſuch vigour, that, having ſlain the moſt part of them&nbsp;and put the reſt in confuſion, they advanced to the&nbsp;theatre, and ſeized on the poſt adjoining to it. This&nbsp;occaſioned</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font0">a general uproar in the city, as if it had</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font0">been&nbsp;already taken : but the commanding officers diſpatched&nbsp;orders to the ſoldiers on the ramparts not to quit their&nbsp;poſts, nor ſtir from their reſpective ſtations. Having&nbsp;thus ſecured the walls, they put themſelves at the head&nbsp;of a choſen body of their own troops, and of thoſe who&nbsp;were lately come from Egypt, and with theſe charged&nbsp;the enemy’s detachment. But the darkneſs of the night&nbsp;prevented them from diſlodging the enemy and regaining the advantageous poſts they had ſeized. Day,&nbsp;however, no ſooner appeared, than they renewed their&nbsp;attack with wonderful bravery. The Demetrians without the walls, with loud ſhouts endeavoured to animate&nbsp;thoſe who had entered the place, and inſpire them with&nbsp;resolution to maintain their ground till they were relieved with freſh troops. The Rhodians being ſenſible that their fortunes, liberties, and all that was dear</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">to them in the world, lay at ſtake, fought like men in&nbsp;the utmoſt deſpair, the enemy defending their poſts for&nbsp;ſeveral hours without giving ground in the leaſt. At&nbsp;length the Rhodians, encouraging each other to exert&nbsp;themfelves in defence of their country, and animated&nbsp;by the example of their leaders, made a laſt effort, and,&nbsp;breaking into the very heart of the enemy’s battalion,&nbsp;there killed both their commanders. After their death&nbsp;the reſt were eaſily put in diforder, and all to a man&nbsp;either killed or taken prifoners. The Rhodians like-wile on this occaſion loſt many of their beſt commanders ; and among the reſt Damotetis, their chief magiſtrate, a man of extraordinary valour, who had ſignalized himſelf during the whole time of the ſiege.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Demetrius, not at all diſcouraged by this check, was making the neceſſary preparations for a new aſſault,&nbsp;when he received letters from his father Antigonus, enjoining him to conclude a peace with the Rhodians&nbsp;upon the beſt terms he could get, left he ſhould loſe&nbsp;his whole army in the ſiege of a lingle town. From&nbsp;this time Demetrius wanted only ſome plauſible pretence for breaking up the ſiege. The Rhodians likewiſe were now more inclined to come to an agreement&nbsp;than formerly ; Ptolemy having acquainted them that&nbsp;he intended to tend a great quantity of corn, and 3000&nbsp;men to their aſſiſtance, but that he would firſt have&nbsp;them try whether they could make up matters with Demetrius upon reaſonable terms. At the fame time ambaſſadors arrived from the Ætolian republic, ſoliciting&nbsp;the contending parties to put an cnd to a war which&nbsp;might involve all the eaſt in endleſs calamities.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An accident which happened to Demetrius in this conjuncture, did not a little contribute towards the&nbsp;wiſhed-for pacification. This prince was preparing to&nbsp;advance his helepolis againſt the city, when a Rhodian&nbsp;engineer found means to render it quite uſeleſs. He&nbsp;undermined the tract of ground over which the helepolis&nbsp;was to paſs the next day in order to approach the walls.&nbsp;Demetrius, not ſuſpecting any ſtratagem of this nature,&nbsp;cauſed the engine to be moved forward, which coming&nbsp;to the place that was undermined, ſunk ſo deep into&nbsp;the ground that it was impoſſible to draw it out again.&nbsp;This misfortune, if we believe Vegetius and Vitruvius,&nbsp;determined Demetrius to hearken to the Ætolian ambaſſadors, and at laſt to ſtrike up a peace upon the following conditions: That the republic of Rhodes ſhould&nbsp;be maintained in the full enjoyment of their ancient&nbsp;rights, privileges, and liberties, without any foreign&nbsp;garriſon ; that they ſhould renew their ancient alliance</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
