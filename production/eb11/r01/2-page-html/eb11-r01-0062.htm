<p><span class="font1">of the public treasury, to arrange its rates to pay interest on its securities; a private company will generally be prevented, by&nbsp;the indirect competition of railways in other parts of the country&nbsp;which it serves, from doing very much more than this. The&nbsp;relative merit of the two systems depends upon the question&nbsp;how we can secure the best efficiency and equity in the application of the principles thus far laid down. There are three&nbsp;different systems of control: —</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Private operation, subject only to judicial regulation,</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;exemplified most fully in the early railway history of the United&nbsp;States. Until 1870 railway companies were almost free from&nbsp;special acts of control; and, in general, any company that&nbsp;could raise or borrow the capital was allowed to build a railway&nbsp;wherever it saw fit. In the United Kingdom there was almost&nbsp;as much immunity from legislative interference with charges,&nbsp;but the companies were compelled to secure special charters,&nbsp;and to conform to regulations made by the Board of Trade in&nbsp;the interests of public safety. The advantage of this relatively&nbsp;free system of railway building and management is that it&nbsp;secures efficient and progressive methods. Most of the im-provements in operation and in traffic management have had&nbsp;their origin in one of these two countries. The disadvantage&nbsp;attendant upon this system is that the courts are reluctant to&nbsp;exercise the right of regulation, except on old and traditional&nbsp;lines, and that in the face of new business methods the public&nbsp;may be inadequately protected. There is also this further&nbsp;disadvantage, that in the gradual progress of consolidation&nbsp;railway companies take upon themselves the aspect of large&nbsp;monopolies, of whose apparently unrestricted power the public&nbsp;is jealous. As a result of these difficulties there has been, both&nbsp;in the United Kingdom and in the United States, a progressive&nbsp;increase of legislative interference with railways. In the former&nbsp;the Railway and Canal Traffic Act of 1854 specially prohibited&nbsp;preferences, either in facilities or in rates. The Regulation of&nbsp;Railways Act of 1873 provided for a Railway Commission,&nbsp;which should be so constituted as to take cognizance of cases&nbsp;on the investigation of which the courts were reluctant to enter.&nbsp;Finally, the legislation of 1888 put into the hands of a reorganized&nbsp;Railway Commission and of the Board of Trade powers none&nbsp;the less important in principle because their action has been&nbsp;less in its practical effect than the advocates of active control&nbsp;demanded. In the United States the years from 1870 to 1875&nbsp;witnessed sweeping and generally ill-considered legislation&nbsp;(“ Granger ” Acts) concerning railway charges throughout&nbsp;the Mississippi valley; while the years from 1884 to 1887 were&nbsp;marked by more conservative, and for that reason more en-forceable, acts, which culminated in the Interstate Commerce&nbsp;Act, prohibiting personal discrimination and gradually restricting discrimination between places, and providing for a National&nbsp;Commission of very considerable power—not to speak of the&nbsp;pooling clause, which was extraneous to the general purpose&nbsp;of the act, and has tended to defeat rather than strengthen its&nbsp;operation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">2.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Operation by private companies, under specific provisions&nbsp;of the government authorities with regard to the method of its&nbsp;exercise,</span><span class="font1"> has been the policy consistently carried out in France,&nbsp;and less systematically and consistently in other countries&nbsp;under the domination of the Latin race. It was believed by its&nbsp;advocates that this system of prescribing the conditions of&nbsp;construction and operation of lines could promote public safety,&nbsp;prevent waste of capital and secure passengers and shippers&nbsp;against extortionate rates. These expectations have been only&nbsp;partially fulfilled. Well trained as was the civil service of&nbsp;France, the effect of this supervision in deadening activity&nbsp;was sometimes more marked than in its effect in preventing&nbsp;abuse. Moreover, such a system of regulation almost necessarily&nbsp;carries with it a guarantee of monopoly to the various companies concerned, and not infrequently large gifts in the form&nbsp;of subsidies, for without such aid private capital will not submit to the special burdens involved. These rights, whether of&nbsp;monopoly or of subsidy, form a means of abuse in many direc-tions. Where the government is bad, they are a fruitful&nbsp;source of corruption; even where it is good, they enable the&nbsp;companies to drive hard bargains with the public, and prevent&nbsp;the expected benefits of official control from being realized.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">3.  </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State operation and ownership</span><span class="font1"> is a system which originated&nbsp;in Belgium at the beginning of railway enterprise, and has been&nbsp;consistently carried out by the Scandinavian countries and by&nbsp;Hungary. Since i860 it has been the policy of Australia.&nbsp;It has generally come to be that of Germany and, so far as the&nbsp;finances of the countries allow, of Austria and Russia; British&nbsp;India also affords not a few examples of the same method. The&nbsp;theory of state ownership is excellent. So large a part of&nbsp;the railway charge is of the nature of a tax, that there seem to&nbsp;be a priori reasons for leaving the taxing powers in the hands of&nbsp;the agents of the government. In practice its operation is far&nbsp;more uncertain. Whether the intelligence and efficiency of the&nbsp;officials charged by the state with the handling of its railway&nbsp;system will be sufficient to make them act in the interest of the&nbsp;public as fully as do the managers of private corporations, is a&nbsp;question whose answer can only be determined by actual&nbsp;experience in each case. If they fail to have these qualities,&nbsp;the complete monopoly which a government enjoys, and the&nbsp;powers of borrowing which are furnished by the use of the public&nbsp;credit, increase instead of diminishing the danger of arbitrary&nbsp;action, unprogressiveness and waste of capital. Even in&nbsp;matters like public safety it is by no means certain that government authorities will do so well as private ones. The question&nbsp;is one which practical railway men have long since ceased to&nbsp;argue on general principles; they recognize that the answer&nbsp;depends upon the respective degree of talent and integrity&nbsp;which characterize the business community on the one hand and&nbsp;the government officials on the other.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">British Railway Legislation</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The first thing a railway company in Great Britain has to do is to obtain a special or private act of parliament authorizing the&nbsp;construction of the line. Not that the mere laying or&nbsp;working of a railway requires parliamentary sanction,&nbsp;so long as the work does not interfere with other&nbsp;people’s rights and interests. An example of a railway built&nbsp;without any legislative authority is the little mountain railway&nbsp;from Llanberis to the summit of Snowdon, which was made by&nbsp;the owner of the land through which it passes. Such a railway&nbsp;has no statutory rights and no special obligations, and the&nbsp;owner of it is liable to be sued for creating a nuisance if the work-ing of the line interferes with the comfort of those residing in the&nbsp;neighbourhood. When, however, a company desires to construct&nbsp;a line on a commercial scale, to acquire land compulsorily, to&nbsp;divert rivers and streams, to cross roads either on the level or&nbsp;by means of bridges, to pass near houses, to build tunnels or&nbsp;viaducts, and to execute all the other works incidental to a&nbsp;railway, and to work the line when completed without interference, it is essential that the authority of parliament should&nbsp;be obtained. The company therefore promotes a bill, which&nbsp;is considered first by select committees of the two houses of&nbsp;parliament, and afterwards by the two houses themselves,&nbsp;during which period it faces the opposition, if any, of rival&nbsp;concerns, of local authorities and of hostile landowners. If&nbsp;this is successfully overcome, and the proposals meet with the</span></p>
