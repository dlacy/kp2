<p><span class="font0">is almoſt in vain to look for principle in the rules adopted by our profeſſed architects. We cannot help thinking, that much of their practice reſults from a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pedantic </span><span class="font0">veneration for the beautiſul productions of Grecian architecture. Such architects as have written on the&nbsp;principles of the art in reſpect of proportions, or what&nbsp;they call the ordonnance, are very much puzzled to&nbsp;make a chain of reaſoning ; and the moſt that they&nbsp;have made of the Greek architecture is, that it exhibits&nbsp;a nice adjuſtment of ſtrength and ſtrain. But when we&nbsp;conſider the extent of this adjuſtment, we find that it is&nbsp;wonderfully limited. The whole of it conſiſts of a&nbsp;baſcment, a column, and an entablature ; and the entablature, it is true, exhibits ſomething of a connection&nbsp;with the framework and roof of a wooden building ;&nbsp;and we believe that it really originated from this in the&nbsp;hands of the orientals, from whom the Greeks certainly&nbsp;borrowed their forms and their combinations. We could&nbsp;eaſily ſhow in the ruins of Perſepolis, and among the&nbsp;tombs in the mountains (which were long prior to the&nbsp;Greek architecture), the fluted column, the baſe, the&nbsp;Ionic and Corinthian capital, and the Doric arrangement of lintels, beams, and rafters, all derived from&nbsp;unqueſtionable principle. The only addition made by&nbsp;the Greeks was the pent roof ; and the changes made&nbsp;by them in the ſubordinate forms of things are ſuch as&nbsp;we ſhould expect ſrom their exquiſite judgment of&nbsp;beauty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the whole of this is very limited ; and the Greeks, after making the roof a chief feature of a houſe, went&nbsp;no farther, and contented themſelves with giving it a&nbsp;ſlope ſuited to their climate. This we have followed,&nbsp;becauſe in the milder parts of Europe we have no cogent reaſon for deviating from it ; and if any architect&nbsp;ſhould deviate greatly in a building where the outline is&nbsp;exhibited as beautiful, we ſhould be diſguſted ; but the&nbsp;diſguſt, though felt by almoſt every ſpectator, has its&nbsp;origin in nothing but habit.. In the profeiſed architect&nbsp;or man of education, the diſguſt ariſes from pedantry:&nbsp;for there is not ſuch a cloſe connection between the form&nbsp;and uſes of a roof as ſhall give precife determinations ;&nbsp;and the mere form is a matter of indifference.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We ſhould not therefore reprobate the high-pitched roofs of our anceſtors, particularly on the continent.&nbsp;It is there where we ſee them in all the extremity of&nbsp;the faſhion, and the taſte is by no means exploded as it&nbsp;is with us. A baronial caſtle in Germany and France&nbsp;is ſeldom rebuilt in the pure Greek ſtyle, or even&nbsp;like the modern houſes in Britain ; the high-pitched&nbsp;roofs are retained. We ſhould not call them Gothic,&nbsp;and ugly becauſe Gothic, till we ſhow their principle to&nbsp;be falſe or taſteleſs. Now we apprehend that it will&nbsp;be found quite the reverſe ; and that though we cannot&nbsp;bring ourſelves to think them beautiful, we ought to&nbsp;think them ſo. The conſtruction of the Greek architecture is a transference of the practices that are neceſſary in a wooden building to a building of ſtone. To&nbsp;this the Greeks have adhered, in ſpite of innumerable&nbsp;difficulties. Their marble quarries, however, put it in&nbsp;their power to retain the proportions which habit had&nbsp;rendered agreeable. But it is next to impoſſible to adhere to theſe proportions with freeſtone or brick, when&nbsp;the order is of magnificent dimenſions. Sir Chriſtopher&nbsp;Wren ſaw this; for his mechanical knowledge was equal&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to his taſte. He compoſed the front of St Paul’s church&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in London of two orders, and he coupled his columns ;&nbsp;and ſtill the lintels which form the architrave are of ſuch&nbsp;length that they could carry no additional weight, and&nbsp;he was obliged to truſs them behind. Had he made&nbsp;but one order, the architrave could not have carried its&nbsp;own weight. It is impoſſible to execute a Doric entablature of this ſize in brick. It is attempted in a very&nbsp;noble front, the Academy of Arts in St Peterſhurgh.&nbsp;But the architect was obliged to make the mutules and&nbsp;other projecting members of the corniche of granite,&nbsp;and many of them broke down by their own weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Here is ſurely an error in principle. Since ſtone is the chief material of our buildings, ought not the members Qf ornamented architecture to be refinements on&nbsp;the eſſential and unaffected parts of a ſimple ſtone-.building. There is almoſt as much propriety in the&nbsp;architecture of India, where a dome is made in imita-tation of a lilly or other flower inverted, as in the&nbsp;Greek imitation of a wooden building. The principles&nbsp;of maſonry, and not of carpentry, ſhould be ſeen in our&nbsp;architecture, if we would have it according to the rules&nbsp;of juſt taſte. Now we affirm that this is the characteriſtic feature of what is called the Gothic architecture.&nbsp;In this no dependence is had on the tranſverſe ſtrength&nbsp;of ſtone·. No lintels are to be ſeen ; no extravagant&nbsp;projections. Every ſtone is preſſed to its neighbours,&nbsp;and none is expoſed to a tranſverſe ſtrain. The Greeks&nbsp;were enabled to execute their coloſſal buildings only by&nbsp;uſing immenſe blocks of the hardeſt materials. The&nbsp;Norman maſon could raiſe a building to the ikies without uſing a ſtone which a labourer could not carry to&nbsp;the top on his back. Their architects ſtudied the principles of equilibrium j<sub>x</sub>and having attained a wonderful&nbsp;knowledge of it, they indulged themſelves in exhibiting&nbsp;remarkable inſtances. We call this falſe taſte, and ſay&nbsp;that the appearance of inſecurity is the greateſt fault.&nbsp;But this is owing to our habits : our thoughts may be&nbsp;ſaid to run in a∙ wooden train, and certain ſimple maxims of carpentry are familiar to our imagination ; and&nbsp;in the careful adherence to theſe conſiſts the beauty and&nbsp;ſymmetry of the Greek architecture. Had we been as&nbsp;much habituated to the equilibrium of preſſure, this apparent inſecurity would not have met our eye : we&nbsp;would have perceived the ſtrength, and we ſhould have&nbsp;reliſhed the ingenuity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Gothic architecture is perhaps intitled to the name of rational architecture, and its beauty is founded&nbsp;on the characteriſtic diſtinction of our ſpecies. It deſerves cultivation : not the pitiful, ſervile, and un-ſkilled copying of the monuments ; this will produce&nbsp;incongruities and abſurdities equal to any that have&nbsp;crept into the Greek architecture : but let us examine&nbsp;with attention the nice diſpoſition of the groins and&nbsp;ſpaundrels ; let us ſtudy the tracery and knots, not as&nbsp;ornaments, but as uſeful members ; let us obſerve how&nbsp;they have made their walls like honey-combs, and admire their ingenuity as we pretend to admire the inſtinct&nbsp;infuſed by the great architect into the bee. All this&nbsp;cannot be underſtood without mechanical knowledge ; a&nbsp;thing which few of our profeſſional architects have any&nbsp;ſhare of. Thus would architectonic taſte be a mark of&nbsp;ſkill ; and the perſon who preſents the deſign of a building would know how to excite it, without committing&nbsp;it entirely to the maſon and carpenter.</span></p>
