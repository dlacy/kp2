<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">exist only in contemplation.” Corporeal hereditaments are all necessarily freehold ;@@<sup>1</sup> an interest in land less than freehold, such&nbsp;as a term of years, is personalty only. There Aras no room for such&nbsp;an interest in the feudal gradation of tenure ; it was regarded as a&nbsp;mere personal contract and was incapable of the incidents of tenure.&nbsp;By the Conveyancing Act, 1881 (44 and 45 Viet. c. 41, s. 65), the&nbsp;residue of a long term of years may in certain casés be enlarged&nbsp;into the fee-simple. A copyhold is in strict law only a tenancy&nbsp;at the will of the lord (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Copyhold). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Estates of freehold are&nbsp;either estates for life or in fee (called also estates of inheritance),&nbsp;the latter being in fee-tail or in fee-simple. An estate for life may&nbsp;he either for the life of the tenant or for the life of another person,&nbsp;the latter called an estate </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pur autre vie.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The former kind of&nbsp;estate includes estates of dower and curtesy (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Husband and&nbsp;Wife). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">An estate in fee is called a fee simply, an obvious sign of&nbsp;its feudal origin. Estates tail are either general or special, the&nbsp;latter being in tail male or (rarely) in tail female. There may also&nbsp;be a quasi-entail of an estate </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">pur autre vie</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Entail). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">An&nbsp;estate in fee-simple is the largest estate known to English laAV.&nbsp;Its ordinary incidents are an oath of fealty (never exacted),&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Escheat </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> ), and (in a manor) suit of the court baron, and&nbsp;occasionally a small quit-rent and relief. All these are obviously&nbsp;relics of the once important feudal incidents. Incorporeal hereditaments consist chiefly, if not wholly, of rights </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">in alicno solo.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> They&nbsp;are divided by Mr Joshua Williams (</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Real Property,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> pt. ii.) into (1)&nbsp;reversions, remainders, and executory interests, (2) hereditaments&nbsp;purely incorporeal, the last being either appendant, appurtenant, </span><span class="font0">Ol</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">in gross. Examples are profits </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a prendre</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> (such as rights of common),&nbsp;easements (such as rights of way),@@<sup>2</sup> seigniories, advoAVSons, rents,&nbsp;tithes, titles of honour, offices, franchises. Before 1845 corporeal&nbsp;hereditaments were said to lie in livery, incorporeal in grant. But&nbsp;by 8 and 9 Viet. c. 106, s. 2, all corporeal hereditaments are, as&nbsp;regards the conveyance of the immediate freehold thereof, to be&nbsp;deemed to lie in grant as well as in livery. With regard to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">time</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> of enjoyment, estates are either in possession or in expectancy,&nbsp;—that is, in reversion or remainder or executory interests (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Remainder). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">With regard to the </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">mode</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> of enjoyment, estates are&nbsp;either joint, in common, in coparcenary, or in severalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Exceptional Tenures.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—It has been already stated that there are still to be found survivals of the old pre-Conquest customary law.&nbsp;They are found both in the tenure and in the conveyance of land.&nbsp;The only customs of which judicial notice is taken are </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Gavelkind&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Borough-English </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> Any other local customs, as in&nbsp;manors, must be proved by evidence. The tenures of frankalmoign&nbsp;and grand serjeanty Avere specially preserved by 12 Car. II. c. 24.&nbsp;Tenure in frankalmoign is the nearest approach in English law to&nbsp;absolute OAvnership. An estate in frankalmoign has no incidents,&nbsp;as it is held simply by divine service and is not subject to escheat.&nbsp;All tenures in frankalmoign must (except where created by the&nbsp;crown) be older than </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Quia Emptores.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> The tenure of grand serjeanty&nbsp;is the holding of lands by doing a personal service to the king, as&nbsp;carrying his banner or sword. Petit serjeanty consists in the payment to the king yearly of a bow, sword, dagger, or such other&nbsp;small things belonging to war (Littleton, § 159). It is in effect socage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Title.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—This is the name given to the mode of acquisition of rights over real estate. Title may arise either by alienation,&nbsp;voluntary or involuntary, or by succession. Voluntary alienation&nbsp;is either </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">inter vivos</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> or by will. The former branch is practically&nbsp;synonymous with conveyance, Avhether by way of sale, settlement,&nbsp;mortgage, or otherwise. As a general rule alienation of real estate&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">inter vivos</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> must be by deed since 8 and 9 Viet. c. 106. Since that&nbsp;Act a deed of grant has superseded the old forms of feoffment and&nbsp;lease and release. Considerable alterations in the direction of&nbsp;shortness and simplicity have been made in the laAV of transfer of&nbsp;real estate by the Conveyancing Acts, 1881, 1882 (44 and 45 Viet,&nbsp;c. 41, 45 and 46 Viet. c. 39). The word “grant” is no longer&nbsp;necessary for a conveyance, nor are the old words of limitation&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> heirs ” and </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> heirs of the body. ” It is sufficient to use the words&nbsp;“in fee-simple,” “in tail,” “in tail male,” “in tail female.” Many&nbsp;provisions usually inserted in deeds, such as covenants for title by&nbsp;a beneficial OAvner and powers of appointment of neAV trustees,&nbsp;obtain statutory sanction. Forms of mortgage, conveyance, and&nbsp;settlement are appended to the Act. The Solicitors’ Remuneration&nbsp;Act, 1881 (44 and 45 Viet. c. 44), was passed as a necessary sequel&nbsp;to the Conveyancing Act, and the remuneration of solicitors </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">uoav&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">stands upon a different and more satisfactory basis. For acquisition by Avili and succession, see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Will, Inheritance. </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Involuntary&nbsp;alienation is by </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bankruptcy </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and by other means of enforcing&nbsp;the rights of creditors over land, such as distress or execution. It&nbsp;may also arise by the exercise by the state of its right of eminent&nbsp;domain for public purposes, as under the Lands Clauses and other&nbsp;Acts.@@<sup>3</sup> In sales of real estate title is generally traced in an abstract&nbsp;delivered by the vendor (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sale).</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup></span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the category of corporeal hereditaments are also included, certain accessories to </span><span class="font1">corporeal </span><span class="font2">hereditaments </span><span class="font1">proper, </span><span class="font2">such as </span><span class="font1">groAving </span><span class="font2">crops, fixtures, title-deeds, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@2</sup></span><span class="font2"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It should be noticed that an easement in gross cannot exist.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Restraints on Alienation.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—The alienation of real estate may be subject to almost any conditions, provided that such conditions do&nbsp;not contravene the law. As a general rule there can be no restrictions upon the alienation of an estate in fee-simple </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the tAvo ideas&nbsp;are incompatible. In the case, hoAvever, of a married Avoman a&nbsp;restraint on anticipation is allowed Avithin certain limits. The&nbsp;poAver of imposing such a restraint is preserved by the Married&nbsp;Women’s Property Act, 1882 (45 and 46 Viet. c. 75, s. 19), subject&nbsp;to the right of the court to bind the interest of the married woman&nbsp;Avhere it would be for her benefit to do so (44 and 45 Viet. c. 41, s.&nbsp;39). In another direction the imposition of a course of devolution&nbsp;upon property is forbidden by the law against perpetuities, under&nbsp;Avliich no executory interest can be made to commence unless&nbsp;within the period of any fixed number of existing lives, and an&nbsp;additional period of twenty-one years (with a few months added, if&nbsp;necessary, for the period of gestation). Accumulation of income&nbsp;is forbidden (with a feAv exceptions) by the Thelusson Act (39 and&nbsp;40 Geo. III. c. 98) for any longer term than the life of the grantor&nbsp;or settlor, or twenty-one years from his death, or during a period&nbsp;of minority. Certain persons are by the general policy of the law&nbsp;disabled from exercising full proprietary rights, such as married&nbsp;women (see above), convicts, infants, and lunatics. Estates tail&nbsp;are in general alienable under the Fines and Recoveries Act (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Entail). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">But in a few cases estates tail are settled inalienably&nbsp;by Act of Parliament, generally as a reAvard for public services.&nbsp;Estates are thus settled to go Avith the titles of Marlborough,&nbsp;Wellington, Abergavenny, and Shrewsbury.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Exceptional Modes of Alienation.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—In some of these cases, like those of the exceptional tenures, the influence of the old customary&nbsp;law is to be traced. The transfer of copyholds especially depends&nbsp;to a great extent upon the custom of particular manors, but, subject&nbsp;to that, it usually takes place by surrender and admittance (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Copyhold). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Gavelkind lands may be conveyed by feoffment </span><span class="font3">by&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">any infant above the age of fifteen. For mines in the Forest of&nbsp;Dean a peculiar mode of transfer is provided by 1 and 2 Viet. c.&nbsp;43. In the Isle of Portland there seems to be a distinct survival&nbsp;of the pre-feudal conveyance. The vendor and purchaser meet in&nbsp;the parish church, where a deed is signed by the parties in the&nbsp;presence of two householders of the island. These deeds are called&nbsp;“church gifts.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Procedure.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">—In some cases rights attaching to real estate are protected by peculiar remedies. At an early period it became more convenient to try the right to the possession of, rather than the&nbsp;right to the property in, real estate. Possessory tended to supersede proprietary remedies, from their great simplicity and elasticity.&nbsp;The general mode of trying the right to both property and possession Avas from the time of Henry II. the real action, the form called&nbsp;“ Avrit of right ” (after Magna Charta gradually confined to the Court&nbsp;of Common Pleas) being used to determine the property, that called&nbsp;“ assise of novel disseisin ” being the general means by Avhich the&nbsp;possession Avas tried. About the reign of Elizabeth the action of&nbsp;ejectment became the ordinary form of possessory remedy. Real&nbsp;actions existed until 3 and 4 Will. IV. c. 27, by which they were&nbsp;finally abolished, with the exception of Avrit of right of dower, writ&nbsp;of dower </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">unde nihil habet, quare impedit,</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> and ejectment. Of these&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Quake Impedit </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> appears to be the only one noAv in use. The&nbsp;assise of novel disseisin, the action of ejectment in both its original&nbsp;and its reformed stage (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ejectment), </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">and finally the action for&nbsp;the recovery of land in use since the Judicature Acts are all historically connected as gradual developments of the possessory action&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Possession). </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">The action for the recovery of land is still subject to special provisions and is not quite in the same position as&nbsp;an ordinary action (see Rules of the Supreme Court, 1883, Ord.&nbsp;xii. rr. 25-29, Ord. xviii. r. 2, &amp;c.). There are certain matters&nbsp;affecting real estate over which the Court of Chancery formerly had&nbsp;exclusive jurisdiction, in most cases because the principles on Avhieli&nbsp;the court acted had been the creation of equity. The Judicature&nbsp;Act, 1873 (36 and 37 Viet. c. 66, s. 34). assigns to the Chancery&nbsp;Division of the High Court of Justice all causes and matters for&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(inter alia)</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> the redemption or foreclosure of mortgages, the raising&nbsp;of portions or other charges on land, the sale and distribution of&nbsp;the proceeds of property subject to any lien or charge, the specific&nbsp;performance of contracts betAveen vendors and purchasers of real&nbsp;estates, including contracts for leases, the partition or sale of real&nbsp;estates, and the wardship of infants and the care of infants’ estates.&nbsp;In the case of rent a summary mode of remedy by act of the&nbsp;creditor still exists (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Distress, Rent).</span></p>
