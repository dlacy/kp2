<p><span class="font0">the moſt animated diſplay of eloquence, </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font0">in the moſt inſidious manner. In this letter he deſcribes himſelf&nbsp;as “ more vehement than· celebrated in his reſearches,&nbsp;but ſincere on the whole, even againſt himſelf ; ſimple&nbsp;and good, but ſenſible and weak ; often doing evil,&nbsp;and always loving good ; united by friendſhip, never&nbsp;by circumſtances, and keeping more to his opinions&nbsp;than to his intereſts ; requiring nothing of men, and&nbsp;not wiſhing to be under any obligation to them ; yielding no more to their prejudices than to their will, and&nbsp;preſerving his own as free as his reaſon; diſputing about&nbsp;religion without lſeentiouſneſs ; loving neither impiety&nbsp;nor fanaticiſm, but diſliking preciſe people more than&nbsp;bold ſpirits,” &amp;c. &amp;c. From this ſpecimen, the limitations he would appoint to this portrait may eaſily be&nbsp;dilcovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The letters of La Montaigne appeared ſoon after ; but this work, far leſs eloquent, and full of envious diſ-cuſſions on the magiſtrates and clergy of Geneva, irritated the Proteſtarit miniſters without effecting a reconciliation with the clergy of the Romiſh church. Rouſſeau had ſolemnly abjured the latter religion in 1753,&nbsp;and, what is ſomewhat ſtrange, had then reſolved to live^_&nbsp;in France, a Catholic country. The Proteſtant clergy&nbsp;were not fully reconciled by this change ; and the protection oſ the king of Pruſſia, to whom the principality&nbsp;of Neufchatel belonged, was not ſuſſicient to reſcue him&nbsp;from that obloquy which the mim'ſter of Moutiers-Travers, the village to which he had retired, had excited againſt him. He preached againſt Rouſſeau, and&nbsp;his fermons produced an uproar among the people. On&nbsp;the night between the 6th and 7th September 1765,&nbsp;ſome fanatics, drove on by wine and the declamations&nbsp;of their miniſter, threw ſome ſtones at the windows of&nbsp;the Genevan philoſopher, who fearing new inſults, in&nbsp;vain fought an aſylum in the canton of Berne. As this&nbsp;Canton was connected with the republic of Geneva,&nbsp;they did not think proper to allow him to remain in&nbsp;their city, being proſeribed by that republic. Neither&nbsp;his broken ſtate of health, nor the approach of winter,&nbsp;could ſoften the hearts of theſe obdurate Spartans. In&nbsp;vain, to prevent them from the feartheyhad of the ſpreading of his opinions, did he beſeech them to ſhut him up&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">priſon till the ſpring ; for even this favour was denied him. Obliged to ſet out on a journey, in the beginning of a very inclement ſeaſon, he reached Straſ-bourg in a very deſtitute ſituation. He received from&nbsp;Marſhal de Contades, who then commanded in that&nbsp;place, every accommodation which could be expected&nbsp;from generoſity, humanity, and compaſſion. He waited there till the weather was milder, when he went to&nbsp;Paris, where Mr Flume then was, who determined on&nbsp;taking him with him to England. After having made&nbsp;ſome ſtay in Paris, Rouſſeau actually ſet out for London in 176b. Hume, much affected with his ſituation&nbsp;and his misfortunes, procured for him a very agreeable&nbsp;ſettlement in the country. Our Genevan philoſopher was not, however, long ſatisſied with this new&nbsp;place. He did not make ſuch an impreſſion on the&nbsp;minds of the Engliſh as he had done on the French.&nbsp;His free diſpoſition, his obdurate and melancholy temper, was deemed no ſingularity in England. He was&nbsp;there looked upon as an ordinary man, and the periodical prints were filled with ſatires againſt him. In&quot;&nbsp;particular, they publiſhed a forged letter from the king&nbsp;of Pruſſia, holding </span><span class="font1">up </span><span class="font0">to ridicule the principles </span><span class="font1">and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">•conduit of tl⅛is new Diogenes. Rouſſeau imagined&nbsp;there was a plot between Hume and ſome philoſophers&nbsp;in France to deſtroy his glory and repoſe. He lent </span><span class="font1">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">letter to him, filled with the moſt abuſive expreſſions,&nbsp;and reproaching him for his conduct towards him.&nbsp;From this time he looked upon Hume as a wicked and&nbsp;perfidious perſon, wſho had brought him to England&nbsp;with no other view than to expoie him to public ridicule ; which fooliſh and chimerical idea was nouriſhed&nbsp;by ſelſ-love and a reſtleſs diſpoſition. He imagined that&nbsp;the Engliſh philoſopher, amidſt all his kindneſſes, had&nbsp;ſomething diſagreeable in the manner of expreſſing them.&nbsp;The bad health of Rouſſeau, a ſtrong and melancholy&nbsp;imagination, a too nice ſenſibility, a jealous diſpoſition,&nbsp;joined with philoſophic vanity, cheriſhed by the falle&nbsp;informations of his governeſs, who poſſeſſed an uncommon power over him ; all theſe taken together, might&nbsp;tend to prepoſſeſs him with unfavourable ſentiments of&nbsp;ſome innocent freedoms his benefactor might have taken&nbsp;with him, and might render him ungrateful, wſhich he&nbsp;thought himſelf incapable of becoming. Meanwhile,&nbsp;theſe falſe conjectures and probabilities ought never to&nbsp;have had the weight with an honeſt mind to withdraw&nbsp;itſelf from its friend and benefactor. Proofs are always&nbsp;neceſſary in caſes of this kind; and that which Rouſſeau&nbsp;had was by no means a certain demonſtration. The&nbsp;Genevan philoſopher, however, certainly returned to&nbsp;France. In paſſing through Amiens, he met with&nbsp;M. Greſſet, who interrogated him about his misfortunes and the controverſies he had been engaged in. He&nbsp;only anſwered, “ You have got the art of making a&nbsp;parrot ſpeak ; but you are not yet poſſeſſed of the ſecret of making a bear ſpeak.” In the mean time, the&nbsp;magiſtratts of this city wiſhed to confer on him ſome&nbsp;mark of their eſteem, which he abſolutely refuſed. His&nbsp;diſordered imagination viewed theſe flattering civilities&nbsp;as nothing elſe than inſults, ſuch as were laviſhed on&nbsp;Sancho in the iſland of Barataria. He thought one&nbsp;part of the people looked upon him as like Lazarille of&nbsp;Tormes, who, being fixed to the bottom of a tub, with&nbsp;only his head out of the water, was carried from one&nbsp;town to another to amuſe the vulgar. But theſe wrong&nbsp;and whimſical ideas did not prevent him from aſpiring&nbsp;after a reſidence in Paris, where, without doubt, he was&nbsp;more looked on as a ſpectacle than in any other place&nbsp;whatever. On the ill July 1770, Rouſſeau appeared,&nbsp;for the firſt time, at the regency coffee-houſe, dreſſed&nbsp;in ordinary clothing, having for ſome time previous&nbsp;to this wore an Armenian habit. He was loaded&nbsp;with praiſes by the ſurrounding multitude. “ It is&nbsp;ſomewhat ſingular (ſays M. Sennebier) to ſee a man ſo&nbsp;haughty as he returning to the very place from whence&nbsp;he had been baniſhed ſo often. Nor is it one of the&nbsp;ſmalleſt inconſiſtencies of this extraordinary character,&nbsp;that he preferred a retreat in that place of which he&nbsp;had ſpoken ſo much ill.” It is as ſingular that a perſon under ſentence of impriſonment ſhould wiſh to live&nbsp;in ſo public a manner in the very place where his ſentence was in force againſt him. His friends procured&nbsp;for him, however, liberty of ſtaying, on condition that&nbsp;he ſhould neither write on religion nor politics : he kept&nbsp;his word ; ſor he wrote none at all. He was contented&nbsp;with living in a calm philoſophical manner, giving himſelf to the ſociety of a few tried friends, ſhunning the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
