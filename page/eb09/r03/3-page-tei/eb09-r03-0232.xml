            <p>Christians, and it is alleged by Armenian writers that he had been brought up and
                baptized among the Russians.</p>
            <p>Rubruk and his party landed at Soldaia, or Sûdàk, on the Crimean eoast, a port which
                was then the chief seat of the communication between the Mediterranean states and
                what is now southern Russia. Equipped with horses and carts for the steppe, they
                travelled successively to the courts of Sartak and of Batû, respectively on the
                hither and further banks of the Volga, bandied from one to the other, and then
                referred to the Great Khan himself, an order involving the enormous journey to
                Mongolia. The actual travelling of the party from the Crimea to the khan’s
                court near Karakorum cannot have been, on a rough calculation, less than 5000 miles,
                and the return journey to Ayas in Cilicia would be longer by 500 to 700 miles. The
                chief dates to be gathered from the narrative are as follows :—embark on the Euxine,
                May 7, 1253 ; reach Soldaia, 21 ; set out thence, June 1 ; reach camp of
                Sartak, July 31 ; begin journey from camp of Bâtû eastward across steppe, September
                16 ; turn south-east, November 1 ; reach Talas river, 8 ; leave Cailac@@<hi
                    rend="sup">1</hi> (south of Lake Balkash), 30 ; reach camp of Great Khan,
                December 27 ; leave camp of Great Khan on or about July 10, 1254 ; reach camp of
                Bâtû again, September 16 ; leave Sartak’s camp, November 1 ; at the Iron Gate
                (Derbend) 13 ; Christmas spent at Nakhshivan (under Ararat) ; reach Antioch (from
                    Ayas,<hi rend="italic">via</hi> Cyprus), June 29, 1255 ; reach Tripoli, August
                15.</p>
            <p>The camp of Batn was reached near the northernmost point of his summer marches,
                therefore about Ukek near Saratoff (see <hi rend="italic">Marco Polo,</hi> Prol.,
                chap. iii. note 4). Before the camp was left they had marched with it five weeks
                down the Volga. The point of departure would lie on that river somewhere between 48°
                and 50° N. lat. The route taken lay eastward by a line running north of the Caspian
                and Aral basins ; then from about 70° E. long, south (with some easting) to the
                basin of the Talas river ; thence across the passes of the Kirghiz Ala-tau and south
                of the Balkash Lake to the Ala-kul and the Baratula Lake (Ebi-nûr). From this
                the travellers struck north across the Barluk, or the Orkochuk Mountains, and
                thence, passing south of the modern Kobdo, to the valley of the Jabkan river, whence
                they emerged on the plain of Mongolia, coming upon the Great Khan’s camp at a spot
                ten days’ journey from Karakorum and bearing in the main south from that place, with
                the Khangai Mountains between.</p>
            <p>This route is of course not thus defined in the narrative, but is a laborious
                deduction from the facts stated therein. The key to the whole is the description
                given of that central portion intervening between the basin of the Talas and the
                Lake Ala-kul, which enables the topography of that region, including the passage of
                the Hi, the plain south of the Balkash, and the Ala-kul itself, to be identified
                past question.@@<hi rend="sup">2</hi></p>
            <p>The return journey, being made in summer, after retraversing the Jabkan valley,@@<hi
                    rend="sup">3</hi> lay much farther to the north, and passed north of the
                Balkash, with a tolerably straight course probably, to the mouths of the Volga.
                Thence the party travelled south by Derbend, and so by Shamakhi to the Araxes,
                Nakhshivan, Erzingan, Sivas, and Iconium, to the coast of Cilicia, and eventually to
                the port of Ayas, where they embarked for Cyprus and Syria. St Louis had returned to
                France a year before.</p>
            <p>We have alluded to Roger Bacon’s mention of Friar William of Rubruk. Indeed, in the
                geographical section of the <hi rend="italic">Opus Majus </hi>(c. 1262) he cites the
                traveller repeatedly and copiously, describing him as “frater Wilhelmus quem dominus
                rex Franciae misit ad Tartaros, Anno Domini 1253 .... qui perlustravit
                regiones orientis et aquilonis et Ioca in medio his annexa, et scripsit
                haec praedicta illustri régi ; quem Iibrum diligenter vidi et cum ejus auctore
                contuli” <hi rend="italic">(Opus Majus,</hi> ed. Jebb, 1733, pp. 190-191). Add to
                this William’s own incidental particular as to his being (like his precursor, Friar
                John of Pian Carpine, see vol. v. p. 132) a very heavy man <hi rend="italic"
                    >(ponderosus valde),</hi> and we know no more of his personality except the
                abundant indications of character afforded by the story itself. These paint for us
                an honest, pious, stouthearted, acute, and most intelligent observer, keen in the
                acquisition of knowledge, the author in fact of one of the best narratives of travel
                in existence. His language indeed is Latin of the most un-Ciceronian
                quality,—dog-Latin we fear it must be called ; but, call it what we may, it is in
                his hands a pithy and transparent medium of expression. In spite of all the
                difficulties of communi-</p>
            <p>cation, and of the badness of his <hi rend="italic">turgcmannus</hi> or
                    dragoman,@@<hi rend="sup">4</hi> he gathered a mass of particulars, wonderfully
                true or near the truth, not only as to Asiatic nature, geography, ethnography,
                and manners, but as to religion and language. Of his geography a good example occurs
                in his account of the Caspian (eagerly caught up by Roger Bacon), which is perfectly
                accurate, except that he places the hill country occupied by the Mulahids, or
                Assassins, on the eastern instead of the southern shore. He explicitly corrects the
                allegation of Isidore that it is a gulf of the ocean : “ non est</p>
            <p>verum quod dicit Ysidorus.....nusquam enim tangit oceanum,</p>
            <p>sed undique circumdatur terra ” (265).@@<hi rend="sup">5</hi> Of his interest and
                acumen in matters of language we may cite examples. The language of the Pascatir (or
                Bashkirds) and of the Hungarians is the same, as he had learned from Dominicans who
                had been among them (274).@@<hi rend="sup">6 </hi>The language of the Ruthenians,
                Poles, Bohemians, and Slavonians is one, and is the same with that of the Wandals,
                or Wends (275). In the town of Equius (immediately beyond the Ili,
                    perhaps Aspara)@@<hi rend="sup">7</hi> the people were Mohammedans speaking
                Persian, though so far remote from Persia (281). The Yugurs (or Uigurs) of
                the country about Cailac (see note above) had formed a language and character of
                their own, and in that language and character the Nestorians of that tract used to
                perform their office and write their books’ (281-2). The Yugurs are those among whom
                are found the fountain and root of the Turkish and Comanian tongue (289). Their
                character has been adopted by the Moghals. In using it they begin writing from the
                top and write downwards, whilst line follows line from left to right (286). The
                Nestorians say their service, and have their holy books, in Syriac, but know nothing
                of the language, just as some of our monks sing the mass without knowing Latin
                (293). The Tibet people write as we do, and their letters have a strong resemblance
                to ours. The Tangut people write from right to left like the Arabs, and their
                lines advance upwards (329). The current money of Cathay is of cotton paper, a palm
                in length and breadth, and on this they print lines like those of Mangu Khan’s<hi
                    rend="italic">seal :—<hi rend="sup">(i</hi> imprimunt lineas</hi> sicut
                est Sigillum Mangu ”—a remarkable expression. They write with a painter’s pencil and
                combine in one character several letters, forming one expression :—“ faciunt in una
                figura plures Iiteras compre-Iiendentes unam dictionem,”—a still more remarkable
                utterance, showing an approximate apprehension of the nature of Chinese writing
                (329).</p>
            <p>Yet this sagacious and honest observer is denounced as an ignorant and untruthful
                blunderer by Isaac Jacob Schmidt (a man no doubt of useful learning, of a kind rare
                in his day, but narrow and wrong-headed, and in natural acumen and candour far
                inferior to the 13th-century friar whom he maligns), simply because the evidence of
                the latter as to the Turkish dialect of the Uigurs traversed a pet heresy, long
                since exploded, which Schmidt entertained, viz., that the Uigurs were by race and
                language Tibetan.@@<hi rend="sup">8</hi></p>
            <p>The narrative of Rubruk, after Roger Bacon’s copious use of it, seems to have dropped
                out of sight. It has no place in the famous collections of the 14th century, nor in
                the earlier <hi rend="italic">Speculum Historiale</hi> of Vincent of Beauvais,
                which gives so many others of the Tartarian ecclesiastical itineraries. It first
                appeared imperfectly in Hakluyt (1600), as we have mentioned. But it was not till
                1839 that any proper edition of the text was published. In that year the <hi
                    rend="italic">Recueil de Voyages</hi> of the Paris Geographical Society, vol.
                iv., contained a thorough edition of the Latin text, and a collation of the few
                existing MSS., put forth by M. D'Avezac, with the assistance of two young scholars,
                since of high distinction, viz., Francisque-Michel and Thomas Wright. But there is
                no commentary, such as M. D’Avezac attached, in his own Incomparablefashion, to the
                edition of Friar John of Pian Carpine in the same volume ; nor has there ever been
                any properly annotated edition of a traveller so worthy of honour. Richthofen in his
                    <hi rend="italic">China, </hi>i. 602-604, has briefly but justly noticed the
                narrative of Rubruk. A French version with some notes, issued at Paris in 1877, in
                the <hi rend="italic">Bibliothèque Orientale Elzevirienne,</hi> if named at all, can
                only be mentioned as beneath contempt. The task is one which the present writer has
                long contemplated, but now with but slender hope of accomplishment. (Since this was
                in type the writer has received from Dr. Franz Max Schmidt an admirable monograph by
                him, <hi rend="italic">Ueber Rubruk’s Reise</hi> (Berlin, p. 93), extracted from
                vol. xx. of the <hi rend="italic">Ztschr. Geog. Soc. Berl.,</hi> and has greatly
                profited by it in the revision of the article in proof.)    (H. Y.)</p>
            <p>RUBY. This name is applied by lapidaries and jewellers to two distinct minerals,
                which may be distinguished as the true or Oriental ruby and the spinel ruby.
                The former is a red variety of corundum or native alumina, of</p>

                the historians of the Mongols, the position of which is somewhat indefinite.
                The narrative of Rubruk shows that it must have been near the modern Kopal.</p>

                ccxi.-ccxiv., and Schuyler’s <hi rend="italic">Turkistan,</hi> i. 402-405. Mr
                Schuyler points out the true identification of Rubruk’s river with the Hi, instead
                of the Ctiu, which is a much smaller stream ; and other amendments have been derived
                from Dr F. M. Schmidt (see below).</p>
            <p>@@@    So the present writer interprets what Rubruk says :—“ Our going was in winter,
                our return in summer, and that by a way lying very much farther north, only that for
                a space of fifteen days’ journey in going and coming we followed a certain river
                between mountains, and on these there was no grass to be found except close to the
                river.” The position of the Chagan Takoi or upper Jabkan seems to suit these facts
                best ; but Mr Schuyler refers them to the upper Irtish, and Dr F. Schmidt to the
                UHungur.</p>
