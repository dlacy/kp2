<p><label>REFLECTION OF LIGHT</label>
. When a ray of light in a homogeneous medium falls upon the bounding surface of another medium, part of it is usually turned back or reflected and part is scattered, the remainder traversing or being absorbed by the second medium. The scattered rays (also termed the irregularly or diffusely reflected rays) play an important part in rendering objects visible—in fact, without diffuse reflection non-luminous objects would be invisible; they are occasioned by irregularities in the surface, but are governed by the same law as holds for regular reflection. This law is: the incident and reflected rays make equal angles with the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence, and are coplanar with the normal. This is equivalent to saying that the path of the ray is a minimum. <note anchored="true" place="bottom" type="authorial" n="1"> This principle of the minimum path, however, only holds for plane and convex surfaces; with concave surfaces it may be a maximum in certain cases. </note> In fig. 1 , MN represents the section of a plane mirror; OR is the incident ray, RP the reflected ray,</p><p>and TR the normal at R. Then</p><p>the law states that the angle of</p><p>incidence ORT equals the angle</p><p>of reflection PRT, and that</p><p>OR, RT and RP are in the same</p><p>plane.</p><p>This natural law is capable of ready experimental proof (a simple one is to take the altitude of a star with a meridian circle, its depression in a horizontal reflecting surface of mercury and the direction of the nadir), and the most delicate instruments have failed to detect any divergence from it. Its explanation by the Newtonian corpuscular theory is very simple, for we have only to assume that at the point of impact the perpendicular velocity of a corpuscle is reversed, whilst the horizontal velocity is unchanged (the mirror being assumed horizontal). The wave-theory explanation is more complicated, and in the simple form given by Huygens incomplete. The theory as developed by Fresnel shows that regular reflection is due to a small zone in the neighbourhood of the point R (above), there being destructive interference at all other points on the mirror; this theory also accounts for the polarization of the reflected light when incident at a certain angle (see Polarization of Light). The smoothness or polish of the surface largely controls the reflecting power, for, obviously, crests and furrows, if of sufficient magnitude, disturb the phase relations. The permissible deviation from smoothness depends on the wave-length of the light employed: it appears that surfaces smooth to within ⅛th of a wave-length reflect regularly; hence long waves may be regularly reflected by a surface which diffuses short waves. Also the obliquity of the incidence would diminish the effect of any irregularities; this is experi-mentally confirmed by observing the images produced by matt surfaces or by smoked glass at grazing incidence.</p><p>We now give some elementary constructions of reflected rays, or, what comes to the same thing, of images formed by mirrors.</p><p>1. If O be a luminous point and OR a ray incident at R on the plane mirror MN (fig. 1) to determine the reflected ray and the image of O. If RP be the reflected ray and RT perpendicular</p>
<pb xml:id="eb11-23-r01-0003" facs="encyclopaediabri23chisrich_0022.jp2"/><p>to MN, then, by the law of reflection, angle ORT = TRP or ORM=PRN. Hence draw OQ perpendicular to MN, and produce it to S, making QS = OQ; join SR and produce to P. It is easily seen that PR and OR are equally indined to RT (or MN). A point-eye at P would see a point object O at S, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> at a distance below the mirror equal to its height above. If the object be a solid, then the images of its corners are formed by taking points at the same distances below as the corners are above the mirror, and joining these points. The eye, however, sees the image ρer-verted, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> , in the same relation as the left hand to the right. Fig. 2 shows how an extended object is viewed in a mirror by a natural</p><p>eye.</p><p>2. If A, B be two parallel plane mirrors and O a luminous point between them (fig. 3) to determine the images of O all the</p><p>images must lie on the line (produced) PQ passing through O and perpendicular to the mirrors. Let OP = <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> OQ = <hi rend="italic">q.</hi> Then if O' be the image of O in A, OO' <hi rend="italic">= 2p</hi> ; now O' has an image O" in B, such that OO"= OQ+QO" <hi rend="italic">= q+q+2p = 2p+2q</hi> ; similarly O" has an image O <hi rend="italic">'''</hi> in A, such that OO'''=4 <hi rend="italic">p</hi> +2 <hi rend="italic">q</hi> . In the same way O forms an image O <hi rend="sub">1</hi> in B such that OO <hi rend="sub">1</hi> <hi rend="italic">=</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">q</hi> ; O <hi rend="sub">1</hi> has an image O <hi rend="sub">11</hi> in A, such that OO <hi rend="sub">11</hi> =2 <hi rend="italic">p+</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">q</hi> ; O <hi rend="sub">11</hi> has an image O <hi rend="sub">111</hi> in B, such that OO <hi rend="sub">111</hi> =2 <hi rend="italic">p</hi> +4 <hi rend="italic">q</hi> , and so on. Hence there are an infinite number of images at definite distances from the mirrors. This explains the vistas as seen, for example, between two parallel mirrors at the ends of a</p><p>room.</p><p>3. If A, B be two plane mirrors inclined at an angle <hi rend="italic">θ,</hi> and intersecting at C, and O a luminous point between them, determine the position and number of images.</p><p>Call are OA = α, OB <hi rend="italic">=β.</hi> The image of O in A, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> α <hi rend="italic">'</hi> , is such that Oα <hi rend="italic">'</hi> is perpendicular to CA, and Oα <hi rend="italic">'</hi> = 2α. Also Cα <hi rend="italic">'</hi> = CO; and it is easily seen that all the images lie on a circle of centre C and radius CO. The image <hi rend="italic">α'</hi> forms an image α <hi rend="italic">"</hi> in B such that O <hi rend="italic">α"</hi> = OB + B <hi rend="italic">α"</hi> = <hi rend="italic">β+</hi> B <hi rend="italic">α'</hi> = <hi rend="italic">β+</hi> OB+O <hi rend="italic">α'</hi> =2 <hi rend="italic">β+</hi> 2 <hi rend="italic">α</hi> = 2 <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> . Also <hi rend="italic">α"</hi> forms an image <hi rend="italic">α'''</hi> in A such that O <hi rend="italic">a'"</hi> =OA+A <hi rend="italic">α'</hi> = 2 <hi rend="italic">α</hi> +2 <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> . And generally O <hi rend="italic">α <hi rend="sup">2n</hi></hi> = 2 <hi rend="italic">nθ</hi> , O <hi rend="italic">α <hi rend="sup">2n+1</hi></hi> = 2 <hi rend="italic">nθ</hi> +2 <hi rend="italic">α</hi> . In the same way it can be shown that the image first formed in B gives foci of the general distances: <hi rend="italic">Ob <hi rend="sup">2n</hi> = 2nθ, Ob <hi rend="sup">2n+l</hi> = 2nθ+2β.</hi> The number of images is limited, for when any one falls on the are <hi rend="italic">ab</hi> between the mirrors produced, it lies behind both mirrors, and hence no further image is possible. Suppose <hi rend="italic">α <hi rend="sup">2n</hi></hi> be the first image to fall on this arc, then are O <hi rend="italic">α <hi rend="sup">2n</hi></hi> &gt;OB <hi rend="italic">α</hi> , <hi rend="italic">i.e. 2nθ&gt;π-a</hi> or 2n&gt; ( <hi rend="italic">π-a</hi> )∕ <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> . Similarly if α <hi rend="sup">2n+1</hi> be the first to fall on <hi rend="italic">ab,</hi> we obtain 2n+1&gt; (π- <hi rend="italic">α</hi> )∕ <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> . Hence in both cases the number of images is the integer next greater than <hi rend="italic">(π-a)∕θ.</hi> In the same way it can be shown that the number of images of the <hi rend="italic">b</hi> series is the integer next greater than (π- <hi rend="italic">β)∕θ.</hi> If π/ <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> be an integer, then the number of images of each series is π <hi rend="italic">∣</hi> <hi rend="italic">θ,</hi> for <hi rend="italic">α∕θ</hi> and <hi rend="italic">β∕θ</hi> are proper fractions. But an image of each series coincides; for if π <hi rend="italic">∕θ=2n,</hi> we have O <hi rend="italic">a <hi rend="sup">2n</hi></hi> +O <hi rend="italic">b <hi rend="sup">2n</hi> = 2nθ+2nθ = 2π i.e. a <hi rend="sup">2n</hi></hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> <hi rend="sup">2n</hi> coincide; and if π∕ <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> = 2 <hi rend="italic">n</hi> +1, we have Oα <hi rend="sup">2n+1</hi> + O <hi rend="italic">b</hi> <hi rend="sup">2n+1</hi> = 4nθ+2( <hi rend="italic">α</hi> + <hi rend="italic">β</hi> ) = (4 <hi rend="italic">n+</hi> 2) <hi rend="italic">θ</hi> =2π, <hi rend="italic">i.e. α</hi> <hi rend="sup">2</hi> <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="sup"> n</hi></hi> <hi rend="sup">+1</hi> and <hi rend="italic">b</hi> <hi rend="sup">2n+1</hi> coincide. Hence the number of images, including the luminous point, is 2 <hi rend="italic">π</hi> <hi rend="italic"><hi rend="smallcaps"> ∣</hi></hi> <hi rend="italic">θ.</hi> This principle is utilized in the <hi rend="italic">kaleidoscope</hi> ( <hi rend="italic">q.v.</hi> ), which produces five images by means of its mirrors inclined at 6o°(fig. 4). Fig. 5 shows the seven images formed by mirrors inclined at 45°</p><p>4. To determine the reflection at a spherical surface. Let APB (fig. 6) be a section of a concave spherical mirror through its centre O and luminous point U. If a ray, say UP, meet the surface, it will be reflected along PV, which is coplanar with UP and the normal PO at P, and makes the angle VPO = UPO. Hence VO∕VP = OU∕UP. This expression may be simplified if we assume P to be very close to A, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> that the ray UP is very slightly inclined to the axis. Writing A for P, we have VO∕AV = OU∕AU; and calling AU= <hi rend="italic">u</hi> , AV= <hi rend="italic">v</hi> and AO = <hi rend="italic">r</hi> , this reduces to <hi rend="italic">u</hi> <hi rend="sup">-l</hi> + <hi rend="italic">v <hi rend="sup">-</hi></hi> = 2 <hi rend="italic">r</hi> <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> .</p><p>This formula connects the distances of the object and image formed by a spherical concave mirror with the radius of the mirror. Points satisfying this relation are called “ conjugate foci,” for obviously they are reciprocal, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> <hi rend="italic">u</hi> and <hi rend="italic">v</hi> can be interchanged in the formula.</p><p>lf <hi rend="italic">u</hi> be infinite, as, for example, if the luminous source be a star, then <hi rend="italic">v</hi> <hi rend="sup">-l</hi> = 2 <hi rend="italic">r</hi> <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> , <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> v = ½ <hi rend="italic">r</hi> . This value is called the focal length of</p><p>the mirror, and the corresponding point, usually denoted by F, is called the “ principal focus.” This formula requires modification for a convex mirror, If <hi rend="italic">u</hi> be always considered as positive (ν may be either positive or negative), <hi rend="italic">r</hi> must be regarded as positive with concave mirrors and negative with convex. Similarly the focal length, having the same sign as <hi rend="italic">r</hi> , has different signs in the two cases.</p><p>In this formula all distances are measured from the mirror; but it is sometimes more convenient to measure from the principal focus. If the distances of the object and image from the principal focus be <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and y, then <hi rend="italic">u=x+f</hi> and <hi rend="italic">υ=y+f</hi> (remembering that <hi rend="italic">f</hi> is positive for concave and negative for convex mirrors). Substituting these values in <hi rend="italic">u</hi> <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> + <hi rend="italic">v</hi> <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> = <hi rend="italic">f</hi> <hi rend="sup">-1</hi> and reducing we obtain <hi rend="italic">xy=f <hi rend="sup">2</hi> .</hi> Since <hi rend="italic">f <hi rend="sup">2</hi></hi> is always positive, <hi rend="italic">x</hi> and <hi rend="italic">y</hi> must have the same sign, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> the object and image must lie on the same side of the principal focus.</p><p>We now consider the production of the image of a small object placed symmetrically and perpendicular to the axis of a concave (fig. 7) and a convex mirror (fig. 8). Let PQ be the object and A the vertex of the mirror. Consider the point P. Now a ray through P and parallel to the axis after meeting the mirror at M is reflected through the focus F. The line MF must therefore contain the image of P. Also a ray through P and also through the centre of curvature C of the mirror is reflected along the same path ; this also contains the image of P. Hence the image is at P, the intersection of the lines MF and PC. Similarly the image of any other point can be found, and the final image deduced. We notice that in fig. 6 the image is inverted and real, and in fig. 7 erect and virtual. The “ magnification ” or ratio of the size of the image to the object· can be deduced from the figures by elementary geometry; it equals the ratio of the distances of the image and object from the mirror or from the centre of curvature of the mirror.</p><p>The positions and characters of the images for objects at varying</p>

This, however, no longer holds when the mirror has a wide aperture, and in general the reflected rays envelop a caustic <hi rend="italic">(q.υ.,</hi> see also Aberration). The only mirror which can sharply reproduce an object-point as an image-point has for its section an ellipse, which is so placed that the object and image are at its foci. This follows from a property of the curve, viz. the sum of the focal distances is constant, and that the focal vectores are equally inclined to the normal <hi rend="italic">at</hi> the point. More important than the elliptical mirror, however, is the parabolic, which has the property of converting rays parallel to the axis into a</p><p>pencil through its focus; or, inversely, rays from a source placed at the focus are converted into a parallel beam; hence the use of this mirror in search-lights and similar devices.</p>
