<p><span class="font0">Lansdowne. He said that, notwithstanding the declaration made, in both cases, of his being totally unfettered, yet he&nbsp;never could feel real independence while he thus held his&nbsp;place in the Commons by favour ; and, he adds, “ I formed&nbsp;to myself an unalterable resolution, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">never,</span><span class="font0"> unless I held a&nbsp;public office, to come into parliament but by a popular&nbsp;election, or by paying the common price for my seat. As&nbsp;to the first of these, I knew, of course, that I must never&nbsp;look for it; and as for the latter, I determined to wait till&nbsp;the labours of my profession should have enabled me to accomplish it without being guilty of any great extravagance.”&nbsp;He was soon rewarded for the scrupulous feeling of honour&nbsp;which had thus forced him to decline a place, that held out&nbsp;to him, as he confesses, very strong temptations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In February 1806, he was appointed Solicitor General under the government of Mr Fox and Lord Grenville,&nbsp;with neither of whom had he previously any connexion.&nbsp;He was obliged, much against his will, to accept the honour&nbsp;of knighthood, and was elected to represent the borough of&nbsp;Qneenborough, accepting this seat, without scruple, from the&nbsp;government. “ If I had come in,” says he, “ as a private&nbsp;individual, I would not have accepted a seat from any body ;&nbsp;but as long as I hold the office to which I have been appointed, I must support the administration. As soon as they appear to me unworthy to be supported, it will be my duty to&nbsp;resign.” Of the public life which commenced under these&nbsp;auspices, and was prematurely brought to a close in thirteen&nbsp;years, Sir Samuel Romilly kept a minute and faithful diary,&nbsp;the contents of which have lately been made known to the&nbsp;world. No existing record of a political career presents&nbsp;a purer picture than does this ;—the history of a course of&nbsp;public conduct directed invariably by those qualities of&nbsp;mind and heart which we have, even in this hasty sketch,&nbsp;seen to have guided the earlier years spent in his family&nbsp;and in his profession. It is impossible to embrace, within&nbsp;these limits, so much as a catalogue of the parliamentary&nbsp;measures in which he took a share, in the way of inciting&nbsp;others to action, in the way of himself acting and speaking&nbsp;and writing in favour of reforms in the laws and constitution,&nbsp;in the way of resisting encroachments on public rights or on&nbsp;just economical principles. And if a selection were to be&nbsp;attempted of a few of his principal public acts, that selection&nbsp;could not be made without omitting many which, in particular views, might be considered more important than those&nbsp;that would be specified.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the design which lay closest to Romilly’s heart, and occupied most of the energies of his capacious intellect, was&nbsp;the amelioration of the law of England, especially in its&nbsp;criminal sections. For such plans his official duties, added&nbsp;to those of his profession and of his place in parliament,&nbsp;allowed him at first no leisure; but from some of these&nbsp;trammels he was speedily released, by the fall of the Whig&nbsp;ministry in March 1807. In the new parliament he was&nbsp;returned for Horsham, on the Duke of Norfolk’s interest, engaging to pay L.2000 for his seat if he should be able to&nbsp;keep it in spite of a petition, which was expected to be&nbsp;presented in consequence of doubts entertained as to the&nbsp;qualification of many of the voters. The petition proved&nbsp;successful, and his next election was made on terms equally&nbsp;characteristic. A seat was offered him for Wareham, for&nbsp;which, although L.3000 were demanded, he was asked to pay&nbsp;but L.2000, the remaining L.1000 being promised from a&nbsp;fund subscribed for extraordinary purposes by the leaders&nbsp;of the opposition. Romilly peremptorily refused to be indebted even to the public men with whom he systematically&nbsp;acted. He accepted the seat, but paid the whole price&nbsp;himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">He now occupied a very prominent position in parliament. The eyes of the most liberally organized constituencies in&nbsp;the country were directed towards him ; and in 1811, when a&nbsp;dissolution was impending, it was proposed in several such&nbsp;places to put him up as a candidate. For Liverpool, which&nbsp;was one of these, he at once refused to stand, on account&nbsp;of the disturbances which the contest was sure to occasion.&nbsp;In regard to the county of Middlesex, a negotiation was attempted by Major Cartwright, which was frustrated by Sir&nbsp;Samuel’s flatly refusing to give, before his nomination, a&nbsp;pledge in favour of annual parliaments, and of such reform&nbsp;as should make the suffrage co-extensive with the taxation.&nbsp;He however accepted a requisition from Bristol, but was&nbsp;defeated by a coalition between the Tories and a section of&nbsp;the Whigs. He then obtained a seat for Arundel, on the&nbsp;interest of the Duke of Norfolk, an assurance of perfect independence being given him by the patron, but no price&nbsp;being paid on this occasion. Romilly’s justification of his&nbsp;change of views is very briefly stated in his diary. His&nbsp;known course in parliament protected him, as he thought,&nbsp;from being either required by his patron to be subservient,&nbsp;or suspected by the public of really being so ; and therefore&nbsp;he could safely do that which, by a change of the law, it had&nbsp;now become necessary for him to do if he wished for a seat&nbsp;at all. “ Since Curwen’s bill,” says he, “ has declared illegal&nbsp;the purchase of seats in the manner which was formerly&nbsp;practised, there is no choice for a person like myself, but to&nbsp;come into parliament upon such an offer as is now made&nbsp;me, or to decline parliament altogether. And I cannot&nbsp;think that it is my duty to decline it.” This seat Romilly held&nbsp;till the dissolution in 1818, when he accepted a requisition&nbsp;from electors in Westminster, upon which a severe contest&nbsp;ensued. One of the two vacant seats was considered as&nbsp;sure for Sir Francis Burdett ; the return of Romilly for the&nbsp;other was opposed not only by a ministerial candidate, but&nbsp;by Hunt, Cartwright, and Douglas Kinnaird. Romilly and&nbsp;Burdett were returned, the former standing at the head of&nbsp;the poll from its opening till its close.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The results to which this great victory was expected to have led, were unfortunately never realized. Romilly had&nbsp;a constitutional tendency to hypochondria, or at least to&nbsp;lowness of spirits, which his continual labour both of body&nbsp;and mind prevented for years from reaching a dangerous&nbsp;height, although perhaps this very labour it was, that at length&nbsp;caused the overwrought organism to fall suddenly to pieces.&nbsp;The health of his wife, whom he idolized rather than loved,&nbsp;had for some time caused him serious uneasiness : she became alarmingly unwell. Soon after his election for Westminster, on the 10th of October, he closed abruptly those&nbsp;brief notices of her illness which had lately been the only&nbsp;entries in his diary ; and on the 29th of that month she&nbsp;died at Cowes. Her husband travelled to town, labouring,&nbsp;during his journey, or at any rate after it, under an inflammatory fever ; and in one of its paroxysms he put an end to&nbsp;his existence, three days after the death of his wife. He&nbsp;died on the 2d of November 1818, when he had nearly&nbsp;completed the sixty-second year of his age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The public character of Sir Samuel Romilly would be best drawn by a few warm and vigorous strokes, all of which,&nbsp;with no exception worth noticing, would convey images of&nbsp;distinguished excellence. These traits would exhibit his&nbsp;manly and ratiocinative oratory, lighted up into eloquence&nbsp;by the fervour of his moral sense,—the consummate capacity, integrity, and knowledge of the law, and the comprehensive and philanthropic views of legislation, which made&nbsp;it a national misfortune for England that he never became&nbsp;one of her chancellors,—that antique spirit of mental independence, which bowed to the demands of no man, and of no&nbsp;party, not even his own, unless his conscience told him that&nbsp;those demands were just. And these virtues of the statesman and the jurisconsult, which, by their stern majesty, commanded from those that viewed them at a distance an awe&nbsp;not altogether unmingled with fear, were tempered in private&nbsp;life by the warmest and kindest feeling, by the most felicitous union of public labours with personal accomplishments.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
