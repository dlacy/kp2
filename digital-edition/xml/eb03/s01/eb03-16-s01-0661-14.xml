 in botany: A genus of the gymnoſpermia order, belonging to the didynamia claſs of plants; and in the natural method ranking under the 42d order, <hi rend="italic">Verticillatae.</hi> The ſegments of the corolla are nearly equal; the ſtamina ſtanding aſunder.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Species.</hi> I. The hortenſis, or ſummer favory, is an annual plant, which grows naturally in the ſouth of France and Italy, but is cultivated in this country both for the kitchen and medicinal uſe. 2. The montana, or winter ſavory, is a perennial plant growing naturally in the ſouth of France and Italy, but is cultivated in gardens both for culinary and medicinal purpoſes.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Culture.</hi> Both kinds are propagated by ſeeds. Thoſe of the firſt kind ſhould be ſown in the beginning of April upon a bed of light earth, either where they are to remain, or for tranſplanting. If the plants are to ſtand unremoved, they ſhould be ſown thinly; but if they are to be tranſplanted, they may be ſown cloſer. The ſecond ſpecies may be ſown upon a poor dry ſoil, where the plants will endure the ſevereſt winters, though they are often killed by the froſt when planted in good ground. The plants will continue ſeveral years; but when they are old, the ſhoots will be ſhot and not ſo well furniſhed with leaves; it will therefore be proper to raiſe a ſupply of young plants every year.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Uſes.</hi> Summer ſavory is a very warm pungent aromatic; and affords in diſtillation with water a ſubtile eſſential oil, of a penetrating ſmall, and very hot acrid taſte. It yields little of its virtues by infuſion to aqueous liquors; rectified ſpirit extracts the whole oſ its taſte and ſmell, and elevates nothing in diſtillation.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
