<p><label>RAZOR</label>
(O.F. <hi rend="italic">rasor,</hi> mod. <hi rend="italic">rasÎ¿ir,</hi> from <hi rend="italic">raser</hi> , to scrape, rase, Late Lat. <hi rend="italic">rasare,</hi> frequentative of <hi rend="italic">radere,</hi> to scrape), a sharp-edged cutting instrument, used for shaving the hair and beard. The typical razor consists of a blade, usually curving slightly backward, folding into a handle, to which it is fastened by a tang and rivet. The back of the blade is thick and the sides are hollowed or slope to the fine edge (see Cutlery). In modem times various forms of safety-razor have been invented, in which the blade fits into a fixed handle with a toothed or comb-like shield which protects the face from cutting.</p>
