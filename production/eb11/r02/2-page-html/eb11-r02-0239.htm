<p><span class="font0">We note in the rhyolites I.-III. the very high silica, with alkalis and alumina also in considerable amount, while lime, magnesia and&nbsp;iron are very low. In the pantellarite, keratophyre and comendite&nbsp;the silica tends to be less abundant, while the alkalis, especially&nbsp;soda, increase; they have less alumina but are richer in iron and&nbsp;magnesia, lt is easy to see why the latter types contain less quartz,&nbsp;felspars often very rich in soda, and femic minerals which contain&nbsp;iron and alkalis in notable amounts such as aegirine, riebeckite and&nbsp;arfvedsonite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0· S.

<p><span class="font1">RHYTHM (Greek </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ρυθμός,</span><span class="font1"> from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ρ£ν,</span><span class="font1"> to flow), the measured flow of movement, or beat, in verse, music or by analogy in&nbsp;other connexions, e.g. “ rhythm of life.” The early critic of&nbsp;prosody, Aristoxenus, distinguished as the three elements out of&nbsp;which rhythm is composed, the spoken word, λέξ«, the tune of&nbsp;music and song, μέλοί, and the bodily motion, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">κίνησιχ σωματική.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The art of the early Greek poets was devoted to Î harmonious combination of these three elements, language,&nbsp;instrument and gesture uniting to form perfect rhythm. Aris-toxenus proceeds to define the rhythm so produced as an arrangement of time-periods, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">τόξιν χρόνων,</span><span class="font1"> but other early theorists&nbsp;make not the time but the syllable the measurement of poetic&nbsp;speech. Both music and poetry depend, and have depended&nbsp;from the earliest times, on rhythm. But in music melody and&nbsp;harmony have to be taken into consideration, whereas in poetry&nbsp;the rhythmical value of the tone is modified by the imaginative&nbsp;value and importance of the words themselves. In earliest&nbsp;times the fundamental unity of the two arts was constantly&nbsp;manifest, but as the world has progressed, and they have&nbsp;ramified into countless forms, the difference between them has&nbsp;been emphasized more and more.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rhythm in Verse.—</span><span class="font1">Professor Jakob Minor has adduced a figure, valuable in helping us to realize what poetic rhythm&nbsp;is, when he remarks that to strike a bell twelve times,&nbsp;at exactly equal intervals, is to produce what may be called,&nbsp;indeed, a rhythmic effect, but not to awaken anything&nbsp;resembling the sensation of poetical rhythm. Into the idea&nbsp;of poetic rhythm enters an element of life, of pulse, of a&nbsp;certain inequality of time based upon an equality of tone.&nbsp;Rhythm ceases to be poetic rhythm if it is mechanical or&nbsp;lifeless. Aristotle, from whom a definition might be expected, is very vague in dealing with the subject, and most&nbsp;of the old rhetorical writers darken counsel with statements&nbsp;that are obscure or irrational. The fact is that rhythm&nbsp;is an expression of the instinct for order in sound which&nbsp;naturally governs the human ear, and little practical knowledge is gained by following Suidas when he says that rhythm&nbsp;is the father of metre, or Quintilian in his epigram that&nbsp;rhythm is male and metre is female. These definitions arise&nbsp;from a rhetorical desire to measure a delicate instinct by&nbsp;rule of three, and, as a matter of fact, Greek criticism on&nbsp;this subject often lost itself in arithmetical absurdities.&nbsp;It is sufficient to say that rhythm is the law which governs&nbsp;the even and periodical progress of sounds, in harmony&nbsp;with the exigencies of human emotion. For the passions,&nbsp;as expressed in verse, various movements are appropriate.&nbsp;Joy demands that the voice should leap and sing; sorrow&nbsp;that it should move solemnly and slowly; and poetry, which&nbsp;is founded on rhythm, requires that the movement of words&nbsp;should respond to this instinctive gradation of sounds. The&nbsp;finer the genius of the metrist the more exquisitely does his&nbsp;rhythm convey, as upon an instrument, the nature of the&nbsp;passion which burdens his verses. Ecstasy takes a quick,&nbsp;eager, rising movement;—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ Give him the nectar!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pour out for the poet,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hebe, pour free!</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Quicken his eyes with celestial dew,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That Styx the detested no more he may view.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Mystery and suspense demand a faint, languid and throbbing movement:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ There is not wind enough in the air To move away the ringlet curl&nbsp;From the lovely lady’s cheek—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is not wind enough to twirl The one red leaf, the last of its clan,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">That dances as often as dance it can.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">An overpowering sadness interprets itself in rhythm that is full and slow and emphatic;—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“My genial spirits fail,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And what can these avail</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To lift the smothering weight from off my breast?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It were a vain endeavour,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Though I should gaze for ever</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On that green light that lingers in the west:</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">I may not hope from outward forms to win</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The passion ana the life, whose fountains are within.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rhythm so produced, intimately linked, almost beyond the disintegrating power of analysis, with human feeling, may&nbsp;depend either on </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">accentuation</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">quantity.</span><span class="font1"> The latter forms the&nbsp;principle upon which all classic metre was composed, while the&nbsp;former is dominant in nearly every description of modem verse.&nbsp;Greek and Latin verse depends entirely upon the relation of&nbsp;syllables, long or short. It was a question of time with the&nbsp;ancients, of stress or weight with us. It is an error to say, as is&nbsp;often done, that ancient verse did not recognize accent, and that&nbsp;in modern verse there is no place for quantity. These statements are generally true, hut there are various exceptions to&nbsp;both rules. Schiffer, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Englische Metrik,</span><span class="font1"> specially points&nbsp;out that “ long and short syllables have no constant length, no&nbsp;constant relation, but they depend on their place in the verse,&nbsp;and on the context; though they do not determine the rhythm&nbsp;of verse, they still act as regulators of our metre in a very important degree.” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pauses</span><span class="font1"> take an essential importance in the&nbsp;construction of modern rhythm, of the variety and vitality of&nbsp;which they are the basis. They are introduced for the purpose&nbsp;of relieving the monotony of successive equal groups of syllables.&nbsp;The pause often takes the place of a light syllable, and there are&nbsp;instances in the verse of Shakespeare and Milton where it is even&nbsp;allowed to fill up the space of a heavy syllable. But still more&nbsp;often the pause does not imply the dropping of a syllable at&nbsp;all, but simply dictates a break in the sound, equivalent to a&nbsp;break in the sense. The following extract from a “ Psalm ” in&nbsp;Crashaw’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Steps to the Temple {1646},</span><span class="font1"> in which the pauses&nbsp;are numerous and energetic, will exemplify the variety of this&nbsp;artifice:—</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ On the proud banks of great Euphrates’ flood, |</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There we sate | and there we wept : |</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Our harps | that | now | no music understood, |</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nodding | on the willows slept |</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">While I unhappy captiv’d | we Lovely Sion | thought on tnee.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the blank verse of Milton the free use of pauses constitutes the principal element in the amazing metrical art of the poet,&nbsp;and is the source of the sublime originality of his music. In&nbsp;speaking of rhythm, it is customary to think of the formal rules&nbsp;which govern the fixed cadence of feet in poetry, but there is also&nbsp;a rhythm in prose, which imitates the measured movements of the&nbsp;body in stately speech. According to Renan, the rhythm of&nbsp;the ancient poetry of the Hebrews is solely founded on this prose&nbsp;movement, which differs, in fact, from that of modem European&nbsp;poetry merely in its undefined and indeterminate character.</span></p>
