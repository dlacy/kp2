<p><span class="font0">But in the Middle Ages this was removed and replaced by the turrets which remain still. Contemporaneously&nbsp;with the arch was built the beautiful bridge over the&nbsp;Marecchia, the only other ancient monument to be found&nbsp;in Rimini, since of the amphitheatre scarcely a stone is&nbsp;left.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the AIiddle Ages the history of Rimini has no importance. Alternately captured by Byzantines and&nbsp;Goths, it was rigorously besieged by the latter in 538&nbsp;A.D. They were, however, compelled to retreat before the&nbsp;reinforcements sent by Belisarius and Narses ; thus the&nbsp;Byzantines, after various vicissitudes, became masters of&nbsp;the town, appointed a duke as its governor, and included&nbsp;it in the exarchate of Ravenna. It afterwards fell into&nbsp;the power of the Longobards, and then of the Franks, who&nbsp;yielded it to the pope, for whom it was governed by&nbsp;counts to the end of the lθth century. Soon after this&nbsp;period the imperial power became dominant in Rimini.&nbsp;In 1157 Frederick I. gave it, by imperial patent, the&nbsp;privilege of coining money and the right of self-government ; and in the 13 th century we find Rimini an independent commune waging war on the neighbouring cities.&nbsp;But throughout these times the main feature of its history&nbsp;is its alternate subjection to pope and emperor. And,&nbsp;weak as the sway of either was, it was strong enough to prevent any genuine local prosperity. During the continued&nbsp;struggle between church and empire, the withdrawal&nbsp;of the one was the signal for the other to advance, and&nbsp;these speedy mutations gave the commune no chance of&nbsp;achieving independence. This state of things went on&nbsp;until the rise of the despots, who, for similar reasons, were&nbsp;powerless to establish themselves on a firm and independent footing. Such indeed was the fate of nearly&nbsp;every city of Romagna excepting Bologna.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the year 1216 Rimini, being worsted by Cesena, adopted the desperate plan of granting citizenship to two&nbsp;members of the powerful Malatesta tribe, Giovanni and&nbsp;Malatesta, for the sake of their aid and that of their&nbsp;vassals in the defence of the state and the conduct of the&nbsp;war. This family quickly struck root in the town and&nbsp;gave birth to future tyrants; for in 1237 Giovanni was&nbsp;named podestà, and this office was the first step towards&nbsp;the sovereign power afterwards assumed by his descendants.&nbsp;Meanwhile Rimini was torn by the feuds of Guelf and&nbsp;Ghibelline. The latter were the dominant party in the&nbsp;days of Frederick IL, although very unpopular on account&nbsp;of the grievous taxes imposed by the empire. Accordingly&nbsp;the majority of the urban nobles joined the Guelfs and&nbsp;were driven into exile. But before long, as the Swabian&nbsp;power declined in Italy, the Guelf party was again predominant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Then followed a long period of confusion in which, by means of conspiracies and crimes of every kind, the&nbsp;Malatesta succeeded in becoming masters and tyrants&nbsp;of Rimini. And, albeit this string of events is of no&nbsp;historic value, it may serve nevertheless to give an idea&nbsp;of what was occurring throughout Romagna at that time.&nbsp;Giovanni Malatesta had died in 1247 and been succeeded&nbsp;by his son Malatesta, born in 1212, and surnamed&nbsp;Malatesta da Verrucchio. This chieftain, who lived to&nbsp;be a hundred years old, had ample time to mature his&nbsp;ambitious designs, and was the real founder of his house.&nbsp;Seizing the first suitable moment, he placed himself at&nbsp;the head of the exiled Guelfs and restored them to&nbsp;Rimini. Then, as the empire acquired fresh strength in&nbsp;Italy, he quietly bided his time and, on the descent of the&nbsp;Angevins, again assumed the leadership of the Guelfs, who&nbsp;now had the upper hand for a long time. Being repeatedly elected podestà for lengthy terms of office, he at&nbsp;last became the virtual master of Rimini. Nor was he&nbsp;checked by Rome. Pope Boniface VΠL was fully aware&nbsp;of the rights and traditional pretensions of the Holy See,&nbsp;but preferred to keep on good terms with one who had&nbsp;so largely contributed to the triumph of the Guelfs in&nbsp;Romagna. Accordingly he not only left Malatesta unmolested, but in 1299 conferred on him fresh honours&nbsp;and estates, so that his power went on increasing to the&nbsp;day of his death in 1312.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Four sons had been born to Malatesta—Malatestino, Giovanni the Lame, Paolo the Handsome, and Pandolfo ;&nbsp;but only the oldest and youngest survived him. Giovanni&nbsp;the Lame </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">^Sciancato),</span><span class="font0"> a man of a daring impetuosity only&nbsp;equalled by his ugliness, had proved so useful a general to&nbsp;Giovanni da Polenta of Ravenna as to win in reward the&nbsp;hand of that potentate’s beautiful daughter, known to&nbsp;history as Francesca da Rimini. But her heart had been&nbsp;won by the handsome Paolo, her brother-in-law ; and the&nbsp;two lovers, being surprised by Giovanni, were murdered&nbsp;by him on the spot (1285). This episode of the story of&nbsp;the Malatesta has been immortalized in Dante’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inferno.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Giovanni died in 1304. Thus in 1312 Malatestino became&nbsp;lord of Rimini, and on his decease in 1317 bequeathed&nbsp;the power to his brother Pandolfo. Even in his father’s&nbsp;lifetime the new lord had helped to extend the dominions&nbsp;of his house in Pesaro, Fano, Sinigaglia, and Fossombrone.&nbsp;He quickly perceived that, however willing Boniface VIII.&nbsp;might have been to tolerate the increased power of a&nbsp;chief who, like Malatesta da Verrucchio, had rendered&nbsp;such excellent service to the Holy See, it could not be&nbsp;expected that the papacy would really sanction the establishment of a strong and independent state in Romagna.&nbsp;He accordingly turned to the empire, and, siding with&nbsp;Louis the Bavarian, won that monarch’s favour for himself and his sons, who in 1342 were appointed imperial&nbsp;vicars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Pandolfo died in 1326, leaving two heirs, Malatesta and Galeotto. The former was nicknamed Guastafamiglia,&nbsp;because, although at first willing to let his brother share his&nbsp;power, he rid himself by violence and treachery of other&nbsp;kinsmen who claimed their just rights to a portion of the&nbsp;state. His intent was to become sole lord and to aggrandize&nbsp;his tiny principality. But the reigning pope Innocent VI.&nbsp;despatched the terrible Cardinal Albornoz to Romagna and&nbsp;it was speedily reduced by fire and sword. In 1355 the&nbsp;Malatesta shared the fate of the other potentates of the&nbsp;land. Nevertheless it was the cardinal’s policy to let&nbsp;existing Governments stand, provided they promised to&nbsp;act in subordination to the papal see. Thus, he granted&nbsp;the Malatesta brothers the investiture of Rimini, Pesaro,&nbsp;Fano, and Fossombrone, and they arranged a division of&nbsp;the state. Guastafamiglia took Pesaro, which was held&nbsp;by his descendants down to the brothers Carlo and Galeazzo.&nbsp;The former of these, who died in 1439, was father to the&nbsp;Parisina beheaded in Ferrara, whose tragic love story has&nbsp;been sung by Byron. The latter won the title of&nbsp;“ ΓInetto ” (the Incapable) by the foolish sale of his rights&nbsp;over Pesaro to the Sforza in 1447.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Galeotto, on the other hand, retained the lordship of Rimini, ruling tranquilly and on good terms with the&nbsp;popes, who allowed him to add Cervia, Cesena, and&nbsp;Bertinoro to his states. Dying in 1385 at the age of&nbsp;eighty, he left two sons—Carlo, who became lord of&nbsp;Rimini, and Pandolfo, who had Fano for his share. Carlo&nbsp;(1364-1429) was energetic, valiant, and a friend of the&nbsp;popes, who named him vicar of the church in Romagna. He&nbsp;was a patron of letters and the arts, and during his reign&nbsp;his court began to be renowned for its splendour. As he&nbsp;left no issue, his inheritance was added to that of his&nbsp;brother Pandolfo, and Fano was once more united to&nbsp;Rimini. Pandolfo (1370-1427) had led the life of a</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
