<p><span class="font1">of excommunication, that bishops and other beneficiaries having care of souls should reside in their respective&nbsp;dioceses. Innocent X. forbade cardinals to depart from&nbsp;Rome or its district—that is. a radius of 40 miles—without licence from the pope. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">State of Regulars</span><span class="font1"> was&nbsp;instituted for enforcing on religious orders and congregations the observance of their special rules and constitutions. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ecclesiastical Immunities</span><span class="font1"> treats of controversies&nbsp;concerning the liberty and independence of ecclesiastical&nbsp;jurisdiction and its violations, and prescribes that the immunities due to churches be respected. This congregation receives appeals of causes which in the first instance&nbsp;were brought before the episcopal courts. The various&nbsp;concordats entered into between Governments and the&nbsp;holy see have diminished the number of causes which&nbsp;come under the judgment of this congregation. For </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Propaganda Eide,</span><span class="font1"> see Propaganda. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Propaganda Fide for&nbsp;Omental Affairs,</span><span class="font1"> which provides for the affairs of the&nbsp;Eastern Church, was created by Pius IX. in a brief dated&nbsp;6th January 1862. It depends upon the cardinal prefect&nbsp;of Propaganda, but has its own secretary, consultors, and&nbsp;officials. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Commission for the Correction of Books of&nbsp;the Omental Church</span><span class="font1"> took its origin from a report made by&nbsp;Philip IV. of Spain to Urban VIII. in 1631, to the effect&nbsp;that the United Greeks inhabiting the Spanish dominions,&nbsp;especially Sicily, complained that schismatics had printed&nbsp;an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Euchologium,</span><span class="font1"> or liturgy of the mass, filled with errors,&nbsp;and he begged the pontiff to provide a remedy for the&nbsp;evil and its consequences. The correction of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Euxholo-gium</span><span class="font1"> was decreed, and a special congregation—now called&nbsp;commission—composed of five cardinals, assisted by bishops&nbsp;and ecclesiastics of the Oriental Church, was appointed to&nbsp;correct the books of the Oriental Church, and to publish&nbsp;a correct </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Euchologium.</span><span class="font1"> The office of the congregation of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Index</span><span class="font1"> is to examine printed books and works contrary&nbsp;to faith or morals, and to compile an index or list, which&nbsp;is published at intervals, of the works the reading of which&nbsp;is prohibited. The method now followed in the examination and condemnation of books, especially by Catholic&nbsp;authors, was fixed by Benedict XIV. A consultor examines&nbsp;the suspected work, and reports at a meeting of the congregation what it contains contrary to faith, good morals,&nbsp;ecclesiastical jurisdiction, &amp;c. An examination of these&nbsp;passages is made, and it is determined by vote—the cardinals having the decisive vote—whether the book shall&nbsp;be prohibited or corrected. The congregation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sacred&nbsp;Rites</span><span class="font1"> was instituted by Sixtus V. in 1587, in order that&nbsp;in all the churches of Rome and the world, and in the&nbsp;pontifical chapel, in masses, divine offices, and everything&nbsp;else regarding divine worship, the ancient ceremonies may&nbsp;be rigorously followed; that if any primitive rite have&nbsp;fallen into disuse it may be restored to its ancient splendour&nbsp;or reformed ; that the pontificals, rituals, ceremonials, and&nbsp;all books of sacred rites may be emended and renewed ;&nbsp;and that the divine offices of the saints may be examined.&nbsp;Particular attention is likewise given by this congregation&nbsp;to all things concerning the canonization of saints, the&nbsp;celebration of their feasts, so that all may be done in an&nbsp;orderly manner, correctly, and according to the traditions&nbsp;of the fathers. Hence this congregation decides controversies on all these and on cognate matters. Its most&nbsp;serious work consists in processes for the beatification and&nbsp;canonization of the servants of God, the honours paid to&nbsp;saints, and the recognition of martyrdoms suffered for the&nbsp;Catholic faith. Its first cause in this line was that of the&nbsp;twenty-three minor observants martyred in Japan in the&nbsp;pontificate of Urban VIII. One of the rules established&nbsp;by this pope for the recognition of saints enjoins that, except by licence of the congregation, no one can proceed to&nbsp;any act of canonization, beatification, or declaration of&nbsp;martyrdom until fifty years after the death of the subject.&nbsp;The congregation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ceremonial</span><span class="font1"> investigates and watches&nbsp;over the exact fulfilment of the sacred liturgy, and regulates and decides questions and doubts regarding formalities, pre-eminence amongst cardinals, prelates, and&nbsp;others, as well as certain sacred ceremonies in pontifical&nbsp;functions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The work of the church in the world is directed immediately by the bishops, who receive their jurisdiction from the pope. The power inherent in the episcopal&nbsp;character and order is received from God directly and&nbsp;immediately. When established in a diocese by the pope,&nbsp;the bishop, in virtue of his title, receives the power of&nbsp;governing and of taking cognizance of all spiritual causes&nbsp;which regard his flo.k, whether laymen or ecclesiastics,&nbsp;with the exception of what is specially reserved to the&nbsp;head of the church, and he possesses and exercises these&nbsp;prerogatives under the jurisdiction of and in dependence&nbsp;on the pope. The bishops in the Catholic Church at the&nbsp;present time are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Gerarchia C ιttolicα,</span><span class="font1"> March 1885) thus&nbsp;divided : (a) patriarchal sees, of the Latin rite, 7 ; of the&nbsp;Oriental rite, 5 ; (6) archiépiscopal sees, of the Latin rite,&nbsp;immediately subject to the holy see, 14; with ecclesiastical&nbsp;provinces, 137; Oriental rite, with ecclesiastical provinces,&nbsp;3; subject to patriarchates, 21 ; (t∙) episcopal sees, Latin&nbsp;rite, immediately subject to the holy see, 86 ; suffragans&nbsp;in ecclesiastical provinces, 579 ; Oriental rite, immediately&nbsp;subject to the holy see, 2 ; suffragans in ecclesiastical provinces, 8; subject to patriarchates, 41; (c∕) sees </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mdlius&nbsp;diosceseos,</span><span class="font1"> 17. The titles dependent on the sacred congregation of Propaganda are—apostolic delegations, 7 ; vicariates apostolic, 123; prefectures apostolic, 35. The total&nbsp;of these hierarchical titles amounts to 1085, and, including&nbsp;the 74 cardinalitial titles, to 1159. The vacant titles of&nbsp;all kinds amount to 107, and thus the whole hierarchy of&nbsp;the Catholic Church in March 1885 reached the total of&nbsp;1266. Priests, placed in the second degree of the ecclesiastical hierarchy, who are generally divided into parish&nbsp;priests and curates or assistants, are immediately under the&nbsp;direction of the bishops and administer directly to the&nbsp;people. Their primary office is the offering of the sacrifice&nbsp;of the mass. They also preach, bless, and administer baptism, penance, communion, and extreme unction. Their&nbsp;functions are numerous and important, and they constitute&nbsp;the working force of the church in its direct relations with&nbsp;its members throughout the world. Priests of religious&nbsp;orders exercise like functions, save those properly parochial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Oriental churches in communion with the holy see, holding the same belief and the same principle of authority&nbsp;as the Latin Church, have their own special rites, discipline,&nbsp;and liturgical language. These are chiefly the Greek,&nbsp;Melchite, Bulgarian, Ruthenian, Maronite, Syro-Chaldaic,&nbsp;Coptic, Armenian, and Roumanian rites. The Greek Oriental rite is admitted by the pure Greeks, the Slavs (in&nbsp;the Slav language), the Melchites of Syria (in Arabic),&nbsp;the Roumanians (in the Roumanian tongue), and the&nbsp;Georgians (in their own language). The Georgian Greek&nbsp;rite has no hierarchy, and many Georgians in Russia have&nbsp;passed to the Latin or Armenian rites. The Greek and&nbsp;Slav languages are approved by the church as ritual languages ; Arabic is only tolerated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Creeks in Communion. —</span><span class="font0">These are found at present in Constantinople, in the mission of Malgara in Thrace, and consist of about sixty families, having one bishop and about ten priests. Ijι this&nbsp;rite marriage is permitted to clerics previous to the reception of&nbsp;sacred orders ; but there is a tendency to abolish the practice. In&nbsp;Greece nearly 30,000 Greeks have followed the Latin rite, and these&nbsp;have seven bishops and about a hundred priests. The mass of St&nbsp;Basil is celebrated by the Greeks ten times a year,—on the three&nbsp;vigils of Christmas, the Epiphany, Easter, Holy Thursday, the&nbsp;Feast of St Basil, and the first five Sundays of Lent. After St&nbsp;Basil, St John Chrysostom abbreviated this mass and gave it the</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
