<p><span class="font1">Rügen,” near Bergen, but the highest point is the Hertha-burg (505 feet) in Jasmund. Erratic blocks are scattered throughout the island, and the roads are made with&nbsp;granite. Though much of Rügen is flat and sandy, the&nbsp;fine beech-woods which cover great part of it and the&nbsp;northern coast scenery combine with the convenient seabathing offered by the various villages round the coast to&nbsp;attract large numbers of visitors annually. The most&nbsp;beautiful and attractive part of the island is the peninsula&nbsp;of Jasmund, which terminates to the north in the Stubenkammer (from two Slavonic words meaning “ rock steps”), a&nbsp;sheer chalk cliff by the sea, the summit of which, known&nbsp;as the Königsstuhl, is 420 feet above sea-level. The east&nbsp;of Jasmund is clothed with an extensive beech-wood called&nbsp;the Stubbenitz, in which lies the Burg or Hertha Lake.&nbsp;Connected with Jasmund only by the narrow isthmus of&nbsp;Schabe to the west is the peninsula of Wittow, the most&nbsp;fertile part of the island. At its north-west extremity&nbsp;rises the height of Arcona, with a lighthouse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The official capital of the island is Bergen (3662 inhabitants), connected since 1883 with Stralsund by a&nbsp;railway and ferry. The other chief places are Garz&nbsp;(2014), Sagard (1447), Gingst (1285), and Putbus&nbsp;(1752). The last is the old capital of a barony of the&nbsp;princes of Putbus. Sassnitz, Göhren, and Putbus are&nbsp;among the favourite bathing resorts. Schoritz was the&nbsp;birthplace of the patriot and poet, Arndt (1769-1860).&nbsp;Ecclesiastically, Rügen is divided into 27 parishes, in which&nbsp;the pastoral succession is said to be almost hereditary.&nbsp;The inhabitants are distinguished from those of the mainland by peculiarities of dialect, costume, and habits ; and&nbsp;even the various peninsulas differ from each other in these&nbsp;particulars. The peninsula of Mönchgut has best preserved&nbsp;its peculiarities ; but there too primitive simplicity is yielding to the influence of the annual stream of summer&nbsp;visitors. The inhabitants rear some cattle, and Rügen has&nbsp;long been famous for its geese ; but the only really considerable industry is fishing,—the herring-fishery being&nbsp;especially important. Rügen, with the neighbouring&nbsp;islands, forms a governmental department, with a population (1880) of 46,115.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The original Germanic inhabitants of Rügen were dispossessed by Slavs ; and there are still various relics of the long reign of paganism&nbsp;that ensued. In the Stubbenitz and elsewhere Huns’ or giants’&nbsp;graves (see p. 52, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">supra)</span><span class="font0"> are common ; and near the Hertha Lake&nbsp;are the ruins of an ancient edifice which some have sought (though&nbsp;perhaps erroneously) to identify with the shrine of the heathen&nbsp;deity Hertha or Nerthus, referred to by Tacitus. On Arcona in&nbsp;Wittow are the remains of an ancient fortress, enclosing a temple&nbsp;of the four-headed god Svantevit, which was destroyed in 1168 by&nbsp;the Danish king AVahlemar I., when he made himself master of&nbsp;the island. From that date until 1325 Rügen was ruled by a succession of native princes, at first under Danish supremacy ; and,&nbsp;after being for a century and a half the possession of a branch of&nbsp;the ruling family in Pomerania, it was finally united with that&nbsp;province in 1478, and passed with it into the possession of Sweden&nbsp;in 1648. With the rest of Western Pomerania Rügen has belonged&nbsp;to Prussia since 1815.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUHNKEK, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">David</span><span class="font1"> (1723-1798), one of the most illustrious scholars of the Netherlands, was of German&nbsp;origin, having been born in Pomerania in 1723. His&nbsp;parents had him educated for the church, but after a&nbsp;residence of two years at the university of Wittenberg, he&nbsp;determined to live the life of a scholar. His biographer&nbsp;(Wyttenbach) somewhat quaintly exhorts all studious&nbsp;youths who feel the inner call as Ruhnken did to show&nbsp;the same boldness in crossing the wishes of their parents.&nbsp;At Wittenberg, Ruhnken lived in close intimacy with the&nbsp;two most distinguished professors, Ritter and Berger, who&nbsp;fired his passion for things ancient, and guided his studies.&nbsp;To them he owed a thorough grounding in ancient history&nbsp;and Roman antiquities and literature ; and from them he&nbsp;learned what distinguished him among the scholars of his&nbsp;time, a pure and at the same time a vivid Latin style.&nbsp;At Wittenberg, too, Ruhnken derived valuable mental&nbsp;training from study in mathematics and Roman law.&nbsp;Probably nothing would have severed him from his surroundings there but a desire which daily grew upon him&nbsp;to explore the inmost recesses of Greek literature. Neither&nbsp;at AVittenberg nor at any other German university was&nbsp;Greek in that age seriously studied. It was taught in the&nbsp;main to students in divinity for the sake of the Greek&nbsp;Testament and the early fathers of the church,—taught as a&nbsp;necessary appendage to Hebrew and Syriac, and generally&nbsp;by the same professors. F. A. AVolf is the real creator of&nbsp;Greek scholarship in modern Germany, and Porson’s gibe&nbsp;that “the Germans in Greek are sadly to seek” was&nbsp;barbed with truth. It is significant of the state of&nbsp;Hellenic studies in Germany in 1743 that their leading&nbsp;exponents were Gesner and Ernesti. Ruhnken was well&nbsp;advised by his friends at AVittenberg to seek the university&nbsp;of Leyden, where, stimulated by the influence of Bentley,&nbsp;the great scholar Tiberius Hemsterhuis had founded the&nbsp;only real school of Greek learning which had existed on&nbsp;the Continent since the days of Joseph Scaliger and Isaac&nbsp;Casaubon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Perhaps no two men of letters ever lived in closer friendship than Hemsterhuis and Ruhnken during the&nbsp;twenty-three years which passed from Ruhnken’s arrival&nbsp;in the Netherlands in 1743 to the death of Hemsterhuis&nbsp;in 1766. A few years made it clear that Ruhnken and&nbsp;A<sup>7</sup>Alckenaer were the two pupils of the great master on&nbsp;whom his inheritance must devolve. As his reputation&nbsp;spread, many efforts were made to attract Ruhnken back&nbsp;to Germany, but the air of freedom which he drew in the&nbsp;Netherlands was more to him than all the flesh-pots his&nbsp;native land could offer. Indeed, after settling in Leyden,&nbsp;he only left the country once, when he spent a year in&nbsp;Paris, ransacking the public libraries (1755). For work&nbsp;achieved, this year of Ruhnken may compare even with&nbsp;the famous year which Ritschl spent in Italy. In 1757&nbsp;Ruhnken was appointed lecturer in Greek, to assist&nbsp;Hemsterhuis, and in 1761 he succeeded Oudendorp, with&nbsp;the title of “ ordinary professor of history and eloquence,”&nbsp;but practically as Latin professor. This promotion drew&nbsp;on him the enmity of some native Netherlanders, who&nbsp;deemed themselves (not without some show of reason) to&nbsp;possess stronger claims for a chair of Latin. The only&nbsp;defence made by Ruhnken was to publish works on Latin&nbsp;literature which eclipsed and silenced his rivals. In 1766&nbsp;A<sup>7</sup>Alckenaer succeeded Hemsterhuis in the Greek chair.&nbsp;The intimacy between the two colleagues was only broken&nbsp;by A<sup>7</sup>Alckenaeris death in 1785, and stood without strain&nbsp;the test of common candidature for the office (an important one at Leyden) of university librarian, in which&nbsp;Ruhnken was successful. Ruhnken’s later years were&nbsp;clouded by severe domestic misfortune, and by the political commotions which, after the outbreak of the war&nbsp;with England in 1780, troubled the Netherlands without&nbsp;ceasing, and threatened to extinguish the university of&nbsp;Leyden. The year of Ruhnken’s death was 1798.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Personally, he was as far as possible removed from being a recluse or a pedant. He had a well-knit and&nbsp;even handsome frame, attractive manners (though sometimes tinged with irony), and a nature simple and healthy,&nbsp;and open to impressions from all sides. Fond of society,&nbsp;he cared little to what rank his associates belonged, if&nbsp;they were genuine men in whom he might find something&nbsp;to learn. His biographer even says of him in his early&nbsp;days that he knew how to sacrifice to the Sirens without&nbsp;proving traitor to the Muses. Life in the open air had a&nbsp;great attraction for him ; he was fond of sport, and would&nbsp;sometimes devote to it two or three days in the week.
