<p><span class="font1">to French poetry to “ follow the ancients,” and so forth, an insult to the author of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adolescence Clémentine</span><span class="font1"> and his&nbsp;followers. The French court, and indeed all French society,&nbsp;was just then much interested in literary questions, and a&nbsp;curious story is told of the rivalry that ensued. Mellin de&nbsp;Saint-Gelais, it is said, the chief of the “ École Marotique ”&nbsp;and a poet of no small merit, took up Ronsard’s book and read&nbsp;part of it in a more or less designedly burlesque fashion before&nbsp;the king. It may be observed that if he did so it was a distinctly rash and uncourtier-like act, inasmuch as, from Ronsard’s father’s position in the royal household, the poet was&nbsp;personally known and liked both by Henry and by his family.&nbsp;At any rate, Marguerite de Valois, the king’s sister, afterwards duchess of Savoy, is said to have snatched the book&nbsp;from Saint-Gelais and insisted on reading it herself, with the&nbsp;result of general applause. Henceforward, if not before, his&nbsp;acceptance as a poet was not doubtful, and indeed the tradition&nbsp;of his having to fight his way against cabals is almost entirely&nbsp;unsupported. His popularity in his own time was overwhelming and immediate, and his prosperity was unbroken. He&nbsp;published his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hymns</span><span class="font1">, dedicated to Marguerite dc Savoie, in 1555;&nbsp;the conclusion of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amours,</span><span class="font1"> addressed to another heroine,&nbsp;in 1556; and then a collection of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Œuvres complètes,</span><span class="font1"> said to be&nbsp;due to the invitation of Mary Stuart, queen of Francis II., in&nbsp;1560; with </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Elégies, mascarades et bergeries</span><span class="font1"> in 1565. To this&nbsp;same year belongs his most important and interesting </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Abrégé&nbsp;de l’art poétique français.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rapid change of sovereigns did Ronsard no harm. Charles IX., who succeeded his brother after a very short time,&nbsp;was even better inclined to him than Henry and Francis. He&nbsp;gave him rooms in the palace; he bestowed upon him divers&nbsp;abbacies and priories; and he called him and regarded him&nbsp;constantly as his master in poetry. Neither was Charles IX.&nbsp;a bad poet. This royal patronage, however, had its disagreeable side. It excited violent dislike to Ronsard on the part&nbsp;of the Huguenots, who wrote constant pasquinades against him,&nbsp;strove (by a ridiculous exaggeration of the Dionvsiac festival&nbsp;at Arcueil, in which the friends had indulged to celebrate the&nbsp;success of the first French tragedy, Jodelle’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cléopâtre)</span><span class="font1"> to represent him as a libertine and an atheist, and (which seems to have&nbsp;annoyed him more than anything else) set up his follower&nbsp;Du Bart as as his rival. According to some words of his own,&nbsp;which are quite credible considering the ways of the time, they&nbsp;were not contented with this variety of argument, but attempted&nbsp;to have him assassinated. During this period Ronsard’s work&nbsp;was considerable but mostly occasional, and the one work of&nbsp;magnitude upon which Charles put him, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Françiade</span><span class="font1"> (1572),&nbsp;has never been ranked, even by his most devoted admirers,&nbsp;as a chief title to fame. The metre (the decasyllabic) which&nbsp;the king chose could not but contrast unfavourably with&nbsp;the magnificent alexandrines which Du Bartas and Agrippa&nbsp;d’Aubignê were shortly to produce; the general plan is feebly&nbsp;classical, and the very language has little or nothing of that&nbsp;racy mixture of scholarliness and love of natural beauty which&nbsp;distinguishes the best work of the Pléiade. The poem could&nbsp;never have had an abiding success, but at its appearance it had&nbsp;the singular bad luck almost to coincide with the massacre of&nbsp;St Bartholomew, which had occurred about a fortnight before&nbsp;its publication. One party in the state were certain to look&nbsp;coldly on the work of a minion of the court at such a juncture,&nbsp;the other had something else to think of. The death of Charles&nbsp;made, indeed, little difference in the court favouf which Ronsard enjoyed, but, combined with his increasing infirmities,&nbsp;it seems to have determined him to quit court life. During&nbsp;his last days he lived chiefly at a house which he possessed in&nbsp;Vendôme, the capital of his native province, at his abbey at&nbsp;Croix-Val in the same neighbourhood, or else at Paris, where he&nbsp;was usually the guest of Jean Galland, well known as a scholar,&nbsp;at the Collège de Boncourt. It seems also that he had a town&nbsp;house of his own in the Faubourg Saint-Marcel. At any rate&nbsp;his preferments made him in perfectly easy circumstances,&nbsp;and he seems neither to have derived nor wished for any profit&nbsp;from his books. A half-jocular suggestion that his publisher&nbsp;should give him money to buy “ du bois pour se chauffer ”&nbsp;in return for his last revision of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Œuvres completes</span><span class="font1"> is the only&nbsp;trace of any desire of the kind. On the other hand, he received&nbsp;not merely gifts and endowments from his own sovereign but&nbsp;presents from many others, including Elizabeth of England.&nbsp;Mary, queen of Scots, who had known him earlier, addressed him&nbsp;from her prison ; and Tasso consulted him on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Gerusalemme.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">His last years were, however, saddened not merely by the death&nbsp;of many of his most intimate friends, but by constant and&nbsp;increasing ill-health. This did not interfere with his literary&nbsp;work in point of quality, for he was rarely idle, and some of&nbsp;his latest work is among his best. But he indulged (what&nbsp;few poets have wisely indulged) the temptation of constantly&nbsp;altering his work, and many of his later alterations are by&nbsp;no means for the better. Towards the end of 1585 his condition of health grew worse and worse, and he seems to have&nbsp;moved restlessly from one of his houses to another for some&nbsp;months. When the end came, which, though in great pain, he&nbsp;met in a resolute and religious manner, he was at his priory of&nbsp;Saint-Cosme at Tours, and he was buried in the church of that&nbsp;name on Friday, December 27.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The character and fortunes of Ronsard’s works, are among the most remarkable in literary history, and supply in themselves a&nbsp;kind of illustration of the progress of French literature during the&nbsp;last three centuries. It was long his fortune to be almost always&nbsp;extravagantly admired or violently attacked. At first, as has&nbsp;been said, the enmity, not altogether unprovoked, of the friends&nbsp;and followers of Marot fell to his lot, then the still fiercer antagonism&nbsp;of the Huguenot faction, who, happening to possess, a poet of great&nbsp;merit in Du Bartas, were able to attack Ronsard in his tenderest&nbsp;point. But fate had by no means done its worst with him in his&nbsp;lifetime. After his death the classical reaction set in under the&nbsp;auspices of Malherbe, who seems to have been animated with a sort&nbsp;of personal hatred of Ronsard, though it is not clear that they ever&nbsp;met. After Malherbe the rising glory of Corneille and his contemporaries obscured the tentative and unequal work of the Pléiade,&nbsp;which was, moreover, directly attacked by Boileau himself, the&nbsp;dictator of French criticism in the last half of the 17th century.&nbsp;Then Ronsard was, except by a few men of taste, like La Bruyère&nbsp;and Fénelon, forgotten when he was not sneered at. In this condition he remained during the whole 18th century and the first&nbsp;quarter of the 19th. The Romantic revival, seeing in him a victim&nbsp;of its special </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bete noire</span><span class="font1"> Boileau, and attracted by his splendid&nbsp;diction, rich metrical faculty, and combination of classical and&nbsp;medieval peculiarities, adopted his name as a kind of battle-cry,&nbsp;and for the moment exaggerated his merits somewhat. The critical&nbsp;work, however, first of Sainte-Beuve in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tableau de la littérature&nbsp;française au lôème siècle,</span><span class="font1"> and since of others, has established&nbsp;Ronsard pretty securely in his right place, a place which may be&nbsp;defined in a few sentences.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the general position of the Pléiade, see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">French Literature. </span><span class="font1">Ronsard, its acknowledged chief and its most voluminous poet,&nbsp;was probably also its best, though a few isolated pieces of Belleau&nbsp;excel him in airy lightness of touch. Several sonnets of Du Bellay&nbsp;exhibit what may be called the intense and voluptuous melancholy&nbsp;of the Renaissance more perfectly than anything of his, and the&nbsp;finest passages of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tragiques</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Divine Sepmaine</span><span class="font1"> surpass&nbsp;his work in command of the alexandrine and in power, of turning&nbsp;it to the purposes of satirical invective and descriptive narration.&nbsp;But that work is, as has been said, very extensive (we possess at a&nbsp;rough guess not much short of a hundred thousand lines of his),&nbsp;and it is extraordinarily varied in form. He did not introduce the&nbsp;sonnet into* France, but he practised it very soon after its introduction and with admirable skill—the famous “ Quand vous serez bien&nbsp;vieille ” being one of the acknowledged gems of French literature.&nbsp;His odes, which are very numerous, are also very interesting and in&nbsp;their best shape very perfect compositions. He began by imitating&nbsp;the strophic arrangement of the ancients, but very soon had the&nbsp;wisdom to desert this for a kind of adjustment of the Horatian ode&nbsp;to rhyme, instead of exact quantitative metre. In this latter kind&nbsp;he devised some exquisitely melodious rhythms of which, till our&nbsp;own day, the secret died with the 17th century. His more sustained&nbsp;work.sometimes displays a bad selection of measure; and his&nbsp;occasional poetry—epistles, eclogues, elegies, &amp;c.—is injured by&nbsp;its vast volume. But the preface to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Françiade</span><span class="font1"> is a very fine&nbsp;piece of verse, far superior (it is in alexandrines) to the poem itself.&nbsp;Generally speaking, Ronsard is best in his amatory verse (the long&nbsp;series of sonnets and odes to Cassandre, Marie, Genèvre, Hélène—&nbsp;Hélène de Surgères, a later and mainly “ literary ” love—&amp;c.), and&nbsp;in his. descriptions of the country (the famous “Mignonne allons&nbsp;voir si la rose,” the “ Fontaine Bellerie,” the “ Forêt de Gastine,”&nbsp;and so forth), which have an extraordinary grace and freshness.&nbsp;No one used with more art than he the graceful diminutives which</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
