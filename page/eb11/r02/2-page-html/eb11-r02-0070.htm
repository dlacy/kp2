<p><span class="font3">staff. In other cases individual newspapers put themselves on the same footing as the London newspapers ■ by engaging&nbsp;separate staffs of reporters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The effect of telegraphic improvements may be partially gauged by the fact that in 1871 the number of words handed&nbsp;in for transmission through the British Post Office for Press&nbsp;purposes (special rates being allowed) was 22,000,000, and that&nbsp;in 1900 it had risen to 835,000,000. Meanwhile the evolution&nbsp;of the modem newspaper had brought many other kinds of&nbsp;reporting, besides parliamentary, into play.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">What is commonly called “ descriptive reporting ” has in some cases nearly shouldered the reporting of speeches out of newspapers. The special correspondent or the war correspondent is a&nbsp;descriptive reporter.” The *' interviewer ” came into great&nbsp;prominence during the “ eighties ” and “ nineties,” and the influence&nbsp;of American journalistic methods, which made smart reporting the&nbsp;most valuable commercial asset of the popular newspaper, and&nbsp;the reporter correspondingly important, spread to other countries.&nbsp;No daily newspaper now confines its reporting to the affairs of the&nbsp;part of the country in which it is published. The electric telegraph&nbsp;has made the work of the reporter more arduous and his responsibility&nbsp;greater. The variety of work open to reporting causes considerable&nbsp;difference, of course, in the professional status of the journalists&nbsp;who do such work. This subject generally is discussed in the article&nbsp;Newspapers, but one instance of the recognition of the modern&nbsp;reporter’s responsibility is worth special mention. In the year 1900,&nbsp;in the English case of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Walter</span><span class="font2"> v. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lane</span><span class="font2"> (see Copyright), it was decided,&nbsp;on the final appeal to the House of Lords, that the reporter of a&nbsp;speech, printed verbatim in a newspaper, was under the Copyright&nbsp;Act of 1842 to be considered the “ author.” Absurd as it might seem&nbsp;to call the reporter the author of another man’s speech, the decision&nbsp;gave effect to the fact that it is his labour and skill which bring into&nbsp;existence the “ copy ” to which alone can right of property attach.&nbsp;Strictly speaking, he is the author of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">report</span><span class="font2"> of the speech; but&nbsp;for literary purposes the report </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">is</span><span class="font2"> the speech. It must, however, be&nbsp;borne in mmd that there may be more than one verbatim report,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">and therefore more than one “ author.”</span></p>

<p><span class="font3">REPOUSSÉ (Fr. “ driven back ”), the art of raising designs upon metal by hammering from the back, while the “ ground ”&nbsp;is left relatively untouched (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Metal Work</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Plate).&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">The term is often loosely used, being applied indifferently to&nbsp;“ embossing.” Embossing is also called “ </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">repousse sur coquille ”&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">and “ estampage,” but the latter consists of embossing by&nbsp;mechanical means and is therefore not to be considered as an&nbsp;art process. Moreover, it reverses the method of repoussé, the&nbsp;work being done from the front, and by driving down the ground&nbsp;leaving the design in relief. Gold, silver, bronze, brass, etc.,&nbsp;being easily malleable metals, are specially suitable to repoussé,&nbsp;which at the present day, in its finer forms, is mainly employed&nbsp;for silver-plate and jewelry. ‘ The silver-plate in repoussé of&nbsp;Gilbert Marks (d. 1905) in England, and the portrait-plaques&nbsp;from life by Stephan Schwartz (b. in Hungary, 1851) in&nbsp;Austria, are noteworthy modern examples of the art.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Repoussé—a term of relatively recent adoption, employed to differentiate the process from embossing—has been known&nbsp;from remote antiquity. Nothing has ever excelled, and little&nbsp;Jias ever approached, the perfection of the bronzes of Siris&nbsp;(4th century </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font3"> in the British Museum), of which the armour-plate—especially the shoulder-pieces—presents heroic figure-groups beaten up from behind with punches from the flat plate&nbsp;until the heads and other portions are wholly detached—that is&nbsp;to say, in high relief from the ground of which they form a part.&nbsp;Yet the metal, almost as thin as paper, is practically of constant&nbsp;thickness, and nowhere is there any sign of puncture. The&nbsp;“ Bernay treasure,” in the Bibliothèque Nationale, Paris,&nbsp;discovered in 1830, belongs to the 2nd century B.c., and includes&nbsp;silver vases of Roman execution decorated with groups in&nbsp;mezzo-relief, beaten up in sections and soldered together. The&nbsp;best of these, of which perhaps the finest is that known from&nbsp;its subject as “La nymphe de la fontaine Pirène et Pégase,”&nbsp;belong to the noblest period of Roman art. The Hildesheim&nbsp;treasure (discovered 1868) comprises a </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">patera</span><span class="font3"> on the ground of&nbsp;which is a superb </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">emblema</span><span class="font3"> representing Minerva in high relief.&nbsp;These repoussé </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">emblemala</span><span class="font3"> were usually of another metal and&nbsp;applied to the vase which they decorated; indeed repoussé was&nbsp;of leading importance in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">caelatura,</span><span class="font3"> or the metallic art (statuary&nbsp;excepted) of classic times. Thus the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">patera</span><span class="font3"> of Hildesheim, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">patera</span><span class="font3"> of Rennes, and the earlier shoulder-plate of the Siris&nbsp;bronze may be accepted as illustrative of the highest development of repoussé.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The art was not only Greek and Graeco-Roman in its early practice; it was pursued also by the Assyrians, the Phoenicians,&nbsp;and other oriental peoples, as well as in Cyprus and elsewhere,&nbsp;and was carried forward, almost without a break, although with&nbsp;much depreciation of style and execution, into medieval times.&nbsp;In the nth century the emperor Henry II. presented as a thank-offering to the Basel cathedral the altar-piece, in the Byzantine&nbsp;style, decorated with fine repoussé panels of gold (representing&nbsp;Jesus Christ with two angels and two saints), which is now in the&nbsp;Cluny Museum in Paris. Up to this time, also, repoussé instead&nbsp;of casting in metal was practised for large work, and Limoges&nbsp;became a centre for the manufacture and exportation of sepulchral figures in repoussé bronze. These were affixed to wooden&nbsp;cores. By the time of Benvenuto Cellini the art was confined&nbsp;almost entirely to goldsmiths and silversmiths (who, except&nbsp;Cellini himself, rarely cast their work) ; and to them the sculptors&nbsp;and artists of to-day are still content to relegate it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The elementary principle of the method, after the due preparation and annealing of the plate, was to trace on the back of it the design to be beaten up, and to place it face downwards upon&nbsp;a stiff yet not entirely unresisting ground (in the primitive&nbsp;stage of development this was wood), and then with hammers and&nbsp;punches to beat up the design into relief. According to Cellini,&nbsp;his master Caradosso da Milano would beat up his plate on a&nbsp;metal casting obtained from a pattern he had previously modelled&nbsp;in wax; but he is pot sufficiently explicit to enable us to judge&nbsp;whether this casting was hollow mould, which would result in&nbsp;true repoussé, or in the round, which·is tantamount to </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">repoussé&nbsp;sur coquille,</span><span class="font3"> or embossing.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Nowadays the plate is laid upon and affixed to a “ pitch-block,” a resinous ground docile to heat, usually composed of pitch mixed with pounded fire-brick, or, for coarser work such&nbsp;as brass, with white sand, with a little tallow and resin. This&nbsp;compound, while being sufficiently hard, is elastic, solid, adhesive&nbsp;and easy to apply and remove. Gold and silver are not only&nbsp;the densest and most workable but the most ductile metals,&nbsp;admitting of great expansion without cracking if properly&nbsp;annealed. The tools include hammers, punches (in numerous&nbsp;shapes for tracing, raising, grounding, chasing and texturing&nbsp;the surfaces), together with a special anvil called in French a&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">recingle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">qt</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;"> res sing,</span><span class="font3"> in English “ snarl.” The </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">recingle, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">qt</span><span class="font3"> small&nbsp;anvil with projecting upturned point, was known in the 16th&nbsp;century. This point is introduced into the hollow of the vase&nbsp;or other vessel such as punch and hammer cannot freely enter,&nbsp;which it is desired to ornament with reliefs. A blow of a hammer&nbsp;on that part of the anvil where the prolongation first projects&nbsp;from it, produces, by the return spring, a corresponding blow&nbsp;at the point which the operator desires to apply within the vase.&nbsp;The same effect is produced by the modern “ snarl ” or “ snarling&nbsp;iron ”—a bar of steel, with an inch or two of the smaller end&nbsp;upturned and ending in a knob—held firmly in a Ughtly screwed-up vice, whereby the blow is similarly repeated or echoed by&nbsp;vibration. The repoussé work, when complete, is afterwards&nbsp;finished at the front and chased up. The same vase, to be&nbsp;worked up by embossing, would be filled with “ cement ” and&nbsp;laid on a sand-bag, and finally the whole would be heated and&nbsp;the cement run out. In the case of rçpoussé the vase itself may&nbsp;be beaten up out of the metal on the pitch-block. It must be&nbsp;understood that in order to obtain a result not merely excellent&nbsp;in technique but artistic and unmechanical in effect, the blows&nbsp;of the hammer must be made with feeling and “ sentiment,”&nbsp;otherwise the result cannot be a work of art.</span></p>
