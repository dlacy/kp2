<p><span class="font1">and afterwards tbe head. As to the body of the worm from which theſe pieces were ſeparated, it lived as well&nbsp;as before, and ſeemed indeed to ſuffer nothing by the&nbsp;loſs, the head-part being immediately uſed as if thfe head&nbsp;was thereon, boring the creature’s way into the mud.&nbsp;There are, beſides this, two other points in which the&nbsp;reproduction will not take place ; the one of theſe is&nbsp;about the fifth or ſixth ring from the head, and the&nbsp;other at the ſame diſtance from the tail ; and in all pro-bability the condition of the great artery in theſe parts&nbsp;is the cauſe of this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">what is ſaid of the want of the reproductive power of theſe parts relates only to the head and tail ends ;&nbsp;for as to the body, it feels very little inconvenience from&nbsp;the loſs of what is taken off, and very ſpeedily reproduces thoſe parts, where then does the principle of life&nbsp;reſide in fuch worms, which, after having their heads&nbsp;cut off, will have not only the ſame motions, but even&nbsp;the inclinations, that they had before? and yet this difficulty is very ſmall, compared to ſeveral others which&nbsp;at the ſame time offer themſelves to our reaſon. Is this&nbsp;wonderful reproduction of parts only a natural conſe-quence of the laws of motion ? or is there lodged in the&nbsp;body of the creature a chain of minute buds or ſhoots,&nbsp;a fort of little embryos, already formed and placed in&nbsp;£uch part3 where the reproductions are to begin ? Are&nbsp;thefe worms only mere machines? or are they, like more&nbsp;perfect animals, a fort of compound, the ſprings of&nbsp;whoſe motions are actuated or regulated by a fort of&nbsp;foul ? And if they have themſelves ſuch a principle,&nbsp;how is it that this principle is multiplied, and is found&nbsp;in every ſeparate piece ? Is it to be granted, that there&nbsp;are in theſe worms, not a ſingle ſoul (if it is to be ſo call-ed) in each, but that each contains as many fouls as there&nbsp;are pieces capable of reproducing perfect animals ? Are&nbsp;we to believe with Malpighi, that theſe forts of worms&nbsp;are all heart and brain from one end to the other! This&nbsp;may be ; but yet if we knew that it was ſo, we ſhould&nbsp;know in reality but very little the more for knowing it:&nbsp;and it ſeems, after all, that in caſes of this kind we are&nbsp;only to admire the works of the great Creator, and ſit&nbsp;down in ſilence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The nice ſenſe of feeling in ſpiders has been much talked of by naturalifts ; but it appears that thefe worms&nbsp;have yet ſomewhat more ſurpriſing in them in regard&nbsp;to this particular. If a piece of ſtick, or any other&nbsp;ſubſtance, be brought near them, they do not ſtay tor&nbsp;its touching them, but begin to leap and friſk about as&nbsp;ſoon as it comes towards them. There want, however,&nbsp;ſome farther experiments to aſcertain whether this be&nbsp;really owing to feeling or to ſight ; for though we can&nbsp;diſcover no diſtinct organs of tight in theſe creatures,&nbsp;yet they ſeem affected by the light of the ſun or a&nbsp;candle, and always friſk about it in the ſame manner at&nbsp;the approach of either ; nay, even the moon-light has&nbsp;ſome effect upon them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A twig of willow, poplar, or many other trees, be-ιng planted in the earth, takes root, and becomes a tree, every piece of which will in the ſame manner pro-duce other trees. The caſe is the ſame with theſe worms:&nbsp;they are cut to pieces, and theſe ſeveral pieces become&nbsp;perfect animals ; and each of theſe may be again cut&nbsp;into a number of pieces, each of which will in the ſame&nbsp;manner produce an animal. It had been ſuppoſed by&nbsp;ſome that theſe worms were ovipaζous t but Mr Bo-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">nett, on cutting </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">one </span><span class="font1">of them to pieces, having obſerved a ſiender ſubftance, reſembling a ſmall filament, to move&nbsp;at the end of one of the pieces, ſeparated it ; and on&nbsp;examining it with glaffes, found it to be a perfect worm,&nbsp;of the ſame form with its parent, which lived and grew&nbsp;larger in a veffel of water into which he put it. Theſe&nbsp;ſmall bodies are eafily divided, and very readily complete&nbsp;themſelves again, a day uſually ſerving for the produc-tion of a head to the part that wants one ; and, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">general,</span><span class="font1"> the ſmaller and ilenderer the worms are, the ſooner they complete themſelves after this operation, when,&nbsp;the bodies of the large worms are examined by the microſcope, it is very eaſy to ſee the appearance of the&nbsp;young worms alive, and moving about within them :&nbsp;but it requires great precifion and exactneſs to be certain&nbsp;of this ; lince the ramifications of the great artery have&nbsp;very much the appearance of young worms, and they&nbsp;are kept in a fort of continual motion by the ſyſtolea.&nbsp;and diaftoles of the ſeveral portions of the artery, which&nbsp;ſerve as ſo many hearts. It is very certain, that what&nbsp;we force in regard to theſe animals by our operations,&nbsp;is done alſo naturally every day in the brooks and&nbsp;ditches where they live. A curious obſerver will find&nbsp;in theſe places many of them without heads or tails, and&nbsp;ſome without either; as alſo other fragments of various&nbsp;kinds, aſl which are then in the act of completing them-ſelves : but whether accidents have reduced them to&nbsp;this ſtate, or they thus purpoſely throw off parts of&nbsp;their own body for the reproduction of more animals,&nbsp;it is not eaſy to determine. They are plainly liable to&nbsp;many accidents, by which they loſe the ſeveral parts of&nbsp;their body, and mnſt periſh very early if they had not&nbsp;a power of reproducing what was loſt : they often are&nbsp;broken into two pieces, by the refiſtance of feme hard&nbsp;piece of mud which they enter ; and they are ſubject&nbsp;to a diſeaſe, a kind of gangrene, rotting off the ſeveral&nbsp;parts of their bodies, and mnſt inevitably periſh by it,..&nbsp;had they not this ſurprifing property.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This worm was a ſecond inſtance, after the polype, of the ſurpriſtng power in an animal of recovering its&nbsp;moſt effential parts when loſt. But Nature does not&nbsp;ſeem to have limited her beneficence in this reſpect to&nbsp;theſe two creatures. Mr Bonett tried the ſame expe-rimeπts on another ſpecies of water-worm, differing from&nbsp;the former in being much.thicker. This kind of worm,&nbsp;when divided in the ſummer-ſeaſon, very often ſhows the&nbsp;fame property: ſor if it be cut into three or four pieces,&nbsp;the pieces wiſl lie like dead for a long time, but afterwards will move about again ; and wiſl be found iu this&nbsp;ftate of reſt to have recovered a head, or a tail, or both·.&nbsp;After recovering their parts, they move very little⅝ and,&nbsp;according to this gentleman’s experiments, ſeldom ſlve&nbsp;more than a month.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">it ſhould ſeem, that the more difficult luccefs of this laſt kind of worm, after cutting, and the long time it&nbsp;takes to recover the loſt parts, iſ it do recover them </span><span class="font0">at&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">aſl, is owing to its thickneſs ; fince we always find in&nbsp;that ſpecies of worms which ſucceeds beſt of all, that&nbsp;thoſe which are thinneſt always recover their parts much&nbsp;ſooner than the others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The water-inſects alſo are not the only creatures which have this power of recovering their loſt parts.&nbsp;Tlie earth affords us ſome already diſcovered to grow&nbsp;in this manner from their cuttings, and theſe not leſs&nbsp;deferring our admiration than thoſe of the water : the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
