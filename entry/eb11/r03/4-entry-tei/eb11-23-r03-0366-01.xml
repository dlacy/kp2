    <p><label>RISHANGER, WILLIAM</label> (c. 1250-<hi rend="italic">c.</hi> 1312), English chronicler, made his profession as a Benedictine at St Alban’s abbey in 1271, of which he perhaps became the official chronicler. The most important of his writings is the <hi rend="italic">Narratio de bellis apud Lewes et Evesham.</hi> Though written many years afterwards and drawn from other sources, it is a spirited account of the barons’ war. HeJs so great an admirer of Simon de Montfort that this work has been called a hagiography. He is credited with the authorship of a chronicle covering the period 1259-1306; this has been disputed, but the work is printed under his name by Riley. Another work of his, of not much importance, is a chronicle entitled <hi rend="italic">Recapitulatis brevis de gestis domini Edwardi, &amp;c.</hi> He is probably not the author of other works commonly attributed to him.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Authorities.—</hi> <hi rend="italic">Wilhelmi Rishanger chronica et annales,</hi> Rolls Series, Introduction ed.
