<p><span class="font1">determined the method </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">scholarship for </span><span class="font0">the </span><span class="font1">last three centuries in Europe. The lack of printed books in the first period of the Revival,&nbsp;and thc comparative rarity of Greek erudition among students,&nbsp;combined with the intense enthusiasm aroused for the new gospel&nbsp;of the classics, gave special value to the personal teaching of these&nbsp;professors. They iourneyed from city to city, attracted by promises&nbsp;of higher pay, and allured by ever-growing laurels of popular fame.&nbsp;Each large town established its public. study, academy or university, similar institutions under varying designations, for the&nbsp;exposition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">literae humaniores.</span><span class="font1"> The humanists., or professors&nbsp;of that branch of knowledge, became a class of the highest dignity.&nbsp;They were found in the chanceries of the republics, in the papal&nbsp;curia, in the council chambers of princes, at the headquarters of&nbsp;condottieri, wherever business had to be transacted, speeches to&nbsp;be made and the work of secretaries to be performed. Furthermore, they undertook the charge of private education, opening&nbsp;schools which displaced the medieval system of instruction, and&nbsp;taking engagements as tutors in the families of. despots, noblemen&nbsp;and wealthy merchants. The academy established by Vittorino&nbsp;da Feltre at Mantua under the protection of Gian Francesco Gonzaga&nbsp;for the training of pupils of both sexes, might be chosen as the type&nbsp;of this Italian method. His scholars, who were lodged in appropriate buildings, met daily to hear the master read and comment&nbsp;on the classics. They learned portions of the best authors by heart,&nbsp;exercised themselves in translation from one language to another,&nbsp;and practised composition in prose and verse. It was Vittorino’s&nbsp;care to see that, while their memories were dulv stored with words&nbsp;and facts, their judgment should be formed by critical analysis,&nbsp;attention to style, and comparison of the authors of a decadent age&nbsp;with those who were acknowledged classics. During the hours&nbsp;of recreation suitable physical exercises, as fencing, riding and gymnastics, were conducted under qualified trainers. From this sketch&nbsp;it will be seen how closely the educational system which came into&nbsp;England during the reigns of the Tudors, and which has prevailed&nbsp;until the present time, was modelled upon the Italian type.. English&nbsp;youths who spend their time at Eton between athletic sports&nbsp;and Latin verses, and who take an Ireland with a first class in&nbsp;“ Greats ” at Osdord, are pursuing the same course of physical&nbsp;and mental discipline as the princes of Gonzaga or Montefeltro&nbsp;in the 15th century.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The humanists effected a deeply penetrating change in social manners. Through their influence as tutors, professors, orators&nbsp;and courtiers, society was permeated by a fresh ideal of&nbsp;culture. To be a gentleman in Italy meant at this epoch&nbsp;to be a man acquainted with the rudiments at least of&nbsp;scholarship, refined in diction, capable of corresponding or of speaking in choice phrases, open to the beauty of the arts, intelligently&nbsp;interested in archaeology, taking for his models of conduct the great&nbsp;men of antiquity rather than the saints of the church. He was also&nbsp;expected to prove himself an adept in physical exercises and in the&nbsp;courteous observances which survived from chivalry. The type&nbsp;is set before us by Castiglione in that book upon the courtier which&nbsp;went the round of Europe in the 16th centuiy. It is further emphasized in a famous passage, of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Orlando Innamorato</span><span class="font1"> where&nbsp;Boiardo compares the Italian ideal of an accomplished gentleman&nbsp;with the coarser type admired by nations of the north. To this&nbsp;point the awakened intelligence of the Renaissance, instructed by&nbsp;humanism, polished by the fine arts, expanding in genial conditions&nbsp;of diffused wealthy had brought, the Italians at a period when the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rest of Europe was comparatively barbarous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This picture has undoubtedly a darker side. Humanism, in its revolt against the middle ages, was, as we have seen already,&nbsp;mundane, pagan, irreligious, positive. The Renaissance&nbsp;can, after all, be regarded only as a period of transition&nbsp;in which much of the good of the past was sacrificed while&nbsp;some of the evil was retained, and neither the bad nor the&nbsp;good of the future was brought clearly into fact. Beneath&nbsp;the surface of brilliant social culture lurked gross appetites&nbsp;and savage passions, unrestrained by medieval piety, untutored&nbsp;by modern experience. Italian society exhibited an almost unexampled spectacle, of literary, artistic and courtly refinement&nbsp;crossed by brutalities of lust, treasons, poisonings, assassinations,&nbsp;violence. A succession of worldly pontiffs brought the church into&nbsp;flagrant discord with the principles of Christianity. Steeped in&nbsp;pagan learning, emulous of imitating.the manners of the ancients,&nbsp;used to think and feel in harmony with Ovid and Theocritus, and&nbsp;at the same time rendered cynical by the corruption of papal Rome,&nbsp;the educated classes lost their grasp upon morality. Political&nbsp;honesty ceased almost to have a name in Italy. The Christian&nbsp;virtues were scorned by the foremost actors and the ablest thinkers&nbsp;of the time, while the antique virtues were themes for rhetoric&nbsp;rather than moving-springs of conduct. This is apparent to all&nbsp;students of Machiavelli and Guicciardini, the profoundest analysts&nbsp;of their age, the bitterest satirists of its vices, but themselves infected with its incapacity for moral goodness. Not only were the&nbsp;Italians, vitiated; but they had also become impotent for action&nbsp;and resistance. At the height of the Renaissance the five great&nbsp;powers in the peninsula formed a confederation of independent&nbsp;but mutually attractive and repellent states. Equilibrium was&nbsp;maintained by diplomacy, in which the humanists played a foremost part, casting a network of intrigue over the nation which&nbsp;helped in no small measure to stimulate intelligence and create a&nbsp;common medium of culture, but which accustomed statesmen to&nbsp;believe that everything could be achieved by wire-pulling. Wars,&nbsp;were conducted on a showy system by means of mercenaries, who&nbsp;played a safe game in the field and developed a system of bloodless campaigns. Meanwhile the people grew up unused to arms.&nbsp;When Italy between the years 14^4 and 1530 became the battlefield of French, German and Spanish forces, it was seen to what a&nbsp;point of helplessness the political, moral and social conditions of&nbsp;the Renaissance had brought the nation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was needful to study at some length the main phenomena of the Renaissance in Italy, because the history of that phase&nbsp;of evolution in the other Western races turns almost&nbsp;entirely upon points in which they either adhered&nbsp;to or diverged from the type established there. Speaking broadly, what France, Germany, Spain and&nbsp;England assimilated from Italy at this epoch was in the&nbsp;first place the new learning, as it was then called.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This implied the new conception of human life, the new interest in the material universe, the new&nbsp;method of education, and the new manners, which we have&nbsp;seen to be inseparable from Italian humanism. Under these&nbsp;forms of intellectual enlightenment and polite culture the&nbsp;renascence of the human spirit had appeared in Italy, where it&nbsp;was more than elsewhere connected with the study of classical&nbsp;antiquity. But that audacious exploratory energy which&nbsp;formed the motive force of the Renaissance as distinguished&nbsp;from the Revival of Learning took, as we shall see, very different&nbsp;directions in the several nations who now were sending the&nbsp;flower of their youth to study at the feet of Italian rhetoricians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Renaissance ran its course in Italy with strange indifference to consequences. The five great powers, held in equilibrium by Lorenzo de’ Medici, dreamed that the peninsula could be&nbsp;maintained </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in statu quo</span><span class="font0"> by diplomacy. The church saw no&nbsp;danger in encouraging a pseudo-pagan ideal of life, violating&nbsp;its own principle of existence by assuming the policy of an&nbsp;aggrandizing secular state, and outraging Christendom openly&nbsp;by its acts and utterances. Society at large was hardly aware&nbsp;that an intellectual force of stupendous magnitude and incalculable explosive power had been created by the new learning.&nbsp;Why should not established institutions proceed upon the&nbsp;customary and convenient methods of routine, while the delights&nbsp;of existence were augmented, manners polished, arts developed,&nbsp;and a golden age of epicurean ease made decent by a state religion&nbsp;which no one cared to break with because no one was left to&nbsp;regard it seriously? This was the attitude of the ItaHans when&nbsp;the Renaissance, which they had initiated as a thing of beauty,&nbsp;began to operate as a thing of power beyond the Alps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Germany was already provided with universities, seven of which had been founded between 1348 and 1409. In these haunts of&nbsp;learning the new studies took root after the year 1440,&nbsp;chiefly through the influence of travelling professors, Peter&nbsp;Luder and Samuel Karoch. German scholars made their&nbsp;way to Lombard and Tuscan lecture-rooms, bringing back&nbsp;the methods of the humanists. Greek, Latin and Hebrew&nbsp;erudition soon found itself at home on Teutonic soil. Like Italian&nbsp;men of letters, these pioneers of humanism gave a classic turn to&nbsp;their patronymics; unfamiliar names, Crotus Rubeanusand Pierius&nbsp;Graecus, Capnion and Lupambulus Ganymedes, Occolampadius and&nbsp;Mclanchthon, resounded on the Rhine. A few of the German&nbsp;princes, among whom Maximilian, the prince cardinal Albert of&nbsp;Mainz, Frederick the Wise of Saxony, and Eberhard of Württemberg deserve mention., exercised a not insignificant influence on&nbsp;letters by the foundation of new universities and the patronage of&nbsp;learned men. The cities of Strassburg, Nuremberg, Augsburg, Basel,&nbsp;became centres of learned coteries, which gathered round scholars,&nbsp;like Wimpheling, Brant, Peutinger, Schedel, and Pirckheimer,&nbsp;artists like Dürer and Holbein, printers of the eminence of Froben.&nbsp;Academies in imitation oMtalian institutions came into existence,&nbsp;the two most conspicuous, named after the Rhine and the Danube,&nbsp;holding their headquarters respectively at Heidelberg and Vienna.&nbsp;Crowned poets, of whom the most eminent was Conrad Celtes Pro-tucius (Pickel!), emulated the fame of Politian and Pontano. Yet,&nbsp;though the Renaissance was thus widely communicated to the&nbsp;centres of German intelligence, it displayed a different character&nbsp;from that which it assumed in Italy. Gothic art, which was indigenous in Germany, yielded but little to southern influences.
