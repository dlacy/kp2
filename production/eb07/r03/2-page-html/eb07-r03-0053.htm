<p><span class="font0">1791. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;March 25th-31st, the campaign opened by the&nbsp;'troops under Prince Potemkin, not far from Brailof, when&nbsp;the Turks were defeated in several battles, in which they&nbsp;I lost upwards of four thousand men.

August 15th, 16th, at Pilnitz, near Dresden, a congress was&nbsp;held by the emperor of Germany, the king of Prussia, the&nbsp;elector of Saxony, the Count d’Artois, &amp;c. &amp;c. One of the&nbsp;most important events in this year was the death of Prince&nbsp;Potemkin, at Yassy in Moldavia, on the 15th October.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1792. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early in this year Bulgakoff<sub>1</sub> the Russian minister&nbsp;•at Warsaw, declared war against Poland ; and the Polish&nbsp;<sup>-</sup> patriots raised an army in which Thaddeus Kosciuszko soon</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">bore a conspicuous part.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1788, the diet of Poland had abrogated the constitution which the empress of Russia had, in 1775, compelled that nation to adopt, and had formed an alliance with the&nbsp;king of Prussia, by way of defence against the further encroachments of the Russian despot. Three years after, viz.&nbsp;on the 3d of May 1791, the new constitution, which was intended further to destroy the ambitious hopes of Catherine,&nbsp;was decreed at Warsaw. (See Poland.) These were affronts which the Russian empress could not forgive, and in&nbsp;one of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Conciliabula,</span><span class="font0"> in which the ministers of state, and&nbsp;the favourite for the time being, sat to regulate the affairs&nbsp;of the north of Europe, and to determine the fate of the&nbsp;surrounding nations, the annihilation of the Polish monarchy was resolved on.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">The declaration of war above mentioned was denounced by Bulgakoff at an assembly of the diet- That body received the declaration with a majestic calmness, and resolved to take measures for the defence of the nation. The&nbsp;generous enthusiasm of liberty soon spread throughout the&nbsp;state, and even the king pretended to share in the general indignation. An army was hastily collected, and the&nbsp;command of it bestowed on Prince Joseph Poniatowsky,&nbsp;a general whose inexperience and frivolous pursuits were&nbsp;but ill adapted to so important a charge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the mean time several Russian armies were preparing to overwhelm the small and disunited forces of the Poles.&nbsp;A body of eighty thousand Russians extended itself along&nbsp;the Bog, another of ten thousand was collected in the environs of Kief, and a third of thirty thousand penetrated into Lithuania. While these armies were carrying murder and&nbsp;desolation throughout the Polish territories, Catherine was&nbsp;employing all her arts to induce the neighbouring powers to&nbsp;join in the partition of Poland ; and in this she was but too&nbsp;successful. A treaty was accordingly concluded between&nbsp;the empress and the king of Prussia, by which each appropriated to itself a share of the remains of Poland. Stanislas Augustus, the powerless head of that state, was prevailed on to make a public declaration that there was a necessity for yielding to the superiority of the Russian arms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1793. On the 9th of April the Polish confederation of the partisans of Russia assembled at Grodno ; and on this&nbsp;occasion the Russian general placed himself under the canopy of that throne which he was about to declare for&nbsp;ever vacant, and the Russian minister Sievers produced a&nbsp;manifesto, declaring the intention of his mistress to incorporate with her domains all the Polish territory which her&nbsp;arms had conquered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Russian soldiers dispersed throughout the provinces committed depredations and ravages of which history furnishes but few examples. Warsaw became especially the&nbsp;theatre of their excesses. Their general, Igelstrom, who&nbsp;governed in that city, connived at the disorders of the soldiers, and made the wretched inhabitants feel the whole&nbsp;weight of his arrogance and barbarity. The patriots of&nbsp;Poland had been obliged to disperse, their property was&nbsp;confiscated, and their families reduced to servitude. Goaded by so many calamities, they once more took the resolution to free their country from the oppression of the Russians, or perish in the attempt. Some of them assembled,&nbsp;and sent an invitation to Kosciuszko, to come and lead them&nbsp;on against the invaders of their freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Kosciuszko had retired to Leipsig, with a few other Poles, all eminent for patriotism and military ardour. These hesitated not a moment in giving their approbation to the resolution adopted by their indignant countrymen ; but they&nbsp;were sensible that, in order to succeed, they must begin by&nbsp;emancipating the peasants from the state of servitude under&nbsp;which they then groaned. Kosciuszko and Zagonchek repaired with all expedition to the frontiers of Poland, and the&nbsp;latter proceeded to Warsaw, where he held conferences with&nbsp;the chief of the conspirators, and particularly with several&nbsp;officers, who declared their detestation of the Russian yoke.&nbsp;All appeared ripe for a general insurrection ; and the Russian commanders, whose suspicions had been excited by&nbsp;the appearance of Kosciuszko on the frontiers, obliged that&nbsp;leader and his confederates to postpone for a time the execution of their plan. In order to deceive the Russians, Kos-ciuszko retired into Italy, and Zagonchek repaired to Dresden, whither Ignatius Potoski and Kolontay had gone before him. On a sudden, however, Zagonchek appeared again&nbsp;at Warsaw, but was impeached by the king to General&nbsp;Igelstrom, and, in a conference with the general, was ordered to quit the Polish territory. He must now have&nbsp;abandoned his enterprise altogether, or immediately proceed to open insurrection. He chose the latter.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
