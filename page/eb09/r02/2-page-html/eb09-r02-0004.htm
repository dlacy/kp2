<p><span class="font2">Os quadratum suturally connected with the skull. The premaxillary bones are separate, and the rami of the&nbsp;lower jaw united in front by cartilage only. Form of the&nbsp;teeth variable ; they are not anchylosed to the bone. Two&nbsp;pairs of limbs are present, of which the hinder pair is the&nbsp;longer and larger, and generally ambulatory. The structure of the pelvis and hind limbs partly Ornithic ; the&nbsp;pelvic bones are not coalesced with each other or with the&nbsp;sacrum ; the pubis enters into the formation of the acetabulum, and the ilium is prolonged forwards in front of&nbsp;the acetabulum ; ischia united in a median ventral&nbsp;symphysis. The head of the femur is placed at a right&nbsp;angle to the condyles ; tibia with a procnemial crest, and a&nbsp;ridge for the fibula, which is complete. The proximal&nbsp;row of tarsals is formed by the astragalus and calcanéum&nbsp;only, and the former sometimes anchylosed with the tibia,&nbsp;thus forming the upper portion of the ankle-joint.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1">All the Dinosaurian remains known at present belong to the Mesozoic age ; they appear first in the Triassic, but the majority from these&nbsp;formations are so fragmentary that their classification is subject to&nbsp;much uncertainty.

In the Jurassic these Reptiles attained&nbsp;their greatest development, Marsh distinguishing among the fossils of&nbsp;this period four orders with numerous families. The largest exceeded&nbsp;auy other land animal in size, and measured from 50 to 80 feet.&nbsp;Dinosaurs continued to the end of the Cretaceous period, and some&nbsp;genera became highly specialized, although none attained to the same&nbsp;large size as some of the Jurassic forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The disproportion in length and strength between the fore and hind limbs clearly shows that the mode of progression differed widely from&nbsp;that of ordinary Reptiles, and was bipedal at least in some of the genera.&nbsp;In assuming an erect position, their long tail assisted them in balancing the body.
