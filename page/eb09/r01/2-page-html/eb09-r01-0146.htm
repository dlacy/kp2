<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the country; he accepted with expressions of favour the dedication to himself by Zwingli of the latter’s treatise&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">On True and False Religion.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> His sister corresponded&nbsp;with Melanchthon and was openly assailed by the Sorbonne&nbsp;as a favourer of heresy, while, as the mother of Jeanne&nbsp;d’Albret, her memory was always cherished with peculiar&nbsp;regard by the great Huguenot party. But the loss of&nbsp;prestige which Francis incurred by his defeat at Pavia&nbsp;and his subsequent captivity inspired the Ultramontane&nbsp;party with greater confidence, and, in spite of his efforts,&nbsp;Louis de Berquin, a leader of the Reformers and one of&nbsp;the most eminent scholars in France, perished at the stake&nbsp;in 1529. The policy of Francis was indeed mainly dictated by one dominant motive—that of personal hostility&nbsp;to the emperor—and the apparent caprice with which he&nbsp;treated the Reformers was the result to no small extent&nbsp;of this feeling. It now became his aim to conciliate Pope&nbsp;Clement as an ally against his great rival, and with this&nbsp;view he took advantage of certain excesses committed by&nbsp;a few fanatics, after the example of Miinzer, to light the&nbsp;fires of persecution. At the same time, therefore, that he&nbsp;was supporting the League of Schmalkald he was burning&nbsp;heretics in his own dominions. On the death of Clement&nbsp;(September 1534), when he found the hopes which he had&nbsp;founded on an alliance with the Medici extinguished,&nbsp;since Paul III. proved less amenable to his plans, he again&nbsp;changed his tactics : he invited Melanchthon to come and&nbsp;take up his residence in France, and he set at liberty&nbsp;those who had been imprisoned for holding the Reformed&nbsp;doctrines. At the peace of Crespy (1544), again, he once&nbsp;more changed his policy, and sought to arrive at an agreement with Charles for the suppression of heresy and the&nbsp;restoration of discipline in the church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">At the period at which we have now arrived the main influences which guided the later history of the Reformation may be discerned in full activity. Largely political&nbsp;almost from the commencement of the movement, they&nbsp;continued more and more to partake of that character or&nbsp;became mingled with elements not less secular. Foremost&nbsp;among these latter must be placed the appeal made to&nbsp;baser motives both in Germany and in England, by the&nbsp;manner in which the nobility of both countries were bribed&nbsp;to acquiesce in the suppression of the religious orders, by&nbsp;being allowed to become large sharers in the property and&nbsp;revenues of the monastic and conventual foundations.&nbsp;Among the lower classes, on the other hand, who were&nbsp;often painfully reminded of the loss they had sustained in&nbsp;the withdrawal of that charity which, amid all the degeneracy of the monasteries, had still been one of their&nbsp;recognized functions, a certain genuine sympathy with&nbsp;Catholicism and traditional regard for its institutions long&nbsp;continued to survive. But even among these classes men&nbsp;could not but be conscious that a higher standard of belief&nbsp;and practice had been introduced by the Reformation, while&nbsp;the superior ability shown by those who preached its doctrines, in adapting their discourse to the comprehension&nbsp;and spiritual needs of the pool’, invested them with a&nbsp;highly effective influence.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">it In Germany the policy of the emperor, nearly always ambiguous, became complicated with new difficulties.&nbsp;Charles himself, from political motives, appears at this&nbsp;time to have been really desirous of bringing about a&nbsp;termination of the prevailing religious controversies, but&nbsp;his vice-chancellor, Held, on whom it devolved to carry&nbsp;out his intentions, pursued a singularly infelicitous line of&nbsp;action, which ultimately led to the formation of the League&nbsp;of Nuremberg (10th June 1538), whereby Ferdinand, the&nbsp;duke of Bavaria, Henry of Brunswick, Albert of Brandenburg, and George of Saxony entered into a combination&nbsp;for the purpose of opposing the League of Schmalkald.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Dissatisfied with such a result, Charles next endeavoure( to bring about an understanding by a series of conferences&nbsp;and Paul III. was induced to send his legate to attend </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">diet in Ratisbon (29th July 1541), where a project fo:&nbsp;reunion, know׳n as the Ratisbon Interim, w׳as brought unde:&nbsp;formal discussion. “ It resulted,” says Gieseler, “ as befori&nbsp;at Augsburg : they quickly came together on merely specu&nbsp;lative formulas; but as soon as they touched upon the ex&nbsp;ternal constitution and ordinances relating to the authority&nbsp;of the church the division remained.” It was the last&nbsp;perhaps the only occasion, on wdiich an influential sectior&nbsp;on both sides (the party that followed Paul III. and tin&nbsp;party that followed Melanchthon) w<sup>r</sup>as animated by a genu&nbsp;ine desire for reconciliation. Their design was defeatet&nbsp;by the ignoble political aims of Francis on the one hand&nbsp;and by the theological illiberality of Luther and the electoi&nbsp;of Saxony on the other. In the meantime Protestantisn&nbsp;continued to advance: Hermann von Wied, elector o:&nbsp;Cologne, became a supporter of its doctrines; and Pomer&nbsp;ania, Anhalt, Mecklenburg, and the imperial cities wen&nbsp;added to the territories in which it became the dominanl&nbsp;faith. It w׳as at this juncture, when the Reformation ir&nbsp;Germany may be considered to have advanced to its high&nbsp;est point, that Paul III. brought fonvard a proposal foi&nbsp;assembling a general council,—a proposition to which il&nbsp;was decided by the Protestant party at the diet of Worms&nbsp;(March 1545) not to accede, inasmuch as it would be £&nbsp;council convened by the pope. In the following December,&nbsp;however, the council (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Trent, Council of) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">assembled,&nbsp;—th. publication, in the meantime, of Luther’s pamphlel&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Against the Popedom at Rome</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">founded by the Devil</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, having&nbsp;further contributed to foster theological rancour. The&nbsp;deliberations of this famous assembly resulted, as is w־el&nbsp;known, in the enactment of a series of canons condemnatory of Protestant doctrine</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and in this manner the&nbsp;hopes which down to this time had been cherished oi&nbsp;bringing about a compromise with respect to those articles&nbsp;of faith on which agreement had before seemed not unattainable were finally extinguished.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Two months after the first assembling of the council oi Trent Luther died. His latter days had been embittered&nbsp;by the defection (as he regarded it) of Melanchthon to a&nbsp;hostile camp, in the espousal by the latter of the tenets&nbsp;maintained by (Ecolampadius and Bucer. The doctrine&nbsp;of the church having now been once more defined by the&nbsp;Tridentine decisions, the emperor, in the confident belief&nbsp;that theological divergence might be expected soon to&nbsp;cease, next turned his attention to the removal of those&nbsp;abuses in matters of discipline which he held to be the&nbsp;chief obstacle to the return of Protestants to the church.&nbsp;With this view he brought about the acceptance of the&nbsp;Augsburg Interim (15th May 1548) by the diet, a compromise which, while it roused the susceptibilities of the&nbsp;pope, altogether failed to meet the conscientious scruples&nbsp;of the Protestant party. In its place Melanchthon and&nbsp;Duke Maurice of Saxony put forth the Leipsic Interim, a&nbsp;singular admixture of Lutheran doctrine and Roman ritual,&nbsp;which subsequently gave rise to the controversy with the&nbsp;Adiaphorists. The imperial design, of thus bringing about&nbsp;the extinction of Protestantism either by coercion or by&nbsp;conciliatory measures, may be held to have been finally&nbsp;defeated at the diet of Augsburg (1555), when it was&nbsp;decided not only that every ruler of a separate state should&nbsp;henceforth be at liberty to adopt either the Augsburg&nbsp;Confession (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">supra)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> or the Catholic faith as his personal&nbsp;creed, but that his subjects should also be called upon to&nbsp;conform to the profession of their temporal head. The&nbsp;effects of this arrangement cannot be held to have been&nbsp;beneficial. Wherever, as was not seldom the case, the&nbsp;ruler of one principality embraced a different doctrine</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
