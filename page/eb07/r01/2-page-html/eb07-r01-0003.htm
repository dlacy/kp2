<p><span class="font0">makes but a sorry jest in the hands of those who first built up a theory of his character according to an idea of their&nbsp;own, and then fabricated anecdotes to support and illustrate&nbsp;it. Rabelais’ judgment, it is certain, was quite as powerful&nbsp;as his wit ; and he knew too well when to discharge his&nbsp;bolt with effect, ever to let it fly where detriment to the&nbsp;archer himself could alone be the result. The veil of extravagance, which he has thrown over his great satirical&nbsp;work, is the best possible proof how unlikely he was to be&nbsp;guilty of any such piece of superfluous imprudence. At&nbsp;the same time, it is to be remarked further, in confutation&nbsp;of this particular Story, that it was to Clement VIL and&nbsp;not to Paul III., that Du Bellay must have been introduced&nbsp;in the capacity of ambassador on the occasion alluded to ;&nbsp;but, as invention and historical truth are two distinct things,&nbsp;this discrepancy in fact is not greatly to be wondered at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rabelais seems to have gone back to Lyons fora time, as his Epistle Dedicatory to Du Bellay of his edition of Marhanfs&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Antiquitates Romœ Antiquœ</span><span class="font0"> is dated from that city on the&nbsp;3lst of August 1534. He returned shortly afterwards to&nbsp;Rome, and rejoined Du Bellay, who had been created Cardinal on the 21st of May 1535. His letters to Godefroy&nbsp;D’Estissac, whose favour he had won during his residence at&nbsp;his Abbey of Maillezais, and continued ever afterwards to retain, are dated from Rome during the two following years.&nbsp;Availing himself of the opportunity which his presence on the&nbsp;spot afforded, he petitioned Pope Paul III. to be absolved&nbsp;from the penalties incurred by the abandonment of his order.&nbsp;Rabelais’ merits had secured him the esteem of Cardinals&nbsp;de Genutiis and Simonetta, and they combined with Du&nbsp;Bellay and the Bishop of Mascon, in forwarding his petition.&nbsp;By their exertions a bull in his favour was obtained gratis,&nbsp;contrary to the usual practice. It was granted on the 17th of&nbsp;January 1536, in terms of his request, allowing him to return&nbsp;into any house of the Benedictine order that would receive&nbsp;him, and to practise physic upon condition of his doing so&nbsp;without hope of fee or reward. This release from the&nbsp;ecclesiastical disabilities consequent upon his transgression&nbsp;of the church’s rules enabled the Cardinal Du Bellay to&nbsp;assign him a place in his Abbey of St. Maur des Fossez,&nbsp;near Paris. Here he remained until the year 1542, when&nbsp;he was appointed by the same friend to the cure of Meu-don ; and he continued in the zealous discharge of the&nbsp;duties of this station down to the time of his death. “Ever&nbsp;mindful,” says Niceron, “ to instruct his people, he made&nbsp;it part of his care to give their children a knowledge of&nbsp;church music, of which he was himself a thorough master.&nbsp;His house was ever open to the poor and wretched, whom&nbsp;he assisted to the utmost of his means ; and he was in the&nbsp;habit of drawing men of learning and science about him,&nbsp;to discourse with them upon their several pursuits. Against&nbsp;women, however, his gates were barred, and his reputation&nbsp;on this score is wholly without blemish. This,” he adds,&nbsp;“ is the uniform testimony of contemporary biographers ;&nbsp;and Antony Le Roi, who wrote a life of him in 1649, avers&nbsp;that such was then the prevailing tradition at Meudon. His&nbsp;knowledge of medicine rendered him doubly useful to his&nbsp;parishioners, who invariably found him ready to minister to&nbsp;their wants both corporal and spiritual.” He died in Paris,&nbsp;in 1553, in the Rue des Jardins, parish of St. Paul, and was&nbsp;buried in the cemetery of that church.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His death-bed has not escaped profanation by the caterers for the jest-books ; and there are few stories more common, than his calling for his domino, when he felt his end approaching, with the words, “ Beati qui in Domino moriuntur.” Another anecdote, even more detrimental to his&nbsp;character, is in every-day circulation, by which he is reported&nbsp;to have replied to a page sent by Du Bellay to inquire&nbsp;after his health, “ Tell your master the state you find me&nbsp;in ; I am going in quest of a Great Perhaps. He is up in&nbsp;the jay’s nest· Bid him keep where he is ; and for you, you&nbsp;will never be anything but a fool. Draw the curtain ; the&nbsp;farce is ended.” Those who have read Rabelais’ spirit&nbsp;aright need no confutation of this slanderous fabrication of&nbsp;monkish malice, the miserable patchwork from some half-dozen threadbare facetiæ. The simple fact recorded by&nbsp;Du Verdier, is worth a thousand such tales ; and it determines, if, indeed, such evidence were necessary, Rabelais’&nbsp;opinion as to the momentous doctrine which he is here represented to have viewed as no more than “a great perhaps.&quot;&nbsp;In a copy of Galen, annotated throughout in the handwriting of Rabelais, that had come into the Bishop of Evreux's&nbsp;possession, opposite a passage in which Galen argues for&nbsp;the mortality of the soul, Rabelais had wτitten, “ Hic vero&nbsp;Galenus se plumbeum ostendit.” Du Vertlier also states,&nbsp;whilst at the same time he retracts what he had formerly been&nbsp;led, in accordance with the popular voice, to say against&nbsp;Rabelais in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliothèque Française,</span><span class="font0"> that “ the manner&nbsp;of his death compels us to form a judgment of him totally&nbsp;at variance with that which is currently received.” The&nbsp;particular circumstances of this event are not now known,&nbsp;but they were doubtless such as became a pious and eminently thoughtful man.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">One cannot help regretting, with Coleridge, “ that no friend of Rabelais, and surely friend he must have had, has&nbsp;left an account of him.” Had any such account existed, it&nbsp;would unquestionably have conveyed an impression of his&nbsp;personal character very different from that which the current anecdotes of him are calculated to produce. It is the&nbsp;peculiar misfortune of distinguished humourists to have the&nbsp;paternity of such jests as are tossing unclaimed about the&nbsp;world laid to their charge. They become a sort of Foundling Hospitals for Wit ; and Rabelais has had more than his&nbsp;share of this abandoned progeny thrust upon him. His reputation as a man has suffered accordingly, and this for an&nbsp;obvious reason ; for just in the degree that a great man’s&nbsp;mind is marked by features, which puzzle the finest sagacity to discriminate and reconcile, are people disposed to&nbsp;pronounce an authoritative judgment regarding him. In&nbsp;all such cases, a lively anecdote, or sparkling witticism, is&nbsp;too cheap and pleasant a method of settling a doubtful character, not to be generally adopted. They commonly fall&nbsp;in with the conclusion that lies nearest the surface, and, being thus most easily come at, they are eagerly caught up&nbsp;and borne along from mouth to mouth, till their mere repetition sanctifies the delusion out of which they sprung. One&nbsp;common character runs throughout all the anecdotes of which&nbsp;Rabelais is the hero. They show a mind without gravity&nbsp;or depth, giving head to its most wayward sallies, neglectful&nbsp;of self-respect, and reckless of present circumstances, or of&nbsp;possible results. Such is just the character which a superficial observer is likely to form of him from his own romance. The rhodomantade, the coarseness, the downright&nbsp;nonsense, the reckless exuberance of humour, are easily&nbsp;noted ; whilst the vein of deep and earnest thought that ever&nbsp;and anon shows itself amid the surrounding extravagance,&nbsp;the infinite good sense, the high-toned and enlightened philanthropy, and the great moral purpose which the author had&nbsp;in view, escape the careless and unpenetrating eye. The&nbsp;vices, which he has laid bare with such masterly tact, have&nbsp;been set down as his own, and he is charged with having&nbsp;been a profligate, a debauchee, and a buffoon, destitute alike of&nbsp;self-respect, and reverence for whatsoever is sacred or noble.&nbsp;But every thing that is known of his life, as well as what&nbsp;may be inferred from a study of his works, goes to discountenance such a conclusion, He was beloved and respected by many of the most illustrious and virtuous prelates of his time, admitted into their most private councils,&nbsp;and charged with the most important trusts. All his works,&nbsp;except his romance, which, being a reflection of the time,&nbsp;must needs carry its grossness and licentiousness upon its front,&nbsp;are conceived </span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font0">a uniformly grave and learned spirit; and in</span></p>
