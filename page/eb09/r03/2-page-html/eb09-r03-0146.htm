                against the&nbsp;ancient Porta Esquilina of the Servian wall. It is built of
                travertine, is simple in design, with coarse details, and has a long inscription on
                its attic. The two side arches and pediment over the&nbsp;centre existed in the 16th

        <p><span class="font2">The column of Antoninus Pius was a monolith of red granite, erected
                after his death by his adopted sons Al. Aurelius and L.&nbsp;Verus. One fragment of
                it is preserved in the Vatican with an&nbsp;interesting quarry inscription,
                recording that it was cut in the ninth&nbsp;year of Trajan’s reign, under the
                supervision of Dioscurus and the&nbsp;architect Aristides. The rest of its fragments
                were used by Pius&nbsp;VI. to repair the obelisk of AIonte Citorio, set up by
                Augustus in&nbsp;the Campus AIartius as the gnomon of a sun-dial (Plin.,

                class="font2">xxxvi. 15). The marble pedestal of the Antonine column is now&nbsp;in
                the Vatican ; it has reliefs of the apotheosis of Faustina and&nbsp;Antoninus Pius,
                and processions of soldiers. This and the column&nbsp;of AI. Aurelius were both
                surmounted by colossal portrait statues&nbsp;of gilt bronze. The column of AL
                Aurelius is very similar in size&nbsp;and design to that of Trajan. Its spiral
                reliefs represent victories&nbsp;in Germany from 167 to 179, arranged in twenty
                tiers. Like the&nbsp;column of Trajan, it is exactly IOO Roman feet high, without
                the&nbsp;pedestal. The pedestal was originally much higher than at present,&nbsp;but
                is now partly buried ; it is shown by Gamucci, Du Perac, and&nbsp;other 16th-century
                writers. This column stood in front of a temple&nbsp;to AL Aurelius, and within a
                great peribolus, forming a forum&nbsp;similar to that of Trajan, though much smaller
                ; the remains of this&nbsp;temple probably form the elevation now called AIonte
                    Citorio.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p>

        <p><span class="font2">The recent discovery of a cemetery of prehistoric (Etruscan) date is
                mentioned above, p. 812. Few tombs exist of the Roman period&nbsp;earlier than the
                1st century </span><span class="font1">B. C. </span><span class="font2">,—probably
                owing to the great&nbsp;extension of the city beyond the Servian limits, which thus
                obliterated the earlier burial places. The tomb of the Cornelian Scipios&nbsp;is the
                most important of early date which still exists. It is excavated in the tufa rock at
                the side of the Via Appia, outside the&nbsp;Porta Capena. Interments of the Scipio
                family went on here for&nbsp;about 400 years, additional chambers and passages being
                excavated&nbsp;from time to time. The peperino sarcophagus of Cornelius
                Lucius&nbsp;Scipio Barbatus (Liv., x. 12, 13), consul in 298 b.c., is now in
                the&nbsp;Vatican ; its inscription, in rude Saturnian verse, is perhaps
                the&nbsp;most important existing specimen of early Latin epigraphy. _
                Alany&nbsp;other inscribed slabs were found in the 17th century, covering
                the&nbsp;“loculi” in which lay the bodies of later members of the

                .</span><span class="font2"> This&nbsp;burial-place of the Scipios is unlike those
                of other families, owing to&nbsp;the gens Cornelia keeping up the early custom of
                interment without&nbsp;burning ; thus stone sarcophagi or loculi (rock-cut recesses)
                were&nbsp;required instead of mere pigeon-holes to hold the cinerary urns.&nbsp;The
                tomb of Bibulus, a few yards outside the Porta Ratumena, and&nbsp;remains of two
                recently discovered during the destruction of the&nbsp;Aurelian towers at the Porta
                Salara, date from about the middle of&nbsp;the 1st century b.c., as does also the
                curious tomb of the baker&nbsp;Eurysaces outside the Porta AIaggiore. In 1863 an
                interesting&nbsp;tomb of the Sempronia gens was discovered on the Quirinal,
                below&nbsp;the royal palace, near the site of the Porta Sanqualis. It is
                of&nbsp;travertine, with a rich entablature and frieze sculptured with

        <p><span class="font2">The mausoleum of Augustus, built 28 b.c., stands in the north part of
                the Campus AIartius, between the Tiber and the Via&nbsp;Flaminia. It is a massive
                cylindrical structure of concrete, faced&nbsp;with opus reticulatum ; over that it
                was lined with marble slabs ;&nbsp;inside were a series of radiating chambers, in
                plan like a wheel.&nbsp;On the top was a great mound of earth, planted with trees
                and&nbsp;flowers (Tac., </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Ann.,</span><span class="font2"> iii. 9). As late as the 16th century its
                external&nbsp;form remained unaltered.@@<sup>8</sup> Only the bare core exists now,
                with its&nbsp;fine opus reticulatum, best seen in the court of the Palazzo
                Valdam-brini. The inside is concealed by modern seats, being used now as&nbsp;a
                circus (Teatro Correa). The sepulchral inscription in honour of&nbsp;Augustus,
                engraved on two bronze columns at the entrance, is preserved to us by its copy at
                Ancyra. It records an almost incredible&nbsp;amount of building : in addition to the
                long list of buildings mentioned by name Augustus says, </span><span class="font1"

            </span><span class="font2">The first buiial&nbsp;in the mausoleum of Augustus was that
                of AIarcellus, 22 B.O., and it&nbsp;continued to be the imperial tomb till the death
                of Nerva, 98 </span><span class="font1">A.D.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">after
                whose interment there w⅛s no more room. It was sacked by&nbsp;Alaric in 409, and in
                the 12th century was made into a fortress by&nbsp;the Colonna family, and suffered
                much from constant party struggles.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The mausoleum of Hadrian, begun in 135 as a substitute for that built
                by Augustus, was a large circular building on a square&nbsp;podium ; its walls, of
                enormous thickness, are of concrete faced&nbsp;with blocks of peperino, the whole
                being lined with Parian marble&nbsp;and surrounded by a colonnade with rows of
                statues,—a work of the&nbsp;greatest magnificence. The bronze pine-cone, now in the
                Vatican,&nbsp;was (according to Vacca) found near the mausoleum, and
                probably&nbsp;surmounted its conical dome. The splendour of the whole is described
                by Procopius (J5. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >G.,</span><span class="font2"> i. 22), who mentions its siege by the&nbsp;Goths,
                when the defenders hurled the statues on to the heads of&nbsp;the enemy. In the 6th
                century it was made into a papal castle&nbsp;called S. Angelus inter Nubes, and all
                through the Aliddle Ages&nbsp;it suffered much from constant attacks. The interior
                chambers are&nbsp;still well preserved, but its outside has been so often wrecked
                and&nbsp;refaced that little of the original masonry is visible.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Several of the grander sepulchral monuments of Rome were built in the
                form of pyramids. One of these still exists, included in the&nbsp;Aurelian wall, by
                the Porta Ostiensis. It is a pyramid of concrete,&nbsp;118 feet high, faced with
                blocks of white marble, and contains a&nbsp;small chamber decorated with painted
                stucco. An inscription in&nbsp;large letters on the marble facing records that it
                was built as a&nbsp;tomb for C. Cestius<sub>1</sub> a prætor, tribune of the people,
                and Septemvir&nbsp;of the epulones (officials who supervised banquets in honour of
                the&nbsp;gods)—an office founded in 196 b.c. (Liv., xxxiii. 42). It
                was&nbsp;erected, according to Cestius’s will, by his executors, in the
                space&nbsp;of 330 days. It dates from the time of Augustus@@<sup>10</sup> (see

                >Roma Aniica,</span><span class="font2"> iv. p. 1, ed. 1818-20). Another
                similar&nbsp;pyramid, popularly known as the tomb of Romulus, stood between&nbsp;the
                mausoleum of Hadrian and the basilica of St Peter. It was&nbsp;destroyed in the 15th
                century during the rebuilding of the long&nbsp;bridge which connects the former
                building with the Vatican.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The earliest bridge was a wooden drawbridge called the Pons Sublicius

                with apertures at intervals for ventilation.&nbsp;Many theories have been advanced
                to account for this enormous mass of broken&nbsp;pottery ; but by far the most
                probable explanation is that the broken earthenware of Rome was collected an&lt;l
                stored here for use in the making of the stucco&nbsp;called opus signinum (Vitr.,
                viii. 6, 14), with which the specus or channels&nbsp;of aqueducts were lined, and
                also the concrete in which marble and mosaic&nbsp;pavings were bedded (nucleus).
                Tliis latter is the opus testaceum of Vitruvius&nbsp;(vii. 1, 5) ; and the universal
                use of pounded earthenware for floors and aqueducts must have used up immense
                quantities of broken pots and bricks (teste&nbsp;tunsæ). A good account of the
                potsherds of Monte Testaccio and their stamps&nbsp;is given in </span><span
