            <p>ing. This was perhaps the firſt time that ever ſhe diſcovered a ſenſe of ſhame, and
                on this occaſion the power of wit was very conſpicuous: the wretch who had, without
                ſcruple, proclaimed herſelf an adultereſs, and who had firſt endeavoured to ſtarve
                her ſon, then to tranſport him, and afterwards to hang him, was not able to bear the
                repreſentation of her own conduct; but fled from reproach, though ſhe felt no pain
                from guilt; and left Bath with the utmoſt haſte, to ſhelter herſelf among the crowds
                of London @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(a).</hi></p>
            <p>Some time after this, Savage formed the reſolution of applying to the queen; who
                having once given him life, he hoped ſhe might farther extend her goodneſs to him by
                enabling him to ſupport it. —With this view, he publiſhed a poem on her birthday,
                which he entitled <hi rend="italic">The Volunteer-Laureat; </hi>for which ſhe was
                pleaſed to ſend him 501. with an intimation that he might annually expect the ſame
                bounty. But this annual allowance was nothing to a man of his ſtrange and Angular
                extravagance. His uſual cuſtom was, as ſoon as he had received his penſion, to
                diſappear with it, and ſecrete himſelf from his most intimate friends, till every
                ſhilling of the 501. was ſpent; which done, he again appeared, pennyleſs as before:
                But he would never inform any perſon where he had been, nor in what manner his money
                had been diſſipated. —From the reports, however, of ſome who found means to
                penetrate his haunts, it would ſeem that he expended both his time and his caſh in
                the moſt fordid and deſpicable ſenſuality; particularly in eating and drinking, in
                which he would indulge in the moſt unſocial manner, fitting whole days and nights by
                himſelf, in obſcure houſes of entertainment, over his bottle and trencher, immerſed
                in filth and ſloth, with ſcarce decent apparel; generally wrapped up in a horſeman’s
                great coat; and, on the whole, with his very homely countenance, and altogether,
                exhibiting an object the moſt diſguſting to the fight,
                if not to ſome</p>
            <p>other of the ſenſes.</p>
            <p>His wit and parts, however, ſtill raiſed him new friends as faſt as his miſhehaviour
                loſt him his old ones. Yet ſuch was his conduct, that occaſional relief only
                furniſhed the means of occaſional exceſs; and he defeated all attempts made by his
                friends to fix him in a decent way. He was even reduced ſo low as to be deſtitute of
                a lodging; inſomuch that he often paſſed his nights in thoſe mean houſes that are
                ſet open for caſual wanderers; ſometimes in cellars amidſt the riot and filth of the
                moſt profligate of the rabble; and not ſeldom would he walk the ſtreets till he was
                weary, and then lie down in ſummer on a bulk, or in winter with his aſſociates among
                the aſhes of a glaſs-houſe.</p>
            <p>Yet, amidſt all his penury and wretchedneſs, had this man ſo much pride, and ſo high
                an opinion of his own merit, that he ever kept up his ſpirits, and was always ready
                to repreſs, with ſcorn and contempt, the leaſt appearance of any flight or indignity
                towards himſelf, in the behaviour of his acquaintance; among whom he looked upon
                none as his ſuperior. He would be treated as an equal, even by perſons of the
                higheſt rank. We have an inſtance of this prepoſterous and inconſiſtent pride, in
                his refuſing to wait upon a gentleman who was deſirous of relieving him when at the
                loweſt ebb of diſtreſs, only becauſe the meſſage ſignified the gentleman’s deſire to
                ſee him at nine in the morning. Savage could not bear that any one ſhould preſume to
                preſcribe the hour of his attendance, and therefore he abſolutely rejected the
                proffered kindneſs. This life, unhappy as it may be already imagined, was yet
                rendered more unhappy, by the death of the queen, in 1738; which ſtroke deprived him
                of all hopes from the court. His penſion was diſcontinued, and the inſolent manner
                in which he demanded of Sir Robert</p>
            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@ (a)</hi> Mr Boſwell, in his life of Dr Johnſon, has called
                in queſtion the ſtory of Savage’s birth, and grounded his ſuſpicion on two miſtakes,
                or, as he calls them, falſehoods, which he thinks he has diſcovered in his friend’s
                memoirs of that extraordinary man. Johnſon has ſaid, that the earl of Rivers was
                Savage’s godfather, and gave him his own name; which, by his direction, was inſerted
                in the regiſter of the pariſh of St Andrew’s, Holborn. Part of this, it ſeems, is
                not true; for Mr Boſwell carefully inſpected that regiſter, but no ſuch entry is to
                be found. But does this omiſſion amount to a proof, that the perſon who called
                himſelf <hi rend="italic">Richard Savage</hi> was an impoſtor, and not the ſon of
                the earl of Rivers and the counteſs of Macclesfield? Mr Boſwell thinks it does; and,
                in behalf of his opinion, appeals to the maxim <hi rend="italic">falſum in uno,
                    falſum in omnibus.</hi> The ſolidity of this maxim may be allowed by others; but
                it was not without ſurpriſe that, on ſuch an occaſion, we found it adopted by the
                biographer of Johnſon. To all who have compared his view of a celebrated cauſe, with
                Stuart’s letters on the ſame ſubject addreſſed to Lord Mansfield, it muſt be
                apparent, that, at one period of his life, he would not have deemed a thouſand ſuch
                miſtakes ſufficient to invalidate a narrative otherwiſe ſo well authenticated as
                that which relates the birth of Savage. The truth is, that the omiſſion of the name
                in the regiſter of St Andrew’s may be eaſily accounted for, without bringing againſt
                the wretched Savage an accuſation of impoſture, which neither his mother nor her
                friends dared to urge when provoked to it by every poſſible motive that can
                influence human conduct. The earl of Rivers would undoubtedly give the direction
                about regiſtering the child’s name to the ſame perſon whom he entruſted with the
                care of his education; but that perſon, it is well known, was the counteſs of
                Macclesfield, who, as ſhe had reſolved from his birth to diſown her ſon, would take
                care that the direction ſhould not be obeyed.</p>
            <p>That which, in Johnſon’s life of Savage, Mr Boſwell calls a ſecond falſehood, ſeems
                not to amount even to a miſtake. It is there ſtated, that “Lady Macclesfield having
                lived for ſome time upon very uneaſy terms with her huſhand, thought a public
                confeſſion of adultery the moſt obvious and expeditious method of obtaining her
                liberty. ” This Mr Boſwell thinks cannot be true; becauſe, having peruſed the
                journals of both houſes of parliament at the period of her divorce, he there found
                it authentically aſcertained, that ſo far from voluntarily ſubmitting to the
                ignominious charge of adultery, ſhe made a ſtrenuous defence by her counſel. But
                what is this to the purpoſe? Johnſon has nowhere ſaid, that ſhe confeſſed her
                adultery at <pb n="668"> </pb>the bar of either houſe of parliament, but only that her
                confeſſion was <hi rend="italic">public;</hi> and as he has taught us in his
                Dictionary, that whatever is <hi rend="italic">notorious</hi> or <hi rend="italic"
                    >generally</hi> known is<hi rend="italic"> public;</hi> public, in his ſenſe of
                the word, that confeſſion certainly was, if made to different individuals, in ſuch a
                manner as ſhowed that ſhe was not anxious to conceal it from her huſband, or to
                prevent its notoriety. She might, however, have very cogent reaſons for denying her
                guilt before parliament, and for making a ſtrenuous defence by her counſel; as
                indeed, had ſhe acted otherwiſe, it is very little probable that her great fortune
                would have been reſtored to her, or that ſhe could have obtained a ſecond
                huſband.</p>
            <p>But Mr Boſwell is of opinion, that the perſon who aſſumed the name of Richard Savage
                was the ſon of the ſhoemaker under whoſe care Lady Macclesfield’s child was placed;
                becauſe “his not being able to obtain payment of Mrs Lloyd’s legacy mull be imputed
                to his conſciouſneſs that he was not the real perſon to whom that legacy was left.”
                He muſt have a willing mind who can admit this argument as a proof of impoſture. Mrs
                Lloyd died when Savage was in his 10th year, when he certainly did not know or
                ſuſpect that he was the perſon for whom the legacy was intended, when he had none to
                proſecute his claim, to ſhelter him from oppreſſion, or to call in law to the
                aſſiſtance of juſtice. In ſuch circumſtances he could not have obtained payment of
                the money, unleſs the executors of the will had been inſpired from heaven with the
                knowledge of the perſon to whom it was due.</p>
            <p>To theſe and a thouſand ſuch idle cavils it is a ſufficient anſwer, that Savage was
                acknowledged and patronized as Lady Macclesfield’s ſon by Lord Tyrconnel, who was
                that lady’s nephew; by Sir Richard Steel the intimate friend of colonel Brett, who
                was that lady’s ſecond huſband; by the Queen, who, upon the authority of that lady
                and her creatures, once thought Savage capable of entering his <hi rend="italic"
                    >mother’s</hi> houſe in the night with an intent to murder her; and in effect by
                    <hi rend="italic">the lady herſelſ,</hi> who at one time was prevailed upon to
                give him 501. and who fled before the Satire of the <hi rend="italic">Baſtard,</hi>
                without offering, either by herſelf or her friends, to deny that the author of that
                poem was the perſon whom he called himſelf, or to inſinuate ſo much as that he might
                    <hi rend="italic">poſſibly </hi>be the ſon of a ſhoemaker. To Mr Boſwell all
                this ſeems<hi rend="italic"> ſtrange:</hi> to others, who look not with ſo keen an
                eye for ſuppoſititious births, we think it muſt appear <hi rend="italic"
                    >convincing.</hi></p>
