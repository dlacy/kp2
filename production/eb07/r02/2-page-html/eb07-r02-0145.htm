<p><span class="font0">bility must have fallen into the hands of the combined forces ; but the tumultuous followers of Spartacus, longing&nbsp;for the pillage of the capital, compelled their leader to abandon his intention, and bend his course towards that devoted city. He was met and completely routed by tlle prætor&nbsp;Crassus, who thus acquired some renown in war, in addition to the influence which he possessed from his unequalled wealth. Pompey, on bis return from Spain, encountered&nbsp;and destroyed several scattered bodies of the gladiatorial&nbsp;army ; and thus, with his usual good fortune, obta⅛ed a&nbsp;claim to divide the honour with Crassus. From this period,&nbsp;these two powerful individuals cherished sentiments of envious rivalry against each other, the effect of which proved ruinous to the commonwealth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The enormous wealth of Crassus enabled him to purchase the support of the people, by bestowing upon them large donations of money and corn. To counterbalance his&nbsp;influence, Pompey, although attached to thearistocratic party,&nbsp;proposed the repeal of some of Sylla’s laws, and the enactment of others of a more popular character ; in particular,&nbsp;the restoration of the powers and privileges of the tribunes.&nbsp;By these means he so ingratiated himself with the people,&nbsp;that, with powers never before entrusted to any general,&nbsp;he obtained the command of the armament prepared against&nbsp;the pirates by which the seas were so greatly infested. In&nbsp;this war he distinguished himself in a very remarkable&nbsp;manner, by his skill, courage, and activity, and raised himself to a height of power and of military fame, at that time&nbsp;beyond all rivalry.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the progress of these events in Spain and Italy, Mithridates had renewed the war in Asia Minor. Lucullus, to whom the command in the Mithridatic war was now&nbsp;given, defeated the fleet of the Pontic king, relieved Cyzicus, and overthrew the combined forces of Mithridates and&nbsp;Tigranes in two great battles, bringing the struggle to the&nbsp;very brink of a successful conclusion. But the mutinous&nbsp;spirit of his own army, and the hostility which he aroused&nbsp;against himself, by his reform of the financial administration of the provinces, occasioned his recall. Pompey was&nbsp;next appointed to tlle command of the armies in Asia ; and&nbsp;thus again was he favoured by fortune to obtain the crowning glory of a victory already all but won. Mithridates&nbsp;finding all his efforts ineffectual, and being in danger of&nbsp;immediate captivity from the defection of his son-in-law,&nbsp;Tigranes, and the treason of his own son, Phraates, killed&nbsp;himself, that he might not fall into the hands of the Romans. After the conclusion of the war, Pompey spent some&nbsp;time in Asia, settling its affairs, and arranging it into different provincial districts. By the fall of Mithridates, and&nbsp;this settlement of Asiatic affairs, the republic may be considered to have reached the highest pitch of her power;&nbsp;but when the summit has been gained, the next step is inevitably downward. The very existence of the republic,&nbsp;as such, now depended, partly upon the caprice or the moderation of Pompey himself, partly upon the judicious or&nbsp;the erroneous measures which Crassus might adopt, in his&nbsp;endeavours to counterbalance the power of his mighty&nbsp;rival.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Unfortunately for Rome, the two rivals saw no better method of maintaining each his own influence in opposition&nbsp;to that of his antagonist, than by separately or jointly courting popularity. Pompey had led the way in tllis injudicious procedure, by his partial restoration of tne tribunitian&nbsp;power ; and this restoration was completed by the joint influence of him and Crassus during their united consulship.&nbsp;It had been found by ambitious men, that they could not&nbsp;obtain their objects of pursuit, whether those objects were&nbsp;chiefly aristocratic or democratic, without becoming demagogues ; and therefore unhappily it was considered by them&nbsp;necessary to re-establish in all its power an office, of which&nbsp;the very nature pointed it out for such a pernicious abuse.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">But as extremes in all things meet, these very demagogues necessarily became an oligarchy ; and while they pretended to promote the interests of the people, such men as&nbsp;Pompey and Crassus engrossed the whole powers and emoluments of the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Before this rivalry had reached its crisis, and during the absence of Pompey in Asia, Rome was threatened with a new convulsion, and new competitors for public favour began to appear on the scene. Lucius Sergius&nbsp;Catilina, a young man of noble birth, but of desperate fortunes, and of the most depraved character, formed a conspiracy to destroy the chief men of the state, seize on all&nbsp;public property, restore the Marian faction, and, placing&nbsp;himself at its nead, to invest himself with supreme power.&nbsp;Not only the profligate of the youthful nobility, and the indigent of the populace, joined in this conspiracy, but even&nbsp;Crassus and Julius Csesar were accused ofhaving been so&nbsp;far implicated in it. After several failures and postponements, the conspiracy was partly detected, and partly forced&nbsp;into a premature disclosure by the failure of Cataline in his&nbsp;attempt to obtain the consulship, and the prudent preventive measures of his successful rival, Cicero, who also at&nbsp;that time began to act a distinguished part in public affairs.&nbsp;Not all the daring, nor all the secret attempts of Cataline&nbsp;could overawe, or elude the energy and vigilance of Cicero ;&nbsp;and at length the desperate and baffled conspirator fled from&nbsp;the city, and raised the standard of revolt in Etruria. His&nbsp;associates in Rome were seized and put to death, and he&nbsp;w’as himself defeated and slain in a desperate battle, after&nbsp;having performed deeds of the most determined valour. So&nbsp;highly had Cicero distinguished himself by his detection&nbsp;and suppression of this dangerous conspiracy, that the senate unanimously bestowed upon him the honourable title&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Father ofhis Country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the progress, and in the suppression of this conspiracy, several very remarkable men had come prominently forward. These were Cicero, unmatched for eloquence, learning, and philosophical wisdom ; Cato, a true republican of the ancient mould, simple, severely virtuous, and&nbsp;uncompromising ; and Cæsar, unrivalled in the versatility,&nbsp;extent, and power of a genius, equally fitted to attain preeminence in the pursuits of literature, philosophy, politics,&nbsp;and war. The two former adhered to the aristocratic party&nbsp;in the state, who were headed by Pompey ; the latter made&nbsp;the democratic party the basis of his power, although he&nbsp;was himself descended from one of the most ancient and&nbsp;noble families of Rome. He had the address both to extricate himself from the conspiracy of Cataline, and to make&nbsp;himself at the same time the person to whom the survivors&nbsp;of that party looked for protection. From that period it&nbsp;was evident, that whatever might be the destinies of Rome,&nbsp;Cæsar must exercise a potent influence over them, for evil&nbsp;or for good.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The return of Pompey from Asia caused a renewal of the contest for power between that general and the party&nbsp;which sought to maintain the independence of the senate.&nbsp;Of this party, Cato, Lucullus, and Metellus, were the chief adherents; but their efforts only caused Pompey to throw his&nbsp;influence more into the popular scale, and thus unconsciously to promote the ambitious views of Cæsar. That&nbsp;sagacious man, perceiving the necessity of acquiring both&nbsp;the skill and the renown of a general, and having hitherto&nbsp;in a great measure abstained from military affairs, got himself appointed to the governorship of Lusitania, where he&nbsp;soon acquired a high reputation for warlike talents, and at&nbsp;the same time repaired his dilapidated fortunes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the absence of Cæsar, the contest between Pompey and Crassus continued, each endeavouring to weaken the influence of theother; and the independent party in the&nbsp;senate, led by Cato, and occasionally aided by Cicero, availing themselves of this struggle to diminish the undue power</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
