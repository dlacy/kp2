Sigiſmund, however, no sooner had time to recover himſelf, than he be ran to form new enterpriſes againſt the Swedes in Prusſia ; but Guſtavus ſetting ſail with his whole fleet for Dantzic, where the king of Poland then reſided, ſo broke his meaſures, that he was obliged to prolong the truce for another year. Sigiſmund, however, was not yet appriſed of the danger he was in, and refuſed to liſten to any terms of accommodation : upon which Guſtavus entering Livonia, defeated the Poliſh general, and took Derpt, Hockenhauſen, and ſeveral other places of leſs importance ; after which, entering Lithuania, he took the city of Birſen.</p><p>Notwithſtanding this ſucceſs, Guſtavus propoſed peace on the ſame equitable terms as before ; but Sigiſmund was ſtill infatuated with the hopes that, by means of the emperor of Germany, he ſhould be able to conquer Sweden. Guſtavus finding him inflexible, reſolved to puſh his good fortune. His generals Horn and Thurn defeated the Poles in Semigallia. Guſtavus himſelf with 150 ſhips let ſail for Pruſſia, where he landed at Pillaw. This place was immediately delivered up to him ; as were alſo Braunſherck, Frawenberg, Elbing, Marienberg, Mew, Dirſchau, Stum, Chriſtburg, &amp;c. Sigiſmund, alarmed at the great ſucceſſes of Guſtavus, ſent a body of forces to oppoſe him, and to prevent Dantzic from falling into his hands. In this he was attended with as bad ſucceſs as before. His troops were defeated before Marienberg, Mew, and Dirſchau; and in May 1627, Guſtavus arrived with freſh forces before Dantzic, which he would probably have carried, had he not been wounded in the belly by a cannon-ſhot. The Poles in the mean time recovered Mew ; and the States of Holland ſent ambaſſadors to mediate a peace between the two crowns. Sigiſmund, however, depending upon the assiſtance of the emperor of Germany and king of Spain, determined to hearken to no terms, and reſolved to make a winter campaign ; but Guſtavus was ſo well intrenched, and all his forts were ſo ſtrongly garriſoned, that the utmoſt efforts of the Poles were to no purpoſe @@(<hi rend="smallcaps">a).</hi> The city of Dantzic in the mean time made ſuch a deſperate reſiſtance as greatly irritated Guſtavus. In a ſea-engagement the Swediſh fleet defeated that of the enemy ; after which Guſtavus, having blocked up the harbour with his fleet, puſhed his advances on the land-ſide with incredible vigour. He made a ſurpriſing march over a moraſs 15 miles broad, aſſiſted by bridges of a peculiar conſtruction, over which he carried a ſpecies of light cannon invented by himſelf. By this unexpected manœuvre he got the command of the city in ſuch a manner, that the garriſon were on the point of ſurrendering, when, by a sudden ſwell of the Viſtula, the Swediſh works were ruined, and the king was obliged to raiſe the siege. In other reſpects, however, the affairs of Guſtavus went on with their uſual good fortune. His general Wrangel defeated the Poles before Brodnitz, of whom 3000 were killed, and 1000 taken priſoners, with five pieces of cannon and 2000 waggons loaden with provisions. At Stum the king gained another and more considerable victory in perſon. The emperor had ſent 5000 foot and 2000 horſe under Arnheim, who joined the main army commanded by the Poliſh general Coniecſpolſki, in order to attack the Swediſh army encamped at Quidzin. The enemy were ſo much ſuperior in number, that the friends of Guſtavus represented to him the imminent danger of attacking them. But the king being determined, the engagement began. The Swediſh cavalry charged with ſuch impetuoſity, contrary to their ſovereign’s expreſs order, that they were almoſt surrounded by the enemy ; but Guſtavus, coming up to their aſſiſtance, puſhed the enemy’s infantry with so much vigour, that they gave way, and retreated to a bridge they had thrown over the Werder. But here they were diſappointed ; for the Swedes had already taken poſſeſſion of the bridge. On this a new action enſued more bloody than the former, in which the king was expoſed to great danger, and thrice narrowly eſcaped being taken priſoner ; but at laſt the Poles were totally defeated, with the loſs of a great many men, 22 pair of colours, five ſtands, and ſeveral other military trophies. The ſlaughter of the German auxiliaries was ſo great, that Arnheim ſcarce carried off one half of the troops he brought into the field. This defeat did not hinder the Poliſh general from attempting the siege of Stum ; but here again he was attended by his uſual bad fortune. The garriſon ſallied out, and he was defeated with the loſs of 4000 men. The blame of this misfortune was laid upon Arnheim ; who was recalled, and ſucceeded by Henry of Saxe Lawenburg and Philip count Mansfeldt. The change of general officers, however, produced no good conſequences to the Poles ; a famine and plague raged in their camp, ſo that they were at laſt obliged to conſent to a truce for six years, to expire in the month of June 1635. The conditions were, that Guſtavus ſhould reſtore to Sigiſmund the towns of Brodnitz, Stum, and Dirſchau ; that Marienberg ſhould remain ſequeſtrated in the hands of the elector of Brandenburg, to be reſtored again to Sweden in case a peace was not concluded at the end of the six years. Guſtavus, on his side, kept the port and citadel of Memel, the harbour of Pillau, the town of Elbing, Brunſberg, and all that he had conquered in Livonia.</p><p>Guſtavus having thus brought the war with Poland to an honourable concluſion, began to think of relenting the conduct of the emperor in aſſiſting his enemies and oppreſſing the Proteſtant ſtates. Before embarking in ſuch an important undertaking, it was neceſſary that he ſhould conſult the diet. In this the propriety of engaging in a war with Germany was warmly debated ; but, after much altercation, Guſtavus in a very noble ſpeech determined the matter, and ſet forth in ſuch ſtrong terms the virtuous motives by which he was actuated, that the whole assembly wept, and every thing was granted which he could require.</p><p>It was not difficult for Guſtavus to begin his expedition. His troops amounted to 60,000 men, hardened by a ſucceſſion of ſevere campaigns in Ruſſia, Finland, Livonia, and Pruſſia. His fleet exceeded 70 ſail, carrying from 20 to 40 guns, and manned with 6000 mariners. Embarking</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">@@@(a)</hi> In this campaign the practice of duelling became ſo prevalent in the Swediſh army, as to engage the king’s attention, and to oblige him to ſuppreſs it by very rigorous edicts. Soon after theſe were paſſed, a quarrel arose between two general officers, who aſked his majeſty’s permiſſion to decide their difference by the laws of honour. The king conſented, but wiſhed to be a ſpectator of their courage. He went to the place appointed, attended by a body of guards :and having ordered the executioner to be called, “ Now gentlemen, ſaid he to the officers, fight until one dies ;” adding to the excutioner, “ Do you immediately cut off the head of the other.” On this the quarrel was dropped, and no more challenges were heard of in the camp.</p></body></text></TEI>
