Besides the candidates for holy orders, great numbers of the sons of good families from all parts of Spain are sent to this seminary to pass a few years ; and hence the number of the members of the university has at some periods amounted to more than four thousand. The regular inhabitants of the city, exclusive of the university, amount to 13,500 persons.</p><p>The cathedral is a fine object of the Gothic kind, though of no earlier erection than the reign of Charles I. of Spain, in the beginning of the sixteenth century ; and as at that period Gothic architecture was on the decline in Spain, it will not bear very rigid criticism. It is, however, a magnificent mass of building, and is adorned with paintings from the pencil of Titian, Spagnoletti, and some other great masters. The college formerly belonging to the order of Jesuits is a very large pile of building, now occupied by regular canons. The church, dedicated to St Mark, within it, has some of the best productions of the Spanish painter Mengs, but being a representation of the various parts of the life of Loyola, the founder of the order of Jesuits, whatever merit they may have as paintings, they have now none as historical pieces.</p><p>The principal square of Salamanca, in the centre of the city, is a fine object. The buildings that surround it are handsome and lofty, and supported by piazzas, under which is the principal public walk for the inhabitants. It is situated in latitude 4L 21. N.</p><p>SALAME, a small island at the entrance of the Persian Gulf, near Cape Mussendoon. Long. 56. 48. E. Lat. 26. 20. N.</p><p>SALAMIS, an island of the Archipelago, situated in long. 34. 0. E. and lat 37. 32. N. It was famous in antiquity for a battle fought there between the Greek and Persian fleets. In this engagement, which was one of the most memorable actions we find recorded in history, the Grecians lost forty ships, and the Persians two hundred, besides a great many more which were taken, with all the men and ammunition on board.</p><p>The island of Salamis is of a very irregular shape ; it was reckoned eight or ten miles in length, reaching west ward as far as the mountains called <hi rend="italic">Kerata</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The Horns.</hi> Pausanias informs us that on one side of this island stood in his time a temple of Diana, and on the other a trophy for a victory obtained by Themistocles, together with the temple of Cychreus, the site of which is now thought to be occupied by the church of St Nicholas.</p><p>The city of Salamis was demolished by the Athenians, because in the war with Cassander it surrendered, from disaffection, to the Macedonians. In the second century, when it was visited by Pausanias, some ruins of the Agora or market-place remained.</p><p>SALAYR <hi rend="smallcaps">Isle,</hi> an island in the Eastern Seas, situated off the southern extremity of Celebes, about the sixth degree of south latitude. This island is about forty miles in length by eight in average breadth ; and there are many smaller isles around it, two of which only are inhabited, namely, Bonarutte and Calawe. It is mountainous and woody, yet better cultivated and peopled than most of the</p><p>eastern isles. The principal produce is millet, which is the chief subsistence of the natives, and cotton, which is raised in a coarse manner. From this raw material coarse blue and white stripped cloths are manufactured, for internal consumption and for exportation. The inhabitants, according to the estimate of Captain Forrest, amount to about 60,000. They have good houses ; and the richer classes, in travelling, are carried in bamboo chairs over the hills, while horses are used in the level country. The island was ceded by the Macassars, who had obtained possession of it, to the king of Ternate, from whom it was taken by the Dutch East India Company. The Dutch had a junior resident here as merchant, who dwelt in a pallisadoed fort.</p><p>SALE is the exchange of a commodity for money ; barter, or permutation, is the exchange of one commodity for another.</p><p>SALEMI, a city of the island of Sicily, in the province of Mazzara. It stands on a healthy spot on the summit of a hill, which is the ancient Alicia or Halycus. It is surrounded with walls in a dilapidated state. It is on the decline, but still contains 9200 inhabitants, who are chiefly employed in agriculture, especially in producing the best oil, and in making excellent wire.</p><p>SALENGORE, a district in the Malay peninsula, extending along the Straits of Malacca, and governed by a Mahommedan chief, who bears the title of rajah. It is situated at no great distance from Prince of Wales’ Island, in which the trade of the place chiefly centres. Pepper, cloves, wild nutmegs, wax, nutmeg-oil, rattans, dammer, wood, oil, &amp;c., are imported in the Buggess prows ; and from a large river near to Salengore great quantities of long rattans are brought. The prince is the chief merchant, as in the other Malay principalities, monopolizing all the trade. Ships lying in the river are secure from pirates ; but in the road it is necessary to be on the alert against straggling prows, which are always ready to take advantage of unguarded ships. The Buggesses have still a small settlement here, and profess the Mahommedan religion.</p><p>SALEP, in the <hi rend="italic">Materia Medica,</hi> the dried root of a species of orchis. “ The restorative, mucilaginous, and demulcent qualitics of the orchis root, render it of considerable use in various diseases. In the sea-scurvy it powerfully obtunds the acrimony of the fluids, and at the same time is easily assimilated into a mild and nutritious chyle. In diarrhoeas and the dysentery it is highly serviceable, by sheathing the internal coat of the intestines, by abating irritation, and gently correcting putrefaction. In the symptomatic fever which arises from the absorption of pus from ulcers in the lungs, from wounds, or from amputation, sa- lep used plentifully is an admirable demulcent, and well adapted to resist the dissolution of the crasis of the blood, which is so evident in these cases. And by the same mucilaginous quality it is equally efficacious in the strangury and dysury, especially in the latter when arising from a venereal cause, because the discharge of urine is then attended with the most exquisite pain, from the ulccration about the neck of the bladder and through the course of the urethra. I have found it also an useful aliment for patients who labour under the stone or gravel.” (Dr Percival’s Essays, Medical and Experimental.) The ancient chemists appear to have entertained a very high opinion of the orchis root, as appears from the <hi rend="italic">Secreta Secretorum of</hi> Ray- mund Lully, a work dated 1565.</p><p>SALERNO, a city of Italy, the capital of the Neapolitan province Principato Citeriore. It stands on the sea-shore, in the bay of that name, between mountains and the two small rivers called Sele and Larino. It is surrounded with walls, and defended by a castle. An archbishop is situated here, with a fine cathedral, under which are the graves of the ancient kings of Lombardy, as well as of Pope Gregory VII. It contains seventeen parish and nineteen con-</p></body></text></TEI>
