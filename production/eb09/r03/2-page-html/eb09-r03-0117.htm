<p><span class="font0">His successor Nicholas V. (1447-55) was a scholar solely devoted to the patronage of literati and artists.&nbsp;During his reign there was a fresh attempt to restore the&nbsp;republic, but it was rather prompted by literary and&nbsp;classical enthusiasm than by any genuine patriotic ardour.&nbsp;Political passions and interests had ceased to exist. The&nbsp;conspiracy was headed by Stefano Porcari, a man of the&nbsp;f people, who claimed to be descended from Cato. He had&nbsp;once been captain of the people in Florence, and was made&nbsp;podestà of Bologna by Eugenius IV. He was a caricature&nbsp;of Cola di Rienzo, and extravagantly proud of his Latin&nbsp;speeches in honour of ancient republican liberty. The&nbsp;admiration of antiquity was then at its height, and Porcari&nbsp;found many enthusiastic hearers. Directly after the death&nbsp;of Eugenius IV. he made a first and unsuccessful attempt to&nbsp;proclaim the republic. Nevertheless Nicholas V., with the&nbsp;same indulgence for scholars that had prompted him to&nbsp;pardon Valla for denying the temporal power of the papacy&nbsp;and laughing to scorn the pretended donation of Constantine, freely pardoned Porcari and named him podestà of&nbsp;Anagni. He filled this office with credit, but on his&nbsp;return to Rome again began to play the agitator, and was&nbsp;banished to Bologna with a pension from the pope.&nbsp;Nicholas V. had conferred all the state offices upon priests&nbsp;and abbots, and had erected numerous fortresses. Hence&nbsp;there were many malcontents in Rome, in communication&nbsp;with Porcari at Bologna, and ready to join in his plot.&nbsp;Arms were collected, and on the day fixed he presented&nbsp;himself to his fellow-conspirators adorned with rich robes&nbsp;and a gold chain, and harangued them in Latin on the&nbsp;duty of freeing their country from the yoke of the&nbsp;priests. His design was to set fire to the Vatican on the&nbsp;6th January 1453, the feast of the Epiphany ; he and his&nbsp;followers were to seize the pope, the cardinals, and Castle&nbsp;St Angelo. But Nicholas received timely warning; the&nbsp;conspirators’ house was surrounded ; and Porcari himself&nbsp;was seized while trying to escape, confined in Castle St&nbsp;Angelo, and put to death with nine of his companions on&nbsp;the 9th January. Others shortly suffered the same fate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under Calixtus III. and Pius II. affairs went on quietly enough, but Paul II. (1464-71) had a somewhat&nbsp;troubled reign. Yet he was a skilled politician. He reordered the finances and the courts of justice, punished&nbsp;crime with severity, was an energetic foe to the Malatesta&nbsp;of Rimini, put an end to the oppression exercised in Rome&nbsp;by the wealthy and arrogant house of Anguillara, and kept&nbsp;the people in good humour with continual festivities.&nbsp;But—and this was a grave defect at that period—he&nbsp;extended no favour to learning, and, by driving many&nbsp;scholars from the curia to make room for his own kinsmen, brought a storm about his ears. At that time the&nbsp;house of Pomponio Leto was the rendezvous of learned&nbsp;men and the seat of the Roman Academy. Leto was an&nbsp;enthusiast of antiquity ; and, as the members of the&nbsp;Academy all assumed old Latin names, they were suspected&nbsp;of a design to re-establish paganism and the republican&nbsp;government. It is certain that they all inveighed against&nbsp;the pope ; and, as the latter was no man of half measures,&nbsp;during the carnival of 1468 he suddenly imprisoned twenty&nbsp;Academicians, and even subjected a few of them to torture.&nbsp;Pomponio Leto, although absent in Venice, was also&nbsp;arrested and tried ; but he exculpated himself, craved forgiveness, and was set at liberty. His friends were also released, for the charge of conspiracy proved to be unfounded.&nbsp;Certain members of the Academy, and notably Platina in&nbsp;his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lives of the Popes,</span><span class="font0"> afterwards revenged themselves by&nbsp;stigmatizing Paul II. as the persecutor of philosophy and&nbsp;letters. But he was no more a persecutor than a patron&nbsp;of learning ; he was a politician, the author of some useful&nbsp;reforms, and solely intent on the consolidation of his&nbsp;absolute power. Among his reforms may be classed the&nbsp;revision of the Roman statutes in 1469, for the purpose of&nbsp;destroying the substance while preserving the form of the&nbsp;old Roman legislation, and entirely stripping it of all&nbsp;political significance. In fact the pope’s will was now&nbsp;absolute, and even in criminal cases he could trample&nbsp;unhindered on the common law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There was still a senator of Rome, whose nomination was entirely in the hands of the pope, still three conservators, the heads of the rioni, and an elected council of&nbsp;twenty-six citizens. Now and then also a shadowy&nbsp;semblance of a popular assembly was held to cast dust in&nbsp;the eyes of the public, but even this was not for long. All&nbsp;these officials, together with the judges of the Capitol,&nbsp;retained various attributes of different kinds. They&nbsp;administered justice and gave sentence. There were&nbsp;numerous tribunals all with undefined modes of procedure,&nbsp;so that it was very difficult for the citizens to ascertain in&nbsp;which court justice should be sought. But in last resort&nbsp;there was always the supreme decision of the pope. Thus&nbsp;matters remained to the time of the French Revolution.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For the completion of this system a final blow had to be dealt to the aristocracy, whose power had been increased&nbsp;by nepotism ; and it was dealt by bloodshed under the&nbsp;three following popes—Sixtus IV. (1471-84), Innocent&nbsp;VIIL (1484-92), and Alexander VI. (1492-1503)—each&nbsp;of whom was worse than his predecessor. The first, by&nbsp;means of his nephews, continued the slaughter of the&nbsp;Colonna, sending an army against them, devastating their&nbsp;estates at Alarino, and beheading the protonotary Lorenzo&nbsp;Colonna. Innocent VIII. was confronted by the power of&nbsp;the Orsini, who so greatly endangered his life by their&nbsp;disturbances in the city that he was only saved by an&nbsp;alliance with Naples. Neither peace nor order could be&nbsp;lastingly established until these arrogant barons were&nbsp;overthrown. This task was accomplished by the worst of&nbsp;the three pontiffs, Alexander VI. All know how the massacre of the Orsini was compassed, almost simultaneously,&nbsp;by the pope in Rome and his equally iniquitous son, Cæsar&nbsp;Borgia, at Sinigaglia (1502). This pair dealt the last blow&nbsp;to the Roman aristocracy and the tyrants of Romagna, and&nbsp;thus the temporal dominion of the papacy was finally&nbsp;assured. The republic was now at an end ; it had shrivelled&nbsp;to a civil municipality. Its institutions, deprived of all&nbsp;practical value, lingered on like ghosts of the past, subject&nbsp;from century to century to unimportant changes. The history of Rome is henceforth absorbed in that of the papacy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Nevertheless the republic twice attempted to rise from its grave, and on the second occasion gave proofs of heroism&nbsp;worthy of its past. It was first resuscitated in February&nbsp;1798, by the influence of the French Revolution, and the&nbsp;French constitution of the year III. was rapidly imitated.&nbsp;Rome had again two councils—the tribunate and the senate,&nbsp;with five consuls constituting the executive power. But&nbsp;in the following year, owing to the military reverses of&nbsp;the French, the government of the popes was restored&nbsp;until 1809, when Napoleon I. annexed to his empire the&nbsp;States of the Church. Rome was then governed by a consulta Straordinaria—a special commission—with the municipal and provincial institutions of France. In 1814 the&nbsp;papal government was again reinstated, and the old&nbsp;institutions, somewhat modified on the French system,&nbsp;were recalled to life. Pius IX. (1846-77) tried to introduce fresh reforms, and to improve and simplify the old&nbsp;machinery of state ; but the advancing tide of the Italian&nbsp;revolution of 1848 drove him from Rome ; the republic&nbsp;was once more proclaimed, and had a brief but glorious&nbsp;existence. Its programme was dictated by Joseph AIazzini,&nbsp;who with Saffi and Armellini formed the triumvirate at&nbsp;the head of the Government. United Italy was to be a</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
