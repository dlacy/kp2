<p><label>REDENS</label>
Redans, or <hi rend="italic">Redant,</hi> in fortification, a kind of work indented in form of the teeth of a ſaw, with ſaliant and re-entering angles ; to the end that one part may flank or defend another. It is likewiſe called <hi rend="italic">ſaw-work</hi> and <hi rend="italic">indented work.</hi> The lines or faces in this flank one another.</p><p>Redens are uſed in fortifying walls, where it is not neceſſary to be at the expence of building baſtions ; as when they ſtand on the ſide of a river running through a garrifon town, a marſh, the ſea, &amp;c. But the fault of ſuch fortification is, that the befiegers from one battery may ruin both the ſides of the tenaille or front of a place, and make an aſſault without fear of being enfiladed, ſince the defences are mined. The parapet of the corridor is likewiſe often redented or carried oa by the way of redens. The redens was ufed before baſtions were invented, and fome people think them preferable.</p>
