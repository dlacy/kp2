<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">practically non-existent. The counter testimony is, indeed, not very strong and still less detailed. But that is not the point. It&nbsp;is sufficient to say that there is absolutely nothing within the&nbsp;covers of Rabelais’s works incompatible with an orthodoxy which&nbsp;would be recognized as sufficient by Christendom at large, leaving&nbsp;out of the question those points of doctrine and practice on which&nbsp;Christians differ. Beyond this no wise man will go, and short&nbsp;of it hardly any unprejudiced man will stop.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The dates of the original editions of Rabelais’s works have been given where possible already. The earlier books were repeatedly&nbsp;reissued during the author’s life, and always with some correction.&nbsp;What may be called the first complete edition appeared in 1567 at&nbsp;Lyons, published by Jean Martin. It is computed that no less than&nbsp;sixty editions were printed before the close of the 16th century. A&nbsp;very considerable time, however, elapsed before the works were,&nbsp;properly speaking, edited. Huet devoted much pains to them, but&nbsp;his results were not made public. The first edition which calls for&nbsp;notice, except in a complete bibliography, is that of Le Duchat&nbsp;(Amsterdam, 1711). Le Duchat w׳as a very careful student, and&nbsp;on the whole a very efficient editor, being perhaps, of the group&nbsp;of students of old French at the beginning of the 18th century,&nbsp;which included La Monnoye and others, the most sober, critical,&nbsp;and accomplished. But at that time the knowledge of the period&nbsp;was scarcely far enough advanced. The next important date in&nbsp;the bibliography of Rabelais is 1823, in which year appeared the&nbsp;most elaborate edition of his work yet published, that of Esmangart&nbsp;and Johanneau (9 vols.), including for the first time the “Songes&nbsp;Drolatiques,” a spurious but early and not uninteresting collection&nbsp;of grotesque figure-drawings illustrating </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pantagruel,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">and the second edition of M. de l’Aulnaye, containing a bad text&nbsp;but a useful glossary. From this time the editions have been very&nbsp;numerous. Among them may be mentioned those illustrated by&nbsp;Gustave Doré, first on a small scale (1854), afterwards more elaborately (1870) ; that of the Collection Didot by Burgaud des Marets&nbsp;and Rathery (1859, second edition 1870) ; the Bibliothèque Elzévir-ienne edition by MM. Lacour and A. de Montaiglon ; that of the&nbsp;Nouvelle Collection Jannet (seven small volumes, 1867-74), completed by M. Moland ; and lastly, the edition of M. Marty-Laveaux&nbsp;in the Collection Lemerre (1868-81), which is unfortunately not&nbsp;yet completed, but which when finished will undoubtedly be the&nbsp;handsomest, the most accurate, and the most complete in the&nbsp;scholarly sense yet published. At present the most really useful&nbsp;edition which combines a handsome form with cheapness is that&nbsp;of the Nouvelle Collection Jannet, though that of AIM. Burgaud&nbsp;des Alarets and Rathery is not to be despised. Commentaries on&nbsp;Rabelais, independent of editions, have been especially numerous&nbsp;of late years ; the work of MM. Reville, Noel, Alayrargues, and&nbsp;Gebhart may be mentioned. But the best recent book on the subject in French is that of M. J. Fleury (2 vols., Paris, 1876), which,&nbsp;though deficient in exactitude as to many points of detail, and&nbsp;sacrificing something to a desire of presenting Rabelais as a great&nbsp;social philosopher, is, on the whole, veiy sensible and complete.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Rabelais was very early popular in England. There are possible allusions to him in Shakespeare, and the current clerical notion of&nbsp;him is very unjustly adopted by Marston in the words “wicked&nbsp;Rabelais”; but Bacon described him better as the great jester of&nbsp;France, and a Scot, Sir Thomas Urquhart, translated the earlier&nbsp;books in 1653. This was not worthily completed till the luckless&nbsp;Motteux, or, as his compatriots call him, Le Alotteux, finished it&nbsp;with an extensive commentary. Criticism of a scattered kind on&nbsp;Rabelais in English is abundant, that of Coleridge being the most&nbsp;important, while the constant evidence of his influence in Southey’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Doctor</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> is also noteworthy. But he was hardly treated as a whole&nbsp;before Air Besant’s book on the subject in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Foreign Classics for&nbsp;English Readers</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1879), which the author has since followed up&nbsp;with </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Readings from Rabelais</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (1883). Air Besant has too readily&nbsp;adopted (probably from Alichelet) the apocryphal scandals as to&nbsp;the difference between Rabelais and the poets of the Pléiade, and&nbsp;is committed (it is not quite clear why) to a view of Rabelais as a&nbsp;non-Christian thinker and preacher for which it is impossible to&nbsp;discover solid justification. But otherwise his books form the&nbsp;best introduction possible for a modern English reader to this&nbsp;great author.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G. SA. )</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RABENER, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Gottlieb Wilhelm </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1714-1771), German satirist, was born in 1714 near Leipsic, and after studying&nbsp;law at that city entered the civil service, in which he&nbsp;continued for many years. He died on 22d March 1771.&nbsp;The papers which he published in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bremer Beitràge&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">were subsequently collected into a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sammlung satirischer&nbsp;Schriflen</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (2 vols., 1751), to which two volumes were afterwards added. The work passed through numerous editions. Rabener’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Freundschaftliche Briefe</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> were published&nbsp;posthumously by C. F. Weisse with a biography. (See&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Germany, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">vol. x. p. 533.)</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">was a “dirty old blackguard” who liked filth and wallowed in it from choice, that hardly needs comment. His errors in this way&nbsp;are of course, looked at from an absolute standard, unpardonable.&nbsp;But judged relatively there are several, we shall not say excuses,&nbsp;but explanations of them. In the first place, the comparative&nbsp;indecency of Rabelais has been much exaggerated by persons unfamiliar with early French literature. The form of his book was&nbsp;above all tilings popular, and the popular French literature of the&nbsp;Middle Ages as distinguished from the courtly and literary literature, which was singularly pure, can hardly be exceeded in point&nbsp;of coarseness. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">fabliaux,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> the early burlesque romances of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Audigicr</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> class, the farces of the 15th century, equal (the grotesque&nbsp;iteration and amplification which is the note of </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Gargantua</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Pantagruel</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> being allowed for, and sometimes without that allowance) the coarsest passages of Rabelais. His coarseness, moreover,&nbsp;disgusting as it is, has nothing of the corruption of refined voluptuousness about it, and nothing of the sniggering indecency which&nbsp;disgraces men like Pope, like Voltaire, and like Sterne. It shows&nbsp;in its author a want of reverence, a want of decency in the proper&nbsp;sense, a too great readiness to condescend to the easiest kind of&nbsp;ludicrous ideas and the kind most acceptable at that time to the&nbsp;common run of mankind. The general taste having been considerably refined since, Rabelais has in parts become nearly unreadable,&nbsp;—the worst and most appropriate punishment for his faults. As&nbsp;for those who have tried to make his indecency an argument for&nbsp;his laxity in religious principle, that argument, like another mentioned previously, hardly needs discussion. It is notoriously false&nbsp;as a matter of experience. Rabelais could not have written as he&nbsp;has written in this respect and in others if he had been an earnestly&nbsp;pious person, taking heed to every act and word, and studious&nbsp;equally not to offend and not to cause offence. But no one in his&nbsp;senses would dream of claiming any such character for him.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">This brings us to the last point—what his religious opinions were. He has been claimed as a freethinker of all shades, from&nbsp;undogmatic theism to atheism, and as a concealed Protestant. The&nbsp;last of these claims has now been very generally given up, and&nbsp;indeed Erasmus might quite as reasonably be claimed for the&nbsp;Reformation as Rabelais. Both disliked and attacked the more&nbsp;crying abuses of their church, and both at the time and since have&nbsp;been disliked and attacked by the more imprudent partisans of&nbsp;that church. But Rabelais, in his own way, held off from the&nbsp;Reformation even more distinctly than Erasmus did. The accusation of freethinking, if not of directly anti-Christian thinking, has&nbsp;always been more common and has recently found much favour.&nbsp;It is, however, remarkable that those who hold this opinion never&nbsp;give chapter and verse for it, and it may be said confidently that&nbsp;chapter and verse cannot be given. The sayings attributed to&nbsp;Rabelais which colour the idea (such as the famous “Je vais&nbsp;chercher un grand peut-être,” said to have been uttered on his&nbsp;death-bed) are, as has been said, purely apocryphal. In the book&nbsp;itself nothing of the kind is to be found. Perhaps the nearest&nbsp;approach to it is a jest at the Sorbonne couched in the Pauline&nbsp;phrase about “ the evidence of things not seen,” which the author&nbsp;removed from the later editions. But irreverences of this kind,&nbsp;as well as the frequent burlesque citations of the Bible, whether&nbsp;commendable or not, had been, were, have since been, and are&nbsp;common in writers whose orthodoxy is unquestioned ; and it must&nbsp;be remembered that the later Middle Age, which in many respects&nbsp;Rabelais represents almost more than he does the Renaissance, was,&nbsp;with all its unquestioning faith, singularly reckless and, to our&nbsp;fancy, irreverent in its use of the sacred words and images, which&nbsp;were to it the most familiar of all images and words. On the other&nbsp;hand, there are in the book, in the description of Gargantua’s and&nbsp;Pantagruel’s education, in the sketch of the abbey of Thelema, in&nbsp;several passages relating to Pantagruel, expressions which either&nbsp;signify a sincere and unfeigned piety of a simple kind or else are&nbsp;inventions of the most detestable hypocrisy. For these passages&nbsp;are not, like many to be found from the Renaissance to the end&nbsp;of the 18th century, obvious flags of truce to cover attacks,—mere&nbsp;bowings in the house of Rimmon to prevent evil consequences.&nbsp;There is absolutely no sign of the tongue in the cheek. They are&nbsp;always written in the author’s highest style, a style perfectly eloquent and unaffected ; they can only be interpreted (on the free-thinking hypothesis) as allegorical with the greatest difficulty and&nbsp;obscurity, and it is pretty certain that no one reading the book&nbsp;without a thesis to prove would dream of taking them in a nonnatural sense. It is not, indeed, to be contended that Rabelais&nbsp;was a man with whom religion was in detail a constant thought,&nbsp;that he had a very tender conscience or a very scrupulous orthodoxy.&nbsp;His form of religious sentiment was not evangelical or mystical,&nbsp;any more than it was ascetic or ceremonial or dogmatic. As regards&nbsp;one of the accepted doctrines of his own church, the excellence of&nbsp;the celibate life, of poverty, and of elaborate obedience to a rule,&nbsp;he no doubt was a strong dissident ; but the evidence that, as a&nbsp;Christian, he was unorthodox, that he was even an heretical or&nbsp;latitudinarian thinker in regard to those doctrines which the various&nbsp;Christian churches have in common, is not merely weak, it is</span></p>
