Sτ, a considerable and strongly fortified city of Spain, the capital of the province of Guipuscoa. It is built on a tongue of land projecting into the sea. The north point of the mountain Orgullo, being the high land of St Sebastian, is about three miles to the west of Port Passage, on which is built the castle of Mota, which serves as a guide on one side, as the light-house does on the other entrance to the bay, which is a very narrow strait, not admitting through it more than two vessels at a time ; but the bay, when entered, is secure for vessels furnished with good ground-tackle, which sunken rocks make very necessary.</p><p>For the protection of vessels trading with the town, there</p><p>are piers, within which ships of 300 tons may enter at low water ; but when the tide is out they lie dry on a hard bottom.</p><p>The city is defended by strong works on the land side, and has only two gates. St Sebastian is better built than most Spanish towns, the streets being wide, straight, and well paved. The houses, also, are large and well built. The town contains, besides warehouses, about 700 houses, three parish churches, five monasteries, a hospital, and about 12,000 or 13,000 inhabitants. The plaza, or square, is a very fine object.</p><p>This place was the seat of the Guipuscoa Society, one of the largest trading associations in Spain, which formed a junction with the Manilla Company ; and these had almost a monopoly of the trade with Caraccas in the western colonies of Spain, and with the Philippine Islands in the East Indies. It was then a port of vast commercial importance, having, besides those branches, a considerable share <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the export trade of wool. At that period there were large establishments for making ropes and cables, many anchor- smiths and nail-smiths, and such other occupations as are connected with the equipment of ships ; but political circumstances have changed and much diminished the commerce of this place.</p><p>The important position of this place has drawn upon it much of the calamity of war. In former times it had been frequently besieged and occupied by opposing parties. It was treacherously seized by the French in 1808, and was occupied by them till 1813. When the battle of Vittoria had been gained by the Duke of Wellington on the 21st of June, a way was opened for the British army to attack this city, into which the French had thrown a powerful garrison, who defended it with great bravery and skill. The British army invested the place, and attempted to storm it on the 25th July ; but having been repulsed, they besieged it in regιdar form, and with the loss of many lives it was stormed and carried on the 31st of August. During the assault the town was set on fire and nearly destroyed ; and a scene of misery was exhibited to the unfortunate people, in the rage of the storming soldiery, as well as in the progress of the flames, which will long be recollected with horror by the wτetched sufferers. The city was, however, speedily rebuilt, and commerce gradually returned. The civil war in some measure centred here, it being the chief point by which the queen’s party received their supply of warlike stores from England. Its trade has, however, received a most disastrous check. The castle of Mota is in lat. 43. 19. N., and long. 1. 59. W.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
