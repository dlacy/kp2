This artist, only a namesake of the preceding, had similar aim and career. He first was a student, and subsequently became a professor in the academy of Düsseldorf. In 1854 he was made director of the art school at Carlsruhe, where in 1863 he died. He travelled and sketched in Italy, and aimed at historic landscape after the manner of the Poussins. His Biblical landscapes with figures are held in good esteem.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
