<p><span class="font1">RUTILIUS RUFUS, PUBLIUS, Roman statesman, orator and historian, born </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font1"> 158 b.c. He was on intimate terms with&nbsp;the younger Scipio, under whom he served in the Numantine&nbsp;War (134), and he also accompanied Q. Metellus Numidicus in&nbsp;the campaign against Jugurtha (109). In 105 he was elected&nbsp;to the consulship, and restored the discipline of the army&nbsp;and introduced an improved system of drill. Subsequently, he&nbsp;went as legate to Q. Mucius Scaevola, governor of Asia. By&nbsp;assisting his superior in his efforts to protect the provincials&nbsp;from the extortions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">publicani, qt</span><span class="font1"> farmers of taxes, Rufus&nbsp;incurred the hatred of the equestrian order, to which the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">publicani</span><span class="font1"> belonged. In 92 he was charged with the very offence&nbsp;of extortion which he had done his utmost to prevent. The&nbsp;charge was absurd, but as the juries at that time were chosen&nbsp;from the equites, his condemnation was only to be expected.&nbsp;Rufus accepted the verdict with the resignation befitting a&nbsp;Stoic and pupil of Panaetius. He retired to Mytilene, and&nbsp;afterwards to Smyrna, where he spent the rest of his life, and&nbsp;where Cicero saw him as late as the year 78. Although invited&nbsp;by Sulla to return to Rome, Rufus refused to do so. It was&nbsp;doubtless during his stay at Smyrna that he wrote his autobiography and a history of Rome in Greek, part of which is&nbsp;known to have been devoted to the Numantine War. He&nbsp;possessed a thorough knowledge of law, and wrote treatises on&nbsp;that subject, some fragments of which are quoted in the Digests.&nbsp;He was also well acquainted with Greek literature.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RUTLAND, EARLS AND DUKES OF. The 1st earl of Rutland was Edward Plantagenet (1373-1415), son of Edmund,&nbsp;duke of York, and grandson of King Edward III. In 1390 he was&nbsp;created earl of Rutland, but was to hold the title only during&nbsp;the lifetime of his father, on whose death in 1402 the earldom&nbsp;accordingly became extinct, the earl then becoming duke&nbsp;of York. The title earl of Rutland seems to have been assumed&nbsp;subsequently by different members of the house of York,&nbsp;though it does not appear that any of them had a legal right&nbsp;to it. One of these was the 1st earl’s nephew, Richard Plantagenet, duke of York, father of King Edward IV. Richard’s&nbsp;daughter Anne married for her second husband Sir Thomas&nbsp;St Leger, and their daughter Anne married George Manners,&nbsp;12th Baron Ros, or Roos (d. 1513). Their son, Thomas Manners&nbsp;(d. 1543), was therefore great-grandson of Richard Plantagenet,&nbsp;who had styled himself earl of Rutland among other titles. In&nbsp;1525 Thomas Manners was created earl of Rutland, and his&nbsp;descendants have held this title to the present day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Thomas was a favourite of Henry VIII., who conferred on him many offices and extensive grants of land, including Belvoir&nbsp;Castle, in Leicestershire, which became henceforth the chief residence of his family. He was succeeded in the earldom by his&nbsp;son Henry </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font1"> 1516-1563); and his second son, Sir John&nbsp;Manners, acquired Haddon Hall, Derbyshire, by his marriage&nbsp;with Dorothy, daughter of Sir George Vernon, called “ the king&nbsp;of the Peak.” Henry, the 2nd earl, was an admiral of the fleet&nbsp;in the reign of Queen Mary, and later enjoyed the favour of Queen&nbsp;Elizabeth. His son Edward, 3rd earl </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font1"> 1548-1587), who was&nbsp;also a favourite with Elizabeth, left no sons, and the barony of&nbsp;Ros, which had hitherto descended with the earldom, passed&nbsp;to his daughter Elizabeth (d. 1591), wife of William Cecil, earl&nbsp;of Exeter; his successor in the earldom was his brother John&nbsp;(d. 1588), whose son Roger, 5th earl (1576-1612), married a&nbsp;daughter of Sir Philip Sidney. The barony of Ros was restored&nbsp;to the main line of the family in the person of Francis, 6th earl&nbsp;(1578-1632), who inherited it in 1618 as heir general of his cousin&nbsp;William Cecil, Lord Ros (1590-1618); but it was again separated&nbsp;from the earldom of Rutland on the death of Francis without&nbsp;male issue, and the assumption of the courtesy title of Lord&nbsp;Ros by the eldest son of subsequent earls of Rutland appears&nbsp;co have had no legal basis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The 8th earl, a cousin of his predecessor and also of the 6th earl, was John (1604-1679), eldest son of Sir George Manners&nbsp;(d. 1623) of Haddon, a descendant of Sir John Manners, the&nbsp;second son of the 1st earl. His son John, 9th earl (1638-1711),&nbsp;a partisan of the revolution of 1688, received the Princess Anne&nbsp;at Belvoir Castle on her flight from London; after the accession&nbsp;of Anne to the throne she created him marquess of Granby&nbsp;and duke of Rutland in 1703. The 1st duke was three times&nbsp;married; the divorce in 1670, while he was still known as Lord&nbsp;Ros, of His first wife, Anne, daughter of the marquess of Dorchester, was a very celebrated legal case, being the first instance&nbsp;of divorce </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a vinculo</span><span class="font1"> by act of parliament, a divorce </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a mensa et&nbsp;thoro</span><span class="font1"> having previously been granted by the ecclesiastical courts.&nbsp;His grandson John, the 3rd duke (1696-1779), was the father&nbsp;of John Manners, marquess of Granby </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> a distinguished&nbsp;soldier, whose son Charles, 4th duke of Rutland (1754-1787),&nbsp;succeeded his grandfather. When marquess of Granby he&nbsp;represented Cambridge University in the House of Commons,&nbsp;and hotly opposed the policy that led to war with the American&nbsp;colonies. He was instrumental in procuring the entrance of the&nbsp;younger Pitt to the House of Commons, and remained through&nbsp;life an intimate friend of that statesman. After succeeding&nbsp;to the dukedom in 1779, he sat in the cabinets of Shelburne&nbsp;and of Pitt, and became lord lieutenant of Ireland in 1784.&nbsp;He was one of the earliest to advocate a legislative union&nbsp;between Ireland and Great Britain, which he recommended in&nbsp;a letter to Pitt in June 1784. The poet Crabbe was for some&nbsp;time private chaplain to the duke at Belvoir. His wife, Mary&nbsp;Isabella (1756-1831), “the beautiful duchess,’’ whose portrait&nbsp;was four times painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, was a daughter&nbsp;of the 4th duke of Beaufort. His eldest son, John Henry, 5th&nbsp;duke (1778-1857), was “ the duke ” in Disraeli’s Cowfwgidy; the&nbsp;latter’s two sons, the marquess of Granby and Lord John Manners,&nbsp;figuring in the same novel as “ the marquis of Beaumanoir ”&nbsp;and “ Lord Henry Sidney ” respectively. Both these sons&nbsp;succeeded in turn to the dukedom, Lord John Manners succeeding his brother Charles Cecil John, the 6th duke (1815-1888), as&nbsp;7th duke of Rutland (see below) in 1888. In 1891 he was made&nbsp;a knight of the Garter, being the tenth earl and the sixth duke&nbsp;of Rutland of the same creation to wear this illustrious order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUTLAND, JOHN JAMES ROBERT MANNERS, </span><span class="font2">7TI1DUKE or </span><span class="font1">(1818-1906), English statesman, was bom at Belvoir Castle on&nbsp;the 13th of December 1818, being the younger son of the 5th&nbsp;duke of Rutland by Lady Elizabeth Howard, daughter of&nbsp;Byron’s guardian, the 5th earl of Carlisle. Lord John Manners;&nbsp;as he then was, was educated at Eton and Trinity College,&nbsp;Cambridge. In 1841 he was returned for Newark in the Tory&nbsp;interest, along with W. E. Gladstone, and sat for that borough&nbsp;until 1847. Subsequently he sat for Colchester, 1850-57; for&nbsp;North Leicestershire, 1857-85; and for East Leicestershire&nbsp;from 1885 until in 1888 he took his seat in the House of Lords&nbsp;upon succeeding to the dukedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Melbourne’s Whig government had been doomed for some time before it went out in June 1841. The Tories came in with&nbsp;a large majority under Peel, and among Manners’s friends who&nbsp;were successful in the constituencies, besides Gladstone, were&nbsp;Smythe, afterwards 7th Viscount Strangford, at Canterbury;&nbsp;Baillie-Cochrane, afterwards 1st Lord Lamington, at Bridport;&nbsp;and Disraeli at Shrewsbury. Cherishing many of the ideas&nbsp;of the cavaliers of the 17 th century, and full of political and&nbsp;literary ardour, Lord John was soon prominent in the social&nbsp;group which revolved round Lady Blessington.. In 1841 he&nbsp;committed some of his loyalist and other fancies to a volume&nbsp;called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">England's Trust, and other Poems,</span><span class="font1"> which he dedicated to&nbsp;his friend Smythe, and in which occurred the familiar line about&nbsp;“ laws and learning ” and “ our old nobility.” Before the&nbsp;end of this year Manners had definitely associated himself&nbsp;with the “ Young England ” party, under the leadership of&nbsp;Disraeli. This party sought to extinguish the predominance&nbsp;of the middle-class </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bourgeoisie,</span><span class="font1"> and to re-create the political&nbsp;prestige of the aristocracy by resolutely proving its capacity&nbsp;to ameliorate the social, intellectual, and material condition of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
