<p><span class="font0">predecessor, and the recently erected palace, which had a marble staircase and a fine garden, the houses were of wood. The&nbsp;dress of the men was thoroughly Turkish except for their lambskin caps, that of the women half Greek, half Turkish. The&nbsp;houses were scrupulously clean and strewn with sw’eet herbs.&nbsp;Del Chiaro notices the great imitative capacity of the race, both&nbsp;artistic and mechanical. A Walachian in Venice had copied&nbsp;several of the pictures there with great skill; the copper-plates&nbsp;and wood engravings for the new press were executed by native&nbsp;hands. The Walachians imitated every kind of Turkish and&nbsp;European manufacture; and, though the boiars imported finer&nbsp;glass from Venice and Bohemia, a glass manufactory had been&nbsp;established near Tirgovishtea which produced a better quality&nbsp;than the Polish. From the Bucharest press, besides a variety&nbsp;of ecclesiastical books, there were issued in the Ruman tongue&nbsp;a translation of a French work entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Maxims of the&nbsp;Orientals</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Romance of Alexander the Great,</span><span class="font0"> In 1700&nbsp;Brancovan had a map of the country made and a copperplate&nbsp;engraving of it executed at Padua.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prosperity of Walachia, however, under its “ Golden Bey/’ as Brancovan was known at Stambul, only increased the&nbsp;Turkish exactions; and, although all demands were&nbsp;punctually met, the sultan finally resolved on the&nbsp;removal of his too prosperous vassal. Brancovan&nbsp;was accused of secret correspondence with the emperor, tjne&nbsp;tsar, the king of Poland and the Venetian republic, of betraying the Porte’s secrets, of preferring Tirgovishtea to Bucharest&nbsp;as a residence, of acquiring lands and palaces in Transylvania,&nbsp;of keeping agents at Venice and Vienna, in both of which cities&nbsp;he had invested large sums, and of striking gold coins with his&nbsp;effigy.@@<sup>1</sup> An envoy arrived at Bucharest on the 4th of April&nbsp;1714, and proclaimed Brancovan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">mazil, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> deposed. He&nbsp;was conducted to Constantinople and beheaded, together with&nbsp;his four sons. A scion of the rival Cantacuzenian family was&nbsp;elected by the pasha’s orders, and he, after exhausting the&nbsp;principality for the benefit of the Divan, was in turn deposed</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and executed in 1716.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this period onwards the Porte introduced a new system with regard to its Walachian vassals. The line of national&nbsp;princes ceased. The office of voivode or hospodar&nbsp;was sold to the highest bidder at Stambul, to be farmed&nbsp;out from a purely mercenary point of view. The&nbsp;princes who now succeeded one another in rapid succession were mostly Greeks from the Phanar quarter of Constantinople who had served the palace in the quality of&nbsp;dragoman (interpreter), or held some other court appointment.&nbsp;They were nominated by imperial firman without a shadow&nbsp;of free election, and were deposed and transferred from one&nbsp;principality to another, executed or reappointed, like so many&nbsp;pashas. Like pashas they rarely held their office more than&nbsp;three years, it being the natural policy of the Porte to multiply&nbsp;such lucrative nominations. The same hospodar was often&nbsp;reappointed again and again as he succeeded in raising the sum&nbsp;necessary to buy back his title. Constantine Mavrocordato&nbsp;was in this way hospodar of Walachia at six different times,&nbsp;and paid on one occasion as much as a million lion-dollars&nbsp;(£40,000) for the office. The princes thus imposed on the&nbsp;country were generally men of intelligence and culture. Nicholas&nbsp;Mavrocordato, the first of the series, was himself the author&nbsp;of a Greek work on duties, and maintained at his court Demeter&nbsp;Prokopios of Moschopolis in Macedonia, who wrote a review&nbsp;of Greek literature during the 17th and beginning ofthei8th&nbsp;centuries. Constantine Mavrocordato was the author of really&nbsp;liberal reforms. He introduced an </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nrbarium</span><span class="font0"> or land law,&nbsp;limiting to 24 the days of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">angaria,</span><span class="font0"> or forced labour, owed&nbsp;yearly by the peasants to their feudal lord. In 1747 he decreed&nbsp;the abolition of serfdom, but this enactment was not carried</span></p>
<p><span class="font0"><sup>@@@1 </sup>One of these, with the legend “ constantinvs bassaraba de BRANCOVAN D.G.VOEVODA ET PRINCEPS VALACHIAE TRANSALPINAE,”&nbsp;and having on the reverse the crowned shield of Walachia containing&nbsp;a raven holding a cross in its beak between a moon and a star, is&nbsp;engraved by Del Chiaro. They were of 2, 3 and 10 ducats weight.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">into effect. But the rule of the Phanariotes could not but be productive of grinding oppression, and it was rendered doubly&nbsp;hateful by the swarms of Greek adventurers who accompanied&nbsp;them. Numbers of the peasantry emigrated, and the population&nbsp;rapidly diminished. In 1745 the number of tax-paying families,&nbsp;which a few years before had amounted to 147,000, had sunk&nbsp;to 70,000. Yet the taxes were continually on the increase,&nbsp;and the hospodar Scarlat Ghica (1758-61), though he tried to&nbsp;win some popularity by the removal of Turkish settlers and the&nbsp;abolition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vakarit</span><span class="font0"> or tax on cattle and horses, which was&nbsp;peculiarly hateful to the peasantry, raised the total amount&nbsp;of taxation to 25,000,000 lion-dollars, about £1,000,000. The&nbsp;Turks meantime maintained their grip on the country by holding on the Walachian bank of the Danube the fortresses of&nbsp;Giurgevo, Turnu Severin and Orsova, with the surrounding&nbsp;districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the tide of Ottoman dominion was ebbing fast. Already, by the peace of Passarowitz Pozharevats in 1718, the banat&nbsp;of Craiova had been ceded to the emperor, though by the peace&nbsp;of Belgrade in 1739 it was recovered by the Porte for its Walachian vassal. In 1769 the Russian general Romanzov occupied&nbsp;the principality, the bishops and clergy took an oath of fidelity&nbsp;to the empress Catherine, and a deputation of boiars followed.&nbsp;The liberties of the country were guaranteed, taxation reformed&nbsp;and in 1772 the negotiations at Fokshani between Russia and&nbsp;the Porte broke down because the empress’s representatives&nbsp;insisted on the sultan’s recognition of the independence of&nbsp;Walachia and Moldavia under a European guarantee.. Turkish&nbsp;rule was, however, definitely restored by the treaty of Kutchuk&nbsp;Kainardji, in 1774; and as from this period onwards Walachian&nbsp;history is closely connected with that of Moldavia, it may be&nbsp;convenient before continuing this review to turn to the earlier&nbsp;history of the sister principality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moldavia.—</span><span class="font0">According to the native traditional account,&nbsp;as first given by the Moldavian chroniclers of the 16th, 17th&nbsp;and 18th centuries, Dragosh the son of Bogdan, the founder of&nbsp;the Moldavian principality, emigrated with his followers from&nbsp;the Hungarian district of Marmaros in the northern Carpathians.&nbsp;The dates assigned, to this event vary from 1299, given by&nbsp;Urechia, to 1342, given by the monastic chronicle of Putna.&nbsp;The story is related with various fabulous accompaniments.&nbsp;From the aurochs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(zimbru),</span><span class="font0"> in pursuit of which Dragosh first&nbsp;arrived on the banks of the Moldova, is derived the ox-head of&nbsp;the Moldavian national arms, and from his favourite hound&nbsp;who perished in the waters the name of the river. From the&nbsp;Hungarian and Russian sources, which are somewhat more&nbsp;precise, the date of the arrival of Dragosh, who is confused&nbsp;with the historical Bogdan Voda (1349-1365), appears to have&nbsp;been 1340, and his departure from Marmaros was carried out&nbsp;in defiance of his Hungarian suzerain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">These legendary accounts seem to show that the Moldavian voivodate was founded, like that of Walachia, by Vlach immigrants from Hungary, during the first half of the&nbsp;14th century. Its original strength lay probably in&nbsp;the compact Ruman settlements among the eastern&nbsp;Carpathians, first mentioned by Nicetas of Chonae, about 1164.&nbsp;The Moldavian lowlands were still held by a variety of Tatar&nbsp;tribes, who were only expelled after 135c, by the united efforts&nbsp;of Andrew Laszkovich, voivode of Transylvania, and Bogdan&nbsp;Voda, the first independent prince of Moldavia. Coins bearing&nbsp;the name of Bogdan are still extant; and there is an inscription&nbsp;over his tomb at the monastery of Radautzi, in Bukovina,&nbsp;placed there by Stephen the Great of Moldavia (1457-1504).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In-.the agreement arrived at betw een Louis of Hungary and the emperor Charles IV. in 1372, the voivodate of Moldavia w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;recognized as a dependency of the crown of St Stephen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The overlordship<sup>v</sup>over the country was, however, contested by the king of Poland, and their rival&nbsp;claims were .a continual source of dispute between the&nbsp;two kingdoms. In 1412 a remarkable agreement w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;arrived at between Sigismund, in his quality of king of&nbsp;Hungary, and King Ladislaus II. of Poland, by which both parties</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
