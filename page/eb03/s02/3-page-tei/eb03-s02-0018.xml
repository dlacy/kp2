No doubt, it added to the gloom of his mind; and he now ſaw his court abandoned by almoſt all his nobility.</p><p>At laſt James was in ſome degree rouſed from his inaction, by the preparations made againſt him by his uncle Henry VIII. of England. Some differences had already taken place; to accommodate which, Henry had deſired a conference with James at York. But this the latter, by the advice of his parliament, had declined. The conſequetice was a rupture between the two courts, and the Engliſh had taken 20 of the Scots trading veſſels. Henry threatened to revive the antiquated claim of the Engliſh ſuperiority over Scotland, and had given orders for a formidable invaſion of the Scotch borders. He complained that James had uſurped his title of Defender of the Faith, to which he had added the word Chriſtian, implying that Henry was an infidel: but the kings of Scotland had, ſome time before, been complimented by the papal ſee with that title. James, on the other hand, threw his eyes towards Ireland, the north part oſ which was actually peopled with inhabitants who owned no ſovereign but the king of Scotland, and who offered to ſerve James againſt the Engliſh; ſome of their chiefs having actually repaired to Scotland, and done homage to James. Henry had, about this time, declared himſelf king of Ireland, of which he was before only ſtyled the <hi rend="italic">lord; </hi>and James roundly aſſerted, that he had a preferable claim to at leaſt one half of that iſland, which had been peopled by the ſubjects of Scotland. Though the Scotch hiſtorians of this reign take very little notice of this incident, yet James appears to have been very tenacious of his title; and that there was a vaſt intercourſe carried on between the ſubjects of Scotland and the northern Iriſh, who unanimouſly acknowledged James for their natural ſovereign. Indeed, this was the only ground of quarrel that the king, with the leaſt ſhadow of juſtice, could allege againſt Henry.</p><p>His parliament being met, many public-ſpirited acts were paſſed; and before the aſſembly was diſſolved, the members renewed the acts againſt leaſing-making; by which is meant the miſrepreſenting of the king to his nobles, or the nobles to their king: and James, to diſmiſs them in good humour, paſſed an act of free grace for all crimes committed in his minority; the earl of Angus, and Sir George and Sir Archibald Douglas, being excepted.</p><p>Henry, after cutting off the head of his wife Catharine Howard, married and divorced the princeſs Anne of Cleves, and found himſelf either deſerted or diſtruſted by all the princes on the continent, Proteſtant as well as Roman Catholic. James and his clergy relied greatly on this public odium incurred by Henry; but the emperor having again quarrelled with Francis, left Henry, whoſe dominions they had threatened jointly to invade, at liberty to continue his preparations againſt the Scots. He firſt ordered his fleet, then the moſt formidable of any in the world, to make freſh deſcents upon Scotland. At the ſame time, he appointed a very conſiderable army to rendezvous upon the borders, under the command of Sir Robert Bowes, one of his wardens, the earl of Angus, and his two brothers Sir George and Sir Archibald Douglas. James was every day expecting ſupplies of money, arms, and other neceſſarſes from Francis; but theſe not arriving, he reaſſembled his parliament on the 14th of March, which gratified him in all his demands. Many excellent regulations were made for the internal government, peace, and ſecurity of the kingdom, and againſt the exportation of money inſtead of merchandiſe. Acts were paſſed for fortifying and embelliſhing the town of Edinburgh, and for better ſupplying the ſubjects with wine and all the other neceſſaries of life. The royal revenue was increaſed by many additional eſtates; and the laſt hand was put to one of the beſt plans for a national militia that perhaps ever appeared. As yet, excepting in the diſappointment which Henry met with from his nephew in not meeting him at York, he had no grounds for commencing hoſtilities. But it is here proper to obſerve, that the queen mother was then dead; and conſequently the connection between James and Henry was weakened. Whatever her private character might have been, ſhe was certainly a happy instrument of preventing bloodſhed between the two kingdoms. She was buried with royal honours at Perth.</p><p>James, to all appearance, was at this time in a moſt deſirable ſituation. His domain, by forfeitures and otherwiſe, far exceeded that of any of his predeceſſors. He could command the purſes of his clergy; he had large films of ready money in his exchequer; his forts were well ſtored and fortified; and he was now daily receiving remittances of money, arms, and ammunition from France. All this ſhow of happineſs was only in appearance; for the affections of his nobility, and the wiſer part of his ſubjects, were now alienated from him more than ever, by the exceſſive attachment he ſhowed to bigotry and persecution.</p><p>He had nominated the earl of Huntley to command his army on the borders, conſiſting of 10,000 men; and his lieutenant-general was Sir Walter Lindſay of Torphichen, who had ſeen a great deal of foreign ſervice, and was eſteemed an excellent officer. Huntley acquitted himſelf admirably well in his commiſſion; and was ſo well ſerved by his ſpies, as to have certain intelligence that the Engliſh intended to ſurpriſe and burn Jedburgh and Kelſo. The Engliſh army under Sir Robert Bowes and the Douglaſſes, with other northern Engliſhmen, continued ſtill upon the borders; and one of the reſolutions the Scotch nobility and gentry had come to, was, not to attack them on their own ground, nor to act offenſively, unleſs their enemies invaded Scotland. Huntly being informed that the Engliſh had advanced, on the 24th of Auguſt, to a place called <hi rend="italic">Haldanrig,</hi> and that they had deſtroyed great part of the Scotch and debateable lands, reſolved to engage them: and the Engliſh were aſtoniſhed, when at day-break they ſaw the Scotch army drawn up in order of battle. Neither party could now retreat without fighting; and Torphichen, who led the van, conſiſting of 2000 of the beſt troops of Scotland, charged the Engliſh ſo furiouſly, that Huntley gained a complete and an eaſy victory. Above 200 of the Engliſh were killed, and 600 taken priſoners; among whom were their general Sir Robert Bowes, Sir William Mowbray, and about 60 of the moſt diſtinguiſhed northern barons; the earl of Angus eſcaping by the ſwiftneſs of his horſe. The loſs of the Scots was inconſiderable.</p><p>In the meanwhile, the duke, of Norfolk having rai-</p></body></text></TEI>
