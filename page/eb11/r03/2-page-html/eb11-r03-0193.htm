<p><span class="font0">appointed by the Edinburgh town council sole regent of the “town’s college” (“Academia Jacobi Sexti,” afterwards the&nbsp;university of Edinburgh), and three years later he received&nbsp;from the same source the title of “ principal, or first master,”&nbsp;and was engaged in lecturing on philosophy. When the staff&nbsp;of the young college was increased by the appointment of&nbsp;additional regents, he assumed with consent of the presbytery&nbsp;the office of professor of theology. From 1587 he also preached&nbsp;regularly in the East Kirk every Sunday at 7 a.m., and in 1596&nbsp;he accepted one of the eight ministerial charges of the city.&nbsp;He took a prominent part in the somewhat troubled church&nbsp;politics of the day, and distinguished himself by gentleness&nbsp;and tact, as well as ability. He was appointed on several&nbsp;occasions to committees of presbytery and assembly on pressing&nbsp;ecclesiastical business. He was elected moderator of the&nbsp;General Assembly held at Dundee in May 1597. In 1598 he&nbsp;was translated to the parish church of the Upper Tolbooth,&nbsp;Edinburgh, and immediately thereafter to that of the Grey&nbsp;Friars (then known as the Magdalen Church). He died at&nbsp;Edinburgh on the 8th of February 1599.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROMAN ARMY. In the long life of the ancient Roman ar,my, the most effective and long-lived military institution known to&nbsp;history, we may distinguish four principal stages. (1) In the&nbsp;earliest age of Rome the army was a national or citizen levy such&nbsp;as we find in the beginnings of all states. (2) This grew into the&nbsp;Republican army of conquest, which gradually subdued Italy&nbsp;and the Mediterranean world. A citizen army of infantry,&nbsp;varying in size with the needs of each year, it eventually&nbsp;developed into a mercenary force with long service and professional organization. This became (3) the Imperial army of&nbsp;defence, which developed from a strictly citizen army into one&nbsp;which represented the provinces as well as Italy, and was&nbsp;a garrison rather than a field army. Lastly, (4) the assaults&nbsp;of the Barbarian horsemen compelled both the creation of a&nbsp;field force distinct from the frontier garrisons and the inclusion&nbsp;of a large mounted clement, which soon counted for much more&nbsp;than the infantry. The Roman army had been one of foot&nbsp;soldiers; in its latest phase it was marked by that predominance&nbsp;of the horseman which characterized the earlier centuries of&nbsp;the middle ages.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">So far as we can follow this long development in its details, it was throughout continuous. So unbroken, indeed, is the&nbsp;growth that many of the military technical terms survived in&nbsp;use from epoch to epoch, unchanged in form though deeply&nbsp;modified in meaning, and ordinary readers often miss the&nbsp;diversity which underlies this unchanged-seeming system.&nbsp;The term </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legio,</span><span class="font0"> for example, occurs in all the four stages above&nbsp;outlined. But in each its significance varies. Throughout, it&nbsp;denoted citizen-soldiers: throughout, it denoted also a force&nbsp;which was chiefly, if not wholly, heavy infantry. But the&nbsp;setting of these two constant features varies from age to age.&nbsp;In the first period </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legio</span><span class="font0"> was the “ levy,” the whole host summoned to take the field. In the second period it was not the&nbsp;whole levy, but one of the principal units into which developing&nbsp;organization had divided that levy; the “ legion ” was now&nbsp;a body of some 5000 men—the number of “ legions ” varied&nbsp;with the circumstances, and the army included other troops&nbsp;besides citizens, though they were for the most part unimportant. In the third or Imperial age there were many legions&nbsp;(indeed, a fixed number) quartered in fixed fortresses; there&nbsp;were also other troops, numerous and important, if not yet&nbsp;so formidable as the legionaries. Finally, the legions became&nbsp;smaller units, and the other troops of the army, notably the&nbsp;cavalry, became the real fighting-line of Rome (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Legion).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">First Stage.—</span><span class="font0">The history of the earliest Roman army is, as one might expect, both ill-recorded and contaminated with&nbsp;much legend and legal fiction. We read of a primitive force&nbsp;of 300 riders and 3000 foot soldiers, in which the horseman&nbsp;counted for almost everything. But the numbers are clearly&nbsp;artificial and invented, while the pre-eminence accorded to the&nbsp;cavalry has no sequel in later Roman history. We reach&nbsp;firmer ground with the organization ascribed to Servius Tullius.&nbsp;In this system the host included all citizens from 17 to 60 years&nbsp;of age, those under 47 for service in the field, those over 46 for&nbsp;garrison duty in Rome. The soldiers were grouped at first by&nbsp;their wealth—that is, their ability to provide their own horses,&nbsp;armour, &amp;c.—into cavalry (18 “ centuries ”), heavy infantry,&nbsp;a remainder which it would be polite to call light infantry,&nbsp;and some artificers. The heavy infantry counted for most.&nbsp;Armed with long spears and divided into the three orders of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hastati, principes</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">triarii</span><span class="font0"> (the origins and real senses of&nbsp;these names are lost), they formed a phalanx, and charged&nbsp;in a mass, while the cavalry protected the wings. The men&nbsp;were enrolled for a year—that is, for the summer campaign; in the autumn, like all primitive armies, they went&nbsp;home. It has been conjectured that about the time of the&nbsp;fall of the kings the normal Roman army comprised some&nbsp;8500 infantry under 47 years of age, 5000 seniors, 1000 riders&nbsp;and 500 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fabri,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. The evidence for the calculation is unfortunately inadequate, but the result is not altogether improbable, and it may help the reader to realize what “ may&nbsp;have been.” It must be added that this Servian system is&nbsp;closely connected with the political organization (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Rome,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Second Stage.—</span><span class="font0">From this Servian army a series of changes which we cannot trace in detail produced the Republican&nbsp;army of conquest. Our ancient authorities ascribe the chief&nbsp;reforms to the half-legendary Camillus </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> who introduced&nbsp;the beginnings of pay and long service, improved the armour&nbsp;and weapons, abolished the phalanx and substituted for it an&nbsp;open order based on small subdivisions (maniples), each containing two centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Whatever the truth about Camillus, some such reforms must at some time have been carried through, to convert the&nbsp;Servian system into the army which was engaged for nearly&nbsp;three centuries (from 350 </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font0"> in conquering Italy and the&nbsp;world. This army broke in succession the stout native soldiers&nbsp;of Italy and the mountaineers of Spain and overthrew the&nbsp;trained Macedonian phalanx. Once only did it fail—against&nbsp;Hannibal (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Punic Wars).</span><span class="font0"> But not even Hannibal could&nbsp;oust it from entrenchments, and not even his victories could&nbsp;permanently break its </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">moral.</span><span class="font0"> Much of its strength lay in the&nbsp;same qualities which made the Puritan soldiers of Cromwell&nbsp;terrible—the excellent character of the common soldiers, the&nbsp;rigid discipline, the high training. Credit, too, must be given&nbsp;to the genius of the Scipios and to the more commonplace&nbsp;capacities of many fairly able generals. But the organism</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
