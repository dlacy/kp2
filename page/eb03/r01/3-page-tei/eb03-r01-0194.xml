Two gentlemen were felected from his body guard, and, with all the parade of an execution, beheaded in the court of his palace. Their heads were ſtuck upon fpears, and led the proceſſion ; whilſt the royal captives who followed in the train, and beheld this fpectacle, were conducted fυ ſlowly, that a ſhort journey of twelve miles was protracted to fix hours. The king, the queen, and their children, were lodged in the old palace of the Louvre, while Monſieur went to reſide at the Luxemburg. The city was illumina-ted, and the evening fpent in triumph by the Pari-ſians.</p><p>The removal of the king to Paris was regarded as a triumph by the popular party. The higher order of nobles conſidered it as completely ruinous to their hopes ; and even many men of talents, ſuch as Mounier and Lally Tollendal, whom we cannot avoid regarding as friends to the popular cauſe in its out-ſet, now re-gardcd every profpect of attaining a happy conflit ution-al freedom as at an end, as the national reprefentatives muff be for ever expυfed to the inſults, and overawed by the influ&lt;gιce, of a turbulent capital. Many members of the affembly took refuge in foreign countries, and uſed every effort to excite the other nations of Europe to lioſtility againſt France. As the duke of odeans had been regarded as a chief agent in promoting the late diſturbances, the marquis de la Fayette waited upon him, and inſiſted upon his leaving the kingdom for a time. The duke was overawed, and, on pretence of public buſineſs, went to England, where he remained for ſeveral months.</p><p>Οη the i gth of october, the National Aſſembly held its firſt ſeſſion in Paris. The King was clofely guarded in his own palace ; and no apparent oppoſition now ſtood in the way to prevent the popular party from giving to their country ſuch a conſtitution as they might judge expedient. Much, however, was yet to be done, and many difficulties remained, reſulting from the habits of men educated under a very different order of things. Two days after the Affembly came to Paris, a baker was publicly.executed by the mob, upon a falſe accuſation of having concealed a quantity of bread.— while the Affembly was at a diſtance, events of this nature had been little attended to, and the leading party avoided attempting to check theſe ebullitions of popular violence, from which they had derived fo much advantage ; but that party was now all-powerful, and ſo flagrant an offence committed againſt the law was regarded as an inſnlt upon the ſovereignty of the National Affembly. Two leaders of the mob were therefore tried and publicly executed, and a ſevere law was paffed, of the nature of the Britiſh riot act, authoriſing the magiſtrates to act by military force againſt any multitude of perſons that ſhould refuſe to diſperſe. Thus the peace of the capital was ſecured for ſeveral months; but in the country at large no ſmall degree of anxiety and trouble ſtill ſubſiſted. The ſame ſufpicious temper which had prevailed at Paris agitated the provinces with the dread of plots and monopolies oſ grain. Add to this, that the nobleſſe in the country were by no means ſatisſied with the liberality with which their reprefentatives had on the 4th of Auguſt voted away their privileges and their property. This produced violent jealoufies between the peaſants and their lords,</p><p>and gradually conveyed to every corner of the kingdom the political ferment which had commenced at Paris.</p><p>The National Aſſembly being now, however, in to-lerable ſecurity, proceeded in the arduous attempt of forming a free conſtitution for the great empire of France. The Abbé Sieyes preſented a plan for dividing the kingdom into 83 <hi rend="italic">departments,</hi>  of about 324 fquare leagues, and of each department into feve-ral <hi rend="italic">difiricts,</hi>  and each diſtrict was ſubdivided into <hi rend="italic">cantons </hi>of four ſquare leagues in extent. Thus the whole of the ancient diviſions of the kingdom into governments, generalities, and bailiewicks, was in an inſtant obliterated. An attempt was alſo made to Amplify in an equal degree the relative ſituation of individuals in civil life, by a decree which put an end to all diſtinction of orders and immunities, ſo far as any privilege whatever was concerned. At the ſame time, a bold and moſt im-portant meaſure was adopted, which has lince proved the organ of thoſe terrible efforts which France has been enabled to make againſt the reft of Europe. This was the conſiſcation of the whole of the lands belonging to the church, for the purpoſe of ſupplying the exigencies of the ſtate. In this tranſaction, all regard to juſtice was thrown aſide. The lands of the church were as certainly the property of the then poſſeiſors of them as any entailed eſtate among us is the property of him who occupies it. The ſtate may have had a right to appropriate to itſelf the church lands upon the death of the incumbents ; but it might with equal juſtice, and perhaps greater propriety, have ſeized the enormous re-venues of the Duke of Qrleans, as have confifcated a ſingle acre belonging to the moſt ufelefs abbot without his own conſent. This nefarious meafure was pro--poſed by the biſhop of Autun, M. Tallegrand Peri-gord, a man of no religion, who had been promoted to the bench in a moſt irregular manner to ſerve this very purpoſe. The mode in which this property was to be expended was by iſſuing affiguments <hi rend="italic">(affignats)</hi>  upon it; which aſſignments were to be received by the ſtate for the payment of taxes, or for the purchaſe of church lands when ſet up to ſale. A proviſion was at the ſame time made for the national clergy, who were for the future to be paid by the ſtate. Qn the day following that on which this important meaſure was adopted, a decree was paffed, ſuſpending the parliaments of the kingdom from the exerciſe of their functions.</p><p>Decrees, in which the intereſts of ſo vaſt a multitude of individuals were involved, could not be carried into effect without much murmuring and oppoſition. Thc parliaments, in particular, began to exert themſelves with vigour, and, by proteſts and other publications, attempted to invalidate the decrees of the Aſſembly as illegal ; but theſe privileged bodies, who had often been accuſtomed to contend with fome ſuccefs againſt the deſpotic adminiſtration of their country, and 011 that account had been for ages the objects of public ap-plauſe, now found themfelves utterly forfaken, and unable to reſiſt the mandate of a popular Aſſembly. After a few fruitleſs ſtruggles, they were all of them under the neceſſity of ſubmitting to their fate.</p><p>Nothing remarkable now .occurred for ſome time.— The Aſſembly proceeded to organize the kingdom by the eſtabliſhment of municipalities, and by reforming the juriſprudence of thc country.
