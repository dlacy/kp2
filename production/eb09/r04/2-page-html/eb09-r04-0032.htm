<p><span class="font0">Sviatoslaff, slain by the Petchenegs ; Vladimir, who caused the country to be Christianized ; and Yaroslaff his son,&nbsp;the legislator. During the second period, in which we&nbsp;find Russia weakened and divided into apanages, we&nbsp;have only two noteworthy princes among a score of&nbsp;unimportant persons,—Vladimir Monomakh and Andrew.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The death of Andrew, whose murderers were not brought to justice, was followed by many petty wars.&nbsp;The only event, however, of any importance for a considerable time is the battle of Lipetsk (near Pereiaslavl&nbsp;Zaliesski) in 1215, in which George, son of Vsevolod,&nbsp;brother of Andrew, was defeated by the combined troops&nbsp;of Novgorod, Pskoff, and Smolensk. In 1220 we hear of&nbsp;Nijni-Novgorod being founded. A prince of considerable importance was Roman of Volhynia, to whom the&nbsp;inhabitants of Galicia offered the government of their&nbsp;principality, but he was superseded by another Vladimir,&nbsp;and did not get the crown till after a great deal of&nbsp;hard fighting. He is said by Kadlubek, the Polish&nbsp;historian, to have acted with ferocious cruelty. In 1205&nbsp;he was killed in a battle with the Poles. In 1224 we&nbsp;have the first invasion of Russia by the Mongols. Daniel of&nbsp;Galicia was one of the last of the Russian princes to make&nbsp;his submission to Batu (1238). He died in 1264. In&nbsp;the 14th century the principality of Galicia was lost in&nbsp;the Polish republic, having been annexed to Lithuania. It&nbsp;joined the fortunes of that state in its union with Poland&nbsp;at the time of the marriage of Jagietlo with Jadwiga.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">AVe now come to the third division of our subject— Russia under the yoke of the Mongols, viz., from 1238 to&nbsp;1462. This is indeed a dreary period, in which the&nbsp;political and material development of the country was&nbsp;delayed by its complete enslavement. The first occasion&nbsp;on which the Russians came into contact with their&nbsp;Mongolian invaders was in 1224, when, in company&nbsp;with their allies, the Polovtzes, they suffered a complete&nbsp;defeat on the banks of the Kalka, near where it flows&nbsp;into the sea of Azoff, and adjoining the site of the&nbsp;present town of Mariupol. On this occasion, however,&nbsp;the Mongols only marched a little way up the river&nbsp;Dnieper, and retired after devastating the country. In&nbsp;1238 they reappeared, and after destroying Bolgari, the&nbsp;capital of the Finnish Bulgarians on the Volga, advanced&nbsp;against Ryazan, which was plundered and burned, with&nbsp;adjoining cities. They then defeated the army of Suzdal,&nbsp;at Kolomna, on the Oka ; after which they burned Moscow,&nbsp;Suzdal, Yaroslavl, and other important towns. The grand-duke Yuri of Suzdal had encamped on the river Sit, almost&nbsp;on the frontiers of the territory of Novgorod. He was&nbsp;there defeated and was decapitated on the field of battle,&nbsp;while his nephew A’asilko had his throat cut for refusing&nbsp;to serve Batu. After taking Tver and advancing within&nbsp;fifty leagues of Novgorod, the Mongols turned south and&nbsp;occupied the two following years (1239-1240) in ravaging&nbsp;southern Russia. They then burned Pereiaslavl and&nbsp;Tchernigoff, and Mangu, the grandson of Jenghiz Khan,&nbsp;directed his march against Kieff. The noise of the great&nbsp;host proceeding to the capture of the fated city is graphically described by the chronicler. The city was taken and&nbsp;given up to pillage, not even the graves being respected.&nbsp;A olhynia and Galicia followed the fate of the other principalities, and all Russia was now under the yoke of the&nbsp;Mongols, except the territory of Novgorod.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The subsequent movements of these barbarians in Hungary and Moravia cannot be described here. It will&nbsp;suffice to say that soon afterwards Batu turned eastwards.&nbsp;He next founded on the Volga the city of Sarai (the&nbsp;Palace), which became the capital of the powerful Mon-golian empire, the Golden Horde. Here also congregated&nbsp;the remains of the Petchenegs, the Polovtzes, and other&nbsp;tribes, and to these barbarians Russia was for a long time&nbsp;tributary. In 1272 the Mongolian hordes embraced&nbsp;Islam. Yaroslaff, who entered into his territory of Suzdal&nbsp;after the death of his brother Yuri, found his hereditary&nbsp;domains completely devastated. He had commenced rebuilding the ruined town, when he was summoned by&nbsp;Batu to do him homage in his new capital of Sarai. This,&nbsp;however, was not considered sufficient, and the poor prince&nbsp;was obliged to betake himself to the court of the great&nbsp;khan, which was at the further end of Asia, on the banks&nbsp;of the river Amur. His title was confirmed, but on his&nbsp;return he died of the fatigues of the journey. He was&nbsp;succeeded in Suzdal by his son Andrew (1246-1252).&nbsp;His other son Alexander reigned at Novgorod the Great,&nbsp;and gained the surname of Nevski from his celebrated&nbsp;victory over the Swedes in 1240. He and Dmitri Donskoi&nbsp;are the only great figures of this period of national abasement. Alexander Nevski has become consecrated in the&nbsp;memories of the people, and is now one of the leading&nbsp;Russian saints. In spite, however, of his services to the&nbsp;people of Novgorod, he afterwards quarrelled with them&nbsp;and retired to Pereiaslavl Zaliesski. But the citizens were&nbsp;soon glad to betake themselves to his help. On being&nbsp;invaded by the German Sword-bearing Knights, who had&nbsp;established themselves in Livonia in the year 1201, and&nbsp;an army of Finns, Alexander was summoned, like another&nbsp;Camillus, and defeated the enemy on Lake Peipus in what&nbsp;was called the “Battle of the Ice” in 1242. He entered&nbsp;Novgorod in triumph with his prisoners. In spite of all&nbsp;this brilliant success, Alexander was unable to resist the&nbsp;power of the Golden Horde, and was obliged to go to&nbsp;Sarai to do homage to the khan. He was accompanied&nbsp;by his brother Andrew. The ceremony was always&nbsp;attended by many degrading acts of submission on the&nbsp;part of the tributary prince. In 1260 the Novgorodians,&nbsp;who had so long preserved the liberty of their republic&nbsp;uninjured, consented to submit to the khan and pay&nbsp;tribute ; Alexander died before reaching VIadimir on his&nbsp;return from one of these humiliating journeys. A great&nbsp;part of western Russia was now consolidated by the&nbsp;Lithuanian princes into a state, the capital of which was&nbsp;Vilna and the language AVhite Russian. To this many of&nbsp;the western provinces of Russia gravitated, and by the&nbsp;marriage of the Polish heiress Jadwiga with Jagiefto of&nbsp;Lithuania these provinces went to Poland and were not&nbsp;reannexed to Russia till a much later period. The eastern&nbsp;portion of Russia grouped itself round Moscow, which is&nbsp;first heard of in the chronicles in 1147. We find four considerable eastern states—Ryazan, Suzdal, Tver, and Moscow.&nbsp;For a century after its foundation we hear nothing of this&nbsp;city, the name of which is certainly Finnish. AVe are told&nbsp;that it was burned by the Mongols in 1237, and that a&nbsp;brother of Alexander Nevski was killed there in 1248, in&nbsp;a battle against the Lithuanians. We have seen that the&nbsp;political centre of the country has constantly changed.&nbsp;From Novgorod it went to Kieff, from Kieff to Vladimir,&nbsp;the capital of Suzdal, and from Vladimir to Moscow ; we&nbsp;shall soon find that owing to the vigorous policy of its&nbsp;rulers this principality became the nucleus of the great&nbsp;Russian empire, and gathered round it the adjacent states.&nbsp;Its true founder was Daniel, a son of Alexander Nevski,&nbsp;who added to it the cities of Pereiaslavl Zaliesski and&nbsp;Kolomna. At his death in 1303 he was the first to be&nbsp;buried in the church of St Michael the Archangel, where&nbsp;all the Russian sovereigns were laid till the days of Peter&nbsp;the Great. Since that time, with the exception of Peter&nbsp;IL, they have been interred in the church of the Petro-pavlovski fortress at St Petersburg. Daniel was followed&nbsp;on the throne by his sons Yuri and Ivan in succession. Yuri&nbsp;Danilovich (1303-1326) took possession of Mozhaisk.
