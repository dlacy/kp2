All wounds inflicted by strange or suspected dogs should be immediately attended to and treated by suction,&nbsp;washing, and expression, until proper surgical treatment&nbsp;can be adopted. In those countries in which the disease&nbsp;has not yet appeared, in order to prevent its admission,&nbsp;the importation of dogs should be forbidden or an extended&nbsp;period of quarantine imposed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We may here allude to the results of Pasteur’s experiments in rabies. By passing modified virus into the bodies of dogs he has discovered that they are protected&nbsp;from an attack of the disease—are, in fact, rendered&nbsp;refractory to rabies. For instance, rabific virus is obtained&nbsp;from a rabbit which has died after inoculation by trepanning, and after a period of incubation longer by some&nbsp;days than the shortest period in these animals, which is&nbsp;invariably between seven and eight days subsequent to&nbsp;inoculation with the most active virus. The virus of the&nbsp;rabbit in the period of long incubation is inoculated by&nbsp;trepanning into a second rabbit, the virus of this into a&nbsp;third; and on each occasion the virus, which becomes&nbsp;more and more potent, is inoculated into a dog. The&nbsp;latter at last becomes capable of supporting what would&nbsp;be to other dogs a deadly virus, and is entirely proof&nbsp;against rabies either by intravenous inoculation, by trepanning, or by the virus of a rabid animal. By using the&nbsp;blood of rabid animals in certain determinate conditions&nbsp;Pasteur has been able to greatly simplify the operations&nbsp;of inoculation, and to render dogs most decidedly refractory to the malady. There is great importance attached&nbsp;to the suggestion that now, and until rabies has been extinguished altogether by inoculation, it may be possible&nbsp;to prevent development of the disease after bites from&nbsp;rabid dogs, owing to the long duration of the incubative&nbsp;period. Admitting that rabies is produced by the bite of&nbsp;rabid animals only, and that Pasteur’s inoculations are&nbsp;really protective, it is suggested that a law compelling all&nbsp;dogs to be so protected would in the end extirpate the&nbsp;disease. But certain important points have yet to be&nbsp;decided before any definite conclusion can be arrived&nbsp;at.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(g. fl.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RABUTIN, </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roger de, Comte de Bussy</span><span class="font2"> (1618-1693), commonly known as </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bussy-Rabutin</span><span class="font2"> (and for shortness&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bussy),</span><span class="font2"> is perhaps the most characteristic figure among&nbsp;the lesser noblesse of France in the 17th century, as La&nbsp;Rochefoucauld is among the greater. Bussy, however,&nbsp;except in point of gallantry and literary power, chiefly&nbsp;illustrated the evil sides of the character. He represented&nbsp;a family of distinction and age in Burgundy (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Sevign¿,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">Madame de), and his father was L6onor de Rabutin, a&nbsp;soldier of merit and a man of position, holding the lieutenant-generalship of the province of Nivernais. Bussy-Rabutin (it is perhaps advisable to add the family name&nbsp;to distinguish him from the hardly less famous Bussy&nbsp;d’Amboise) was born in 1618. He was the third son, but&nbsp;by the death of his elder brothers became the representative&nbsp;of the family. He entered the army when he was only&nbsp;sixteen and fought through several campaigns, succeeding&nbsp;his father in the office of “ mestre de camp.” But he very&nbsp;early distinguished himself in other ways than that of&nbsp;military service, and in 1641 was sent to the Bastille by&nbsp;Richelieu for some months as a punishment for neglect of&nbsp;his duties in running after his ladyloves. In 1643 he&nbsp;married a cousin, Gabrielle de Toulongeon, who seems to&nbsp;have been fond of him, and for a short time he left the&nbsp;army. But in 1644 he again bought a commission and&nbsp;for some years was closely connected with the great CondA&nbsp;His wife died, and he became more famous, or at least more&nbsp;notorious, than ever by an attempt to abduct Madame de&nbsp;Miramion, a rich widow. This affair was with some difficulty made up and Bussy afterwards married Louise de</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">Rouville. When the Fronde broke out he, like others, went from party to party, but finally passed to the royal side.&nbsp;He fought with some distinction both in the civil war and&nbsp;on foreign service, and in 1655 he went to serve under&nbsp;Turenne in Flanders. He served there for several campaigns and distinguished himself at the battle of the Dunes&nbsp;and elsewhere ; but he did not get on well with his general,&nbsp;and his quarrelsome disposition, his overweening vanity,&nbsp;and his habit of composing libellous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">chansons</span><span class="font2"> by degrees&nbsp;made him the enemy of most persons of position both in&nbsp;the army and at court. In the year 1659 he fell into&nbsp;disgrace for having taken part in an orgy or series of&nbsp;orgies at Roissy near Paris during Holy Week, which caused&nbsp;great scandal, and shortly afterwards he began to compose&nbsp;for the amusement of his mistress, Madame de Montglas,&nbsp;his famous </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules.</span><span class="font2"> This book—a&nbsp;series of sketches of the chief ladies of the court, not&nbsp;without wit, but much less remarkable for wit than for ill&nbsp;nature and licence—circulated freely in manuscript and&nbsp;had numerous spurious sequels. One of these stung the&nbsp;king, and Bussy was in 1665 sent to the Bastille, where&nbsp;he remained for more than a year, and from which he was&nbsp;only liberated on condition of retiring to his estates.&nbsp;Here he abode in what was then called exile for seventeen&nbsp;years. He was then restored to a modified degree of royal&nbsp;favour, but never received any great mark of it, and died&nbsp;in 1693.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although a man of considerable abilities, Bussy had very little in his character that was either amiable or estimable. Despite his&nbsp;extravagant pride of birth and rank, there is much reason for&nbsp;acquiescing in the verdict pronounced on him (by an anonymous&nbsp;contemporary apparently), that he was “a coxcomb, who never,&nbsp;either at court or in camp, lost the taste for bad company and the&nbsp;air of a rustic ” ; his bravery was undoubted, but he seems to have&nbsp;much overrated his own military ability. He libelled friends and&nbsp;foes alike, and any toleration which might be extended to his&nbsp;innumerable gallantries is lessened by his incorrigible habit of&nbsp;telling tales and his spiteful scandal - mongering against women&nbsp;who had left him or whom he had left. He was, however, possessed&nbsp;of much literary power. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire Amoureuse</span><span class="font1"> is in its most&nbsp;striking passages merely adapted from Petronius, and, except in&nbsp;a few portraits, its attractions are chiefly those of the scandalous&nbsp;chronicle. But his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires,</span><span class="font1"> published after his death, are extremely lively and characteristic, and his voluminous correspondence yields in variety and interest to few collections of the kind,&nbsp;except Madame de Sévigné’s, who indeed is represented in it to&nbsp;a great extent, and whose letters first appeared in it. The literary&nbsp;and historical student, therefore, owes Bussy some thanks. But&nbsp;it is impossible not to see that he united some of the worst characteristics of an aristocracy on the way to decadence—relaxed morals,&nbsp;a glaring indifference to duty and to all motives but self-interest,&nbsp;insolence in prosperity, servility in adverse circumstances, jealousy&nbsp;of others more favoured than himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The best edition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire Amoureuse des Gaules</span><span class="font0"> is that of Boiteau and Livet in the Bibliothèque Elzévirienne (4 vols., Paris, 1856-76), of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mémoires&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Correspondance</span><span class="font0"> that of Lalanne (8 vols., Paris, 1857-59). Bussy wrote other&nbsp;things, of which the most important, his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Genealogy of the Rabutin Family,</span><span class="font0"> remained in M8. till 1867.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RACCOON. This name,@@<sup>1</sup> familiar to all readers of works on American natural history, is borne by a small&nbsp;carnivore belonging to that section of the order which&nbsp;contains the bears, weasels, badgers, &amp;c. (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Mammalia,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">vol. xv. p. 440). The raccoon resembles in many respects&nbsp;a diminutive bear, both in its general build and in the proportions of its skull and teeth, which last are broad, blunt,&nbsp;and rounded, and more suited for a semi-vegetarian than&nbsp;for an exclusively animal diet. Its other more important&nbsp;zoological characters, with an account of its systematic&nbsp;position, have been already noted in the article just referred to. The common North-American raccoon </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Procyon&nbsp;lotor)</span><span class="font2"> is a clumsy thickly-built animal about the size of a&nbsp;badger, with a coat of long coarse greyish brown hairs,&nbsp;short ears, and a bushy black and white ringed tail.
