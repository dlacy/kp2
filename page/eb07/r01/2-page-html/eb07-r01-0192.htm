<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">false meshes</span><span class="font1"> equidistantly, then twenty rows of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font1"> netting, then a row with five </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">false meshes ;</span><span class="font1"> repeat this manœuvre ;&nbsp;then net thirty-six rows of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font1"> netting, and the next row in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font1"> twine ; thus you have an upper and a lower row, as&nbsp;shown in fig. 5, the dotted lines representing the lower row.&nbsp;Cut off the thread which has worked the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">upper</span><span class="font1"> row, leaving&nbsp;an end ; empty your needle, and wind on it the thread that&nbsp;proceeds from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lower</span><span class="font1"> row, and work on with the single&nbsp;twine as follows, taking care, however, to pick up only the&nbsp;loops of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lower</span><span class="font1"> row as you go round. Net on the same&nbsp;spool fourteen rows of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font1"> netting, then at equal distances&nbsp;in the circumference of the fifteenth row set in eight </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stole&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">meshes, then net two rows of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font1"> netting, in the next row&nbsp;eight stole meshes in a line with the others ; repeat this&nbsp;action three times more. After you have for the fifth time&nbsp;set in your </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stole</span><span class="font1"> meshes, net a row of plain netting ; lay&nbsp;aside the two-inch spool, and take a twelve-inch and net&nbsp;one row. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">valve</span><span class="font1"> is now finished, and must be reflected&nbsp;inwards to gain its right position. You now take your&nbsp;needle, charged with single twine, and join on to that end&nbsp;which was left at the upper row where the valve issued from&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">body</span><span class="font1"> of the engine ; with the two-inch spool net eleven&nbsp;rows of dead netting. In the next row set in five </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">false&nbsp;meshes</span><span class="font1"> at equal distances each from the other, and continue to set in these at every third row eleven times in the&nbsp;same line. This done, make seven rows of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font1"> netting,&nbsp;then one row on a four-inch spool in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font1"> twine. Through&nbsp;this last row a pliant stick is passed, about six feet long, and&nbsp;bent into a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bow</span><span class="font1"> (BBB, fig. S) ; a piece of cord keeps the&nbsp;extremities in place, answering to the string of the archer’s&nbsp;bow ; the lower meshes of the net’s mouth are strung on&nbsp;this cord, see fig. 8. A weight is generally attached to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bow</span><span class="font1"> at its extremities, somew'here towards BB. Four hoops&nbsp;are lashed round the net at HHHH, to prevent its collapsing ; these are larger as they proceed from the point to the&nbsp;mouth, and are made of slighter wood than the bow, the&nbsp;smallest being about one foot three inches diameter, and&nbsp;the largest two feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Some </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hoop-nets</span><span class="font1"> have more tnan one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">valve.</span><span class="font1"> In that case the hoops must always be placed at the entrance of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">valves,</span><span class="font1"> and many netters make a row of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font1"> twine at&nbsp;those parts, to give additional strength where there is most&nbsp;strain on the netting. The large loops at the bottom of&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">funnel</span><span class="font1"> are tied together, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fasces</span><span class="font1"> of equal number of&nbsp;loops, to four lines, and these are made fast to another line&nbsp;which is threaded through the last row of meshes belonging to the point of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">body,</span><span class="font1"> and which, being drawn tight,&nbsp;closes up the entrance at that part. All the lines are then&nbsp;tied to a support at P, and thus the net is kept extended.&nbsp;The principle of this engine is analogous to that of the common mouse-trap. When there is only one valve (as in fig.&nbsp;8, V), the fisherman withdraws the fish by loosing the line&nbsp;that closes the body of the engine at P ; but when there&nbsp;are more than one valve, he makes a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regard</span><span class="font1"> in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">body&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">between each hoop. A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regard</span><span class="font1"> is thus made : Net round&nbsp;and round, and when arrived at the part wherein you wish&nbsp;to put a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regard, return on your worh ;</span><span class="font1"> and when you again&nbsp;come to the place where you altered your mode of netting,&nbsp;return again ; and thus continue until you have made the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">regard</span><span class="font1"> of sufficient length, then work round and round as&nbsp;before.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tunnel</span><span class="font1"> for partridges is made like the hoop-net, but without valves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trawl</span><span class="font1"> is a very large and rapacious net, and much discussion has been held as to whether it should be permitted. It would seem, however, upon a careful examination of evidence, that, under proper restrictions, it is not&nbsp;detrimental to the fisheries. This engine is composed of&nbsp;two separate pieces, called the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">upper</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lower leaf ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the meshes are about two inches square. For the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">under&nbsp;leaf</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">blade,</span><span class="font1"> net 160 loops in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font1"> twine, two rows, then&nbsp;with single twine net a plain row ; in the next, set in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stole&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">mesh at about the sixth mesh from the beginning, and another at about the sixth mesh from the end of the row ; net&nbsp;three rows of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font1"> netting, then set in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stole</span><span class="font1"> meshes as before; repeat this once again, afterwards go on setting in&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stole meshes</span><span class="font1"> less frequently, </span><span class="font2">t. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.</span><span class="font1"> leave five rows of dead netting between, until the width of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">blade</span><span class="font1"> is reduced to&nbsp;thirty-six meshes, then net about five feet for the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hose</span><span class="font1"> or&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tail</span><span class="font1"> H, fig. 9. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wings</span><span class="font1"> are now to be set on to this </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leaf.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">For this purpose you must begin working at the other extremity, or top of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leaf,</span><span class="font1"> as at T or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">t ;</span><span class="font1"> net fifty-six loops&nbsp;and stop ; return on your work ; net again to the end of&nbsp;your row (the third), and here, quite at the extremity, set&nbsp;in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">false</span><span class="font1"> mesh ; but when, in the course of netting row&nbsp;after row, you come to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">false</span><span class="font1"> meshes, do </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font1"> take them&nbsp;up, but let them </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hang,</span><span class="font1"> as is shown in fig. 9 at B and B&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wings</span><span class="font1"> W and W. At the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">commencement</span><span class="font1"> of every&nbsp;row which alternates with those to which you add a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">false&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">mesh, at about three loops from the beginning, set in a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stole&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">mesh ; thus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the false</span><span class="font1"> meshes will always be on one side, and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">stole</span><span class="font1"> meshes on the other side of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wing,</span><span class="font1"> which will&nbsp;thus be diminished at last to eighteen meshes. When this&nbsp;is effected, net two rows in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font1"> twine, not adding or diminishing. Thus one </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wing</span><span class="font1"> is done ; net the other in the&nbsp;same way, and take care that the one is exactly the same&nbsp;as the other. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">under</span><span class="font1"> leaf being now finished, we pass on&nbsp;to the structure of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">upper blade,</span><span class="font1"> fig. 10. Net 180 </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">loops&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font1"> twine, two rows ; then with single twine forty rows&nbsp;of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dead</span><span class="font1"> netting; diminish evenly and gradually from 180&nbsp;to 160 meshes, taking notice that this reduction must be&nbsp;made before you come to a level with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">double</span><span class="font1"> rows&nbsp;whence the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wings</span><span class="font1"> rose in the other </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">blade.</span><span class="font1"> Diminish from&nbsp;160 to thirty-six, as you did when working down the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">lower&nbsp;leaf,</span><span class="font1"> making the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hose</span><span class="font1"> as before. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">blades</span><span class="font1"> being now finished, must be joined together down their sides, as the sides&nbsp;of a sack are ; and a rope, acting as a binding along the&nbsp;seams, is sewn on, in the same way as the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">head-rope</span><span class="font1"> of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trammel.</span><span class="font1"> Round the top of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">upper blade</span><span class="font1"> a rope is&nbsp;strung through the meshes, and carried round the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bosom&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">BBB, fig. 9, being sewn to, and not threaded through, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hanging false loops</span><span class="font1"> of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wings</span><span class="font1"> W, W. The two blades are&nbsp;then sewn together at certain parts to form </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pockets,</span><span class="font1"> in the&nbsp;direction of A, A, A, A, A, A; </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">oooooo,</span><span class="font1"> being the orifice of the pockets. At L, L, loops of rope are bent, to&nbsp;which lines are hitched for hauling the net out of the sea&nbsp;into the boat. The two </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">blades</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">leaves</span><span class="font1"> must be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">exactly&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">of the same length ; for, when joined, the top row of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wings</span><span class="font1"> must be even with the top row of the back of the&nbsp;net or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">upper blade,</span><span class="font1"> and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hose</span><span class="font1"> should meet no less accurately at the bottom. When the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trawl</span><span class="font1"> is in the sea, a long&nbsp;beam of about thirty feet in length and seven inches in circumference is lashed to the top of the net, keeping the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">wings</span><span class="font1"> and back extended from point to point. This beam&nbsp;is let into irons, called </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trawl-heads,</span><span class="font1"> at each extremity, which&nbsp;serve to sink it. A heavy rope, usually made of old netting,&nbsp;tightly twisted and bound round with strong twine, is lashed along the bosom of the net. Thus </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mounted,</span><span class="font1"> the engine&nbsp;is lowered into the sea, being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trailed</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trawled</span><span class="font1"> along the&nbsp;bottom by means of a rope attached to the boat’s mast, and&nbsp;communicating with each end of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">beam</span><span class="font1"> by a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bridle.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bosom</span><span class="font1"> touches the ground, and the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">upper blade</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">beam&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">floats over it ; the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bosom’s</span><span class="font1"> rope disturbs the fish at the bottom ; they are, however, stopped from escaping, by striking&nbsp;against the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">upper blade,</span><span class="font1"> which extends over the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bosom,</span><span class="font1"> so&nbsp;they swim down the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trawl</span><span class="font1"> to the hose; but this is tied up,&nbsp;so they next attempt to return towards the mouth of the&nbsp;net ; but in their way they fall into the pockets, which only&nbsp;open inwards towards the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">hose,</span><span class="font1"> and thus are secured. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Λ&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">day-net</span><span class="font1"> is used for catching larks from 14th September to&nbsp;14th November; after that, until 25th February, the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trammel.</span><span class="font1"> The reason of this is, that during the latter division of</span></p>
