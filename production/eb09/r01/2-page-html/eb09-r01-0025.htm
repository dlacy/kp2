<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus radiation is one phenomenon, and (as we shall&nbsp;find) the spectrum of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">black body</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> (a conception roughly&nbsp;realized in the carbon poles of an electric lamp) is continuous from the longest possible wave-length to the shortest&nbsp;which it is hot enough to emit. These various groups of&nbsp;rays, however, are perceived by us in very different ways,&nbsp;whether by direct impressions of sense or by the different&nbsp;modes in which they effect physical changes or transformations. The only way as yet known to us of treating them&nbsp;all alike is to convert their energy into the heat-form and&nbsp;measure it as such. This we can do in a satisfactory&nbsp;manner by the thermo-electric pile and galvanometer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of the history of the gradual development of the&nbsp;theory of radiation we can give only the main features.&nbsp;The apparent concentration of cold by a concave mirror,&nbsp;which had been long before observed by Porta, was rediscovered by Pictet, and led to the extremely important&nbsp;enunciation of the Law of Exchanges by Prévost in 1791.&nbsp;As we have already seen, Prévost’s idea of the nature of&nbsp;radiation was a corpuscular one, no doubt greatly influenced&nbsp;in this direction by the speculations of Lesage (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Atom).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">But the value of his theory as a concise statement of&nbsp;facts and a mode of co-ordinating them is not thereby&nbsp;materially lessened. We give his own statements in the&nbsp;following close paraphrase, in which the italics are retained, from sect. ix. of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Du Calorique Rayonnant&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(Geneva, 1809).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“1. Free caloric is a radiant fluid. And because caloric becomes free at the surfaces of bodies </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">every point of the surface of a body is&nbsp;a centre, towards and from which filaments</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (filets) </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">of caloric move&nbsp;in all directions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“2. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Heat equilibrium</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> between two neighbouring free spaces </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">consists in equality of exchange.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">‘ ‘ 3. When equilibrium is interfered with it is re-established by inequalities of exchange. And, in a medium of constant temperature, a hotter or a colder body reaches this temperature according&nbsp;to the law that </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">difference of temperature diminishes in geometrical&nbsp;'progression in successive equal intervals of time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“4. If into </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">a locality at uniform temperature a reflecting</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> or refracting </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">surface</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> is introduced, it </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">has no effect in the way of changing the temperature</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> at any point in that locality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“5.</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> If into a locality otherwise at uniform temperature </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">there is introduced a warmer or a colder body, and next a reflecting</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> or refracting </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">surface, the points on which the rays emanating from the body are&nbsp;thrown by these surfaces will be affected,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> in the sense of being&nbsp;warmed if the body is warmer, and cooled if it is colder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“ 6. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A reflecting body,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> heated or cooled in its interior, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">will acquire the surrounding temperature more slowly</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> than would a non-reflector.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“ 7. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">A reflecting body,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> heated or cooled in its interior, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">will less affect</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> (in the way of heating or cooling it) another body placed at a&nbsp;little distance than would a non-reflecting body under the same&nbsp;circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">“ All these consequences have been verified by experiment, except that which regards the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">refraction</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> of cold. This experiment remains&nbsp;to be made, and I confidently predict the result, at least if the&nbsp;refraction of cold can be accurately observed. This result is indicated in the fourth and fifth consequences [above], and they might&nbsp;thus be subjected to a new test. It is scarcely necessary to point&nbsp;out here the precautions requisite to guard against illusory results&nbsp;of all kinds in this matter.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There the matter rested, so far as theory is concerned, for more than half a century. Leslie and, after&nbsp;him, many others added fact by fact, up to the time of De&nbsp;la Provostaye and Desains, whose experiments pointed to&nbsp;a real improvement of the theory in the form of specialization. But, though such experiments indicated, on the&nbsp;whole, a proportionality between the radiating and absorbing powers of bodies and a diminution of both in the case&nbsp;of highly reflecting surfaces, the anomalies frequently met&nbsp;with (depending on the then unrecognized colour-differences&nbsp;of various radiations) prevented any grand generalization.&nbsp;The first real step of the general theory, in advance of&nbsp;what Prévost had achieved, and it was one of immense&nbsp;import, was made by Balfour Stewart in 1858. Before we&nbsp;take it up, however, we may briefly consider Prévost’s statements, putting aside his erroneous views as to the nature&nbsp;of heat ; and we must also introduce some results of the&nbsp;splendid investigations of Sadi Carnot (1824), which cast&nbsp;an entirely new light on the whole subject of heat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prévost’s leading idea was that all bodies, whether&nbsp;cold or hot, are constantly radiating heat. This of itself&nbsp;was a very great step. It is distinctly enunciated in the&nbsp;term “ exchange ” which he employs. And from the way&nbsp;in which he introduces it it is obvious that he means&nbsp;(though he does not expressly say so) that the radiation&nbsp;from a body depends on its own nature and temperature&nbsp;alone, and is independent altogether of the nature and&nbsp;temperature of any adjacent body. This also was a step&nbsp;in advance, and of the utmost value. It will be seen later&nbsp;that Prévost was altogether wrong in his assumption of&nbsp;the geometrical rate of adjustment of differences of&nbsp;temperature,—a statement originally made by Newton,&nbsp;but true only approximately, and even so for very small&nbsp;temperature differences alone. Newton in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Queries</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> to&nbsp;the third book of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Optics</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> distinctly recognizes the propagation of heat from a hot body to a cold one by the&nbsp;vibrations of an intervening medium. But he says nothing as to bodies of the same temperature.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Carnot we owe the proposition that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the thermal&nbsp;motivity of a system cannot he increased by internal actions.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">A system in which all the parts are at the same temperature has no thermal motivity, for bodies at different&nbsp;temperatures are required in order to work a heat-engine,&nbsp;so as to convert part of their heat into work. Hence, if&nbsp;the contents of an enclosure which is impervious to heat&nbsp;are at any instant at one and the same temperature, no&nbsp;changes of temperature can take place among them. This&nbsp;is certainly true so far as our modes of measurement are&nbsp;concerned, because the particles of matter (those of a&nbsp;gas, for instance) are excessively small in comparison with&nbsp;the dimensions of any of our forms of apparatus for measuring temperatures. Something akin to this statement&nbsp;has often been assumed as a direct result of experiment :&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a number of bodies</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(of any kinds</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">within the same impervious enclosure</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">which contains no source of heat</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">will ultimately acquire the same temperature.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> This form is more&nbsp;general than that above, inasmuch as it involves considerations of dissipation of energy. Either of them, were&nbsp;it strictly true, would suffice for our present purpose.&nbsp;But neither statement can be considered as rigorously true.&nbsp;We may employ them, however, in our reasoning as true&nbsp;in the statistical sense ; but we must not be surprised if&nbsp;we should find that the assumption of their rigorous truth&nbsp;may in some special cases lead us to theoretical results&nbsp;which are inconsistent with experimental facts,—</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> if&nbsp;we should find that deviations from an average, which are&nbsp;on far too minute a scale to be directly detected by any of&nbsp;our most delicate instruments, may be seized upon and&nbsp;converted into observable phenomena by some of the&nbsp;almost incomparably more delicate systems which we call&nbsp;individual particles of matter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next great advance was made by Balfour&nbsp;Stewart.@@<sup>1</sup> The grand novelty which he introduced, and&nbsp;from which all his varied results follow almost intuitively,&nbsp;is the idea of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the absolute uniformity</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(qualitative as well as&nbsp;quantitative)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of the radiation at all points, and in all directions, within an enclosure impervious to heat, when thermal&nbsp;equilibrium has once been arrived at. (So strongly does&nbsp;he insist on this point that he even states that, whatever&nbsp;be the nature of the bodies in the enclosure, the radiation&nbsp;there will, when equilibrium is established, be that of a&nbsp;black body at the same temperature. He does not expressly&nbsp;say that the proposition will still be true even if the bodies&nbsp;can radiate, and therefore absorb, one definite wave-length&nbsp;only ; but this is a legitimate deduction from his state-</span></p>
