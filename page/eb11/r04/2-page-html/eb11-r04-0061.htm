<p><span class="font1">ROMANS, EPISTLE TO THE. In this book of the New Testament, the apostle Paul begins, after a brief pregnant&nbsp;introduction </span><span class="font2">(i. </span><span class="font1">1-7), by explaining that he had hitherto been&nbsp;prevented from carrying out his cherished project of visiting&nbsp;the church of Rome, whose faith was world-wide (i. 8 f.). Meanwhile, he outlines the gospel which he preached as an exhibition&nbsp;of God’s righteousness, ex </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rrtoTeus as</span><span class="font1"> 7rf&lt;mF. This forms the&nbsp;leading theme of the epistle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Both Gentile (i. 18-32) and Jew (ii. 1, iii. 20)<sup>@@1</sup> alike have missed this righteousness up till now, but the revelation of God in Jesus&nbsp;Christ (iii. 21-31) had brought the divine boon within reach of all.&nbsp;The condition of its reception was not nationality but faith. Hence,&nbsp;as Paul stops for a moment to argue (iv. 1-25), the Jew cannot claim&nbsp;any preference; Abraham himself, before circumcision and the law&nbsp;came into force, was a man of faith, and consequently all believers&nbsp;(not all legal Jews, iv. 16) are true descendants of Abraham.<sup>@@2&nbsp;</sup>Returning to tne blissful results of this ôt/catoaûi'ij revealed in Jesus&nbsp;Christ (v. 1-11), Paul proceeds to contrast these with the sombre&nbsp;effects produced in humanity by the fall of Adam. Life had now&nbsp;triumphed over death, grace over sin (v. 12 f.). But the super-session of the law, which was bound up with the régime of sin and&nbsp;death, does not mean the relaxation of the moral bond.. On the&nbsp;contrary (vi. 1 f.), the reception of God’s grace and spirit implies&nbsp;the death of the believing man to sin. The struggle of the soul <sup>@@3</sup>&nbsp;between the thwarting power of sin and the ethical demands of&nbsp;the law (vii. 1 f.) cannot be ended happily save by the.interposition&nbsp;of Jesus Christ, whose Spirit guarantees, a sound life in this world&nbsp;and life eternal in the world to come (viii. 12 f.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The splendid and unfettered<sup>@@4</sup> prospects of faith, which thus break on the apostle’s vision, only serve to deepen his distress in one&nbsp;direction.<sup>@@5</sup> As a theologian and as a patriot, he is confronted with&nbsp;the problem of Israel's collective repudiation of a boon to which&nbsp;their own history, as he read it, clearly pointed. Reverting to the&nbsp;thought of ii. 17 f. and iv. 1, Paul now essays, in ix.-xi., to show&nbsp;how this unbelief of Israel is to be reconciled with the justice and&nbsp;the promises of God. He begins by showing, as in Gal. iv. 7 f.&nbsp;(ef. Rom. ii. 28-29), that mere physical descent could not entitle&nbsp;a Jew to the promises. Besides (ix. 14-29), no Jew has the right&nbsp;to challenge God’s sovereign freedom. If God determines to extend&nbsp;the promise of faith to the Gentiles, who shall accuse Him of injustice?&nbsp;The rejection of the Jews is their own fault, due to their obstinacy&nbsp;and legalism (ix. 30-x. 21). Finally, Paul tries to see this fact of&nbsp;Israel’s unbelief in the light of a wide religious philosophy of history ;&nbsp;it (xi. I—10) cannot be anything but a temporary and partial&nbsp;(xi. n-24)<sup>@@6</sup> phase; the future will clear up the present; the final</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">result will be the inclusion of all Israel in the heritage of the messianic kingdom of Christ. The prospect of this consummation&nbsp;stirs him to an outburst of adoration, with which the whole section&nbsp;ends (xi. 33-16).<sup>@@7</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Applying tne thought of God’s mercy to the obligations of believing men (xii. 1-2), Paul proceeds now to sketch the ethical duties of&nbsp;Christians in the church (xii. 3-21), in society, and in the state&nbsp;(xiii. 1-7); love is the supreme law (xiii. 8-10), and the nearness&nbsp;of the end the supreme motive to morality (xiii. 11-14). These&nbsp;considerations are still before Paul’s mind as he descends from&nbsp;general counsels, to a special problem of practical ethics, raised by&nbsp;the. varying attitude of Christians at Rome towards food offered&nbsp;to idols (xiv. 1 f.). After laying down the principle of individual&nbsp;responsibility, he appeals for charity and mutual consideration&nbsp;(xiv. 13-xv. 6), and for Christian forbearance.<sup>@@8 </sup>Finally, he exhorts&nbsp;all, Gentile and Jewish Christians alike (xv. 8-13), to unite in&nbsp;thanksgiving for God’s mercy to them in Christ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In a brief epilogue, the apostle justifies himself for having thus addressed the Roman Christians. He alleges (xv. 14 f.) his apostolic&nbsp;vocation and informs them of his future movements. With an&nbsp;appeal for their prayers and a brief benediction, the epistle then&nbsp;closes (xv. 30-33).. Jt ends as it began (i. 8 f.) with the apostle’s&nbsp;hope and plan of visiting Rome on a subsequent missionary tour.<sup>@@9</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rom. xvi. contains a separate note (1-23), together with a doxology (25-27). The former came from Paul’s pen, but&nbsp;it did not belong originally to this epistle.<sup>@@10</sup> In&nbsp;all likelihood it is a letter of commendation for&nbsp;Phoebe<sup>@@11</sup> which includes vers. 1-23 (so c.g.&nbsp;Wcizsacker, McGiffert and Julicher), though most break&nbsp;it off at ver. 20 (so Eichhorn, Ewald, Schulz, Renan, Weiss,&nbsp;Lipsius, von Soden, &amp;c.), while others do not begin it&nbsp;until ver. 3 (so </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Ewald, Schurer, Reuss and Mangold:&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Der Romer brief,</span><span class="font1"> pp. 136 f,). Vers. 21-23 might indeed follow&nbsp;xv. 33; but it is not Paul’s way to add salutations after a final&nbsp;Amen, and the passage connects as well with xvi. 20, though&nbsp;it may have lain originally (Julicher) between 16 and 17. The&nbsp;main reasons<sup>@@12</sup> for conjecturing that this section was addressed&nbsp;separately, not to Rome but to a city like Ephesus, lie in its&nbsp;contents. Paul was as yet a stranger to Rome, and it is extremely&nbsp;difficult to suppose that he already knew so many individuals&nbsp;there. The earlier tone of Romans shows that he was writing&nbsp;as a comparative stranger to strangers. Any touches of&nbsp;familiarity with the local circumstances (as in xiv.-xv.) are no&nbsp;more than might have percolated to him through bearing and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2</sup> Paul here unconsciously changes the conception of law. By introducing the example of Abraham he shows that the book of&nbsp;the law contains the doctrine of justification by faith., and through&nbsp;the latter, therefore, is not made of none effect. This proof rests,&nbsp;objectively regarded, on a fallacy; for the law, of which the validity&nbsp;is threatened by the doctrine of justification, is that part of the&nbsp;book of the law which demands the observance of all commands,&nbsp;not that which relates anything about Abraham. But this error&nbsp;of thought would be easily concealed from a mind with the rabbinical&nbsp;training of Paul’s” (Schmiedel, in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Hibbert Journal,</span><span class="font1"> 1902, pp. 548—&nbsp;549).</span></p>
