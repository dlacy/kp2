        <p><span class="font1">Hague, but he broke his promise on getting clear of England, and
                conveyed to William a duplicate of the invitation addressed&nbsp;to him by the
                English nobility, together with intelligence of&nbsp;affairs of state obtained
                through the countess of Sunderland.&nbsp;He landed with William at Torbay, and
                received substantial&nbsp;rewards for his undoubted services. Sworn of the
                privy&nbsp;council in 1689, Sidney was made gentleman of the bedchamber&nbsp;and
                colonel of the king’s regiment of footguards, and received&nbsp;the titles of Baron
                Milton and Viscount Sidney of Sheppcy. In&nbsp;1690 he received considerable grants
                of land from the confiscated&nbsp;estates of the Irish supporters of James II., much
                of which he&nbsp;lost, however, on the parliamentary investigation in 1699&nbsp;into
                the distribution of the Irish lands. William made him&nbsp;secretary of state in
                1690, pending the discovery of a better&nbsp;person. He was soon asked to resign,
                but was compensated&nbsp;by his appointment, in 1692, as lord-lieutenant of Ireland.
                His&nbsp;inability to cope with the difficulties of this position led to
                his&nbsp;recall in the next year, when he became master-general of
                the&nbsp;ordnance. He was created earl of Romney in May 1694, and&nbsp;he retained
                William’s confidence to the last, but on Anne’s&nbsp;accession he was dismissed from
                his various offices. He never&nbsp;married, and his titles became extinct on his
                death on the 8th&nbsp;of April 1704.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In 1801 the title of earl of Romney was revived in the family of
                Marsham. Sir Robert Marsham, Bart. (1685-1724), of Cuxton in&nbsp;Kent, was a member
                of parliament from 1708 to 1716, when he was&nbsp;created Baron of Romney. His
                grandson Charles, the 3rd Baron&nbsp;(1774-1811), was created earl of Romney in
                1801, and from him&nbsp;the present earl is descended.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">ROMNEY </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >(New Romney),</span><span class="font1"> a municipal borough and one of the Cinque
                Ports in the Ashford parliamentary division of Kent,&nbsp;England, 75 m. S.E. by E.
                of .London by the South-Eastern &amp;&nbsp;Chatham railway. Pop. (1901) 1328. It
                lies in the open, flat&nbsp;and low tract of Romney Marsh, part of a level extending
                from&nbsp;Winchelsea in the south-west to Hythe in the north-east, which&nbsp;was
                within historic times in great part covered by an estuarine&nbsp;inlet of the sea.
                The river Rother, which now has its mouth at&nbsp;Rye Harbour, formerly entered the
                sea here, but had its course&nbsp;wholly changed during a great storm in 1287, and
                the gradual&nbsp;accretion of land led to the decay, not only of Romney, but
                of&nbsp;Winchelsea and Rye as seaports. Romney Marsh itself, which&nbsp;extends
                north of New Romney, is protected by a seawall of&nbsp;great thickness, and its
                guardianship and drainage is in the&nbsp;hands of a special ancient corporation. The
                level affords&nbsp;pasturage for vast flocks of sheep. New Romney, which is
                now&nbsp;over a mile from the sea, has large sheep fairs, but little
                other&nbsp;trade. Of the five churches mentioned here in the Domesday&nbsp;Survey
                only one remains, but this, dedicated to St Nicholas, is&nbsp;a rich Norman building
                with later additions. Its Norman west&nbsp;tower is among the finest in England, and
                it has a beautiful&nbsp;Decorated east window with reticulated tracery. New
                Romney,&nbsp;the name of which distinguishes it from the decayed village of&nbsp;Old
                Romney, 2 m. W., is governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and&nbsp;twelve councillors.

        <p><span class="font1">Its fine harbour was the cause of the early importance of Romney
                (Romenal, Romenhall). The annual assembly of the&nbsp;Cinque Ports, called the
                Brodhull, was held here owing to its&nbsp;central position. At the time of Domesday
                the archbishop of&nbsp;Canterbury and the bishop of Bayeux were joint lords.
                Romney&nbsp;also owed maritime service to the king, which consisted of supplying
                five ships to serve for fifteen days in the year. A confirmation of liberties was
                granted by John in 1205. The town,&nbsp;which was a borough by prescription, was
                governed “ from time&nbsp;immemorial ” by twelve jurats; a bailiff was appointed by
                the&nbsp;archbishop, but the rights of the overlord seem to have been&nbsp;small,
                and in 1521 the inhabitants denied the bailiff the right&nbsp;of presiding with the
                jurats over their court. Elizabeth changed&nbsp;the style of incorporation to the
                mayor, jurats and commonalty,&nbsp;and another charter was granted by James II. in
                1686, which&nbsp;remained the governing charter until 1835. The Cinque
                Ports&nbsp;were first summoned to parliament in 1265; the first returns&nbsp;for
                Romney are for 1266; it returned two members until it was&nbsp;disfranchised in
                1832.</span></p>

                6836; commune, 8374.&nbsp;The town is situated on the Sauldre at its confluence

                and some old houses are the chief objects of interest.&nbsp;The remains of a château
                rebuilt by Francis I. in the&nbsp;Renaissance style are used as the sub-prefecture.
                Tribunals&nbsp;of first instance and of commerce, and a communal college
                are&nbsp;among the public institutions. The manufacture of flannel and&nbsp;cloth
                especially for army clothing is carried on, together with&nbsp;trade in wine, live
                stock, agricultural produce and the asparagus&nbsp;of the vicinity.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In 1560 Romorantin gave its name to an edict which prevented the
                introduction of the Inquisition into France.&nbsp;The industrial importance of the
                town dates from the later&nbsp;middle ages.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">ROMSDAL, the valley of the river Rauma, in Norway. The Rauma is a
                torrent descending from Lake Lesjekogen to the&nbsp;Romsdal Fjord on the west coast
                (62° 30' N.). The nearest&nbsp;port is Molde, from which steamers run to
                Veblungsnaes (30 m.)&nbsp;at the foot of the valley. A good road traverses the
                valley,&nbsp;which is one of the finest in southern Norway, flanked by
                steep&nbsp;mountains terminating in abrupt peaks—Vengetinder (5960
                ft.),&nbsp;Romsdalshom (5105), Troldtinder (“ witch-peaks,” 6010) and&nbsp;others.
                Several waterfalls are seen, such as the Mongefos, the&nbsp;Vaermofos, falling
                nearly 1000 ft., and the Slettafos. Lake&nbsp;Lesjekogen also drains from the
                opposite end by the Laagen&nbsp;or Lougen river to the Glommen, and so to the
                Skagerrack, and&nbsp;the road follows its valley, the Gudbrandsdal. The
                Romsdal&nbsp;gives its name to an </span><span class="font1"

        <p><span class="font1">ROMSEY, a market town and municipal borough in the New Forest
                parliamentary division of Hampshire, England,&nbsp;7 m. N.W. of Southampton by the
                London &amp; South-Western&nbsp;railway. Pop. (1901) 4365. It is pleasantly situated
                in the&nbsp;rich valley of the Test. The abbey church of SS. Mary and&nbsp;Elfleda
                is one of the finest examples in England of a great&nbsp;Norman church little
                altered by later builders. Its history&nbsp;is not clear, but a house was founded
                here by Edward the&nbsp;elder </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >(c.</span><span class="font1"> 910), and became a Benedictine nunnery.
                The&nbsp;church, which is the only important relic of the foundation,
                is&nbsp;cruciform, with a low central tower. Building evidently began&nbsp;in the
                first half of the 12th century, and continued through it,&nbsp;as the western part
                of the nave shows the transition to the&nbsp;Early English style, which appears very
                finely in the west&nbsp;front. Decorated windows occur in the east end,
                beyond&nbsp;which a chapel in this style formerly extended.
                Perpendicular&nbsp;insertions are insignificant. The nave and choir have
                aisles,&nbsp;triforium and clerestory. The transepts have eastern
                apsidal&nbsp;chapels, as have the choir aisles, though the walls of these
                last&nbsp;are square without. Foundations of the apse of a large pre-Norman church
                have been discovered below the present building. In Romsey there are tanyards,
                ironworks and works of&nbsp;the Berthon Boat Company. The borough is under a
                mayor,&nbsp;4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area, 533 acres.</span></p>

                its early importance, to the abbey. At the time of the&nbsp;Domesday
                Survey it ^as owned by the abbey, which continued&nbsp;to be the overlord until the
                dissolution. There is no evidence&nbsp;to show that Romsey was a borough before the
                charter of&nbsp;incorporation granted by James I. in 1608. This was confirmed by
                William III. in 1692, and the corporation was reformed&nbsp;in 1835. Romsey has
                never been represented in parliament.&nbsp;The right to hold a fair was granted to
                the abbey by Henry III.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all" /><div></div><br
