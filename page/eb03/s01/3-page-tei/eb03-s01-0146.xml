Even II the nephew of Finnan, who ſucceeded Gillus, is ſaid to have built the towns of Innerlochy and Inverneſs. He overcame Belus king of the Orkneys, who had invaded Scotland; and was ſucceeded by his ſon Eder, in whole time Julius Caeſar invaded the ſouthern parts of this iſland. Eder is laid to have aſſiſted the Britons againſt the common enemy. He was ſucceeded, after a reign of 48 years, by his ſon Even III. who is repreſented as a monſter of cruelty and luſt. Not content with having 100 noble concubines of his own, he made a law that a man might marry as many wives as he could maintain; and that the king ſhould have the firſt night with every noble bride, and the nobles the like with the daughters of their tenants. Nor was he leſs remarkable for his cruelty and rapaciouſneſs, which at laſt occaſioned a rebellion; and Even was dethroned, impriſoned, and put to death.</p><p>We meet with nothing memorable in the hiſtory of Scotland ſrom this time to that of Agricola, excepting that the famous Caractacus, who was carried priſoner to Rome, is ſaid to have been one of the Scottiſh monarchs; which, however, ſeems not very probable, as the Romans in his time had not penetrated near ſo far as Scotland. The invaſion of Agricola happened during the reign of Corbred, called by the Roman hiſtorians <hi rend="italic">Galgacus.</hi> Agricola having completed the conqueſt of the ſouthern parts, and in a great meaſure civilized the inhabitants, formed a like plan with regard to Scotland. It is probable, that at this time the Caledonians or Scots were rendered more formidable than ever they had been, by the acceſſion of great numbers from the ſouth; for though the Romans had civilized the greateſt part, it cannot be doubted that many of thoſe ſavage warriors, diſdaining the pleaſures of a peaceable life, would retire to the northward, where the martial diſpoſition of the Scots would better ſuit their inclination. The utmoſt efforts of valour, however, were not proof againſt the diſcipline of the Roman troops, and the experience of their commander. In the third year Agricola had penetrated as far as the river Tay; but the particulars of his progreſs are not recorded. The following year he built a line of forts between the friths of Forth and Clyde, to exclude the Caledonians from the ſouthern parts of the iſland; and the year after, he ſubdued thoſe parts which lay to the ſouth and weſt of his forts, namely, the counties of Galloway, Cantyre, and Argyle, which at that time were inhabited by a people called <hi rend="italic">Gangi, </hi>though ſome historians place theſe as far ſouth as Cheſhire in England, and the north part of Wales. This ſuppoſition, however, can ſcarcely be admitted, when we conſider that Tacitus expreſsly informs us, that the people whom Agricola conquered had never before been known to the Romans</p><p>Agricola ſtill purſued the ſame prudent meaſures by which he had already ſecured the poffeſſion of ſuch a large tract of country, that is, advancing but ſlowly, and building forts as he advanced, in order to keep the people in obedience. The Scots, though commanded</p><p>by their king, who is ſaid to have been well acquainted with the manner of fighting and diſcipline of the Romans, were yet obliged to retreat; but at laſt, finding that the enemy made ſuch progreſs as endangered the ſubjugation of the whole country, he reſolved to cut off their communication with the ſouthern parts, and likewiſe to prevent all poſſibility of a retreat by ſea. Agricola, though ſolicited by ſome of his officers, refuted to retreat; but divided his troops into three bodies, having a communication with each other. Upon this, Galgacus reſolved to attack the weakeſt of the three, which conſiſted only of the ninth legion, and lay at that time, as is ſaid, at a place called <hi rend="italic">Lockore,</hi> about two miles from Loch-Leven in Fife. The attack was made in the night: and as the Romans were both unprepared and inferior in number, the Scots penetrated into the heart of their camp, and were making a great ſlaughter, when Agricola detached ſome light-armed troops to their aſſiſtance; by whom the Caledonians in their turn were routed, and forced to fly to the marſhes and inacceſſible places, where the enemy could not follow them.</p><p>This engagement has been magnified by the Roman hiſtorians into a victory, though it can ſcarce be admitted from the teſtimonies of other hiſtorians. The Romans, however, certainly advanced very conſiderably, and the Scots as conſtantly retreated, till they came to the foot of the Grampian mountains, where the Caledonians reſolved to make their laſt ſtand. In the eighth year of the war, Agricola advanced to the foot of the mountains, where he found the enemy ready to receive him. Tacitus has given us a ſpeech of Galgacus, which he has undoubtedly fabricated for him, in which he ſets forth the aſpiring difpoſition of the Romans, and encourages his countrymen to defend themſelves vigorouſly, as knowing that every thing valuable was at ſtake. A deſperate engagement accordingly enſued. In the beginning, the Britons had the advantage, by the dexterous management of their bucklers: but Agricola having ordered three Tungrian and two Batavian cohorts, armed with ſhort ſwords, and emboſſed bucklers terminating in a point, to attack the Scots, who were armed with long ſwords, the latter soon found theſe weapons uſeleſs in a cloſe encounter; and as their bucklers only covered a small part of their bodies, they were eaſily cut in pieces by their adverſaries. The most forward of their cavalry and charioteers fell back upon their infantry, and diſordered the centre; but, the Britons endeavouring to out flank their enemies, the Roman general oppoſed them with his horſe; and the Caledonians were at laſt routed with great ſlaughter, and forced to fly into the woods, whither the Romans purſued with ſo little caution, that numbers of them were cut off Agricola, however, having odered his troops to proceed more regularly, prevented the Scots from attacking and cutting off his men in separate parties, as they had expected; ſo that this victory proved the greateſt ſtroke to the Caledonians that they had hitherto received This battle is ſuppoſed by ſome to have been fought in Strathern, half a mile ſouth from the kirk of Comrie; but others imagine the place to have been near Fortingal- Gamp, a place ſomewhat farther on the other ſide of the Tay.</p><p>Great as this victory was, it ſeems not to have been</p></body></text></TEI>
