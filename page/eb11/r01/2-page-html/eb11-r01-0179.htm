<p><span class="font2">year (27 Hen. VIII. c. 16) enacted that all bargains and sales of land should be duly enrolled. Bargain and sale was a form of&nbsp;equitable transfer which had for some purposes superseded the&nbsp;common law feoffment. It applied only to estates of inheritance&nbsp;and not to terms of years. The unforeseen effect of 27 Hen. VIII.&nbsp;c. 16 was to establish as the ordinary form of conveyance until&nbsp;1841 the conveyance by lease and release.@@<sup>1</sup> Uses having become&nbsp;legal estate by the Statute of Uses, and therefore no longer&nbsp;devisable, 32 Hen. VIII. c. 1 (explained by 34 &amp; 35 Hen. VIII.&nbsp;c. 5) was passed to remedy this inconvenience. It is still law&nbsp;as to wills made before 1838 (see Will). In the reign of&nbsp;Elizabeth the acts of 13 Eliz. c. 5 and 27 Eliz. c. 4 avoided&nbsp;fraudulent conveyances as against all parties and voluntary&nbsp;conveyances as against subsequent purchasers for valuable&nbsp;consideration. Early in the reign of Charles II. the act of 1661&nbsp;(12 Car. II. c. 24) turned all the feudal tenures (with the exception&nbsp;of frankalmoign and grand serjeanty) into tenure by free and&nbsp;common socage and abolished the feudal incidents. The Statute&nbsp;of Frauds (29 Car. II. c. 3) contained provisions that certain&nbsp;leases and assignments, and that all agreements and trusts&nbsp;relating to land, should be in writing (see Fraud). The land&nbsp;registries of Middlesex and Yorkshire date from the reign of&nbsp;Anne (see Land Registration). Devises of land for charitable&nbsp;purposes were forbidden by the Mortmain Act (9 Geo. II. c. 36).&nbsp;In the next reign the first general Inclosure Act was passed,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">41 </span><span class="font2">Geo. III. c. 109 (see Commons). In the reign of William IV.&nbsp;were passed the Prescription, Limitation and Tithe Commutation Acts; fines and recoveries were abolished and simpler&nbsp;modes of conveyance substituted by 3 &amp; 4 Will. IV. c. 74; and&nbsp;the laws of inheritance and dower were amended by 3 &amp; 4 Will.&nbsp;IV. cc. 105, 106. In the reign of Victoria there was a vast mass&nbsp;of legislation dealing with real estate in almost every conceivable&nbsp;aspect. At the immediate beginning of the reign stands the&nbsp;Wills Act. The transfer of real estate was simplified by 8 &amp; 9&nbsp;Vict. c. 106 and by the Conveyancing Acts of 1881 and 1882.&nbsp;Additional powers of dealing with settled estates were given by&nbsp;the Settled Estates Act 1856, later by the Settled Estates Act&nbsp;1877, and the Settled Land Act 1882. Succession duty was&nbsp;levied for the first time on freeholds in 1853. The strictness of&nbsp;the Mortmain Act has been relaxed in favour of gifts and sales&nbsp;to public institutions of various kinds, such as schools, parks&nbsp;and museums. The period of limitation was shortened for&nbsp;most purposes from twenty to twelve years by the Real Property&nbsp;Limitation Act 1874. Several acts were passed dealing with&nbsp;the enfranchisement and commutation of copyholds and the&nbsp;preservation of commons and open spaces. The Naturalization&nbsp;Act 1870 enahled aliens to hold and transfer land in England.&nbsp;The Felony Act 1870, abolished forfeiture of real estate on&nbsp;conviction for felony. The Agricultural Holdings Acts 1883&nbsp;and 1900, and other acts, gave the tenant of a tenancy within&nbsp;the acts a general right to compensation for improvements,&nbsp;substituted a year’s notice to quit for the six months’ notice&nbsp;previously necessary, enlarged the tenant’s right to fixtures,&nbsp;and limited the amount of distress. By the Intestate Estates&nbsp;Act 1884 the law of escheat was extended to incorporeal hereditaments and equitable estates. Among other subjects which&nbsp;have been dealt with by legislation in the 19th century may&nbsp;be mentioned land transfer, registration, mortgage, partition,&nbsp;excambion, fixtures, taking of land in execution, declaration of&nbsp;title and apportionment. Hardly a year passes in which the&nbsp;land law is not altered to a greater or less degree.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Real estate at the present day is cither legal or equitable, a difference resting mainly upon historical grounds. The following&nbsp;observations apply in general to both kinds of estate. The usual&nbsp;classification </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">interests in real estate regards either the extent,&nbsp;the time or the mode of enjoyment. The division according&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">extent</span><span class="font1"> is in the first instance into corporeal and incorporeal&nbsp;hereditaments, a division based upon the Roman law division of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res</span><span class="font1"> into </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">corporales</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">incorporales</span><span class="font1">, and open to the same objection,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">that it is unscientific as co-ordinating subjects of rights with the rights themselves.@@2 Corporeal hereditaments, says Blackstone,&nbsp;“ consist of such as affect the senses, such as may be seen and&nbsp;handled by the body; incorporeal are not the objects of sensation,&nbsp;can neither be seen nor handled, are creatures of the mind, and&nbsp;exist only in contemplation.” Corporeal hereditaments are all&nbsp;necessarily freehold;@@<sup>3</sup> an interest in land less than freehold, such&nbsp;as a term of years, is personalty only. There was no room for such&nbsp;an interest in the feudal gradation of tenure; it was regarded as a mere personal contract and was incapable of the incidents of tenure.&nbsp;By the Conveyancing Act 1881 the residue of a long term of years&nbsp;could in certain cases be enlarged into the fee-simple. A copyhold&nbsp;is in strict law only a tenancy at the will of the </span><span class="font0">lord. </span><span class="font1">Estates ot&nbsp;freehold are either estates for life or in fee (called also estates of&nbsp;inheritance), the latter being in fee-tail or in fee-simple. An&nbsp;estate for life may be either for the life of the tenant or for the&nbsp;life of another person, the latter called an estate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pur autre vie.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;former kind of estate includes estates of dower and curtesy. An&nbsp;estate in fee is called a fee simply, an obvious sign of its feudal&nbsp;origin. Estates tail are either general or special, the latter being&nbsp;in tail male or (rarely) in tail female. There may also be a quasi-entail of an estate </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pur autre vie.</span><span class="font1"> An estate in fee-simple is the&nbsp;largest estate known to English law. Its ordinary incidents are&nbsp;an oath of fealty (never exacted), escheat, and (in a manor) suit of the court baron, and occasionally a small quit-rent and relief. All&nbsp;these are obviously relics of the once important feudal incidents.&nbsp;Incorporeal hereditaments consist chiefly, if not wholly, of rights&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in alieno solo.</span><span class="font1"> They are divided by Joshua Williams (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Real Property,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">pt. ii.) into (1) reversions, remainders and executory interests,&nbsp;(2) hereditaments purely incorporeal, the last being either appendant,&nbsp;appurtenant or in gross. Examples are profits </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a prendre</span><span class="font1"> (such as&nbsp;rights of common), easements (such as rights of way),@@<sup>4</sup> seigniories,&nbsp;advowsons, rents, tithes, titles of honour, offices, franchises.&nbsp;Before 1845 corporeal hereditaments were said to lie in livery,&nbsp;incorporeal in grant. But by the Real Property Act 1845 all&nbsp;corporeal hereditaments are, as regards the conveyance of the&nbsp;immediate freehold thereof, to be deemed to lie in grant as well&nbsp;as in liyery. With regard to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">time</span><span class="font1"> of enjoyment, estates are&nbsp;either in possession or in expectancy—that is, in reversion or&nbsp;remainder or executory interests (see Remainder). With regard&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">mode</span><span class="font1"> of enjoyment, estates are either joint, in common,&nbsp;in coparcenary or in severalty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Exceptional Tenures.—</span><span class="font1">It has been already stated that there are still to be found survivals of the old pre-Conquest customary&nbsp;law. They are found both in the tenure and in the conveyance&nbsp;of land. The only customs of which judicial notice is taken&nbsp;are gavelkind </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> and borough-English </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> Any other local&nbsp;customs, as in manors, must be proved by evidence. The tenures&nbsp;of frankalmoign and grand serjeanty were specially preserved&nbsp;by 12 Car. II. c. 24.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Title.</span><span class="font1">—This is the name given to the mode of acquisition of rights over real estate. Title may arise either by alienation,&nbsp;voluntary or involuntary, or by succession. Voluntary alienation&nbsp;is either </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter vivos</span><span class="font1"> or by will. The former branch is practically&nbsp;synonymous with conveyance, whether by way of sale, settlement,&nbsp;mortgage or otherwise. As a general rule alienation of real estate&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">inter vivos</span><span class="font1"> must be by deed since 8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. 106. Since that&nbsp;act a deed of grant has superseded the old forms of feoffment and&nbsp;lease and release. Considerable alterations in the direction of&nbsp;shortness and simplicity have been made in the law of transfer of&nbsp;real estate by the Conveyancing Acts 1881, 1882 and the Land&nbsp;Transfer Acts 1875 and 1897. The word “ grant ” ĩs no longer&nbsp;necessary for a conveyance, nor are the old words of limitation&nbsp;“ heirs” and “ heirs of the body.” It is sufficient to use the words&nbsp;“ in fee-simple,” “ in tail,” “ in tail male,” “ in tail female.”&nbsp;Many provisions usually inserted in deeds, such as covenants for&nbsp;title by a beneficial owner and powers of appointment of new&nbsp;trustees, obtain statutory sanction. Forms of mortgage, conveyance and settlement are appended to the act. The Solicitors'&nbsp;Remuneration Act 1881 was passed as a necessary sequel to the&nbsp;Conveyancing Act, and the remuneration of solicitors now stands&nbsp;upon a different and more satisfactory basis. For acquisition by&nbsp;will and succession, see Will; Inheritance. lnvoluntary alienation is by bankruptcy </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> and by other means of enforcing the&nbsp;rights of creditors over land, such as distress or execution. It&nbsp;may also arise by the exercise by the state of its right of eminent&nbsp;domain for public purposes, as under the Lands Clauses and other&nbsp;acts.@@<sup>5</sup></span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> From the reign of Edward IV. at latest up to the Fines and Recoveries Act of 1833 fines and recoveries were also recognized as&nbsp;a means of conveyance. They are so regarded in the Statute of&nbsp;Uses.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@2</sup> In spite of this objection the division is adopted by the legislature ; see, for instance, the Intestate Estates Act 1884.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@3</sup> In the category of corporeal hereditaments are also included certain accessories to corporeal hereditaments proper, such as&nbsp;growing crops, fixtures, title-deeds, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@4</sup> It should be noticed that an easement in gross cannot exist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@5</sup> The right of the state to contribution from land for revenue purposes and to stamp duties on deeds perhaps falls under this&nbsp;head. These imposts are really involuntary alienations of part&nbsp;of the profit of the land.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
