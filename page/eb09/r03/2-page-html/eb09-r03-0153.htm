        <p><span class="font1">The typical church was a simple rectangular building, with or without
                aisles, having a large apse at the west end, and at the east&nbsp;three doors
                opening from a cloister-like atrium ;@@<sup>1</sup> when space was&nbsp;limited
                three sides of the atrium were omitted, leaving only a long&nbsp;pillared narthex or
                porch which extended along the whole width&nbsp;of the nave. The apse or
                presbyteriuιn, which was raised above&nbsp;the nave, contained a central marble
                throne for the celebrant and&nbsp;a long bench for the rest of the clergy. The high
                altar stood a&nbsp;little forward from the apse ; and over it was a square canopy
                or&nbsp;baldacchino supported on four marble columns ; each of the four&nbsp;arches
                of the canopy had a curtain, which was drawn close during&nbsp;the consecration of
                the elements ; at other times these curtains&nbsp;were twisted round the four
                columns of the baldacchino. The&nbsp;celebrant stood with his back to the apse,
                looking eastwards towards&nbsp;the people over the altar.@@<sup>2</sup> The high
                altar stood over the tomb of&nbsp;some saint or confessor, hence called the
                “confessio”; this was so&nbsp;arranged as to be at least partly visible, and usually
                was reached by&nbsp;a few steps descending from the nave. In later times the
                confessio&nbsp;became frequently a spacious crypt containing a small altar of
                its&nbsp;own. At this point cancelli or marble screens ran across the&nbsp;whole
                width of the church, both nave and aisles ; and hence the&nbsp;part thus railed off
                was called the “chancel.” The choir occupied&nbsp;most of the western half of the
                nave, and was raised one step above&nbsp;it ; it was completely surrounded by a low
                marble wall or screen,&nbsp;along two sides of which a marble bench was fixed. On
                the right@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>was the gospel ambo, its marble book-rest usually
                distinguished by&nbsp;a sculptured eagle, and beside it the tall paschal
                candlestick. On&nbsp;the left was the epistle ambo.@@<sup>4</sup> The font was
                frequently an ancient&nbsp;marble or porphyry bath, as in the Lateran baptistery and
                that of&nbsp;S. Maria Maggiore ; but in early times an ordinary parish
                church&nbsp;had no font ; baptisms were only performed in one or two of
                the&nbsp;great basilicas, and then in a separate building, usually octagonal&nbsp;in
                shape. In the centre of the open atrium stood a fountain for&nbsp;ablutions
                performed before entering the church, as in an Oriental&nbsp;mosque.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The walls of these early churches were mostly built of concrete,
                faced with brick, left structurally quite plain, and decorated only&nbsp;with
                painted stucco or glass mosaics,—especially (internally) in&nbsp;the apse and on the
                face of its arch, and (externally) on the east&nbsp;or entrance wall, the top of
                which was often built in an overhanging curve to keep off the rain. The windows were
                plain, with&nbsp;semicircular arches, and were filled with pierced marble screens,
                or&nbsp;in some cases with slabs of translucent alabaster· ; the latter was&nbsp;the
                case at S. Lorenzo fuori Ie Mura, and examples of the former&nbsp;still exist in the
                very early church formed in the rooms of some&nbsp;tliermæ on the Esquiline
                (possibly those of Trajan), below the 6th-century church of S. Martino ai Monti.
                Almost the only bit of&nbsp;external architectural ornament was the eaves cornice,
                frequently&nbsp;(as at the last-named church) formed of marble cornices stolen
                from&nbsp;earlier classical buildings. Internally the nave columns, with
                their&nbsp;capitals and bases, were usually taken from some classical
                building,&nbsp;and some churches are perfect museums of fine sculptured caps
                and&nbsp;rich marble shafts of every material and design.@@<sup>5</sup> At first the
                nave&nbsp;had no arches, the columns supporting a horizontal entablature, as&nbsp;at
                S. Clemente, S. Maria Maggiore, and S. Maria in Trastevere,&nbsp;but afterwards, in
                order to widen the intercolumniation, simple&nbsp;round arches of narrow span were
                introduced, thus requiring fewer&nbsp;columns. The roof was of the simple tie-beam
                and kingpost construction, left open, but decorated with painting or metal
                plates.&nbsp;The floor was paved either with coarse mosaic of large tesseræ
                (as&nbsp;at S. Pudentiana) or with slabs of marble stripped from
                ancient&nbsp;buildings. A later development of this plan added a small
                apse&nbsp;containing an altar at the end of each aisle, as in S. Maria in Cos-medin
                and S. Pietro in Vincoli.@@<sup>6</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The type of church above described was used as a model for by far the
                majority of early churches not only in Rome but also in&nbsp;England, France,
                Germany, and other Western countries. Another&nbsp;form was, however, occasionally
                used in Rome, which appears to&nbsp;have been derived from the round temple of pagan
                times. This is&nbsp;a circular building usually domed and surrounded with one or
                more&nbsp;rings of pillared aisles. To this class belong the combined
                church&nbsp;and mausoleum of Costanza (see fig. 27) and that of SS.
                Marcellinus&nbsp;and Petrus, both built by Constantine, the former to hold the tomb
                of&nbsp;his daughters Constantia and Helena, the latter that of his
                mother&nbsp;Helena. The latter is on the Via Labicana, about 2 miles
            outside</span></p>

                and important churches in Rome which are built on the&nbsp;above-described plan. The

        <p><span class="font1">Though the apses and classical columns of the naves in these churches
                were built at the dates indicated, yet in many cases it is&nbsp;difficult to trace
                the existence of the ancient walls ; the alterations&nbsp;and additions of many
                centuries have frequently almost wholly&nbsp;concealed the original structure. With
                the exception of S. Clemente,&nbsp;the early choir, placed as shown in fig. 26, has
                invariably been&nbsp;destroyed ; the side walls have often been broken through by
                the&nbsp;addition of rows of chapels ; and the whole church, both within&nbsp;and
                without, has been overlaid with the most incongruous architectural features in
                stucco or stone. The open roof is usually concealed either by a wooden panelled
                ceiling or by a stucco vault.&nbsp;The throne@@<sup>9</sup> and marble benches in
                the apse have usually given&nbsp;place to more modern wooden fittings, to suit the
                later position of&nbsp;the choir, which has always been transferred from the nave to
                the&nbsp;apse. In many cases the mosaics of the apse and the columns of&nbsp;the
                nave are the only visible remains of the once simple and stately&nbsp;original
                    church.@@<sup>10</sup></span></p>

        <p><span class="font1">The IOth and Ilth centuries in Rome were extraordinarily barren in
                the production of all branches of the fine arts, even that of architecture ; and it
                was not till the end of the 12th that any important&nbsp;revival began. The 13th
                century was, however, one of great artistic&nbsp;activity, when an immense number of
                beautiful works, especially&nbsp;in marble enriched with mosaic, were produced in
                Rome. This&nbsp;revival, though on different lines, was very similar to the
                rather&nbsp;later one which took place at Pisa (see Pisano), and, like
                that,&nbsp;was mainly due to the great artistic talents of one

                Incoronati, which also possesses the triforium galleries, like those of S. Agnese

                later) of the celebrant standing&nbsp;between the altar and the people necessitated
