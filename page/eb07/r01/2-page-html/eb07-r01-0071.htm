<p><span class="font0">soldiers on foreign service, when they happened to bear tiιe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">runs des vaches</span><span class="font0"> performed, were so overpowered by its effect as to be rendered incapable of attending to their duty.&nbsp;We know a British officer in the army who witnessed a remarkable instance of this effect in the military band attached to an English regiment. In Rogers’ Pleasures of Memory there is an elegant allusion made to the nostalgia or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">home-sickness</span><span class="font0"> produced by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vans des vaches</span><span class="font0"> upon Swiss&nbsp;soldiers in foreign lands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RANSOM, a sum of money paid for the redemption of a slave, or the liberty of a prisoner of war. In our lawbooks, ransom also means a sum paid for the pardon of&nbsp;some great offence, and to obtain the offender’s liberty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RANTAMPORE, a fortress of Hindustan, and the capital of a district of the same name, in the province of Ajmeer, and in the middle of the Arrabarne Hills. It is said to&nbsp;have been built in the thirteenth century, and is esteemed&nbsp;one of the largest and strongest fortresses in India ; but as&nbsp;it has never been visited by any Europeans, its strength is&nbsp;not accurately known. The travelling distance is 120 miles&nbsp;south-west from Agra, and 260 miles from Oojain. Long.&nbsp;76. 25. E. Lat. 26. 2. N.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAPE, in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Law,</span><span class="font0"> the carnal knowledge of a woman forcibly and against her will. This, by the Jewish law, was punished with death, in case the damsel was betrothed to&nbsp;another man ; and in case she was not betrothed, then a&nbsp;heavy fine of fifty shekels was to be paid to the damsel’s&nbsp;father, and she was to be the wife of the ravisher all the&nbsp;days of his life, without that power of divorce which was&nbsp;in general permitted by the Mosaic law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Roman law punishes with death and confiscation of goods the crime of ravishment, under which it includes&nbsp;both the offence of forcible abduction, or taking away a&nbsp;woman from her friends, and also the present one of forcibly dishonouring her ; either of which, without the other,&nbsp;is in that law sufficient to constitute a capital crime. The&nbsp;stealing away a woman from her parents or guardians, and&nbsp;debauching her, is equally penal by the emperor’s edict,&nbsp;whether she consent or be forced ; and this in order to take&nbsp;away every opportunity of offending in this way from women, whom the Roman law supposes never to go astray&nbsp;without the seduction and arts of the other sex ; and therefore, by restraining and making so highly penal the solicitations of the men, they meant to secure effectually the&nbsp;honour of the women. But our English law does not entertain quite such sublime ideas of the honour of either&nbsp;sex, as to lay the blame of a mutual fault upon one of the&nbsp;transgressors only ; and therefore it is a necessary ingredient in the crime of rape, that it must be against the&nbsp;woman’s will.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rape was punished by the Saxon laws, particularly those of Athelstane, with death ; which was also agreeable to the&nbsp;old Gothic or Scandinavian constitution. But this was afterwards thought too hard ; and in its stead another severe&nbsp;but not capital punishment was inflicted by William the&nbsp;Conqueror, namely, castration and loss of eyes, which continued till after Bracton wrote, in the reign of Henry III. But&nbsp;in order to prevent malicious accusations, it was then the&nbsp;law (and, it seems, still continues to be so in appeals of&nbsp;rape), that the woman should, immediately afterwards, go&nbsp;to the next town, and there make discovery to some credible persons, of the injury she had suffered, and afterwards&nbsp;should acquaint the high constable of the hundred, the coroners, and the sheriff, with the outrage. This seems to&nbsp;correspond in some degree with the laws of Scotland and&nbsp;Aragon, which require that complaint must be made within&nbsp;twenty-four hours ; though afterwards, by statute Westra.&nbsp;1, c. 13, the time of limitation in England was extended to&nbsp;forty days. At present there is no time of limitation fixed ;&nbsp;for, as it is usually now punished by indictment at the suit&nbsp;of the king, the maxim of law takes place, that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nullum tern-</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pus occurrit régi ;</span><span class="font0"> but the jury will rarely give credit to </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">stale complaint. During the former period also it was held&nbsp;for law, that the woman, by consent of the judge and her&nbsp;parents, might redeem the offender from the execution of&nbsp;his sentence, by accepting him for her husband ; if he also&nbsp;was willing to agree to the exchange, but not otherwise&nbsp;In the 3d Edward I. by the statute Westm. 1, c. 13, the&nbsp;punishment of rape was much mitigated ; the offence itself,&nbsp;of ravishing a damsel within age, that is, twelve years old,&nbsp;either with or without her consent, or of any other woman&nbsp;against her will, being reduced to trespass, if not prosecuted by appeal within forty days, and subjecting the offender only to two years’ imprisonment, and a fine at the king’s&nbsp;will. But this lenity being productive of the worst consequences, it was, in ten years afterwards, 13 Edward I., found&nbsp;necessary to make the offence of forcible rape felony by&nbsp;statute Westm. 2, c. 34. And by statute 18 Elizabeth, c.&nbsp;7, it is made felony without benefit of clergy ; as is also the&nbsp;abominable wickedness of carnally knowing or abusing any&nbsp;woman-child under the age of ten years, in which case the&nbsp;consent or non-consent is immaterial, as by reason of her&nbsp;tender years she is incapable of judgment and discretion.&nbsp;Sir Matthew Hale is indeed of opinion that Buch profligate&nbsp;actions committed on an infant under the age of twelve&nbsp;years, the age of female discretion by the common law,&nbsp;either with or without consent, amount to rape and felony,&nbsp;as well since as before the statute of Queen Elizabeth. But&nbsp;that law has in general been held only to extend to infants&nbsp;under ten ; though it should seem that damsels between&nbsp;ten and twelve are still under the protection of the statute&nbsp;Westm. 1, the law with respect to their seduction not having been altered by either of the subsequent statutes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A male infant, under the age of fourteen years, is presumed by law to be incapable of committing a rape, and therefore, it seems, cannot be found guilty of it. For though&nbsp;in other felonies </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">malitia supplet œtatem ;</span><span class="font0"> yet, as to this particular species of felony, the law supposes an imbecility of&nbsp;body as well as mind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The civil law seems to suppose a prostitute or common harlot incapable of any injuries of this kind ; not allowing&nbsp;any punishment for violating the chastity of her who has&nbsp;indeed no chastity at all, or at least has no regard to it.&nbsp;But the law of England does not judge so hardly of offenders, as to cut off all opportunity of retreat even from common strumpets, and to treat them as incapable of amendment. It therefore holds it to be felony to force even a concubine or harlot, because the woman may have forsaken that&nbsp;unlawful course of life ; for, as Bracton well observes, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">licet&nbsp;meretrix fuerit antea, certe tunc temporis non fuit, cum reclamando nequitia ejus Conserdire noluit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RAPHAEL, or Raffaelle, d’Urbino, the greatest, most sublime, and most excellent painter that has appeared since the revival of the fine arts, was the son of an indifferent painter named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sanzio,</span><span class="font0"> and was born at Urbino on&nbsp;Good Friday 1482. The popes Julius II. and Leo X., who&nbsp;employed him, loaded him with wealth and honour ; and it&nbsp;is said that Cardinal de St Bibiana had such a value for him&nbsp;that he offered him his niece in marriage. His genius is&nbsp;admired in all his pictures ; his contours are free, his designs correct, his figures elegant, his expressions lively, his&nbsp;attitudes natural, his heads graceful ; in fine, everything&nbsp;is grand, beautiful, just, natural, and adorned with grace.&nbsp;These various perfections he derived not only from his excellent abilities, but from his study of antiquity and anatomy,&nbsp;and from the friendship which he contracted with Ariosto,&nbsp;who contributed not a little to the improvement of his taste.&nbsp;His pictures are to be found principally in Italy and in Paris.&nbsp;That of the Transfiguration, preserved at Rome in the church&nbsp;of St Peter Monterio, passes for his masterpiece. Raphael&nbsp;had a handsome person, was well proportioned, and had great&nbsp;sweetness of temper ; he was polite, affable, and modest.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
