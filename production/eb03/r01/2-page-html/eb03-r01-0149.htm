<p><span class="font3">proportion to the depth under the ſurface. For 57 : 73r=32 : 41 very nearly. He therefore eſtimates the&nbsp;non-preffure to be of the height of the water above&nbsp;the orifice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">we are difpoſed to think that the ingenious author has not reaſoned accurately from the experiment. In&nbsp;the firſt place, the force indicated by the experiment,&nbsp;whatever be its origin, is certainly double of what he&nbsp;fuppofes ; for it muſt be meaſured by the ſum of the&nbsp;riſe of the water in one leg, and its depreſſion in the&nbsp;«ther, the weight of the air in the bend of the ſyphon&nbsp;being neglected. It is preciſely analogous to the force&nbsp;acting on the water oſeillatmg in a fyphon, which is&nbsp;acknowledged to be the ſum of the elevation and de-preſſion. The force indicated by the experiment therefore is </span><span class="font0">∙i-⅛⅜ </span><span class="font3">θf the height of the water above the orifice. The force exhibited in this experiment bears a&nbsp;ſtill greater proportion to the productive height ; ſor&nbsp;it is certain that the water </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">did not</span><span class="font3"> iffue with the velo--*'city acquired by the fall from the ſurface, and probably did not exceed -J oſ it. The effect of contraction&nbsp;muſt have been confiderable and uncertain. The velocity ſhould have been meaſured both by the amplitude&nbsp;of the jet and by the quantity oſ water diſcharged. In&nbsp;the next place, we apprehend that much oſ the effect&nbsp;is produced by the tenacity oſ the water, which drags&nbsp;along with it the water which would have ſlowly iffued&nbsp;from the fyphon, had the other end not dipped into&nbsp;the water of the veffel. </span><span class="font1">we </span><span class="font3">know, that if the hori-zontal part of the ſyphon had been continued far&nbsp;enough, and if no retardation were occafioned by fric-tion, the column of water in the upright leg would have&nbsp;accelerated like any heavy body ; and when the laft of&nbsp;it had arrived at the bottom of that leg, the whole in&nbsp;the horizontal part would be moving with the velocity&nbsp;acquiredby falling from the ſurface. The water of the vef-ſel which iiΓues through the ſurrounding ring very quickly acquires a much greater velocity than what the water&nbsp;deſcending in the ſyphon would acquire in the ſame time,&nbsp;and it drags this laſt water along with it both by tenacity&nbsp;and friction, and it drags it out till its action is oppoſed&nbsp;by the want of equilibrium produced in the ſyphon, by&nbsp;the elevation in the one leg and the depreſſion in the&nbsp;other. We imagine that little can be concluded from&nbsp;the experiment with reſpect to the real non-preffure.&nbsp;Nay, if the ſides of the ſyphon be ſuppoſed infinitely&nbsp;thin, ſo that there would be no curvature of the fila-ments of the ſurrounding water at the mouth of the&nbsp;ſyphon, we do not very diſtinctly fee any fouree of non-preffure : For we are not altogether fatisfièd with the&nbsp;proof which Mr Buat offers for this meaſure of the&nbsp;preffure of a ffream of fluid gliding along a ſurface, </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">and&nbsp;οbβructed by friction or any other caufe.·</span><span class="font3"> we imagine that&nbsp;the paſſing water in the preſent experiment would be a&nbsp;little retarded by accelerating continually the water de-ſcending in the ſyphon, and renewed a-top, ſuppofing&nbsp;tlie upper end open; becauſe this water would not of it-ſelf acquire more than half this velocity. It however&nbsp;drags it out, till it not only refiſts with a force equal to&nbsp;the weight of the whole vertical column, but even ex-ceeds it by <sub>τ</sub>⅛⅛∙. This it is able to do, becauſe the&nbsp;whole preffure by which the water iffues from an orifice&nbsp;has been ſhown (by Daniel Bernoulli) to be equal to&nbsp;twice this weight, we therefore confider this beauti-</span><span class="font1">Sil experiment </span><span class="font3">as </span><span class="font1">chiefly </span><span class="font3">valuable, </span><span class="font1">by </span><span class="font3">giving us a </span><span class="font1">mea-</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">ſure of the tenacity of the water; and we wiſh that it were repeated in a variety of depths, in order to diſco-ver what relation the force exerted bears to the depth.&nbsp;It would ſeem that the tenacity, being a certain deter-minate thing, the proportion of 100 to 112 would not&nbsp;be conſtant; and that the obſerved ratio would be made&nbsp;up of two parts, one of them conſtant, and the other&nbsp;proportional to the depth under the ſurface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">But ſtill this experiment is intimately connected with the matter in hand ; and this apparent non-preſ-ſure'on the hinder part of a body expofed to a ſtream,&nbsp;from whatever cauſes it proceeds, does operate in the&nbsp;action of water on this hinder part, and mult be taken&nbsp;into the account.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">_ we muſt therefore follow the Chevalier de Buat in his diſcuſſions on this ſubject. A priſmatic body, ha-ving its prow and poop equal and parallel ſurfaces,. and&nbsp;plunged horizontally into a fluid, will require a force&nbsp;to keep it firm in the direction of its axis preciſely equal&nbsp;to the difference between the real preffures exerted on&nbsp;its prow and poop. If the fluid is at reſt, this difference will be nothing, becauſe the oppofite dead preffures of the fluid will be equal : but in a ſtream, there&nbsp;is ſuperadded to the dead preffure on the prow the active preffure ariſing from the deflections of the filaments-of this fluid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">If the dead preffure on the poop remained in its full intenſity by the perfect ſtagnation of the water be-hind it, the whole fenſible preffure on the body would&nbsp;be the active preffure only on the prow, repreſented by&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">m h.</span><span class="font3"> If, on the other hand, we could ſuppoſe that the&nbsp;water behind the body moved continually away from it&nbsp;( being renewed laterally ) with the velocity of the ftream,&nbsp;the dead preffure would be entirely removed from its&nbsp;poop, and the whole ſenfible preffure, or what muff be&nbsp;oppoſed by ſome external force, would be </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">m h</span><span class="font3"> -j- </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">h.&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">Neither of theſe can happen ; and the real ſtate of the&nbsp;caſe muſt be between thefo extremes.·</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The following experiments were tried : The perfo-rated box with its vertical tube was expofed to the ſtream, the braſs plate being turned down the ſtream.&nbsp;The velocity was again 36 inches per ſecond.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The central hole A alone being opened, gave a non-preffure of _ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1<sub>3</sub> lines..</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A hole B, ⅜ of an inch from the </span><span class="font1">edge; </span><span class="font3">gave&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A hole C, near the ſurfaee &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>5&gt;7</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A hole D, at the lower angle - </span><span class="font1">1y,j</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Here it appears that there is a very confiderable non-preffure, increafing from the centre to the border..&nbsp;This increaſe undoubtedly-proceeds from the greater la-teral velocity with which the water is gliding in from&nbsp;the ſides. The water behind was by no means ſtag-nant, although moving off with a much fmaller velocity&nbsp;than that of the paſſing ſtream, and it was viſtbly removed from the fides, and gradually licked away at its&nbsp;further extremity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another box, having a great number of holes, all open, indicated a medium off non-preffure equal to 13,i&nbsp;lines.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">A nother of larger dimenfions, </span><span class="font1">but </span><span class="font3">having </span><span class="font1">fewer holes, </span><span class="font3">indicated a non-preffure of 12⅛.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h3><span class="font1">But the moſt remarkable,, and the moſt important phenomena, were the following :</span></h3><a name="caption2"></a><h2><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The ſirſt box wa<sub>l</sub>s fixed to the ſide of another box,</span></h2><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
