<p><span class="font1">20 miles, and the greatest breadth from east to west about 16 miles. The area is 94,889 acres, or about 148 square&nbsp;miles. The surface is pleasantly undulating, ridges of high&nbsp;ground running east and west, separated by rich and luxuriant valleys, generally about half a mile in breadth. The&nbsp;principal valley is that of Catmoss to the south of Oakham,&nbsp;having to the north of it a tract of table-land commanding&nbsp;an extensive prospect into Leicestershire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Welland, which is navigable to Stamford, flows north-east, forming the greater part of the boundary of&nbsp;the county with Northamptonshire. The Gwash or Wash,&nbsp;which rises in Leicestershire, flows eastwards through the&nbsp;centre of the county, and just beyond its borders, enters&nbsp;the Welland in Lincolnshire. The Chater, also rising in&nbsp;Leicestershire and flowing eastwards enters the Welland&nbsp;about two miles from Stamford. The Eye flows south-eastwards along the borders of Leicestershire. The county&nbsp;belongs almost entirely to the Jurassic formation, consisting of Liassic and Oolitic strata—the harder strata, chiefly&nbsp;limestone containing iron, forming the hills and escarpments, and the clay-beds the slopes of the valleys. The&nbsp;oldest rocks are those belonging to the Lower Lias in the&nbsp;north-west. The bottom of the vale of Catmoss is formed&nbsp;of marlstone rock belonging to the Middle Lias, and its&nbsp;sides are composed of long slopes of Upper Lias clay. The&nbsp;Upper Lias also covers a large area in the west of the&nbsp;county. The lowest series of the Oolitic formation is the&nbsp;Northampton sands bordering Northamptonshire. The&nbsp;Lincolnshire Oolitic limestone prevails in the east of the&nbsp;county north of Stamford. It is largely quarried for&nbsp;building purposes, the quarry at Ketton being famous&nbsp;beyond the boundaries of the county. The Great Oolite&nbsp;prevails towards the south-east. Formerly the iron was&nbsp;largely dug and smelted by means of the wood in the&nbsp;extensive forests, and the industry is again reviving.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Agriculture.—</span><span class="font0">In the eastern and south-eastern districts the soil is light and shallow. In the other districts it consists chiefly of&nbsp;a tenacious but fertile loam, and in the fertile vale of Catmoss&nbsp;the soil is either clay or loam, or a mixture of the two. The&nbsp;prevailing redness, which colours even the streams, is owing to&nbsp;the ferruginous limestone carried down from the slopes of the hills.&nbsp;The name of the county is by some authorities derived from this&nbsp;characteristic of the soil, but the explanation is doubtful. The&nbsp;eastern portions of the county are chiefly under tillage and the&nbsp;western in grass. Out of 94,889 acres no fewer than 86,477 acres&nbsp;in 1885 were under cultivation, corn crops occupying 22,820 acres,&nbsp;green crops 7520 acres, rotation grasses 6553 acres, and permanent&nbsp;pasture 47,816 acres. Over 3000 acres were under woodland.&nbsp;The principal corn crop is barley, which occupied 9484 acres, but&nbsp;wheat and oats are also largely grown. Turnips and swedes occupy&nbsp;about five-sixths of the area under green crops. The rearing of&nbsp;sheep and cattle occupies the chief attention of the farmer. Large&nbsp;quantities of cheese are manufactured and sold as Stilton. Cattle,&nbsp;principally shorthorns, numbered 19,810, of which 3054 were cows&nbsp;and heifers in milk and in calf. Sheep—Leicesters and South&nbsp;Downs—numbered 80,881, horses 3062, pigs 3054, and poultry&nbsp;27,376. According to the parliamentary return of 1873 the number&nbsp;of proprietors was 1425, of whom 861 possessed less than one acre.&nbsp;The largest proprietors were the earl of Gainsborough 15,076,&nbsp;Lord Aveland 13,634, marquis of Exeter 10,713, and George H.&nbsp;Finch 9182.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Railways.—</span><span class="font0">The main line of the Great Northern intersects the north-eastern corner of the county, and branches of that system, of&nbsp;the London and North-Western, and of the Midland connect it&nbsp;with all parts of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Administration and Population.—</span><span class="font0">Rutland comprises five hundreds and contains fifty-seven civil parishes, and part of the parish of Stoke-Dry, which extends into Leicestershire. Formerly represented by two members of parliament, since 1885 it returns one&nbsp;only. There is no municipal or parliamentary borough. The&nbsp;county has one court of quarter sessions, but is not subdivided for&nbsp;petty sessional purposes. Ecclesiastically it is entirely in the&nbsp;diocese of Peterborough. The population was 21,861 in 1861,&nbsp;22,073 in 1871, and 21,434 in 1881. The average number of persons to an acre in 1881 was 0 23, and of acres to a person 4<sup>-</sup>43.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History and Antiquities.—</span><span class="font0">In the time of the Romans the district now included in Rutlandshire was probably inhabited by&nbsp;the Coritani, and was included in Flavia Cæsariensis. Ennyn</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Street traversed it in the north-east, and there was an important station at Great Casterton. As a shire it is later than Domesday,&nbsp;when a portion of it was included in Northamptonshire but the&nbsp;greater part in Nottingham. It is referred to as com. Roteland&nbsp;in the fifth year of King Johu, in the document assigning a dowry&nbsp;to Queen Isabella, but for a long time previous to this the name&nbsp;Roteland was applied to Oakham and the country round it.&nbsp;Edward, eldest son of Edmund of Langley, fifth son of Edward III.,&nbsp;was created earl of Rutland, but the title became extinct in the&nbsp;royal house when Edward earl of Rutland was stabbed to death at&nbsp;the battle of Clilford. In 1525 the title was revived in the person&nbsp;of Lord Ros, and the tenth earl was created duke in 1703. At&nbsp;the battle of Stamford in 1470 Lancaster was defeated by Edward&nbsp;IV. The only old castle of which there are important remains is&nbsp;Oakham, dating from the time of Henry IL, and remarkable for&nbsp;its Norman hall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUTLAND, a township and village of the United States, capital of Rutland county, Vermont, 117 miles north-north-west of Boston. It is an important railway junction,&nbsp;being the terminus of several minor lines and the seat of&nbsp;machine-shops and engine-houses; but its name is even&nbsp;better known through its quarries of white marble. The&nbsp;population of the township was 12,149 and that of the&nbsp;village 7502 in 1880.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Chartered by New Hampshire in 1761 and again chartered as Socialborough in 1772 by New York, Rutland became in 1775&nbsp;a fortified post on the great northern military road, and in 1781&nbsp;was made the chief town of Rutland county. Between 1784 and&nbsp;1804 it was one of the capitals of the State.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUYSBROECK, or Ruysbroek, John, mystic, was born at Ruysbroek, near Brussels, about 1293, and died as&nbsp;first prior of the convent of Groenendael, near Waterloo, in&nbsp;1381. See Mysticism, vol. xvii. p. 133.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUYSCH, Frederik (1638-1731), anatomist, was born at The Hague in 1638, and died at Amsterdam on&nbsp;February 22, 1731. See Anatomy, vol. i. p. 812.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RUYSDAEL, or Ruisdaal, Jacob (c. 1625-1682), the most celebrated of the Dutch landscapists, was born&nbsp;at Haarlem about 1625. The accounts of his life are&nbsp;very conflicting, and recent criticism and research have&nbsp;discredited much that was previously received as fact&nbsp;regarding his career. He appears to have studied under&nbsp;his father Izaac Ruysdael, a landscape-painter, though&nbsp;other authorities make him the pupil of Berghem and of&nbsp;Albert van Everdingen. The earliest date that appears&nbsp;on his paintings and etchings is 1645. Three years later&nbsp;he was admitted a member of the guild of St Luke in&nbsp;Haarlem; in 1659 he obtained the freedom of the city of&nbsp;Amsterdam, and we know that he was resident there in&nbsp;1668, for in that year his name appears as a witness to&nbsp;the marriage of Hobbema. During his lifetime his works&nbsp;were little appreciated, and he seems to have suffered from&nbsp;poverty. In 1681 the sect of the Mennonites, with whom&nbsp;he was connected, petitioned the council of Haarlem for&nbsp;his admission into the almshouse of the town, and there&nbsp;the artist died on the 14th of March 1682.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The works of Ruysdael may be studied in the Louvre and the National Gallery, London, and in the collections at The Hague,&nbsp;Amsterdam, Berlin, and Dresden. His favourite subjects are&nbsp;simple woodland scenes, similar to those of Everdingeu and&nbsp;Hobbema, or views of picturesque mills and cottages, or of ruined&nbsp;towers and temples, set upon broken ground, beside streams or&nbsp;waterfalls. He is especially noted as a painter of trees, and his&nbsp;rendering of foliage, particularly of oak leafage, is characterized&nbsp;by the greatest spirit and precision. His views of distant cities,&nbsp;such as that of Haarlem in the possession of the marquis of Bute,&nbsp;and that of Katwijk in the Glasgow Corporation Galleries, clearly&nbsp;indicate the influence of Rembrandt. He frequently paints coast-scenes, and sea-pieces with breaking waves and stormy skies filled&nbsp;with wind-driven clouds, but it is in his rendering of lonely&nbsp;forest glades that we find him at his best. The subjects of certain&nbsp;of his mountain scenes, with bold rocks, waterfalls, and fir-trees,&nbsp;seem to be taken from Norway, and have led to the supposition&nbsp;that he had travelled in that country. We have, however, no&nbsp;record of such a journey, and the works in question are probably&nbsp;merely adaptations from the landscapes of Van Everdingen, whose&nbsp;manner he copied at one period. Only a single architectural sub</span></p>
