See Algebra, Arithmetic, and Equations.</p><p>ROPE, a general name for all kinds of cordage, but more correctly applied to such as is above one inch in circumference, the smaller sorts being distinguished by the names of twines, cords, and lines.</p><p>The art of twisting into lines and ropes various materials, such as thongs of animal hide, the hairs of animals, ∣ough grasses, and vegetable fibres, is of remote antiquity, and has existed even among the rudest people.</p><p>The tarabita or rope-bridge of the Peruvians, and the lasso of the Chilian hunter, are formed by twisting together thongs of ox's hide ; and in our own country at the present day ropes for particular purposes are made of horse’s hair. The coir-ropes of Ceylon and the Maldive islands are made from the fibrous husk of the cocoa-nut ; the Manilla rope from the fibres of a species of the wild banana, the <hi rend="italic">Musa textilis ;</hi>  and the <hi rend="italic">Sunn</hi>  ropes from those of the <hi rend="italic">Crotolariajuncea.</hi></p><p>Many other vegetables have fibres of great tenacity, and fitted for the purposes of the rope-maker ; but preference is given to those of the <hi rend="italic">Cannabis sativa,</hi>  or cultivated hemp, and the <hi rend="italic">Linum usitatissimum,</hi>  or flax, the fibres of both of which possess in a remarkable degree the essential qualities of flexibility and tenacity. Some idea of the importance of the manufacture under consideration may be obtained from the fact that, in the year ending January 1839, the value of the hemp alone imported into Great Britain and Ireland was L.617,597, and the value of the cordage exported was L.94,639.</p><p>The fibres of the hemp are first twisted together to form a thread or yarn. Many yarns are then combined by twisting, and form a strand ; three strands are in like manner combined, and form what is properly a rope, and technically termed a shroud-laid rope or hawser-laid rope ; and three of these ropes may be again combined, forming what is termed a cable-laid rope. The fibres should be so arranged that each in the finished rope shall offer the greatest resistance to its being torn asunder in the direction of its length.</p><p>If we take a bundle of fibres, equal in length and strength, and fasten it at the ends, each fibre will, upon a strain being applied to the bundle, bear its proper share of the stress ; and the strength of the bundle will evidently be measured by adding together the strength of the separate fibres. But if we twist this bundle so as to form a thread, the strain will no longer be equally distributed among the fibres ; for, by the torsion, the external fibres of the bundle will be wound round those that lie nearest to the centre, and, in proportion to their distance from the heart of the bundle, and the amount of twist given, will form spirals more or less inclined from the axis of the thread. The external fibres will in consequence be longer than tile internal ones, and the greatest share of the strain will be borne by the latter. Further, by the operation of twisting, the fibres in a thread are strained, and, on account of their position, the external ones the most. It is of importance to consider the proper length of the primary fibres, and the degree of torsion that ought to be given in forming them into a thread.</p><p>All threads require the fibres to be so fine, and of such a length, that the quantity of fibres used, and the number of turns each has round its axis, shall be so great as to produce the necessary compression amongst them, to prevent them from sliding upon each other. If the thread be small, the fibres must be fine, and may be short ; and if the thread be large, then must the fibres be long. If the fibres be long in proportion to the size of thread to be made from them, less twisting will obviously be necessary to keep them from sliding ; and the finer and softer the fibres are, the more may the twist be diminished ; for soft fibres enter into closer combination with each other than those that are hard. Long fibres requiring thus less twist than short ones, it has been a standing rule with all theoretical writers, that fibres should always be spun into the thread endlong, and never by their bight or double. Now, in the practice of hand-spinning, the fibres are always spun into the thread by their bights, and never by their ends.</p><p>It is certainly an advantage in threads which are to be used merely as such, to secure as great a length of fibre as possible, as any strain tends directly to pull the fibres asunder ; and they are retained in their position merely by the compression among the co-fibres, produced by twisting.</p><p>But many threads are combined in forming strands ; new forces are brought into action, and so at every further combination. This will be better explained by the following diagram. Let <hi rend="italic">αa</hi>  be the primary fibres, formed into threads <hi rend="italic">b ;</hi>  in each thread the fibres are retained in their position by the compression produced by twisting. Let <hi rend="italic">bb</hi>  be threads twisted together to form a strand. Here the threads mutually compress each other, and the primary fibres of each thread are compressed by the surrounding threads. Let <hi rend="italic">cc</hi>  be strands twisted to form a hawser-laid rope. In this the compression on the primary fibres is again increased, and so in the next combination, where the three hawser-laid ropes are twisted into the cable-rope <hi rend="italic">d.</hi></p><p>We may from this deduce, that it is not the length so much as the intrinsic strength of the fibre which fits it for the purpose of the rope-maker ; and practice perfectly fixes this position, the ropes made from the short waste fibre of the hemp called tow being by no means so weak when compared with those made from the hemp itself, as theory would lead us to suppose, seeing that these fibres are the shortest and weakest of the material. It may therefore be laid down as a rule, that in the making of ropes it is of greater consequence that the fibres should be strong, soft, and finely hackled, than that they should be of great length.</p><p>Let us consider a little more how the twist of the thread is affected by its future combination. The fibres are first twisted in a certain direction to form threads. A collection of these threads is then twisted together to form a strand ; and this last twist being in a direction contrary to that of the threads, untwists them to a certain extent.</p><p>Had the twist in the first instance been no more than would just have kept the fibres from sliding upon each other, it would now be inadequate to produce that effect. Hence one would think it necessary to provide means to put more twist into the threads as they were being formed into strands, or to put as much more twist into the threads while spinning, as the twisting of the strands abstracts from them ; but when these strands are combined to form a hawser-laid rope, the direction of the twist is again the same as that of the threads, and restores to them a certain portion of what they had lost. If, however, three of these hawser-laid ropes are formed into a cable-laid rope, the threads are</p></body></text></TEI>
