                <p><label>RTHE</label> twentieth letter in the Phoenician alphabet, the nineteenth
                    in the numerical Greek, the seventeenth in the ordinary Greek and the Latin and
                    (owing to the addition of J) the eighteenth in the English. Its earliest form in
                    the Phoenician alphabet when written from right to left was █, thus resembling
                    the symbol for D with one side of the triangle prolonged. In Aramaic and other
                    Semitic scripts which were modified by opening the heads of the letters, the
                    symbol in time became very much changed. Greek, however, maintained the original
                    form with slight variations from place to place. Not infrequently in the Greek
                    alphabets of Asia Minor and occasionally also in the West, R was written as D,
                    thus introducing a confusion with D (q. v. ). Elsewhere a short tail was added,
                    as occasionally in the island of Melos, in Attica and in western Greece, but
                    nowhere does this seem to have been universal. The earliest Latin forms are
                    exactly like the Greek. Thus in the very early inscriptions found in the Forum
                    in 1899 R appears as █ (from right to left), p and D (from left to right). Later
                    the forms R and R come in; sometimes the back is not quite connected in the
                    middle to the upright, when the form R is produced. The name of the Semitic
                    symbol is Rēsh; why it was called by the Greeks Rho (ῥῶ) is not clear. The h
                    which accompanies r in the transliteration of Greek p, indicates that it was
                    breathed, not voiced, in pronunciation. No consonant varies more in
                    pronunciation than r. According to Brockelmann, the original Semitic r was
                    probably a trilled <hi rend="italic">r</hi> , <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi> an
                        <hi rend="italic">r</hi> produced by allowing the tip of the tongue to
                    vibrate behind the teeth while the upper surface of the tongue is pressed
                    against the sockets of the teeth. The ordinary English r is also produced
                    against the sockets of the teeth, but without trilling; another r, also
                    untrilled, which is found in various parts of the south of England, is produced
                    by turning up the tip of the tongue behind the sockets of the teeth till the
                    tongue acquires something of a spoon shape. This, which is also common in the
                    languages of modern India, is called the cerebral or cacuminal r, the former
                    term, which has no meaning in this connexion, being only a bad translation of a
                    Sanscrit term. The common German r is produced by vibrations of the uvula at the
                    end of the soft palate, and hence is called the uvular r. There are also many
                    other varieties of this sound. In many languages r is able to form syllables by
                    itself, in the same way that l, m, n may do, as in the English brittle (britl),
                    written (ritn). In Europe r with this value is most conspicuous in Slavonic
                    languages like Bohemian (Czech) and Croatian; in English r in this function is
                    replaced by a genuine vowel in words like mother (moðð). This syllabic r is
                    first recorded for Sanscrit, where it is common, but is replaced in the
                    languages descended from Sanscrit by r and a vowel or by a vowel only, according
                    to the position in which it occurs. Most philologists are of opinion that
                    syllabic r existed also in the mother-tongue of the Indo-European languages. (P.
