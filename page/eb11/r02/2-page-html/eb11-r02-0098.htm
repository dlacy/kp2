        <p><span class="font2">J. G. Repsold introduced essential improvements in the meridian
                circles by substituting microscopes (on Jesse Ramsden’s plan) for&nbsp;the verniers
                to read the circles, and by making the various parts&nbsp;perfectly symmetrical. For
                a number of years the firm furnished&nbsp;meridian circles to the observatories at
                Hamburg, Königsberg, Pulkova, &amp;c.; later on its activity declined, while
                Pistor&nbsp;and Martins of Berlin rose to eminence. But after the discontinuance of
                this firm that of Repsold again came to the front, not&nbsp;only in the construction
                of transit circles, but also of equatorial&nbsp;mountings and more especially of
                fieliometers (see Micrometer) .</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">REPTILES (Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"

                > to creep; Gr. epTretP, whence the term “herpetology,”&nbsp;for the science dealing
                with them). In the days before Linnaeus,&nbsp;writers comprised the animals which
                popularly are known as&nbsp;tortoises and turtles, crocodiles, lizards and snakes,
                frogs and&nbsp;toads, newts and salamanders, under the name of
                oviparous&nbsp;quadrupeds or four-limbed animals which lay eggs.
                Linnaeus,&nbsp;desirous of giving expression to the extraordinary fact that
                many&nbsp;of these animals pass part of their life in the water and part
                        on&nbsp;land,@@<sup>1</sup>
                substituted the name of Amphibia for the ancient term.&nbsp;Subsequent French
                naturalists (Lyonnet@@<sup>2</sup> and Brisson@@<sup>3</sup>) considered that the
                creeping mode of locomotion was a more general&nbsp;characteristic of the class than
                their amphibious habits, and&nbsp;consequently proposed the scarcely more
                appropriate name of&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;"
                >Reptiles,</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">As naturalists gradually comprehended the wide gap existing between
                frogs, toads, &amp;c., on the one hand, and the other&nbsp;oviparous quadrupeds on
                the other, they either adopted the&nbsp;name of Batrachia for the former and that of
                Amphibia for the&nbsp;latter, or they restricted the term Amphibia to
                Batrachians,&nbsp;calling the remainder of these creatures reptiles. Thus the
                term&nbsp;Amphibia, as used by various authors, may apply (1) to all
                the&nbsp;various animals mentioned, or (2) to Batrachians only (see&nbsp;Batrachia).
                The term Reptiles (Reptilia) is used (1) by some&nbsp;for all the animals mentioned
                above, and (2) by others, as in the&nbsp;present article, for the same assemblage of
                animals after the&nbsp;exclusion of Batrachians.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Equally varying are the limits of the term Saurians, which occurs so
                frequently in every scientific treatise on this&nbsp;subject. At first it comprised
                living crocodiles and lizards only,&nbsp;with which a number of fossil forms were
                gradually associated.&nbsp;As the characters and affinities of the latter became
                better&nbsp;known, some of them were withdrawn from the Saurians, and
                at&nbsp;present it is best to abandon the term altogether.</span></p><div>

        <p><span class="font2">work, however, was rather that of a comparative treatise of the
                anatomical and physiological characters of animals than their&nbsp;systematic
                arrangement and definition, and his ideas about the&nbsp;various groups of reptiles
                are not distinctly expressed, but must&nbsp;be gleaned from the terms which he
                employs. Moreover, he paid&nbsp;less attention to the study of reptiles than to that
                of other&nbsp;classes. This is probably due to the limited number of kinds&nbsp;he
                could be acquainted with, to which only very few extra-European forms, like the
                crocodile, were added from other&nbsp;sources. But while we find in some respects a
                most remarkable&nbsp;accuracy of knowledge, there is sufficient evidence that
                he&nbsp;neglected everyday opportunities of information. Thus, he has&nbsp;not a
                single word about the metamorphoses of Batrachians,&nbsp;which he treats of in
                connexion with reptiles.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">Aristotle makes a clear distinction between the scute or scale of a
                reptile, which he describes as φολ£$, and that of a fish, which&nbsp;he designates
                as Xeris. He mentions reptiles (1) as oviparous&nbsp;quadrupeds with scutes, viz.
                Saurians and Chelonians; (2) as&nbsp;oviparous apodals, viz. Snakes; (3) as
                oviparous quadrupeds&nbsp;without scutes, viz. Batrachians. He considered the first
                and&nbsp;second of these three groups as much more nearly related to each&nbsp;other
                than to the third. Accurate statements and descriptions&nbsp;are sadly mixed with
                errors and stories of, to our eyes, the most&nbsp;absurd and fabulous kind. The most
                complete accounts are&nbsp;those of the crocodile (chiefly borrowed from Herodotus)
                and of&nbsp;the chameleon, which Aristotle evidently knew from
                personal&nbsp;observation, and had dissected himself. The other lizards mentioned by
                him are the common lizards (σαύρα), the common&nbsp;seps (χαλ/ds </span><span

        <p><span class="font2">Passing over eighteen centuries, we find the knowledge of reptiles to
                have remained as stationary as other branches of&nbsp;natural history, perhaps even
                more so. The reptile fauna of&nbsp;Europe was not extensive enough to attract the
                energy of a&nbsp;Belorn or Rondelet; popular prejudice and the difficulty
                of&nbsp;preserving these animals deterred from their study; nor was
                man&nbsp;sufficiently educated not to give implicit credence to the
                fabulous&nbsp;tales of reptiles in the 15th and 16th centuries. The art
                of&nbsp;healing, however, was developing into a science based upon&nbsp;rational
                principles, and consequently not only those reptiles&nbsp;which formed part of the
                </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">materia medica</span><span
                class="font2"> but also the venomous&nbsp;snakes became objects of study to the
                physician, though the&nbsp;majority of the writers were ignorant of the structure of
                the&nbsp;venom-apparatus, and of the distinction between non-venomous&nbsp;and
