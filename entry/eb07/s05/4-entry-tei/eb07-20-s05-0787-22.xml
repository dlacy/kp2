a city of Spain, in the province of Valencia, and government of Alcira. It stands on the banks of the river Xucar, in a marshy soil, which, though not very favourable to health, is well adapted for the growth of rice, which is here cultivated to a great extent. In the town there is a church, with a monastery and a chapel ; and it contains 700 dwellings, with 4800 inhabitants.<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0935.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s05-0788"/>
