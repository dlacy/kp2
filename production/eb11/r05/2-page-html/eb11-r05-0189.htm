                Palestine </span><span class="font0">(151B.C.). </span><span class="font1">The
                finest examples are those of the walls&nbsp;of the temple at Jerusalem, and at
                Hebron, where the stones are&nbsp;of immense size and the rustication projects
                sometimes over a&nbsp;foot. The Crusaders’ castles in Palestine are all boldly
                rusticated, but the projecting portions have been worked over with a&nbsp;chisel in
                diagonal lines, and this enables them to be distinguished&nbsp;from the earlier
                masonry. In the five-sided tower at Nuremberg and the Burg-Capelle at Rothenburg,
                the rustication has a&nbsp;decorative value, so that in later work it was employed
                for the&nbsp;quoin-stones of towers. The masonry of the Palazzo Vecchio,&nbsp;and of
                the Pitti, Strozzi and Riccardi palaces, all in Florence,&nbsp;and of other palaces
                in Siena and Volterra, is rusticated.&nbsp;Rustication was employed in terraces and
                grottos in Italy,&nbsp;where on account of its extravagances it gave rise to the
                term&nbsp;“ grotesque.” In the later Renaissance the edges of the stone&nbsp;were
                bevelled off, with a sunk joint in addition; and the treatment&nbsp;was known as
                vermiculatcd, if in imitation of earth burrowed&nbsp;by worms; marine, if with small
                shell holes; stalactitic, if&nbsp;carved in imitation of lime deposits, &amp;c. In
                Italy the projecting&nbsp;portions were sometimes worked into facets. Rustication
                was&nbsp;introduced into England by Inigo Jones, who, in old Somerset&nbsp;House,
                York Stairs Watergate, the gateway of the Botanical&nbsp;Garden at Oxford, and
                elsewhere, used it only in alternate&nbsp;courses, his example being followed by
                other architects of the&nbsp;Renaissance. The term is now applied to the ashlar
                blocks of&nbsp;masonry which alternate with the circular drums of columns&nbsp;in
                many public buildings.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">RÜSTOW, FRIEDRICH WILHELM (1821-1878), Swiss soldier and military
                writer, was a Prussian by birth. He entered the&nbsp;service of his native country,
                and served for some years, until&nbsp;the publication of </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Der Deutsche Militärstaat vor und während&nbsp;der
                Revolution</span><span class="font1"> (Zürich, 1850) brought him official
                condemnation.&nbsp;He was sentenced by a court-martial to a long term of
                fortress&nbsp;imprisonment, but succeeded in escaping to Switzerland.
                He&nbsp;obtained military employment in the service of the Republic,&nbsp;and in
                1857 was major on the engineer staff. Three years&nbsp;later he accompanied
                Garibaldi in the famous expedition&nbsp;against the two Sicilies as colonel and
                chief of the staff, and&nbsp;to him must be ascribed the victories of Capua (19th
                Sept.&nbsp;i860) and the Voltumo (ist Oct. i860). At the end of the&nbsp;campaign he
                once more settled down at Zürich. At the outbreak of the war of 1870 he offered his
                services to Prussia,&nbsp;but was not accepted. In 1878, on the foundation of a
                military&nbsp;professorship at Zürich, Rüstow applied for the post, and, on
                its&nbsp;being given to another officer, lost heart and committed
            suicide.</span></p>

                bom in the first half of the 13th century. His name is&nbsp;nowhere mentioned by his
                contemporaries. He frequently&nbsp;plays in his verse on the word Rutebeuf, which
                was probably&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">nom de

                vein reveal&nbsp;that his own miserable circumstances were chiefly due to
                a&nbsp;love of play, particularly a game played with dice, which was&nbsp;known as

        <p><span class="font1">Rutebeuf’s serious work as a satirist probably dates from about 1260.
                His chief topics are the iniquities of the friars,&nbsp;and the defence of the
                secular clergy of the university of Paris&nbsp;against their encroachments; and he
                delivered a series of&nbsp;eloquent and insistent poems (1262, 1263, 1268, 1274)
                exhorting&nbsp;princes and people to take part in the crusades. He was
                a&nbsp;redoubtable champion of the university of Paris in its quarrel&nbsp;with the
                religious orders who were supported by Pope Alexander IV., and he boldly defended
                Guillaume de Saint-Amour&nbsp;when he was driven into exile. The libels, indecent
                songs and&nbsp;rhymes condemned by the pope to be burnt together with&nbsp;the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Périls des derniers
                temps</span><span class="font1"> attributed to Saint-Amour, were&nbsp;probably the
                work of Rutebeuf. The satire of </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">Renart le Bcs-tourné,</span><span class="font1"> which
                borrows from the Reynard cycle little but the&nbsp;names under which the characters
                are disguised, was directed,&nbsp;according to Paulin Paris, against Philip the
                Bold. To his&nbsp;later years belong his religious poems, and also the </span><span

                with the story-tellers&nbsp;of the middle ages. Rutebeuf can claim no priority in
                the&nbsp;choice of the subject, which had been treated dramatically in&nbsp;the
