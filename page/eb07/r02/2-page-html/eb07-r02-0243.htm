<p><span class="font0">it can produce by acting uniformly during a given time. This will be ascertained when we know the velocity impressed upon a body containing a given quantity of matter.&nbsp;Thus we know that terrestrial gravity acting on a body for&nbsp;a second, will cause it to fall sixteen feet with an uniformly&nbsp;accelerated motion, and will leave it in a state such that it&nbsp;would move on for ever at the rate of thirty-two feet per&nbsp;second. The force of gravity is therefore such as to communicate a velocity of thirty-two feet per second ; and in&nbsp;this case the mase of the body is not considered, for gravity&nbsp;acts equally on every particle of which it is composed. In&nbsp;the same manner, the best way of acquiring a distinct conception of the rotatory effect of a moving force, is to determine the quantity of rotatory motion which it can generate&nbsp;by acting uniformly during some known time.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If a solid body, or rigid system of invariable form, admit of a rotatory motion about an axis, and if at any point&nbsp;of the body a force P be applied, which acts in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation, and tends to turn the body&nbsp;in one direction ; and to any other point in the same plane&nbsp;a force Q be applied, tending to turn the body in the opposite direction ; then, if the two forces be to each other inversely as the distances of the lines of their directions respectively from the axis, the body will remain at rest, or the&nbsp;two forces will be in equilibrium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For let O (fig. 1) be the axis of rotation, and suppose the force P to be applied at the point P in the direction PA, and&nbsp;tending to turn the solid body about</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tlle axis O perpendicular to the plane</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the paper, and let the force Q act</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">in the direction QB, and consequent</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ly tend to turn the body in the oppo</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">site direction, and draw OA perpen</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">dicular to PA, and OB perpendicu</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">lar to QB. Then, in order that there</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">may be equilibrium, we must have,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">by the principle of the lever, P : Q : : OB : OA, whence P ∙ OA = Q ∙ OB.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is obviously indifferent at what point of the plane&nbsp;the force is applied, provided its distance from the axis remains the same· Let BO therefore be produced, and take&nbsp;OC equal to OA, and draw CR perpendicular to BC, or&nbsp;parallel to BQ. We may now suppose the force P to be&nbsp;replaced by an equal force R, acting in the direction RC ;&nbsp;then, since R ∙ OC = P ∙ O A, we have R ∙ OR = Q ∙ OB,&nbsp;and, consequently, the axis being supposed fixed, the body&nbsp;will remain in equilibrium between the two forces Qand R.&nbsp;These forces are therefore equivalent to a single force applied at O, equal to their sum, and acting in a parallel direction. Hence the resultant of two parallel forces applied&nbsp;to a straight line is a force parallel to the component forces,&nbsp;equal to their sum, and whose line of direction divides the&nbsp;straight line into parts reciprocally proportional to the forces&nbsp;themselves.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If two forces, which are inversely as the distances of&nbsp;their respective directions from the axis of rotation, be applied to a body, the equilibrium will still be</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">maintained, although the two forces are not in the same plane. Let OO' be two points&nbsp;in the axis of rotation, through which let&nbsp;there be drawn two planes </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aa</span><span class="font0"> and Βό at&nbsp;right angles to the axis. Suppose also these&nbsp;planes to be intersected by another plane&nbsp;(here supposed to be the plane of the figure)&nbsp;passing through the axis, and let OA, O'B&nbsp;be the intersections, and let the straight line&nbsp;which joins A and B intersect the axis in C. Let P and Q&nbsp;be two forces applied respectively at A and B in the planes&nbsp;A0α and BO⅛, and at right angles to O A and O'B, or perpendicular to the plane of the paper, then these two forces&nbsp;are parallel ; and because by hypothesis P : Q : ; O'B : OA,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0">we have P : Q : : CB : CA ; therefore (8) the two forces P and Q are equivalent to a single parallel force passing&nbsp;through C. But a force passing through the axis has no&nbsp;tendency to turn the body round the axis ; consequently&nbsp;the body remains at rest.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let wl, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m', m&quot;,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. (fig. 3) be a system of bodies immoveable in respect of each other, and suppose them to revolve about an axis passing through O ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">also let </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m, m', rn&quot;,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. denote the quanti</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">and let r, r', r&quot;, &amp;c. denote their dis</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">tances from the axis of rotation. Let the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">angular velocity of the system be </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">w ;</span><span class="font0"> then</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) the absolute velocities of the bodies</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">are respectively </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tor, tor', wr&quot;, &amp;c.</span><span class="font0"> Now</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">let us suppose the system to be put in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">motion by an external force F applied at the point P, in tlle direction PA, which is contained in a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation ; then the relation between the&nbsp;force F and the velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">w</span><span class="font0"> may be found as follows. Considering, first, the body </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m ;</span><span class="font0"> since its velocity = </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wr,</span><span class="font0"> and its&nbsp;quantity of matter = rn, its quantity of motion = </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wrm.</span><span class="font0"> But&nbsp;it is a principle in dynamics, that the quantity of motion of&nbsp;a moving body is proportional to the impressed force, and&nbsp;may be taken as a measure of that force ; whence </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wrm</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;the measure of a force which, if applied at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m,</span><span class="font0"> in a direction&nbsp;perpendicular to </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Om,</span><span class="font0"> would cause </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span class="font0"> to begin to move with&nbsp;the actual velocity </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tor.</span><span class="font0"> Let/be the force which, if applied&nbsp;at P in the direction PA, would make equilibrium with the&nbsp;force </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">wrm</span><span class="font0"> at </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m ;</span><span class="font0"> draw OA perpendicular to PA, and make&nbsp;OA = </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h.</span><span class="font0"> We have then (7)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">F =∕+∕+∕'+, &amp;c. we shall have the equation</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">F ∙ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h = w (f<sup>l</sup>m + r<sup>n</sup>m'</span><span class="font0"> + r<sup>,</sup>'<sup>i</sup>zw&quot; +, &amp;c.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we suppose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m = m' = m&quot;</span><span class="font0"> =, &amp;c. and take </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span class="font0"> to denote the distance of any particle from the axis of rotation, the&nbsp;equation becomes F ∙ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">h = wl</span><span class="font0"> (r<sup>2</sup>m) ; the summation denoted by </span><span class="font1">2 </span><span class="font0">extending to every particle in the system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the direction of the external force F is not in&nbsp;a plane parallel to the circles of rotation, it must be resolved&nbsp;into two forces, one of which lies in that plane, and the&nbsp;other is parallel to the axis. It is only the first of these&nbsp;forces which in the present case is regarded as the moving&nbsp;force ; the second merely tends to push tlle body in the&nbsp;direction of the axis, and does not influence the rotation.&nbsp;When we come to consider the rotation of a body perfectly free, it will be necessary to attend particularly to this&nbsp;circumstance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A solid body may be regarded as composed of molecules of a very small but finite magnitude, connected so as to&nbsp;form an invariable system ; and although a solid, according&nbsp;to his view of the constitution of body, is formed of discrete&nbsp;elements, the sums relative to the molecules may be changed&nbsp;into definite integrals without sensible error ; that is to say,&nbsp;for the sums 2r<sup>s</sup>m we may substitute the definite integrals&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">∕r<sup>2</sup>dm,</span><span class="font0"> where </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dm</span><span class="font0"> is the element of the mass, and the integrals extend to the whole mass.

<p><span class="font0">13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The energy of a force applied to a lever, or its power&nbsp;of producing motion round the fulcrum, is expressed by the&nbsp;product of the force into the perpendicular drawn from the&nbsp;fulcrum upon the line of its direction.
