<p><span class="font1">right arm. With unflinching pertinacity he struggled till he had completed a likeness of the king upon which he was&nbsp;engaged at the time, and then started for his beloved Italy,&nbsp;leaving behind him a series of fifty royal portraits to be completed by his assistant Reinagle. For several years he lingered&nbsp;in the south, his constitution finally broken. He died at&nbsp;Dover on the 10th of August 1784.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Among his most satisfactory productions are some of his earlier ones, such as the full-length of the duke of Argyll, and&nbsp;the numerous bust-portraits of Scottish gentlemen and their&nbsp;ladies which he executed before settling in London. They are&nbsp;full of both grace and individuality; the features show excellent&nbsp;draughtsmanship; and the flesh-painting is firm and sound in&nbsp;method, though frequently tending a little to hardness and&nbsp;opacity. His full-length of Lady Mary Coke is remarkable&nbsp;for the skill and delicacy with which the white satin drapery&nbsp;is managed; while in the portrait of his brown-eyed wife,&nbsp;the eldest daughter of Sir Alexander Lindsay of Evelick, in&nbsp;the Scottish National Gallery, we have a sweetness and tenderness which shows the painter at his highest. This last-named&nbsp;work shows the influence of French art, an influence which&nbsp;helped greatly to form the practice of Ramsay, and which&nbsp;is even more clearly visible in the large collection of his&nbsp;sketches in the possession of the Royal Scottish Academy&nbsp;and the Board of Trustees, Edinburgh.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSAY, SIR ANDREW CROMBIE (1814-1891), British geologist, was born at Glasgow on the 31st of January 1814,&nbsp;being the son of William Ramsay, manufacturing chemist.&nbsp;He was for a time actually engaged in business, but from spending his holidays in Arran he became interested in the study of&nbsp;the rocks of that island, and was thus led to acquire the rudiments of geology. A geological model of Arran, made by him&nbsp;on the scale of two inches to the mile, was exhibited at the&nbsp;meeting of the British Association at Glasgow in 1840, and&nbsp;attracted the notice of Sir R. I. Murchison, with the result that&nbsp;he received from De la Beche an appointment on the Geological&nbsp;Survey, on which he served for forty years, from 1841 to 1881.&nbsp;He was first stationed at Tenby, and to that circumstance may&nbsp;be attributed the fact that so much of his geological work dealt&nbsp;with Wales. His first book, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Geology of the Isle of Arran,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">was published in 1841. In 1845 he became local director for&nbsp;Great Britain, but he continued to carry on a certain amount&nbsp;of field-work until 1854. To the first volume of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs of&nbsp;the Geological Survey</span><span class="font1"> (1846) he contributed a now classic essay,&nbsp;“ On the Denudation of South Wales and the Adjacent Counties&nbsp;of England,’’ in which he advocated the power of the sea to form&nbsp;great plains of denudation, although at the time he under-estimated the influence of subaerial agents in sculpturing the&nbsp;scenery. In 1866 he published </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Geology of North Wales&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(vol. iii. of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Memoirs),</span><span class="font1"> of which a second edition was pub-lished in 1881. He was chosen professor of geology at Uni-versity College, London, in 1848, and afterwards lecturer in the&nbsp;same subject at the School of Mines in 1851. Eleven years&nbsp;later he was elected to the presidential chair of the Geological&nbsp;Society, and in 1872 he succeeded Murchison as director-general of the Geological Survey. In 1880 he acted as president&nbsp;of the British Association at Swansea, and in the following year&nbsp;retired from the public service, receiving at the same time the&nbsp;honour of knighthood. In i860 he published a little book&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Old Glaciers of Switzerland and North Wales.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;study of this subject led him to discuss the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Glacial Origin of&nbsp;Certain Lakes in Switzerland, the Black Forest,</span><span class="font1"> </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;c</span><span class="font1">. He dealt&nbsp;also with the origin of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Red Racks of England</span><span class="font1"> (1871) and&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Riυer Courses of England and Wales</span><span class="font1"> (1872). He was&nbsp;especially interested in tracing out the causes which have&nbsp;determined the physical configuration of a district, and he&nbsp;devoted much attention to the effects produced by ice, his&nbsp;name being identified with the hypothesis, which, however, has&nbsp;never commanded general assent, that in some cases lake basins&nbsp;have been scooped out by glaciers. A master in the broader&nbsp;questions of stratigraphy and physical geology, he was a clear&nbsp;exponent of facts, but rather impatient of details, while his&nbsp;original and often bold theories, expressed both in lectures and&nbsp;in writings, stirred others with enthusiasm and undoubtedly&nbsp;exercised great influence on the progress of geology. His&nbsp;lectures to working men, given in 1863 in the Museum of&nbsp;Practical Geology, formed the nucleus of his famous </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Physical&nbsp;Geology and Geography of Great Britain</span><span class="font1"> (5th ed., 1878; 6th ed.,&nbsp;by H. B. Woodward, 1894). He received a Royal medal in&nbsp;1880 from the Royal Society, of which he became a fellow in&nbsp;1862; he was also the recipient of the Neill prize of the Royal&nbsp;Society of Edinburgh in 1866, and of the λVollaston medal of&nbsp;the Geological Society of London in 1871. He died at Beaumaris on the 9th of December 1891.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAMSAY, ANDREW MICHAEL (1686-1743), French writer, of Scottish birth, commonly called the “ Chevalier Ramsay,” was&nbsp;born at Ayr on the 9th of January 1686. Ramsay served with&nbsp;the English auxiliaries in the Netherlands, and in 1710 visited&nbsp;Fénelon, who converted him to Roman Catholicism. He remained in France until 1724, when he was sent to Rome as tutor&nbsp;to the Stuart princes, Charles Edward and Henry, the future&nbsp;cardinal of York. He was driven by intrigue from this post,&nbsp;and returned to Paris. He was in England in 1730, and received&nbsp;an honorary degree from the university of Oxford. The claim&nbsp;was nominally his discipleship to Fénelon, but in reality beyond&nbsp;doubt his connexion with the Jacobite party. He died at&nbsp;St Germain-en-Laye (Seine-et-Oise) on the 6th of May 1743.&nbsp;Ramsay’s principal work was </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les voyages de Cyrus</span><span class="font1"> (London,&nbsp;1728; Paris, 1727), a book composed in avowed imitation of&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Télémaque.</span><span class="font1"> He also edited </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Télémaque</span><span class="font1"> itself (Paris, 2 vols., 1717)&nbsp;with an introduction, and wrote a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire de la vie et des outrages&nbsp;de Fénelon</span><span class="font1"> (The Hague, 1723), besides a partial biography&nbsp;(Paris, 1735) of Turenne, some poems (Edinburgh, 1728) in&nbsp;English, and other miscellaneous works.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSAY, DAVID (1749-1815), American physician and historian, the son of an Irish emigrant, was born in Lancaster&nbsp;county, Pennsylvania, on the 2nd of April 1749. He graduated&nbsp;at Princeton in 1765, and M.B. at the University of Pennsylvania in 1773, and then settled as a physician at Charleston,&nbsp;South Carolina, where he had a large practice. During the&nbsp;War of Independence he served as a field-surgeon (1780-1781),&nbsp;and from 1776 to 1783 he was a member of the South Carolina&nbsp;legislature. Having acted as one of the “ council of safety ”&nbsp;at Charleston, he was, on the capture of that city in 1780,&nbsp;seized by the British as a hostage, and for nearly a year was&nbsp;kept in confinement at St Augustine. From 1782 to 1786 he&nbsp;served in the Continental Congress, and from 1801 to 1815 in&nbsp;the state Senate, of which he was long president. In 1785 he&nbsp;published in two volumes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Revolution of South&nbsp;Carolina,</span><span class="font1"> in 1789 in two volumes </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the American Reυolution,</span><span class="font1"> in 1807 a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Life of Washington,</span><span class="font1"> and in 1809 in two volumes&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of South Carolina.</span><span class="font1"> He was also the author of several&nbsp;minor works. He died at Charleston on the 8th of May 1815&nbsp;from a wound inflicted by a lunatic. His </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">History of the United&nbsp;States</span><span class="font1"> in 3 vols. was published posthumously in 1816-1817,&nbsp;and forms the first three volumes of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Universal History&nbsp;Americanized,</span><span class="font1"> published in 12 vols. in 1819.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAMSAY, ROBERT (1842-1882), Australian statesman, was a native of Hawick, Roxburghshire, but his parents emigrated to&nbsp;Victoria when he was a child of four, and he was educated at the&nbsp;Scottish college in Melbourne. He studied law at Melbourne&nbsp;University, and subsequently became a member of a well-known&nbsp;firm of solicitors in the city. He married in 1868 Isabella&nbsp;Catherine Urquhart, and in 1870 entered the assembly for East&nbsp;Bourke in the Conservative and free trade interest. He was a&nbsp;member of the government of James Goodall Francis in 1872-74. He was subsequently postmaster-general (1874-75) in the administration of George Biscoe Kerferd; he held the same&nbsp;office in conjunction with the ministry of education (1875-77)&nbsp;under Sir James M'Culloch; and for a short term in 1880 he&nbsp;was chief secretary and minister of education in the first&nbsp;administration of James Service. He died on the 23rd of&nbsp;May 1882.</span></p>
