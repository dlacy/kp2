<p><span class="font2">and the grain bought there is sent to Berwick for exportation to London. Λ considerable proportion is also sent to Dalkeith, and paid for by ready money. The carts that attend the Dalkeith market, on their return bring back coals&nbsp;or lime, which abound in that quarter. Bone manure, which&nbsp;is now getting into general use, is principally procured from&nbsp;Berwick. If either of the railways projected for connecting&nbsp;Newcastle and Edinburgh be carried into effect, it will be&nbsp;of great advantage to the county.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The towns are Kelso, Jedburgh, Hawick, and Melrose; and of the villages the most considerable are Yetholm and&nbsp;Kirk-Yetholm, near its eastern boundary. For notices of the&nbsp;towns, the reader is referred to them under their alphabetical heads. The two Yetholms are worthy of notice for&nbsp;their fairs, at which a great part of the cattle, sheep, and&nbsp;wool of the county are sold ; and Kirk-Yetholm is remarkable for being the principal colony of gipsies in Scotland.&nbsp;At Jedburgh, Kelso, Melrose, and the village of Gatton-side, there are some valuable orchards, particularly at Jedburgh and Melrose, where some very old trees which belonged to their abbeys are still remarkably prolific.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This county, placed on the borders of the two kingdoms, which were constantly at war with each other, presents the&nbsp;ruins of a great many castles and towers, and other remains, of an early age. Amongst these may be mentioned&nbsp;the Castles of Hermitage in Liddesdale ; Cessford in Eckford&nbsp;parish ; Ferniehirst near Jedburgh ; Brankholm on the banks&nbsp;of the Teviot, several miles above Hawick; and Harden,&nbsp;situated in Borthwick Vale, a mile from Hawick, formerly&nbsp;the seat of the Scotts of Harden. The site where the important Castleof Jedburgh stood is now occupied by a prison.&nbsp;The celebrated Catrail, erected by the Britons under the Roman yoke, and also the Roman road, both cross this county.&nbsp;Their remains can be distinctly traced. The county was also&nbsp;distinguished for its religious buildings, for which we refer&nbsp;to the articles Jedburgh, Kelso, and Melrose. The ancient burgh and town of Iloxburghe, which at one time was&nbsp;the fourth town in Scotland in importance and population,&nbsp;was situated on the beautiful peninsula formed by the junction of the Tweed and the Teviot rivers. It was regularly&nbsp;fortified by walls and ditches ; and although it cannot be&nbsp;traced to a remoter period than the reign of Alexander I.,&nbsp;it is believed to have been a royal burgh before that time,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2">and, as such, governed by an alderman and inferior functionaries. It formed one of the court of four boroughs, which by the wisdom of David I. was instituted as a higher&nbsp;court, for hearing and deciding upon the appeals brought&nbsp;before them by the other royal burghs of the kingdom.&nbsp;Money was also coined here, and coins are yet to be seen&nbsp;in the depositories of antiquaries, of the date of William&nbsp;the Lion and James II. Situated as it was at the foot of one&nbsp;of the strongest castles on the border, it underwent many&nbsp;changes. It was several times burned by the English army,&nbsp;particularly in the years 1369 and 1460. This was the more&nbsp;easily accomplished from the buildings being almost entirely&nbsp;of wood ; and its restoration in a short time may be explained&nbsp;from the abundant supply of wood yielded by the forests&nbsp;which then covered the country. Its site has been partly used&nbsp;for centuries, and is still used, for holding the ancient fair of&nbsp;St James. During the summer of 1842, a considerable portion of the ancient foundations was uncovered by the plough.&nbsp;The castle of the same name was built on an eminence at the&nbsp;west end of the town. This eminence rises to the height&nbsp;of nearly forty feet above the level of the Teviot, which&nbsp;here runs at the south base of the castle. The waters of&nbsp;the river were made subservient to fill the deep fosse which&nbsp;surrounded the fortress on the west, north, and east sides,&nbsp;by means of a dam thrown obliquely across the stream.&nbsp;Only a few remains of what appear to be the outward defences are now standing, but by their thickness they attest&nbsp;its prodigious strength. The interior of the building is now&nbsp;so overgrown with tall trees, that it is impossible to give any&nbsp;idea of the formation of its defences within. What remains&nbsp;is most probably the foundations of the fort erected by the&nbsp;Earl of Somerset after his expedition into Scotland in the&nbsp;year 1547. But it is needless to enter into historical (acts&nbsp;connected with this fortress, as these will be given under the&nbsp;history of Scotland.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">There are various fairs held in the county. The most important are, St Boswell’s, held on the l8th of July, for cattle, sheep, horses, linen and woollen cloth ; and St James’s, held&nbsp;on the 5th of August, for nearly the same articles as at St&nbsp;Boswell’s. There are also fairs held at Melrose, Yetholm,&nbsp;Hawick, Jedburgh, &amp;c.</span></p>
