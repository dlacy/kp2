                <p><label>SAY, [JEAN BAPTISTE] LÉON</label> (1826-1896), French statesman and
                    economist, was born in Paris on the 6th of June 1826. The family was a most
                    remarkable one. His grandfather Jean Baptiste Say <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>
                    was a well-known economist. His brother Louis Auguste Say (1774-1840), director
                    of a sugar refinery at Nantes, wrote several books against his theories. His son
                    Horace Émile Say (1794-1860), the father of Léon Say, was educated at Geneva,
                    and had travelled in America before establishing himself in business in Paris,
                    where he became president of the Chamber of Commerce in 1848. His careful
                    investigations into the condition of industry at Paris gained for him a seat in
                    the Academy of political and moral sciences, 1857.</p>
                <p>Léon Say thus inherited zeal for economic studies, of which he gave proof by
                    publishing at the age of twenty-two a brief <hi rend="italic">Histoire de la
                        caisse d'escompte.</hi> He was at first destined for the law, next entered a
                    bank, and finally obtained a post in the administration of the Chemin de fer du
                    Nord. Meanwhile he became a regular contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Journal
                        des débats,</hi> where he established his reputation by a series of
                    brilliant attacks on the financial administration of the prefect of the Seine,
                    Haussmann. He displayed talent for interesting popular audiences in economic
                    questions. His sympathies, like those of his grandfather, were with the British
                    school of economists ; he was, indeed, the hereditary defender of free-trade
                    principles in France. He had, moreover, an intimate acquaintance with the
                    English language and institutions, and translated into French Goschen’s <hi
                        rend="italic">Theory of Foreign Exchanges.</hi> He was one of the pioneers
                    of the co-operative movement in France. Elected to the Assembly of 1871 by the
                    departments of Seine and Seine-et-Oise, he adopted the former, and took his seat
                    among the Moderate Liberals, to whose principles he adhered throughout his life.
                    He was immediately chosen as reporter of the commission on the state of the
                    national finances, and in this capacity prepared two elaborate statements.
                    Thiers, though opposing their publication on grounds of public expediency, was
                    much struck by the ability displayed in them, and on the 5th of June appointed
                    Say prefect of the Seine. The fall of the empire, the siege of Paris, and the
                    Commune had reduced the administration of the capital to chaos, and the task of
                    reconstruction severely tried the new prefect’s power of organization. This was,
                    however, a gift with which he was pre-eminently endowed; and be only quitted his
                    post to assume, in December 1872, the ministry of finance—a remarkable tribute
                    to his abilities from Thiers, who himself held strongly protectionist views. In
                    all other respects Say regarded himself as the disciple of Thiers, who, in his
                    last public utterance, designated Say as one of the younger men who would carry
                    on his work. He fell from office with Thiers on the 24th of May 1873, and was
                    elected president of the Left Centre group, as whose candidate he unsuccessfully
                    contested the presidency of the Chamber with Buffet. In spite of their
                    divergence of views, he consented, at the urgent request of President MacMahon,
                    to take office in March 1875 in the Buffet Cabinet; but the reactionary policy
                    of the premier led to a dispute between him and Say both in the press and in the
                    constituencies, and brought about Buffet’s resignation. Say continued to hold
                    the ministry of finance under Dufaure and Jules Simon, and again in the Dufaure
                    ministry of December 1877, and its successor, the Waddington ministry, till
                    December 1879. During this long period, in which he was practically the
                    autocratic ruler of the French finances, he had first to complete the payment of
                    the war indemnity—an operation which, thanks largely to his consummate knowledge
                    of foreign exchanges, was effected long before the prescribed time. It was at a
                    conference held between Say, Gambetta and M. de Freycinet in 1878 that the great
                    scheme of pubh*c works introduced by the latter was adopted. Say’s general;
                    financial policy was to ameliorate the incidence of taxation. As a pendant to
                    his free-trade principles, he believed that the surest way of enriching the
                    country, and therefore the Treasury, was to remove all restrictions on internal
                    commerce. He accordingly reduced the rate of postage, repealed the duties on
                    many articles of prime utility, such as paper, and fought strongly, though
                    unsuccessfully, against the system of <hi rend="italic">octrois.</hi> On the
                    30th of April 1880 he accepted the post of ambassador in London for the purpose
                    of negotiating a commercial treaty between France and England, but the
                    presidency of the Senate falling vacant, he was elected to it on the 25th of
                    May, having meanwhile secured a preliminary understanding, the most important
                    feature of which was a reduction of the duty on the cheaper class of French
                    wines. In January 1882 he became minister of finance in the Freycinet Cabinet,
                    which was defeated in the following July on the Egyptian question. Say’s
                    influence over the rising generation grew less ; his “ academic Liberalism ” was
                    regarded as old-fashioned ; Socialism, which he never ceased to attack, obtained
                    even greater power, and free-trade was discarded in favour of M. Méline’s policy
                    of protection, against which Say vainly organized the <hi rend="italic">Ligue
                        contre le renchérissement du pain.</hi> He had, however, a large share in
                    the successful opposition to the income-tax, which he considered likely to
                    discourage individual effort and thrift. In 1889 he quitted the Senate to enter
                    the Chamber as member for Pau, in the belief that his efforts for Liberalism
                    were more urgently needed in the popular Assembly. Throughout his career he was
                    indefatigable both as a writer and as a lecturer on economics, and in both
                    capacities exerted a far wider influence than in parliament. Special mention
                    must be made of his work, as editor and contributor, on the <hi rend="italic"
                        >Dictionnaire</hi>
                    <hi rend="italic">des finances</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Nouveau Dictionnaire
                        d'économie politique.</hi> His style was easy and lucid, and he was often
                    employed in drawing up important official documents, such as the famous
                    presidential message of December 1877. He was for many years the most prominent
                    member of the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, and in 1886 succeeded
                    to Edmond About’s seat in the Académie Française. He died in Paris on the 21st
                    of April 1896. A selection of his most important writings and speeches has since
                    been published in four volumes under the title of</p>
