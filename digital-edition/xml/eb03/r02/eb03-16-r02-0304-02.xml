in botany : A genus of the monogynia order, belonging to the tetfandria claſs of plants.—The perianth is four-leaved, coloured, and permanent, the leaflet oblong-egged and obtuſe ; there is no corolla, unleſs the calyx be conſidered as ſuch. There are four or eight filaments, ſhorter than the calyx, approaching by pairs, permanent ; the anthers are ſmall. The germ is large and roundiſh ; the ſtyle very ſhort ; the ſtigma ſimple and obtuſe. The berry is globular, fitting on the green reflected calyx, one-celled with an incurved point. There is one ſeed, lensform and rugged. This plant is called <hi rend="italic">Solenoides</hi> by Tournefort, and <hi rend="italic">Piercea</hi> by Miller. It grows naturally in moſt of the iſlands of the Weft Indies. The juice of the berries of the plant wall ftain paper and linen of a bright red colour, and many experiments made with it to colour flowers have ſuc-ceeded extremely well in the following manner : the juice of the berries was preſſed out, and mixed with common water, putting it into a phial, ſhaking it well together for ſome time, till the water was thoroughly tinged ; then the flowers, which were white and juſt fully blown, were cut off, and their ſtalks placed into the phial ; and in one night the flowers have been finely variegated with red ; the flowers on which the experiments were made were the tuberoſe, and the double ’white narciſſus.</p>
