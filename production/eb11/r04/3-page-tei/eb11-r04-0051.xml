Constantine, a hundred years earlier, had condemned the notes of Ulpian and Paul upon Papinian. There were no longer any living jurists to lay down the law <hi rend="italic">(jura condere)</hi>; and, if it was to be gathered from the writings of those who were dead, it was perhaps as well that the use of them should be regulated. The Valentinian law proceeded so far in the same direction. It made a selection of the jurisconsults of the past whose works alone were to be allowed to be cited,—Papinian, Paul, Ulpian and Modestine, the four latest patented counsel of any distinction; Gaius, ol authority previously only in the schools, but whose writings were now approved universally, notwithstand* ing that he had never possessed the <hi rend="italic">jus respondendi',</hi>  and all the earlier jurists whose dicta these five had accepted. But it went yet a step further, for it declared all of them, with the sole exception of Papinian, to be ol the same authority, and degraded the function of the judge in most cases—so far at least as a question of law was concerned—to. the purely arithmetical task of counting up the names which the industry of the advocates on either side had succeeded in adducing in support of these respective contentions. It is probable that, from the days of Hadrian down to Severus Alexander, when the emperor in his council had to frame a rescript or a decree, its tenor would be decided by the vote of the majority; but that was after argument and counter-argument, which must in many cases have modified first impressions. Taking the votes of dead men, who had not heard each other’s reasons for their opinions, was a very different process. It may have been necessary; but it can have been so only because a living jurisprudence had no existence,—because the constructive talent of the earlier Empire had entirely disappeared.</p><p>ii. <hi rend="italic">Ante-Jtistinian Collections of Statutes and Jurisprudence,</hi></p><p>Of cardinal importance for this period were the collections of imperial constitutions made prior to Justinian. There were three of these, viz. the Gregorian, the Hermogenian and the Theodosian Codes;@@ the first two being the work of private hands, though they afterwards received statutory sanction from Theodosius II., the third being due to that emperor himself.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Codex Gregorianus.—</hi>This was a collection of imperial constitutions from Hadrian to Diocletian, made by a certain Gregorius about the end of the 3rd century (a. 295?),who,in Mommsen’s opinion@@was at that time a professor at the law school of Beirut. Only fragments of it have come down to us, obtained chiefly from Alaric’s Breviary, the<hi rend="italic">Lex Romana Burgundionum,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Consultatio,</hi>  the <hi rend="italic">Collatio</hi>  and the Vatican Fragments mentioned below; blit it was a work of considerable size, divided into books and titles.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Codex Ilermogenianus</hi>@@<hi rend="italic"/>This, like the Gregorian, was compiled ¡n the Eastern Empire, apparently at the end of the 3rd century, but at any rate not later than the year 324. As, however, it contains a constitution of the year 365 there must have been subsequent additions to it. Only fragmentary remains of it are extant, obtained from the same sources as the</p><p>Gregorian. Its author was a certain Hermogenianus (perhaps the jurist of that name cited in the Digest), and the work seems to have been intended as a sort of supplement to the Gregorian Code. It was a smaller work than the latter, being divided only into titles, and, unlike it, contains no pre-Diocletian constitutions. . It has, however, a great number of contemporary ones, issued by Diocletian especially during the years 293 and 294. It was from this work and that of Gregorius that Justinian obtained the constitutions contained in his Code for the period prior to Constantine, and from the language he uses about the two Codes it would seem that they had been regarded in the courts before his time as the only authoritative record of constitutions during the period covered by them.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Codex Theodosianus.—</hi>In the year 429 the emperor Theodosius nominated a commission of nine persons to collect the constitutions issued by the emperors from Constantine to his own reign. From the term soft he edict appoint! ng them he seems to have intended to initiate the preparation of a body of law which, if his scheme had been carried into execution, would have rendered that of Justinian unnecessary. In a constitution about ten years later he explains the motives that had actuated him: that he saw with concern the poverty-stricken state of jurisprudence and how few men therewerewho, notwithstanding the prizes that awaited them, were able to make themselves familiar with the whole range of law; and that he attributed it very much to the multitude of books and</p><lb/><p>the lar^e mass of statutes through which the law was dispersed, and which it was next to impossible for any ordinary mortal to master. His.scheme was eventually to compile one single code from materials derived alike from the writings of the jurists, the Gregorian and Hermogenian collections of rescripts, and the constitutions from the time of. Constantine downwards. His language leaves little doubt that it was his intention to have this general code carefully prepared, so as to make it a complete exponent of the existing law, which should take the place of everyth ing, statutory or jurisprudential, of an earlier date. The collection 01 constitutions which he directed his commissioners meantime to prepare, and which was to contain even those that were merely of historical interest (provided only it was made clear how later enactments had affected them), was to be the first step in the execution of his project. For some reason or other nothing followed upon this enactment, and in 435 a new commission of sixteen persons was nominated to collect the constitutions, but nothing was said in their instructions about anything ulterior. They were directed, however, to deal with their material in a systematic way, as by arranging the constitutions chronologically under definite titles, separating, where necessary, any constitutions dealing with more than one matter into parts, so as to bring each matter under its proper title, and with power otherwise to make such omissions, additions and alterations as seemed good to .them for the same object. The work was completed in less than three years and published at Constantinople early in the yeai 438, with the declaration that it should take effect from the 1st of January following, and a copy was sent to Valentinian, who notified it to the senate at Rome and ordained that it should come into force, in the West from the 12th of January 439. The arrangement is in sixteen books, subdivided into titles with rubrics in which the constitutions are as a rule (though not consistently) placed in chronological order. They cover the whole field of law, private and public, civil and criminal, fiscal and administrative, military and ecclesiastical. The private law is contained in the first five books. This code was usually called an later documents “ Theodosianus,’’ without <hi rend="italic">codex</hi>  adjected. All constitutions since Constantine not contained in it were abrogated. The manuscripts in which it has come down to us are very defective, but many lacunae have been filled up from other sources, especially from Alaric’s Breviary. Unfortunately the lacunae are principally in the books relating to the private law.@@</p><p><hi rend="italic">Novellae Post-Theodosianae.—</hi>The imperial constitutions subsequent to the publication of the <hi rend="italic">Theodosianus</hi>  got the name of Novels <hi rend="italic">(novellae leges).</hi>  There were three collections of these, all made in the Western Empire, and they are generally known as. post-Theodosian Novels. The first collection containing edicts of Theodosius himself, sent by him to Valentinian III. in 447, was published by the latter emperor in the following year. -The second collection contained in addition to edicts of Theodosius some edicts of Marcian and other emperors of the East, and also some of Valentinian, Majorian and other emperors of the West. The third collection was published in abridged form in Alaric's Breviary. These collections are not extant, but from Alaric’s Breviary, with additions from manuscript sources, modern editions of the Novels have been prepared.@@There was also a collection of constitutions, issued between the years 331 and 425, nearly all relating to church matters, first published by T. Sirmondus in 1631, and now known as the Sirmondian Constitutions.@@</p><p>Besides the collections of statutes just mentioned there were a number of juristic works of this period, containing both statute law <hi rend="italic">(leges)</hi>  and common law <hi rend="italic">(jus)</hi>  in combination, made by private individuals.
