<p><span class="font0">This table, giving principally impracticable gradients, will only serve to shew us that the ratio of expense is an increasing one, the first differences being respectively Ov :&nbsp;0-7 : 1-05 : 1-33 :0-91 : 1-47: 1-75.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If we admit, till we can obtain better data, that altering our gradients from 1 in 250 to 1 in 500, saves two-tenths of&nbsp;the expense of locomotive power, and that reducing it to a&nbsp;level instead of leaving it at 1 in 500, saves two more&nbsp;tenths, we can easily see what the effect of that would be.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The number of tons carried, as given in the table, is not decreased according to the law of gravity alone, but contains another element, most probably the result of experience on the road in question. Suppose then that on the&nbsp;road we are about to construct we may expect to work seven trains per day each way, with passengers, there being&nbsp;ten carriages in each train, averaging four tons each, and&nbsp;travelling at the rate of twenty miles an hour, and two&nbsp;trains each way with goods, in ten waggons per train, averaging goods and waggons five tons each, and going at the&nbsp;rate of ten miles an hour; also let the railway in question&nbsp;be one hundred miles in length; then at a cost of L.304 per&nbsp;day, the passengers being taken at eighteen in each carriage&nbsp;at £d. each per mile, and the goods at ^d. per ton per mile,&nbsp;at which price it is known they can be carried, we may&nbsp;presume, that if, instead of having an inclination of 1 in 250,&nbsp;our road was level, we should decrease these expenses four-tenths, or bring them to about L.182 per day, or L.66,430&nbsp;per annum. Thus presuming the above to be correct, we&nbsp;should be saving money, if our road could be made level at&nbsp;an additional expense of one million.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each particular railroad must of course form a separate case, but we are persuaded it will generally be found that&nbsp;a large outlay will be justified in approximating to a level&nbsp;as near as possible ; and where the line is entirely so, the&nbsp;cuttings can always be cleared of water, by sloping the side&nbsp;draining down each way, from the centre till they arrive at&nbsp;the nearest water course, where as usual they will deliver&nbsp;their contents. Our practical knowledge of this subject of&nbsp;reducing railways to a level is founded on such slight data,&nbsp;that a careful set of experiments in order to shew the way&nbsp;more fully into such a question is very much wanted; and&nbsp;we question whether hydraulic locks will not be found to&nbsp;save a considerable expense in difficult situations, bringing&nbsp;the trains from one level to another, by which means railways may be made through tracts of country which would&nbsp;otherwise never pay for the necessary outlay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the contracts along the line are fairly at work, one of the first knotty points which the directors will have&nbsp;to decide on, is, the width of the rails, their shape, the&nbsp;length of their bearing, and the form of their chair. The&nbsp;width between the rails has only lately become a subject of&nbsp;dispute ; nearly all the railways prior to the Great Western,&nbsp;having been laid down 4 feet 8£ inches apart. Mr. Brunei&nbsp;has extended it to seven feet; the Irish railway commission&nbsp;recommend six feet two inches; several of the Scottish railways are laid down at five feet six inches ; in fact, the variations run from four and a-half to seven feet.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The question of the stability of the carriages on the railway may be left out of consideration in looking at this matter, because the machinery will always require sufficient space between the wheels to insure this. Now, as four feet&nbsp;eight inches and-a-half are found to be enough for the good&nbsp;performance of an engine, which, with five and a-half feet&nbsp;wheels, will go on a level upwards of 60 miles an hour; as&nbsp;with five-feet wheels, Marshal Soult, on his visit to Liverpool&nbsp;just after the Queen’s coronation, was taken over lOf miles&nbsp;of favourable ground on the Grand Junction Railway within 10 minutes; and as an engine has gone 60 miles an hour&nbsp;on the London and Birmingham Railway up an inclined&nbsp;plane, is it wise or prudent to make any change at all,&nbsp;and will any additional speed, which may be gained by&nbsp;increasing the width of the rails and the diameter of the&nbsp;wheels, compensate for the greater expense and the outlay&nbsp;which will constantly be required to keep the road in order&nbsp;on account of the increased weight ? This will receive light&nbsp;from the experiments on the Great Western, but will not&nbsp;be fully decided until it be tried on the Irish or some other&nbsp;railways, as Mr. Brunei’s rails are altogether different from&nbsp;most others in use. The plan recommended by the Irish&nbsp;railway commissioners, of putting the rails farther apart but&nbsp;not widening the carriages, merely making the wheels run&nbsp;outside the bodies, is a good one in some respects ; but it&nbsp;would add to the expense of the works considerably, and&nbsp;the result would be exceedingly questionable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It must not be forgotten, that, whereadifferent width from that in common use is adopted, the railway on which it is&nbsp;used becomes isolated. None but its own carriages can&nbsp;travel on it, and they can travel on no other line. This alone&nbsp;will, in most cases, be a serious objection. For our own parts&nbsp;we should say, let w<sup>r</sup>ell alone ; wait for more experience ; we&nbsp;are yet infants amongst railways, and we ought not to innovate on that which has been proved to do well, until we become giants. The majority of opinions, however, are beginning to lean towards some increase in the width, although&nbsp;there is every diversity in the quantity which practical men&nbsp;think necessary. Certainly the machinery under the boiler&nbsp;is compressed into its minimum space, and more room for&nbsp;it would be a great advantage, if it does not induce an incommensurate loss in other ways.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With respect to the form of the rail, it can be proved that a fish belly has greater strength, weight for weight, than&nbsp;any other. A 601b. fish belly at three-feet bearings, rolled&nbsp;with a lower web, would be the best form of all; and this&nbsp;has been effected, as the original Liverpool and Manchester&nbsp;rails had partially this shape. The question, however, must&nbsp;be looked at in conjunction with the length between the&nbsp;supports. We have given below those forms most approved of in practice, and have added that in use on the Great&nbsp;Western Railway, which is however light, and does not&nbsp;stand well, three feet having been the original distance of the&nbsp;bearings.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 3 is the old Liverpool and Manchester rail, laid down at three-feet bearings; weight thirty-three lbs. per yard, with&nbsp;square joints. This rail was rolled with a lateral swell at the&nbsp;bottom, which on one side was continued the whole length,&nbsp;but on the other did not quite reach the chair. One side&nbsp;of the chair was cast with a cavity, into which the lateral&nbsp;swell fitted, and the opposite side had a nearly similar opening, in which was driven an iron key, shaped like a wedge,&nbsp;which, entering in a longitudinal direction, not only forced&nbsp;the swell into the cavity which was formed to receive it, but&nbsp;by this means, at the same time, kept the rail down in the&nbsp;chair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Fig. 4. Losh’s patent rail, in which he sought to gain a still more powerful mode of keeping the rail down in the&nbsp;chair, by having his key tapered vertically as well as longitudinally, so as to act as a wedge downwards, as well as in&nbsp;the direction of its length ; whilst, at the same time, the necessary expansion and contraction is allowed to take place.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
