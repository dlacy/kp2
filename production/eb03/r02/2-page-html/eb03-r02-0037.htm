<p><span class="font1">notice of our </span><span class="font0">geographers. We cannot divine what has cauſed Mr Buffon to ſay that the courſe of moſt riverg&nbsp;is from eaſt to weſt or from weſt to eaſt. No phy∩cal&nbsp;point of his ſyſtem ſeems to require it, and it needs only that we look at his own map to fee its falſity. We&nbsp;ſhould naturally expect: to find the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">general</span><span class="font0"> courſe of rivers nearly perpendicular to the line of ſea-coaſt; and&nbsp;we find it ſo ; and the chief exceptions </span><span class="font1">are </span><span class="font0">in oppoſi-tion to Mr Buffon’s aſſertion. The ſtructure of America is ſo particular, that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">very few</span><span class="font0"> of its rivers have&nbsp;their general courſe in this direction. We proceed now&nbsp;to conſider the motion of rivers ; a ſubject which naturally reſolves itſelf into two parts, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">theoretical</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">practical.</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h2><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Part</span><span class="font4"> I. THEORY or </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">the</span><span class="font4"> MOTION </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">of</span><span class="font4"> RIVERS </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">and</span><span class="font4"> CANALS.</span></h2>
<p><span class="font0">THE importance of this ſubject needs no commentary. Every nation, every country, every city, is intereſted in it. Neither our wants, our comforts, nor&nbsp;our pleaſures, can diſpenſe with an ignorance of it. We&nbsp;muſt conduct their waters to the centre of our dwellings ; we muſt ſecure ourſelves againſt their ravages ;&nbsp;we muſt employ them to drive thoſe machines which,&nbsp;by compenſating for our perſonal weakneſs, make a few&nbsp;able to perform the work of thouſands ; we employ&nbsp;them to water and fertilize our fields, to decorate our&nbsp;manſions, to cleanſe and embelliſh our cities, to preſerve&nbsp;or extend our demeſnes, to tranſport from county to&nbsp;county every thing which neceſſity, convenience, or&nbsp;luxury, has rendered precious to man : for theſe purpoſes we muſt confine and govern the mighty rivers,&nbsp;we muſt preſerve or change the beds of the ſmaller&nbsp;ſtreams, draw off from them what ſhall water our fields,&nbsp;drive our machines, or ſupply our houſes. We muſt&nbsp;keep up their waters for the purpoſes of navigation, or&nbsp;ſupply their places by canals ; we muſt drain our fens,&nbsp;and defend them when drained ; we muſt underſtand&nbsp;their motions, and their mode of ſecret, flow, but un-ceaſing action, that our bridges, our wharfs, our dikes,&nbsp;may not become heaps of ruins. Ignorant how to proceed in theſe daily recurring caſes, bow often do we ſee&nbsp;projects of high expectation and heavy expence fail of&nbsp;their object, leaving the ſtate burdened with works not</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">only uſeleſs but frequently hurtful ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This has long been a moſt intereſting ſubject of ſtudy in Italy, where the fertility of their fields is not more&nbsp;indebted to their rich foil and happy climate, than to&nbsp;their numerous derivations from the rivers which traverse them : and in Holland and Flanders, where their&nbsp;very exiſtence requires unceaſing attention to the waters,&nbsp;which are every moment ready to ſwallow up the inhabitants ; and where the inhabitants, having once fob -dued this formidable enemy, have made thoſe very waters their indefatigable drudges, tranſporting through&nbsp;every corner of the country the materials of the moſt&nbsp;extenſive commerce on the face of this globe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such having been our inceſſant occupations with moving waters, we ſhould expect that while the operative artiſts are continually furniſhing facts and experiments,&nbsp;the man of ſpeculative and ſcientiſic curioſity, excited&nbsp;by the importance of the ſubject, would ere now have&nbsp;made conſiderable progreſs in the ſcience ; and that the&nbsp;profeſſional engineer would be daily acting from eſtabliſhed principle, and be ſeldom diſappointed in his expectations. Unfortunately the reverſe of this is nearly the true ſtate of the caſe ; each engineer is obliged&nbsp;to collect the greateſt part of his knowledge from his&nbsp;own experience, and by many dear-bought leſſons, to&nbsp;direct his future operations, in which he ſtill proceeds&nbsp;with anxiety and heſitation : for we have not yet acquired principles of theory, and experiments have not&nbsp;yet been collected and publiſhed, by which an empirical&nbsp;practice might be ſafely formed. Many experiments of&nbsp;ineſtimable value are daily made ; but they remain with&nbsp;their authors, who ſeldom have either leiſure, ability, or&nbsp;generoſity, to add them to the public ſtock.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The motion of waters has been really ſo little inveſ-tigated as yet, that hydraulics may ſtill be called a new ſtudy. We have merely ſhimmed over a few common&nbsp;notions concerning the motions of water ; and the mathematicians of the firſt order ſeem to have contented&nbsp;themſelves with ſuch views as allowed them to entertain themſelves with elegant applications of calculus.&nbsp;This, however, has not been their fault. They rarely&nbsp;had any opportunity of doing more, for want of a&nbsp;knowledge of facts. They have made excellent uſe of&nbsp;the few which have been given them j but it required&nbsp;much labour, great variety of opportunity, and great&nbsp;expence, to learn the multiplicity of things which are&nbsp;combined even in the ſimpleſt caſes of water in motion.&nbsp;Theſe are ſeldom the lot of the mathematician ; and he&nbsp;is without blame when he enjoys the pleaſures within&nbsp;his reach, and cultivates the ſcience of geometry in its&nbsp;moſt abſtracted form. Here he makes a progreſs which&nbsp;is the boaſt of human reaſon, being almoſt inſured from&nbsp;error by the intellectual ſimplicity of his ſubject. But&nbsp;when we turn our attention to material objects, and&nbsp;without knowing either the ſize and ſhape of the elementary particles, or the laws which nature has preſcribed for their action, preſume to foreſee their effects,&nbsp;calculate their exertions, direct their actions, what muſt&nbsp;be the conſequence ? Nature ſhows her independence&nbsp;with reſpect to our notions, and, always faithful to the&nbsp;laws which are injoined, and of which we are ignorant,&nbsp;ſhe never fails to thwart our views, to diſconcert our&nbsp;projects, and render uſeleſs all our efforts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To wiſh to know the nature of the elements is vain, and our groſs organs are infoſſicient for the ſtudy. To&nbsp;ſuppoſe what we do not know, and to fancy ſhapes and&nbsp;ſizes at will ; this is to raiſe phantoms, and will produce a ſyſtem, but will not prove a foundation, for any&nbsp;ſcience. But to interrogate Nature herſelf, ſtudy the&nbsp;laws which ſhe ſo faithfully obſerves, catch her, as we&nbsp;ſay, in the fact, and thus wreſt from her the ſecret; this&nbsp;is the only way to become her maſter, and it is the only procedure conſiſtent with good ſenſe. And we ſee,&nbsp;that ſoon after Kepler detected the laws of the planetary motions, when Galileo diſcovered the uniform acceleration of gravity, when Paſchal diſcovered the pref≈&nbsp;fore of the atmoſphere, and Newton diſcovered the laws&nbsp;of attraction and the track of a ray of light; aſtronomy,&nbsp;mechanics, hydroſtatics, chemiſtry, optics, quickly be</span></p>
