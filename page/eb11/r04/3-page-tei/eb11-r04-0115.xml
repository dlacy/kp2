                                                  with colonies and flooded with Roman settlers, was

                                                  boy-king. Antiochus was to take Coele-Syria and
                                                  Phoenicia, while Philip claimed for his share
                                                  the districts subject to Egypt on the coasts of
                                                  the Aegean and the Greek islands. Philip no doubt
                                                  hoped to be able to secure these unlawful

                                                  plans. But the obstinate resistance offered by
                                                  Attalus of Pergamum and the Rhodians upset his
                                                  calculations. In 201 Rome made peace with
                                                  Carthage, and the senate had leisure to listen to
                                                  the urgent appeal for assistance which reached her
                                                  from her Eastern allies. With Antiochus indeed the
                                                  senate was not yet prepared to quarrel; but with
                                                  Philip the senate had no thoughts of a peaceful
                                                  settlement. Their animosity against him has been
                                                  deepened by the assistance he had recently
                                                  rendered to Carthage. Always an unsafe and
                                                  turbulent neighbour, he would, if allowed to
                                                  become supreme in the Aegean, prove as dangerous
                                                  to her interests in the East as Carthage had been

                                                  <p>The war began in the summer of 200 B.c., and,
                                                  though the landing of the Roman legions in Epirus
                                                  was not followed, as had been hoped, by any
                                                  general rising against Philip, yet the latter had
                                                  soon to discover that, if they were not
                                                  enthusiastic for Rome, they were still less
                                                  inclined actively to assist himself. Neither by
                                                  force nor by diplomacy could he make any progress
                                                  south of Boeotia. The fleets of Pergamum and
                                                  Rhodes, now the zealous allies of Rome, protected
                                                  Attica and watched the eastern coasts. The
                                                  Achaeans and Nabis of Sparta were obstinately
                                                  neutral, while nearer home in the north the
                                                  Epirots and Aetolians threatened Thessaly and
                                                  Macedonia. His own resources both in men and in
                                                  money had been severely strained by his constant
                                                  wars,@@<hi rend="sup">8</hi> and the only ally who
                                                  could have given him effective assistance,
                                                  Antiochus, was fully occupied with the conquest of
                                                  Coele-Syria. It is no wonder then that, in spite
                                                  of his dashing generalship and high courage, he
                                                  made but a brief stand. T. Quinctius Flamininus
                                                  (consul 198), in his first year of command,
                                                  defeated him on the Aous, drove him back to the
                                                  pass of Tempe, and in the next year utterly routed
                                                  him at Cynoscephalae. Almost at the same moment
                                                  the Achaeans, who had now joined Rome, took
                                                  Corinth, and the Rhodians defeated his troops in

                                                  was impossible; Philip submitted, and early
