            <p><hi rend="smallcaps">gravity,</hi> mentioning ſuch circumſtances of the results as
                ſuited our purpoſes of phyſical diſcuſſion. At preſent we give the general reluit in
                the table oſ ſpecific gravity, as peculiarly belonging to ſpirituous liquors,
                affording the moſt exact: account of their denſity in every ſtate of dilution of
                alcohol with water. And as the relation between the proportion of ingredients and
                the denſity is peculiar to every ſubstance, ſo that ſcarcely any inference can be
                made from one to another, the reader will consider the tables here given as
                characteristic with reſpect to alcohol. In all ſolutions of salts we found that the
                condenſation increases continually with the dilution, whereas it is greatest when
                equal bulks of water and alcohol are mixed : yet we do not conſider this as an
                exception ; for it is certain, that in the ſtrongest brine the ſaline ingredient
                bears but a ſmall proportion to the water—and when we mix two ſolutions, the
                condenſation is greateſt when they are nearly equal in bulk. But we think ourſelves
                entitled to infer, that alcohol is not a dilution of a ſubftance in a quantity of
                water; but that water, in a certain proportion, not very distant from what we can
                produce by flow diſtillation, is an ingredient of alcohol, or is one of its
                component parts, and not merely a vehicle or menſtruum. We therefore imagine that
                proof ſpirit contains nearly equal bulks of water and ardent ſpirits.</p>
            <p>The great difficulty in this examination aroſe from the very diſſimilar expansions of
                water and alcohol by heat. This determined Sir Charles Blagden to estimate the
                proportions of ingredients by weight, and made it abſolutely neceſſary to give a
                ſcale of ſpecific gravity and strength for every temperature. For it must be
                remarked, that the question (whether in commerce or philoſophy) always is, “ How
                many gallons of alcohol and of water, taken just now and mixed together, will
                produce a hundred gallons of the ſpirit we are examining ?” The proportion of theſe
                two will be different according to the temperature of both. As many mixtures
                therefore must have been made in each proportion as there were temperatures
                conſidered ; but by taking the ingredients by weight, and examining the denſity of
                the compound in one temperature, it is then heated and cooled, and its change of
                denſity obſerved. Calculation then can tell us the change in the proportion of the
                bulks or numbers of gallons in the mixture, by means of a previous table ſhowing the
                expansions of water and of alcohol.</p>
            <p>The alcohol ſelected for this examination had the speciſic gravity 0,825. This is not
                the purest that can be procured ; ſome was produced oſ 0,816, of 0,814, and 0,81 3,
                both obtained from rum, from brandy, and from malt ſpirit. We are informed that Dr
                Black has obtained it of the ſpecific gravity 0,8 by digeſting alcohol with fixed
                ammoniac (muriatic acid united with lime) made very dry. It dephlegmates alcohol
                very powerfully without decompoſing it, which always happens when we uſe cauſtic
                alkali. Alcohol of 0,825 was choſen becauſe expreſſed by a number of eaſy management
                in computation.</p>
            <p>The examination commenced by aſcertaining the expanſions of water and alcohol. The
                temperature 60⁰ of Fahrenheit’s ſcale was ſelected for the general temperature of
                compariſon, being eaſily attainable even in cold weather, and allowing the
                examinator to operate at eaſe. The firſt and laſt copartments of the tables contain
                the weights and ſpecific gravities of alcohol and water for every fifth degree of
                heat from 30⁰ to 100⁰. From theſe we have conſtructed the two following little
                tables of expanſion. The bulk of 1000 ounces, pounds, or other weight of water and
                of alcohol of the temperature 60⁰, occupies the bulks expreſſed in the tables for
                every other temperature. Water could not be eaſily or usefully examined when of the
                temperature 30⁰, becauſe it is with great difficulty kept fluid in that temperature.
                It is very remarkable, that when it can be ſo kept, it expands instead of
                contracting ; while cooling down from 35⁰ or thereabouts, and as it approaches to
                32⁰, it expands rapidly. We obſerve the ſame thing in the cryſtallization of Glauber
                salt, martial vitriol, and ſome others, which contain much water in their crystals.
                We obſerve, on the other hand, a remarkable contraction in the zeolite just before
                its beginning to ſwell into bubbles by a red heat.</p>

            <p>This being premiſed, the examination was conducted in the following manner. It was
                determined to mix 100 parts by weight of pure alcohol with five, ten, fifteen,
                twenty, parts of distilled water, till they were compounded in equal quantities, and
                then to mix 100 parts of distilled water with 95, 90,85, 80, &amp;c. parts of
                alcohol, till they were mixed in the proportion of 100 to 5. Thus a ſeries of
                mixtures would be obtained, extending from pure alcohol to pure water. This ſeries
                would be ſuch, that the examinations would be moſt frequent in the cases moſt uſual
                in the commerce of ſtrong liquors. A ſet of phials, fitted with ground ſtoppers,
                were provided, of ſizes fit to hold the intended mixtures. Theſe mixtures were made
