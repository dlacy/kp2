<p><label>RHETORES</label>, amongſt the Athenians, were ten in number, elected by lot to plead public cauſes in the ſenate-houſe or affembly. For every cauſe in which they were retained, they received a drachm out of the public money. They were ſometimes called and their fee Συν^ο^ικον. No man was admitted to this office before he was 40 years of age, though others ſay 30. Valour in war, piety to their parents, prudence in their affairs, frugality, and temperance, were neceffary qualifications for this office, and every candidate underwent an examination concerning theſe virtues previous to the election. The orators at Rome were not unlike the Athenian rhetores. See Orator.</p>
