Notwithſtand-ing this appearance of extreme heat, however, the ſen-ſation was by no means intolerable ; they could hunt at&nbsp;mid-day, and felt the evenings rather cold. The ſod&nbsp;is a fat, looſe, black earth, which our author ſays is the&nbsp;ſame from 13° to 1 6° of north latitude-; at leaſt till&nbsp;we come to the deſerts of Atbara, where the tropical&nbsp;rains ceaſe. This conntry divides that of the Shan-galla into two parts, nearly equal. Theſe people in-habit a belt of land about 60 miles broad, all along&nbsp;the northern frontier of Abyſſinia, excepting two large&nbsp;gaps or ſpaces which have been left open for the ſake&nbsp;of commerce, and which are inhabited by ſtrangers, to-keep the Shangalla in awe. The latter trade in gold,&nbsp;which they pick up in the ſtreams as it is waſhed down&nbsp;from the mountains ; for there are no mines in their&nbsp;country, neither is there any gold in Abyſſinia, excepting wliat is imported from this or ſome other country’.&nbsp;The Shangalla are the natural enemies of the inhabitants of Ras-el-Feel, and much blood has been ſhed in&nbsp;the various incurſions they have made upon one ano-ther ; thougſh of late thoſe of Ras-el-Feel, by the aſſiſt-ance of the emperors, have been enabled to keep the&nbsp;Shangalla at bay.</span></p>

Hence it has obtained the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ras-Sem,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">or the fountain of poiſon. The only remains of antiquity in this place conſiſt of the ruins of a tower or&nbsp;fortification, which, in the opinion of Mr Bruce, is as&nbsp;late as the time of the vandals ; but he ſays he cannot&nbsp;imagine what ufe they made of the water, and they&nbsp;had no other within two days journey of the place.—&nbsp;Here our traveller ſaw many of the animals called&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jerboa,</span><span class="font1"> a kind of mice ; which, he fays, ſeem to partake as much of the nature oſ a bπd as of a qua-druped.</span></p>

The only appearance of a harbour in Rafay&nbsp;is at Clachan Bay, where Mr Macleod the proprietor of&nbsp;the iſland reſides. Raſay preſents a bold ſhore, w<sup>,</sup>hιch&nbsp;riſes to the height of mountains ; and here the natives&nbsp;have, with incredible labour, formed many little corn&nbsp;fields and patato grounds. Theſe heights decreaſe at&nbsp;the ſouth end, where there are ſome farms and a good-looking country. Mr Macleod is ſole proprietor of this»&nbsp;iſland, and of Rona and Fladda at the north end of 1t<sub>ft&nbsp;</sub>which are only proper for grazing.</span></p>

But as he found his family increafe, he reſolved to retire to ſome cheap country ;&nbsp;and accordingly removed, in 1 707, to weſel, where he&nbsp;wrote his Hiſtory of England, and lome other pieces.&nbsp;Thouoh he was of a ſtrong conſtitution, yet ſeventeen&nbsp;years application (for ſo long was he in compofing the&nbsp;hiſtory juſt mentioned) entirely ruined his health.

His Hiſtory of England, printed at the Hague in 1726 and 1727, in 9&nbsp;vols 4to, and reprinted·at Trevoux m 1728, in 10 vols&nbsp;<sub>4</sub>to. This laſt edition is more complete than that ot&nbsp;the Hague. It has been tranſlated into Enghſh, and&nbsp;improved with Notes, by the Reverend Mr Tſhdal, in&nbsp;<sub>2</sub> vols folio. This performance, though the work of&nbsp;a foreigner, is defervedly eſteemed as the. fulleſt and&nbsp;moſt impartial collection of Enghſh political tranſactions extant.
