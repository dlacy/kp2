        <body>
            <p>of the ſhip for his purpoſe. By this government judge <hi rend="italic">of</hi> the
                ſhips requiſite for tranſport ſervice, and by this are all revenue charges on the
                ſhip computed. It is no leſs difficult to anſwer this queſtion by any general rule
                which ſhall be very exact, becauſe it depends not only on the cubical dimenſions of
                the ſhip’s bottom, but alſo on the ſcantling of her whole frame, and in ſhort on the
                weight of every thing which properly makes part of a ſhip ready to receive on board
                her cargo. The weight of timber is variable ; the ſcantling of the frame is no leſs
                ſo. We muſt therefore be contented with an average value which is not very remote
                from the truth ; and this average is to be obtained, not by any mathematical
                diſcuſſion, but by obſervation of the burthen or cargo actually received, in a great
                variety of cases. But ſome fort of rule of calculation muſt be made out. This is and
                muſt be done by perſons not mathematicians. We may therefore expect to find it
                incapable of being reduced to any principle, and that every builder will have a
                different rule. Accordingly the rules given for this purpoſe are in general very
                whimſical, measures being uſed and combined in a way that ſeems quite unconnected
                with ſtercometry or the meaſurement of solids. The rules for calculation are even
                affected by the intereſts of the two parties oppoſitely concerned in the reſult. The
                calculation for the tonnage by which the cuſtoms are to be exacted by government are
                quite different from the rule by which the tonnage of a transport hired by
                government is computed ; and the ſame ſhip hired as a tranſport will be computed
                near one half bigger than when paying importation duties.</p>
            <p>Yet the whole of this might be made a very simple buſineſs and very exact. When the
                ſhip is launched, let her light-water line be marked, and this with the cubical
                contents of the immerſed part be noted down, and be engroſſed in the deed by which
                the property of the ſhip is conveyed from hand to hand. The weight of her maſts,
                sails, rigging, and ſea-ſtores, is moſt eaſily obtained ; and every builder can
                compute the cubical contents of the body when immerſed to the load water line. The
                difference of theſe is unqueſtionably the burthen of the ſhip.</p>
            <p>It is evident from what has been already ſaid in the laſt chapter, that if the number
                of cubic feet of water which the ſhip diſplaces when light, or, which is the ſame,
                the number of cubic feet below the light water line, found by the preceding method
                of calculation, be ſubtracted from the number of cubic feet contained in the bottom
                below the load water line, and the remainder reduced to tons by multiplying by 74,
                the number of pounds in a cubic foot of ſea water, and divided by 2240, the number
                of pounds in a ton, the quotient will be the tonnage.</p>
            <p>But as this method is very troubleſome, the following rule for this purpoſe is that
                which is uſed in the king’s and merchant’s ſervice.</p>
            <p>Let fall a perpendicular from the foreſide of the ſtem at the height of the hawſe
                holes @@<hi rend="smallcaps">(h),</hi> and another perpendicular from the back of
                the main poſt at the height</p>
            <p>of the wing tranſom. From the length between theſe two perpendiculars deduct
                three-fifths of the extreme breadth @@(I), and alſo as many times 2 ½ inches as
                there are feet in the height of the wing tranſom above the upper edge of the keel ;
                the remainder is the length of the keel for tonnage. Now multiply this length by the
                extreme breadth, and the product by half the extreme breadth, and this laſt product
                divided by 94 is the tonnage required.</p>
            <p>Or, multiply the length of the keel for tonnage by the ſquare of the extreme breadth,
                and the product divided by 188 will give the tonnage.</p>
