<p><span class="font0">he ever painted, except thofe beautiful and chaſte ones which compofe the back grounds of many of his por-traſts, is “ A View on the Thames from Richmond,”&nbsp;which in 1784 was exhibited by the Society for Pro-moting Painting and Deſign in Liverpool.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1764 Mr Reynolds had the merit of being tbe ſirſt promoter of that club, which, having long exiſted&nbsp;without a name, became at laſt diſtinguiſhed by the ap-pellation of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Literary Club.</span><span class="font0"> Upon tbe foundation&nbsp;of the Royal Academy of Painting, Sculpture, and Architecture, he was appointed preſident·; and his ac-knowledged excellence in his profeffion made the appointment acceptable to all the lovers of art. To add&nbsp;to the dignity of this new inſtitution, his majeſty conferred on the preſident the honour of knighthood ; and&nbsp;Sir Joſhua delivered his ſirſt diſcourſe at the opening of&nbsp;the Academy on Januar)' 2. 1769. The merit of that&nbsp;diſcourſe has been univerfally admitted among painters ;&nbsp;but it contains ſome directions reſpecting the proper&nbsp;mode of proſecuting their ſtudies, to which every ſtu-dent of every art would do well to pay attention. “ I&nbsp;would chiefly recommend (ſays he), that an implicit&nbsp;obedience to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rules of art,</span><span class="font0"> as eſtabliſhed by the prac-tice of the great maſters, ſhould be exacted from the&nbsp;young ſtudents. That thoſe models, which have paſſed&nbsp;through the approbation of ages, ſhould be conſidered&nbsp;by them as perfect and infallible guides; as fubjects for&nbsp;their imitation, not tlieir criticiſm. I am confident,&nbsp;that this is tlie only efficacious method of making a&nbsp;progreſs in tlie arts ; and that lie who ſets out with&nbsp;doubting, will find life finiſhed before he becomes maſſer&nbsp;of the rudiments. For it may be laid down as a maxim, that be who begins by preſuming on his own ſenſe,&nbsp;has ended his ſtudies as ſoon as he has commenced them.&nbsp;Every opportunity, therefore, ſhould be taken to dif-countenance that falſe and vulgar opinion, that rules&nbsp;are the fetters of genius. They are fetters only to men&nbsp;■of no genius ; as that armour which, upon the ſtrong,&nbsp;becomes an ornament and a defence, upon the weak and&nbsp;iniſhapen turns into a load, and cripples the body which&nbsp;it was made to protect.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Each ſucceeding year, on the diſtribution of the prizes, Sir Joſhua delivered to tlie ſtudents a diſcourſe&nbsp;of equal merit with this : and perhaps we do not hazard too much when we ſay, that, from the whole col-lected, the lover of belles lettres and the fine arts will&nbsp;acquire juſter notions oſ what is meant by taſte in ge-r.eral, and better rules for acquiring a correct taſte,&nbsp;than from multitudes of thoſe volumes which have been&nbsp;profeſſedly written on the ſubject.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the autumn of 1785 he went to Bruſſels, where he expended about L. 1000 on the purchaſe of paint-ingg, which, having been taken from the different mo-naſterſes and religious houſes in Flanders and Germany,&nbsp;were then expoſed to ſale by tbe command of the Em-peror Joſeph ! Gainſborough and he had engaged to&nbsp;paint each other’s portrait; and the canvas for both being actually ſtretched, Sir Joſhua gave one fitting to&nbsp;his diſtinguiſhed rival ; but, to the regret of every ad-mirer of the art, the unexpected death of the latter pre-vented all further progreſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1790 he was anxiouſſy deſirous to procure the vacant profefforſhip of perſpective in the academy for Mr Bonomi, an Italian architect ; but that artiſt not having been yet elected, an affociate was of courſe no academician, and it became neceſſary to raife him to thoſe&nbsp;ſituations, in order to qualify him for being a profeffor.&nbsp;Mr Gilpin being his competitor for the affociateſhip,&nbsp;the numbers on the ballot proved equal, when the preſident by bis caſting vote decided the election in favour&nbsp;of his friend, who was thereby advanced ſo far towards&nbsp;the profeſſorſhip. Soon after this, an academic ſeat be-ing vacant, Sir Joſhua exerted all his influence to ob-tain it for Mr Bonomi ; but finding himſelf outvoted by&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">majority of two to one, he quitted the chair with&nbsp;great diſſatisſaction, and next day ſent to the fecretary&nbsp;of th&amp;academy a formal reſignation of the office, which&nbsp;for twenty-one years he had filled with honour to himſelf and his country. His indignation, however, ſub-ſiding, he ſuffered himſelf to be prevailed upon to re-turn to the chair, which within a year and a half he&nbsp;was again deſirous to quit for a better reaſon.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Finding a diſeaſe of languor, occaſioned by an en-largementof the liver, to wliich he had for ſome time been ſubject, increaſe upon him, and daily expecting the total loſs of ſight, he wrote a letter to the academy, inti-mating his intention to reſign the office of preſident on&nbsp;account of bodily infirmities, which difabled him from&nbsp;executing the duties of it to his own ſatisſaction. The&nbsp;academicians received this intelligence with the reſpect-ful concern due to the talents and virtues of their pre-ſident ; and either then did enter, or deſigned to enter,&nbsp;into a refolution, honourable to all parties, namely, that&nbsp;a deputation from the whole body of the academy ſhould&nbsp;wait upon him, jand inform him of their wiſh, that the&nbsp;authority and privileges of the office of preſident might&nbsp;be his during his life ; declaring their willingneſs to&nbsp;permit the performance of any of its duties which might&nbsp;be irkſome to him by a deputy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">From this period Sir Joſhua never painted more. The laſt effort of his pencil was the portrait of the Honourable Charles James Fox, which was executed in his</span></p><div>
