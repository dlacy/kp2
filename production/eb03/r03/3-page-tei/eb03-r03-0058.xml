N Lat. 52. ſituated on the north bank of the river Maeſe, about 37 miles ſouth of Amſterdam, nine ſouth-eaſt of the Hague, and 15 to the eaſtward of Brief It is a large and populous city, of a triangular figure, handſomely built of brick, the ftreets w<hi rend="sub">f</hi>ide and well paved. There are ten gates to the town, ſix of which are at the land fide and four at the fide of the Maeſe. It is ſuppoſed to take its name from the<hi rend="italic">Roter,</hi>  or <hi rend="italic">Rotter,</hi>  a little river that falls into the canals of this city, and from <hi rend="italic">Dam,</hi>  a dike. It is uncertain wſhen it was ſirſt built ; and though ſt is ſuppoſed to be very ancient, yet we find no mention made of it before the I 3th century. In the year 1270 it was ſurrounded with ramparts, and honoured with ſeveral privileges; but 27 years after it was taken by the Flemings. In the year 1418, Brederode chief of the Hacks made him-ſelſ maſter of it ; ſince which time it has continued yearly to increaſe by means of the conveniency of its harbour. Its arms are vert, a pale argent, quarterly in a chief on the ſirſt and third, or, a lion ſpotted fable, on the ſecond and fourth a lion ſpotted gules.</p><p>Rotterdam is not reckoned one of the principal cities of the province, becauſe it has not been always in its preſent flouriſhing condition. The Dutch call it the ſirſt of the ſecond rank, whereas it ought to be eſteemed the ſecond of the firſt, being, next to Amſterdam, the moſt trading town in the United Provinces. Its port is very commodious ; for the canals, which run through moſt parts of the town, bring the ſhips, ſome of 200 or 300 ton, up to the merchants door ; a conveniency for loading and unloading which is not to be found in other places. The great ſhips go up into the middle of the town by the canal into which the Maeſe enters by the old head,· as it comes out by the new. A ſtranger, upon his firſt entering this place, is aſto-piſhed at the beautiful confufion of chimneys intermixed with tops of trees with which the canals are planted, and ſtreamers of veſſels ; inſomuch that he can hardly tell whether it be fleet, city, or foreſt. The Harring Vliet is a very fine ſtreet ; moſt of the houſes are new, and built of hewn ſtone ; but the grandeſt as well as moſt agreeable ſtreet in Rotterdam is the Bomb Quay, which lies parallel with the Maeſe ; or» one fide it is open to the river, and the other is ornamented with a grand facade of the beſt houſes in the city, inhabited chiefly by the Engliſh ; they are five or ſix ſtories high, maſſy and very clumſy : wherever there is any attempt at ornament, it is the worſt that can be conceived. One ſees no Grecian architecture, except Doric entablatures, ſtuck upon the top of the upper ilory, without pilaſters ; Ionic volutes, turned often the wrong way, and an attempt at Corinthian capitals, without any other part of the order. The doors are large, and ſtuck with great knobs and clumſy carving; you aſctnd to them, not in front, but by three or four ſteps going up on each fide, and you are aſſiſted by iron rails of a tnoſt immenſe thickneſs. Theſe houſes are almoſt all window ; and the window ſhutters and frames being painted green, the glaſs has all a green, call, which is helped by the reflection from the trees that overſhadow their houſes, which, were it not ſor this circumſtance, would be intolerably hot, from their vicinity to the canals. Moſt of the houſes have lookmg-glaſſes placed on the outſides of the windows, on both ſides, in order that they may ſee every thing which paſſes up and down the ſtreet. The ſtair-caſes are narrow, ſteep, and come down almoſt to the door. In general, the houſes riſe with enormous ſteep roofs, turning the gable end to the ſtreet, and leaning conſiderably f6rward, ſo that the top often projects near two feet beyond the perpendicular. The Bomb Quay is ſo broad, that there are diſtinct walks ſor carriages and foot-paſſengers, lined and lhaded with a double row of trees.—You look over the river on ſome beautiful meadows, and a fine avenue of trees, which leads to the Peſt-houſe : it ſeems to be an elegant building, and the trees round it are ſo diſpoſed as to appear a thick wood. This ſtreet is at leaſt half a mile in length, and extends from the old to the new head, the two places where the water enters to fill the canals of this extenſive city. When water ru∏3 through a ſtreet, it then aſſumes the name of a canal, of which kind the Heeren-fleet has the pre-eminence ; the houſes are of free-ſtone, and very lofty ; the canal is ſpacious, and covered wfith ſhips : at one end ſtands the Engliſh church, a neat pretty building, of which the biſhop of London is ordinary.</p><p>This port is much more frequented by the Britiſh merchants than Amſterdam, inſomuch that, after a fro’ft, when the ſea is open, ſometimes 300 ſail of Britiſh veſſels ſail out of the harbour at once. There is alwavs a large number of Britiſh ſubjects who reſide in this town, and live much in the ſame manner as in Great Britain. The reaſon of the great traffic between this place and England, is becauſe the ſhips can generally load and unload, and return to England from Rotterdam, before a ſhip can get clear from Amſterdam and the Texel. Hence the Engliſh merchants-find it cheaper and more commodious, after their goods are arrived at Rotterdam, to ſend them in boats over the canals to Amſterdam. .Another great advantage they have here for commerce is, that the Maeſe is open, and the paſſage free from ice, much ſooner in the ſpring than in the Y and Zuyder-ſea, which lead to Amſterdam.</p><p>The glaſs-houſe here is one of the beſt in the ſeven provinces ; it makes abundance of glaſs-toys and enamelled bowls, which are ſent to India, and exchanged for china-ware, and other oriental commodities.</p><p>The college of admiralty here is called the <hi rend="italic">college of the Maeſe,</hi>  the chief of all Holland and the United Provinces. The lieutenant-general, admiral of Holland, is obliged to go on board of a Rotterdam ſhip in the Maeſe when he goes to ſea, and then he commands the ſquadron of the Maeſe.</p><p>On the eaſt fide of the city there is a large baſon and dock, where ſhip-carpenters are continually employed for the uſe of the admiralty, or of the Eaſt India company. But the largeſt ſhips belonging to the admiralty ot Rotterdam are kept at Helvoetſluys, as the moſt commodious ſtation, that place being ſituated on the ocean ; for it requires both time and trouble to work a large ſhip from the dock of Rotterdam to the ſea.</p><p>Rotterdam has four Dutch churches for the eſta-hhſhed religion. There is one thing very remarkable</p></body></text></TEI>
