But as the opinions of geographers are extremely various concerning the ſituation and extent of moſt of the inland countries of Aſiaand Africa, neither the extent nor boundaries of Siam are yet accurately known. By ſome it is ſuppoſed to extend 553 miles in length, and 250 miles in breadth ; in ſome places it is not above 50 miles broad.</p><p>The winds blow here from the ſouth upon the coaſt of Siam, in March, April, and May ; in April the rains begin, in May and June they fall almoſt without ceasing. In July, Auguſt, and September, the winds blow from the west, and the rains continuing, the rivers overflow their banks nine or ten miles on each ſide, and for more than 150 miles up the ſtream. At this time, and more particularly in July, the tides are ſo ſtrong as to come up the river Menan as far as the city of Siam, which is ſituated 60 miles from its mouth ; and ſometimes as far as Louvo, which is 50 miles higher. The winds blow from the west and north in October, when the rain ceaſes. In November and December the winds blow dry from the north, and the waters being in a few days reduced to their ancient channels, the tides become ſo inſenſible, that the water is freſh at the mouth of the river. At Siam there is never more than one flood and one ebb in the ſpace of 24 hours. In January the wind blows from the eaſt, and in February from the eaſt and ſouth. When the wind is at eaſt, the current ſets to the west ; and, on the contrary, when the wind is at west, the currents run to the eaſtward.</p><p>As this country is ſituated near the tropic, it muſt neceſſarily be very hot ; but yet, as in other places nearly of the ſame latitude, when the ſun is vertical and ſhines with a moſt intenſe heat, the inhabitants are ſcreened by the clouds, and the air is ſo refreſhed by a deluge of rain that overflows the plains which the people chiefly inhabit, that the heat is very supportable. The cooleſt wind blows in December and January.</p><p>The vegetable produce of this country is chiefly rice and wheat, beſides tropical and a few European fruits. The Siameſe prepare the land for tillage as ſoon as the earth is ſufficiently moiſtened by the floods. They plant their rice before the waters riſe to any conſiderable height, and, as they riſe ſlowly, the rice keeps pace with them, and the ear is always above the water. They reap their corn when the water retires, and ſometimes go in boats to cut it while the waters are upon the ground. They alſo ſow rice in ſeveral parts of the kingdom that are not overflowed, and this is thought better taſted, and will keep longer, than the other ; but they are forced to ſupply theſe fields conſtantly with water, while the rice is growing, from baſins and ponds that lie about them.</p><p>They have no European fruits except oranges, lemons, citrons, and pomegranates. They have bananas, Indian figs, jaques, durions, mangoes, mangoſtans, tamarinds, ananas, and cocoa-nuts ; they have alſo abundance of pepper and ſugar-canes. The mountains are covered with trees which make good masts. The vegetable of greateſt uſe in the country is the bamboo, which grows chiefly in marſhy ſoils, and is often found of a prodigious ſize. Cotton trees are found in great numbers ; and others that yield <hi rend="italic">capoc,</hi> a very fine cotton wool, but ſo ſhort as to be unfit for spinning, though it anſwers very well for fluffing mattreſſes and pillows.</p><p>There is no country where elephants abound more than in Siam, or where they are held in greater veneration. They have a few horſes, sheep, and goats, beſides oxen and buffaloes ; but they have no good animal food except the fleſh of hogs, their beef and mutton being of a very indifferent quality.</p><p>The Siameſe are of ſmall flature, but well proportioned ; their complexions are ſwarthy : the faces of both the men and women are broad, and their foreheads, ſuddenly contracting, terminate in a point, as well as their chins. They have ſmall black eyes, hollow jaws, large mouths, and thick pale lips. Their teeth are dyed black, their noſes are ſhort and round at the end, and they have large ears, which they think very beautiful. Their hair is thick and lank, and both ſexes cut it ſo ſhort that it reaches no lower than their ears ; the women make it ſtand up on their foreheads ; and the men ſhave their beards.</p><p>People of diſtinction wear a piece of calico tied about their loins, that reaches down to their knees.— The men bring up this cloth between their legs, and tuck it into their girdles, which gives it the appearance of a pair of breeches. They have alſo a muſlin ſhirt without a collar, with wide ſleeves, no wriſtbands, and the boſom open. In winter they wear a piece of fluff or painted linen over their ſhoulders, like a mantle, and wind it about their arms.</p><p>The king of Siam is diſtinguiſhed by wearing a veſt of brocaded ſatin, with flraight ſleeves that reach down to the wriſt, under ſuch a ſhirt as we have juſt deſcribed, and it is unlawful for any ſubject to wear this dreſs unleſs he receives it from the king. They wear flippers with piked toes turned up, but no stockings. The king ſometimes preſents a military veſt to the generals ; this is buttoned before, and reaches to the knees ; but the ſleeves are wide, and come no lower than the elbows. All the retinue of the king, either in war or in hunting, are clothed in red. The king wears a cap in the form of a ſugar-loaf, encompaſſed by a coronet or circle of precious ſtones, and thoſe of his officers have a circle of gold, ſilver, or of vermilion gilt, to diſtinguiſh their quality ; and theſe caps are fattened with a flay under the chin ; they are only worn when they are in the king’s preſence, or when they preſide in courts of juſtice, and on other extraordinary occaſions. They have alſo hats for travelling ; but, in general, few people cover their heads notwithſtanding the ſcorching heat of the ſun.</p><p>The women alſo wrap a cloth about their middle, which hangs down to the calf of their legs. They cover their breaſts with another cloth, the ends of which hang over their ſhoulders. But they have no garment</p></body></text></TEI>
