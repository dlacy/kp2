<p><span class="font0">necessity, this pope became the most potent personage in Rome. Power fell naturally into his hands; he was the true representative of the city, the born defender of church and- state. His&nbsp;ecclesiastical authority, already great throughout Italy, was&nbsp;specially great in the Roman diocese and in southern Italy.&nbsp;The continual offerings of the faithful had previously endowed&nbsp;the church with enormous possessions in the province of Rome,&nbsp;in Sicily, Sardinia and other parts. The administration of all&nbsp;this property soon assumed the shape of a small government&nbsp;council in Rome. In the middle ages the owner of the land&nbsp;was also master of the men who cultivated it, and exercised&nbsp;political authority as well; these administrators therefore&nbsp;protected and succoured the oppressed, settled disputes, nominated judges and controlled the ecclesiastical authorities. The&nbsp;use made by the pope of his revenues greatly contributed&nbsp;to the increase of his moral and political authority. When&nbsp;the city was besieged by the Lombards, and the emperor left&nbsp;his army unpaid, Gregory supplied the required funds and&nbsp;thus made resistance possible. And, when the defence could&nbsp;be no longer maintained, he alone, by the weight of his personal&nbsp;influence and the payment of large sums, induced the Lombards to raise the siege. He negotiated in person with Agilulph,&nbsp;and was recognized by him as the true representative of the&nbsp;city. Thus Rome, after being five times taken and sacked&nbsp;by the barbarians, was, on this occasion, saved by its bishop.&nbsp;The exarch, although unable to give any help, protested against&nbsp;the assumption of so much authority by the pope; but Gregory&nbsp;was no usurper; his attitude was the natural result of events.&nbsp;“ For twenty-seven years ”•—so wrote this pontiff to the imperial government of Constantinople—“ we lived in terror of&nbsp;the Longobards, nor can I say what sums we had to pay them.&nbsp;There is an imperial treasurer with the army at Ravenna;&nbsp;but here it is I who am treasurer. Likewise I have to provide&nbsp;for the clergy, the poor and the people, and even to succour&nbsp;the distress of other churches.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was at this moment that the new Roman commune began to take shape and acquire increasing vigour owing to its distance from the seat of the empire and its resistance&nbsp;to the Lombard besiegers. Its special character&nbsp;was now to be traced in the preponderance of the&nbsp;military over the civil power. ‘A Roman element had penetrated into the army, which was already possessed of considerable political importance. The prefect of Rome loses&nbsp;authority and seems almost a nullity compared with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">magister&nbsp;militum.</span><span class="font0"> Hardly anything is heard of the senate. “ Quia&nbsp;enim Senatus deest, populus interiit,” exclaims Gregory in a&nbsp;moment of despair. The popes now make common cause with&nbsp;the people against the Lombards on the one hand and the&nbsp;emperor on the other. But they avoid an absolute rupture&nbsp;with the empire, lest they should have to face the Lombard&nbsp;power without any prospect of help. Later, when the growing&nbsp;strength of the commune becomes menacing, they remain&nbsp;faithful to the empire in order not to be at the mercy of the&nbsp;people. It was a permanent feature of their policy never to&nbsp;allow the complete independence of the city until they should&nbsp;be its sole and absolute masters. But that time was still in&nbsp;the future. Meanwhile pope and people joined in the defence</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of their common interests.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This alliance was cemented by the religious disputes of the East and the West. First came the Monothelite controversy&nbsp;regarding the twofold nature of Christ. Later a long and&nbsp;violent struggle ensued, in which the people of Rome and of&nbsp;other Italian cities sided so vigorously with the popes that&nbsp;John VI. (701-5) had to interpose in order to release the&nbsp;exarch from captivity and prevent a definitive rupture with&nbsp;the empire. Then (710-n) Ravenna revolted against the&nbsp;emperor, organized its armed population under twelve flags,&nbsp;and almost all the cities of the exarchate joined in a resistance&nbsp;that was the first step towards the independence of the Italian&nbsp;communes. A still fiercer religious quarrel then broke out&nbsp;concerning images. Pope Gregory II. (715-31) opposed the&nbsp;celebrated edict of the iconoclastic emperor Leo the Isaurian.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Venice and the Pentapolis took up arms in favour of the pope, and elected dukes of their own without applying to the emperor.&nbsp;Again public disorder rose to such a pitch that the pope was&nbsp;obliged to check it lest it should go too far.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the midst of these warlike tumults a new constitution, almost a new state, was being set up in Rome. During the&nbsp;conflict with Philippicus, the Monothelite and heretical&nbsp;emperor who ascended the throne in 711, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liber&nbsp;Pontificalis</span><span class="font0"> makes the first mention of the duchy&nbsp;of Rome </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(ducatus Romanae urbis),</span><span class="font0"> and we find the&nbsp;people struggling to elect a duke of their own. In the early&nbsp;days of the Byzantine rule the territory appertaining to the&nbsp;city was no greater than under the Roman Empire. But,&nbsp;partly through the weakness of the government of Constantinople, and above all through the decomposition of the Italian&nbsp;provinces under the Lombards, who destroyed all unity of&nbsp;government in the peninsula, this dukedom was widely extended, and its limits were always changing in accordance with&nbsp;the course of events. It was watered by the Tiber, and stretched&nbsp;into Tuscia to the right, starting from the mouth of the Marta,&nbsp;by Tolfa and Bleda, and reaching as far as Orte. Viterbo&nbsp;was a frontier city of the Lombards. On the left the duchy&nbsp;extended into Latium as far as the Garigliano. It spread very&nbsp;little to the north-east and was badly defended on that side,&nbsp;inasmuch as the duchy of Spoleto reached to within fourteen&nbsp;miles of the Salara gate. On the other side, towards Umbria,&nbsp;the river Nera was its boundary line.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The constitution of the city now begins to show the results of the conditions amid which it took shape. The separation&nbsp;of the civil from the military power has entirely disappeared. This is proved by the fact that, after the&nbsp;year 600, there is no further mention of the prefect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His office still survived, but with a gradual change of functions, until, in the 8th century, he once more&nbsp;appears as president of a criminal tribunal. The constitution of the duchy and of the new republic formed during&nbsp;the wars with the Lombards and the exarch was substantially&nbsp;of an aristocratico-military nature. At its head was the duke,&nbsp;first appointed by the emperor, then by the pope and the&nbsp;people, and, as his strength and influence grew with those of&nbsp;the commune, he gradually became the most respected and&nbsp;powerful personage in Rome. The duke inhabited the palace&nbsp;of the Caesars on the Palatine Hill, and had both the civil and the&nbsp;military power in his hands; he was at the head of the army,&nbsp;which, being composed of the best citizens and highest nobility&nbsp;of Rome, was a truly national force. This army was styled the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">felicissimus</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">florens exercitus Romanns</span><span class="font0"> or also the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">militia&nbsp;Romana.</span><span class="font0"> Its members never lost their citizen stamp; on the&nbsp;contrary they formed the true body of the citizens. We find&nbsp;mention of other </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duces</span><span class="font0"> in Rome, but these were probably other&nbsp;leaders or superior officers of the army. Counts and tribunes&nbsp;are found in the subject cities bound to furnish aid to the&nbsp;capital. In fact during the pontificate of Sergius II. (844),&nbsp;when the duchy was threatened by a Saracenic invasion, they&nbsp;were requested to send troops to defend the coast, and as many&nbsp;soldiers as possible to the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At that time the inhabitants of Rome were divided into four principal classes—clergy, nobles, soldiers and simple citizens.&nbsp;The nobles were divided into two categories, first the&nbsp;genuine </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">optimates, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> members of old and wealthy&nbsp;families with large estates, and filling high, and often&nbsp;hereditary, offices in the state, the church and the&nbsp;army. These were styled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">proceres</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">primates.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;second category comprised landed proprietors, of moderate&nbsp;means but exalted position, mentioned as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">nobiles</span><span class="font0"> by Gregory I.,&nbsp;and constituting in fact a numerous petty nobility and the bulk&nbsp;of the army. Next followed the citizen?, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> the commercial&nbsp;class, merchants and craftsmen, who, having as yet no fixed&nbsp;organization and but little influence, were simply designated&nbsp;as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">honesti cives.</span><span class="font0"> These, however, were quite distinct from the&nbsp;plebeians, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">plebs, vulgus popidi, viri humiles,</span><span class="font0"> who in their turn&nbsp;ranked above bondsmen and slaves. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">honesti cives</span><span class="font0"> did not</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
