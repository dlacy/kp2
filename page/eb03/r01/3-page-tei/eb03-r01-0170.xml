Now, granting they will, ſhall one ſet of particles be bound for the crimes, or be entitled to receive the rewards, of the animal ſyſtem, ſrom its firſt commencement to its diffolution ? or ſhall every particle ∏fe up ſucceſſively, and receive its dividend of rewards and puniſhments for the vices and virtues that belonged' to the ſyſtern during the time that they were in union with the ſentient principle ? and is the hand that fell in defending a father to be (as is ſuppoſed in ſome of the eaſtern countries) rewarded in heaven ; while the other that ftruck him when the ſon became vicious, is diſmiffed into torments ?</p><p>Finding this hypotheſis ſupported by neither Scripture nor reaſon, they next appeal to the ancient fathers.

Theſe puniſhments ſome have ſuppoſed to be everlaſting ; others think, that after ſome temporary puniſhment, the fouls, of the wicked are to be annihilated ; and others imagine, that after doing purgatorial penance for a while in hell, they are to be again received into favour ; inclining to ex-plain the denunciations of the Almighty as a child would do the threatenings of his mother, or a lover the affected chidings of his miftreſs (a).</p><p>RESUSCITATION, the fame with refurrection and revivification.

It is placed im-mediately under the cuticle; and when that is ſeparated from the cutis, whether by art or accident, this adheres firmly to it, and is fcarce poſſible to be parted from it, ſeeming rather to bc its inner fuperficies than a diſtinct ſubſtance. In regard to this, we are to obſerve, firſt, the places in which it is found, being all thoſe in which the ſenſe of feeling is moſt acute, as in the palms of the hands, the extremities of the fingers, and on the ſoles of the feet. The tongue, however, is the part where it is moſt accurately to be obſerved : it is more eaſily diſtinguiſhable there than anywhere elſe,: and its nature and ſtructure are moſt evidently ſeen there.</p><p>Its colour in the Europeans is white ; but in the ne-groes and other black nations it is black ; in the tawny-it is yellowiſht the ſkin itſelf in both is white; and the. blackneſs and yellowneſs depend altogether on the co-lour of this membrane.</p><p>The ufes of the corpus reticulare are to preſerve the ſtructure of the other parts of the integuments, and? keep them in their determinate form and fituation. Its. apertures give paffage to the hairs and ſweat through the papillae and excretory ducts of the ſkin : it retains» theſe in a certain and determinate order, that they cannot be removed out of their places, and has ſome· ſhare in preſerving the ſoftneſs of the papille, which renders them fit for the ſenſe of feeling.

Since this article went to the preſs, however, we have learned, from the moſt reſpectable authority, that wild and abſurd as the opinion is, it has been induſtriouſly propagated in this country, and that in ſome places it has gained ground. The conſequences of this, were it to become general, muſt indeed be baneful beyond all conception; and we ſhall afterwards take occafion to expoſe the opinion and its nefarious conſequences at greater length than it is now poſſible to do in this place.
