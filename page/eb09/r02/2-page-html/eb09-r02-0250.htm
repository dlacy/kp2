<p><span class="font1">phrases </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">légitima cognatio, légitima hxreditas, legitimi heredes, tutela légitima, iutores legitimi</span><span class="font1"> themselves proclaim the&nbsp;origin of agnation, agnatic inheritance, and agnatic tutory ;&nbsp;for, though the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">legitimus</span><span class="font1"> might be applied to any institution based on statute, yet in the ordinary case it indicated one introduced by the XII. Tables, the law of laws.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A man’s agnates were those of his kinsmen who were subject to the same </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font1"> as himself, or would&nbsp;have been had the common ancestor been still alive. A&nbsp;man’s sons and daughters </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in pole state,</span><span class="font1"> therefore, whether&nbsp;the relationship was by birth or adoption, and his wife </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in&nbsp;manu</span><span class="font1"> (being </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">filiae loco)</span><span class="font1"> were each other’s agnates. But a&nbsp;wife not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in manu</span><span class="font1"> was not their agnate ; nor were children&nbsp;who had been emancipated or otherwise </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capite minuti</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;agnates of either their brothers and sisters or their mother&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in manu.</span><span class="font1"> A man was an agnate of his brother’s children,&nbsp;assuming always that there had been no </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">capitis deminutio&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">on either side ; but he was not an agnate of his sister’s&nbsp;children, for they were not </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ejusdem familiae</span><span class="font1"> : they were&nbsp;agnates of their father’s family, not of their mother’s. In&nbsp;like manner, and again assuming the absence of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">minutio&nbsp;capitis,</span><span class="font1"> the children of brothers were each other’s agnates,&nbsp;but not the children of a brother and a sister or of two&nbsp;sisters. Brothers and sisters were agnates of the second&nbsp;degree;</span><span class="font0">@@</span><span class="font1"><sup>1</sup> a man and his brother’s children were of the third,&nbsp;the children of two brothers </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(consobrini)</span><span class="font1"> of the fourth,&nbsp;and so on,—it being a condition, however, that the kinship&nbsp;should always result either from lawful marriage or from&nbsp;adoption in one or other of its forms.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When, therefore, a man died leaving pupil male descendants or unmarried female descendants who by his death became swi juris,&nbsp;they got their brothers of lawful age as their tutors ; if he was survived by his wife, and she had been in manu, her sons, or it might&nbsp;be stepsons, acted for her in the same capacity ; in either case they&nbsp;took office as the nearest qualified male agnates. If the widow had&nbsp;no sons or stepsons of full age, and the children consequently no&nbsp;brothers, the tutory devolved on the agnates next in order,—ix.,&nbsp;the brothers germane and consanguinean of the deceased husband&nbsp;and father ; for they were agnates of the third degree. And so&nbsp;with agnates of the fourth and remoter degrees. Failing agnates&nbsp;who could demonstrate their propinquity, the tutory probably&nbsp;passed to the gens when the ward happened to belong to one. This&nbsp;is nowhere expressly stated ; but Cicero gives what he represents&nbsp;to be an enactment of the Tables, making the fellow-gentiles of a&nbsp;lunatic his guardians on failure of agnates ; and analogy seems to&nbsp;justify the extension of the same rule to the case of sane pupil&nbsp;and female wards.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The curatory of minors above pupilarity was of much later date than the Tables. The only curatories they&nbsp;sanctioned were those of lunatics and spendthrifts. A&nbsp;lunatic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(juriosus)</span><span class="font1"> was committed to the care of his agnates,&nbsp;and, failing them, of his fellow-gentiles ; and a few words&nbsp;in Festus seem to suggest that arrangements had to be&nbsp;made by them for his safe custody.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Mancipation and the Law of Property.—</span><span class="font1">In the early law there was no technical word for ownership of things ; it&nbsp;was an element of the house-father’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">manus.</span><span class="font1"> In time,&nbsp;although it is impossible to say when, the word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dominium&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">came into use ; but, so far as can be discovered, it did not&nbsp;occur in the XII. Tables, and must have been of later&nbsp;introduction. In those days, when a man asserted ownership of a thing, he was content to say, “ It is mine,” or,&nbsp;“ It is mine according to the law of the Quirites.” The&nbsp;distinction was this, that, while the first was sufficient to&nbsp;entitle a man </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">de facto</span><span class="font1"> holding a thing as his own to protection against a thief or any one attempting forcibly to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">dispossess him, the second was necessary when he appealed to a court of law to declare the legality of his title and&nbsp;his right to oust an individual withholding the possession&nbsp;neither theftuously nor by force. It is said by some jurists&nbsp;of eminence that under the law of the Tables what afterwards came to be called “dominium ex jure Quiritium” was&nbsp;competent only in the case of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi,—</span><span class="font1">of a man’s&nbsp;house and farm, and the slaves and animals with which he&nbsp;worked them. But the usucapion (or acquisition by prolonged possession) which they confirmed and regulated&nbsp;undoubtedly conferred quiritarian right ; and, as it applied&nbsp;to all things ownable without exception, it seems impossible&nbsp;to maintain that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res nee mancipi</span><span class="font1"> could not then be held in&nbsp;quiritarian ownership as fully as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The modes in which these two classes of things might be acquired in property were very various. But there&nbsp;was this important difference,—that, while a natural&nbsp;mode of acquisition sufficed in the case of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">some civil one was necessary for the derivative acquisition,&nbsp;at all events, of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi.</span><span class="font1"> The most important λvere&nbsp;mancipation, surrender in court, usucapion, and bequest&nbsp;as singular modes, and inheritance, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">in manum conventiο,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">adrogation, and purchase of a confiscated estate as universal modes. All these, with the exception of mancipation,&nbsp;applied equally to </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi.</span><span class="font1"> But the commonest&nbsp;of all the modes of transferring things of the latter class&nbsp;was simple tradition. If the transfer was by the owner,&nbsp;with the intention of passing the property, then the simple&nbsp;delivery of possession was enough, unless it was in virtue&nbsp;of a sale ; in such a case, and because a vendor had as&nbsp;yet no action for the price, the Tables provided that the&nbsp;ownership should remain with him, notwithstanding the&nbsp;change of possession, until the price was paid or security&nbsp;given for it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The origin of the distinction between mancipable and non-man-cipable things, and of the form of conveyance by mancipation applicable to the first, has been explained in connexion with the&nbsp;reforms of Servius Tullius Gupra, p. 676).@@<sup>2</sup> As he introduced it,&nbsp;mancipation (then called mαηripiurn) was not the imaginary sale&nbsp;that Gaius speaks of, but as real a sale as could well be conceived,&nbsp;—the weighing in scales, held by an official, of the raw metal that&nbsp;was to be the consideration for the transfer of a res mancipi, and&nbsp;the handing of it by the transferee to the transferrer, with the declaration that thereby and therewith the thing in question became&nbsp;his in quiritary right,—and all this in words of style, and in the&nbsp;presence of certain witnesses who represented the people, and thus&nbsp;fortified the conveyance with a public sanction. As already shown,&nbsp;there is some reason to believe that, when large quantities of metal&nbsp;had to be weighed, the practice crept in of having this done before&nbsp;the witnesses had assembled ; and in the formal act only a single&nbsp;pound was weighed as representing the whole amount. This paved&nbsp;the way for the greater change that resulted from the introduction&nbsp;by the decemvirs of coined money. From that moment weighing&nbsp;became unnecessary. The price was counted out before the ceremony, and sometimes left to be done afterwards ; and, though, in&nbsp;that spirit of conservatism that was so marked in the adhesion to&nbsp;time-honoured forms after their raison d' être was gone, the scale-bearer and the scales were still retained as indispensable elements&nbsp;of the mancipation, yet the scales were simply touched by the purchaser with a single coin, in order that he might be able to recite&nbsp;the old formula—“I say that this slave is mine in quiritary right,&nbsp;and that by purchase (for such and such a price ?) with these scales&nbsp;and this bit of copper.” And that one coin, says Gaius, was then&nbsp;handed by the transferee to the transferrer, as if it were in fact the&nbsp;price of the purchase (quasi ρretii loco). Thus transformed, the&nbsp;mancipation was undoubtedly an imaginary sale ; for the real price&nbsp;might have been paid weeks or months before, or might not be paid&nbsp;until weeks or months afterwards. The mancipation had become&nbsp;nothing more than a conveyance, and in this form it continued&nbsp;down to the end of the 3d century of the empire to be the appropriate mode of transfer of a res mancipi, or at least of conferring on&nbsp;the transferee of such a thing a complete legal title (dominium ex&nbsp;jure Quiritium). After that, however, it seems gradually to have&nbsp;gone into disuse, being inapplicable to lands out of Italy that did</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">ance from the XII. Tables was specially noticed by Dauz in his Gesch. d. rom. Rechts, 2d ed., Leipsic, 1871-73, vol. ii. p. 95, but&nbsp;is generally ignored.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">@@@<sup>1</sup> To determine the degree of propinquity between two persons it was necessary to count the generations upwards from the first to the&nbsp;common ancestor and downwards from him to the second. Consequently brothers were related in the second degree, uncle and nephew&nbsp;in the third, first cousins in the fourth, and so on : “ tot gradus quot&nbsp;generationes. ”</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
