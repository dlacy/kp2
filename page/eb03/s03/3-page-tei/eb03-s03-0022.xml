Moſt of the ſtreets are crooked and dirty, the houſes wooden and very wretched; nor do the inhabitants appear much the richer for their cloth manufactory. Indeed, it is not in a very flouriſhing condition, but what cloth they make is very ſine.</p><p>The country about Segovia has the reputation of being the beſt for rearing the kind of ſheep that produces the beautiful Spaniſh wool; but as thoſe flocks wander over many other parts of the kingdom, Segovia ſeems to have no excluſive title to this reputation. Segovia (ſays Townſend, whoſe valuable travels will be read with much pleaſure) was once famous for its cloth made on the king’s account; but other nations have ſince become rivals in this branch, and the manufacture in this city has been gradually declining. When the king gave it up to a private company, he left about 3000 l in trade; but now he is no huger a partner in the buſineſs. In the year 1612 were made here 25,500 pieces of cloth, which conſumed 44,625 quintals of wool, employed 34,189 persons; but at preſent they make only about 4000 pieces. The principal imperfections of this cloth are, that the thread is not even, and that much greaſe remains in it when it is delivered to the dyer; in conſequence of which the colour is apt to fail. Yet, independently of imperfections, ſo many are the diſadvantages under which the manufacture labours, that foreigners can afford to pay 3 l. for the arroba of fine wool, for which the Spaniard gives no more than 20 ſhillings, and after all his charges can command the market even in the ports of Spain.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Segovia</hi> (New), a town of North America, in New Spain, and in the audience of Guatimala; ſeated on the river Yare, on the confines of the province of Honduras.

His father’s name was Seius Strabo; a Roman knight, commander of the pretorian guards. His mother was deſcended from the Junian family. Sejanus firſt gained the favours of Caius Cæſar, the grandſon of Auguſtus, but afterwards he attached himſelf to the intereſt and the views of Tiberius, who then ſat on the imperial throne. The emperor, who was naturally of a ſuſpicious temper, was free and open with Sejanus, and while he diſtruſted others, he communicated his greateſt ſecrets to this fawning favourite. Sejanus improved this confidence; and when he had found that he poſſeſſed the eſteem of Tiberius, he next endeavoured to become the favourite of the ſoldiers, and the darling of the ſenate. As commander of the pretorian guards he was the ſecond man in Rome, and in that important office he made uſe of inſinuations and every mean artifice to make himſelf beloved and revered. His affability and condeſcenſion gained him the hearts of the common ſoldiers, and, by appointing his own favourites and adherents to places of truſt and honour, all the officers and centurions of the army became devoted to his intereſt. The views of Sejanus in this were well known; yet, to advance with more ſucceſs, he attempted to gain the affection of the ſenators. In this he met with no oppoſition. A man who has the diſpoſal of places of honour and dignity, and who has the command of the public money, cannot but be the favourite of thoſe who are in need of his aſſiſtance. It is even ſaid, that Sejanus gained to his views all the wives of the ſenators, by a private and moſt ſecret promiſe of marriage to each of them, whenever he had made himſelf independent and ſovereign of Rome. Yet, however ſucceſsful with the beſt and nobleſt families in the empire, Sejanus had to combat numbers in the houſe of the emperor; but theſe ſeeming obſtacles were ſoon removed. All the children and grandchildren of Tiberius were ſacrificed to the ambition of the favourite under various pretences; and Druſus the ſon of the emperor, by ſtriking Sejanus, made his deſtruction ſure and inevitable. Livia, the wife of Druſus, was gained by Sejanus; and, though the mother of many children, ſhe was prevailed upon to aſſiſt her adulterer in the murder of her huſband, and</p><p>ſhe conſented to marry him when Druſus was dead. No ſooner was Druſus poiſoned, than Sejanus openly declared his wiſh to marry Livia. This was ſtrongly oppoſed by Tiberius; and the emperor, by recommending Germanicys to the ſenators for his ſucceſſor, rendered Sejanus hold and determined. He was more urgent in his demands; and when he could not gain the conſent of the emperor, he perſuaded him to retire to ſolitude from the noiſe of Rome and the troubles of the government.  Tiberius, naturally fond of eaſe and luxury, yielded to his repreſentations and retired to Campania, leaving Sejanus at the head of the empire. This was highly gratifying to the favourite, but he was not without a maſter. Prudence and moderation might have made him what he wiſhed to be; but having offended the emperor beyond forgiveneſs, he reſolved to retrieve his loſs, and by one vigorous effort to decide the fate of the empire. He called together his friends and followers; he paid</p></body></text></TEI>
