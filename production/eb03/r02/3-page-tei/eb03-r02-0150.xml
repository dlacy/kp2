This prophecy, however, the ſenate found means to elude, as they pretended, by burying two Gauls and two Greeks alive, and then telling the multitude that the Gauls and Greeks were now in the poſſeſſion of Rome. The difficulties which ſuperſtition had raiſed being thus ſurmounted, the Romans made vaſt preparations againſt the Gauls, whom they ſeem to have dreaded above all other nations. Some ſay that the number of forces raiſed by the Romans on this occaſion amounted to no fewer than 8oo,ooc men. Of this incredible multitude 248,000 foot and 26,000 horſe were Romans or Campanians ; nevertheleſs, the Gauls, with only &lt;fo,ooo foot and 20,000 horſe, forced a paſſage through Hetruria, and took the road towards Rome. Here they had the good fortune at firſt to defeat one of the Roman armies; but being ſoon after met by two others, they were utterly defeated, with the loſs of more than 50,0co of their number. The Romans then entered their country, which they cruelly ravaged ; but a plague breaking out in their army, obliged them to return home. This was followed by a new war, in which thoſe Gauls who inhabited Inſubria and Liguria were totally ſubdued, and their country reduced to a Roman province. Theſe conqueſts were followed by that of Iſtria ; Dimalum, a city of importance in Illyricum ; and Pharos, an iſland in the Adriatic ſea.</p><p>The ſecond Punic war for ſome time retarded the conqueſts of the Romans, and even threatened their ſtate with entire deſtruction ; but Hannibal being at laſt recalled from Italy, and entirely defeated at Zama, they made peace upon ſuch advantageous terms as gave them an entire ſuperiority over that republic, which they not long after entirely ſubverted, as has been related in the hiſtory of <hi rend="smallcaps">Carthage.</hi></p><p>The ſucceſsful iſſue of the ſecond Punic war had greatly increaſed the extent of the Roman empire. They were now maſters of all Sicily, the Mediterranean iſlands, and great part of Spain ; and, through the diſſenſions of the Aſiatic ſtates with the king of Macedon, a pretence was now found for carrying their arms into theſe parts. The Gauls in the mean time, however, continued their incurſions, but now ceaſed to be formidable ; while the kings of Macedon, through miſconduct, were firſt obliged to ſubmit to a disadvantageous peace, and' at laſt totally ſubdued (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Macedon).</hi>  The reduction of Macedon was ſoon followed by that of all Greece, either by the name of allies or otherwiſe : while Antiochus the Great, to whom Hannibal fled for protection, by an unſucceſsful war firſt gave the Romans a footing in Aſia (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Syria).</hi>  The Spaniards and Gauls continued to be the moſt obſtinate enemies. The former, particularly, were rather exterminated than reduced ; and even this required the ut∙ moſt care and vigilance of Scipio Æmilianus; the conqueror of Garthage, to execute. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Spain</hi>  and Nc<hi rend="sup">τ</hi>-MANTIA.</p><p>Thus the Romans attained to a height of power fu-τ&gt;erior to any other nation in the world ; bfιt now a ſedition broke out, which we may ſay was never terminated but with the overthrow of the republic. This had its origin from Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus, deſcen-ded from a family which» though plebeian, was as illu^</p><lb/><p>ſtrious as any in the commonwealth. His father had been twice raiſed to the conſulate, was a great general, and had been honoured with two triumphs. But he was ſtill more renowned for his domeſtic virtues and pro· bity, than for his birth or valour. He married the daughter of the firſt Africanus, ſaid to be the pattern of her ſex, and the prodigy of her age ; and had by her ſeveral children, of whom three only arrived to maturity of age, Tiberius Gracchus, Caius Gracchus, and a daughter named <hi rend="italic">Sempronia,</hi>  who was married to the ſecond Africanus. Tiberius, the eldeſt, was deemed the moſt accompliſhed youth in Rome, with reſpect to the qualities both of body and mind. His extraordina∙ ry talents were heightened by a noble air, an engaging countenance, and all thoſe winning graces of nature which recommend merit. He made his firſt campaigns under his brother-in-law, and diſtinguiſhed himſelf on all occaſions h,y his courage, and by the prudence of his conduct. When he returned to Rome, he applied himſelf to the ſtudy of eloquence ; and at 30 years old was accounted the beſt orator of his age. He married the daughter of Appius Claudius, who had been formerly conſul and cenſor, and was then prince of the ſenate. He continued for ſome time in the ſentiments both of his own and his wife’s family, and ſupported the intereſts of the patricians ; but without openly attacking the popular faction. He was the chief author and negociator of that ſhameful neceſſary peace with the Numantines ; which the ſenate, with the utmoſt injuſtice, diſannulled, and condemned the conſul, the quæftor, and all the officers who had ſigned it, to be delivered up to the Numantines (ſee Nu <hi rend="smallcaps">manti a).</hi>  The people indeed, out of eſteem for Gracchus, would not ſuffer him to be ſacrificed : but, however, he had juſt reaſon to complain, both of the ſenate and people, for paſſing ſo ſcandalous a decree againſt his general and himſelf, and breaking a treaty whereby the lives of ſo many citizens had been ſaved. But as the ſenate</p><p>had chiefly promoted ſuch baſe and iniquitous proceedings, he reſolved in due time to ſhow his refent-ment againſt the party which had contributed moſt to his diſgrace.</p><p>In order to this, he ſtood for the tribuneſhip of the people ; which he no ſooner obtained, than he reſolved to attack the nobility in the moſt tender part. They had uſurped lands unjuſtly ; cultivated them by ſlaves, to the great detriment of the public ; and had lived for about 250 years in open defiance to the Licinian law, by which it was enacted that no citizen ſhould poſſeſs more than 500 acres. This law Tib. Gracchus reſoL ved to revive, and by that means revenge himſelf on the patricians. But it was not revenge alone which prompted him to embark in ſo dangerous an attempt, It is pretended, that his mother Cornelia animated him to undertake ſomething worthy both of his and her family. The reproaches of his mother, the authority of ſome great men, namely of his father-in-law Appius Claudius,, of P. Craſſns the <hi rend="italic">pontifex maximus,</hi>  and of Mutius Scævola, the moſt learned civilian in Rome, and his natural thrift after glory, joined with an eager deſire of revenge, conſpired to draw him into this moſt unfortunate ſeheme.</p><p>The law, as he firſt drew it up, was very mild : for it only enacted, that thoſe who poſſeſſed more than çoo acres of land ſhould part with the overplus ; and that</p><lb/></body></text></TEI>
