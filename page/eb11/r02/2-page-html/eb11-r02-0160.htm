<p><span class="font2">conditions were not maintained long enough to ensure the complete arrest of the disease.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Instead of the tuberculous focus becoming arrested, it may continue to spread. The original focus and the secondary&nbsp;ones are at first patches of consolidated lung. Later, their&nbsp;central parts soften and burst into a bronchus; then the&nbsp;softened portion is coughed up, and a smalI cavity is left,&nbsp;which tends gradually to increase in size by peripheric extension and by merging with other cavities. This process is&nbsp;repeated again and again, and sooner or later the other lung&nbsp;becomes similarly affected. At any stage of the softening&nbsp;process the blood vessels may become involved and give rise&nbsp;by rupture to a large or a small haemorrhage </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(haemoptysis).&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">It not unfrequently happens that such haemoptysis may&nbsp;be the first symptom that seriously attracts attention. At a&nbsp;later period haemorrhage frequently takes place in large or&nbsp;small amounts from the rupture of vessels, which frequently&nbsp;are dilated and form small aneurysms in the walls of cavities.&nbsp;A fatal termination may be hastened by the absorption by&nbsp;means of the blood vessels and lymphatics of the tuberculous&nbsp;virus from some of the foci of disease, and the occurrence&nbsp;therefrom of a Iocal miliary tuberculosis of the lungs or a&nbsp;general tuberculosis of other organs. Thc rapidity with which&nbsp;the destructive process spreads throughout the lung varies considerably. We therefore recognize acute phthisis, or galloping&nbsp;consumption, and chronic phthisis. In the acute cases the softening progresses rapidly and is associated with the development&nbsp;of very little fibrous tissue; probably various forms of microorganisms other than the tubercle bacilli assist in the rapid&nbsp;softening. In the more chronic cases there is development&nbsp;of much fibroid tissue, and the disease is associated with periods&nbsp;of temporary arrest of the tubercular process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The expectoration from cases of pulmonary phthisis contains tubercle bacilli, and is a source of danger to healthy individuals,&nbsp;in whom it may produce the disease. Attendance on persons&nbsp;suffering from pulmonary phthisis involves very little risk of&nbsp;infection if proper care, is taken to prevent the expectoration becoming dry and disseminated as dust; perfect.cleanliness is therefore to be insisted upon, in the rooms inhabited by a phthisical&nbsp;person. The tubercle bacilli soon lose their virulence in the presence&nbsp;of fresh air and sunshine, and therefore these agents are not only&nbsp;desirable for the direct-benefit of the phthisical patient, but also&nbsp;are agents in preventing the development of fresh disease in healthy&nbsp;individuals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Although the tubercle bacilli are the essential agents in the development of pulmonary tuberculosis., there are other conditions&nbsp;which must be present before they will produce the disease. It&nbsp;is probable that large numbers of individuals are exposed to the&nbsp;action of tubercle bacilli which gain entrance to the pulmonary&nbsp;tract, and yet do not give rise to the disease, because the conditions&nbsp;of their growth and multiplication do not exist. In such cases we&nbsp;may consider that the seed is present, but that the soil is unsuitable for its growth. Certain families appear more predisposed to&nbsp;tuberculosis than others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The most important HrcuIatory disturbances met with in the lungs are those seen in cases of dilated heart, with or without disease of the mitral valve, when engorgement&nbsp;of the pulmonary vessels sets up a condition of venous&nbsp;engorgement of the lungs. This may lead to various&nbsp;changes. After it has lasted a variable time, and if it is very&nbsp;intense, serous transudation occurs into the substance of the&nbsp;lung and the alveoli, and thus a condition of pulmonary dropsy&nbsp;or oedema is established. The venous engorgement also predisposes the subjects of such heart affections to bronchitis&nbsp;and pneumonia. In disease of the mitral valve, in cardiac&nbsp;dilatation and in simple feebleness of the heart, such as is&nbsp;seen in old age and after debilitating fevers, especially typhoid,&nbsp;there is commonly developed a venous congestion of the bases&nbsp;of the lungs, forming the so-called hypostatic congestion of&nbsp;those organs, and to this is frequently added pneumonia.&nbsp;In long-standing cases of pulmonary congestion brought about&nbsp;by disease of the mitral valve and dilatation of the heart,&nbsp;a certain amount of fibrous tissue may be found in the interstitial tissue of the lungs, and from transudation of certain&nbsp;elements of the blood we get the formation in the newly formed&nbsp;fibrous tissue of blood pigment. In these cases blood pigment&nbsp;is found in the ceUs, in the pulmonary alveoli, and such cells&nbsp;also carry the pigment into the interstitial tissue. This condition constitutes the state known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">brown induration of the&nbsp;lungs.</span><span class="font2"> Acute congestion of the lungs occurs as part of the&nbsp;first stage of pneumonia. It also probably exists during&nbsp;violent exertion, and may possibly be brought about by&nbsp;excitement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Another circulatory disturbance of great importance is that arising from blocking of the pulmonary artery or its&nbsp;branches by an embolus or a thrombus. Where the&nbsp;obstruction takes place in the main vessel, death&nbsp;rapidly ensues. Where, however, a small branch of&nbsp;the vessel is occluded, as frequently occurs from a&nbsp;coagulum forming in the right side of the heart, or in the&nbsp;pulmonary vessels in cases of disease of the mitral valve,&nbsp;or in dilatation of the heart, or from the detachment of a&nbsp;small vegetation from disease of the tricuspid or pulmonary&nbsp;valves, a haemorrhagic exudation takes place, forming a&nbsp;patch of consolidation in the lung </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(haemorrhagic infarct).</span><span class="font2"> As&nbsp;this haemorrhagic exudation takes place not only into the&nbsp;substance of the lung, but also into the bronchial tubes, such&nbsp;lesions are usually associated with spitting of blood </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(haemoptysis).</span><span class="font2"> The increased tension produced in the pulmonary&nbsp;vessels in cases of mitral disease may also probably lead to&nbsp;the formation of haemorrhagic exudations into the lungs,&nbsp;apart from the occurrence of embolism or thrombosis. Usually&nbsp;the occurrence of pulmonary embolism and the formation of&nbsp;haemorrhagic infarcts in the lungs mark an important epoch&nbsp;in the course of a case of heart disease. It usually occurs&nbsp;at a late stage of the affection, and not unfrequently contributes materially to a fatal termination. It is probable that&nbsp;many of the cases of pneumonia and pleuritic effusion, coming&nbsp;on in cases of vaIvular heart disease and of cardiac dilatation,&nbsp;owe their origin to an embolus and to the formation of a haemorrhagic infarct.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The term asthma is commonly applied to a paroxysmal dyspnoea of a special type which is associated with a variety&nbsp;of conditions. In true spasmodic asthma there&nbsp;may be no detectable organic disease, and the paroxysms are generally believed to be due to a nervous influence&nbsp;which, acting upon the bronchial muscles, produces a spasm&nbsp;of the tubes, or, acting through the vaso-motor branches of&nbsp;the sympathetic, produces a congest ion of the bronchial mucous&nbsp;membrane. The most probable theory is that lately advanced,&nbsp;that it is caused by a profound toxaemia. An organism has&nbsp;been isolated, which is said to be the cause of certain cases of&nbsp;asthma, and the fact that benefit has been said to follow&nbsp;treatment by a vaccine is in favour of this view. The exciting&nbsp;cause may not be at all apparent, even on the most careful observation and examination of the sufferer, but in other cases the&nbsp;attacks may be brought about by some reflex irritation. Nasal&nbsp;polypi and other diseases of nasal mucous membrane have&nbsp;been shown in some cases to be a cause of asthma. Irritation&nbsp;of the bronchial mucous membrane appears to be one of the&nbsp;most common, but it is usually difficult to say exactly in what&nbsp;the irritation consists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The sputum in true asthma is typical, consisting of white translucent pellets like boiled tapioca. These pellets consist&nbsp;of mucus arranged in a twisted manner and known as Cursch-mann spirals; they also contain Charcot-Leyden crystals,&nbsp;degenerated epithelium and leucocytes, of which the majority&nbsp;are eosinophiles. The spirals consist of a central solid thread&nbsp;round which the mucus is arranged in spiral form. The twisting&nbsp;has been attributed to a rotatory motion of the cilia, helped by&nbsp;the spasm of thq bronchial muscles. Allied to true asthma is&nbsp;the bronchial asthma frequently met with in the subjects of&nbsp;bronchitis and emphysema. In such cases the irritation evidently proceeds from the inflamed bronchial mucous membrane.&nbsp;Hay asthma is the variety in which the pollen of certain plants,&nbsp;especially grasses, is the exciting cause of the paroxysms. In&nbsp;cardiac feebleness, in valvular disease of the heart, and in cardiac&nbsp;dilatation, we may get dyspnoeic attacks of a more or less</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
