Into particulars, therefore, we shall not enter ; only the most import ant transactions can be noticed. Disaffection to the <hi rend="italic">government</hi> in the southern provinces, where a strong body of French troops was stationed as a sanitary cordon during the prevalence of pestilence in Spain, terminated in open revolt. The national guards were called out to suppress it, and they were everywhere victorious ; but the pecuniary resources were chiefly in the hands of the supporters of despotism. In Madrid an occurrence took place in July 1822, which threatened the most disastrous consequences. This was a daring attempt of the friends of absolute government to overthrow the constitution. They were supported by the royal guards, while the national guards were ranged on the popular side. A conflict took place, in which nearly the whole of the royal guards were cut off. But insurrection, although thus suppressed in the capital, still prevailed to an alarming extent in Biscay, Navarre, and Catalonia, where armed bands, under the name of apostolical troops, <hi rend="italic">feotas,</hi> or soldiers of the faith, committed revolting cruelties. Near the French frontier, and probably under French influence, the absolutists appointed a regency, which issued orders in the name of the “ imprisoned” king, as they thought fit to call Ferdinand, although he had recently, under no compulsion, but in the most voluntary manner, again declared his adherence to the constitution. The avowed object of this regency was the restoration of every thing to the state in which it had been prior to the 7th of March 1820. But this band of outrageous serviles, unsupported by the nation, was compelled to fly to France in November 1822. The foreign relations of Spain now fell into a state of dreadful disorder ; and the principle of armed intervention pronounced by Austria, Russia, and Prussia, in relation to this unhappy kingdom, was threaten ed to be acted upon by France. The restoration of Ferdinand to the full enjoyment of sovereign authority was demanded by the four powers named, while England advised the Cortes to yield, and offered her mediation. But the Spanish government repelled with indignation this attempt of foreign powers to interfere in its affairs. The consequences were the recall of the foreign ambassadors by their respective courts, and the march of 100,000 French soldiers across the Bidassoa. The duke of Angouléme, by whom this army was commanded, established a junta, consisting of Eguia, Calderon, and Erro, who formed a pro visional government, declaring the king the sole depositary of sovereign power, and that no change in the government should be recognised but such as the king should make of his own free choice. All the decrees of the Cortes were declared void ; in short, the object of French interference was simply to restore the reign of absolute power. Unfortunately the Cortes had no ally. The relations of Portugal to Great Britain did not allow her to conclude a defensive treaty with Spain. Britain remained neutral ; but the exportation of arms and ammunition to Spain was allowed, and, in parliament, Canning called the attempt of the French unjust, and wished the arms of the Cortes success; an expression of sympathy which led the Spaniards for a time to hope that Britain would take a part in the war. Ferdinand, for greater safety, had removed to Seville, and on the 23d of April 1823 he formally declared war against France ; but he in vain called on the nation to support the consti tution. The great mass of the people were completely under the influence of the most bigoted priesthood in the world, who of course were absolutists, and hailed the arrival of the French ; the adherents of the constitution were confined to the educated class, the army, and the in habitants of cities. The Spanish army might be equal in strength to that of the French, but a considerable part of it was disposed in garrisons and fortresses, scattered over a large surface of country. The military operations of the</p><p>French, during their advance upon Madrid, were the siege and capture of several strong towns, and a few partial engagements, in one of which, at least, that of Logroño, they were defeated. The southern provinces, where the absolutists had always a preponderancy, were occupied by the invaders with hardly any resistance ; but in Lower Cata lonia, where Mina commanded, they were kept in check for a considerable time. The main body of the French army under Angouléme hastened to the capital, which was occupied on the 24th of May. One of the first steps taken was to appoint a regency, which put every thing on the same footing as before March 7, 1820. But the regency had no pecuniary resources, and no power, if they had the will, to prevent the furious ebullitions of party hatred. The Cortes had in vain tried to excite a general guerilla war ; it was but too plain that the mass of the people, at once miserably ignorant and furiously bigoted, without any just notions of what rational liberty was, or in what the new constitution consisted, were content to sur render themselves entirely to the guidance of the priest hood, and consequently everywhere opposed the constitutionalists. Their hatred was still further increased by the seizure of all the property of persons of the opposite party, by a large forced loan, and by the coining of the superfluous church plate, to which measures the want of money compelled the Cortes to have recourse. The war had now spread from the south to the north over the whole breadth of the land, and was actively prosecuted in Andalusia and Estremadura. An attempt at mediation on the part of the English ambassador, Sir W. A’Court, failed ; and the king having refused to go to Cadiz, the Cortes, acting on that part of the constitution which provides for the moral incapacity of the sovereign, appointed a regency with royal powers. We cannot regard this proceeding in any other light than as a gross indignity offered to the king, and most impolitic at the time. However, Ferdinand accompanied the Cortes to Cadiz, and the regency ceased to exist. On the other hand, the members of the Cortes who had declared the king morally incapable, were denounced as traitors by the regency of Madrid, which now became recognised by foreign powers, Austria, Prussia, and France, as the only legitimate government of Spain.</p><p>Meanwhile the war was briskly carried on, but nothing would induce the people to join the constitutionalists, who accordingly were gradually driven from stronghold to strong hold, although in some places they made a gallant resist ance. Defection among the officers of the army materially contributed to the downfall of their cause. Morillo and Sarsfield were among the deserters. The regency of Madrid conducted themselves in a cruel and outrageous manner towards the friends of the constitution, notwithstanding the strenuous efforts of the French generalissimo to restrain their fury. The duke of Angouléme took possession of the city of Cadiz on the 4th October 1823. Previously to this, the Cortes had reinvested Ferdinand with absolute power, and requested him to remove to the French headquarters where he was received with becoming pomp. The first measure of the king was to declare all the acts of the constitutional government from March 7, 1820, to October 1, 1823, null and void, on the ground that during that period he was acting under compulsion. The war terminated in November ; and on the 22d of that month the duke of Angouléme took his leave of the army of the Pyrenees. Among the crowds of fugitives were Mina and the count of Abisbal ; and among the victims capitally punished was Riego, who suffered at Mad rid on the 6th of November.</p><p>The party which now succeeded to power, although weak from want of means, was powerful enough to exercise a persecuting and vindictive policy towards the former partisans of the constitution.
