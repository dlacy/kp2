<p><span class="font1">-and female cells. What is known about them tends to prove their structural similarity rather than their difference. But&nbsp;it is possible that their difference may be chemical, and so&nbsp;not to be detected by the microscope.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The normal </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sexual act</span><span class="font1"> has been described as consisting in the fusion, first, of two cells, then of their nuclei, and finally,&nbsp;often after a long interval, of their chromosomes and of their&nbsp;chromomeres in meiosis. What causes determined these&nbsp;fusions is a question that is only partly answered. It is known&nbsp;in certain cases </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> ferns and mosses) that the male cell is&nbsp;attracted to the female by chemical substances secreted for&nbsp;the purpose by the female organ; that it is a case of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Chemio-laxis.</span><span class="font1"> Probably this is more common than experiment has&nbsp;yet shown it to be. It is quite conceivable that the consequent&nbsp;cell-fusion, as also the subsequent fusions of nuclei and of&nbsp;•chromosomes, are likewise cases of chemiotaxis, depending&nbsp;upon chemical differences between the fusing structures.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sexual process can only take place between cells which .are related to each other in a certain degree (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Hybridism);&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">that is, it depends upon </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">sexual affinity.</span><span class="font1"> It is the general&nbsp;rule that it takes place between cells derived from different&nbsp;individuals of the same species; that is, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cross-fertilization</span><span class="font1"> is&nbsp;the rule. This is necessarily the case when the male and female&nbsp;organs are developed upon different individuals, when the&nbsp;plant is said to be </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dioecious.</span><span class="font1"> When both kinds of organs are&nbsp;developed upon the same individual </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(monoecious),</span><span class="font1"> self-fertilization may and often does occur; but it is commonly hindered&nbsp;by various special arrangements, of which </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dichogamy</span><span class="font1"> is the&nbsp;most common; that is, that the male and female organs are&nbsp;not mature at the same time. But though these arrangements&nbsp;favour cross-fertilization, they do not absolutely prevent self-fertilization. In some cases, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cleistogamic</span><span class="font1"> flowers, for instance,&nbsp;self-fertilization alone is possible (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Angiosperms).</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;general conclusion is that though cross-fertilization is the more&nbsp;advantageous form of sexual reproduction, still self-fertilization&nbsp;is more advantageous to the species than no fertilization at all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In considering this subject, it must be borne in mind that the terms used have different meanings when applied to certain&nbsp;heterosporous plants from thosc which they convey when&nbsp;applied to isosporus plants. In the latter cases their meaning&nbsp;is direct and simple: in the former it Isindirectandsomewhat&nbsp;complicated. In heterosporous plants generally the actual&nbsp;sexual organs are never borne upon the same individual, there&nbsp;is always necessarily a male and a female gametophyte; so&nbsp;that, strictly speaking, self-fertilization is impossible. But in&nbsp;the Phanerogams, where there is a process preliminary to fertilization, that of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pollination,</span><span class="font1"> which is unknown in other plants,&nbsp;the terms and the conceptions expressed by them are applied,&nbsp;not to the real sexual organs, but to the spores. Thus a dioecious Phanerogam is one in which the microspores are developed&nbsp;by one individual, the megaspores by another; and again,&nbsp;self-fertilization is said to occur when the microspores (pollen)&nbsp;fall upon thé stigma of the same flower (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Angiosperms);&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">but this is really only </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">self-pollination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To return to the sexual process itself. Whatever its nature, two sets of results follow upon the sexual act—(i) a zygote&nbsp;is formed, which is capable of developing into a new organism,&nbsp;from two cells, neither of which could so develop; (2) the&nbsp;hereditary sporophytic characters of the two parents are possessed by the organism so developed. These two results will&nbsp;now be considered in some detail.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(1) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Relation between the Sexual Act and Reproductive Capacity.—</span><span class="font1">In the early days of the discovery of the sexual process,&nbsp;it was thought that the capacity for development imparted to&nbsp;the female cell was to be attributed to the doubling of its nuclear&nbsp;substance by the fusion with the male cell. Reproductive&nbsp;capacity does not, however, depend upon the bulk of the nuclear&nbsp;substance, for a spore, like an unfertilized female cell, contains&nbsp;but the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font1"> number of chromosomes, and yet it can give rise to a&nbsp;new organism. Again, it has been observed (Winkler) that a&nbsp;non-nucleated fragment of an oosphere of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Cystoseira</span><span class="font1"> (Fucaceae)&nbsp;can be “ fertilized ” by a Spermatozoid and will then grow and&nbsp;divide to form a small embryo, though it necessarily contains only&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">x</span><span class="font1"> number of chromosomes. From this it would appear that&nbsp;some stimulating influence had been exerted by the male cell,&nbsp;and it is probably in this direction that the desired explanation&nbsp;is to be sought. Some important confirmatory facts have been&nbsp;recorded with regard to certain animals (sea-urchins). It has&nbsp;been observed (Loeb) that treatment with magnesium chloride&nbsp;will cause the ova to grow and segment; and similar results have&nbsp;been obtained (Winkler) by treating the ova with a watery&nbsp;extract of the male cells. Hence it may be inferred that the male&nbsp;cell carries with it, either in its cytoplasm (kinoplasm), or in&nbsp;its nucleus, extractable substances, perhaps of the nature of&nbsp;enzymes, that stimulate the female cell to growth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It may be mentioned that the stimulating effect of fertilization is not necessarily confined to the female cell; very frequently&nbsp;adjacent tissues are stimulated to growth and structural change.&nbsp;In a Phanerogam, for instance, the whole ovule grows and&nbsp;develops into the seed: the development of endosperm in the&nbsp;embryo-sac is initiated by another nuclear fusion, taking place&nbsp;between the second male nucleus and the endosperm-nucleus:&nbsp;the ovary, too, grows to form the fruit, which may be dry and hard&nbsp;or more or less succulent: the stimulating effect may extend to&nbsp;other parts of the flower; to the perianth, as in the mulberry;&nbsp;to the receptacle, as in the strawberry and the apple: or even&nbsp;beyond the flower to the axis of the inflorescence, as in the fig and&nbsp;the pine-apple. Analogous developments in other groups are&nbsp;the calyptra of the Bryophyta, the cystocarps of the Red Algae,&nbsp;the ascocarps of the Ascomycetes, the aecidia of the Uredineae,&nbsp;&amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Relation of the Sexual Act to Heredity.</span><span class="font1">—Theproductof the sexual act is essentially a diploid cell, the zygote, which&nbsp;actually is or gives rise to a sporophyte. The sexual heredity&nbsp;of plants consequently presents the peculiar feature that the&nbsp;organism resulting from the sexual act is quite unlike its immediate parents, which are both gametophytes. But it is clear&nbsp;that the sporophytic characters must have persisted, though in&nbsp;a latent condition, through the gametophyte, to manifest themselves in the organism developed from the zygote.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The real question at issue is as to the exact means by which these characters are transmitted and combined in the sexual act.&nbsp;There is a considerable amount of evidence that the hereditary&nbsp;characters are associated with the chromomeres, and that it is&nbsp;rather their linin-constituent than their chromatin which is&nbsp;functional (Strasburgcr): that they constitute, in fact, the&nbsp;material basis of heredity. From this point of view it is&nbsp;probable that the last phase of the sexual act, the fusion of the&nbsp;chromomeres in meiosis, represents the combination of the two&nbsp;sets of parental characters. What exactly happens in the&nbsp;pseudo-chromosome stage is not known; at any rate this stage&nbsp;offers an opportunity for a complete redistribution of the&nbsp;substance of the chromomeres—in other words, of the parental&nbsp;pangens. It is a striking fact that, in the subsequent nuclear&nbsp;division, the distribution of the chromosomes derived from the&nbsp;male and female parents (when they can be distinguished) seems&nbsp;to be a matter of indifference: they are not equally distributed&nbsp;to the two daughter-nuclei. The explanation would appear&nbsp;to be this, that they are not any longer male and female as they&nbsp;were before meiotic fusion; and that it is because they now&nbsp;contain both male and female nuclear substance that their equal&nbsp;distribution to the daughter-nuclei is unimportant.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The nature of this redistribution of the substance of the chromomeres is still under discussion. Some regard it as&nbsp;essentially a chemical process, resulting in the formation of new&nbsp;compounds: others consider it to be rather a physical process,&nbsp;a new material system being formed in the rearrangement of the&nbsp;pangens; here it must be left for the present.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The various ways in which the parental characters manifest themselves in the progeny are fully dealt with in the articles&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Heredity, Hybridism, Mendelism.</span><span class="font1"> It will suffice to say that&nbsp;the progeny, though maintaining generally the characters of the&nbsp;species, do not necessarily exactly resemble either of the parents,&nbsp;nor do they necessarily present exactly intermediate characters:</span></p>
