<p><span class="font0">manded loudly the regimental </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">accounts. They ſeized </span><span class="font0">at the fame time the military cheſt, and ſent a deputa-tion to ſtate their caſe at Paris to the national aſſembly.&nbsp;But the officers were before-hand, and prepoffeſſed the&nbsp;miniſter of war againſt them ; upon whoſe repreſentation a decree was paſſed, authoriſing the commander in&nbsp;chief of the province, M. Bouille, to reduce the inſurgents by force. This was no ſooner known, than the&nbsp;national guard of Nancy affembled, and ſent </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">deputation to give a fair ſtatement of facts. But Bouille,&nbsp;without waiting the refult of an explanation, haſtened&nbsp;to Nancy at. the head of all the troops he could ſudden-</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Iv </span><span class="font0">collect ; and having fallen upon the regiments of&nbsp;Chateauvieux and Meſtre de Camp, after putting an&nbsp;immenſe multitude to the ſword, he took 4.00 priſoners.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The King’s regiment was prevented from acting againſt Bouille by thc intrepidity of a young officer of&nbsp;tlie name </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Deſſt/es,</span><span class="font0"> who, however, died of the wounds&nbsp;w hich he received on the occaſion. Tile news of theſe&nbsp;events filled Paris with indignation. The aſſembly afterwards reverſcd its own decrees againſt thc inſnrgents&nbsp;at Nancy. Public honours were decreed to the memory of Deffillcs ; but Bouille could not be puniſhed,&nbsp;becauſe he had only acted in obedience to authority.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">M. Neckar’s popularity had been gradually declining, as he was unwilling to go all the lengths that the ruling party wiſhed. He gave in his reſignation on&nbsp;the 4th of September, and ſpeedily thereafter left the&nbsp;kingdom. He was regretted by no party. He was&nbsp;regarded, on the one ſide, as having conducted the kingdom to its ruin, by the conceffions which he originally&nbsp;adviſed the king to make in favour of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tiers etat ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">while he was deſpiſed by the oppoſite party as a lukewarm politician, of narrow views, and a feeble mind.&nbsp;He departed, however, with thé unblemiſhed reputation of ſtrict integrity. M. Neckar does not ſeem to&nbsp;have penetrated deeply into the characters of men, or&nbsp;to have had any conception of the effects of that terrible and reſtleſs energy which is called forth in a nation which attempts to make important changes in its ancient manners and government. Having no conception of the important era which was about to open&nbsp;upon that country of which he was the miniſter, lie&nbsp;was ſar from being qualified to direct or controul it&nbsp;amidſt the convulſions which it was deſtined to encounter. Unable to brook thc loſs of his popularity,&nbsp;he peeviſhly retired to Swiſſerland, where he publiſhed&nbsp;a work, which ſhows to the conviction of every unprejudiced reader the integrity of the French king, and&nbsp;the wicked projects of the leading democrates, whom&nbsp;he himſelf had armed with power.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The remaining part of tin’s year was occupied in attempts to introduce ſome degree of ſubordination into the navy of France, which had been much diſorganized,&nbsp;and in farther regulating the affairs of the clergy. It&nbsp;was now declared, that ſuch clergymen as ſhould not&nbsp;take the foliowing oath, which had been preſcribed&nbsp;ſome months before, ſhsuld be conſidered as ejected&nbsp;from their benefices : &quot; To watch carefully over the&nbsp;faithful in the pariſh or dioceſe which was entruſted to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Iſis </span><span class="font0">care ; to be faithſul to the nation, the law, and the&nbsp;king ; and to maintain to the utmoſt of his power the&nbsp;new conſtitution of France, and particularly the decrees&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">relative to </span><span class="font0">thc civil </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">conſtitution oſ the clergy.” This&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">decree rendered the ſituation of conſcientious </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">men etu&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">tremely perplexing ; eſpecialIy as the pope teſtiſied in&nbsp;marked terms his diſapprobation of the oath. The&nbsp;people were reduced to the dilemma of dhooſing be-tween their new political and their old religious preju-dſces, and the reſult was extremely unfavourable to the&nbsp;intereſt of religion.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The aſſembly commenced the new year with a decree, announcing the termination of its ſeſſion, which was to&nbsp;take place as foon as it ſhould have finiſhed the diſcuf·&nbsp;lion of a liſt of conſtitutioual articles. In the mean&nbsp;time, on the ſide of Germany, Spain, Italy, and Savoy,&nbsp;hoſtile appearances began to be exhibited, and bodies&nbsp;of troops advanced around the French frontier. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Emperor Leopold was, however, too cautious to announce his intentions ; and the King foon communica-ted a letter from him, containing proteſtations of amicable diſpoſitions, but addin&lt;r, that &quot; the innovations&nbsp;occaſioned by the decrees of the 4th of Auguſt ought&nbsp;to bc done away.” The King treated this merely a»&nbsp;an official meaſure on the part of the Emperor, that he&nbsp;might not appear to renounce the claims of certain German princes connected with Lorraine and Alſace. But&nbsp;the aſſembly expreſſed ſome alarm, and voted an augmentation of the national force. About this period.&nbsp;ſeveral new efforts were made by the diſaffected clergy&nbsp;in various parts of the kingdom to excite diſturbances,&nbsp;which it is unneceſſary to mention in detail. On the 20th&nbsp;of February the public attention was rouſed by a circumſtance that in any other ſtate of affairs would have&nbsp;been accounted unimportant. The King announced to&nbsp;the aſſembly, that his aunts, the daughters of Louis </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">XV.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">had that morning left Paris ; but as hc did not appre-hend that the exiſting laws laid them under any reſtraint in this reſpect, he had not oppoſed their departure. Aſter ſome debate,, the aſſembly agreed that the&nbsp;King had judged well ; and theſc princeſſes were left to&nbsp;purſue their journey to Rome, which they reached after ſome delays occaſioned by the jealouſy of certain&nbsp;municipalities through which they paſſed. Thus the-kingdom was gradually deſerted by every branch of the&nbsp;royal family, excepting the King and his eldeſt brother&nbsp;Monſieur. ſ he aſſembly, however, continued its Ia-bours with conſiderable quietneſa. In the end' of the&nbsp;month of March died the celebrated M. de Mirabeau,&nbsp;at the age of 42 years; a man whoſe integrity has for&nbsp;many good reaſons been much ſuſpected, but whoſe political addreſs- and intrepidity, and whoſe ſplendid powers of eloquence, have been ſeldom equalled. He re-ceived from his countrymen at his death marks of re-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ſpect unparalleled in modern hiſtory. During his ſhort illneſs, his door was bcſieged by anxious citizens. A-mourning of eight days was dccreed by the aſſembIy,&nbsp;and alſo a grand proceffion, which, was attendcd by all&nbsp;the public functionaries. He was the firſt who&quot;was·&nbsp;interred in the new magnificent Pantheon, conſecrated&nbsp;to the reception of the remains of illuſtrious men. But&nbsp;his aſhes were afterwards removed, in conſequence of&nbsp;very clear proofs that he had not been incorruptible by&nbsp;money.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the whole of thisſpring, much fear was en-tertained that ſome attempts at a counter revolution were about to be made. The emigrant army aſſembled&nbsp;on the borders of Alſace was reviewed by the prince of&nbsp;Condé. Their uniform was· black, faced with yellow,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
