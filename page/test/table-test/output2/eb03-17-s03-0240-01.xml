the act of converting a regular perſon, place, or benefice, into a ſecular one. Almoſt all the cathedral churches were anciently regular, that is, the canons were to be religious; but they have been ſince ſecularized. For the ſecularization of a regular church, there is required the authority of the pope, that of the prince, the biſhop of the place, the patron, and even the confient of the pople. Religious that want to be releaſed from their vow, obtain briefs of ſecularization from the pope.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
