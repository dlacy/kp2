<p><span class="font2">contemplated seizing the throne of the Basileus and took up the cause of Michael VII., who had been deposed in 1078 and&nbsp;to whose son his daughter had been betrothed. He sailed&nbsp;with 16,000 men against the empire in AIay 1081, and by&nbsp;February 1082 had occupied Corfu and Durazzo, defeating the&nbsp;emperor Alexis before the latter (October 1081). He was, however, recalled to the aid of Gregory VII., besieged in San Angelo&nbsp;by Henry IV. (June 1083). AIarching north with 36,000 men&nbsp;he entered Rome and forced Henry to retire, but an émeute&nbsp;of the citizens led to a three days’ sack of the city (May 1084),&nbsp;after which Guiscard escorted the pope to Rome. His son&nbsp;Bohemund, for a time master of Thessaly, had now lost the&nbsp;Greek conquests. Robert, returning to restore them, occupied&nbsp;Corfu and Kephalonia, but died of fever in the latter on the&nbsp;15th of July 1085, in his 70th year. He was buried'in S. Trinità&nbsp;at Vcnosa. Guiscard was succeeded by Roger “ Borsa,” his&nbsp;son by Sikelgaita; Bohemund, his son by an earlier Norman&nbsp;wife Alberada, being set aside. At his death Robert was&nbsp;duke of Apulia and Calabria, prince of Salerno and suzerain&nbsp;of Sicily. His successes had been due not only to his great&nbsp;qualities but to the “ entente ” with the Papal See. He created&nbsp;and enforced a strong ducal power which, however, was met&nbsp;by many baronial revolts, one being in 1078, when he demanded&nbsp;from the Apulian vassals an “ aid ” on the betrothal of his&nbsp;daughter. In conquering such wide territories he had little&nbsp;time to organize them internally. In the history of the Norman&nbsp;kingdom of Italy Guiscard remains essentially the hero and&nbsp;founder, as his nephew Roger II. is the statesman and&nbsp;organizer.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">ROBERT OF AUXERRE </span><span class="font2">(c. 1156-1212), French chronicler, was an inmate of the monastery of St Marien at Auxerre. At&nbsp;the request of Milo de Trainel (1155-1202), abbot of this house,&nbsp;he wrote a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicon,</span><span class="font2"> or universal history, which covers the&nbsp;period between the creation of the world and 1211. For the&nbsp;years previous to ri8i this is merely a compilation from&nbsp;Prosper of Aquitaine, Sigebert of Gembloux and others, but&nbsp;it is an original authority for the period from 1181 to 1211.&nbsp;It is one of the most valuable sources for the history of France&nbsp;during the reign of Philip Augustus, and it also contains information about other European countries, the Crusades and&nbsp;affairs in the East. AIolinier, in fact, describes the author as&nbsp;one of the best historians of the middle ages. Robert was&nbsp;evidently a man of great diligence and of sound judgment.&nbsp;Two continuators took the work down to 1228 and it was&nbsp;extensively used by later chroniclers. The original manuscript is now at Auxerre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chronicon</span><span class="font2"> was first published by N.

<p><span class="font2">ROBERT OF COURTENAY (d. 1228), emperor of Romania, or Constantinople, was a younger son of the emperor Peter of&nbsp;Courtenay, and was descended from the French king, Louis VI.,&nbsp;while his mother Yolande was a sister of Baldwin and Henry&nbsp;of Flanders, the first and second emperors of Constantinople.&nbsp;When it became known in France that Peter of Courtenay was&nbsp;dead, his eldest son, Philip, marquess of Namur, renounced&nbsp;the succession to the Latin empire of Constantinople in favour&nbsp;of his brother Robert, who set out to take possession of his&nbsp;distracted inheritance, which was then ruled by Conon of&nbsp;Bethune as regent. Crowned emperor on the 25th of March&nbsp;1221, Robert, who was surrounded by enemies, appealed Ior&nbsp;help to the pope and to the king of France; but meanwhile his&nbsp;lands were falling into the hands of the Greeks. Some little&nbsp;aid was sent from western Europe, but soon Robert was&nbsp;compelled to make peace with his chief foe, John Ducas Vataces,&nbsp;emperor of Nicaea, who was confirmed in all his conquests.&nbsp;Robert promised to marry Eudoxia, daughter of the late&nbsp;emperor of Nicaea, Theodore Lascaris I., a lady to whom he&nbsp;had been betrothed on a former occasion; however, he soon&nbsp;repudiated this engagement, and married a French lady,&nbsp;already the fiancee of a Burgundian gentleman. Heading a&nbsp;conspiracy, the Burgundian drove Robert from Constantinople,&nbsp;and early in 1228 the emperor died in Achaia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROBERT OF GLOUCESTER, English chronicler, is known only through his connexion with the work which bears his&nbsp;name. This is a vernacular history of England, from the days&nbsp;of the legendary Brut to the year 1270, and is written in rhymed&nbsp;couplets. The lines arc of fourteen syllables, with a break ,&nbsp;after the eighth syllable. The author gives his name as Robert;&nbsp;the dialect which he uses, and his acquaintance with local&nbsp;traditions, justify the supposition that he was a monk of&nbsp;Gloucester. He describes, from his own recollections, the bad&nbsp;weather which prevailed in the neighbourhood of Evcsham&nbsp;on the day of the battle between the Alontfortians and Prince&nbsp;Edward (1265). He also alluded to the canonization of Louis IX.&nbsp;of France, which took place in 1297. HeprobablywTOtc about&nbsp;the year 1300. The earlier part of his chronicle (up to 1135)&nbsp;may be from another hand, since it occurs in some manuscripts&nbsp;in a shorter form, and with an exceedingly brief continuation by an anonymous versifier. There is no good reason&nbsp;for the theory that this part was translated from a French&nbsp;original; nor docs it contain any undoubted borrowings from&nbsp;French sources. The authorities employed for the earlier part&nbsp;were Geoffrey of Monmouth, Henry of Huntingdon, William of&nbsp;AIalmesbury, the English Chronicles, and some minor sources;&nbsp;Robert, in making his recension of it, also used the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Brut</span><span class="font2"> of&nbsp;Layamon. From 1135 to 1256 Robert is still a compiler,&nbsp;although references to oral tradition become more frequent as&nbsp;he approaches his own time. From 1256 to 1270 he has the&nbsp;value of a contemporary authority. But he is more important&nbsp;to the philologist than to the historian. His chronicle is one of&nbsp;the last works written in Old English.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Robert’s chronicle was first edited by T. Hearne (2 vols., Oxford, 1724); but this text is now superseded by that of W. Aldis Wright&nbsp;(2 vols., Rolls Series, 1887).

<p><span class="font2">ROBERT OF JUMIÉGES (d. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">c.</span><span class="font2"> 1070), archbishop of Canterbury, was a Norman who became prior of St Ouen at Rouen and then abbot of Jumieges. A close friend of the future king of&nbsp;England, Edward the Confessor, he crossed over to England with&nbsp;Edward in 1042, and in 1044 became bishop of London. In&nbsp;English history Robert appears as the most trusted and the most&nbsp;prominent of the king’s foreign friends, and as the leader of&nbsp;the party hostile to the influence of Earl Godwine. In 1051,&nbsp;although the chapter had already made an election, Edward&nbsp;appointed him archbishop of Canterbury. He seems to have&nbsp;been sent by the king on an errand to Duke William of Normandy, and on the return of Godwine from exile in 1052 he fled&nbsp;in great haste from England. He was outlawed and deposed,&nbsp;and he died at Jumiêges about 1070. The treatment of Robert&nbsp;by the English was put forward by Wilfiam the Conqueror as a&nbsp;pretext for invading England.</span></p>
