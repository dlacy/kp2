<p><span class="font0">1826, at Breselenz, near Dannenherg in Hanover. His father, Friedrich Bernhard Riemann, came from Mecklenburg, had&nbsp;served in the war of freedom, and had finally settled as pastor&nbsp;in Quickborn. Here with his five brothers and sisters Ricmann&nbsp;spent his boyhood and received, chiefly from his father, the&nbsp;elements of his education. He showed at an early age well-marked mathematical powers, and his progress was so rapid in&nbsp;arithmetic and geometry that he was soon beyond the guidance&nbsp;not only of his father but of schoolmaster Schulz, who assisted in&nbsp;the mathematical department of his training.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1840 he went to Hanover, where he attended the lyceum, and two years later he entered the Johanneum at Lüneburg.&nbsp;The director, Schmalfuss, encouraged him in his mathematical&nbsp;studies by lending him books (among them Leonhard Euler’s&nbsp;works and Adrien Marie Legendre’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Theory of Numbers),</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;Riemann read, mastered and returned within a few days. In&nbsp;1846 Riemann entered himself as a student of philology and&nbsp;theology in the university of Göttingen. This choice of a&nbsp;university career was dictated more by the natural desire of his&nbsp;father to see his son enter his own profession, and by the poverty&nbsp;of his family, than by his own preference. He attended lectures&nbsp;on the numerical solution of equations and on definite integrals&nbsp;by M. A. Stern, on terrestrial magnetism by Goldschmidt, and&nbsp;on the method of least squares by K. F. Gauss. It soon became&nbsp;evident that his mathematical studies, undertaken at first&nbsp;probably as a relaxation, were destined to be the chief business&nbsp;of his life. He proceeded in the beginning of 1847 to Berlin,&nbsp;attracted thither by that brilliant constellation of mathematical&nbsp;genius whose principal stars were P. G. L. Dirichlet, C. G. J.&nbsp;Jacobi, J. Steiner and F. G. M. Eisenstein. He appears to have&nbsp;attended Dirichlet’s lectures on theory of numbers, theory of&nbsp;definite integrals, and partial differential equations, and Jacobi’s&nbsp;on analytical mechanics and higher algebra. It was during this&nbsp;period that he first formed those ideas on the theory of functions&nbsp;of a complex variable which led to most of his great discoveries.&nbsp;One stirring social incident at least marked this part of his life,&nbsp;for, during the revolutionary insurrection in March 1848, the&nbsp;young mathematician, as a member of a company of student&nbsp;volunteers, kept guard in the royal palace from 9 o’clock on the&nbsp;morning of the 24th of March till 1 o’clock on the afternoon of&nbsp;the following day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1850 he returned to Göttingen and began to prepare his doctor’s dissertation, busying himself meanwhile with “ Naturphilosophie ” and experimental physics. This double cultivation of his scientific powers had the happiest effect on his&nbsp;subsequent work; for the greatest achievements of Riemann&nbsp;were effected by the application in pure mathematics generally&nbsp;of a method (theory of potential) which had up to this time&nbsp;been used solely in the solution of certain problems that arise&nbsp;in mathematical physics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In November 1851 he obtained his doctorate, the thesis being “ Grundlagen für eine allgemeine Theorie der Functionen einer&nbsp;veränderlichen complexen Grösse.” This memoir excited the&nbsp;admiration of Gauss, and at once marked its author’s rank&nbsp;as a mathematician. The fundamental method of research&nbsp;which Riemann employed has just been alluded to; the results&nbsp;will be best indicated in his own words:— </span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The methods in Usehithertofortreatingfunctionsofacomplex variable always started from an expression for the function as its&nbsp;definition, whereby its value was given for every value of the argument; by our investigation it has been shown that, in consequence&nbsp;of the general character of a function of a complex variable, in a&nbsp;definition of this sort one part of the determining conditions is a&nbsp;consequence of the rest, and the extent of the determining conditions&nbsp;has been reduced to what is necessary to effect the determination.&nbsp;This essentially simplifies the treatment of such functions. Hitherto,&nbsp;in order to prove the equality of two expressions for the same&nbsp;function, it was necessary to transform the one into the other,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> to show that both expressions agreed for every value of the&nbsp;variable; now it is sufficient to prove their agreement to a far less&nbsp;extent ” [merely in certain critical points and at certain boundaries].</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The time between his promotion to the doctorate and his habilitation as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Privatdozent</span><span class="font0"> was occupied by researches&nbsp;undertaken for his Habilitationsschrift, by “ Naturphilosophie,”&nbsp;and by experimental work. The subject he had chosen for his&nbsp;Habilitationsschrift was the “ Representation of a Function&nbsp;by Means of a Trigonometrical Series,” a subject which Dirichlet&nbsp;had made his own by a now well-known series of researches.&nbsp;It was fortunate, no doubt, for Riemann that he had the kind&nbsp;advice and encouragement of Dirichlet himself, who was then&nbsp;on a visit at Göttingen during the preparation of his essay;&nbsp;but the result was a memoir of such originality and refinement&nbsp;as showed that the pupil was fully the equal of the. master.&nbsp;Of the customary three themes which he suggested for his trial&nbsp;lecture, that “ On the Hypotheses which form the Foundation&nbsp;of Geometry” was chosen at the instance of Gauss, who was&nbsp;curious to hear what so young a man had to say on this difficult&nbsp;subject, on which he himself had in private speculated so profoundly (see </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Geometry, Non-Euclidian).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1855 Gauss died and was succeeded by Dirichlet, who along with others made an effort to obtain Riemann’s nomination as extraordinary professor. In this they were not successful; but a government stipend of 200 thalers was given him,&nbsp;and even this miserable pittance was of great importance, so&nbsp;straitened were his circumstances. But this small beginning&nbsp;of good fortune was embittered by the deaths of his father and&nbsp;his eldest sister, and by the breaking up of the home at Quick-born. Meantime he was lecturing and writing the great memoir&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(BorchardFs Journal,</span><span class="font0"> vol. Iiv., 1857) in which he applied the&nbsp;theory developed in his doctor’s dissertation to the Abelian&nbsp;functions. It is amusing to find him speaking jubilantly of&nbsp;the unexpectedly large audience of eight which assembled to&nbsp;hear his first lecture (in 1854) on partial differential equations&nbsp;and their application to physical problems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Riemann’s health had never been strong. Even in his boyhood he had shown symptoms of consumption, the disease&nbsp;that was working such havoc in his family; and now under&nbsp;the strain of work he broke down altogether, and had to retire&nbsp;to the Harz with his friends Ritter and R. Dedekind, where he&nbsp;gave himself up to excursions and “ Naturphilosophie.” After&nbsp;his return to Gottingen (November 1857) he was made extraordinary professor, and his salary raised to 300 thalers. As&nbsp;usual with him, misfortune followed close behind; for he lost&nbsp;in quick succession his brother Wilhelm and another sister.&nbsp;In 1859 he lost his friend Dirichlet; but his reputation was&nbsp;now so well established that he was at once appointed to&nbsp;succeed him. Well-merited honours began to reach him; and&nbsp;in i860 he visited Paris, and met with a warm reception there.&nbsp;He married Elise Koch in June 1862, but the following month&nbsp;he had an attack of pleurisy which proved the beginning of a&nbsp;long illness that ended only with his death. His physician&nbsp;recommended a sojourn in Italy, for the benefit of his health,&nbsp;and Weher and Sartorius von Waltershausen obtained from&nbsp;the government leave of absence and means to defray the cost&nbsp;of the journey. At first it seemed that he would recover;&nbsp;but on his return in June 1863 he caught cold on the Splügen&nbsp;Pass, and in August of the same year had to go back to Italy.&nbsp;In November 1865 he returned again to Göttingen, but, although&nbsp;he was able to live through the winter, and even to work a few&nbsp;hours every day, it became clear to his friends, and clearest of&nbsp;all to himself, that he was dying. In order to husband his few&nbsp;remaining days he resolved in June 1866 to return once more&nbsp;to Italy. Thither he journeyed through the confusion of the&nbsp;first days of the Austro-Prussian War, and settled in a villa&nbsp;at Selasca near Intra on Lago Maggiore. Here his strength&nbsp;rapidly ebbed away, but his mental faculties remained brilliant&nbsp;to the last. On the 19th of July 1866 he was working at his&nbsp;last unfinished investigation on the mechanism of the ear.&nbsp;The day following he died. Few as were the years of work&nbsp;allotted to him, and few as are the printed pages covered by&nbsp;the record of his researches, his name is, and will remain, a&nbsp;household word among mathematicians. Most of his memoirs&nbsp;are masterpieces—full of original methods, profound ideas&nbsp;and far-reaching imagination.</span></p>
