<p><span class="font0">RUBY (Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rubeus,</span><span class="font0"> red), the most valued of all gem-stones, a red transparent variety of corundum, or crystallized alumina.&nbsp;It is sometimes termed “oriental ruby” to distinguish it from&nbsp;the spinel ruby, which is a stone of inferior hardness, density&nbsp;and value (see Spinel). When the word ruby is used without&nbsp;any qualifying prefix, it is always the true or so-called oriental&nbsp;stone that is meant in modern nomenclature. Ancient writers,&nbsp;relying chiefly on colour, classed together under a common&nbsp;name several brilliant red stones, such as the ruby, spinel and&nbsp;garnet: thus the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">avOpal;</span><span class="font0"> of Theophrastus and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Carbunadus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of Pliny were names which seem to have been applied to several&nbsp;distinct minerals. Although the word ruby is used in the&nbsp;English translation of the Old Testament it is improbable that&nbsp;the true ruby was known to the ancient Hebrews.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ruby crystallizes in the hexagonal system (see Corundum). The crystals have no true cleavage, but tend to break along certain gliding planes. The colour of ruby varies&nbsp;from deep cochineal to pale rose-red, in some cases with a&nbsp;tinge of purple, the most valued tint being that called by&nbsp;experts pigeon’s-blood colour. On exposure to a high temperature, the ruby becomes green, but regains its original&nbsp;colour on cooling. The red. colour of ruby may be due to&nbsp;chromium. When a ruby of the most esteemed tint is examined with the dichroscope, one image is generally seen to be&nbsp;carmine and the other aurora-red, the red colour inclining to&nbsp;orange. This test serves to distinguish the true ruby from&nbsp;spinel and from garnet, since these minerals, being .cubic, are&nbsp;not dichroic. Another means of distinction is afforded by the&nbsp;specific gravity of ruby (about 4), which is higher than that&nbsp;of spinel and garnet, whilst the superior hardness of the ruby&nbsp;(about 9) furnishes yet another test. The high refractivity&nbsp;of ruby is also characteristic, the mean ordinary index being&nbsp;1-77 and the extraordinary 1-76. When cut and polished the&nbsp;ruby is therefore a brilliant stone, but having weak dispersive&nbsp;power it lacks fire. Subjected to radiant discharge in a Crookes&nbsp;tube, the ruby, like other forms of corundum, phosphoresces&nbsp;with a vivid red glow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The oriental ruby is a mineral of very limited distribution. Its most famous localities are in Upper Burma, but until the&nbsp;British annexation of the country in 1886 the mines were so&nbsp;jealously guarded that little was known as to the conditions&nbsp;under which the mineral occurred. Soon after the annexation,&nbsp;the ruby districts were officially visited, and reported on, by&nbsp;Mr C. Barrington Brown, and specimens from the mines were&nbsp;exhaustively studied by Professor J. W. Judd. The principal&nbsp;district is situated in the neighbourhood of Mogok, 90 m.&nbsp;N.N.E. of Mandalay. The ruby occurs in bands of a crystalline&nbsp;limestone, associated with granitic and gneissose rocks, some&nbsp;of which are highly basic; and it is from the anorthite, or&nbsp;lime-felspar, and the associated minerals in the pyroxene-gneisses, that the corundum, spinel and calcite, may, according&nbsp;to Judd, have been derived. Probably the felspar is first&nbsp;altered to scapolite, and this on decomposition would yield&nbsp;calcium carbonate and hydrous aluminium silicates, from&nbsp;which the anhydrous alumina might ultimately be separated.&nbsp;The limestone contains (in addition to the ruby) spinel, garnet,&nbsp;graphite, wollastonite, scapolite, felspar, mica, pyrrhotite&nbsp;and other minerals. The ruby, like other kinds of corundum, suffers alteration under certain conditions, and passes&nbsp;by hydration into gibbsite and diaspore, which by further&nbsp;alteration and union with silica, &amp;c., may yield margarite,&nbsp;vermiculite, chlorite and other hydrous silicates.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Burmese rubies are not generally worked in the limestone matrix, ¿but are mostly found loose in detrital matter, which is clayey and sandy in character and yellowish-brown&nbsp;in colour, and is known locally as “ byon.” Some of the&nbsp;deposits occur in limestone caverns, where they may, like&nbsp;cave-earth, represent the insoluble residue of the limestone.&nbsp;Workings in the cave-deposits are called “ loodwins” (crooked&nbsp;mines). In the alluvium of the valleys, the ruby-pits are known&nbsp;as “ twinlones ” (round pits), whilst workings in the ruby-earth on the hillsides are termed “ hmyaudwins ” (water&nbsp;mines). The byon contains, with the ruby, other coloured&nbsp;corundums and spinels. Burmese rubies are found also in&nbsp;crystalline limestone in the hills near Sagyin, about 20 m. N.&nbsp;of Mandalay, and it is of mineralogical interest to note that&nbsp;the limestone here contains chondrodite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubies are found in Siam, at several localities in the provinces of Chantabun and Krat; and Professor H. Louis has described their occurrence at Moung Klung in this region. The&nbsp;rubies are found with sapphires and spinels, in gravels, resting&nbsp;in some cases on basic igneous rocks. The Siam rubies are&nbsp;generally of dark colour, often inclining to a deep reddish&nbsp;brown. Rubies occur, with sapphires and other minerals, in&nbsp;the gem-gravels of Ceylon, but are not usually of such good&nbsp;colour as the Burmese stones. A cloudy variety, which, when&nbsp;cut with a convex surface, exhibits a luminous star, is known&nbsp;as star-ruby (see Asterias). In peninsular India rubies are&nbsp;rarely found, though they have been reported from the corundum deposits of Madras and Mysore. The ruby is knowm,&nbsp;however, to occur in a micaceous limestone at Jagdalak, near&nbsp;Kabul in Afghanistan.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubies, generally of pale colour, are found with the sapphires of Montana, especially at Yogo Gulch near Utica. In the&nbsp;corundum deposits of N. Carolina ruby is occasionally met&nbsp;with, especially at Cowee Creek, Macon county, where it occurs in crystals of tabular, rhombohedral and prismatic habit.&nbsp;These crystals, sometimes of fine colour, are found in gravels&nbsp;resting on a soft rock called saprolite, which results from the&nbsp;weathering of certain basic igneous rocks; and it is notable&nbsp;that the ruby crystals are associated wdth the variety of garnet&nbsp;termed rhodolite, as described by Professor Judd and W. E.&nbsp;Hidden. Australia has occasionally yielded rubies, but mostly&nbsp;of small size and inferior quality. In New South Wales and in&nbsp;Victoria they have been found in drift gravels, and a magenta-coloured turbid variety from Victoria has been described under&nbsp;the name of barklyite.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubies have been produced artificially with much success. At one time it was the practice to fuse together small fragments&nbsp;of the natural stone; and gems cut from such material were&nbsp;known as reconstructed rubies. This process has given way&nbsp;to Professor A. Vemeuil’s method of forming artificial ruby from&nbsp;purified ammonia-alum with a certain proportion of chrome-alum. The finely powdered material is caused to fall periodically into an oxyhydrogen flame, the heat of which decomposes&nbsp;the alum, and the alumina thus set free forms liquid drops&nbsp;which collect and solidify as a pear-shaped mass. When of&nbsp;the characteristic pigeon’s-blood colour, the synthetical ruby&nbsp;contains about 2*5% of chromic oxide. The manufactured&nbsp;ruby possesses the physical characters of corundum, but may&nbsp;generally be distinguished by microscopic bubbles and striae.&nbsp;The manufacture is carried out commercially. (For other processes, see Gem, Artiticial.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It should be noted that several minerals known popularly as rubies have no relation to the true red corundum. Thus,&nbsp;“ Cape rubies ” from the South African diamond&quot; mines,&nbsp;“Australian rubies” from South Australia, and “Arizona&nbsp;rubies” are merely fine garnets; “Siberian ruby” is red&nbsp;tourmaline (see Rubellite), and “Balas ruby” is spinel&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font0"> Ruby silver is a name applied to light red silver ore,&nbsp;or proustite; ruby copper is merely cuprite, in brilliant crystals;&nbsp;and ruby-blende is a dear red variety of zinc sulphide.</span></p>
