<p><span class="font1">RENAUD DE MONTAUBAN (Rinaldo di Montalbano), one of the most famous figures of French and Italian romance. His&nbsp;story was attached to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">geste</span><span class="font1"> of Doon of Mayence by the 13th-century </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trouvère</span><span class="font1"> who wrote the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chanson de geste</span><span class="font1"> of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Renaus de&nbsp;Montauban<sub>i</sub></span><span class="font1">  better known perhaps as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Les quatre fils Aymon.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">The four sons of Aymon give their name to inns and streets in&nbsp;nearly every town of France, and the numerous prose versions&nbsp;show what a hold the story gained on the popular imagination.&nbsp;Renaud’s sword Floberge, and his horse Bayard passed with&nbsp;him into popular legend. The poem of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Renaus de Montauban&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">opens with the story of the dissensions between Charlemagne&nbsp;and the sons of Doon of Mayence, Beuves d’Aigremont, Doon&nbsp;de Nanteuil and Aymon de Dordone. The rebellious vassals&nbsp;are defeated by the imperial army near Troyes, and, peace&nbsp;established, Aymon rises in favour at court, and supports the&nbsp;emperor, even in his persecution of his four sons, Renaud,&nbsp;Alard, Guichard and Richard. A second feud arises from a&nbsp;quarrel between Renaud and Bertolai, Charlemagne’s nephew,&nbsp;over a game of chess, in the course of which Renaud kills Ber-tolai with the chess-board. The hero then mounts his steed&nbsp;Bayard, and escapes with his brothers to the Ardennes, where&nbsp;they build the castle of Montessor overlooking the Meuse. At&nbsp;Château Renaud, near Sédan, there existed in the 18th century&nbsp;a ruined castle with a tower called the “ tour Maugis ” and the&nbsp;reputed stable of Bayard. The outlaws are eventually persuaded&nbsp;to seek their fortune outside Charlemagne’s kingdom, and cross&nbsp;the Loire to take service with King Yon of Gascony against&nbsp;the Saracens, accompanied by their cousin, the enchanter Maugis.&nbsp;Yon, however, is compelled by Charlemagne to withdraw his&nbsp;protection, and the castle of Montauban, which the brothers&nbsp;have built on the Dordogne, is besieged by the emperor. They&nbsp;next seek refuge beyond the Rhine, and sustain a third siege&nbsp;at Trémoigne (Dortmund), after which the emperor is persuaded by the barons to make peace. Bayard is abandoned&nbsp;to Charlemagne, and thrown into the Meuse, only to rise again.&nbsp;He still gallops over the hills of the Ardennes on St John’s&nbsp;Eve. Renaud, who throughout the story is a type of the&nbsp;Christian and chivalric virtues, makes a pilgrimage to the Holy&nbsp;Land and is invested with some of the exploits of Godfrey de&nbsp;Bouillon. On his return he gives himself up to religion, working&nbsp;as a mason on the church of St Peter at Cologne, where he&nbsp;receives martyrdom at the hands of his jealous fellow-labourers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The story is closely connected with the legend of Girard -de Roussillon. The </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">chanson de geste</span><span class="font1"> of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Renaus de Montauban&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">falls into sections which had probably been originally the&nbsp;subject of separate recitals. These may have arisen at different&nbsp;-dates, and were not necessarily told in the first instance of&nbsp;the same person, the account of Renaud on the crusade being&nbsp;obviously a late interpolation. The outlaw life of the brothers&nbsp;in the Ardenncs bears the marks of trustworthy popular tradition,&nbsp;and it was even at one time suggested that the Gascon and&nbsp;Rhenish episodes were reduplications of the story of Montessor.&nbsp;The connexion of the four brothers with'Montessor, Dortmund,&nbsp;Mayence and Cologne, and the abundant local tradition,&nbsp;mark the heroes as originating from the region between the&nbsp;Rhine and the Meuse. Nevertheless, their adventures in&nbsp;Gascony are corroborated by historical evidence, and this&nbsp;section of the poem is the oldest. The enemy of Renaud was&nbsp;Charles Martel, not Charlemagne; Yon was Odo of Gascony,&nbsp;known indifferently as duke, prince, or king; the victory over&nbsp;the Saracens at Toulouse, in which the brothers are alleged&nbsp;to have taken part, was won by him in 721, and in .719 he&nbsp;sheltered refugees from the dominions of Charles Aiartel, Chil-peric II., king of Neustria, and his mayor of the palace, Ragin-fred, whom he was compelled to abandon. In a local chronicle&nbsp;of Cologne it is stated that Saint Reinoldus died in 697, and in&nbsp;the Latin rhythmical </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Vita</span><span class="font1"> his martyrdom is said to have taken&nbsp;place under Bishop Agilolf (d. 717). Thus the romance was&nbsp;evidently composite before it took its place in the Carolingian&nbsp;cycle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Iu Italy Renaud had his greatest vogue. His connexion with the treacherous family of Mayence was thrust into the background, and many episodes were added, as well as the personage&nbsp;of the hero’s sister, Bradamante. Rinaldo di Montalbano had&nbsp;been the subject of many ItaHan poems before </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Il Rinaldo</span><span class="font1"> of&nbsp;Tasso.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RENAUDOT, EÜSÈBE (1646-1720), French theologian and Orientalist, was born in Paris in 1646, and educated for the&nbsp;church. Notwithstanding his taste for theology and his title&nbsp;of abbé, much of his life was spent at the French court, where&nbsp;he attracted the notice of Colbert and was often employed in&nbsp;confidential affairs. The unusual learning in Eastern tongues&nbsp;which he acquired in his youth and maintained amid the distractions of court life did not bear fruit till he was sixty-two.&nbsp;His best-known books are </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">HistoriaPatriarcharum Alexandrinorum&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(Paris, 1713) and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Liturgiarum Orientalium collectio</span><span class="font1"> (2 vols.,&nbsp;1715-16). The latter was designed to supply proofs of the&nbsp;“ perpetuity of the faith ” of the church on the subject of the&nbsp;sacraments, the topic on which most of his theological writings&nbsp;turned, and which was then, in consequence of the controversies&nbsp;attaching to Arnauld’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Perpétuité de la foi,</span><span class="font1"> a burning one between&nbsp;French Catholics and Protestants. Renaudot was not a fair&nbsp;controversialist, but hjs learning and industry are unquestionable. He died ift 1720.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RENAUDOT, THÉOPHRASTE (1586-1653), French physician and philanthropist, was bom at Loudun (Vienna), and&nbsp;studied surgery in Paris. He was only nineteen when he&nbsp;received, by favour apparently, the degree of doctor at Montpellier. After some time spent in travel he began to practise&nbsp;in his native town.
