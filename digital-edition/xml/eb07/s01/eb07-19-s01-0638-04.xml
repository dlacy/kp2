among the Jews, called also <hi rend="italic">Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> or Holy of Holies, was the holiest and most retired part of the temple of Jerusalem, in which the ark of the covenant was preserved, and into which none but the high priest was allowed to enter, and that only once a year, to intercede for the people.</p><p>Some distinguish the sanctuary from the <hi rend="italic">Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> and maintain that the whole temple was called the sanctuary.</p><p>To try and examine any thing by the weight of the sanctuary, is to examine it by a just and equal scale ; because among the Jews it was the custom of the priests to keep stone weights, to serve as standards for regulating all weights by, though these were not at all different from the royal or profane weights.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sanctuary,</hi> in the Roman Catholic church, is also used for that part of the church in which the altar is placed, being encompassed with a rail or balustrade.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sanctuary,</hi> according to our ancient customs, is the same with asylum.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
