is a word, of which though generally underſtood, it is not eaſy to give a proper definition. An excellent moral writer has defined it to be “ an obligation to labour for the benefit of the maſter, without the contract or consent of the servant.” But may not he be properly called a ſlave who has given up his freedom to diſcharge a debt which he could not otherwiſe pay, or who has thrown it away at a game of hazard ? In many nations, debts have been legally diſcharged in this manner; and in ſome ſavage tribes, ſuch is the universal ardour for gaming, that it is no uncommon thing for a man, after having lost at play all his other property, to flake, on a ſingle throw oſ dice, himſelf, his wife, and his children<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(a)</hi> Aleam (quod mirere) ſobrii inter ſeria exercent, tanta lucrandi perdendive temeritate, ut cum omnia defecerunt, extremo ac novissimo jactu de libertate et corpore contendant.

See <hi rend="smallcaps">Philology,</hi> n⁰ 220.</p><p>As nothing can be more evident than that all men have, by the law of nature, an equal right to life, liberty, and the produce of their own labour (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Right, n⁰</hi> 5.), it is not eaſy to conceive what can have firſt led one part of them to imagine that they had a right to enſlave another. Inequalities of rank are indeed inevitable in civil ſociety ; and from them reſults that ſervitude which is founded in contract, and is of temporary duration. (See <hi rend="smallcaps">Moral Philosophy,</hi> n⁰ 141.) He who has much property has many things to attend to, and muſt be diſpoſed to hire perſons to aſſiſt and ſerve him ; while thoſe who have little or no property muſt be equally willing to be hired for that purpoſe. And if the maſter be kind, and the servant faithful, they will both be happier in this connection than they could have been out of it. But from a ſtate of ſervitude, where the ſlave is at the abſolute diſpoſal of his maſter in all things, and may be transferred without his own conſent from one proprietor to another, like an ox or an aſs, happineſs muſt be for ever baniſhed. How then came a traffic ſo unnatural and unjuſt as that of ſlaves to be originally introduced into the world ?</p><p>The common anſwer to this queſtion is, that it took its riſe among lavages, who, in their frequent wars with each other, either maſſacred their captives in cold blood, or condemned them to perpetual ſlavery. In ſupport of this opinion we have heard it obſerved, that the Latin word <hi rend="italic">ſervus,</hi> which ſignifies not a <hi rend="italic">hired</hi> servant, but a <hi rend="italic">ſlave, is</hi> derived from servare <hi rend="italic">, "tο</hi> preſerve;” and that ſuch men were called s <hi rend="italic">ervi,</hi> becauſe they were captives, whoſe lives were preſerved on the condition of their becoming the property of the victor.</p><p>That ſlavery had its origin from war, we think extremely probable<note anchored="true" n="3" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(C) In the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Society,</hi> the reader will find another account of the origin of ſlavery, which we think likewiſe probable, though we have not transferred it to this place ; as it would, in our opinion, be wrong to give to one writer what we know to belong to another. It may be proper, however, to obſerve here, that between the two articles there is no contradiction, as barbarous wars were certainly <hi rend="italic">one</hi> ſource of ſlavery.</p></note> (C), nor are we inclined to controvert this etymology of the word <hi rend="italic">ſervus ;</hi> but the traffic in men prevailed almoſt univerſally long before the Latin<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0529.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0523"/>
language or Roman name was heard of ; and there is no good evidence that it began among ſavages. The word OF, in the Old Teſtament, which in our verſion is rendered s <hi rend="italic">ervant,</hi> ſignifies literally a sla <hi rend="italic">ve,</hi> either born in the family or bought with money, in contradiſtinction to שביד, which denotes a hired servant : and as Noah makes uſe of the word עבד in the curſe which he denounces upon Ham and Canaan immediately after the deluge, it would appear that ſlavery had its origin before that event. If ſo, there can be little doubt but that it began among thoſe violent perſons whom our tranſlators have called <hi rend="italic">giants</hi><note anchored="true" n="4" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Gen. vi. 4.</p></note> *, though the original word כפלים literally ſignifies <hi rend="italic">aſſaulters of others.</hi> Thoſe wretches ſeem firſt to have ſeized upon women, whom they forcibly compelled to miniſter to their pleaſures ; and from this kind of violence the progreſs was natural to that by which they enſlaved their weaker brethren among the men, obliging them to labour for their benefit, without allowing them fee or reward.</p><p>After the deluge the firſt dealer in ſlaves ſeems to have been Nimrod. “ He began,” we are told, “ to be a mighty one in the earth, and was a mighty hunter, before the Lord.” He could not, however, be the firſt hunter of wild beaſts ; for that ſpecies of hunting must have been practiſed from the beginning ; nor is it probable that his dexterity in the chase, which was then the univerſal employment, could have been ſo far ſuperior to that of all his contemporaries, as to entitle him to the appellation of the “ the mighty hunter before the Lord.” Hence most commentators have concluded, that he was a hunter of men ; an opinion which they think receives ſome countenance from the import of his name, the word <hi rend="italic">Nimrod</hi> ſignifying a rebel. Whatever be in this, there can belittle doubt but that he became a mighty one by violence ; for being the ſixth ſon of his father, and apparently much younger than the other five, it is not likely that his inheritance exceeded theirs either in extent or in population. He enlarged it, however, by conqueſt ; for it appears from Scripture, that he invaded the territories of Aſhur the ſon of Shem, who had ſettled in Shinar ; and obliging him to remove into Aſſyria, he ſeized upon Babylon, and made it the capital of the firſt kingdom in the world. As he had great projects in view, it ſeems to be in a high degree probable that he made bond- ſervants of the captives whom he took in his wars, and employed them in building or repairing the metropolis of his kingdom ; and hence we think is to be dated the origin of poſtdeluvian ſlavery.</p><p>That it began thus early can hardly be queſtioned ; for we know that it prevailed univerſally in the age of Abraham, who was born within ſeventy years after the death of Nimrod. That patriarch had three hundred and eighteen ſervants or ſlaves, born in his own houſe, and trained to arms, with whom he purified and conquered the four kings who had taken captive his brother’s ſon<note anchored="true" n="5" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Gen. xii. 16. xx. 14. xxiv. 35. xxvi. 13, 14. xxx. 43.</p></note> *. And it appears from the conversation</p><p>which took place between him and the king of Sodom after the battle, that both believed the conqueror had a right to conſider his priſoners as part of his ſpoil. “ Give me (ſays the king) the <hi rend="italic">ρersons,</hi> and take the <hi rend="italic">goods</hi> to thyſelf.” It is indeed evident from numberleſs paſſages of ſcripture, that the domeſtics whom our tranſlators call s <hi rend="italic">ervants</hi> were in thoſe days univerſally conſidered as the moſt valuable part of their maſter’s property, and claſſed with his flocks and herds. Thus when the ſacred hiſtorian deſcribes the wealth of Abraham, he ſays, that “ he had sheep and oxen, and he-aſſes, and men-ſervants, and maid-ſervants, and ſhe-aſſes, and camels.” And when Abimelech wiſhed to make ſome reparation to the patriarch for the unintended injury that he had done him, “ he took ſheep and oxen, and men-ſervants, and women-ſervants, and gave them unto Abraham, and reſtored to him Sarah his wife.” The riches and power of Iſaac and Jacob are eſtimated in the very ſame manner. Of the former it is ſaid, that “ the man waxed great, and went forward and grew, until he became very great : for he had poſſeſſion of flocks, and poſſeſſion of herds, and great ſtore of ſervants, וצבדה of ſlaves ; and the Philiſtines envied him.” The latter, we are told, “ increaſed exceedingly, and had much cattle, and maid-ſervants, and men-ſervants, and camels, and aſſes<note anchored="true" n="6" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Lev. xxv. 39, 40, 44, 46.</p></note> *.”</p><p>That the practice of buying and selling ſervants thus early begun among the patriarchs deſcended to their poſterity, is known to every attentive reader of the Bible. It was expreſsly authoriſed by the Jewiſh law, in which are many directions how ſuch ſervants were to be treated. They were to be bought only of the heathen ; for if an Israelite grew poor and fold himſelf either to diſcharge a debt, or to procure the means of ſubſiſtence, he was to be treated not as a ſlave צבד but as a hired servant and reſtored to freedom at the year of Jubilee. “ Both thy bond men and thy bondmaids (ſays Moſes) ſhall be of the heathen that are round about you : of them ſhall ye buy bond men and bond-maids. And ye ſhall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit them for a poſſeſſion ; they ſhall be your bond-men for ever<note anchored="true" n="7" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Lev. xxi. 16.</p></note> *.” Unlimited as the power thus given to the Hebrews over their bond-servants of heathen extraction appears to have been, they were ſtrictly prohibited from acquiring ſuch property by any other means than fair purchaſe : “ he that stea <hi rend="italic">leth</hi> a man and ſelleth him,” ſaid their great lawgiver, “ ſhall ſurely be put to death</p><p>Whilſt ſlavery, in a mild form, was permitted among the people of God, a much worſe kind of it prevailed among the heathen nations of antiquity. With other abominable cuſtoms, the traffic in men quickly ſpread from Chaldea into Egypt, Arabia, and over all the eaſt, and by degrees found its way into every known region under heaven<note anchored="true" n="8" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(d)</hi> If credit be due to a late account of China, the people of that vaſt empire have never made merchandiſe of men or women.

tent δ with taking a transient view of it among the Greeks and Romans, and a ſewother nations, in whoſe cuſtoms and manners our readers muſt be interested.</p><p>One can hardly read a book of the Iliad or Odyſſey, withoutperceiving that, in the age of Homer, all priſoners of war were liable to be treated as ſlaves, and compelled, without regard to their rank, ſex, or years, to labour for their maſters in offices of the vileſt drudgery. So univerſally was this cruel treatment of captives admitted to be the right of the victor, that the poet introduces Hector, in the very act of taking a tender and perhaps laſt farewell of his wife, when it was ſurely his buſineſs to afford her every conſolation in his power, telling her, as a thing of courſe which could not be concealed, that, on the conqueſt of Troy, ſhe would be compelled</p><p>To bear the victor’s hard commands, or bring</p><p>The weight of water from Hyperia’s ſpring<note anchored="true" n="9" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Justin. lib. iii. cp. 4.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(e).</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Pope.</hi></p><p>At that early period, the Phoenicians, and probably the Greeks themſelves, had ſuch an eſtabliſhed commerce in ſlaves, that, not ſatisfied with reducing to bondage their priſoners of war, they ſcrupled not to kidnap in cold blood perſons who had never kindled their reſentment, in order to ſupply their foreign markets. In the 14th book oſ the Odyſſey, Ulyſſes repreſents himſelf as having narrowly eſcaped a ſnare of this kind laid for him by a false Phoenician, who had doomed the hero to Libyan ſlavery : and as the whole narrative, in which this circumſtance is told, is an artful fiction, intended to have the appearance of truth to an Ithacan peaſant, the practice of kidnapping ſlaves could not then have appeared incredible to any inhabitant of that iſland.</p><p>Such were the manners oſ the Greeks in the heroic age ; nor were they much improved in this reſpect at periods of greater refinement. Philip of Macedon having conquered the Thebans, not only fold his captives, but even took money for permitting the dead to be buried<note anchored="true" n="10" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Justin et Arrian.</p></note> *; and Alexander, who had more generoſity than Philip, afterwards razed the city of Thebes, and fold the inhabitants, men, women, and children, for ſlaves<note anchored="false" n="11" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Beattie's Moral Science, vol. ii.</p></note> *. This cruel treatment of a brave people may indeed be ſuppoſed to have proceeded, in the firſt inſtance, from the avarice of the conqueror; and in the ſecond, from the momentary reſentment of a man who was ſavage and generous by turns, and who had no command of his paſſions. We ſhall not poſitively aſſign it to other cauſes ; but from the manner in which the Spartans behaved to their ſlaves, there is little reaſon to imagine that had they received from the Thebans the ſame provocation with Alexander, they would have treated their captives with greater lenity. “ At Sparta (ſays a humane and elegant writer<note anchored="true" n="12" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Kames' Sketches.</p></note>) ſlaves were treated with a degree oſ rigour that is hardly conceivable ; although to them, as their huſbandmen and artificers, their proud and idle maſters were indebted for all the neceſſaries of life. The Lacedemonian youth, trained up in the practice of deceiving and butchering thoſe poor men, were from time</p><p>to time let looſe upon them, in order to ſhow their proficiency in ſtratagem and maſſacre. And once, without any provocation, and merely for their own amuſement, we are told that they murdered three thouſand in one night, not only with the connivance of law, but by its avowed permiſſion. Such, in promoting the happineſs of one part of ſociety and the virtue of another, are the effects of ſlavery.”</p><p>It has been said, that in Athens and Rome ſlaves were better treated than in Sparta : but in the former city their treatment cannot have been good, nor their lives comfortable, where the Athenians reliſhed that tragedy of Euripides in which Hecuba, the wife of Priam, is introduced as lamenting that ſhe was chained like a dog at Agamemnon’s gate ! Of the eſtimation in which ſlaves were held in Rome, we may form a tolerable notion from the well known fact, that one of thoſe unhappy beings was often chained at the gate of a great man’s houſe, to give admittance to the gueſts invited to a feast<note anchored="true" n="13" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Cicero de Div. lib. cap. 26.</p></note> *. In the early periods of the commonwealth it was cuſtomary, in certain ſacred ſhews exhibited on solemn occasions, to drag through the circus a ſlave, who had been ſcourged to death holding in his hand a fork in the form of a gibbet<note anchored="true" n="14" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(e)</hi> In thoſe early times drawing water was the office of the meaneſt ſlaves. This appears from Joſhua’s curſe upon the Gibeonites who had deceived him.— " Now therefore ye are curſed, and there ſhall none of you be freed from being bond-men, and hewers of wood, and drawers of water, for the houſe of my God.” To this ſtate of bondage Homer makes Hector ſay, that Andromache would <hi rend="italic">necessarily</hi> be brought upon the deſtruction of Troy ; χραερ ζ΄ επιχεισετ΄αναγχη. Il. lib. vi.</p></note> *. But we need not multiply proofs of the cruelty of the Romans to their ſlaves. If the inhuman combats of the gladiators (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Gladiators)</hi> admit of any apology on account oſ the martial ſpirit with which they were thought to inſpire the ſpectators, the conduct of Vedius Pollio muſt have proceeded from the moſt wanton and brutal cruelty. This man, who flouriſhed not in the earlieſt periods of the republic, when the Romans were little better than a ſavage banditti, but in the poliſhed age of Auguſtus, frequently threw ſuch ſlaves as gave him the ſlighteſt offence into his fiſh-ponds to fatten his lampreys ; and yet he was ſuffered to die in peace ! The emperor, indeed, upon coming to the knowledge of his cruelty, ordered his lampreys to be destroyed, and his ponds to be filled up ; but we do not recollect that any other puniſhment was inflicted on the ſavage maſter. Till the reign of the ſame emperor the depoſitions of ſlaves were never admitted in the courts of judicature ; and then they were received only when perſons were accuſed of treasonable practices.</p><p>The origin of ſlavery in Rome was the ſame as in every other country. Priſoners of war were of courſe reduced to that ſtate, as if they had been criminals. The dictator Camillus, one of the moſt accompliſhed generals of the republic, sold his Hetruriah captives to pay the Roman ladies for the jewels which they had presented to Apollo. Fabius, whoſe cautious conduct ſaved his country when Hannibal was victorious in Italy, having ſubdued Tarentum, reduced 30,000 of the citizens to ſtavery, and fold them to the higheſt bidder. Coriolanus, when driven from Rome, and fighting for the Volſci, ſcrupled not to make ſlaves of his own countrymen ; and Julius Cæsar, among whoſe faults wanton<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0531.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0525"/>
cruelty has never been reckoned, ſold at one time fifty- three thouſand captives for ſlaves. Nor did the ſlaves in Rome conſiſt only of foreigners taken in war. By one of the laws of the twelve tables, creditors were empowered to seize their inſolvent debtors, and keep them in their houſes till, by their ſervices or labour, they had diſcharged the ſum they owed : and in the beginning of the commonwealth they were authoriſed to ſell ſuch debtors, and even to put them to death<note anchored="true" n="15" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* De Mor. Germ. 24. 25.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(f).</hi> The children of ſlaves were the property not of the commonwealth, or of their own parents, but of their maſters ; and thus was ſlavery perpetuated in the families of ſuch unhappy men as fell into that ſtate, whether through the chance of war or the cruelty of a sordid creditor<note anchored="true" n="16" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Wilkins' Collection of Laws from Ethelbert to Henry III.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(g).</hi> The conſequence was, that the number of ſlaves belonging to the rich Patricians was almoſt incredible. Caius Cæcilius Iſidorus, who died about ſeven years before the Chriſtian era, left to his heirs 4116 ſlaves ; and if any one of thoſe wretched creatures made an unſucceſsful attempt to regain his liberty, or was even ſuſpected of ſuch a deſign, he was marked on the forehead with a red hot iron<note anchored="true" n="17" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(f)</hi> After a certain number of citations, the law granted to the debtor thirty days of grace to raiſe the ſum for which he was accountable. The words of the law are : “ Æris confeſſi, rebuſque jure judicatis, triginti dies juſti ſunto. Poſt dein manum endojacito.—Vincito aut nervo, aut compedibus.” “ When the debt is confeſſed, and the trial paſſed, let there be thirty days of forbearance : afterwards lay hands on him ; bind him either with a cord or fetters.” After the thirty days were expired, if the debtor had not diſcharged the debt, he was led to the prætor, who delivered him over to the mercy of his creditors ; theſe bound him and kept him in chains for the space of ſixty days. Afterwards, for three market-days ſucceſſively, the debtor was brought to the tribunal of the prætor ; then a public crier proclaimed in the forum the debt for which the priſoner was detained. It often happened, that rich perſons redeemed the priſoner by paying his debts; but if nobody appeared in behalf of the debtor after the third market-day, the creditor had a right to inflict the puniſhments appointed by the law. “ Tertiis nundinis capite pœnas dato aut trans Tiberim peregre venumduito ;” that is, “ Let him on the third market-day be puniſhed with death, or ſold beyond the Tiber as a ſlave.” If there were ſeveral creditors, they were allowed, in conſequence of this ſevere law, to divide the body of the priſoner into ſeveral parts, and ſhare it among them in proportion to the ſum which they demanded.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">(h).</hi> In Sicily, during the moſt flouriſhing periods of the commonwealth, it ſeems to have been cuſtomary for maſters to mark their ſlaves in this manner ; at leaſt we know that ſuch was the practice of Damophilus, who, not ſatisfied with this ſecurity, ſhut up his ſlaves every night in cloſe priſons, and led them out like beaſts in the morning to their daily labour in the field. Hence aroſe the ſervile war in Sicily.</p><p>Though many laws were enacted by Auguſtus and other patriotic emperors to diminiſh the power of creditors over their inſolvent debtors ; though the influence of the mild ſpirit of Chriſtianity tended much to meliorate the condition of ſlaves, even under Pagan maſters; and though the emperor Adrian made it capital to kill</p><p>a ſlave without a just reaſon ; yet this infamous commerce prevailed univerſally in the empire for many ages after the converſion of Conſtantine to the religion of Chriſt. It was not indeed completely aboliſhed even in the reign of Juſtinian; and in many countries which had once been provinces of the empire it continued long after the empire itſelf had fallen to pieces.</p><p>It has already been obſerved, that among the ancient Germans it was not uncommon for an ardent gameſter to loſe his perſonal liberty by a throw of the dice. This was indeed a ſtrong proof of lavage manners ; but the general condition of ſlaves among thoſe ſavages ſeems to have been much better than among the poliſhed Greeks and Romans. In Germany the ſlaves were generally attached to the soil, and only employed in tending cattle, and carrying on the busineſs of agriculture ; for the menial offices of every great man’s houſe were performed by his wife and children. Such ſlaves were ſeldom beaten, or chained, or impriſoned. Sometimes indeed they were killed by their maſters in a fit of ſudden paſſion ; but none were conſidered as materials of commerce, except thoſe who had originally been freemen, and loſt their freedom by play. Theſe, indeed, the ſucceſsful gameſter was very ready to ſell, both becauſe he felt them an uſeleſs burden, and becauſe their preſence continually put him in mind of that ſtate to which a throw of the dice might one day reduce himſelf.</p><p>Such is the account which Tacitus gives<note anchored="true" n="18" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="smallcaps">(g)</hi> This is evident from the ſtory of Appius and Virginia.

This man being proſcribed, and a reward offered for his head by the triumvirs Octavianus, Antony, and Lepidus, concealed himſelf from the fury of the tyrants in the beſt way that he could. A ſlave whom he had marked with the hot iron having found out the place of his retreat, conducted him to a cave, and there ſupported him for ſome time with what he earned by his daily labour. At length a company of ſoldiers coming that way, and approaching the cave, the faithful ſlave, alarmed at the danger his maſter was in, followed them cloſe, and falling upon a poor peaſant, killed him in their preſence, and cut off his head, crying out, “ I am now revenged on my maſter for the marks with which he has branded me.” The ſoldiers, ſeeing the infamous marks on his forehead, and not doubting but he had killed Reſtio, ſnatched the head out of his hand, and returned with it in all haste to the triumvirs. They were no fooner gone, than the ſlave conveyed his maſter to the ſea-side, where they had the good luck to find one oſ Sextius Pompeius’s veſſels, which tranſported them ſafe into Sicily.</p></note> *, the purchaſe of a <hi rend="italic">man,</hi> a <hi rend="italic">horſe,</hi> or an <hi rend="italic">ox,</hi> without a voucher to warrant the ſale, was ſtrictly forbidden.

us that ſo late as the ninth or tenth century a man, when fairly purchaſed, was, in England, as much the property oſ the buyer as the horſe on which he rode, or the ox which dragged his plough. In the ſame country, now ſo nobly tenacious of freedom and the rights of man, a ſpecies of ſlavery ſimilar to that which prevailed among the ancient Germans ſubſiſted even to the end of the ſixteenth century. This appears from a commiſſion iſſued by Queen Elizabeth in 1574, for inquiring into the lands and goods of all her <hi rend="italic">bond-men</hi> and <hi rend="italic">bond-women</hi> in the counties of Cornwall, Devon, Somerſet,and Glouceſter, in order to compound with them for their manumiſſion, that they might enjoy their lands and goods as freemen<note anchored="true" n="20" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Kames's Sketches, book i. sketch 5.</p></note> *. In Scotland there certainly exiſted an order of ſlaves or bond-men, who tilled the ground, were attached to the soil, and with it were transferable from one proprietor to another, at a period <hi rend="italic">ſo</hi> late as the thirteenth century ; but when or how thoſe villains, as they were called, obtained their freedom, ſeems to be unknown to every lawyer and antiquary of the preſent day. Coalliers and ſalters were, in the ſame country, ſlaves till little more than 20 years ago, that they were manumitted by an act of the Britiſh legiſlature, and reſtored to the rights of freemen and citizens. Before that period the ſons of coalliers could follow no buſineſs but that of their fathers ; nor were they at liberty to ſeek employment in any other mines than thoſe to which they were attached by birth, without the conſent of the lord of the manor, who, if he had no uſe for their ſervices himſelf, transferred them by a written deed to ſome neighbouring proprietor.</p><p>That the ſavage nations of Africa were at any period of hiſtory exempted from this opprobrium of our nature which ſpread over all the reſt of the world, the enlightened reader will not ſuppoſe. It is indeed in that vaſt country that ſlavery has in every age appeared in its uglieſt form. We have already obſerved, that about the era of the Trojan war, a commerce in ſlaves was carried on between Phoenicia and Lybia : and the Carthaginians, who were a colony of Phoenicians, and revered the cuſtoms, manners, and religion of their parent ſtate, undoubtedly continued the Tyrian traffic in human fleſh with the interior tribes of Africa. Of this we might reſt aſſured, although we had no other evidence of the fact than what results from the practice of human ſacrifices ſo prevalent in the republic of Carthage. The genuine inſtincts of nature are often ſubdued by dire ſuperſtition, but they cannot be wholly eradicated ; and the rich Carthaginian, when a human victim was demanded from him to the gods, would be ready to ſupply the place of his own child by the ſon of a poor ſtranger, persidiouſly purchaſed at whatever price. That this was, indeed, a very common practice among them, we learn from the teſtimony of various hiſtorians<note anchored="true" n="21" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Polyb. Q. Curt. Diod. Sic. See also Ancient Universal History, vol. xv.</p></note> *, who aſſure us, that when Agathocles the tyrant of Syracuſe had overthrown their generals Hanno and Bomilcar, and threatened Carthage itſelf with a ſiege, the people attributed their misfortunes to the juſt anger of Saturn for having been worſhipped, for ſome years, by the ſacrifices of children meanly born and ſecretly <hi rend="italic">bought,</hi> inſtead of thoſe of noble extraction. Theſe ſubſtitutions of one offering for another were conſidered as a profane deviation from the religion of their fore- fathers ; and therefore to expiate the guilt of ſo horrid an impiety, a ſacriſice of two hundred children of the</p><p>firſt rank was on that occaſion made to the bloody god. As the Carthaginians were a commercial people, we cannot ſuppoſe that they purchaſed ſlaves only for ſacrifices. They undoubtedly condemned many of their priſoners of war to the ſtate of ſervitude, and either sold them to foreigners, or diſtributed them among their ſenators and the leaders of their armies. Hanno, who endeavoured to uſurp the ſupreme power in Carthage whilſt that republic was engaged in war with Timoleon in Sicily<note anchored="true" n="22" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Justin. lib. xxi. cap. 6. a Universal History.</p></note> *, armed twenty thouſand of his ſlaves in order to carry his nefarious purpoſe into execution ; and Hannibal, after his deciſive victory at Cannae, sold to the Greeks many of his priſoners whom the Roman ſenate refuſed to redeem<note anchored="true" n="23" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Tit. L. Appian Zonaras.</p></note> *. That illuſtrious commander was indeed more humane, as well as more politic, than the generality of his countrymen. Before his days it was cuſtomary with the Carthaginians either to maſſacre their captives in cold blood, that they might never again bear arms againſt them, or to offer them in ſacriſice as a grateful acknowledgment to the gods by whoſe aſſiſtance they believed that they were vanquiſhed ; but this was not always done even by their moſt ſuperſtitious or moſt unprincipled leaders. Among other rich ſpoils which Agathocles, after his victory already mentioned, found in the camp of Hanno and Bomilcar, were twenty thouſand pair of fetters and manacles, which thoſe generals had provided for ſuch of the Sicilian prisoners as they intended to preſerve alive and reduce to a ſtate of ſlavery.</p><p>With the ancient ſtate of the other African nations we are but very little acquainted. The Numidians, Mauritanians, Getulians, and Garamantes, are indeed mentioned by the Roman hiſtorians, who give us ample details of the battles which they fought in attempting to preſerve their national independence ; but we have no particular account of their different manners and cuſtoms in that age when Rome was diſputing with Carthage the sovereignty of the world. All the African ſtates of which we know any thing, were in alliance with one or other of thoſe rival republics; and as the people of thoſe ſtates appear, to have been leſs enlightened than either the Romans or the Carthaginians, we cannot ſuppoſe that they had purer morals, or a greater regard for the ſacred rights of man, than the powerful nations by whom they were either protected or oppreſſed. They would, indeed, inſenſibly adopt their cuſtoms ; and the ready market which Marius found for the prisoners taken in the town Capſa, although Salluſt acknowledges<note anchored="true" n="24" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Bell. J. cap. 91.</p></note> * that the ſale was contrary to the laws of war, ſhows that ſlavery was then no ſtrange thing to the Nunaidians. It ſeems indeed to have prevailed through all Africa from the very firſt peopling of that unexplored country ; and we doubt if in any age of the world the unhappy negro was abſolutely secure of his perſonal freedom, or even of not being sold to a foreign trader.</p><p>It is the common opinion that the practice of making ſlaves of the negroes is of a very modern date ; that it owes its origin to the incurſions of the Portuguese on the weitem coaſt oſ Africa ; and that but for the cunning or cruelty of Europeans, it would not now exiſt, and would never have exiſted. But all this is a complication of miſtakes. A learned writer has lately proved, with a force of evidence which admits of no reply<note anchored="true" n="25" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>Whitaker's Review of Gibbon's Roman History.</p></note> *, that from the Coaſt of Guinea a great trade in ſlaves<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0533.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0527"/>
was carried on by the Arabs ſome hundreds of years before the Portugueſe embarked in that traffic, or had even ſeen a woolly-headed negro. Even the wandering Arabs of the deſert, who never had any friendly correſpondence with the Christians of Europe, have from time immemorial been ſerved by negro ſlaves. “ The Arab muſt be poor indeed (says M. Saugnier) not to have at leaſt one negro ſlave. His ſole occupation is the care of the herd. They are never employed in war, but they have it in their power to many. Their wives, who are captive negreſſes, do all the domeſtic work, and are roughly treated by the Arabian women, and by the Arabs themſelves. Their children are ſlaves like them, and put to all kinds of drudgery.” Surely no man whoſe judgement is not completely warped by prejudice, will pretend that thoſe roving tribes of ſavages,ſo remarkable for their independent ſpirit and attachment to ancient cuſtoms, learned to enſlave the negroes from the Europeans. In all probability they have, without interruption, continued the practice of ſlavery from the days of their great anceſtor Iſhmael ; and it ſeems evident, that <hi rend="italic">none of the European nations had ever ſeen a woolly-headed negro till the year</hi> 1100, when the cruſaders fell in with a ſmall party of them near the town of Hebron in Judea, and were so ſtruck with the novelty of their appearance, that the army burſt into a general fit of laughter. Long before the crusades, however, we know with certainty that the natives <hi rend="italic">of</hi> Guinea had been expoſed to ſale in foreign countries. In 651 the Mahometan Arabs of Egypt ſo haraſſed the king of Nubia or Ethiopia, who was a Chriſtian, that he agreed to ſend them annually, by way of tribute, a <hi rend="italic">vast number of Nubian or Ethiopian slaves</hi> into Egypt. Such a tribute as this at that time, we are told, was more agreeable to the khalif than any other, as the Arabs then made <hi rend="italic">no ſmall account oſ thoſe slaves</hi>.</p><p>The very propoſal of ſuch a tribute, and the eſtimation in which black ſlaves were held in Egypt, ſhows that a commerce in bond-ſervants could not then be a new branch of trade either to the Arabs or the Ethiopians ; but the vaſt number which the Ethiopian monarch was now compelled to furniſh every year, induced him to feed this great drain upon his ſubjects from the natives of the neighbouring countries. “ He ranged accordingly into all that vaſt <hi rend="italic">blank of geography</hi> upon the map of the world, the ſpreading boſom of the African continent ; and even puſhed through it to its fartheſt extremities in the west. He thus brought the blacks oſ Guinea, for the firſt time, into the ſervice and families of the eaſt ; and the ſlaves which he paid in tribute to the Arabs, whether derived from the nearer neighbourhood of Ethiopia, fetched from the mediterranean regions of Africa, or brought from the dictant ſhores of the Atlantic, were all denominated <hi rend="italic">Ethiopians,</hi> from the country by which they were conveyed into Egypt. “ At this time, therefore, according to Mr Whitaker, began that kind of traffic in human fleſh</p><p>“ Which ſpoils unhappy Guinea of its ſons.”</p><p>There are not many authors from whom, in questions of antiquity, we differ with greater heſitation ; but, as we meet with a female Ethiopian ſlave in the Eunuch of Terence, we cannot help ſuſpecting that Guinea was occaſionally " ſpoiled of its ſons” at a much earlier period. At any rate, from the obſervations made by the European</p><p>travellers who firſt penetrated into that continent, it appears undeniable that ſlavery muſt have prevailed from time immemorial among ſuch of the tribes as had never carried on any commerce with foreign nations. When Battel firſt viſited the Giagas<note anchored="true" n="26" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Modern Universal History, vol. xiii. chap. 47. sect 2.</p></note> *, thoſe people had never before ſeen a white man ; yet they welcomed him and the Engliſh, with whom he had come, to their country, invited them, to bring their goods on ſhore, and without heſitation loaded the ſhip with ſlaves. The Giagas were indeed waging war with the kingdom oſ Benguela; and being cannibals, who prefer human fleſh to all others, the ſlaves whom they had sold to the Engliſh were probably priſoners whom they would have killed and eaten if they had not found an opportunity of otherwiſe diſpoſing of them to greater advantage. But as they had not been incited by the Europeans to eat their priſoners, there can be no reaſon to ſuppoſe that by the Europeans they had been firſt induced to ſell them: for we have ſeen that this kind of commerce prevailed in Africa among people much more poliſhed than the Giagas ſo early as in the reign of Jugurtha.</p><p>That it was not introduced among the negroes either by the Arabs or by the Portugueſe, appears ſtill more evident from the behaviour of the Dahomans at the conqueſt of Whidah, and from the manner in which the people of Angola at the earlieſt ſtage of their foreign trade procured a ſupply of ſlaves for the Portugueſe market. The greater part of the ſlaves whom the Angolans exported from St Paulo de Loanda were brought from interior countries, ſome hundreds of leagues ditant, where they could not have been regularly purchaſed had that commerce been till then unknown in thoſe countries. The Dahomans, in the beginning of the year 1727, had never ſeen a white man : and when their victorious prince and his army, in their rout through Whidah, firſt met with ſome Europeans in the town of Sabi, they were ſo ſhocked at their complexion and their dreſs, that they were afraid to approach them, and could not be perſuaded that they were men till they heard them ſpeak, and were assured by the Wlridaneſe that theſe were the merchants who purchaſed all the ſlaves that were sold in Guinea<note anchored="true" n="27" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Modern Universal History, vol. xiii. p. 340, &amp; c.</p></note> *. Slavery, therefore, if it prevailed among the Dahomans before that period, could not have been introduced among them by European or Arabian intrigues: but we are assured by Snelgrave, who was then in the army, that thoſe people treated their captives with ſuch horrid cruelty as was shocking to the natives of the ſea-coaſt, and leaves no room for doubt but that ſlavery had been practiſed among them from the earlieſt ages. A great part of their priſoners were ſacriſiced to their gods or eaten by the loldiers ; and when our author expreſſed to a colonel of the guard ſome surpriſe that a prince ſo enlightened as the ſovereign of Dahomy ſhould ſacrifice ſo many men whom he might have sold to great advantage, he was gravely told, that it had been the cuſtom of their nation, from time immemorial, to offer, after victory, a certain number of priſoners to the gods; and that they ſelected the old men for victims, becauſe they were of leſs value at market, and more dangerous from their experience and cunning, than the young men. To thoſe perlons who fancy that the wars between the African princes are carried on for the ſole purpose of ſupplying the European ſhips with ſlaves, it may be proper to remark, that one of the kings of Dahomy ſlaughtered at once not only all the captives ta-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0534.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0528"/>

Theſe two nations may indeed have been the firſt who dragged the unhappy negro from his native continent, and made his ſlavery doubly ſevere, by compelling him to labour, without his own conſent, for masters whom he hardly conſidered as human beings.</p><p>On the beginning of this commerce, or the dreadful cruelty with which it has been carried on to the preſent day, it is impoſſible to reflect without horror : but there is ſome conſolation, however ſmall, in knowing that its original authors were not Europeans. The purchaſe of Guinea blacks for ſlaves by foreign nations commenced ages before the Portugueſe had laid that country open to the intercourſe of Europe. Even after they had made many incurſions into it, the inhabitants were as regularly purchaſed for ſlaves by ſome of the adjoining ſtates as they are now by the maritime Europeans.</p><p>“ The Arabs of Egypt having reduced all the north of Africa, and carrying with them their love of black ſervants, would be ſure to open a ready communication for themſelves to their country. They certainly had one ſo early as 1512, and before the Europeans had any for that purpoſe<note anchored="true" n="30" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(I) The ſame thing appears from the voyages of M. Saugnier, who had an opportunity of converſing with many tribes of negroes, and who always ſpeaks of ſlavery as an eſtabliſhed practice among them ; adding, that ſuch as are ſold for crimes are put to death by their own countrymen if they fly from their maſter. It appears likewiſe in a ſtill more ſtriking light from Dalzel’s Hiſtory of Dahomy, where we are told that all the Dahomans, from the loweſt to the higheſt, acknowledge the right of the ſovereign to diſpoſe of their perſons and properties at pleaſure ; and where we learn, that the ſovereign himſelf aſſured Mr Abſon the Engliſh governor at Whidah, that all his anceſtors had from time immemorial put to death every priſoner of war whom they could not sell as a ſlave.</p></note> (K).<note anchored="true" n="31" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>(K) In the year 1442, Anthony Gonſalez, a Portugueſe adventurer, reſtored to their native country ſome Mooriſh priſoners whom he had two years before forcibly carried off from the coaſt of Africa. He landed them at <hi rend="italic">Rio del-Oro,</hi> and received from the Moors in exchange ten blacks and a quantity of gold duſt. This transaction proves, that a commerce in black ſervants was then regularly carried on by the Moors and not by the Portugueſe. So early as the year 1502, the Spaniards began to employ a few negroes in the mines of Hiſpaniola ; but in the year following, Ovando, the governor of that iſland, forbade the further importation of them, alleging that they taught the Indians all manner of wickedneſs, and rendered them leſs tractable than formerly : and it was not till the year 1517 that the ſupply of negroes to the Spaniſh American plantations became an eſtabliſhed and regular branch of commerce. <hi rend="italic">Edward's History of the Weft Indies,</hi> Book IV.

From Hoden they turned to the left, and puſhed directly into the interior of the continent, to reach Tegazza, the <hi rend="italic">Tagazel</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Tagaza</hi> of our maps, and lying nearly eaſt of Hoden. Here affuredly they did, as the caravan does certainly at this day ; and added to the other wares upon their camels a quantity of ſalt from thoſe mines of rock-ſalt, which are extraordinary enough to be noticed as rocks in our maps. This they carried, as they ſtill carry it, toTanbut, the <hi rend="italic">Tombut</hi> or the maps, and a town in the heart of the African continent. And from this town they turned on the right for the ſea-coaſt again, and reached it in the great kingdom of Mele, the <hi rend="italic">Melli</hi> of our maps, to the ſouth of the Gambia, and just at the ſpringing as it were of that grand arch of ſea which curves ſo deeply into the body of the land, and conſtitutes the extenſive gulph of Guinea. At Melli and at Tombut they received a meaſure of gold for a meaſure of ſalt. The caravan collects gold at Tombut to the preſent time ; but at Melli they purchaſed gold, and alſo ſilver, in pieces as large as pebbles. And at Hoden they had <hi rend="italic">a great mart for βαves ;</hi> the blacks being brought thither from the countries adjoining, and bartered away to the traders. Such was the Slave Coaſt and the Gold Coaſt of former days. The ſtaple commodity of Hoden is only transferred now to Whidah ; and diverted from the Arabs of Barbary to the Chriſtians of Europe,” by whom the negroes are carried to the continent of America or to the Sugar Iſlands in the West Indies.

In ſome caſes good ſenſe, a regard for their reputation, and a well-informed conviction of their intereſt, induce men to treat their ſlaves with diſcretion and humanity. The ſlaves of many a planter posseſs advantages beyond what the labourer even of Britain enjoys<note anchored="true" n="36" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Ramsay's Essay, p. 66. and 91.</p></note> *;” yet theſe advantages all depend upon the good will of his maſter ; and in no part of the Britiſh colonies are the ſlaves attached to the ſoil. This ſingle circumſtance, together with the total neglect of their moral and religious culture, makes their ſituation much leſs eligible than was that of the French ſlaves under the old government ; and affords a ſtriking proof of what the humane author whom we have just quoted well obſerves, that “ thoſe men and nations whom liberty hath exalted, and who therefore ought to regard it tenderly in others, are conſtantly for reſtrain- ing its bleſſings within their own little circle, and delight more in augmenting the train of their dependants than in adding to the rank of fellow-citizens, or in diffuſing the benefits of freedom among their neighbours.”</p><p>Having given this ample detail of the rise and progreſs of ſlavery in the world, and ſhown that it has prevailed in every age, and under all religions, we ſhall now proceed to enquire whether a practice ſo general be in any inſtance lawful ; and if it be, how it muſt be modified, in order to be rendered consiſtent with the rights of man and the immutable laws of virtue.</p><p>That in a ſtate of nature one man has a right to ſeize upon another, and to compel him by force to labour for his ſubſiſtence, is a position which we believe has never been ſeriouſly maintained. But independent communities ſtand to each other in the very ſame relation that individuals do in a ſtate of nature ; and therefore if in ſuch a ſtate the man of greater bodily ſtrength or mental ſagacity would have no right to convert his weaker neighbour into personal property, neither can<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0536.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0530"/>
the more powerful and enlightened nation have a right to carry off by force, or entice by fraud, the subjects oſ a weaker and more barbarous community for the purpoſe of reducing them to a ſtate of ſervitude. This is a truth ſo obvious as to admit neither of proof nor of denial.</p><p>In thus ſtating the caſe between two independent nations, we have in our eye that traffic in ſlaves which is carried on between the civilized Europeans and the barbarous Africans: and the utmoſt length which we think an apologiſt for that trade can go is to contend, that we may lawfully purchaſe ſlaves in thoſe countries where from time immemorial they have been a common branch of commerce. But the European right to purchaſe cannot be better than the African right to ſell ; and we have never yet been informed what gives one African a right to sell another. Such a right cannot be natural, for the reaſon which we have elſewhere aſſigned (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Right)</hi>: neither can it be adventitious ; for adventitious rights are immediately derived from the municipal law, which is the public will of the ſtate. But the ſtate has no authority to deprive an innocent man of his perſonal freedom, or of the produce, of his own labour ; for it is only to ſecure theſe, by protecting the weak from the violence of the ſtrong, that ſtates are formed, and individuals united under civil government.</p><p>It may perhaps be ſaid, that by patiently ſuhmitting to governments which authoriſe the traffic in human fleſh, men virtually give up their perſonal liberty, and veſt their governors with a right to ſell them as ſlaves : but no man can veſt another with a right which he poſſeſſes not himſelf ; and we ſhall not heſitate to affirm, that in a ſtate of nature, where all have equal rights, no individual can ſubmit himſelf to the abſolute diſpoſal of another without being guilty of the greateſt crime. The reaſon is obvious. From the relation in which men ſtand to one another as fellow-creatures, and to God as their common Creator, there are duties incumbent upon each peculiar to himſelf; in the performance of which he can be guided only by his own reaſon, which was given him for that very purpoſe. But he who renounces his perſonal freedom, and ſubmits unconditionally to the caprice of a maſter, impiouſly attempts to ſet himſelf free from the obligation of that law which is interwoven with his very being, and chooſes a director of his conduct different from that which God has aſſigned him. A man therefore cannot put himſelf in a ſtate of unconditional ſervitude ; and what he cannot do for himſelf, he ſurely cannot authorize others to do for him either by a tacit or by an open conſent.</p><p>Theſe conſiderations have often made us regret that writers, for whoſe talents and integrity we have the higheſt reſpect, ſhould, without accurately defining what they mean by flavery, have peremptorily affirmed, that, conſiſtently with the law of nature men may be reduced to that ſtate as a puniſhment for crimes, or to diſcharge debts which they cannot otherwiſe pay. That a criminal, who has forfeited his life to the laws of his country, may have his puniſhment commuted for hard labour, till death in the courſe of nature shall put a period to his terreſtrial exiſtence, is a truth which we apprehend cannot be controverted ; but to make ſuch a commutation of puniſhments conſiſtent with the laws of nature and of nature’s God, it appears to us that the</p><p>kind and degree of labour muſt be preciſely aſcertained, and the conduct of the criminal not left to the capricious direction of any individual.</p><p>Puniſhments can be juſtly inflicted only for one or other of two ends, or for both. They may be calculated either to reform the criminal or to be a warning to the innocent ; and thoſe which moſt effectually anſwer both theſe purpoſes are ſurely to be preferred to ſuch as anſwer but one of them. For this reason we conſider hard labour as a much fitter puniſhment for moſt crimes than death : but to intitle it to preference, the kind and degree of the labour muſt be aſcertained by the law ; for if theſe circumſtances be omitted, and the offender delivered over as a ſlave to the abſolute diſpoſal and caprice of a private maſter, the labour to which he is condemned, inſtead of operating to his reformation, may be converted into the means of tempting him to the commiſſion of new crimes. A young woman, in the ſtate of ſervitude, would hardly be able to maintain her virtue againſt the ſolicitations of a maſter who ſhould promiſe her liberty or a remiſſion of toil upon her yielding to his delires ; and the felon, who had long been accuſtomed to a life of vagrancy and idleneſs, would not ſtrenuouſly object to the perpetration of any wickedneſs to obtain his freedom, or even a diminution of his daily task. Indeed ſuch temptations might be thrown in his way, as human nature could not reſiſt but by means of much better principles than felons can be ſuppoſed to posseſs. He might be ſcourged into compliance ; or his labour might be ſo increaſed as to make him for a little respite eagerly embrace the moſt nefarious propoſal which his maſter could make : for being abſolute property, there is no earthly tribunal to which he could appeal for juſtice ; and felons do not commonly ſupport themſelves under trials by pious meditation on a future ſtate.</p><p>By reaſoning in this way, we are far from meaning to insinuate that ſlave-holders in general torture their ſlaves into the commiſſion of crimes God forbid ! Many of them we know to be religious, humane, and benevolent : but they are not infallible ; and ſome of them may be inſtigated, ſome of them undoubtedly have been inſtigated, by avarice and other worſe principles, to compel creatures, who are ſo abſolutely their dependents, to execute deeds of darkneſs too hazardous for themſelves. But the morality or immorality of any action, and the moral fitneſs of any ſtate, are to be judged of by their natural tendency, if the one were univerſally practiſed and the other univerſally prevalent (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Moral Philosophy,</hi> n⁰ 156.) : and as the natural tendency of abſolute domeſtic slavery among such creatures as men is to throw the moſt powerful temptations to vice in the way both of maſter and of ſlave, it muſt be in every inſtance, even when employed as a puniſhment, inconſiſtent with the fundamental principles of moral virtue.</p><p>Some writers indeed have maintained, and the civil law ſeems to ſuppoſe, that children are the property of their parents, and may by them be ſold as ſlaves in caſes of urgent neceſſity : but if we duly conſider how property is acquired (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Property),</hi> and attend to the natural conſequences of slavery, we ſhall ſoon be convinced that this opinion is very ill founded. The rights of parents reſult ſrom their duties ; and it is certainly the duty of that man who has been the inſtrument of bringing into the world an intellectual and moral being.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0537.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0531"/>
to do everything in his power to render the exiſtence of that being happy both in the preſent life and in that which is to come. If this duty be conſcientiouſly diſcharged, the parent has a manifeſt right to the gratitude, love, and reaſonable obedience, of his child ; but he cannot, in consequence of any duty performed, claim a right to transfer that child as property to the uncontrolled diſpoſal of any private master ; for this plain reaſon, that the man who is conſidered as the private property of another, cannot reaſonably be ſuppoſed to enjoy happineſs in this world, and is under many temptations to do what muſt neceſſarily render him miſerable in the next. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Moral Philosophy,</hi> n⁰ 138.</p><p>If criminals cannot be lawfully reduced to a ſtate of abſolute private slavery, much leſs ſurely can it be lawful to reducc insolvent debtors and priſoners of war co that ſtate. Many a virtuous man, who has contracted debts with the fairest proſpcct of paying them, has been ſuddenly rendered inſolvent by fire, by ſhipwreck, or by the bankruptcy of others with whom he was neceſſarily engaged in the courſe of his trade. Such a man can be conſidered in no reſpect as criminal. He has been indeed unfortunate ; but it would be grossly unjuſt, as well as ſhockingly cruel, to add to his misfortune by reducing him to a ſtate to which we have juſt ſeen that the vileſt felon cannot be reduced without a violation of the laws of morality. Fraudulent bankrupts indeed, of whom we daily ſee many, might with great propriety and the ſtricteſt justice be compelled to extenuate their debts by labouring for the benefit of thoſe whom they have injured ; and criminals of other deſcriptions might be made to work for the benefit of the public : but in both cafes the taste to be performed ſhould be aſcertained by the law, and the perſons of the labourers be protected by the ſtate. lf ſuch can be called slaves, their slavery is undoubtedly confident with every principle of virtuc and religion ; for they ſuffer nothing but the due reward of their deeds. Priſoners of war, however, can upon no honeſt principle be reduced even to this ſtate of mitigated bondage ; tor they are ſo far from incurring guilt by fighting for their country, that even to their enemies their courage and conduct in ſuch a cauſe muſt appear worthy of reward. A victorious general has certainly a right to prevent the prhoners taken in battle from again drawing their ſwords against him during the continuance of the war ; but there are many ways by which this, may be done effectually without chaining the unfortunate captives to the oar, or selling them like cattle to private purchaſers, by whom they may be treated with capricious cruelty, and driven to the perpetration of the greateſt crimes.</p><p>To theſe concluſions, and the reaſoning on which they are built, we are aware it may be objected, that if private ſlavery were in every inſtance unlawful and in- conſistent with the fundamental principles of morality, it would not have prevailed among the ancient patriarchs, and far leſs have been authoriſed by the Jewiſh law.</p><p>In reply to this objection, it may be obſerved, that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, though excellent men, were not characters abſolutely perfect ; that as their practice does not authoriſe polygamy or inceſt among us, it will not authoriſe the reducing of our fellow-creatures to a ſtate of hopeleſs ſervitude; and that from the circumſtances of the age in which they lived, many things</p><p>were permitted to them, and were indeed harmleſs, which are forbidden to us, and would now be pernicious. The character oſ Abraham appears to have been much more perfect than that of his ſon or grandſon ; and was certainly equal, if not ſuperior, to that of any ether mere man of whom we read either in profane or even in ſacred hiſtory. We are to remember, however, that he was born amidſt idolaters, and was probably an idolater himſelf till enlightened by the inſpiration of Jehovah, and called from his kindred and from his father’s houſe. Before his converſion, he muſt have had much cattle and many ſlaves, which conſtituted the riches of that early period ; and his caſe would indeed have been peculiarly hard, had he been commanded to diveſt himſelf of his ſervants, and to depart into a ſtrange country very thinly inhabited, without people to protect his flocks and herds from beaſts of prey. Nor would his loſs have contributed in any degree to the benefit of his ſlaves, who, as the ranks of men were then adjuſted, could not long have preſerved their liberty. Had they not been forcibly reduced to their former ſtate by their idolatrous countrymen, which in all probability they would have been, they muſt have ſoon submitted to it, or periſhed by hunger. Let it be remembered, too, that the bond-ſervants of Abraham, though conſtituting the moſt valuable part of his property, were not conſidered as a ſpecies of inferior beings, but were treated rather as childeren than as ſlaves. This is evident from his ſpeaking of the ſteward of his houſe as his heir, when complaining to God of the want of ſeed. Indeed the manner in which this circumſtance is mentioned, ſhows that it was then the general practice to conſider domeſtic ſlaves as members of the family ; for the patriarch does not ſay, “ I will leave my ſubſtance to this Eliezer of Damaſcus;” but his words are, “ Behold to me thou haſt given no ſeed; and, lo! one born in my houſe is <hi rend="italic">my</hi> heir<note anchored="true" n="37" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Gen. xv. 3.</p></note> *. From this mode of expreſſion we are ſtrongly inclined to think that captives taken in war were in that age of ſimplicity incorporated into the family or tribe of the conqueror, as they are ſaid to be at preſent among the North American Indians, to ſupply the place of thoſe who had fallen in battle. If ſo, ſlavery was then a very mild thing, unattended with the evils which are now in its train, and muſt often have been highly beneficial to the captive.</p><p>The other part of the objection appears at firſt sight more formidable : but perhaps a little attention to the deſign of the Moſaic economy may enable us to remove it even more completely than this. We need not inform our theological readers, that one great purpoſe for which the poſterity of Abraham were ſeparated from the heathen nations around them, was to preſerve the knowledge of the true God in a world run headlong into idolatry. As idolatry appears to have had ſomething in its forms of worſhip extremely captivating to rude minds, and as the minds of the Iſraelites at the era of their departure from Egypt were exceedingly rude, every method was taken to keep their ſeparation from their idolatrous neighbours as complete as poſſible. With this view they were commanded to sacrifice the animals which their Egyptian maſters had worſhipped as gods, and were taught to conſider hogs and ſuch other creatures as the heathen offered in ſacrifice, when celebrating their myſtical and magic rites, as too unclean to be eaten or even to be touched.

ſtinction between clean and unclean beaſts, God himſelf aſſigns the reaſon : “ I am the Lord your God (ſays he), who have ſeparated you from other people ; ye ſhall therefore put difference between clean and unclean beaſts, and between unclean fowls and clean<note anchored="true" n="38" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Lev. xx. 24, 25, 26.</p></note> *.” For the ſame reaſon they were prohibited from intermarrying with the heathen, or having any tranſaction whatever with them as neighbours ; and the ſeven idolatrous nations of Canaan they were ſtrictly commanded to exterminate. “ When the Lord thy God (ſays Moſes) ſhall deliver them before thee, thou ſhalt finite them, and utterly deſtroy them : thou ſhalt make no covenant with them, nor ſhow mercy unto them : neither ſhalt thou make marriages with them: thy daughter thou ſhalt not give unto his ſon, nor his daughter ſhalt thou take to thy ſon ; for they will turn away thy ſon from following me, that they may ſerve other gods<note anchored="true" n="39" place="margin" type="authorial"><p>* Dout. vii. 2, 3, 4.</p></note> *.”</p><p>Under theſe laws, it is plain that no intercourſe whatever could have place between an Iſraelite and a man of any other nation, unleſs the latter was reduced to ſuch a ſtate as that he could neither tempt the former nor practiſe himſelf the rites of his idolatrous worſhip. But the Iſraelites were not ſeparated from the reſt oſ the world for their own ſakes only : They were intended to be the repoſitories of the lively oracles of God, and gradually to ſpread the light of divine truth thro’ other nations, till the fulneſs of time ſhould come, when in Chriſt all things were to be gathered together in one. To anſwer this end, it was necessary that there ſhould be ſome intercourſe between them and their Gentile neighbours ; but we have ſeen that ſuch an intercourſe could only be that which ſubſiſts between mailers and their ſlaves.</p><p>Should this apology for the ſlavery which was authoriſed by the Jewiſh law be deemed fanciful, we beg leave to ſubmit to the consideration of our readers the following account of that matter, to which the ſame objection will hardly be made. It was morally impoſſible that between nations differing ſo widely in religion, cuſtoms, and manners, as the Jews and Gentiles, peace ſhould for ever reign without interruption ; but when wars broke out, battles would be fought, and priſoners would be taken. How were theſe priſoners to be diſpoſed of ? Cartels for exchange were not then known : it was the duty of the Iſraelites to prevent their captives from taking up arms a ſecond time againſt them ; they could not eſtabliſh them among themſelves either as artificers or as huſhandmen ; for their law enjoined them to have no communication with the heathen. There was therefore no other alternative but either to massacre them in cold blood, or to reduce them to the condition oſ ſlaves. It would appear, however, that thoſe ſlaves were raiſed to the rank of citizens, or at leaſt that their burdens were much lightened, as ſoon as they were convinced of the truth of the Moſaic revelation, and received into covenant with God by the rite of circumciſion. They were then admitted to the celebration of the paſsover ; concerning which one law was decreed to the ſtranger, and to him that was home-born Indeed, when we conſider who was the legiſlator of the Jews ; when we reflect upon the number oſ laws enacted to mitigate ſlavery among them, and call to mind the means by which the due execution of all their laws was enforced, (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Theology),</hi> we</p><p>cannot help being of opinion that the heathen, who was reduced to ſlavery in Judea, might be happier, if he pleaſed, than when living as a freeman in his own country. But whether this be ſo or not, is a matter with which we have no concern. On account of the hardneſs of their hearts, and the peculiarity of their circumſtances, many things, of which ſlavery may have been one, were permitted to the Jews, which, if practiſed by Chriſtians, would render them highly guilty.</p><p>After treating thus largely of ſlavery in general, we need not occupy much of the reader’s time with the</p></div></body></text></TEI>
