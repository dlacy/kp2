in natural hiſtory, a hard, and, as it were, ſtony covering, with which certain animals are defended, and thence called sh <hi rend="italic">ell-fish.</hi></p><p>The Angular regularity, beauty, and delicacy in the ſtructure of the ſhells of animals, and the variety and brilliancy in the colouring of many of them, at the ſame time that they ſtrike the attention of the moſt incurious obſervers, have at all times excited philoſophers to inquire into and detect, if poſſible, the cauſes and manner of their formation. But the attempts of naturaliſts, ancient and modern, to diſcover this proceſs, have conſtantly proved unſucceſsful. M. de Reaumur hitherto appears alone to have given a plauſible account, at leaſt, of the formation of the ſhell of the garden-ſnail in particular, founded on a courſe of very ingenious experiments, related in the Paris Memoirs<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m]* See Mem. de l'Acad. annee 1709. p. 475. Edit de Hollande, in 12mo.</p></note> *. He there endeavours to ſhow, that this ſubſtance is produced merely by the perſpirable matter of the animal condenſing and afterwards hardening on its ſurface, and accordingly taking the figure of its body, which has performed the office of a mould to it ; in ſhort, that the ſhell of a ſnail, and, as he ſuppoſed, of all other animals poſe<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0358.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0352"/>
sessed of ſhells, was only the product of a viſcous tranſudation from the body of the animal, containing earthy particles united by mere juxtaposition. This hypothesis, however, is liable to very great and inſurmountable difficulties, if we apply it to the formation of ſome of the most common shells : for how, according to this ſyſtem, it may be aſked, can the oyſter, for inſtance, conſidered ſimply as a mould, form to itſelf a covering ſo much exceeding its own body in dimensions ?</p><p>M. Heriſſant, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Sciences for 1766, has diſcovered the ſtructure of ſhells to be organical. In the numerous experiments that he made on an immenſe number, and a very great variety, of animal ſhells, he conſtantly found that they were compoſed of two diſtinct ſubſtances ; one of which is a cretaceous or earthy matter ; and the other appeared, from many experiments made upon it by burning, diſtillation, and otherwiſe, to be evidently of an animal nature. Theſe two ſubſtances he dexterouſly ſeparated from each other by a very eaſy chemical analyſis ; by the gentle operation of which they were exhibited diſtinctly to view, without any material alteration from the action of the ſolvent, or inſtrument employed for that purpoſe. On an entire shell or a fragment of one, contained in a glass veſſel, he poured a ſufficient quantity of the nitrous acid, conſiderably diluted either with water or ſpirit of wine. After the liquor has diſſolved all the earthy part of the ſhell (which may be collected after precipitation by a fixed or volatile alkali), there remains floating in it a ſoft ſubstance, conſiſting of innumerable membranes of a retiform appearance, and dispoſed, in different ſhells, in a variety of poſitions, which conſtitutes the animal-part of it. This, as it has not been affected by the ſolvent, retains the exact figure of the ſhell ; and, on being viewed through a microſcope, exhibits ſatisfactory proofs of a vaſcular and organical ſtructure. He ſhows that this membranous ſubſtance is an appendix to the body of the animal, or a continuation of the tendinous fibres that compoſe the ligaments by which it is fixed to its ſhell ; and that this laſt owes its hardneſs to the earthy particles conveyed through the veſſels of the animal, which fix themſelves into, and incruſt, as it ware, the meſhes formed by the reticular filaments of which this membranous ſubſtance is compoſed. In the ſhell called porcelaines in particular, the delicacy of theſe membranes was ſo great, that he was obliged to put it into ſpirit of wine, to which he had the patience to add a single drop of ſpirit of nitre day by day, for the space of two months ; left the air generated, or let looſe by the action of the acid on the earthy ſubſtance, ſhould tear the compages of its fine membranous ſtructure into ſhatters ; as it certainly would have done in a more haſty and leſs gentle diſſolution. The delicate reticulated film, left after this operation, had all the tenuity of a ſpider’s web ; and accordingly he does not attempt to delineate its organization. Jn other ſhells he employed even five or six months in demonſtrating the complicated membranous ſtructure of this animal-ſubſtance by this kind of chemical anatomy. In general, however, the proceſs does not require much time.</p><p>Of the many ſingular configurations and appearances of the membranous part of different ſhells, which arc deſcribed in this memoir, and are delineated in ſeveral well executed plates, we ſhall mention only, as a ſpecimen, the curious membranous ſtructure obſerved in the lamiae of mother-of-pearl, and other ſhells of the ſame kind, after having been expoſed to the operation of the author’s ſolvent. Beside the great variety of fixed or permanent colours with which be found the animal-filaments of theſe shells to be adorned, it is known, that the ſhell itſelf prefects to the view a ſucceſſion of rich and changeable colours, the production of which he easily explains from the configurations of their membranes. Nature, he obſerves, always magnificent in her designs, but Angularly frugal in the execution of them, produces theſe brilliant decorations at a very ſmall expence. The membranous ſubſtance a- bove-mentioned is plaited and rumpled, as it were, in ſuch a manner, that its exterior laminae, incruſted with their earthy and ſemi-tranſparent matter, form an infinite number of little prisms, placed in all kinds of directions, which refract the rays of light, and produce all the changes of colour obſervable in theſe shells.</p><p>With respect to the figures and colours of ſhells, it is obſerved, that river shells have not ſo agreeable or diversified a colour as the land and ſea ſhells ; but the variety in the figure, colours, and other characters of ſea ſhells, is almost infinite. The number of diſtinct ſpecies we find in the cabinets of the curious is very great ; and doubtleſs the deep bottoms of the ſea, and the ſhores yet unexplored contain multitudes ſtill unknown to us. Even the same ſpecies differ in ſome degree in almoſt every individual ; ſo that it is rare to find any two ſhells which are alike in all respects.</p><p>This wonderful variety, however, is not all the produce of one ſea or one country ; the different parts of the world afford us their different beauties. Bonani obſerves, that the moſt beautiful ſhells we are acquainted with come front the Eaſt Indies and from the Red ſea. This is in ſome degree countenanced by what is found to this day; and from the general obſervations of the curious, it ſeems, that the ſun, by the great heat that it gives to the countries near the line, exalts the colours of the ſhells produced there, and gives them a luſtre and brilliancy that thoſe of colder climates always want : and it may be, that the waters of thoſe vaſt ſeas, which are not subject to be weakened by freſh rivers, give a nouriſhment to the fiſh, that may add to the brilliancy of their ſhells.</p><p>The shores of Asia furniſh us with. the pearl-oyſters and ſcallops in great perfection. About Amboyna are found the moſt beautiful ſpecimens of the cabbage-shell, the arroſoir, the ducal mantle, and the coral oysters, or echinated oyſters. Here alſo are found a great variety of extremely beautiful muſcles, tellinæ, and volutas ; ſome fine buccſhums, and the ſhell called the Ethiopian crown, in its greateſt perfection. The dolia, the murices, and the cassandræ, are alſo found on theſe coaſts in great beauty. Many elegant ſnails and ſcrew-ſhellas are alſo brought from thence ; and finally, the ſerapion and spider-ſhells. The Maldive and Philippine islands, Bengal, and the coaſt of Malabar, abound with the moſt elegant of all the ſpecies of ſnails, and furniſh many other kinds of ſhells in great abundance and perfection. China abounds in the fineſt ſpecies of porcelain ſhells, and has alſo a great variety of beautiful ſnails. Japan furniſhes us with all the thicker and larger bivalves ; and the isle of Cyprus is famous above all other parts of the world for the beauty and variety of the patella or limpet found there.<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0359.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0353"/>
America affords many very elegant shells, but neither in ſo great abundance nor beauty as the ſhores of Aſia. Panama is famous for the cylinders or rhombi, and we have beſide, from the ſame place, ſome good porcelains, and a very fine ſpecies of dolium, or concha globoſa, called from this place the Panama purple ſhell, One of the most beautiful of the cylinders is alſo known among our naturalists under the name of the Panama ſhell. About Braſil, and in the gulf of Mexico, there are found murices and dolia of extreme beauty ; and alſo a great variety of porcelains, purpuras, pectens, neritæ, bucardiae or heart-ſhells, and elegant limpets. The file of Cayenne affords one of the moſt beautiful of the buccinum kind, and the Midas ear is found principally about this place. Jamaica and the iſland of Barbadoes have their ſhores covered with porcelains, chamæ, and buccina ; and at St Domingo there are found almoſt all the ſame ſpecies of shells that we have from the Eaſt Indies; only they are leſs beautiful, and the colours more pale and dead. The pearl-oyſter is found alſo on this coaſt, but ſmaller than in the Perſian gulf. At Martinico there are found in general the ſame ſhells as at St Domingo, but yet leſs beautiful. About Canada are found the violet chamæ, and the lakes of that country abound with muſcles of a very elegant pale blue and pale red colours. Some ſpecies of theſe are remarkably light and thin ; others are very thick and heavy. The Great Bank of Newfoundland is very barren in ſhells :the principal kind found there are muſeles of ſeveral ſpecies, ſome of which are of considerable beauty. About Carthagena there are many mother-of-pearl ſhells, but they are not of ſo brilliant colours as thoſe of the Perſian gulf. The iſland of Magellan, at the ſouthern point of America, furnishes us with a very remarkable ſpecies of muſcle called by its name ; and ſeveral very elegant ſpecies of limpets are found there, particularly the pyramidal.</p><p>In Africa, on the coaſt of Guinea, there is a prodigious quantity of that ſmall ſpecies of porcelain which is uſed there as money ; and there is another ſpecies of porcelain on the ſame coaſt which is all over white ; the women make bracelets of theſe, and the people of the Levant adorn their hair with them. The coaſt of Zanguebar is very rich in ſhells : we find there a vaſt variety of the large porcelains, many of them of great Beauty ; and the nux marts or ſea-nut is very frequent there. Beſide theſe, and many other shells, there are found on this coaſt all the ſpecies of nautili, many of which are very beautiful. The Canary iſles abound with a vaſt variety of the murices, and ſome other good ſhells ; and we have from Madeira great variety of the echini or ſea-eggs different from thoſe of the European ſeas. Several ſpecies of muſcles are alſo common there, and the auris marina is nowhere more abundant. The Red ſea is beyond all other parts of the world abundant in ſhells, ſcarce any kind is wanting there ; but what we principally have from thence are the purpuras, porcelains, and echini marini.</p><p>The Mediterranean and Northern ocean contain a great variety of shells, and many of very remarkable elegance and beauty ; they are upon the whole, however, greatly inferior to thoſe of the Eaſt Indies. The Mediterranean abounds much more in ſhells than the Ocean. The gulf of Tarentum affords great variety of purpurae, of porcelains, nautili, and elegant oyſters; the coaſts of Naples and Sardinia afford alſo the ſame, and</p><p>with them a vaſt number of the ſolens of all the known ſpecies. The iſland of Sicily is famous for a very elegant kind of oyſter which is white all over ; pinnæ marinæ and porcelains are alſo found in great plenty there, with tellinæ and chamæ of many ſpecies, and a great variety of other beautiful ſhells. Corſica is famous, beyond all other places, for vaſt quantities of the pinnæ marinæ ; and many other very beautiful ſhells are found there. (Lister, Hiſt Conchyl.) About Syracuſe are found the gondola ſhell, the alated murex, and a great variety of elegant ſnails, with ſome of the dolia and neritæ. The Adriatic ſea, or gulf of Venice, is leſs furniſhed with ſhells than almoſt any of the ſeas thereabout, Muſeles and oyſters of ſeveral ſpecies are however found there, and ſome of the cordiſorm or heart- ſhells; there are alſo ſome tellinæ. About Ancona there are found vaſt numbers of the pholades buried in ſtone ; and the aures marinæ are particularly frequent about Puzzoli. (Bοnani, Recreat. Ment. et Ocul).</p><p>The ports of Marſeilles, Toulon, and Antibes, are full of pinnæ marinæ, muſeles, tellinæ, and chamæ. The coaſts of Bretagne afford great numbers of the conchæ anatiferæ and pouccepieds ; they are found on old rotten boards, on ſea ſubſtances, and among cluſters of sponges. The other ports of France, as Rochelle, Dunkirk, Breſt, St Maloes, and others, furnish oyſters excellent for the table, but of the common kind, and of no beauty in their ſhells ; great numbers of muſeles are alſo found there ; and the common tellinæ, the onion-peel oyſters, the ſolens, and conchæ anatiferæ, are alſo frequent there. At Granville, in Lower Normandy, there are found very beautiful pectens, and ſome of the cordiform or heart- ſheils.</p><p>Our own Engliſh coaſts are not the leaſt fruitful in ſhells, tho’ they do not produce ſuch elegantly painted ones as the Indies. About Plymouth are found oyſters, muſeles, and ſolens, in great abundance; and there, and on moſt of our other ſhores, are numbers of the aures marinæ and dentalia, with pectens, which are excellent food; and many elegant ſpecies of the chamæ and tellinæ are fiſhed up in the ſea about Scarborough and other places. Ireland affords us great numbers of muſeles, and some very elegant ſcallop-ſhells in great abundance, and the pholades are frequent on most of our ſhores. We have alſo great variety of the buccina and cochleæ, ſome volutæ; and, on the Guernſey coaſt, a peculiarly beautiful ſnail, called thence the Guernſey-ſnail.</p><p>The coaſts of Spain and Portugal afford much the ſame ſpecies of ſhells with the Eaſt Indies, but they are of much fainter colours, and greatly inferior in beauty. There are, according to Tavernier and others, ſome rivers in Bavaria in which there are found pearls of a fine water. About Cadiz there are found very large pinnæ marinæ, and ſome fine bucciua. The iſles of Majorca and Minorca afford a great variety of extremely elegant ſhells. The pinnæ marinæ are alſo very numerous there, and their silk is wrought into gloves, ſtockings, and other things. The Baltic affords a great many beautiful ſpecies, but particularly an orange-coloured pecten, or ſcallop-ſhell, which is not found in any other part of the world.</p><p>The freſh water ſhells are found much more frequently, and in much greater plenty than the ſea kinds ; there is ſcarce a pond, a ditch, or a river of freſh water in any part of the world in which there<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0360.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0354"/>
are not found vaſt numbers of theſe ſhells with the fiſh living in them. All theſe ſhells are ſmall, and they are of very little beauty, being uſually of a plain greyiſh or browniſh colour. Our ditches afford us chamse, buccina, neritae, and ſome patellæ ; but the Nile, and ſome other rivers, furniſhed the ancients with a ſpecies of tellina which was large and eatable, and ſo much ſuperior to the common ſea tellina in flavour, that it is commonly known by the name of <hi rend="italic">tellina regia,</hi></p><p>“ the royal tellina.” We have a ſmall ſpecies of buccinum common in our freſh waters, which is very elegant, and always has its operculum in the manner of the larger buccina ; a ſmall kind of muſcle is alſo very common, which is ſo extremely thin and tender, that it can hardly be handled without breaking to pieces. The large freſh water muſcle, commonly called in England the <hi rend="italic">horſe-muſcle,</hi> is too well known to need a deſcription; and the ſize ſufficiently diſtinguiſhes it from all other freſh water ſhells.</p><p>In collecting shells, it is most adviſable, whenever it can be done, to get thoſe which have in them the living animals ; becauſe we ſhall thus obtain the natural hiſtory of the animals, and the ſhells themſelves in their natural beauty, and the full glow of their colours. Shells ſhould be alſo procured from the deeper parts of their resorts, and immediately after storms on the ſea beaches and ſhores; becauſe, by being much expoſed to the ſun, their colours fade, and they are liable to other accidents that injure them. In order to kill the fiſh that inhabits them, Mr Da Coſta advises to give them a quick dip in boiling water, and when they are cooled, to lay them in cold water till they are cleaned ; and in this operation they ſhould not be touched with aquafortis, or any other acid, nor expoſed to the heat of the fire and ſun.</p><p>The art of poliſhing shells arrived but lately at its preſent ſtate of perfection ; and as the love of ſea-ſhells is become ſo common among us, it may not be diſagreeable to the reader to find ſome inſtructions in executing ſo pleaſing a method of adding to their natural beauty, the rules for which are at preſent ſo little known, though the effect of them be ſo much eſteemed.</p><p>Among the immenſe variety of ſhells which we are acquainted with, ſome are taken up out of the ſea, or found on its ſhores in all their perfection and beauty ; their colours being all ſpread by nature upon the ſurface, and their natural poliſh ſuperior to any thing that art could give. Where nature is in herſelf thus perfect, it were madneſs to attempt to add any thing to her charms : but in others, where the beauties are latent and covered with a coarſer outer ſkin, art is ſo be called in ; and the outer veil being taken off, all the internal beauties appear.</p><p>Among the ſhells which are found naturally poliſhed are the porcelains, or cowries ; the cassanders ; the dolia, or conchæ globosæ, or tuns ; ſome buccina, the volutes, and the cylinders, or olives, or, as they are generally though improperly called, the <hi rend="italic">rhombi ;</hi> excepting only two or three, as the tiara, the plumb, and the butter-tub rhombus, where there is an unpromiſing film on the ſurface, hiding a very great ſhare of beauty within. Though the generality of the ſhells of theſe genera are taken out of the ſea in all their beauty, and in their utmoſt natural poliſh, there are ſeveral other genera, in which all or moſt of the ſpecies are taken up naturally rough and foul, and covered with an epidermis, or coarſe</p><p>outer ſkin, which is in many rough and downy or hairy. The tellinæ, the muſcles, the cochleæ, and many others, are of this kind. The more nice collectors, as naturaliſts, insist upon having all their ſhells in their native and genuine appearance, as they are found when living at ſea; but the ladies, who make collections, hate the diſagreeable outſides, and will have all ſuch poliſhed.</p><p>It would be very adviſable, however, for both kinds of collectors to have the same ſhells in different ſpecimens both rough and poliſhed : the naturaliſt would by this means, beſides knowing the outſide of the ſhell, be better acquainted with its internal characters than he otherwiſe could be, and the lady would have a pleaſure in comparing the beauties of the ſhell, in its wrought ſtate, to its coarſe appearance as nature gives it. How many elegancies in this part of the creation must be wholly lost to us, if it were not for the aſſiſtance of an art of this kind ! Many ſhells in their native ſtate are like rough diamonds ; and we can form no just idea of their beauties till they have been poliſhed and wrought into form.</p><p>Though the art of poliſhing ſhells is a very valuable one, yet it is very dangerous to the ſhells ; for without the utmoſt care, the means uſed to poliſh and beautify a ſhell often wholly deſtroy it. When a ſhell is to be poliſhed, the firſt thing to be examined is whether it have naturally a ſmooth ſurface, or be covered with tubercles or prominences.</p><p>A ſhell which has a ſmooth ſurſace, and a natural dull poliſh, need only be rubbed with the hand, or with a piece of chamoy leather, with ſome tripoli, or fine rotten ſtone, and will become of a perfectly bright and fine poliſh. Emery is not to be uſed on this occaſion,. becauſe it wears away too much of the ſhell. This operation requires the hand of an experienced perſon, that knows how ſuperficial the work muſt be, and where he is to flop ; for in many of theſe ſhells the lines are only on the ſurface, and the wearing away ever ſo little of the ſhell defaces them. A ſhell that is rough, foul, and cruſty, or covered with a tartareous coat, muſt be left a whole day ſteeping in hot water: when it has imbibed a large quantity of this, it is to be rubbed with rough emery on a ſtick, or with the blade of a knife, in order to get off the coat. After this, it may be dipped in diluted aquafortis, ſpirit of ſalt, or any other acid; and after remaining a few moments in it, be again plunged into common water. This will add greatly to the ſpeed of the work. After this it is to be well rubbed with linen cloths, impregnated with common ſoap ; and when by theſe ſeveral means it is made perfectly clean, the poliſhing is to be finished with fine emery and a hair-bruſh. If aber this the ſhell when dry appears not to have ſo good a poliſh as was desired, it muſt be rubbed over with a ſolution of gum arabic ; and this will add greatly to its gloſs, without doing it the ſmalleſt injury. The gum-water muſt not be too thick, and then it gives no ſenſible coat, only heightening the colours. The white of an egg anſwers this purpoſe alſo very well ; but it is ſubject to turn yellow. If the ſhell has an epidermis, which will by no means admit the poliſhing of it, it is to be dipped ſeveral times in diluted aquafortis, that this may be eaten off ; and then the ſhell is to be poliſhed in the uſual way with putty, fine emery, or tripoli, on the hair of a fine bruſh. When it is only a pellicle that hides the colours, the ſhells muſt be ſteeped in hot water, and after that the<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0361.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0355"/>
ſkin worked off by degrees with an old file, This is the caſe with ſeveral of the cylinders, which have not the natural poliſh of the reſt.</p><p>When a ſhell is covered with a thick and fatty epidermis, as is the caſe with ſeveral of the muſcles and tellinae ; in this caſe aquafortis will do no ſervice, as it will not touch the ſkin : then a rough bruſh and coarſe emery are to be uſed ; and if this does not ſucceed, seal-ſkin, or, as the workmen call it, fish-skin and pu <hi rend="italic">miceſtone,</hi> are to be employed.</p><p>When a ſhell has a thick cruſt, which will not give way to any of theſe means, the only way left is to plunge it ſeveral times into strong aquafortis, till the stubborn cruſt is wholly eroded. The limpets, auris marina, the helmet-ſhells, and ſeveral other ſpecies of this kind, muſt have this fort of management ; but as the deſign is to ſhow the hidden beauties under the cruſt, and not to deſtroy the natural beauty and poliſh of the inside of the ſhell, the aquafortis muſt be uſed in this manner : A long piece of wax muſt be provided, and one end of it made perfectly to cover the whole mouth of the ſhell ; the other end will then ſerve as a handle, and the mouth being flopped by the wax, the liquor cannot get in to the inside to ſpoil it ; then there muſt be placed on a table a veſſel full of aquafortis, and another full of common water.</p><p>The ſhell is to be plunged into the aquafortis ; and after remaining a few minutes in it, is to be taken out, and plunged into the common water. The progreſs the aquafortis makes in eroding the ſurface is thus to be carefully obſerved every time it is taken out : the point of the ſhell, and any other tender parts, are to be covered with wax, to prevent the aquafortis from eating them away ; and if there be any worm- holes, they alſo muſt be ſtopped up with wax, otherwiſe the aquafortis would ſoon eat through in thoſe places. When the repeated dippings into the aquafortis ſhow that the coat is ſufficiently eaten away, then the ſhell is to be wrought carefully with fine emery and a bruſh ; and when it is poliſhed as high as can be by this means, it muſt be wiped clean, and rubbed over with gum-water or the white of an egg. in this fort of work the operator muſt always have the caution to wear gloves; otherwiſe the leaſt touch of the aquafortis will burn the fingers, and turn them yellow ; and often, if it be not regarded, will eat off the ſkin and the nails.</p><p>Theſe are the methods to be uſed with ſhells which require but a moderate quantity of the ſurface to be taken off ; but there are others which require to have a larger quantity taken off, and to be uncovered deeper: this is called entirely ſcaling a ſhell. This is done by means of a horizontal wheel of lead or tin, impregnated with rough emery ; and the ſhell is wrought down in the same manner in which ſtones are wrought by the lapidary. Nothing is more difficult, however, than the performing this work with nicety: very often ſhells are cut down too far by it, and wholly ſpoiled ; and to avoid this, a coarſe vein muſt be often left Handing in ſome place, and taken down afterwards with the file, when the cutting it down at the wheel would have ſpoiled the adjacent parts.</p><p>After the ſhell is thus cut down to a proper degree, it is to be poliſhed with fine emery, tripoli, or rotten stone, with a wooden wheel turned by the ſame machine</p><p>as the leaden one, or by the common method of working with the hand with the ſame ingredients. When a ſhell is full of tubercles, or protuberances, which muſt be preſerved, it is then impoſſible to uſe the wheel : and if the Common way of dipping into aquafortis be attempted, the tubercles being harder than the reſt of the ſhell, will be eat through before the reſt is ſufficiently ſcaled, and the ſhell will be ſpoiled. In this caſe, induſtry and patience are the only means of effecting a poliſh. A camel's hair pencil muſt be dipped in aquafortis ; and with this the intermediate parts of the ſhell muſt be wetted, leaving the protuberances dry : this is to be often repeated ; and after a few moments the ſhell is always to be plunged into water to ſtop the eroſion oſ the acid, which would otherwiſe eat too deep, and deſtroy the beauty of the ſhell. When this has ſufficiently taken off the foulneſs of the ſhell, it is to be poliſhed with emery of the fineſt kind, or with tripoli, by means of a ſmall ſtick, or the common poliſhing-ſtone uſed by the goldſmiths may be uſed.</p><p>This is a very tedious and troubleſome thing, eſpecially when the echinated oyſters and murices, and ſome other ſuch ſhells, are to be wrought : and what is worſt of all is, that when all this labour has been employed, the buſiness is not well done ; for there still remain ſeveral places which could not be reached by any inſtrument, ſo that the ſhell muſt necessarily be rubbed over with gum-water or the white of an egg afterwards, in order to bring out the colours and give a gloſs ; in ſome cases it is even necessary to give a coat of varniſh.</p><p>Theſe are the means uſed by artiſts to brighten the colours and add to the beauty of ſhells ; and the changes produced by poliſhing in this manner are ſo great, that the ſhell can ſcarcely be known afterwards to be the ſame it was ; and hence we hear of new ſhells in the cabinets of collectors, which have no real exiſtence as ſeparate ſpecies, but are (hells well known, diſguiſed by poliſhing. To caution the reader againſt errors of this kind, it may be proper to add the most remarkable ſpecies thus uſually altered.</p><p>The onyx-ſhell or volute, called by us the <hi rend="italic">purple</hi> or <hi rend="italic">violet-tip,</hi> which in its natural ſtate is of a simple pale brown, when it is wrought slightly, or polished with just the ſuperficies taken off, is of a fine bright yellow; and when it is eaten away deeper, it appears of a fine milk-white, with the lower part bluiſh : it is in this ſtate that it is called the <hi rend="italic">onyx-shell ;</hi> and it is preſerved in many cabinets in its rough ſtate, and in its yellow appearance, as different ſpecies of ſhells.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">violet shells,</hi> ſo common among the curious, is a ſpecies of porcelain, or common cowry, which does not appear in that elegance till it has been poliſhed ; and the common auris marina shows itſelf in two or three different forms, as it is more or leſs deeply wrought. In its rough ſtate it is duſky and coarſe, of a pale brown on the outside, and pearly within ; when it is eaten down a little way below the ſurface, it shows variegations of black and green ; and when it ill farther eroded, it appears of a fine pearly hue within and without.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">nautilus,</hi> when it is poliſhed down, appears all over of a fine pearly colour ; but when it is eaten away but to a ſmall depth, it appears of a fine yellowiſh colour with duſky hairs. The burgau, when entirely cleared of its coat, is of the most beautiful pearl co-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0362.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0356"/>
lour ; but when but ſlightly eroded, it appears of a variegated mixture of green and red ; whence it has been called the <hi rend="italic">parroquet shell.</hi> The common helmet- ſhell, when wrought, is of the colour of the fineſt agate ; and the muſcles, in general, though very plain ſhells in their common appearance, become very beautiful when poliſhed, and ſhow large veins of the moſt elegant colours. The Persian ſhell, in its natural ſtate, is all over white, and covered with tubercles ; but when it has been ground down on a wheel, and poliſhed, it appears of a grey colour, with spots and veins of a very bright and highly poliſhed white. The limpets, in general, become very different when poliſhed, moſt of them ſhowing very elegant colours ; among theſe the tortoiſe ſhell limpet is the principal ; it does not appear at all of that colour or tranſparence till it has been wrought.</p><p>That elegant ſpecies of ſhell called the <hi rend="italic">junquil-chama,</hi> which has deceived ſo many judges of these things into an opinion of its being a new ſpecies, is only a white chama with a reticulated ſurface ; but when this is poliſhed, it loses at once its reticular work and its colour, and becomes perfectly ſmooth, and of a fine bright yellow. The violet coloured chama of New England, when worked down and poliſhed, is of a fine milk-white, with a great number of blue veins, dispoſed like the variegations in agates.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">asses-ear ſhell,</hi> when poliſhed after working it down with the file, becomes extremely gloſſy, and obtains a fine roſe-colour all about the mouth. Theſe are ſome of thc moſt frequent among an endleſs variety of changes wrought on ſhells by poliſhing ; and we find there are many ot the very greateſt beauties of this part of the creation which must have been lost but for this method of ſearching deep in the ſubſtance of the ſhell for them.</p><p>The Dutch are very fond of ſhells, and are very nice in their manner of working them : they are under no reſtramt, however, in their works ; but uſe the moſt violent methods, ſo as often to deſtroy all the beauty of the ſhell. They file them down on all fides, and often take them to the wheel, when it must deſtroy the very characters of the ſpecies. Nor do they ſtop at this : but, determined to have beauty at any rate, they are ſor improving upon nature, and frequently add ſome lines and colours with a pencil, afterwards covering them with a fine coat of varniſh, ſo that they ſeem the natural lineations of the ſhell: the Dutch cabinets are by theſe means made very beautiful, but they are by no means to be regarded as inſtructors in natural hiſtory. There are ſome artificers of this nation who have a way of covering ſhells all over with a different tinge ſrom that which nature gives them ; and the curious are often enticed by theſe tricks to purchaſe them for new ſpecies.</p><p>There is another kind of work beſtowed on certain ſpecies of ſhells, particularly the nautilus ; namely, the engraving on it lines and circles, and figures of liars, and other things. This is too obvious a work of art to ſuffer any one to ſuppoſe it natural. Buonani has figured ſeveral of theſe wrought ſhells at the end of his work ; but this was applying his labour to very little purpoſe; the ſhells are ſpoiled as objects of natural hiſtory by it, and the engraving is ſeldom worth any thing.— They are principally done in the Eaſt Indies,</p><p>Shells are ſubject to ſeveral imperfections ; ſome of which are natural and others accidental. The natural defects are the effect of age, or fickneſs in the fiſh. The greateſt miſchief happens to ſhells by the fiſh dying in them. The curious in theſe things pretend to be always able to diſtinguiſh a ſhell taken up with the fiſh alive from one found on the ſhores : they call the firſt a <hi rend="italic">living,</hi> the ſecond a <hi rend="italic">dead</hi> ſhell ; and say that the colours are always much fainter in the dead ſhells. When the ſhells have lain long dead on the ſhores, they are ſubject to many injuries, of which the being eaten by ſea-worms is not the leaſt : age renders the finest ſhells livid or dead in their colours.</p><p>Beſides the imperfections ariſing from age and sickneſs in the fiſh, ſhells are ſubject to other deformities, ſuch as morbid cavities, or protuberances, in parts where there ſhould be none. When the ſhell is valuable, theſe faults may be hid, and much added to the beauty of the ſpecimen, without at all injuring it as an object of natural hiſtory, which ſhould always be the great end of collecting theſe things. The cavities may be filled up with maſtic, diſſolved in spirit of wine, or with isinglaſs : theſe ſubſtances muſt be either coloured to the tinge of the ſhell, or elſe a pencil dipped in water-colours muſt finiſh them up to the reſemblance of the rest ; and then the whole ſhell being rubbed over with gum-water, or with the white of an egg, ſcarce any eye can perceive the artifice : the same ſubſtances may alſo be uſed to repair the battered edge of a ſhell provided the pieces chipped off be not too large. And when the excreſcences of a ſhell are faulty, they are to be taken down with a fine file. If the lip of a ſhell be ſo battered that it will not admit of repairing by any cement, the whole muſt be filed down or ground on the wheel till it become even.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Fossil</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Shells.</hi> Those found buried at great depths in the earth.</p><p>Of theſe ſome are found remaining almoſt entirely in their native ſtate, but others are variouſly altered by being impregnated with particles of ſtone and of other foſſils ; in the place of others there is found mere ſtone or ſpar, or ſome other native mineral body, expreſſing all their lineaments in the moſt exact manner, as having been ſormed wholly from them, the ſhell having been first deposited in ſome ſolid matrix, and thence dissolved by very slow degrees, and this matter left in its place, on the cavities of ſtone and other ſolid ſubſtances, out of which ſhells had been diſſolved and waſhed away, being afterwards filled up leſs ſlowly with theſe different ſubſtances, whether ſpar or whatever elſe ; theſe ſubſtances, ſo filling the cavities, can neceſſarily be of no other form than that of the ſhell, to the abſence of which the cavity was owing, though all the nicer lineaments may not be ſo exactly expressed. Beſides theſe, we have alſo in many places maſſes of ſtone formed within various ſhells ; and theſe having been received into the cavities of the ſhells while they were perfectly fluid, and having therefore nicely filled all their cavities, muſt retain the perfect figures of the internal part of the ſhell, wſhen the ſhell itſelf ſhould be worn away or periſhed from their outſide. The various ſpecies we find of theſe are, in many genera, as numerous as the known recent ones ; and as we have in our own iſland not only the ſhells of our own ſhores, but thoſe of many other very diſtant ones, ſo we have<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0363.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0357"/>
also many ſpecies, and thoſe in great numbers, which are in their recent ſtate, the inhabitants of other yet unknown or unſearched seas and ſhores. The cockles, muſcles, oyſters, and the other common bivalves of our own ſeas, are very abundant : but we have also an amazing number of the nautilus kind, particularly of the nautilus græcorum, which though a ſhell not found living in our own or any neighbouring ſeas, yet is found buried in all our clay-pits about London and elſewhcre ; and the moſt frequent of all foſſil ſhells in ſome of our counties are the conchæ anomiæ, which yet we know not of in any part of the world in their recent ſtate. Of this fort also are the cornua ammonis and the gryphitæ, with ſeveral of the echinitæ and others.</p><p>The exact ſimilitude of the known ſhells, recent and foſſil, in their ſeveral kinds, will by no means ſuffer us to believe that theſe, though not yet known to us in their living ſtate, are, as ſome have idly thought, a lort of <hi rend="italic">luſus natures.</hi> It is certain, that of the many known ſhores, very few, not even thoſe of our own island, have been yet carefully searched for the ſhell-fiſh that inhabit them ; and as we ſee in the nautilus græcorum an inſtance of ſhells being brought from very diſtant parts of the world to be buried here, we cannot wonder that yet unknown ſhores, or the unknown bottoms of deep ſeas, ſhould have furniſhed us with many unknown ſhell-fiſh, which may have been brought with the rest ; whether that were at the time of the general deluge, or the effect of any other cataſtrophe of a like kind, or by whatever other means, to be left in the yet unhardened matter of our ſtony and clayey ſtrata.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Shells,</hi> in gunnery, are hollow iron balls to throw out of mortars or howitzers, with a fuſe-hole of about an inch diameter, to load them with powder, and to receive the fuſe. The bottom, or part oppoſite to the fuſe, is made thicker than the rest, that the fuſe may fall upoermoſt. But in ſmall elevations this does not always happen, nor indeed is it neceſſary ; for, let the ſhell fall as it will, the fuſe ſets fire to the powder within, which burſts the ſhell, and cauſes great devaſtation. The ſhells had much better be of an equal thickneſs ; for then they burſt into more pieces.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Meſſage.</hi> <hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Shells, are</hi> nothing more than howitz ſhells, in the inside of which a letter or other papers are put ; the fuſe hole is flopped up with wood or cork, and the ſhells are fired out of a royal or howitz, either into a garriſon or camp. It is supposed, that the perſon to whom the letter is ſent knows the time, and accordingly appoints a guard to look out for its arrival.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SHELL-Fish.</hi> Theſe animals are in general oviparous, very few inſtances having been found of ſuch as are viviparous. Among the oviparous kinds, anatomists have found that ſome ſpecies are of different ſexes, in the different individuals of the same ſpecies ; but others are hermaphrodites, every one being in itſelf both male and female. In both cafes their increaſe is very numerous, and ſcarce inferior to that of plants, or of the moſt fruitful of the infect claſs. The eggs are very ſmall, and are hung together in a sort of clutters by means of a glutinous humour, which is always placed about them, and is of the nature of the gelly of frog’s ſpawn. By means of this, they are not only kept together in the parcel, but the whole clutter is fastened to the rocks, ſhells, or other ſolid ſubſtances ; and thus they are preſerved from being driven on ſhore by the waves, and left where they cannot ſucceed.
