<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the ultimate rules of conduct, and the coincidence of the two is maintained on the ground of the joys of knowledge.&nbsp;Knowledge has its natural consummation in the knowledge&nbsp;of God ; man’s knowledge of God is at the same time the&nbsp;love and gratitude which he, as representative of the&nbsp;creatures and mediator between them and God, continually&nbsp;offers to the divine majesty. The fact that self-love and the&nbsp;love of God are at present often in conflict is traced by&nbsp;Raymond to the fall of the first human pair ; and this&nbsp;gives him occasion to deduce the doctrine of the incarnation, almost in the words of Anselm’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Cur Deus homo.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAYNAL, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Guillaume Thomas François </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1713-1796), was born on 12th April 1713 in the province of Rouergue,&nbsp;and was educated at Pézenas by the Jesuits. He took&nbsp;orders, and, going to Paris, did parish work ; but he left&nbsp;the priesthood (being indeed deprived for misconduct)&nbsp;and betaking himself to literature soon became one of&nbsp;the minor members of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">philosophe</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> coterie. He did not&nbsp;a little journalism and bookmaking of divers kinds ; but&nbsp;his name would be entirely forgotten were it not for the&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire philosophique et politique des Établissements et du&nbsp;Commerce des Européens dans les Deux Indes.</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> This book&nbsp;is not, and indeed was not in its own day, of any substantive value as a book of reference on its nominal subject ;&nbsp;but it exercised considerable influence : it was exceedingly&nbsp;characteristic of the period and society which produced it,&nbsp;and passages of it are still worth reading. The secret of&nbsp;its merits and its faults is to be found in the manner of&nbsp;its composition. Raynal himself wrote but a small part&nbsp;of it, and he took not the slightest pains to make it a homogeneous work. But he borrowed from books and he begged&nbsp;from his own friends all manner of diatribes against superstition and tyranny, often illustrated by lively anecdotes&nbsp;and eloquent tirades. Grimm assigns a full third of the&nbsp;book to Diderot, which is probably an exaggeration, but&nbsp;that Diderot had a great hand in it no judge of style can&nbsp;doubt. It was published in 1772, and brought the author&nbsp;many compliments, even from men like Gibbon, who should&nbsp;have known better. A new edition in 1780 was even&nbsp;bolder. It was condemned and burned (29th May 1781),&nbsp;and the author had to fly the country. He returned just&nbsp;before the Revolution, but having apparently a natural&nbsp;tendency to opposition he became a strong Royalist. He&nbsp;died on 6th March 1796.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">No other work of Raynal’s deserves notice here. The best account in English of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Histoire des Indes</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> will be found in Mr John&nbsp;Morley’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Diderot,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> vol. ii. chap. xv.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RAZORBILL or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Razor-billed Auk, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">known also on many parts of the British coasts as the Marrot, Murre,&nbsp;Scout, Tinker, or Willock—names which it, however, shares&nbsp;with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Guillemot </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(vol. xi. p. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">262), </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">and to some extent&nbsp;with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Puffin </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(see above, p. </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">101)—a </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">common sea-bird of&nbsp;the Northern Atlantic,@@<sup>1</sup> resorting in vast numbers to certain&nbsp;stations on rocky cliffs for the purpose of breeding, and,&nbsp;its object being accomplished, returning to deeper waters&nbsp;for the rest of the year. It is the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Alca tor da</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> of Linnæus @@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>and most modern authors, congeneric with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Gare-fowl&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(vol. x. p. 78), if not with the true Guillemots, between&nbsp;which two forms it is intermediate—differing from the&nbsp;former in its small size and retaining the power of flight,</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@1</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Schlegel </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">{Mus. des Pays-Bas, Urinatores,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> p. 14) records an example&nbsp;from Japan ; but this must be in error.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>@@@2</sup> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The word </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Alca</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> is simply the Latinized form of this bird’s common&nbsp;Teutonic name, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Aik,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> of which Auk is the English modification. It&nbsp;must therefore be held to be the type of the Linnsean genus </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Alca,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">though some systematists on indefensible grounds have removed it&nbsp;thence, making it the sole member of a genus named by Leach, after&nbsp;Aldrovandus (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ornithologia,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> bk. xix. chap, xlix.), </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Utamania</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—an extraordinary word, that seems to have originated in some mistake from&nbsp;the no less extraordinary </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Vuttamaria,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> given by Belon (</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Observations,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">i. c. xi.) as the Cretan name of some diving bird, which certainly&nbsp;could not have been the present species.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">which that presumably extinct species has lost, and from the latter in its peculiarly-shaped bill, which is vertically&nbsp;enlarged, compressed, and deeply furrowed, as well as in&nbsp;its elongated, wedge-shaped tail. A fine white line, running on each side from the base of the culmen to the eye,&nbsp;is in the adult bird in breeding-apparel (with a few very&nbsp;rare exceptions) a further obvious characteristic. Otherwise the appearance of all these birds may be briefly&nbsp;described in the same words—head, bi’east, and upper&nbsp;parts generally of a deep glossy black, and the lower parts&nbsp;and tip of the secondaries of a pure white, while the&nbsp;various changes of plumage dependent on age or season&nbsp;are alike in all. In habits the Razorbill closely agrees&nbsp;with the true Guillemots, laying its single egg (which is&nbsp;not, however, subject to the same amazing variety of&nbsp;coloration that is pre-eminently the Guillemot’s own) on&nbsp;the ledges of the cliffs to which it repairs in the breeding-season, but it is said then as a rule to occupy higher elevations, and when not breeding to keep further out to sea.&nbsp;On the east side of the Atlantic the Razorbill has its&nbsp;stations on convenient parts of the coast from the North&nbsp;Cape to Britanny, besides several in the Baltic, while in&nbsp;winter it passes much further to the southward, and is&nbsp;sometimes numerous in the Bay of Gibraltar, occasionally&nbsp;entering the Mediterranean but apparently never extending&nbsp;to the eastward of Sicily or Malta. On the west side of&nbsp;the Atlantic it breeds from 70° N. lat. on the eastern shore&nbsp;of Baffin’s Bay to Cape Farewell, and again on the coast&nbsp;of America from Labrador and Newfoundland to the Bay&nbsp;of Fundy, while in winter it reaches Long Island, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">(a. n.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RÉ, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Isle of, </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">a long, low island </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3 </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">miles </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">off </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the coast of the French department of Charente Inférieure, runs&nbsp;south-east and north-west with a breadth of about 3 miles&nbsp;and a length of 18£ miles. The north-west point (Pointe&nbsp;des Baleines) has a lighthouse of the first class. The&nbsp;Pertuis Breton separates the island from the coast of La&nbsp;Vendée to the north, and the Pertuis d’Antioche from the&nbsp;Isle of Oléron to the south. With a surface of 18,259&nbsp;acres, the Isle of Ré has 15,370 inhabitants, whose chief&nbsp;source of income is the salt marshes, producing annually&nbsp;31,500 tons of salt. The island has also a vineyard and&nbsp;corn lands, and boasts of the excellence of its figs, pears,&nbsp;and cream. Apart from the orchards it is now woodless,&nbsp;though once covered with forests. Oysters are successfully cultivated, the annual supply of these molluscs being&nbsp;35,000,000. The coast facing the Atlantic is rocky and&nbsp;inhospitable, but there are numerous harbours on the landward side. The island seems once to have been united&nbsp;to the continent, with which it is still connected by a line&nbsp;of sunken rocks ; its existence is not mentioned before&nbsp;the 8th century. Tradition says that the city of Antioche&nbsp;on the west coast was destroyed by the Atlantic storms,&nbsp;which still constantly threaten to cut the island in two at&nbsp;the isthmus (only 230 feet wide) formed by the gulf&nbsp;called Fier d’Ars. There are two cantons—St Martin and&nbsp;Ars-en-Ré—in the arrondissement of La Rochelle. St&nbsp;Martin, with a secure harbour, was fortified by Vauban, and&nbsp;is the depot for convicts on their way to New Caledonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">READE, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Charles </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1814-1884), holds a high and distinctive place among the English novelists of the third quarter of the 19th century. The son of an Oxfordshire&nbsp;squire, he was born at Ipsden in 1814, and was educated&nbsp;for the bar. He entered Magdalen College, Oxford, proceeded B.A. in 1835, with a third class in classics, was&nbsp;elected Vinerian Reader in 1842, and was called to the&nbsp;bar (Lincoln’s Inn) in 1843. It was comparatively late&nbsp;in his life that he made his first appearance as an author,&nbsp;but he showed at once that he had subjected himself to a&nbsp;laborious apprenticeship to the study of life and literature.</span></p>
