<p><span class="font0">similar technical qualities, poetry and pathos. The group comprises paintings by which Rossetti is best known, such as “ Proserpina in Hades,” which is, on the whole, perhaps the&nbsp;most original, if not indeed the most poetical and powerful, of&nbsp;all his output; “ Sibylla Palmífera,” “ Venus Verticordia,”&nbsp;“ Lilith ” (the better of the two versions is now referred to),&nbsp;“Washing Hands,” “ Monna Vanna,” “Il Ramoscello,”&nbsp;“ Aurea Catena,” “ La Pia,” “ Rosa Triplex,” “ Veronica&nbsp;Veronese,” “ La Ghirlandata,” “ Pandora,” “ The Blessed&nbsp;Damozel,” and, last and largest, but not, perhaps, the greatest&nbsp;of his paintings (a distinction for which “ The Bride ” and&nbsp;“ Proserpina ” must contend), the famous “ Dante’s Dream,”&nbsp;now in the Walker Art Gallery at Liverpool. Besides these,&nbsp;Rossetti produced a large number of fine things. Nearly the&nbsp;whole of them were exhibited by the Royal Academy and at the&nbsp;Burlington Fine Art Club in 1883, after their author’s death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(F.G.S.)]</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile, the literary side of Rossetti had developed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pari passu</span><span class="font0"> with his achievements as a painter. The goal before&nbsp;the young Rossetti’s eyes was to reach through art the forgotten&nbsp;world of old romance—that world of wonder and mystery and&nbsp;spiritual beauty which the old masters knew and could have&nbsp;painted had not lack of science, combined with slavery to&nbsp;monkish traditions of asceticism, crippled their strength. In&nbsp;that great rebellion against the renascence of classicism which&nbsp;(after working much good and much harm) resulted in 18th-century materialism—in that great movement of man’s soul&nbsp;which may be appropriately named “ the Renascence of the&nbsp;Spirit of Wonder in Poetry and Art ”—he had become the&nbsp;acknowledged » protagonist before ever the Pre-Raphaelite&nbsp;brotherhood was founded, and so he remained down to his&nbsp;last breath. It was by inevitable instinct that Rossetti turned&nbsp;to that mysterious side of nature and man’s life which to other&nbsp;painters of his time had been a mere fancy-land, to be visited,&nbsp;if at all, on the wings of sport. For if there is any permanent&nbsp;vitality in the Renascence of Wonder in modem Europe, if&nbsp;it is really the inevitable expression of the soul of man in a&nbsp;certain stage of civilization (when the sanctions which have&nbsp;made and moulded society are found to be not absolute and&nbsp;eternal, but relative, mundane, ephemeral and subject to the&nbsp;higher sanctions of unseen powers that work behind “ the&nbsp;shows of things ”), then perhaps one of the first questions to&nbsp;ask in regard to any imaginative painter of the 19th century is,&nbsp;In what relation did he stand to the newly awakened spirit&nbsp;of romance ? Had he a genuine and independent sympathy&nbsp;with that temper of wonder and mystery which all over Europe&nbsp;had preceded and now followed the temper of imitation, prosaic&nbsp;acceptance, pseudo-classicism and domestic materialism? or&nbsp;was his apparent sympathy with the temper of wonder, reverence and awe the result of artistic environment dictated to&nbsp;him by other and more powerful and original souls around&nbsp;him?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We do not say that the mere fact of a painter’s or a poet’s showing but an imperfect sympathy with the Renascence&nbsp;of Wonder is sufficient to place him below a poet in whom&nbsp;that sympathy is more nearly complete, but we do say that,&nbsp;other things being equal or anything like equal, a painter or&nbsp;poet of this time is to be judged very much by his sympathy&nbsp;with that great movement, which we call the Renascence of&nbsp;Wonder because the word “ romanticism ” never did express&nbsp;it even before it had been vulgarized by French poets, dramatists, doctrinaires and literary harlequins. To struggle against&nbsp;the prim traditions of the 18th century, the unities of Aristotle,&nbsp;the delineation of types instead of characters, as Chateaubriand, Madame de Staël, Balzac and Hugo struggled, was&nbsp;well. But in studying Rossetti’s works we reach the very key&nbsp;of those “ high palaces of romance ” which the English mind&nbsp;had never, even in the 18th century, wholly forgotten, but&nbsp;whose mystic gates no Frenchman ever yet unlocked. Not&nbsp;all the romantic feeling to be found in all the French romanticists (with their theory that not earnestness but the grotesque is the life-blood of romance) could equal the romantic&nbsp;spirit expressed in a single picture or drawing of Rossetti’s,&nbsp;such, for instance, as Beata Beatrix or Pandora. For, while&nbsp;the French romanticists—inspired by the theories (drawn&nbsp;from English exemplars) of Novalis, Tieck and Herder—&nbsp;cleverly simulated the old romantic feeling, the “ beautifully&nbsp;devotional feeling ” which Holman Hunt speaks of, Rossetti&nbsp;was steeped in it: he was so full of the old frank childlike&nbsp;wonder and awe which preceded the great renascence of materialism that he might have lived and worked amidst the old&nbsp;masters. Hence, in point of design, so original is he that to&nbsp;match such ideas as are expressed in “ Lilith,” “ Hesterna Rosa,”&nbsp;“ Michael Scott’s Wooing,” the “ Sea Spell,” &amp;c., we have to turn&nbsp;to the sister art of poetry, where only we can find an equally&nbsp;powerful artistic representation of the idea at the core of the&nbsp;old romanticism—the idea of the evil forces of nature assailing&nbsp;man through his sense of beauty. We must turn, we say,&nbsp;not to art—not even to the old masters themselves—but to&nbsp;the most perfect efflorescence of the poetry of wonder and&nbsp;mystery—to such ballads as the “ Demon Lover,” to Coleridge’s&nbsp;“ Christabel ” and “ Kubla Khan,” to Keats’s “ La Belle Dame&nbsp;sans Merci,” for parallels to Rossetti’s most characteristic&nbsp;designs. Now, although the idea at the heart of the highest&nbsp;romantic poetry (allied perhaps to that apprehension of the&nbsp;warring of man’s soul with the appetites of the flesh which&nbsp;is the basis of the Christian idea) may not belong exclusively&nbsp;to what we call the romantic temper (the Greeks, and also&nbsp;most Asiatic peoples, were more or less familiar with it, as we&nbsp;see in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sal&amp;mdn and Absal</span><span class="font0"> of Jami), yet it became peculiarly&nbsp;a romantic note, as is seen from the fact that .in the old masters&nbsp;it resulted in that asceticism which is its logical expression&nbsp;and which was once an inseparable incident of all romantic&nbsp;art. But in order to express this stupendous idea as fully&nbsp;as the poets have expressed it, how is it possible to adopt the&nbsp;asceticism of the old masters ? This is the question that&nbsp;Rossetti asked himself, and answered by his own progress in&nbsp;art. In all of his pictures, the poorest and the best, is displayed that power which Blake calls vision—the power which,&nbsp;as he finely says, is “ surrounded by the daughters of inspiration,” the power, that is, of seeing imaginary objects and&nbsp;dramatic actions—physically seeing them as well as mentally—&nbsp;and flashing them upon the imaginations (even upon the corporeal senses) of others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mr W. M. Rossetti (in the Preface to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Collected Works, </span><span class="font0">r886) has given an interesting account of his brother’s literary&nbsp;nurturing. Shakespeare, Walter Scott, Byron, the Bible&nbsp;were the earliest influences: then Shelley, Mrs Browning,&nbsp;the older English and Scottish ballads, and Dante. Afterwards he preferred Keats to Shelley. By 1847 he was “ deep&nbsp;in Robert Browning.” Malory’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Morte d* Arthur,</span><span class="font0"> about 1856,&nbsp;engrossed him; Victor Hugo and De Musset, among French&nbsp;poets, were his delight. In his last years he had an enthusiasm&nbsp;for Chatterton. From childhood’s days he had loved to compose, but </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Germ</span><span class="font0"> (1850) contained Rossetti’s first published prose or verse. In it appeared “ The Blessed Damozel,”&nbsp;the prose poem “ Hand and Soul,” six sonnets and four lyrics.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The Blessed Damozel ” was written so early as 1847 <sup>or </sup>1848.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Sister Helen ” was produced in its original form in</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">1850 or 1851. His translations from the early Italian poets also began as far back as 1845 or 1846, and may have been&nbsp;mainly completed by 1849. He published a volume of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The&nbsp;Early Italian Poets (Dante and his Circle)</span><span class="font0"> in 1861. In 1856&nbsp;he contributed to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Oxford and Cambridge Magazine,</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;which among other things the “ Burden of Nineveh ” appeared.&nbsp;Materials for a volume of original poetry accumulated slowly,&nbsp;and these having been somewhat widely read in manuscript&nbsp;had a very great influence upon contemporary poetic literature long before their appearance in print. He had intended&nbsp;to publish a volume in 1862, but the death of his wife (see&nbsp;below) caused its postponement till 1870. In poetry no less&nbsp;than in art what makes Rossetti so important a figure is the&nbsp;position he took up with regard to the modern revival of the&nbsp;“ romantic ” spirit.
