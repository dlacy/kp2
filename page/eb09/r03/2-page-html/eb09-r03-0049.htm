        <p><span class="font2">consuls,@@<sup>1</sup> and a curse was invoked upon the man who I
                should injure or impede the tribune in the performance of&nbsp;his
                    duties.@@<sup>2</sup> The number of tribunes was at first two, then&nbsp;five,
                and before 449 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                >b.c.</span><span class="font2"> it had been raised to ten. The&nbsp;fact that the
                institution of the tribunate of the plebs was&nbsp;the one result of the first
                secession is strong evidence that&nbsp;the object of the seceders was not economic
                or agrarian&nbsp;reform but protection against the consuls. The tribunate&nbsp;gave
                them this protection in a form which has no parallel in&nbsp;history. The tribune
                was not, and, strictly speaking, never&nbsp;became, a magistrate of the Roman
                people. His one proper&nbsp;prerogative was that of granting protection to the
                oppressed&nbsp;plebeian against a patrician officer. This prerogative
                (jus&nbsp;auxilii) was secured to the tribunes, not by the
                ordinary&nbsp;constitution, but by a special compact between the orders,&nbsp;and
                was protected by the ancient oath (vetus jusjurandum),@@<sup>3&nbsp;</sup>which
                invoked a curse upon the violator of a tribune. This&nbsp;exceptional and anomalous
                right the tribunes could only&nbsp;exercise in person, within the limits of the “
                pomoerium,”&nbsp;and against individual acts of magisterial oppression.@@<sup>4
                </sup>It&nbsp;was only gradually that it expanded into the later wide&nbsp;power of
                interference with the whole machinery of government, and was supplemented by the
                legislative and judicial&nbsp;powers which rendered the tribunate of the last
                century&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">B.c. </span><span class="font2">so
                formidable, and the “tribunitia potestas” so essential an element in the authority
                of the emperors.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">But from the first the tribunes were for the plebs not only
                protectors but leaders, under whom they organized&nbsp;themselves in opposition to
                the patricians. The tribunes&nbsp;convened assemblies of the plebs (concilia
                plebis), and&nbsp;carried resolutions on questions of interest to the
                order.&nbsp;This incipient plebeian organization was materially advanced by the
                Publilian law of 471 </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;"
                    >b.c.,@@<sup>5</sup>
            </span><span class="font2">which appears&nbsp;to have formally recognized as lawful the
                plebeian concilia,&nbsp;and established also the tribune’s right “ cum plebe
                agere,”&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span
                class="font2"> to propose and carry resolutions in them. These&nbsp;assemblies were
                “ tributa,” or, in other words, the voting in&nbsp;them took place not by curies or
                centuries but by tribes.&nbsp;In them, lastly, after the Publilian law, if not
                before, the&nbsp;tribunes were annually elected.@@<sup>6</sup> By this law the
                foundations were laid both of the powerful “comitia tributa”@@<sup>7&nbsp;</sup>of
                later days and also of the legislative and judicial&nbsp;prerogatives of the
                tribunes. The patricians maintained&nbsp;indeed that resolutions (plebiscita)
                carried by tribunes in&nbsp;the concilia plebis were not binding on their order, but
                the&nbsp;moral weight of such resolutions, whether they affirmed a&nbsp;general
                principle or pronounced sentence of condemnation</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">on some single patrician, was no doubt considerable.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">It is at any rate certain that the passing of the Publilian law was
                followed by increased activity on the part of the&nbsp;tribunes. The attack on the
                consular authority was&nbsp;continued, and combined with it we have a
                persistent&nbsp;effort made to secure for the plebs their fair share of
                the&nbsp;common lands of the state (agri publici). The main object,&nbsp;however, of
                this early agrarian agitation was not economic&nbsp;but political. Membership in a
                tribe was now more than&nbsp;ever important for a plebeian, as giving a vote not
                only in&nbsp;the comitia centuriata but also in the plebeian “ concilia,”&nbsp;and
                membership in a tribe was possible as yet only for&nbsp;freeholders.@@<sup>8</sup>
                To increase the number of freeholders</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">became therefore a matter of importance, and the simplest mode of
                increasing the number of freeholders was for the&nbsp;state to create freeholds on
                the common lands. But such&nbsp;a policy met with bitter opposition from the
                patricians, who&nbsp;had long enjoyed a virtual monopoly of these lands,
                and&nbsp;had excluded the plebeians even from those more recently&nbsp;acquired
                tracts which they had helped to win by their&nbsp;swords. Against this patrician
                monopoly the tribunes&nbsp;unceasingly protested from a few years after the
                first&nbsp;secession down to 465 </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.@@<sup>9 </sup></span><span class="font2">In
                that year a compromise&nbsp;was effected by the colonization of Antium, which
                had&nbsp;been taken the year before, and the plebeians obtained&nbsp;land without
                any disturbance of patrician occupiers.&nbsp;Eleven years later the common lands on
                the Aventine&nbsp;were reclaimed and assigned to plebeians by a lex
                    Icilia.@@<sup>10</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">But this agrarian agitation, though destined subsequently to play an
                important part in the history, was for the time far less fruitful in results than
                that which was&nbsp;directed against the consular authority.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font2">The proposal of C. Terentilius Arsa (460 </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.)</span><span class="font2"> to appoint a
                plebeian commission to draw up laws restricting the&nbsp;powers of the
                    consuls@@<sup>11</sup> was resolutely opposed by the&nbsp;patricians, but after
                ten years of bitter party strife a&nbsp;compromise was effected. A commission of ten
                patricians&nbsp;was appointed, who should frame and publish a code of&nbsp;law
                binding equally on both the orders. These decemviri&nbsp;were to be the sole and
                supreme magistrates for the year,&nbsp;and the law of appeal was suspended in their
                    favour.@@<sup>12&nbsp;</sup>The code which they promulgated, the famous XII.
                Tables,&nbsp;owed little of its importance to any novelties or improvements
                contained in its provisions. For the most part it&nbsp;seems merely to have
                reaffirmed existing usages and laws&nbsp;(see </span><span class="font2"
                style="font-variant:small-caps;">Roman Law).</span><span class="font2"> But it
                substituted a public, written&nbsp;law, binding on all citizens of Rome, for an
                unwritten&nbsp;usage, the knowledge of which was confined to a few&nbsp;patricians,
                and which had been administered by this&nbsp;minority in their own interests. With
                the publication of&nbsp;the code the proper work of the decemvirs was
                finished;&nbsp;nevertheless for the next year a fresh decemvirate was&nbsp;elected,
                and it is conceivable that the intention was permanently to substitute government by
                an irresponsible&nbsp;patrician “council of ten” for the old constitution. However
                this may have been, the tyranny of the decemvirs&nbsp;themselves was fatal to the
                continuance of their power.&nbsp;We are told of a second secession of the plebs,
                this time to&nbsp;the Janiculum, and of negotiations with the senate,
                the&nbsp;result of which was the enforced abdication of the decemvirs. The plebs
                joyfully chose for themselves tribunes,&nbsp;and in the comitia centuriata two
                consuls were created.&nbsp;But this restoration of the old regime was accompanied
                by&nbsp;legislation which made it an important crisis in the history&nbsp;of the
                struggle between the orders. With the fall of the&nbsp;decemvirate this struggle
                enters upon a new phase. The&nbsp;tribunes appear as at once more powerful and more
                strictly&nbsp;constitutional magistrates; the plebeian “ concilia” take&nbsp;their
                place as formal comitia by the side of the older&nbsp;assemblies; and finally this
                improved machinery is used&nbsp;not simply in self-defence against patrician
                oppression&nbsp;but to obtain complete political equality. This change&nbsp;was no
                doubt due in part to circumstances outside legislation, above all to the expansion
                of the Roman state, which&nbsp;swelled the numbers and added to the social
                importance&nbsp;of the plebs as compared with the dwindling forces of the&nbsp;close
                corporation of patrician gentes. Still the legislation</span></p>
