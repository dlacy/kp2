They were for the most part men of the poorer classes, or leaders of the populace, but during the Terror public functionaries and persons of good education styled themselves <hi rend="italic">citoyens sans-culottes.</hi> The distinctive costume of the typical sans-culotte was the <hi rend="italic">pantalon</hi> (long trousers)—in place of the <hi rend="italic">culottes</hi> worn by the upper classes—the <hi rend="italic">carmagnole</hi> (short-skirted coat), the red cap of liberty and <hi rend="italic">sabots</hi> (wooden shoes). The influence of the Sans-culottes ceased with the reaction that followed the fall of Robespierre (July 1794), and the name itself was proscribed. In the Republican Calendar the complementary days at the end of the year were at first called <hi rend="italic">Sans-culottides;</hi> this name was, however, suppressed by the Convention when the constitution of the year III. (1795) was adopted, that of <hi rend="italic">jours complémentaires</hi> being substituted.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
