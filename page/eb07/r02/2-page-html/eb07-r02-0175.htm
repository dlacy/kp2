<p><span class="font1">was a circle of ground, called the Pomœrium, consecrated by the augurs, and held sacred ; and it was unlawful to build&nbsp;within its limits, or even to pass the plough over it.@@<sup>1</sup> This&nbsp;consecrated circle, however, was not necessarily preserved&nbsp;close to the walls, and it was frequently extended without&nbsp;any change being made in the walls themselves. But the&nbsp;boundaries of the city could only be enlarged by those who&nbsp;had made any acquisition of territory to the Roman state.@@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>The first who took advantage of this privilege was Sylla, and&nbsp;bis example was followed by Augustus, Claudius, Nero, and&nbsp;Trajan.@@<sup>3</sup> All their improvements, however, consisted in&nbsp;restoring or enlarging the Pomœrium ; and no change was&nbsp;made in the walls of Rome till the time of Aurelian, who&nbsp;built a wall round the city, and enlarged it so as to comprehend the Janiculum and the Pincian hill, with great part of&nbsp;the Campus Martius.@@<sup>4</sup> Various exaggerated accounts have&nbsp;been given of the walls of Aurelian, and antiquaries are&nbsp;much divided respecting them, but their probable compass&nbsp;appears to have been about twenty-one miles. The walls&nbsp;of Rome were repaired during the reign of the emperors&nbsp;Arcadius and Honorius. One-third of them was destroyed&nbsp;by Totila about the middle of the sixth century. His ravages were hastily restored with rude and dissimilar materials, by Belisarius, to stand the second siege. Since that&nbsp;period they have been so often shattered, repaired, and remodelled, that but little of their original structure can now&nbsp;remain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The number and situation of the ancient gates of the city are involved in hopeless obscurity. Rome at present has&nbsp;sixteen gates, including the four of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Citta Leoninα,</span><span class="font1"> but&nbsp;several of them have been walled up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Palatine mount is about a mile and a half in circuit, and is nearly square. The ruins of the successive edifices which have stood upon it have raised the soil&nbsp;around its base considerably above the ancient level. About&nbsp;one-half of the surface of it is called the Villa Famese,&nbsp;which occupies all the north-west side, and about one-half&nbsp;of the two sides contiguous, and is let and cultivated as a&nbsp;kitchen-garden. Adjoining, on the south, is the Villa Spada,&nbsp;which lies along a part of the west side overlooking the site&nbsp;of the Circus. Another part of the hill is covered by the&nbsp;upper and lower gardens. Roncioni, and the side opposite&nbsp;to the Cælian mount, is partly occupied by the convent and&nbsp;gardens of Saint Bonaventura. This celebrated spot, which&nbsp;contained the whole Roman people, till the destruction&nbsp;of the republic, was the site of the dwellings of her senators,&nbsp;and the temples of her gods. But the mansions of the&nbsp;Gracchi, of Hortensius, Crassus, Clodius, Catiline, Cicero,&nbsp;and many others, were all swept away, to make room for the&nbsp;palace of Augustus,@@<sup>5</sup> which is supposed to have stood on the&nbsp;north-west part of the Palatine, looking down on the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pulchrum littus,</span><span class="font1"> “the beautiful shore” near the Tiber. His&nbsp;successor, Tiberius, erected a dwelling for himself on the&nbsp;north side of the Palatine, looking into the Velabrum.@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>Another was built on the north-east corner fronting the Capitol by Caligula, who joined the Palatium and the Capitol&nbsp;by a bridge thrown across the Forum.@@<sup>7</sup> But by far the most</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">magnificent was the “ Domus Aurea,” erected by Nero. The only description on record of this gorgeous palace is that of&nbsp;Suetonius, which we shall give in his own words : “ In nothing was he so ruinous as in building. He erected a house&nbsp;extending from the Palatine as far as the Esquiliæ. At first&nbsp;he called it his House of Passage ; afterwards, when it had&nbsp;been destroyed by fire and restored again, he gave it the&nbsp;name of the Golden House. To form an idea ofits extent&nbsp;and magnificence, it may suffice to state tlle following particulars. The vestibule admitted his colossal statue, which&nbsp;was 120 feet high. The building was on so large a scale&nbsp;that it had a triple portico a mile long, also an immense pool&nbsp;like a sea, enclosed by buildings, presenting the appearance&nbsp;of towns. There were moreover grounds laid out for tillage, and for vineyards, and for pasturage and woods, and&nbsp;stocked with a vast number of every description of cattle&nbsp;and wild animals. In other respects, every thing was overlaid with gold, embellished with gems, and with mother-of-pearl. The ceilings of the banqueting-rooms were fretted&nbsp;into ivory coffers, made to turn, that flowers might be showered down upon the guests, and were furnished with pipes for&nbsp;discharging perfumes. The principal banqueting-room was&nbsp;round, and by a perpetual motion, day and night, was made&nbsp;to revolve after the fashion of the universe. There vzere&nbsp;baths streaming with salt and sulphurous waters.”@@<sup>8</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ On</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the ruins ofhis native country,” says Tacitus,@@<sup>9</sup> “ Nero erected a palace, in which the profusion of gold and precious stones&nbsp;did not raise the chief admiration, for these were ornaments&nbsp;that widely-diffused luxury had rendered common ; but universal astonishment was excited by its spacious glades, and&nbsp;large artificial lakes, by its thick woods and shades, like vast&nbsp;wildernesses, by its ample lawns and avenues, and far extended prospects.” The successors of Nero made various&nbsp;alterations on the imperial palace. It suffered by fire for&nbsp;the third time under Commodus.@@<sup>10</sup> The Goths and Vandals, in the fifth century, pillaged it of most of its treasures,&nbsp;but they do not appear to have rendered it uninhabitable ;&nbsp;for even so late as the beginning of the seventh century He-raclius held a state ceremony in the palace of the Cæsars.&nbsp;Its final destruction seems to have been in a great measure&nbsp;the work of the Farnese popes and princes, who carried off&nbsp;its materials to build their palaces and villas, and buried its&nbsp;magnificent halls beneath their wretched gardens. Many&nbsp;extensive chambers and halls have at different times been&nbsp;discovered, but after being rifled of their statues and ornaments, they have all been filled up again. The whole mount&nbsp;is now one mass of confused and undistinguishable ruins.&nbsp;The very soil is formed of crumbled brick-work. Nothing&nbsp;has been told, nothing can be told, to satisfy the belief of&nbsp;any but a Roman antiquary.</span></p>
