<p><span class="font0">have invented their tales of knights-errant, monſters, and giants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ De Saint Foix, in his Hiſtorical EiΓays on this ſubject, thus expreſſes himſelf: ‘ Women and girls were not in greater ſecurity when they paſſed by abbeys.&nbsp;The monks ſuſtained an aſſault rather than relinquiſh&nbsp;their prey: if they ſaw themſelves lofing ground, they&nbsp;brought to their walls the relics of ſome ſaint. Then it&nbsp;generally happened that the aſſailants, ſeized with awful veneration, retired, and dared not to purſue their&nbsp;vengeance. This is the origin of the enchanters, of&nbsp;the enchantments, and of the enchanted caſtles, deſcribed&nbsp;. in romances.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ To theſe may be added what the author of Northern Antiquities, Vol, I. p. 243, writes, that ‘ as the walls&nbsp;of the caſtles ran winding round them, they often called&nbsp;them by a name which ſignified </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ſrpents</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dragons;</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;in theſe were commonly ſecured the women and young&nbsp;maids of diſtinction, who were ſeldom ſafe at a time&nbsp;when ſo many bold warriors were rambling up and&nbsp;down in ſearch of adventures. It was this cuſtom&nbsp;which gave occaſion to ancient romancers, who knew&nbsp;not how to deſcribe any thing limply, to invent ſo&nbsp;many fables concerning princeſſes of great beauty,&nbsp;guarded by dragons.’</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ The Italian romances of the 14th century were ſpread abroad in great numbers. They formed the polite literature of the day. But if it is not permitted to&nbsp;authors freely to expreſs their ideas, and give full play&nbsp;to the imagination, theſe works muſt never be placed&nbsp;in the ſtudy of the rigid moraliſt. They indeed puſhed&nbsp;their indelicacy to the verge of groſſneſs, and ſeemed&nbsp;rather to ſeek than to avoid ſcenes which a modern&nbsp;would bluſh to deſcribe. They (to employ the expreſſion of one of their authors) were not aſhamed to name&nbsp;what God had created. Cinthio, Bandello, and others,&nbsp;but chiefly Boccacio, rendered libertiniſm agreeable,&nbsp;by the faſcinating charms of a poliſhed ſtyle, and a luxuriant imagination.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ This however muſt not be admitted as an apology for immoral works ; for poiſon is ſtill poiſon, even when&nbsp;it is delicious. Such works were, and ſtill continue&nbsp;to be, the favourites of a nation which is ſtigmatiſed&nbsp;for being prone to illicit pleaſures and impure amours.&nbsp;They are. ſtill curious in their editions, and are not par*&nbsp;ſimonious in their price for what they call an uncaſtra-ted copy. There are many Italians, not literary men,&nbsp;who are in poſſeſſion of an ample library of theſe old&nbsp;noveliſts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ If we paſs over the moral irregularities of theſe romances, we may diſcover a rich vein of invention, which only requires to be releaſed from that rubbiſh which&nbsp;disfigures it to become of an invaluable price. The&nbsp;Decamerons, the Hecatommiti, and the Novellas of theſe&nbsp;writers, made no inconſiderable figure in the little library of our Shakeſpeare. Chaucer is a notorious imitator and lover of them; his Knight’s Tale is little more&nbsp;than a paraphraſe of Boccacio’s <sup>r</sup>Γefeoide. Fontaine&nbsp;has caught all their charms with all their licentiouſneſs.&nbsp;From ſuch works, theſe great poets, and many of their&nbsp;contemporaries, frequently borrowed their plots ; not&nbsp;uncommonly kindled at their flame the ardour of their&nbsp;genius ; but bending too ſubmiſſively to their own peculiar taſte, or that of their age, in extracting the ore,&nbsp;they haγe not purified it of the alloy.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">“ We muſt now turn our contemplation to the Frendh romances of the laſt century. They were then carried&nbsp;to a point of perfection, which as romances they cannot exeeed. To this the Aſtyea of D’Urſe greatly&nbsp;contributed. It was &quot;followed by the illuſtrious Baſſa,&nbsp;the great Cyrus, Clelia, &amp;c. which, though not adapt”&nbsp;ed to the preſent age, gave celebrity to their authors.&nbsp;Their ſtyle, as well as that of the Aſtrea, is diffuſe and&nbsp;inſipid. Zaide (attributed by ſome to Segrais, but by&nbsp;Huet to Madame La Fayette) and the princeſs of&nbsp;Cleves are tranſlated, and though they are maſterpieces&nbsp;of the kind, were never popular in our country, and&nbsp;are little adapted to its genius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ It is not ſurpriſing that romances have been regarded as pernicious to good ſenſe, morals, taſte, and literature. It was in this light they were conſidered by Boileau ; becauſe a few had ſucceeded, a croud imitated their examples. Gombervilk and Scudery, and a&nbsp;few more were admired ; but the ſatiiiſt diſſolved the&nbsp;illuſion. 1 his he did moſt effectually by a dialogue,&nbsp;in which he ridicules thoſe citizens of a certain diſtrict,&nbsp;whoſe characters were concealed in theſe romances, under the names of Brutus, Horace Codes, Lucretius,&nbsp;and Clelia. This dialogue he only read to his friends,&nbsp;and did not give it ſor a long time to the public, as&nbsp;he eſteemed mademoiſelle de Scudery : but when at&nbsp;length it was publiſhed, it united all the romance writers againſt our ſatiriſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ From romances, which had now exhauſted the patience of the public, ſprung novels. They attempted to allure attention by this inviting title, and reducing<sup>-</sup>their works from ten to two volumes. The name of&nbsp;romance diſguſted ; and they ſubſtituted thoſe of hiſtories, lives, memoirs, and adventures. In theſe works&nbsp;(obſerves Irail) they quitted the unnatural incidents,&nbsp;the heroic projects, the complicated and endleſs intrigues, and the exertion of noble paſſions ; heroes were&nbsp;not now taken from the throne, they were ſought for&nbsp;even amongſt the loweſt ranks of the people. On this&nbsp;ſubject, I ſhall juſt obſerve, that a novel is a very dangerous poiſon in the hand of a libertine ; it may be a&nbsp;ſalutary medicine in that of a virtuous writer.” See&nbsp;Novel.</span></p>
