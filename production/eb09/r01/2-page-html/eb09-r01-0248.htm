<p><span class="font2">zoological nomenclature. The labours of Wiegmann, Müller, Duméril, and Bibron exercised no influence on him, and&nbsp;when he commenced to publish a new system of Reptiles&nbsp;in 1843, @@<sup>1</sup> of which fortunately one fasciculus only appeared,&nbsp;he exhibited a classification in which morphological facts&nbsp;are entirely superseded by fanciful ideas of the vaguest&nbsp;kind of physiosophy, each class of vertebrates being divided&nbsp;into five “sense ” series, and each series into three orders,&nbsp;one comprising forms of superior, the second of medium,&nbsp;and the third of inferior development. In the generic&nbsp;arrangement of the species, to which Fitzinger devoted&nbsp;himself especially in this work, he equally failed to&nbsp;advance science. From a superficial study of such species&nbsp;as were accessible to him, but chiefly from the descriptions&nbsp;of other authors, he selected any characters for the&nbsp;establishment of genera, and, abandoning entirely the value&nbsp;of a genus as a systematic category, he introduced a&nbsp;number of names, under the cloak of which he hid the&nbsp;superficiality of his work; many were adopted by his successors, who, however, had to substantiate their validity&nbsp;by a deeper study of the taxonomic characters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We have now arrived at a period distinguished by the appearance of a work which, by the ability of its authors,&nbsp;by the comprehensiveness of its scope, by the treatment&nbsp;of the general subject as well as of the details, superseded&nbsp;all its predecessors, which formed the basis for the labours&nbsp;of many succeeding years, and which will always remain&nbsp;one of the classical monuments of descriptive zoology, —&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Erpétologie Générale ou Histoire Naturelle complète des&nbsp;Reptiles</span><span class="font2"> of A. M. C. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Duméril </span><span class="font2">and G. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bibron </span><span class="font2">(Paris, 8vo).&nbsp;The first volume appeared in 1834, and the ninth and last&nbsp;in 1854. No naturalist of that time could have been better&nbsp;qualified for the tremendous undertaking than C. Duméril,&nbsp;who almost from the first year of half a century’s connexion with the then largest collection of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reptilia</span><span class="font2"> had&nbsp;chiefly devoted himself to their study. The task would&nbsp;have been too great for the energy of a single man; it was,&nbsp;therefore, fortunate for Duméril that he found a most&nbsp;devoted fellow-labourer in one of his assistants, G. Bibron,&nbsp;whose abilities equalled those of the master, but who,&nbsp;to the great loss of science, died (in 1848) before the&nbsp;completion of the work. Duméril had the full benefit of&nbsp;Bibron’s knowledge for the volumes containing the Snakes,&nbsp;but the last volume, which treats of the Tailed Batrachians,&nbsp;had to be prepared by Duméril alone.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The work is the first which gives a comprehensive scientific account of Reptiles generally, their structure,&nbsp;physiology, and literature. Nearly the whole of the first&nbsp;volume is devoted to these chapters. And again each of&nbsp;the four orders admitted by the authors is introduced by&nbsp;a similar general account. In the body of the work 121&nbsp;Chelonians, 468 Saurians, 586 Ophidians, and 218 Batra-chians are described in detail and with the greatest precision, On the principles of arrangement of the various&nbsp;orders we shall have to speak subsequently, and we mention here only that, singularly enough, the authors revert&nbsp;to Brongniart’s arrangement, in which the Batrachians&nbsp;are co-ordinate with the other three orders of Reptiles. @@<sup>2&nbsp;</sup>This must appear all the more strange as Von Baer@@<sup>3</sup> in&nbsp;1828, and J. Müller@@<sup>4</sup> in 1831, had urged, besides other&nbsp;essential differences, the important fact that no Batrachian</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

<p><span class="font2">4.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Period of the Separation of Reptiles and Batrachiam as Distinct Classes or Subclasses. </span><span class="font2">—In the chronological order&nbsp;which we have adopted for these historical notes, we had&nbsp;to refer in their proper places to two herpetologists,&nbsp;Blainville and Latreille, who advocated a deeper than&nbsp;merely ordinal separation of Reptiles from Batrachians,&nbsp;and who were followed by F. S. Leuckart. But this&nbsp;view only now began to find more general acceptance. J.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Müller </span><span class="font2">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Stannius </span><span class="font2">were guided in their classification&nbsp;entirely by anatomical characters, and consequently recognized the wide gap which separates the Batrachians from&nbsp;the Reptiles; yet they considered them merely as subclasses of the class </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Amphibia.</span><span class="font2"> The former directed his&nbsp;attention particularly to those forms which seemed to&nbsp;occupy an intermediate position between Lacertilians and&nbsp;Ophidians, and definitely relegated </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anguis, Pseudopus</span><span class="font2">,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Acontias</span><span class="font2"> to the former, and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Typhlops, Rhinophis, Tortrix,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">but also the Amphisbaenoids to the latter.

H. Huxley to demonstrate,&nbsp;not merely that the weight of facts demanded such a class&nbsp;separation, but that the Reptiles hold the same relation to&nbsp;Birds as the Batrachians to Fishes. In his Hunterian&nbsp;Lectures (1863) he divided the vertebrates into Mammals,&nbsp;Sauroids, and Ichthyoids, subsequently substituting for the&nbsp;last two the terms </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sauropsida</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ichthyopsida. @@7</span><span class="font2"> The</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
