The Catholics are few in number.</p><p>Catholics abound in Russia, but mostly in the Polish provinces, where they are not only freely tolerated, but enjoy every political right in common with other subjects. Their number may amount to about 12,000,000, or l-5th of the population of the empire.</p><p>In Italy, Spain, and Portugal, popery is dominant and exclusive ; but other religions, though not legally tolerated, are not now persecuted.</p><p>In Turkey and Greece popery is fully tolerated, but professed by few if by any of the natives.</p><p>In America popery is the dominant religion of all the late Spanish and Portuguese colonies. In some of them no other religion is tolerated <hi rend="italic">by law,</hi>  but nobody is persecuted for professing any other. In the United States of North America, there are about 800,000 Catholics. In Lower Canada, they form the majority of the population.</p><p>In Great Britain popery is now not merely tolerated, but Roman Catholics are admitted to equal, or nearly equal, political rights witll Protestants.</p><p>In 1837, the total number of Catholics throughout the world, was reckoned by Adrien Balbi at 1.39,000,000, out of 737,000,000, which he considers to be the total population of the globe.</p><p>Before the passing of tile various Roman Catholic Emancipation Acts, the Catholics in Great Britain and Ireland were subjected to a system of stringent penal laws. The laws in force against them, previously to the Act 18 Geo. III. cap. 60; and 31 Geo. III. cap. 32, may be divided into three classes: 1. Those respecting persons professing popery. 2. Those respecting popish recusants convict. 3. Those respecting popish priests.</p><p>I.    Persons professing popery, besides the penalties for not attending their parish church, were disabled from taking their lands by either descent or purchase, after eighteen years of age, until they renounced tbeir errors ; were obliged at twenty-one to register their estates before acquired, and all future conveyances and wills relating to them ; were incapable of presenting to any advowson, or granting to any other person any avoidance of the same ; might not keep or teach any school under pain of perpetual imprisonment; and if they willingly heard or said mass, they forfeited for the one 100, and tor the other 200 marks, and were to suffer a year’s imprisonment. If any evil industry was used to rivet the errors of popery upon those who already professed it ; if any person sent another abroad to be educated in popery, or to reside in any religious house for that purpose, or contributed to his maintenance when there, the sent, the sender, and the contributor, were disabled to sue in law or equity, to be executor or administrators to any person, or to bear any office in the realm, and forfeited all their goods and chattels, and likewise all their real estate for life. Where these errors were aggravated by apostacy or perversion, where a person was reconciled to the see of Rome, or procured others to be reconciled, the offence amounted to high treason.</p><p>II.    Popish recusants convicted in a court of law of not attending the service of the Church -of England, were subject to the following disabilities, penalties, and forfeitures, over and above those before mentioned. They were considered as persons excommunicated; they could hold no office or employment ; if they kept arms in their houses, the same might be seized by the Justices of the Peace ; they might not come within ten miles of London, under the penalty ol’L 100; could bring no action at law or suit in equity; were not allowed to travel above five miles from home, unless by licence, upon pain of forfeiting all their goods; and they might not come to court under the penalty of L.100. No marriage or burial of such recusant, or baptism of his child, should be had otherwise than by the ministers of the Church of England, underother severe penalties. A married woman, when recusant, forfeited two-thirds of her dower or jointure, and might not be executrix, or administratrix to her husband, or have any part of his goods; and during the coverture might be kept in prison, unless her husband redeemed her at the rate of L.l 0 a month, or the third part of all his lands. And, lastly, as <hi rend="italic">a.femme couverte</hi>  (married woman) recusant might be imprisoned, so all others must, within three months after conviction, either submit, and renounce their errors, or, if required so to do by four justices, abjure and renounce the realm ; and if they did not depart, or if they returned without the king’s licence, they should be guilty of felony, without benefit of clergy. There w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>as also an inferior kind of recusancy, (refusing to make the declaration against popery enjoined by Act 30 Car. II. cap. 2, when tendered by the proper magistrate,) which, if the party resided within ten miles of London, made him an absolute recusant convict ; or, if at a greater distance, suspended him from having any seat in Parliament, keeping arms in his house, or any horse above the value of L.5.</p><p>III. Popish priests were placed in a still more slavish situation. For, by statute 11 and 12 Wil. III. c. 4, popish priests or bishops celebrating mass, and exercising any part of their functions in England, except in the houses of ambassadors, were liable to perpetual imprisonment. And by the statute 27 Eliz. c. 2, any popish priest bom in the dominions of the crown of England, who should come hither from beyond sea, or should be in England without conforming, and taking the oaths, was guilty of high treason ; and all persons harbouring him were guilty of felony without benefit of clergy.</p><p>The first amendment of these inhuman laws, which affix an everlasting stain on the British name, was effected by the statute 18 Geo. III. c. 60. With regard to such papists as should duly take the oath therein prescribed, of allegiance to his Majesty, abjuration of the Pretender, renunciation of the Pope’s civil power, and abhorrence of the doctrines of destroying and not keeping faith with heretics, and deposing or murdering princes excommunicated by authority of the see of Rome, the statute 11 and 12 W. III. was repealed, so far as it disabled them from purchasing or inheriting, or authorized the apprehending or prosecuting of the popish clergy, or subjected them or any teachers of youth to perpetual imprisonment. By the statute 31 Geo. III. c. 32. all the restrictions and penalties above enumerated, were removed from those Catholics who were willing to comply with the requisitions of that statute, which were, that they must appear at some of the courts of Westminster, or at the quarter sessions held for the county, city, or place where they might reside, and make and subscribe a declaration that they professed the Roman Catholic religion, and also an oath exactly similar to that required by 18 Geo. III. c. 60. On this declaration and oath being duly made by any Roman Catholic, the officer of the court was authorised to grant him a certificate ; and such officer was required yearly to transmit to the Privy Council lists of all persons who had thus qualified themselves within the year in his court. Roman Catholics thus qualified were not to be prosecuted under any statute for not repairing to a parish church, nor for attending or performing mass or other ceremonies of the Church <hi rend="italic">οi'</hi>  Rome. But no Roman Catholic minister was to officiate in any place of worship having a steeple and bell, or at any funeral in a churchyard, or was to wear the habits of his order, except in a place allow ed by the statute, or in a private house where there should not be more than five persons besides the family. No person who had qualified was to be prosecuted for instructing youth, except in an endowed school, or in one of the English universities ; or in the case of receiving into his school the child of any Protestant father; and no Roman Catholic was to keep a school until his or her name should be recorded as a teacher at the sessions.</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
