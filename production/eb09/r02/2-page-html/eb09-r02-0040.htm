<p><span class="font1">We must now explain how the respiratory muscles effect these movements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">How the Inspiratory Movements are Produced.—The Rib Movements.—</span><span class="font1">These are caused by the contraction of muscles&nbsp;which are fixed either to the central axis of the body&nbsp;(including under that term the head and vertebral column)&nbsp;or to some point rendered sufficiently stable for the purpose by the action of other adjuvant muscles. Thus the&nbsp;M. levatores costarum arise from the transverse processes of&nbsp;the 7th cervical and eleven upper dorsal vertebræ, and are&nbsp;attached to the ribs below in series ; the M. scaleni spring&nbsp;from the cervical vertebræ, and are attached to the&nbsp;anterior parts of the first and second ribs ; he M. sterno-cleido-mastoidei arise from the side and back of the skull,&nbsp;and are inserted into the upper part of the sternum and the&nbsp;clavicle ; the M. pectoralis minor arises from the coracoid&nbsp;process of the scapula, and is inserted into the anterior&nbsp;ends of some of the ribs ; the M. serratus posticus superior&nbsp;arises from certain of the cervical and dorsal vertebræ, and&nbsp;is inserted into the posterior part of certain of the ribs ;&nbsp;the M. cervicalis ascendens (part of the M. erector spinæ)&nbsp;arises from certain of the cervical vertebræ, and is inserted&nbsp;into the posterior part of certain ribs. The M. serratus&nbsp;magnus and the M. pectoralis major, which are affixed on&nbsp;the one hand to the upper arm and to the scapula respectively and on the other to the ribs and to the sternum&nbsp;respectively, may in certain elevated positions of the arm&nbsp;and shoulder act as in</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">spiratory muscles. When</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">all these muscles contract,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the ribs are raised in the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">twofold way already de</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">scribed, some pulling up</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the anterior ends of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ribs, and others causing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the arched ribs to rotate</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">about an axis passing</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">through their vertebral</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and sternal joints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the muscles just enumerated the M. intercostales externi are undoubtedly inspiratory muscles. Every external intercostal muscular fibre between a pair of ribs must, when&nbsp;it contracts, of necessity raise&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">both</span><span class="font0"> ribs, as is clearly shown&nbsp;by the'accompanying diagram&nbsp;(fig. 6). Here </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a'd</span><span class="font0"> must be&nbsp;shorter than </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ab,</span><span class="font0"> for if BAα=sc,&nbsp;then</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">αδ<sup>2</sup>=AB<sup>2</sup> + (Bδ - Aα)<sup>2 </sup>+ 2AB (Bδ - ∆α) cos </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">hence </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">ab</span><span class="font0"> will be larger the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">smaller the angle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x,</span><span class="font0"> for the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">cosine increases as the angle</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">diminishes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By a similar geometrical treatment of the question it&nbsp;may be shown that the in-tefnal intercostal muscles&nbsp;when they contract must of&nbsp;necessity depress both the ribs to which they are attached. If the&nbsp;angle BAc'=x (fig. 7), then</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">c'&lt;Z'<sup>2</sup>=AB<sup>2</sup> + (Ac'- B&lt;Z')<sup>2</sup> - 2AB(Ac<sup>,</sup>-B&lt;Z') cos </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x ; </span><span class="font0">hence </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e'd'</span><span class="font0"> will be larger the larger the angle </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">x.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The case, however, is not so clear with reference to the anterior portions of the internal intercostals which lie between the cartilages ; for it is evident that these fibres have the same direction with&nbsp;regard to the sternum as an axis as the external intercostals have&nbsp;with regard to the vertebral column as an axis ; that is to say,&nbsp;the geometrical diagram in fig. 6 applies to the intercartilaginous&nbsp;internal intercostals as perfectly as it does to the interosseous parts&nbsp;of the external intercostals, the inference being that the intercartilaginous internal intercostals tend to elevate the pair of ribs&nbsp;between which they stretch. The geometrical argument is, however, overborne by physiological experiment: Martin and Hartwell&nbsp;have observed in the dog and the cat that the internal intercostals&nbsp;throughout their whole extent contract (not synchronously) but&nbsp;alternately with the diaphragm ; hence we must conclude that&nbsp;their function throughout is not inspiratory like that of the&nbsp;diaphragm, but expiratory.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Movements of the Diaphragm.—</span><span class="font1">The muscular fibres of the diaphragm are arranged in a radial manner, or more&nbsp;strictly speaking in a manner like the lines of longitude&nbsp;on a terrestrial globe. The central tendon of the diaphragm&nbsp;corresponds to the pole of such a globe. The contraction&nbsp;of the fibres is expended on straightening the longitudinal&nbsp;curves rather than on pulling down the central tendon to a&nbsp;lower level ; in fact the central tendon moves very little in&nbsp;ordinary respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">How the Expiratory Movements are Produced.—</span><span class="font1">The action of inspiration disturbs many organs from the position of&nbsp;rest into which gravity and their own physical properties&nbsp;have thrown them. The ribs and sternum are raised from&nbsp;the position of lowest level ; the elastic costal cartilages&nbsp;are twisted ; the elastic lungs are put upon the stretch ;&nbsp;the abdominal organs, themselves elastic, are compressed&nbsp;and thrust against the elastic walls of the belly, causing&nbsp;these to bulge outwards. In short the very act of inspiration stores up, as it were, in sundry ways the forces which&nbsp;make for expiration. As soon as the inspiratory muscles&nbsp;cease to act these forces come into play, and the position&nbsp;of rest or equilibrium is regained. It is very doubtful&nbsp;whether any special expiratory muscles are called into&nbsp;action during ordinary respiration. The internal intercostals may in man be exercised in ordinary expiration (although they are certainly not so exercised in the dog and&nbsp;the cat); but in laboured expiration many muscles assist&nbsp;in the expulsive effort. The muscles forming the belly&nbsp;walls contract and force the abdominal contents against the&nbsp;relaxed diaphragm in such a manner as to drive it farther&nbsp;and farther into the thorax. At the same time by their&nbsp;attachment to the lower edge of the thorax these same&nbsp;muscles pull down the ribs and sternum. The M. triangularis sterni, which arises from the back or thoracic aspect&nbsp;of the sternum and lower costal cartilages and is inserted&nbsp;into the costal cartilages higher up, can obviously depress&nbsp;the ribs. So also can the M. serratus posticus inferior,&nbsp;which arises from the thick fascia of the loins and is inserted into the last four ribs. So also can the M. quadratus&nbsp;lumborum, which springs from the pelvis and is attached&nbsp;to the last rib. Indeed there is hardly a muscle of the&nbsp;body but may be called into play during extremely laboured&nbsp;respiration, either because it acts on the chest, or because&nbsp;it serves to steady some part and give a better purchase&nbsp;for the action of direct respiratory muscles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Certain Abnormal Forms of Respiration.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Coughing.—</span><span class="font0">There is first a deep inspiration followed by closure of the glottis. Then follows a violent expiratory effort which bursts&nbsp;open the glottis and drives the air out of thé lungs in a blast&nbsp;which carries away any light irritating matter it may meet with.&nbsp;The act is commonly involuntary, but may be imitated exactly by&nbsp;a voluntary efibrt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hawking, or Clearing the Throat.—</span><span class="font0">In this act a current of air is driven from the lungs and forced through the narrow space betλveen&nbsp;the root of the tongue and the depressed soft palate. This action&nbsp;can only be caused voluntarily.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sneezing.—</span><span class="font0">There is first an inspiration which is often unusually rapid ; then follows a sudden expiration and the blast is directed&nbsp;through the nose. The glottis remains open all the time. The act&nbsp;is generally involuntary, but may be more or less successfully&nbsp;imitated by a voluntary effort.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Snoring</span><span class="font0"> is caused by unusually steady and prolonged inspirations and expirations through the open mouth,—the soft palate and uvula&nbsp;being set vibrating by the currents of air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Crying</span><span class="font0"> consists of short deep inspirations and prolonged expirations with the glottis partially closed. Long-continued crying leads to sobbing, in which sudden spasmodic contractions of the&nbsp;diaphragm cause sudden inspirations and inspiratory sounds&nbsp;generated in larynx and pharynx.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sighing</span><span class="font0"> is a sudden and prolpnged inspiration following an unusually long pause after the last expiration.</span></p>
