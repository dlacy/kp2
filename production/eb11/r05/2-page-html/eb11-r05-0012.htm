<p><span class="font0">attempts to recapture the town, but they were unsuccessful till 1449 when Somerset, the English commander, was obliged&nbsp;to surrender the principal fortified places in Normandy. During&nbsp;the close of the 15th century and the first half of the 16th,&nbsp;Rouen was the metropolis of art and taste in France and was&nbsp;one of the first places to reflect the influence of the Renaissance.&nbsp;During the wars of religion the arts declined. In 1562 the town&nbsp;was sacked by the Protestants. This did not prevent the&nbsp;League from gaining so firm a footing there that Henry IV.&nbsp;besieged it unsuccessfully and only obtained entrance after&nbsp;his abjuration. The revocation of the edict of Nantes in 1685&nbsp;lost Rouen many of its richest and most industrious citizens in&nbsp;the Calvinistic emigration. The town suffered less from the&nbsp;excesses of the French Revolution than from the depredations&nbsp;of bandits who, under the Directory, infested the neighbourhood&nbsp;of the city and were not suppressed till the Consulate. During&nbsp;the Franco-German War the city was occupied by the invaders&nbsp;from December 1870 till July 1871, and had to submit to heavy&nbsp;requisitions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROUERGUE </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ruthenensis pagus),</span><span class="font0"> one of the old provinces of France, was originally inhabited by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rutheni.</span><span class="font0"> It was&nbsp;bounded on the N. by Auvergne, on the S. and S.W. by Languedoc, on the E. by Gévaudan and the Cévennes and on the W.&nbsp;by Quercy. It included (1) the county of Rodez, (2) Haute and&nbsp;Basse Marche; and it was divided between the dioceses of&nbsp;Rodez and Vabres (province d’Alby after this province had&nbsp;been separated from that of Bourges in 1678). Administratively it formed first a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sénéchaussée,</span><span class="font0"> dependent on Languedoc&nbsp;(capital Villefranche, in the Basse Marche), and later it was&nbsp;attached to the military governments of Guienne and Gascony.&nbsp;It was then part of the departments of Aveyron and of Tarn-et-Garonne. The county of Rodez, after having been in the&nbsp;possession of the houses of Toulouse and Carlat, fell in the 14th&nbsp;century into that of Armagnac. Jean II. of Armagnac having&nbsp;served Charles V. faithfully during his wars with England,&nbsp;received from him, in 1374, what were called the four “ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">châtellenies ”</span><span class="font0"> with the “ Commun de la paix,” a tax which had been&nbsp;established there to organize resistance against foreigners.&nbsp;Jean V. of Armagnac was deprived of the county for crime and&nbsp;treason against Louis XI., in 1469, but afterwards it was given&nbsp;back to Charles of Armagnac, who died without legitimate&nbsp;issue in 1496. Its possession was then disputed between King&nbsp;Francis I. and the duke of Alençon, who at last compromised&nbsp;(1519); the king ceded the county to his sister Marguerite&nbsp;d’Angoulême, who took it as dowry first to the duke of Alençon,&nbsp;and then to her second husband Henri d’Albret, king of Navarre.&nbsp;The county afterwards passed to Jeanne d’Albret, then to Henri&nbsp;IV., and was joined to the crown lands in 1590.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUGE (“ red,” from Lat. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rubeus),</span><span class="font0"> a French name applied to various colouring substances of a brilliant carmine tint, especially when used as cosmetics. The best of these preparations&nbsp;are such as have for their basis carthamine, obtained from&nbsp;the safflower </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Carthamus tinctorius).</span><span class="font0"> The Chinese prepare&nbsp;a rouge, said to be from safflower, which, spread on the cards&nbsp;on which it is sold, has a brilliant metallic green lustre, but&nbsp;when moistened and applied to the skin assumes a delicate&nbsp;carmine tint. Jeweller’s rouge for polishing plate is a fine red&nbsp;iron oxide prepared by calcination from ferrous sulphate (green&nbsp;vitriol).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUGET DE LISLE, CLAUDE JOSEPH (1760-1836), French author, was born on the 10th of May 1760, at Lons-le-Saunier&nbsp;(Jura). He entered the army as an engineer, and attained&nbsp;the rank of captain. He was one of those authors whom a&nbsp;single work has made famous. The song which has immortalized him, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise,</span><span class="font0"> was composed at Strassburg,&nbsp;where Rouget de Lisle was quartered in April 1792. He wrote&nbsp;both words and music in a fit of patriotic excitement after a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">public dinner. The piece was at first called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ckanl de guerre de Varmée du Rhin,</span><span class="font0"> and only received its name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">from its adoption by the Provençal volunteers whom Barbaroux&nbsp;introduced into Paris, and who were prominent in the storming&nbsp;of the Tuileries. The author was a moderate republican, and&nbsp;was cashiered and thrown into prison; but the counter-revolution set him at liberty. He died at Choisy-le-Roi (Seine et&nbsp;Oise) on the 26th of June 1836. The stirring melody of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise</span><span class="font0"> and its ingenious adaptation to the words serve to&nbsp;disguise the alternate poverty and bombast of the words themselves. Rouget de Lisle wrote a few other songs of the same&nbsp;kind, and in 1825 he published </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chants français,</span><span class="font0"> in which he set&nbsp;to music fifty songs by various authors. His </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Essais en vers&nbsp;et en prose</span><span class="font0"> (1797) contains the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Marseillaise,</span><span class="font0"> a prose tale of&nbsp;the sentimental kind called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide et Monville,</span><span class="font0"> and some&nbsp;occasional poems.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUGH CAST (the French equivalent is </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">crépis),</span><span class="font0"> in architecture, the exterior coating originally given to the walls of common dwellings and outbuildings, but now frequently employed for&nbsp;decorative effect on country houses, especially those built in&nbsp;half timber. It is a composition of small gravel and sand,&nbsp;mixed with strong lime mortar, and is thrown on the walls&nbsp;already covered with two ordinary coats of plaster. Variety&nbsp;can be obtained on the surface of the wall by small pebbles&nbsp;of different colours, and in the Tudor period fragments of glass&nbsp;were sometimes embedded. The central tower of St Alban’s&nbsp;cathedral, built with Roman tiles from Verulam, was covered&nbsp;with rough cast believed to be coeval with the building. The&nbsp;rough cast was removed about 1870.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROUHER, EUGÈNE (1814-1884), French statesman, was born at Riom (Puy de Dôme) on the 30th of November 1814.&nbsp;He practised law in his native place after taking his degree&nbsp;in Paris in 1835, and in 1846 sought election by his fellow-citizens to the Chamber of Deputies as an official candidate&nbsp;of the Guizot ministry. It was only after the revolution of&nbsp;1848, however, that he became deputy for the department&nbsp;of Puy de Dôme. Re-elected to the Legislative Chamber in&nbsp;1849 he succeeded Odilon Barrot as minister of justice, with&nbsp;the additional office of keeper of the seals, which he retained&nbsp;with short intervals until January 1852. From the tribune&nbsp;of the Chamber he described the revolution of February as a&nbsp;“ catastrophe,” and he supported reactionary legislation, notably&nbsp;the bill (May 31, 1850) for the limitation of the suffrage. After&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coup d’état</span><span class="font0"> of December 2, 1851, he was entrusted with the&nbsp;redaction of the new constitution, and on his resignation of&nbsp;office in January became vice-president of the Council of State.&nbsp;After the formal establishment of the Empire, Napoleon III.&nbsp;rewarded him by a grant of £40,000 and the estate of Cirey.&nbsp;In 1855 he became minister of agriculture, commerce and public&nbsp;works, and in 1856 senator. He secured for France an excellent&nbsp;system of railways without making them a state monopoly,&nbsp;and he conducted the complicated negotiations for the treaty&nbsp;of commerce with England which was concluded in January&nbsp;i860, and subsequently arranged similar treaties with Belgium&nbsp;and Italy. In 1863 he became minister president of the Council&nbsp;of State, and on the death of A. A. M. Billault minister of state&nbsp;and chief spokesman of the emperor before the Corps Législatif.&nbsp;Although the government had a great majority in the Chamber,&nbsp;the opposition counted the redoubtable names of Thiers,&nbsp;Berryer and Jules Favre, and government measures were only&nbsp;passed by frequent resort to the closure. Rouher had to&nbsp;defend Napoleon’s foreign adventures as well as the free-trade treaties and the extravagances of Baron Haussmann for&nbsp;which he was directly responsible. After an attempted defence&nbsp;of the foreign policy which had aided the aggrandizement of&nbsp;Prussia at the expense of Austria, Thiers told him in the Chamber&nbsp;that there were “ no more blunders left for him to make.” He&nbsp;opposed the abortive Liberal concessions of January 1867,&nbsp;announced in a personal letter from Napoleon III. to himself,&nbsp;and resigned with the rest of the cabinet, only to resume office&nbsp;after a short interval as minister of finance. When concessions&nbsp;became inevitable Rouher, the “ vice-empereur,” resigned</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
