<p><span class="font1">few and viewed as worthless by most Jews themselves, while the others are either works necessary to the Jewish&nbsp;worship, which was licensed by papal as well as imperial&nbsp;law, or contain matter of value and scholarly interest&nbsp;which ought not to be sacrificed because they are connected with another faith than that of the Christians.&nbsp;Instead of destroying a whole literature, which was what&nbsp;Pfefferkorn proposed, he proposed that the emperor should&nbsp;decree that for ten years there be two Hebrew chairs&nbsp;at every German university for which the Jews should&nbsp;furnish books. The other experts and all the universities&nbsp;consulted, except Heidelberg, proposed that all books&nbsp;except Bibles should be taken from the Jews to be investigated by a commission ; and, as the emperor still hesitated,&nbsp;the bigots threw on Reuchlin the whole blame of their&nbsp;ill success. Pfefferkorn circulated at the Frankfort fair&nbsp;of 1511 a gross libel (the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Handspiegek)</span><span class="font1"> declaring that&nbsp;Reuchlin had been bribed ; and Reuchlin, burning with&nbsp;the indigation of a man of unsullied integrity, retorted as&nbsp;warmly in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Augenspiegel</span><span class="font1"> (1511). His adversary’s next&nbsp;move was to declare the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Augenspiegel</span><span class="font1"> a dangerous book ;&nbsp;the Cologne faculty, with their dean the grand inquisitor&nbsp;Hochstraten, took up this cry, and, encouraged perhaps by&nbsp;some signs of timidity in letters from Reuchlin to two of&nbsp;the Cologne theologians, they called on him to recant not&nbsp;a few dangerous utterances and misapplications of Scripture.&nbsp;Reuchlin was timid, but he was honesty itself. He was&nbsp;willing to receive corrections in theology, which was not&nbsp;his subject, but he could not unsay what he had said ; and&nbsp;as his enemies tried to press him into a corner he at&nbsp;length turned and met them with open defiance in a&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Defeηsio contra Calumniatores,</span><span class="font1"> 1513. The universities&nbsp;were now appealed to for opinions, and were all against&nbsp;Reuchlin. Even Paris (August 1514) condemned the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Augenspiegel,</span><span class="font1"> and called on Reuchlin to recant. Meantime&nbsp;a formal process had begun at Mainz before the grand&nbsp;inquisitor, but Reuchlin by an appeal succeeded in transferring the question to Rome. It is needless to follow&nbsp;the long windings of ecclesiastical process ; judgment&nbsp;was not finally given till July 1516 ; and then, though the&nbsp;decision was really for Reuchlin, the trial was simply&nbsp;quashed. The result had cost Reuchlin years of trouble&nbsp;and no small part of his modest fortune, but it was worth&nbsp;the sacrifice. For far above the direct importance of the&nbsp;issue was the great stirring of public opinion which had&nbsp;gone forward. All who loved learning and progress were&nbsp;banded together as they had never been before against&nbsp;the bigots and the stupid universities ; and all humanists&nbsp;felt that the victory was theirs. And if the obscurantists&nbsp;escaped easily at Rome, λvith only a half condemnation,&nbsp;they received a crushing blow in Germany. No party&nbsp;could survive the ridicule that was poured on them in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum.</span><span class="font1"> Reuchlin did not long enjoy&nbsp;his victory in peace. In 1519 Stuttgart was visited by&nbsp;famine, civil war, and pestilence. Frbm November of this&nbsp;year to the spring of 1521 the veteran statesman, whom the&nbsp;universal respect felt for his scholarship could not secure&nbsp;against the dangers involved in his political relations,&nbsp;sought refuge in Ingolstadt and taught there for a, year&nbsp;as professor of Greek and Hebrew. It was forty-one&nbsp;years since at Poitiers he had last spoken from a public&nbsp;chair; but the old man of sixty-five had not lost his gift&nbsp;of teaching, and hundreds of scholars crowded round him.&nbsp;This gleam of autumn sunshine was again broken by the&nbsp;plague ; but now he was called to Tübingen and again&nbsp;spent the winter of 1521-22 teaching in his own systematic solid way. But he was now in shaken health ; in the&nbsp;spring he found it necessary to visit the baths of Liebenzell,&nbsp;and here he was seized with jaundice, of which he died&nbsp;30th June 1522, leaving in the history of the new learning&nbsp;a name only second to that of his younger contemporary&nbsp;Erasmus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The authorities for Reuchlin’s life are enumerated in L. Geiger, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Johann Reuchlin,</span><span class="font0"> 1871, which is the standard biography.

<p><span class="font1">RÉUNION, formerly Bourbon, an island in the Indian Ocean, belonging to France and considered one of her&nbsp;more important colonies. St Denis, the capital, stands on&nbsp;the north side in 20° 51' S. lat. and 53° 9' E. long. Physically it may be described as the southmost subaerial summit&nbsp;of the great submarine ridge which, running north-east&nbsp;by Mauritius, Albatross Island, Jιc., and curving round&nbsp;by the Seychelles, connects with the platform of Madagascar at its north-eastern extremity. The great submarine&nbsp;valley which is thus enclosed between Madagascar and the&nbsp;Mascarene-Seychelles ridge has a depth of from 2000 to&nbsp;2400 fathoms. In a straight line Réunion lies 115 miles&nbsp;from the east coast of Madagascar ; and Mauritius, with&nbsp;which it communicates by optic signalling since 1882, is&nbsp;115 miles to the north-east. The island has an area of&nbsp;721,314 acres or 1127 square miles. It is usual to regard&nbsp;it as divided into a windward and a leeward district by&nbsp;a line, practically the watershed, running in the direction&nbsp;of the greater axis. The whole island is the result of a&nbsp;double volcanic action. First there arose from the sea&nbsp;a mountain whose summit is approximately represented&nbsp;by Piton des Neiges (10,069 feet), and at a later date&nbsp;another crater opened towards the east, which, piling up&nbsp;the mountain mass of Le Volcan, turned what was till then&nbsp;a circle into an ellipse 44 miles by 31. In the older&nbsp;upheaval the most striking features are now three areas of&nbsp;subsidence—the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cirques</span><span class="font1"> of Salazie, Rivière des Galets, and&nbsp;Cilaos—which lie north-west and south of the Piton des&nbsp;Neiges and form the gathering grounds respectively of the&nbsp;Rivière du Mât, the Rivière des Galets, and the Rivière de&nbsp;St Étienne. The first, which may be taken as typical, is&nbsp;surrounded by high almost perpendicular walls of basaltic&nbsp;lava, and its surface is rendered irregular by hills and&nbsp;hillocks of debris fallen from the heights. Towards the south&nbsp;lies the vast stratum of rocks (150 to 200 feet deep) which,&nbsp;on the 26th November 1875, suddenly sweeping down from&nbsp;the Piton des Neiges and the Gros Morne, buried the little&nbsp;village of Grand Sable and nearly a hundred of its inhabitants. A considerable piece of ground, with its trees,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
