<p><span class="font1">road constructed and worked by a Russian company and opened to traffic in 1899 connects Resht with Teheran via&nbsp;Kazvin.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;r</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The value of trade probably exceeds £2,000,000, principal exports being rice, raw silk, dry fruit, fish, sheep and cattle,&nbsp;wool and cotton, and cocoons, the principal imports sugar,&nbsp;cotton goods, silkworm “ seed ” or eggs (£70,160 worth in&nbsp;1906-7), petroleum, glass and china. The trade in dried silkworm cocoons has increased remarkably since 1893, when only&nbsp;76,150 Ib valued at £6475 were exported; during the year&nbsp;1906-7 ending 20th March, 2,717,540 ft) valued at £238,000 were&nbsp;exported. There are telegraph and post offices and branches of&nbsp;the Imperial Bank of Persia and Banque d’Escompte.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RESIDENCE (Latin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">residere,</span><span class="font1"> to remain behind, to dwell, reside), in general, a place of abode. In law, it usually means&nbsp;continuance in a place. The ordinary meaning of the word has&nbsp;been defined as “ the place where an individual eats, drinks and&nbsp;sleeps, or where his family or his servants eat, drink and sleep ”&nbsp;(R. v. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">North Curry,</span><span class="font1"> 1825, 4 B. &amp; C. 959). For certain purposes,&nbsp;however, a man may be said to have his residence not only&nbsp;where he sleeps, but also at his place of business. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Abode ;&nbsp;Domicile.</span><span class="font1"> In ecclesiastical law residence is the continuance&nbsp;of a spiritual person upon his benefice. As a general rule, it is&nbsp;necessary for every rector or vicar to reside within his parish,&nbsp;even though there may be no house of residence annexed to the&nbsp;benefice. But under certain circumstances the bishop of the&nbsp;diocese may grant a licence of non-residence (Pluralities Act&nbsp;1836).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESIDENT, a political agent or officer representing the Indian government in certain native states in India. He resides&nbsp;in the state and advises on all matters of government, legislative&nbsp;or executive. Residents are divided into three classes or ranks.&nbsp;In certain other dependencies or protectorates of the British&nbsp;Empire the representative of the government is termed a resident&nbsp;or political agent, notably in Nepaul, Aden, Sarawak, British&nbsp;North Borneo, &amp;c. In general, where the state to which a&nbsp;resident is attached is not an independent one, he exercises&nbsp;consular and magisterial functions.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">■ RESIDUE (through the French, from thc Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">residuum,</span><span class="font1"> a remainder, from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">residere,</span><span class="font1"> to remain), in law, that which remains&nbsp;of a testator’s estate after all debts and legacies are discharged,&nbsp;and funeral, administration and other expenses paid. The&nbsp;•person to whom this residue or surplus is left is termed the&nbsp;residuary legatee; should none be mentioned in the will the&nbsp;residue goes to the next of kin (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Executors and Administrators ; Legacy; Will) .</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESIN (through O.Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">resine,</span><span class="font1"> modern </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">résine,</span><span class="font1"> from Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">resina,</span><span class="font1"> probably Latinized from Greek </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ρητίνη,</span><span class="font1"> resin), a secretion&nbsp;formed in special resin canals or passages of plants, from many&nbsp;of which, such as, for example, coniferous trees, it exudes in&nbsp;soft tears, hardening into solid masses in the air. Otherwise it&nbsp;may be obtained by making incisions in the bark or wood of&nbsp;the secreting plant. It can also be extracted from almost all&nbsp;plants by treatment of the tissue with alcohol. Certain resins&nbsp;are obtained in a fossilized condition, amber being the most&nbsp;notable instance of this class; African copal and the kauri&nbsp;gum of New Zealand are also procured in a semi-fossil condition. The resins which are obtained as natural exudations&nbsp;are in general mixtures of different, peculiar acids, named the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">resin acids,</span><span class="font1"> which dissolve in alkalis to form resin soaps, from&nbsp;which the resin acids are regenerated by treatment with acids.&nbsp;They are closely related to the terpenes, with which they occur&nbsp;in plants and of which they are oxidation products. Examples&nbsp;of resin acids are abietic (sylvic) acid, Ci<sub>9</sub>H<sub>28</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, occurring in&nbsp;colophony, and pimaric acid, C<sub>2</sub>OH<sub>jo</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a constituent of gallipo&nbsp;resin. Abietic acid can be extracted from colophony by means&nbsp;of hot alcohol; it crystallizes in leaflets, and on oxidation&nbsp;yields trimellitic, isophthalic and terebic acid. Pimaric acid&nbsp;closely resembles abietic acid into which it passes when distilled in a vacuum; it has been supposed to consist of three&nbsp;isomers. Resins when soft are known as oleo-resins, and when&nbsp;containing benzoic or cinnamic acid they are called balsams.&nbsp;Other resinous products are in their natural condition mixed&nbsp;with gum or mucilaginous substances and known as gum-resins.&nbsp;The general conception of a resin is a noncrystalline body,&nbsp;insoluble in water, mostly soluble in alcohol, essential oils, ether&nbsp;and hot fatty oils, softening and melting under the influence of&nbsp;heat, not capable of sublimation, and burning with a bright but&nbsp;smoky flame. A typical resin is a transparent or translucent&nbsp;mass, with a vitreous fracture and a faintly yellow or brown&nbsp;colour, inodorous or having only a slight turpentine odour and&nbsp;taste. Many compound resins, however, from their admixture&nbsp;with essential oils, are possessed of distinct and characteristic&nbsp;odours. The hard transparent resins, such as the copals,&nbsp;dammars, mastic and sandarach, are principally used for&nbsp;varnishes and cement, while the softer odoriferous oleo-resins&nbsp;(frankincense, turpentine, copaiba) and gum-resins containing essential oils (ammoniacum, asafoetida, gamboge, myrrh,&nbsp;scammony) are more largely used for therapeutic purposes and&nbsp;incense. Amber </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> is a fossil resin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESOLUTION, a word used in the two main senses, separation and decision, of the verb “ to resolve ” (Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tesolvere,</span><span class="font1"> to loose, unfasten), to separate anything into its constituent&nbsp;elements or component parts, hence, through the subsidiary&nbsp;meaning of to clear up doubts or difficulties, to settle, determine.&nbsp;Theprincipalapplications of the term in its first sense are to the&nbsp;separation of a body into its component parts by chemical&nbsp;process, or, to the eye, by the lens of a microscope or telescope;&nbsp;similarly, in mathematics, to the analysis of a velocity, force,&nbsp;&amp;c., into components. In the second sense, beyond the general&nbsp;meaning of determination, firmness of character, a “ resolution ”&nbsp;is specifically a decision of opinion formally submitted to a&nbsp;legislative or other assembly and adopted or rejected by votes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RESORCIN (meta-dioxy benzene), CeIL(OH)<sub>2</sub>, one of the dihydric phenols. It is obtained on fusing many, resins&nbsp;(galbanum, asafoetida, &amp;c.) with caustic potash, or by the&nbsp;distillation of Brazil-wood extract. It may be prepared&nbsp;synthetically by fusing meta-iodophenol, phenol meta-sulphonic&nbsp;acid, and benzene meta-disulphonic acid with potash; by the&nbsp;action of nitrous acid on meta-aminophenol; or by the action&nbsp;of 10% hydrochloric acid on meta-phenylene diamine (J. Meyer,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ber.,</span><span class="font1"> 1897, 30, p. 2569). Many ortho and para-compounds of&nbsp;the aromatic series (for example, the brom-phenols, benzene&nbsp;para-disulphonic acid) also yield resorcin on fusion with caustic&nbsp;potash. It crystallizes from benzene in colourless needles which&nbsp;melt at 119° C. and boil at 276-5° C. (L. Calderon), or 280° C.&nbsp;(C. Graebe), and is readily soluble in water, alcohol and ether,&nbsp;but insoluble in chloroform and carbon bisulphide. It reduces&nbsp;Fehling’s solution, and ammoniacal silver solutions. It does&nbsp;not form a precipitate with lead acetate solution, as the isomeric&nbsp;pyrocatechin does. Ferric chloride colours its aqueous solution&nbsp;a dark violet, and bromine water precipitates tribromresorcin.&nbsp;Sodium amalgam reduces it to dihydroresorcin, which when&nbsp;heated to 150-160° C. with concentrated baryta solution gives&nbsp;7-acetylbutyric acid (D. Vorländer); when fused with caustic&nbsp;potash, resorcin yields phloroglucin, pyrocatechin and diresorcin.&nbsp;It condenses with acids or acid chlorides, in the presence of&nbsp;dehydrating agents, to oxyketones, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font1"> with zinc chloride and&nbsp;glacial acetic acid at 145° C. it yields resacetophenone&nbsp;(HO)<sub>2</sub>C<sub>e</sub>H<sub>3</sub>-CO-CH<sub>3</sub> (M. Nencki and N. Sieber, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Jour. prak. Chem.,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">1881 [2], 23, </span><span class="font0">p. </span><span class="font1">147). With the anhydrides of dibasic acids&nbsp;it yields fluoresceins </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span><span class="font1"> When heated with calcium chloride-ammonia to 200° C. it yields meta-dioxydiphenylamine (A.&nbsp;Seyewitz, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bull. Soc. Chirn.,</span><span class="font1"> 1890 [3], 3, p. 811). With sodium&nbsp;nitrite it forms a water-soluble blue dye, which is turned red by&nbsp;acids, and is used as an indicator, under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Iacmoid</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
