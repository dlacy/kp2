 a celebrated physician in the reigns of the Emperors Severus and Caracalla, about the year 200. He wrote several treatises on history and the works of nature ; but there is only one of them extant, which is a very indifferent poem on the Remedies of Diseases. He was murdered at a festival by the order of Caracalla. He had a library that contained sixty-two thousand volumes, which Quintus Serenus Sammonicus, his son, gave to Gordian the younger, to whom he was preceptor.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
