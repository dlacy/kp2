<p><span class="font2">which the air-way has become blocked by a child having sucked hot water from the spout of a kettle or teapot, or in the case&nbsp;of obstruction by the swelling of the acute inflammation of&nbsp;laryngitis or of diphtheria. Should the air-way through the&nbsp;larynx become narrowed by the presence of a growth which&nbsp;does not diminish under the influence of iodide of potassium, the&nbsp;question may arise as to whether it should be dealt with by&nbsp;Sphtting the thyroid cartilage and holding the wings apart, or&nbsp;by the removal of the whole larynx. For such growths are often&nbsp;malignant. If the wide infection of the lymphatic glands of&nbsp;the neck suggests that no radical operation should be undertaken,&nbsp;a bent silver tube may be introduced below the growth (tracheotomy) in order to provide for the entrance of air. This will get&nbsp;over the difficulty of breathing, but it cannot, of course, do more&nbsp;than that.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">A cute laryngitis</span><span class="font2"> is very often due to diphtheria. The symptoms are those of laryngeal obstruction, together with constitutional&nbsp;disturbances of various kinds. The old-fashioned nurse called&nbsp;the disease “ croup ”—a term devoid of scientific meaning (see&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Diphtheria).</span><span class="font2"> In an ordinary catarrhal case, leeches and&nbsp;fomentations may suffice, though sometimes tracheotomy or&nbsp;intubation is called for. But if bacteriological examination&nbsp;shows the presence of diphtheritic bacilli, antitoxin must at&nbsp;once be injected. (See also </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lung.)</span><span class="font2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(E. O.*)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RESPITE (O. Fr. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">respit,</span><span class="font2"> modern </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">repit,</span><span class="font2"> Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">respectus,</span><span class="font2"> regard, consideration, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">respicere,</span><span class="font2"> to look back at), properly a delay, given&nbsp;for the further consideration of some matter, hence relief. In&nbsp;law the term is used of the postponement of the immediate&nbsp;execution of the law in criminal cases, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> by binding a convicted prisoner over to come up for judgment when called upon,&nbsp;or when a case is “respited” from one quarter sessions to&nbsp;another. The word is loosely used in the sense of a “ reprieve ”&nbsp;(?.?.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RESPOND, in architecture, the term given to the half-pier or semi-detached column at the end of a range of piers or columns&nbsp;carrying an architrave or arcade. In Greek temples the respond&nbsp;is known as the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">anta.</span><span class="font2"> Thc term is also given to the wall pilaster&nbsp;which in Roman and Renaissance work is frequently placed&nbsp;behind the detached columns forming the decoration of a&nbsp;wall.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">- RESPONDENT (from Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">respondere,</span><span class="font2"> to answer), strictly, one who answers; in law one called upon to answer a petition&nbsp;or other proceeding. In a matrimonial cause the defendant in&nbsp;the suit is called the respondent. The defendant to a quarter&nbsp;sessions appeal is called the respondent, and so generally in&nbsp;appeals is the party, whether plaintiff or defendant, against&nbsp;whom the appeal is brought.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">REST (O. Eng. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rcest, reste,</span><span class="font2"> bed, cognate with other Teutonic forms, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> Ger. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rast, Rüste,</span><span class="font2"> rest, and probably Gothic </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rasta,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">league, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font2"> resting or stopping place), a cessation from active&nbsp;or regular work, hence a time of relief from mental or manual&nbsp;labour. Specific meanings are for an interval of silence in music,&nbsp;marked by a sign indicating the length of the pause; for the&nbsp;forked support with iron-shod spike carried by the soldier till&nbsp;the end of the 17th century as a rest for the heavy musket;&nbsp;and for the support for the cue in billiards to be used when the&nbsp;striking ball is out of reach of the natural rest formed by the&nbsp;hand. In the medieval armour of the horsed man-at-arms, and&nbsp;later in the armour of the tournament, a contrivance was fixed to&nbsp;the side of the body-armour near the right arm-pit, in which the&nbsp;butt-end of the lance was placed to prevent the lance being driven&nbsp;back after striking the opponent at full charge; hence a knight,&nbsp;as a preliminary to the charge, “ laid his lance in rest.” This&nbsp;“ rest” is a shortened form of “ arrest,” to check, stop, as is&nbsp;seen by the French equivalent, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">arrêt.</span><span class="font2"> Further, “ rest,” that&nbsp;which remains over and above, is derived from the* French&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">rester,</span><span class="font2"> to remain over, Lat. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">restare,</span><span class="font2"> to remain, literally, to stay&nbsp;behind. The principal specific use of this word is in commerce for the balance of undivided profit; it has thus always&nbsp;been the term used by the Bank of England for that which in&nbsp;other banks and companies is called the “ reserve ” (Hartley&nbsp;Withers, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Meaning of Money</span><span class="font2"> (1909), p. 298). The Bank of</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">England “ rest ” is never allowed to fall below £3,000,000 (see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Banks and Banking).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RESTIF, NICOLAS EDME (1734-1806), called </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Restif de la Bretonne,</span><span class="font2"> French novelist, son of a farmer, was born at Sacy&nbsp;(Yonne) on the 23rd of October 1734. He was educated by the&nbsp;Jansenists at Bicêtre, and on the expulsion of the Jansenists&nbsp;was received by one of his brothers, who was a curé. Owing to&nbsp;a scandal in which he was involved, he was apprenticed to a printer&nbsp;at Auxerre, and, having served his time, went to Paris. Here he&nbsp;worked as a journeyman printer, and in 1760 he married Anne or&nbsp;Agnes Lebêgue, a relation of his former master at Auxerre. It&nbsp;was not until five or six years after his marriage that Restif&nbsp;appeared as an author, and from that time to his death, on the&nbsp;2nd of February 1806, he produced a bewildering multitude of&nbsp;books, amounting to something like two hundred volumes, many&nbsp;of them printed with his own hand, on almost every conceivable&nbsp;variety of subject. Restif suffered at one time or another the&nbsp;extremes of poverty and was acquainted with every kind of&nbsp;intrigue. He drew on the episodes of his own life for his books,&nbsp;which, in spite of their faded sentiment, contain truthful pictures&nbsp;of French society on the eve of the Revolution. The most&nbsp;noteworthy of his works are </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Pied de Panchetle,</span><span class="font2"> a novel (1769);&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Pornographe</span><span class="font2"> (1769), a plan for regulating prostitution which is&nbsp;said to have been actually carried out by the Emperor Joseph II.,&nbsp;while not a few detached hints have been adopted by continental&nbsp;nations; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Paysan perverti</span><span class="font2"> (1775), a novel with a moral purpose,&nbsp;though sufficiently horrible in detail; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Vie de mon père</span><span class="font2"> (1779);&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Les Contemporaines</span><span class="font2"> (42 vols., 1780-1785), a vast collection of short&nbsp;stories; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ingénue Saxancour,</span><span class="font2"> also a novel (1785); and, lastly,&nbsp;the extraordinary autobiography of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Monsieur Nicolas</span><span class="font2"> (16 vols.,&nbsp;1794-1797; the last two are practically a separate and much less&nbsp;interesting work), in which at the age of sixty he has set down&nbsp;his remembrances, his notions on ethical and social points, his&nbsp;hatreds, and above all his numerous loves, real and fancied. The&nbsp;original editions of these, and indeed of all his books, have long&nbsp;been bibliographical curiosities owing to their rarity, the beautiful&nbsp;and curious illustrations which many of them contain, and the&nbsp;quaint typographic system in which most are composed. In&nbsp;1795 he received a gratuity of 2000 francs from the government,&nbsp;and just before his death Napoleon gave him a place in the&nbsp;ministry of police, which he did not live to take up.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Restif de la Bretonne undoubtedly holds a remarkable place in French literature. He was inordinately vain, of extremely relaxed&nbsp;morals, and perhaps not entirely sane. His books were written&nbsp;with haste, and their licence of subject and language renders them&nbsp;quite unfit for general perusal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The works.of C. Monselet, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Retif de la Bretonne</span><span class="font1"> (1853), and P. Lacroix, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Bibliographie et iconographie</span><span class="font1"> (1875), J. Assézat’s selection&nbsp;from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Contemporaines,</span><span class="font1"> with excellent introductions (3 vols., 1875),&nbsp;and the valuable reprint of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Monsieur Nicolas</span><span class="font1"> (14 vols., 1883-1884),&nbsp;will .be sufficient to enable even curious readers to form a judgment&nbsp;of him. His life, written by his contemporary Cubières-Palmezeaux,&nbsp;was republished in 1875.

<p><span class="font2">RESTOUT, JEAN (1692-1768), French painter, born at Rouen on the 26th of March 1692, was the son of Jean Restout,&nbsp;the first of that name, and of Marie M. Jouvenet, sister and pupil&nbsp;of the well-known Jean Jouvenet. In 1717, the Royal Academy&nbsp;having elected him a member on his work for the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grand Prix,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">he remained in Paris, instead of proceeding to Italy, exhibited at&nbsp;all the salons, and filled successively every post of academical&nbsp;distinction. He died on the ist of January 1768. His works,&nbsp;chiefly altar-pieces (Louvre Museum), ceilings and designs for&nbsp;Gobelin tapestries, were engraved by Cochin, Drevet and&nbsp;others; his diploma picture may still be seen at St Cloud.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">His son, </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Jean Bernard Restout</span><span class="font2"> (1732-1797), won the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Grand Prix</span><span class="font2"> in 1758, and on his return from Italy was received into the&nbsp;Academy; but his refusal to comply with rules led to a quarrel&nbsp;with that body. Roland appointed him keeper of the Garde&nbsp;Meuble, but this piece of favour nearly cost him his life during&nbsp;the Terror. The St Bruno painted by him at Rome is in the&nbsp;Louvre.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
