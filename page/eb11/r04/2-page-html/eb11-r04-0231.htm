<p><span class="font2">The most comprehensive view of Rosmini’s philosophical standpoint is to be found in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sistema filosofeo,</span><span class="font2"> in which he set forth the conception of a complete encyclopaedia of the human knowable,&nbsp;synthetically conjoined, according to the order of ideas, in a perfectly&nbsp;harmonious whole. Contemplating the position of recent philosophy&nbsp;from Locke to Hegel, and having his eye directed to the ancient&nbsp;and fundamental problem of the origin, truth and certainty of our&nbsp;ideas, he wrote: “If philosophy is to be restored to love and&nbsp;respect, I think it will be necessary, in part, to return to the teachings&nbsp;of the ancients, and in part to give those teachings the benefit of&nbsp;modern methods ’’ </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Theodicy,</span><span class="font2"> n. ia.8). He examined and analysed&nbsp;the fact of human knowledge, and obtained the following results:&nbsp;(i) that the notion or idea of being or existence in general enters&nbsp;into, and is presupposed by, all our acquired cognitions, so that,&nbsp;without it, they would be impossible ; (2) that this idea is essentially&nbsp;objective, inasmuch as what is seen in it is as distinct from and opposed&nbsp;to the mind.that secs it as the light is from the eye that looks at it ;&nbsp;(3) that it is essentially true, because “ being ’* and “ truth ’’ are&nbsp;convertible terms, and because in the vision of it the mind cannot&nbsp;err, since error could only be committed by a judgment, and here&nbsp;there is no judgment, but a pure intuition affirming.nothing and&nbsp;denying nothing; (^) that by the application of this essentially&nbsp;objective and true idea the human being intellectually perceives,&nbsp;first, the animal body individually conjoined with him, «and then,&nbsp;on occasion of the sensations producecf in him. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not by himself,</span><span class="font2"> the&nbsp;causes of those sensations, that is, from the action felt he perceives&nbsp;and affirms an agent, a being, and therefore a true thing, that&nbsp;acts on him, and he thus gets at the external world,—these are the&nbsp;true primitive judgments, containing (a) the subsistence of the&nbsp;particular being (subject), and (6) its essence or species as determined by the quality of the action felt from it (predicate) ; (5) that&nbsp;reflection, by separating the essence or species from the subsistence,&nbsp;obtains the full specific idea (universalization), and then from this,&nbsp;by leaving aside some of its elements, the abstract specific idea&nbsp;(abstraction); (6) that the mind, having reached this stage, of&nbsp;development, can proceed to further and further abstracts, including&nbsp;the first principles of reasoning, the principles of the several sciences,&nbsp;complex ideas, groups of ideas, ana so on without end; (7) finally,&nbsp;that the same most universal idea of being, this generator and formal&nbsp;element of all acquired cognitions, cannot itself be acquired, but&nbsp;must be innate in us, implanted by God in our nature. Being, as&nbsp;naturally shining to our mind, must therefore be what men call the&nbsp;light of reason. Hence the name Rosmini gives it of ideal being;&nbsp;and this he laid down as the fundamental principle of all philosophy*&nbsp;and the supreme criterion of truth and certainty. This he believed&nbsp;to be the teaching of St Augustine, as well as of St Thomas, of whom&nbsp;he was an ardent admirer and defender.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">ROSNY, JOSEPH HENRY, a pseudonym covering the collaboration of the French novelists, Joseph Henri Honoré Boëx, born at Brussels in 1856, and his brother Séraphin Justin&nbsp;François Boëx, born at Brussels in 1859. The novels of J. H.&nbsp;Rosny are full of scientific knowledge, of astronomy, anthropology, zoology and, above all, sociology. The stories are&nbsp;approached from the point of view of society rather than of the&nbsp;individual, but the characters, strongly individualized and&nbsp;intensely real, are only incidentally typical. The elder Rosny&nbsp;was the sole author of the earlier novels, and began novelwriting as an avowed disciple of Zola. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Nell Horn, membre de&nbsp;l'armée du salut</span><span class="font2"> (1885) is a picture of London life and social&nbsp;reform; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Bilatéral</span><span class="font2"> (1886) and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Marc Fane</span><span class="font2"> (1888) describe the&nbsp;revolutionary and anarchist parties of Paris; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">L'Immolation</span><span class="font2"> (1887)&nbsp;is a brutal story of peasant life; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Le Termite</span><span class="font2"> (1890) is a picture of&nbsp;literary life in Paris; and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">V amir eh</span><span class="font2"> (1891), with </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Erymah</span><span class="font2"> (1895),&nbsp;and </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Les Profondeurs de Kyamo</span><span class="font2"> (short stories, 1896) and others&nbsp;deal with prehistoric man.

<p><span class="font2">ROSS, ALEXANDER (1699-1784), Scottish poet, was born on the 13th of April 1699 at Kincardine-0’Neil, Aberdeenshire.&nbsp;He was educated at Marischal College, Aberdeen, and became&nbsp;tutor to the children of Sir William Forbes of Craigievar. He&nbsp;became in 1732 schoolmaster of Lochlee, Angus, where the rest&nbsp;of his life was spent. He had long been in the habit of writing&nbsp;verse for his own amusement, when in 1768 he published, at the&nbsp;suggestion of James Beattie, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Fortunate Shepherdess . . .&nbsp;to which is (sic) added a few songs.</span><span class="font2"> This is a pastoral narrativë&nbsp;poem, written in obvious imitation of Allan Ramsay’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Gentle&nbsp;Shepherd.</span><span class="font2"> Its affectations are chiefly on the surface. The&nbsp;background of shepherd life as known to Ross, and the rather&nbsp;sordid motives of the characters, despite their high-sounding&nbsp;names of Helenore, Rosalind, &amp;c., are depicted with uncompromising truth. He died at Lochlee, and was buried on the&nbsp;26th of May 1784.</span></p>

Walker, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Three Centuries of Scottish Literature </span><span class="font2">(1893), ii. 28-34. The bulk of Ross’s writings remain in MS.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">ROSS, GEORGE WILLIAM </span><span class="font2">(1841- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;), Canadian politician,</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">was born near Nairn, Middlesex county, Ontario, on the 18th of September 1841, the son of James Ross and Ellen M‘Kinnon,&nbsp;natives of Ross-shire, Scotland. From 1872-1883 he was a&nbsp;Liberal member of the Federal House; from 1883-99&nbsp;minister of education in the legislature of the province of&nbsp;Ontario; and from 1899-1905. premier and treasurer of that&nbsp;province. In 1905 his government was defeated, and in 1907&nbsp;he retired to the Canadian Senate. He was for many years&nbsp;an advocate of total abstinence, and a well-known speaker on&nbsp;imperial questions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ROSS, SIR HEW' DALRYMPLE (1779-1868), British soldier, entered the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, in 1793, and&nbsp;passed out into the Royal Artillery two years later. With&nbsp;the Royal Horse Artillery he saw active service during the&nbsp;Irish rebellion of 1798, and after eleven years’ service was promoted captain and appointed to command “ A ” troop R.H.A.&nbsp;(afterwards famous as the <sup>u</sup> Chestnut Troop ”). In 1809 the&nbsp;troop landed at Lisbon and at once set out to join Wellington’s&nbsp;army, reaching the front two days after Talavera. Ross’s&nbsp;guns were attached to the Light Division, and, with Craufurd,&nbsp;took part in the actions on the Coa and the battle of Busaco.&nbsp;When Masséna began his famous retreat from the lines of&nbsp;Torres Vedras, Ross’s troop was amongst the foremost in the&nbsp;pursuit; at Redinha and Pombal, at Sabugal and Fuentes&nbsp;d’Onor, the “ Chestnuts ” earned great distinction, and in&nbsp;December 1811 their commander received a brevet-majority for&nbsp;his services. He was present at Ciudad Rodrigo and Badajoz,&nbsp;at the Salamanca forts and the battle of Salamanca, still attached&nbsp;to the Light Division. In the campaign of Vittoria, Ross’s&nbsp;guns were continually with the most advanced troops, and after&nbsp;Vittoria they captured the only piece of artillery that remained&nbsp;to the defeated French. A further brevet-promotion and a&nbsp;good service reward came to Ross for his part in the campaign.&nbsp;At Vera in the Pyrenees Ross’s troop was one of the three&nbsp;which played a decisive part in the action, and Vera remains&nbsp;a classical example of the action of horse artillery. <sup>u</sup> A &quot;&nbsp;troop was engaged at St Pierre and Orthez, and at the conclusion of peace returned to England. It was engaged at&nbsp;Waterloo, and though half its guns were disabled the remainder</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
