<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Flemming and Strasburger, Pflüger and Hertwig; the solution, however, is not complete. Again, can we&nbsp;recognize in the ovum any indication of the position of&nbsp;the future embryo—any fixed points, anterior and posterior, lateral or even polar—further, of course, than the&nbsp;obvious distinction due to the presence of yolk? After&nbsp;the old theory of “ evolution ” of the embryo, according&nbsp;to which the egg contained the complete organism in&nbsp;miniature, had been finally replaced by that of epigenesis,&nbsp;the wholly undifferentiated form of the ovum seems to&nbsp;have become tacitly assumed. Recent observers, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.,&nbsp;Van Beneden (see below), have, however, been so far&nbsp;reviving the old view in that they endeavour to distinguish, even in the unfertilized ovum, the position of the&nbsp;ends and sides of the embryo; others dispute this, and&nbsp;an interesting controversy is in progress. The speculation that a more or less considerable share in the differentiation of the ovum might be due to the separation of its&nbsp;various constituents according to their different specific&nbsp;gravities—at first apparently emitted by Jäger,—has also&nbsp;reappeared in this regard. Pflüger has observed the&nbsp;segmentation of Frogs’ ova fixed in various positions, and&nbsp;describes the plane of first segmentation as constantly&nbsp;vertical, whatever might be its angle to the morphological&nbsp;axis of the ovum, uniting black and white poles. Development too was usually normal, save that when the upper&nbsp;hemisphere was entirely white abnormality and death&nbsp;followed, and even if inversion was less complete segmentation often stopped. Further experiments led him to the&nbsp;conclusion that the nervous system, and correspondingly&nbsp;other organs, may develop from any portion of the egg-substance—that the egg in short is “isotropic.” Certain&nbsp;limitations, however, appeared : the blastopore never arose&nbsp;on the upper hemisphere, nor (like the nervous system)&nbsp;ever on the black region, but both always at the intersection of the white area with the third equatorial plane of&nbsp;segmentation. This he terms the point of crystallization&nbsp;of the specialized organism, and goes on to speculate as to&nbsp;the molecular structure of the ovum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">These results have, however, been the subject of keen criticism. Thus Roux showed that the specific gravity of&nbsp;the black pole is distinctly less than that of the white,&nbsp;and found that on eliminating the action of gravity by&nbsp;the use of a centrifugal machine the development remained&nbsp;normal, and on repeating Pfliiger’s own fundamental&nbsp;observations described the axis of segmentation as coinciding with that of the ovum. After similarly eliminating&nbsp;light, heat, and earth-magnetism, he sums .up in precisely&nbsp;opposite terms to Pflüger, who had laid all stress on the&nbsp;influence of the forces of the environment, and regards&nbsp;development as purely a process of self-differentiation.&nbsp;O. Hertwig also maintains that the influence of gravity is&nbsp;only a secondary one, the plane of division being for him&nbsp;determined by the position of the axis of the dividing&nbsp;nucleus, and this again having a definite relation to the&nbsp;form and state of differentiation of the surrounding protoplasm. He admits, however, the indirect importance of&nbsp;gravity on eggs having a yolk, and so leaves the question&nbsp;still to a considerable extent open. In another paper he&nbsp;adopts Pflügers conception of the isotropy of the ovum,&nbsp;holding that the yolk is not so organized that from any&nbsp;definite region of it a definite organ arises, but that the&nbsp;nucleus is the sole centre of activity and control. It is&nbsp;thus evident that a reinvestigation is needed which would&nbsp;embrace the whole question of geotropism. See </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Physiology (Vegetable). </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(12)</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Maturation of the Ovum.—Polar Bodies</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">.—The period of development and nutrition of the ovum may be regarded&nbsp;as complete when the full size and complex structure&nbsp;above described have been reached, and in this state it</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">most frequently leaves the body of the parent. In the majority of cases at least, new changes have still to be&nbsp;gone through before fertilization takes place, still more&nbsp;development; and a series of important structural modifications, doubtless the expression of extensive functional&nbsp;rearrangements, takes place. To this new and obscure&nbsp;phase of the life-history of the ovum the term maturation&nbsp;has conveniently been applied.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Although some of these phenomena have long been familiar to embryologists, the classical investigations are&nbsp;the comparatively recent ones of Biitschli, Oscar Hertwig,&nbsp;and especially Fol (1877); more lately those of Sabatier, of&nbsp;Flemming, and above all of Van Beneden. If we postpone&nbsp;details, the main facts of the process as until recently&nbsp;understood can be most readily grasped from Fol’s figures&nbsp;of the ovum of the Starfish, of which the most important&nbsp;are copied in fig. 10. In the new-laid egg the germinal</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">vesicle is at first a clearly defined sphere, with well-marked membrane, reticulum, and germinal spot. It begins, however, to become irregular and changeful in&nbsp;form, its membrane and reticulum meanwhile disappearing, with the apparent dissolution of a portion of its contents in the yolk. The germinal spot also vanishes, and&nbsp;two ill-defined clear spots are alone distinguishable in the&nbsp;yolk. Treatment with reagents shows these clear spots&nbsp;to correspond to two star-like figures like those of a&nbsp;certain stage of the division of nucleus of an ordinary cell,&nbsp;while in a somewhat later stage a nuclear spindle is shown&nbsp;near the surface of the egg. The upper portion of this is&nbsp;segmented off (surrounded by very little of the protoplasm&nbsp;of the ovum) as a polar body, while the lower portion of&nbsp;the body remains as the “ female pronucleus,” and may be&nbsp;seen surrounded by radial striae. Two or even more polar&nbsp;bodies may be formed, but they never take any part in&nbsp;the subsequent life-history of the ovum, and sooner or&nbsp;later disappear.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In view of the profound theoretic importance of this subject, it is necessary to summarize some of the most important recent&nbsp;observations. Thus Balbiani and Weismann (1882) describe the&nbsp;occurrence of polar vesicles in the ova of Insects, in which they&nbsp;had long been supposed not to occur, and Flemming (1885) represents a nuclear figure which he regards as corresponding to at any&nbsp;rate the first stage of the formation of a polar vesicle, in the ova&nbsp;of Mammals, at the period of bursting of the Graafian follicle.&nbsp;Such researches practically complete the chain of evidence for&nbsp;the generalization that the process of maturation of the ovum is&nbsp;essentially similar in all classes of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Metazoa,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and this not only in its&nbsp;initial stages of internal rearrangement or modification, but even&nbsp;in its later stage of polar vesicle formation. The absence of polar&nbsp;vesicles in parthenogenetic ova (predicted on theoretic grounds)&nbsp;seems, however, possible in some cases, but is by no means certain&nbsp;in all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Our knowledge of the process of maturation has been much extended and modified by the recent elaborate monograph of&nbsp;E. Van Beneden (1883). He finds the egg of </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Ascaris</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> to show not&nbsp;only two definite poles—a “ pole of impregnation ” and an opposite&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">“</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> neutral pole ”—but some indication of the anterior and posterior&nbsp;regions and consequently of the right and left sides of the embryo.&nbsp;The substance of the ovum is also remarkably differentiated,—that</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
