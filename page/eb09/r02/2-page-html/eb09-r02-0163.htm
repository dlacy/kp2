<p><span class="font0">prizes offered by various provincial academies. In 1784 he obtained a medal from the academy of Metz for his&nbsp;essay on the question whether the relatives of a condemned&nbsp;criminal should also be punished ; but the prize was&nbsp;awarded to Lacretelle aîné, an avocat and journalist at&nbsp;Paris, who triumphed again over his provincial antagonist&nbsp;in the Γarisian press, and who in after days when Robespierre was all-powerful was surprised that he was not&nbsp;sent to the guillotine. An éloge on Gresset, the author&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Vert- Vert</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Méchant,</span><span class="font0"> written for the academy of&nbsp;Amiens in 1785, was not more successful; but Robespierre&nbsp;was compensated for these failures by his great popularity&nbsp;in the society of the Rosati at Arras,—a little society whose&nbsp;members prided themselves on being men of fashion and wit,&nbsp;and spent one evening a week in conviviality and in reading poems, epigrams, and vers de société. There the sympathetic quality of Robespierre’s voice, which afterwards did&nbsp;him such good service in the Jacobin Club, always caused&nbsp;his indifferent verses to be loudly applauded by his friends.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Such had been the life of the future republican leader up to 1788, when he took part in the discussion as to the&nbsp;λvay in which the states-general should be elected, showing&nbsp;clearly and forcibly in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Adresse à la Nation Artésienne&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">that, if the former mode of election by the members of&nbsp;the provincial estates was again adopted, the new states-general would not represent the people of France. Necker&nbsp;also perceived this, and therefore determined to make the&nbsp;old royal bailliages and séné-chaussées the units of election.&nbsp;Under this plan the city of Arras was to return twenty-four members to the assembly of the bailliage of Artois,&nbsp;which was to elect the deputies. The corporation claimed&nbsp;the right to a preponderating influence in these city elections, and Robespierre headed the opposition, making himself very conspicuous and drawing up the cahier or table&nbsp;of complaints and grievances, for the guild of the cobblers.&nbsp;Although the leading members of the corporation were&nbsp;elected, their chief opponent succeeded in getting elected&nbsp;with them. In the assembly of the bailliage rivalry ran&nbsp;still higher, but Robespierre had already made his mark&nbsp;in politics ; by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">A vis aux Habitants de Campagne</span><span class="font0"> (Arras,&nbsp;1789), which is almost certainly by him, he secured the&nbsp;support of the country electors, and, though but thirty&nbsp;years of age, poor, and without influence, he was elected&nbsp;fifth deputy of the tiers état of Artois to the states-general.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the states-general met at Versailles on 5th May 1789, the young deputy of Artois already possessed the&nbsp;one faculty which was to lead him to supremacy : he was&nbsp;a fanatic. As Mirabeau said, “ That young man believes&nbsp;what he says ; he will go far.” Without the courage&nbsp;and wide tolerance w<sup>τ</sup>hich make a statesman, without the&nbsp;greatest qualities of an orator, without the belief in himself&nbsp;which marks a great man, nervous, timid, and suspicious,&nbsp;Robespierre yet believed in the doctrines of Rousseau with&nbsp;all his heart, and would have gone to death for them ;&nbsp;and in the belief that they would eventually succeed and&nbsp;regenerate France and mankind he was ready to work&nbsp;with unwearied patience. While the constituent assembly&nbsp;occupied itself in drawing up an unworkable constitution as the grand panacea, Robespierre turned from the&nbsp;assembly of provincial avocats and wealthy bourgeois to&nbsp;the people of Paris. However, he spoke frequently in the&nbsp;constituent assembly, and often with great success, and&nbsp;was eventually recognized as second only to Pétion de&nbsp;Villeneuve—if second to him—as a leader of the small body&nbsp;of the extreme left,—the thirty voices, as Mirabeau contemptuously called them. It is hardly necessary to examine minutely Robespierre’s speeches and behaviour before&nbsp;1791, when the death of Mirabeau left the way clear for&nbsp;the influence of his party ; but what is noteworthy, as&nbsp;proving the religious cast of his mind and his belief in the&nbsp;necessity of à religion, is that he spoke several times in&nbsp;favour of the lower clergy and laboured to get their pensions&nbsp;increased. When he instinctively felt that his doctrines&nbsp;would have no success in the assembly, he turned to the&nbsp;Jacobin Club, which had consisted originally of the Breton&nbsp;deputies only, but which, after the assembly moved to&nbsp;Paris, began to admit among its members various leaders&nbsp;of the Parisian bourgeoisie. As time went on, many of the&nbsp;more intelligent artisans and petits commerçants became&nbsp;members of the club, and among such men Robespierre&nbsp;found the hearers he sought. They did more than listen&nbsp;to him : they idolized him ; the fanatical leader had found&nbsp;fanatics to follow him, and their ultimate supremacy became merely a question of time. As the wealthier bourgeois of Paris and deputies of a more moderate type seceded&nbsp;to the club of ’89 the influence of the old leaders of the&nbsp;Jacobins (Barnave, Duport, Charles de Lameth)diminished;&nbsp;and, when they themselves, alarmed at the progress of&nbsp;the Revolution, founded the club of the Feuillants in&nbsp;1791, the followers of Robespierre dominated the Jacobin&nbsp;Club. The death of Mirabeau strengthened Robespierre’s&nbsp;influence in the assembly; but in May 1791 he proved&nbsp;his lack of statesmanlike insight and his jealous suspicion&nbsp;of his colleagues by proposing and carrying the motion&nbsp;that no deputies who sat in the constituent could sit in&nbsp;the succeeding assembly. The flight of the king on 2lst&nbsp;June and his arrest at Varennes excited Robespierre’s&nbsp;suspicions, and made him declare himself at the Jacobin&nbsp;Club to be “ ni monarchiste ni républicain.” But the&nbsp;vigorous conduct of Lafayette and the National Guard on&nbsp;the Champ de Mars on l7th July 1791 terrified him, for&nbsp;he believed that he was a predestined victim, until he&nbsp;was succoured by Duplay, a cabinetmaker in the Rue St&nbsp;Honoré, and an ardent admirer of his, in whose house he&nbsp;lived (with but two short intervals) till his death. At&nbsp;last came his day of triumph, when on 30th September,&nbsp;on the dissolution of the constituent assembly, the people&nbsp;of Paris crowned Pétion and himself as the two incorruptible patriots.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the dissolution of the assembly he returned for a short visit to Arras, where he met with a triumphant reception. In November he returned to Paris, and on 18th&nbsp;December made a speech which marks a new epoch in his&nbsp;life. Brissot, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dme politique</span><span class="font0"> of the Girondin party&nbsp;which had been formed in the legislative assembly, urged&nbsp;vehemently that war should be declared against Austria,&nbsp;and the queen was equally urgent in the hope that a victorious army might restore the old absolutism of the Bourbons. Two men opposed the projects of the queen and&nbsp;the Girondins,—Marat and Robespierre: Marat opposed&nbsp;them for statesmanlike reasons (see Marat), and Robespierre on humanitary grounds and because as a follower&nbsp;of Rousseau he disliked war. This opposition from those&nbsp;whom they had expected to aid them irritated the Girondins greatly, and from that moment began the struggle&nbsp;which ended in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">coups Pétat</span><span class="font0"> of 3lst May and 2d June&nbsp;1793. Guadet accused Robespierre of superstition in believing in a providence, and declared that, as the people’s&nbsp;idol, he ought to ostracize himself for the good of his&nbsp;country. Robespierre persisted in his opposition to the&nbsp;war, and the Girondins, especially Brissot, attacked him&nbsp;so violently that in April 1792 he resigned the post of&nbsp;public prosecutor at the tribunal of Paris, which he had&nbsp;Held since February, and started a journal, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Le Défenseur&nbsp;de la Constitution,</span><span class="font0"> in his own defence. It is noteworthy&nbsp;that during the summer months of 1792, in which the&nbsp;fate ,f the Bourbon dynasty was being sealed, neither the&nbsp;Girondins in the legislative assembly nor Robespierre&nbsp;took any active part in overthrowing it.
