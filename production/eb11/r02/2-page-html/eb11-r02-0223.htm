<p><span class="font2">breeding season, when they are on guard over their harems of from ten to fifteen wives—the sunbirds, with their long curved beaks&nbsp;that search out the nectar of flowers, and the honey-guides, which,&nbsp;with their agitated “ chuck, chuck,” lead the wayfarer to bees’&nbsp;nests with expectation of joining in the plunder. The small birds&nbsp;of Rhodesia are usually very brilliantly coloured, the most distinguished being what is known as the blue jay, with its bright,&nbsp;iridescent, light blue plumage.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Flora..—</span><span class="font2">The vegetation of the territory is luxurious and mainly subtropical, but in the lower valleys the flora assumes a tropical&nbsp;aspect. The country is well wooded and in this respect differs&nbsp;from the high tablelands farther south. The trees as a rule attain&nbsp;no greater height than about 20 ft., but in some districts, such as&nbsp;South Melsctter and Wankies, there are remains of forests of large&nbsp;timber. The small growth of the trees is said to be due to the&nbsp;annual veld fires, and it is noticeable that native trees that are&nbsp;protected attain a much greater height. As a rule the wood is&nbsp;either very hard or very soft, so that timber for building has still&nbsp;to be imported, although the existing timber is useful for mining&nbsp;purposes. One of the hardest woods is the so-called Rhodesian&nbsp;teak (native Ikusi), which is about 50% harder than real teak&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">CTectona grandis).</span><span class="font2"> The trees most commonly met with arc mapane,&nbsp;used for poles; umkamba, resembling mahogany; m’lanji cedar,&nbsp;chiefly found along the eastern border; umsasa, used for firewood;&nbsp;impachla, the native wisteria. Among other trees are the baobab&nbsp;with enormous veiy soft trunk, the fruit being a large nut containing&nbsp;citrate of magnesia, which natives use to make a cooling drink;&nbsp;the umvagaz—or blood-wood—which issues a blood-coloured juice&nbsp;when cut, and the umkuna, or hissing tree, which hisses when an&nbsp;incision is made. The barks of the umâasa, the umhondo, and the&nbsp;umgosa are much used by natives for binding fibres in making huts&nbsp;and are also used for tanning. The bark of the baobab yields a&nbsp;fine fibre which natives use in making excellent game nets and&nbsp;fishing nets. The native fruit-bearing trees are the fig (many&nbsp;varieties), the mahobohobo or umjanje, resembling the Ioquat,&nbsp;the Kaffir plum, very sour and totally different from the Kaffir&nbsp;plum of Cape Colony, and the Kaffir orange. Among the shrubs&nbsp;the proteas, or sugar bushes, with their nectar-storcd flowers, arc&nbsp;the most frequent. The mimosa thorn, although more of the&nbsp;nature of a tree, grows in dense masses, chiefly in the western&nbsp;province.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The period of the year when flowers begin to bloom is rather remarkable. After the long spell of dry weather, lasting from five&nbsp;to seven months, and before any rain has fallen, blooms appear all&nbsp;over the veld. Most of such flowers are those of bulbous plants&nbsp;or plants with large roots that have been stored with nourishment&nbsp;during the previous growing wet season. The flowers are sustained&nbsp;by this stock of food until the rains appear again to replenish the&nbsp;roots. Even grass sprouts green over the earth before the rains&nbsp;appear, and -the hard-baked veld is pierced by the shoots of the&nbsp;gladiolus, the orchid, the asparagus, the solanum, the convolvulus&nbsp;and many other flowers. When the rains are far advanced, the&nbsp;annuals shoot rapidly and make a second tshow of bloom. A&nbsp;peculiarity of the early spring shoots on trees and shrubs is that&nbsp;they have not the green tints of the colder regions, but are all shades&nbsp;of brown and orange and red and yellow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">One of the chief features of Rhodesia is the vast stretches of grass-covered veld, the grasses varying from a few inches to 15 ft.&nbsp;in height and numbering about 100 different varieties. * Along the&nbsp;rivers are to be found palms, tree ferns, bananas, dracaenas and&nbsp;other hot climate plants. Rubber, indigo and cotton are indigenous&nbsp;and there are groves of lemon trees, but these were most probably&nbsp;introduced by early settlers. Tobacco, which grows luxuriantly,&nbsp;may also have been introduced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inhabitants.—</span><span class="font1">In Southern Rhodesia about half the European population, which in 1909 was approximately 16,500, is British&nbsp;born or born of British parents, and about one-third is South&nbsp;African born. There are about 11,500 males and 5000 females,&nbsp;and the population is equally divided between the urban and&nbsp;rural areas. In rural areas the chief occupations are mining&nbsp;and agriculture. Industrial pursuits, including mining, engage&nbsp;about 25% of the population, 8% are employed in agriculture,&nbsp;and 15% in commerce. Mashonaland has 7500 white inhabitants, and Matabeleland 9000. There are about 2000 Asiatics&nbsp;in Southern Rhodesia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Natives</span><span class="font1"> of Rhodesia belong to the Bantu-Negro stock and are roughly divisible into two groups; those long settled&nbsp;in the country, and the Amazulu, who during the 19th century&nbsp;left Zululand and, passing through the more southern regions,&nbsp;overran Rhodesia and settled in Matabeleland. The Barotse&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.)</span><span class="font1"> are mainly settled in North-West Rhodesia. In Southern&nbsp;Rhodesia, in spite of incursions from Portuguese territory and&nbsp;from the north, the natives can be still clearly divided into&nbsp;Mashona and Matabele, living in the eastern and western provinces respectively. The name Mashona is not used by the&nbsp;natives but is useful as distinguishing the allied tribes of the&nbsp;eastern division from the Matabele in the west. The languages&nbsp;of the Mashona tribes arc allicd and are distinct from that of&nbsp;the Matabele (or Zulu), but it is uncertain whether these&nbsp;Mashona tongues should be regarded merely as different&nbsp;dialects, or !languages as different as those of the various&nbsp;nations of Europe (but see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bantu Languages).</span><span class="font1"> The tribes&nbsp;round Salisbury and extending as far as Marondella in the&nbsp;east and about 100 m. north are clearly branches of the&nbsp;Vasezuru people, that is, the people from “ higher up,” the&nbsp;“ higher up ” being a region in the south-east. Their history&nbsp;can be traced from about the beginning of the 18th century;&nbsp;but there is a great lack of tradition amongst this class of&nbsp;native, which is distinctly inferior in type to the Matabele in&nbsp;the west.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Farther north there are the Makorikori and the Mabudja or Mabushla. It would appear that the country in which these&nbsp;people now dwell was formerly in the possession of the Barotse,&nbsp;and some of the present chiefs obtained their positions by permission of the Barotse. Previously ,</span><span class="font3">■</span><span class="font1"> according to Portuguese&nbsp;documents of the 16th and 17th centuries, the Makaranga or&nbsp;Makalanga now located in the south round about Victoria had&nbsp;possession of the country as far north as the Zambezi. Their&nbsp;language is allied to that of the present inhabitants, but in&nbsp;many respects is widely different and of late has become&nbsp;more so owing to intercourse with the Matabele. Along&nbsp;the eastern border two more tribes can * be differentiated,&nbsp;namely, Umtasa’s people in the north and those speaking the&nbsp;Chindawo language in the south. Their languages are merely&nbsp;variants of the language spoken in the Salisbury and Mazoe&nbsp;districts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">All the tribes in the eastern province have very, similar habits and customs. Their huts are circular with a wall a foot or two&nbsp;high, made of poles and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">daga</span><span class="font1"> (mud) surmounted by a conical&nbsp;thatched roof. They thus differ from the beehive huts of the&nbsp;Zulus. They are built indiscriminately together and are not&nbsp;surrounded by stockades. The whole family dwells in the same&nbsp;hut along with dogs, goats and fowls, and sometimes even with&nbsp;cattle, though there are usually separate kraals for their cattle.&nbsp;The kraals are as a rule filthy, but the inside of the hut is kept&nbsp;clean. There is a special place for a fire, and a raised portion&nbsp;of the mud floor on which to sleep, but no furniture. Their&nbsp;mealie fields are usually some distance from the place of abode,&nbsp;but their tobacco gardens are near their huts. Their main&nbsp;object in life seems to be to grow sufficient grain for food and&nbsp;beer. The grain. they store in granaries, resembling small&nbsp;huts, placed on rocks or on stakes, out of the reach of white ants&nbsp;and secure from the depredations of animals. They amuse&nbsp;themselves occasionally by making earthenware pots which&nbsp;are very soft and easily broken, or by engaging in iron-work or&nbsp;brass-wire work for ornamentation. In the south they are&nbsp;quite clever in making water-tight baskets from rushes grown&nbsp;by the Sabi river. In their religious beliefs spirits play a great&nbsp;part. Above all there is a vague idea of a Supreme Being whom&nbsp;they call </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mwari.</span><span class="font1"> They have a fixed belief in the spirits of&nbsp;their ancestors, the spirits of the witch-doctors, the spirits of the&nbsp;Matabele, the spirits of old women, the spirits of the foolish,&nbsp;the spirits of baboons, &amp;c. Every occurrence is attributed to&nbsp;the influence of a spirit, and if the occurrence is an evil one a&nbsp;feast and dance of propitiation are held. Feasts of thanksgiving are also held on such occasions as the gathering of the&nbsp;first-fruits, the harvest festival, or on the return from a long and&nbsp;dangerous journey. Of the tribes already mentioned the most&nbsp;advanced are Umtasa’s people and the Makaranga. The probable connexion of the tribes now inhabiting Mashonaland with&nbsp;the architects of the ancient stone buildings which are scattered&nbsp;over the country is discussed in the section </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeology.</span><span class="font1"> Of&nbsp;these ruins the most extensive are situated near Victoria and are&nbsp;known as Zimbabwe </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the western province the Matabele, or rather Amandabele, are the descendants of the Zulus who trekked under the</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
