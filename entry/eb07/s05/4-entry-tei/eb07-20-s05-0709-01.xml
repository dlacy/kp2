is a double steam-pipe, either branch of which may be employed according as the engine is to go forward or backward. A A is the cylinder firmly fixed on a stone foundation, and in its centre is an axis XX, upon one side of which and eccentric to the cylinder is an inner cylinder or barrel turned quite true, and fixed to revolve with the axis X, and so to form the piston P, which is to receive and give out the force of the steam. RR furnishes the <hi rend="italic">point d'appui,</hi> the surface of reaction, which resists the force of the steam and forms a fixed obstacle. It is a flat slide or sluice, (see fig. 5,) resting on the barrel piston P, and maintained by guides always in a vertical position. It passes into the cylinder through a rectangular stuffing box, and is raised and depressed by a small eccentric pin <hi rend="italic">x x,</hi> so as to remain always upon the surface of the piston drum. All the working surfaces are rendered steam-tight by metallic packings. EEE is the eduction passage into the condenser or the open air, DD are slide-valves to be reversed when the engine is to go backwards. On the revolving axis of the piston X are toothed wheels, <hi rend="italic">gg,</hi> working other two, <hi rend="italic">gg,</hi> which have a common axis <hi rend="italic">zz,</hi> carrying a fly-wheel, and driving the machinery to be worked by the engine.

The entablature supported by the columns, uniting both engines in one design, gives massiness of appearance, as well as great strength to the structure. In plate <hi rend="smallcaps">cccclxxxii</hi> is seen the apparatus for working the engines expansively.

The other letters refer to the same parts as before.</p><p>Plate <hi rend="smallcaps">cccclxxxix.</hi> In this plate are represented two engines of direct connexion, constructed by Messrs Tod and M'Gregor, Glasgow.</p><p>In figs. 1 and 2 of this plate, the crank S of the engine is placed directly above the cylinder A ; the piston-rod K carries a cross-head J, which is guided to move in the vertical direction by two cross guides <hi rend="italic">gg,</hi> one at each extremity, whose ends slide upon the vertical pillars <hi rend="italic">pp,</hi> which sustain the framing for the support of the crank-axle. From each end of the piston cross-head depends a side rod H H, whose lower extremity, together with the ends of the side rods PP, which depend from the cross-tail Q of the connecting rod R, are attached to the end of a side lever GG. To the opposite end of the side levers are attached the side rods N of the air-pump, and on either side of its centre the side rods of the feed and bilge pumps F.

Fig. 1 of this plate is a side-elevation, and fig. 2 an elevation of the cylinder end, of a pair of marine engines constructed by Messrs Seaward of the Canal Ironworks, Limehouse, for H. Μ. steam-frigates Gorgon, Cyclops, Prometheus, and Electo. These engines are of a peculiar construction ; the crank, as in the engines of the last plate, being directly above the cylinder, the connecting rod only intervening between it and the piston-rod. They are of the class of the vibrating pillar-engines, the pillar which supports the beam turning upon a centre at its lower end.
