He resigned, however, on the 2nd of November, owing to the king’s refusal&nbsp;to settle the difficulties with Austria by an appeal to arms.&nbsp;In August 1852 he was appointed director of military education; but the rest of his life was devoted mainly to literary&nbsp;pursuits. He died on the 25th of December 1853.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAE, JOHN (1813-1893), Scottish Arctic explorer, was born on the 30th of September 1813, in the Orkney Islands, which&nbsp;he left at an early age to study medicine at Edinburgh University, qualifying as a surgeon in 1833. He made a voyage&nbsp;in a professional capacity in one of the ships of the Hudson’s&nbsp;Bay Company, and entering the service of the company was&nbsp;resident surgeon for ten years at their station at Moose Factory,&nbsp;at the head of James Bay. In 1846 he made a boat-voyage&nbsp;to Repulse Bay, and having wintered there, in the following&nbsp;spring surveyed 700 miles of new coast-line connecting the&nbsp;earlier surveys of Ross and Parry. An account of this expedition, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">A Narrative of an Expedition to the Shores of the Arctic&nbsp;Sea in 1846 and 1847,</span><span class="font1"> was published by him in 1850. During&nbsp;a visit to London in 1848 he joined the expedition which was&nbsp;then preparing to go out under Sir John Richardson in search&nbsp;of Franklin; and in 1851, at the request of the Government&nbsp;and with a very slender outfit, he travelled some 5300 miles,&nbsp;much of it on foot, and explored and mapped 700 miles of new&nbsp;coast on the south side of Wollaston and Victoria Lands. For&nbsp;this achievement he received the Founder’s gold medal of the&nbsp;Royal Geographical Society. In 1853 he commanded another&nbsp;boat-expedition which was fitted out by the Hudson’s Bay&nbsp;Company, which connected the surveys of Ross with that of&nbsp;Deane and Simpson, and proved King William’s Land to be&nbsp;an island. It was on this journey that he obtained the first&nbsp;authentic news regarding the fate of Franklin, thereby winning&nbsp;the reward of £10, 000 promised by the admiralty. He subsequently travelled across Iceland, and in Greenland and the&nbsp;northern parts of America, surveying routes for telegraph lines.&nbsp;Dr Rae attributed much to his success in Arctic travel to his&nbsp;adoption of the methods of the Eskimo, a people whom he&nbsp;had studied very closely. He was a keen sportsman, an&nbsp;accurate and scientific observer. He died at his house in London&nbsp;and was buried in the Orkney Islands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAE BARELI, a town and district of British India, in the Lucknow division of the United Provinces. The town is on the&nbsp;river Sai, 48 m. S. E. of Lucknow, on the Oudh &amp; Rohilkhand&nbsp;railway. Pop. (1901) 15, 880. It possesses many architectural&nbsp;features, chief of which is a strong and spacious fort erected&nbsp;in 1403, and constructed of bricks 2 ft. long by 1 ft. thick&nbsp;and 1½ wide. Among other ancient buildings are the magnificent palace and tomb of nawab Jahan Khan, governor in&nbsp;the time of Shah Jahan, and four fine mosques.

<p><span class="font1">The District of Rae Bareli has an area of 1748 sq. m. The general aspect of the district is slightly undulating, and&nbsp;the country is beautifully wooded. The soil is remarkably&nbsp;fertile, and the cultivation of a high class. The principal&nbsp;rivers of the district are the Ganges and the Sai: the former&nbsp;skirts it for 54 miles and is everywhere navigable for boats&nbsp;of 40 tons; the latter traverses it from N. W. to S. E. In&nbsp;1901 the population was 1, 033, 761, showing a slight decrease&nbsp;during the decade. The principal crops are rice, pulse, wheat,&nbsp;barley, millet and poppy. Rae Bareli town is connected&nbsp;with Lucknow by a branch of the Oudh &amp; Rohilkhand railway,&nbsp;which in 1898 was extended to Benares.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAEBURN, SIR HENRY (1756-1823), Scottish portrait-painter, was born at Stockbridge, a suburb of Edinburgh, on the 4th of March 1756, the son of a manufacturer óf the city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">He was early left an orphan. Being placed in Heriot’s Hospital, he received there the elements of a sound education, and at&nbsp;the age of fifteen was apprenticed to a goldsmith in Edinburgh.&nbsp;Here he had some little opportunity for the practice of the&nbsp;humbler kinds of art, and various pieces of jewelry, mourning&nbsp;rings, and the like, adorned with minute drawings on ivory&nbsp;by his hand, are still extant. Soon he took to the production&nbsp;of carefully finished miniatures; and, meeting with success&nbsp;and patronage, he extended his practice to oil-painting, being&nbsp;all the while quite self-taught. The worthy goldsmith his&nbsp;master watched the progress of his pupil with interest, gave&nbsp;him every encouragement, and introduced him to David Martin,&nbsp;who had been the favourite assistant of Allan Ramsay junior,&nbsp;and was now the leading portrait-painter in Edinburgh. Raeburn received considerable assistance from Martin, and was&nbsp;especially aided by the loan of portraits to copy. Soon the&nbsp;young painter had gained sufficient skill to render it advisable&nbsp;that he should devote himself exclusively to painting. When he&nbsp;was in his twenty-second year he was asked to paint the portrait&nbsp;of a young lady whom he had previously observed and admired&nbsp;when he was sketching from nature in the fields. She was the&nbsp;daughter of Peter Edgar of Bridgelands and widow of Count&nbsp;Leslie. The lady was speedily fascinated by the handsome and&nbsp;intellectual young artist, and in a month she became his wife,&nbsp;bringing him an ample fortune. This early insurance against&nbsp;the risks of his chosen profession, did not, however, diminish&nbsp;his anxiety to excel. The acquisition of wealth affected neither&nbsp;his enthusiasm nor his industry, but rather spurred him to&nbsp;greater efforts to acquire a thorough knowledge of his craft.&nbsp;After the approved fashion of artists of the time, it was resolved&nbsp;that Raeburn should visit Italy, and he accordingly started&nbsp;with his wife. In London he was kindly received by Sir Joshua&nbsp;Reynolds, who gave him excellent advice as to his study in&nbsp;Rome, especially recommending to his attention the works of&nbsp;Michelangelo. He also offered him more substantial pecuniary&nbsp;aid, which was declined as unneeded; but Raeburn carried&nbsp;with him to Italy many valuable introductions from the&nbsp;president of the Academy. In Rome he made the acquaintance&nbsp;of Gavin Hamilton, of Batoni, and of Byers. For the advice&nbsp;of the last-named he used to acknowledge himself greatly&nbsp;indebted, particularly for the recommendation that “ he&nbsp;should never copy an object from memory, but, from the&nbsp;principal figure to the minutest accessory, have it placed before&nbsp;him. ” After two years of study in Italy he returned to Edinburgh in 1787, where he began a most successful career as a&nbsp;portrait-painter. In that year he executed an admirable seated&nbsp;portrait of the second Lord President Dundas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Of his earlier portraiture we have interesting examples in the bust-likeness of Mrs Johnstone of Baldovie and in the&nbsp;three-quarter-length of Dr James Hutton, works which, if they&nbsp;are somewhat timid and tentative in handling and wanting in&nbsp;the trenchant brush-work and assured mastery of subsequent&nbsp;productions, are full of delicacy and character. The portraits&nbsp;of John Clerk, Lord Eldin, and of Principal Hill of St Andrews&nbsp;belong to a somewhat later period. Raeburn was fortunate&nbsp;in the time in which he practised portraiture. Sir Walter&nbsp;Scott, Blair, Mackenzie, Woodhouselee, Robertson, Home,&nbsp;Ferguson, and Dugald Stewart were resident in Edinburgh, and&nbsp;they all, along with a host of others less celebrated, honoured&nbsp;the painter’s canvases. Of bis fully matured manner we could&nbsp;have no finer examples than bis own portrait and that of the&nbsp;Rev. Sir Henry Moncrieff Wellwood, the bust of Dr Wardrop&nbsp;of Torbane Hill, the two full-lengths of Adam Rolland of Gask,&nbsp;the remarkable paintings of Lord Newton and Dr Alexander&nbsp;Adam in the National Gallery of Scotland, and that of William&nbsp;Macdonald of St Martin’s. It was commonly believed that&nbsp;Raeburn was less successful in his female than in his male&nbsp;portraits, but the exquisite full-length of his wife, the smaller&nbsp;likeness of Mrs R. Scott Moncrieff in the Scottish National&nbsp;Gallery, and that of Mrs Robert Bell, and others, are sufficient&nbsp;to prove that he could portray all the grace and beauty of the&nbsp;gentler sex.</span></p>
