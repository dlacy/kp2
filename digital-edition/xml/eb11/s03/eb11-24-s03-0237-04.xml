The derivation of the word has given rise to some curiously far-fetched guesses; thus it has been referred to the Holy Land, <hi rend="italic">La Sainte Terre,</hi> where pilgrims lingered and loitered, or to the supposed tendency to idle propensities of those who possess no landed property, <hi rend="italic">sans terre.</hi> The most probable suggestions are (1) that of Wedgwood, who connects it with a word in exactly the English sense which appears in various forms in Scandinavian languages, Icel. <hi rend="italic">slentr,</hi> Dan. <hi rend="italic">slentre,</hi> Swed. <hi rend="italic">slentra,</hi> cf. <hi rend="italic">slen,</hi> sloth, <hi rend="italic">slunt,</hi> lout; this derivation assumes the disappearance of the <hi rend="italic">l.</hi> (2) That supported by Skeat, and first propounded by BIackley <hi rend="italic">(Word Gossip,</hi> 1869), which connects it with the Middle Eng. <hi rend="italic">aunter,</hi> adventure; it may represent the Fr. <hi rend="italic">s'aventurer,</hi> to go out on an adventure, and the sense-development would be from the idle and apparently objectless expeditions of knights-errant in search of adventure.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
