a sect of Christians of the third centuryâ€™, that embraced the opinions of Sabellius, a philosopher of Egypt, who openly taught that there is but one person in the Godhead. The Sabellians maintained, that the Word and the Holy Spirit are only virtues, emanations, or functions of the Deity, and held, that he who is in heaven is the Father of all things ; that he descended into the virgin, became a child, and was born of her as a son ; and that having accomplished the mystery of our salvation, he diffused himself on the apostles in tongues of fire, and was then denominated the Holy Ghost. This they explained by comparing God to the sun, the illuminative virtue or quality of which was the Word, and its warming virtue the Holy Spirit. The Word, they taught, was darted, like a divine ray, to accomplish the work of redemption ; and that being re-ascended to heaven, the influences of the Father were communicated after a like manner to the apostles.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
