        <p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Publician Edict.—</span><span
                class="font1">There were necessarily many changes during the period in the law of
                property and of minor real rights,&nbsp;several of them of no mean importance. But
                the greatest of all was&nbsp;that effected by the Publician edict@@<sup>1</sup>
                indirectly recognizing the&nbsp;validity (1) of what Theophilus calls </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">dominium bonitarium</span><span
                class="font1"> as an&nbsp;actual though inferior ownership of </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi,</span><span class="font1"> and
                (2) of what&nbsp;got the name of </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">bonae fidci possessio</span><span class="font1"> as a
                fictitious ownership of&nbsp;either </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res nec mancipi,</span><span class="font1">
                valid against all the world&nbsp;except the true </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">dominus.</span><span class="font1"> The accounts we
                possess of this edict are&nbsp;somewhat inconsistent and even contradictory; the
                explanation&nbsp;may be that it went through a process of amendment and
                expansion&nbsp;at the hands of successive praetors, and that eventually it may
                have&nbsp;had more than one section, without our always being able to say
                to&nbsp;which of them the criticism of a particular commentator is
                directed.&nbsp;But there is no doubt of its general tendency,—of the defects
                it&nbsp;was meant to correct and of the way in which the correction
                was&nbsp;accomplished.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">One of the defects was this: if a man had taken a transfer of a
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span
                class="font1"> from its rightful owner, but simply by tradition&nbsp;instead of by
                mancipation or cession in court, he did not acquire&nbsp;</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">dominium ex jure Quiritium,</span><span class="font1">
                and the transferrer remained undivested. The result was that the latter was in law
                entitled to raise&nbsp;a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rei
                vindicatio</span><span class="font1"> and oust the transferee whose money he might
                have&nbsp;in his pocket, while if a third party had obtained possession of
                the&nbsp;thing, but in such a way as not to be amenable to an interdict,
                the&nbsp;transferee could have no effectual vindication against him, as he&nbsp;was
                not in a position to prove </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >dominium ex jure Quiritium.</span><span class="font1"> The&nbsp;first difficulty
                was overcome by the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">exceptio
                rei venditae et traditae,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">also a praetorian remedy,
                and probably older than the Publician ;&nbsp;to the transferrer’s vindication on the
                strength of his unextinguished quiritary right the transferee pleaded sale and
                delivery as&nbsp;an effectual praetorian defence. But, when a third party was
                in&nbsp;possession, and the transferee by simple delivery had to take
                the&nbsp;initiative, the position was more complicated. Such third party&nbsp;might
                be in perfect good faith ; he might even have acquired from&nbsp;the original
                transferrer and fortified his acquisition with a formal&nbsp;conveyance. But that
                was no sufficient reason in equity why he&nbsp;should be allowed to defeat the prior
                right of the original transferee, who, if he had possessed for the requisite period
                of usucapion&nbsp;before the third party came upon the scene, would have cured
                the&nbsp;defect of the informal delivery and acquired an unassailable quiritary
                right. So the praetor announced in his edict that, if a man&nbsp;came to him and
                represented that he had bought a </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">res mancipi</span><span class="font1"> from&nbsp;its
                owner, and had had it delivered to him, but had lost possession within the period of
                usucapion, he (the praetor) would allow&nbsp;him a vindication embodying a fiction
                of completed usucapion&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >(infra,</span><span class="font1"> p. 708), with which he might proceed either
                against the&nbsp;transferrer or any third party withholding the thing in
                question.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The publication of such an edict and the formula of the action based
                upon it—which, though of praetorian origin, was in many&nbsp;respects dealt with as
                an </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">actio juris
                civilis</span><span class="font1"> and just a variety of the&nbsp;</span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">rei vindicatio—</span><span class="font1"
                >had the same effect as if the legislature had directly&nbsp;enacted that in future
                delivery of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">res
                mancipi</span><span class="font1"> in pursuance of a&nbsp;sale or other good cause
                would confer a right of ownership in it&nbsp;even before usucapion had been
                completed. Till completed, however, the transferee was not quiritary owner : the
                thing in question&nbsp;was only mi </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">bonis,</span><span class="font1"> “of his belongings,”
                and the legal title, though&nbsp;a very empty one—</span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">nudum jus Quiritium—</span><span class="font1">remained
                in the transferrer ; it was only with the completion of the usucapion that
                it&nbsp;became the transferee’s </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">pleno jure.</span><span class="font1"> The inevitable
                result of the recognition of this tenure </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">in bonis</span><span class="font1"> was that mancipation
                came to be&nbsp;regarded in many cases as an unnecessary formality; and the
                marvel&nbsp;is that it continued to hold its ground at all. The explanation&nbsp;may
                be that it afforded a substratum for and gave force of law to&nbsp;the </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">verba nuncupata</span><span class="font1">
                that accompanied the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">negotium
                per aes et&nbsp;libram</span><span class="font1"> ; and, although many of these
                might quite well be thrown&nbsp;into the form of stipulations, yet there were others
                that it may&nbsp;have been thought safer to leave to take effect under the
                provisions&nbsp;of the earlier law.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The second case that was met by the Publician edict—whether - as
                originally published or by an amendment of it cannot be determined—was that of the
                </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bona fide</span><span
                class="font1"> transferee of a thing by purchase&nbsp;or other sufficient title who,
                having lost possession of it before&nbsp;usucapion, found to his cost that the
                transferrer had not been its&nbsp;owner, that no ownership therefore had been
                transmitted to him&nbsp;(the transferee), and that consequently he was not in a
                position to&nbsp;raise a vindication with its averment of </span><span class="font1"
                style="font-style:italic;">dominium ex jure Quiritium.@@2 </span><span class="font1"
                >As against the true owner, whose property had been disposed of by a stranger behind
                his back, there would have been no&nbsp;equity in giving him an action ; but as
                against all the world except&nbsp;the true owner his “ better right ” was recognized
                by the praetor,&nbsp;who accorded to him also a vindication proceeding on a fiction
                of&nbsp;completed usucapion, for usucapion cured the defect of </span><span
                class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">his</span><span class="font1">
                title,&nbsp;just as it did that of the bonitarian owner. In this way the
                praetors&nbsp;introduced that </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                >bonae fidci possessio</span><span class="font1"> which was worked out
                with&nbsp;much skill by the jurists of the early empire, and which assumed&nbsp;very
                large proportions in the Justinianian law when the term of&nbsp;prescription had
                been greatly extended, and the difficulty of proving&nbsp;property (as distinguished
                from </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">bona fide</span><span
                class="font1"> possession) consequently&nbsp;very much increased.</span></p><div>

                </span><span class="font1">It is impossible within the limits of an article such as
                    this to indicate a tithe of the amendments that were effected on the law of
                    obligations during the period&nbsp;whose distinguishing features were the rise

                    gentium</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the construction of the praetor’s
                    edict. In every branch of it there&nbsp;was an advance not by steps but by
                    strides,—in that of obligations&nbsp;arising from contract, of those arising
                    from delict, and of those&nbsp;arising from facts and circumstances, such as
                    unjustifiable enrichment at another person’s cost.@@<sup>4</sup> The law of

                    >fidejussio,</span><span class="font1"> received considerable&nbsp;attention,
                    and formed the subject of a series of legislative enactments for limiting a
                    surety’s liability ; while that of agency, which&nbsp;was sparingly admitted in
                    Rome, had a valuable contribution from&nbsp;the praetorian edict in the
                    recognition of a man’s liability, more or&nbsp;less qualified, for the
                    contractual debts of his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >filiifamilias</span><span class="font1"> and slaves,&nbsp;as also, and without
                    qualification, for the debts properly contracted&nbsp;of persons, whether
                    domestically subject to him or not, who were&nbsp;managing a business on his
                    account, or whom he had placed in&nbsp;command of a ship belonging to him. The
                    development of the law&nbsp;in the matter of obligations generally was greatly
                    facilitated by the&nbsp;praetorian simplification of procedure and the
                    introduction of new&nbsp;forms of actions,—the instruction to a judge, “Whatever
                    in respect&nbsp;thereof the defendant ought to give to or do for the plaintiff,
                    in that&nbsp;condemn him,” preceded by a statement of the cause of
                    action,&nbsp;giving wide scope for the recognition of new sources of
                    liability.</span></p>
            <p><span class="font1">The origin of the verbal contract of stipulation and its
                    actionability under the Silian and Calpurnian laws have already been explained
                    (pp. 694, 684). It was theoretically a formal contract,&nbsp;</span><span
                    class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1">
                    creative of obligation on the strength of the formal question&nbsp;and answer
                    interchanged by the parties, even though no substantial&nbsp;ground of debt
                    might underlie it; but in time it became the practice to introduce words—the
                    single word </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >recte</span><span class="font1"> was enough—excluding liability in case of
                    malpractice </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(clausula
                    doli);</span><span class="font1"> and finally even&nbsp;that became unnecessary
                    when the praetors had introduced the&nbsp;general </span><span class="font1"

                    as an equitable defence to any&nbsp;personal action. And it was essentially
                    productive only of unilateral obligation, </span><span class="font1"
                    style="font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1"> the respondent in
                    the interrogatory alone&nbsp;incurred liability ; if mutual obligations were
                    intended it was&nbsp;necessary that each should promise for his own part, with
                    the&nbsp;result that two contracts were executed which were perfectly
                    independent. Originally the only words that could be employed
                    were&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;"
                    >spondesl</span><span class="font1"> on the one side, </span><span class="font1"

                    in this form the&nbsp;contract was yurts </span><span class="font1"

                    become&nbsp;of daily use amongst the former in the still simpler

                    the&nbsp;contract came in time, by the simplification of the w’ords of
                    interrogatory and response—the substitution of the condictions of

                    what&nbsp;were called necessary (in contradistinction to voluntary)
