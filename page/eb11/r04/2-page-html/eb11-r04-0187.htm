<p><span class="font0">The Mansard roof (fig. 5) is a useful form of construction which obtains its name from François Mansard, a distinguished&nbsp;French architect who lived in the 17th century. This&nbsp;kind of roof has been largely used, especially in France&nbsp;and other European countries, as well as in America&nbsp;in the old colonial days. It adapts itself well to some styles</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of architecture, but should be very carefully applied, since it I</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">is apt to appear ungainly in some situations. By the use of a Mansard roof extra rooms can be obtained at a small expense&nbsp;without adding an additional storey to the building proper.&nbsp;The outward thrust upon the.supporting walls is not so great&nbsp;as with an ordinary pitched roof, the load coming practically&nbsp;vertically upon them. There is no recognized rule for the&nbsp;proportion or pitch of a roof of this description, which should&nbsp;be designed to suit the particular building it is intended to&nbsp;cover. Fig. 5, A, B, C, D and E show various forms. A similar&nbsp;type of curb roof is often used having a flat lead- or zinc-covered&nbsp;top in place of the pitched slate- or tile-covered top of the&nbsp;ordinary Mansard roof.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Composite roof trusses of wood and iron are frequently used for all classes of buildings, and have proved very satisfactory.&nbsp;They are built upon the same principles as wooden types of&nbsp;roof trusses. The struts—that is, those members subjected&nbsp;to compressional stress—are of wood, and iron bars or rods&nbsp;are used for the ties, which have to withstand tensile forces.&nbsp;When any shrinkage occurs to loosen the joints of the framing,&nbsp;as usually happens in large trusses, the tie-rods are tightened&nbsp;up by the bolts attached to them. Figs. 6, 7 and 8 are the&nbsp;sections and plan of a simple method of constructing the roof&nbsp;for an ordinary domestic building with plaster ceilings to the&nbsp;top rooms. It is a simple construction of the couple close&nbsp;order with the addition of a collar and struts and king-rod&nbsp;to every fourth rafter. Trimming is necessary for openings&nbsp;and where portions of the structure, such as chimney stacks,&nbsp;cut into the roof. The trimming rafters are made an inch&nbsp;thicker than the others. The dragon tic is framed in connexion&nbsp;with the wall-plate at the hipped corners to take the thrust</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of the hip rafters.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Steel and iron trusses in many cases follow the wood models already described. The struts and&nbsp;principal rafters are usually of T section, the&nbsp;tensional members being rods or flat bars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Flat plates and bolts or rivets are used to form the connexions between the members, and a&nbsp;means is provided in the tie-rod for tightening up&nbsp;the truss should any of the members “ give”&nbsp;slightly under their load. Large trusses for very</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">wide spans are specially designed for their work and may be of many different types of design. Big roofs&nbsp;on the tie-rod principle are now being discarded as being&nbsp;more liable to failure, through deterioration or defect, than&nbsp;those built on the girder principle in one form or another.&nbsp;Fig. 9 is a queen-rod roof principal for a span of 50 ft., and&nbsp;shows the sizes of the different members, a line diagram of the&nbsp;truss and large details of the joints. Fig. 10 in a similar&nbsp;manner shows the roof at Cardiff railway station, which has a&nbsp;span of 43 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The steel roof covering the great hall at Olympia, London, is an example of a carefully designed and well-built roof which&nbsp;combines with strength an extremely light and elegant appearance. This is due to the fact that every member of the roof&nbsp;is adapted to meet the particular stresses found by calculation&nbsp;to affect it. By careful study of conditions the sections of&nbsp;steelwork used for the various members have been reduced</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to the smallest size compatible with safety. In this way any unnecessary surplus of material is avoided, and so is the heavy,&nbsp;overwhelming effect noticeable in many roofs of large span.&nbsp;There is an entire absence of long wide plates and webs; the&nbsp;various members* are composed wholly of flat bars and angle&nbsp;irons riveted together, and plates are introduced only where required to cover joints. Some notes on its size and construction</span></p>
