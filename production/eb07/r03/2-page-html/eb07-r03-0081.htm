<p><span class="font1">at all, such as choristers and sacristans, who, strictly speak-' ing, do not belong to the clerical order, but merely discharge the duties of attendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It has been justly remarked, that the members of the religious fraternities are here of more importance, compared with the other clergy, than in the west of Europe, since&nbsp;from them alone are the highest functionaries of the church&nbsp;selected. They are divided into ecclesiastical functionaries of the highest class, such as metropolitans, archbishops,&nbsp;and bishops ; heads of religious bodies, such as archimandrites (abbots), and igumen (priors); and monks. Whoever aims at the honour of being a bishop, &amp;c. must of necessity become a monk. On account of their higher learning and more correct life, the monks are held in much&nbsp;greater estimation than the secular clergy. They live a&nbsp;life of abstinence and strict self-denial. Many of them are&nbsp;men of profound learning and undoubted piety ; but it is&nbsp;to be feared that the greater bulk of the lower orders of&nbsp;ecclesiastics are among the most degraded that ever assumed the priestly habit in Europe. Many of them are as ignorant as the boors with whom they associate, drinking,&nbsp;playing, and going to market with them like unsophisticated&nbsp;serfs. The general state of morals in the Greek Church,&nbsp;compared with those of Protestants in Russia, may be&nbsp;inferred from the tables of births in St Petersburg, published by the holy synod. From these it appears, that out&nbsp;of 8663 births, the number which took place in the year&nbsp;1834, in families of the Greek Church not fewer than 1589&nbsp;were illegitimate ; whilst in the Protestant congregations,&nbsp;of 1031 infants who were baptized, only seventy-six were&nbsp;illegitimate. @@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Catholic Church comprehends eighteen different orders, who possess 113 cloisters, in which there are 2200 monks. They support sixteen circuit and thirty-one parochial schools, at which 3012 scholars receive instruction.&nbsp;There are 666 nuns, belonging to ten different orders, and&nbsp;inhabiting fifty-two nunneries. They support thirty-three female schools, fifteen hospitals for the sick, and twelve poor-houses for the aged and infirm. These educational and&nbsp;benevolent institutions are attached to the cloisters. The&nbsp;Catholic secular priesthood, comprising about two thousand&nbsp;individuals, superintend a number of such establishments.&nbsp;There are in all thirteen seminaries of a higher order, 201&nbsp;parochial schools, with 7688 pupils, and 566 poor-houses,&nbsp;with 4449 inmates. This enumeration is exclusive of Poland, in which, in 1830, there were 1917 clergymen, 309&nbsp;chapels of ease, 2369 secular priests, 156 monasteries with&nbsp;1783 monks, and twenty-nine nunneries with 354 nuns.&nbsp;At the head of the clergy were one archbishop, eight bishops,&nbsp;with a chapter of 276 dignitaries, canons, and the like. The&nbsp;collective number of Catholic ecclesiastics in Russia and&nbsp;Poland is estimated at 10,772.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Protestants, consisting of Lutherans and some other sects, are divided into two synods and eight consistories,&nbsp; to which belong 865 places of devotion. Each of the consistories has a bishop as its president. The Razkolniks or&nbsp;Apostates, that is, dissenters from the Greek Church, do&nbsp;not compose a distinct ecclesiastical body, but exist in separate congregations, independently of one another, and&nbsp;each having some distinctive shade of difference from all&nbsp;the rest. They have a consecrated clergy, but of course&nbsp;no common synod or consistory. Another sect, called the&nbsp;Duchoborzy, differing still more widely from the Greek&nbsp;Church than the former, have taken refuge in the steppes&nbsp;beyond the Don, w’here they still profess their creed, but</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">without the aid of either churches or a priesthood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Mahommedans have 4785 mosques in Russia, of which 2466 are head mosques. They have colleges, mullahs, and muftis, who regulate the religious affairs of the&nbsp;sect.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The worshippers of the Grand Lama have their principal religious establishment at Darsan, in the province of Udinsk. They have a numerous priesthood, who are said&nbsp;to be very successful in making converts amongst the wandering tribes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The principal institution for the dissemination of the Holy Scriptures amongst the various tribes of the empire,&nbsp;in their native languages, is established at St Petersburg,&nbsp;and is in connection with the British and Foreign Bible&nbsp;Society of London. It consists of fifty-eight sections and&nbsp;289 auxiliary societies, situated in Moscow, Jaroslav, Dor-pat, Mittau, Revel, Riga, Orenburg, Tobolsk, Irkutsk, and&nbsp;other places. From the period of its institution in 1813&nbsp;until June 1823, it had issued 184,851 complete Bibles,&nbsp;315,928 New Testaments, and 204,052 Old Testaments,&nbsp;in forty-one different languages and dialects. Its further&nbsp;usefulness was greatly promoted by an arrangement made&nbsp;in 1826, by which the sale of Bibles was for the future permitted. There is always a large supply of Bibles at Moscow, where those condemned to exile in Siberia may have&nbsp;a copy, if they desire one, as they pass through this city on&nbsp;their way to their place of banishment. It is well known&nbsp;that all the exiles, in whatever part of the country they may&nbsp;have received sentence, must take Moscow in their route&nbsp;to Siberia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">As early as the eleventh century, public schools were founded at several places in Russia; but Peter the Great,&nbsp;to whom Russia is indebted for her civilization and present&nbsp;standing, was the first to plan a regular system of public&nbsp;education. Elementary schools were established throughout the country; a naval and engineering school at St&nbsp;Petersburg ; mathematical and navigation schools at Moscow and other places ; ecclesiastical schools in the bishoprics ; and Latin and Greek schools were also founded in&nbsp;different towns of the empire. Shortly after the demise of&nbsp;Peter, the St Petersburg Academy of Sciences was opened;&nbsp;but the military schools were those which throve best under the Empresses Anne and Elizabeth. @@<sup>2</sup> This last sovereign, however, founded in 1755 an university at Moscow,&nbsp;and two years afterwards an academy of the fine arts at&nbsp;St Petersburg. Inferior public schools were not regularly&nbsp;organized until the year 1786, under the reign of the Empress Catherine II. Boarding schools were established by&nbsp;her authority in all the different governments of the empire. But a more important measure was the institution&nbsp;of a central authority, intrusted with the care of disseminating education. This organization underwent a complete reform under the Emperor Alexander, who substituted, for the special commission of the former reign, a minister of public instruction with more extensive powers. This&nbsp;sovereign re-organized the university of Wilna, and founded those of Dorpat, St Petersburg, Kazan, and Kharkov.&nbsp;He also established a gymnasium in the capital of every&nbsp;government, and district schools in every district. But on&nbsp;the accession of Nicholas the system underwent a total&nbsp;change. A few immaterial forms were preserved, but the&nbsp;spirit had departed. His object was to render the system of&nbsp;instruction religious, monarchical, and national; but as the&nbsp;two first terms are evidently auxiliaries of the last, we must&nbsp;fuse the whole into two words, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">strictly national,</span><span class="font1"> a term of&nbsp;profound import, as we shall presently see. Until the year&nbsp;1835, all the civil schools of the empire throughout the se-</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
