a city of the United States, in White- side county, Illinois, on Rock River (a tributary of the Mississippi), 110 miles west of Chicago. Mainly on account of the abundant water-power produced by the natural rapids of the river and a dam 1100 feet long, it has become the seat of the most varied manufacturing industry. An artesian well 1000 feet deep, discharging 18,000 gallons per hour, contributes to the water-supply of the town. The population was 5312 in 1870 and 5087 in 1880. Sterling was laid out in 1836 and incorporated in 1857.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
