The atmo-fpheric preffure is omitted only when the reſiſted plane is at the very furface. D’Ulloa, in his <hi rend="italic">Examino Mori· timo,</hi>  has introduced an equation expreſſing this relation ; but, except with very limited conditions, it will miſiead us prodigiouſly. To give a general notion of its foundation, let AB (ſig. 23.) be the fiction of a plane moving through a fluid in the direction CD, with a known velocity. The fluid will bc heaped up before it above its natural level CD, becaufe the water will not be puſhed before it like a ſolid body, but will be puſh-ed aſide. And it cannot acquire a lateral motion any other way than by an accumulation, which will diffuſe itfilf in all directions by the law of undulatory motion. The water will alſo be left lower behind the plane, becaufe time <hi rend="italic">muβ</hi>  elapſe before-the preffure of the water behind can make it fill the ſpace. We may acquire ſome notion of the extent oſ both the accumulation and depreſſion in this way. There is a certain</p><p>&lt;υ<hi rend="sup">1</hi></p><p>depth CF (= —, where ∙υ is the velocity, and ;· the</p><p>accelerating power of gravity) under the ſurface, fucſh that water would flow through a hole at F with the velocity of the plane’s motion. Draw a horizontal line FG. The water will certainly touch the plane in G, and we may ſuppoſe that it touches it no higher up. Therefore there will be a hollow, fuch as CGE. The elevation HE will be regulated by confiderations nearly fimilar. ED muff be equal to the velocity of the plane, and HE asuſt be its productive height. Thus, if the velocity ¢ff the plane be one foot <hi rend="italic">per</hi>  feeond, HE and EG will be -,⅛of an inch. This is ſnſſicient (though not exact) for giving us a notion of the thing. We fie that from this muſt ariſe a preffure in the direction DC, viz. the preffure of the whole column HG.</p><p>Something of the ſame kind will happen although thc plane AB be wholly immerged, and this even to fome depth, we fie ſuch elevations in a ſwift running ſtream, where there are large ftones at the bottom.— This occafions an excels of preffure in the direction op-poſite to the plane’s motion ; and we ſee that there muſt, in every caſe, be a relation between the velocity and this exceſs of preſſure. This D’Ulloa expreſſes by an equation. But it is very exceptionable, not taking properly into the account the comparative facility with which the water can heap up and diſſuſe itfilf. It muſt always heap up till it acquires a ſuſſicient head of water to produce a lateral and progreſſive diſſufion ſufficient for the purpofe. It is evident, that a ſmaller elevation will ſuſſice when the body is more immerfid, becaufe the check or impulfi given by the body below is propagated, not vertically only, but in every direction ; and therefore the elevation is not confined to that part of the ſurface which is immediately above the moving body, but extends ſo much farther laterally as the centre of agitation is deeper : Thus, the elevation neceſſary for the paſſage of the body is ſo much ſmaller ; and it is the <hi rend="italic">height</hi>  only of this accumulation or wave which de-termines the backward preſſure on the body. D’Ulloa’s equation may happen to quadrate with two experiments at different depths, without being nearly juſt ; for <hi rend="italic">any two</hi>  points may be in a curves without exhibiting its</p><p>equation. Three points will do it with ſome approach to precifion ; but four, at leaſt, are neceſſary for giving any notion of its nature. D’Ulloa has only given two experiments, which we mentioned in another place.</p><p>we may here obſerve, that it is this circumſtance which immediately produces the great reſiſtance to the motion of a body through a fluid in a narrow canal.—. The fluid cannot paſs the body, unleſs the area of thc fiction be ſufficiently extenſive. A narrow canal pre-vents the extenſion ſidewiſe. The water muſt therefore heap up, till the fiction and velocity of diſſuſton are ſuſſiciently enlarged, and thus a great backward preſſure is produced. (See the ficondfiries of Experiments by the French Academicians ; fie alſo Franklin’s Eſſays.) It is important, and will be conſidered in another place,.</p><p>T h us have we attempted to give our readers ſome account of one of the moſt intereſting problems in the whole of mechanical philoſophy. we are ſorry that ſo little advantage can be derived from the united efforts of the .firſt mathematicians of Europe, and that there is ſo little hope of greatly improving our ſcientific knowledge of the ſubjtct. what we have delivered will, however, enable our readers to perufi the writings of thofi who have applied the theories to practical pur-pofis. Such, for inſtance, are the treatifis of John Bernoulli, of Bouguer, and of Euler, on the conſtruc-tion and working of ihips, and the occaſtonal diſſerta-tions of different authors on water-mills. In this laſt application the ordinary theory is not without its value, for the itnpulſes are nearly perpendicular ; in which caſe they do not materially deviate from the duplicate proportion of the fine of incidence. But even here this theory, applied as it commonly is, miileads us exceedingly. The impulſe on one float may be accurately enough ſtated by it ; but the authors have not been attentive to the motion of the water after it has made its impulfi ; and the impulſe on the next float is ſtated the ſame as if the parallel filaments of water, which were not ſtopped by the preceding float, did impinge on the oppofite part of the ficond, in the ſame manner, and with the ſame obliquity and energy, as if it were detached ſrom the reſt. But this does not in the leaſt re-fcmble the real proceſs of nature.</p><p>Suppoſe the floats B, C, D, H (fig. 24.) oſ a wheel immerſed in a ſtream whoſe ſurface moves in the direction AK, and that this ſurface meets the float B in E. The part B E alone is ſuppoſed to be impelled ; whereas the water, checked by the float, heaps up on it to <hi rend="italic">e.—∙ </hi>Then drawing the horizontal line BF, the part CF of the next float is ſuppofid to be all that is impelled by the parallel filaments of the ſtream ; whereas the water bends round the lower edge of the float B by the fur-rounding preſſure, and riles on the float <hi rend="italic">c</hi>  all the way to <hi rend="italic">f.</hi>  In like manner, the float D, inſtead of receiving an impulſe on the very fmall portion D G, is impelled all the way from D to <hi rend="italic">g,</hi>  not much below the lurface of the ſtream. The ſurfaces impelled at once, therefore, greatly exceed what this ſiovenly application of the theory ſuppoſes, and the whole impulſe is much greater; but this is a fault in the application, and not in the theory. It will not be a very difficult thing to acquire a knowledge of the motion of the water which has paſſed the preceding float, which, though not accurate, will yet approximate conſiderably to the truth; and</p><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
