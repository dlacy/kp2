The former occupies the western part of Switzerland, stretching from near the western extremity of the lake of Geneva along the boundary between France and the Pays de Vaud, and then enters the canton of Neuchâtel, which it almost entirely covers, as well as the north-west part of Berne and the greater part of Soleure and Basel, and the north-west part of Aargau. The range of the Jura is divided from the mountains of the Black Forest by the vale of the Rhine ; and its eastern boundary is marked by the lakes of Neuchâtel and Bienne, and the valley of the Lower Aar from the confluence of the Thiele to the junction of the Aar with the Rhine. The Jura consists of several parallel ridges, of which the most eastern is generally the highest. It is precipitous and abrupt towards Switzerland, but becomes gradually lower on the side of France. It does not attain above one third of the height of the Alps, its principal summit in Switzerland being from 5500 to 5300 feet high, but in proportion to its height it is colder than the region of the Alps. The valleys formed by the Jura run parallel with the direction of the chain, are narrow and short, and some of them very elevated and cold. The Jura is principally formed by calcareous rocks of a grayish ash or bluish colour, and in some places mixed with marble.</p><p>The great chain of the Alps forms the highest part of the continent. The main ridge, called the Pennine Alps, forms the boundary between Switzerland and Italy, and separates the basin of the Upper Rhone on the north from that of the Po on thc south. To the south of Mont Blanc the Alps consist of a single chain, with many lateral projections or spurs, chiefly on the west side. Eastward they are divided into two great ranges, which enclose the valley of the Upper Rhone, and meet at Mount St Gothard, which may be regarded as the centre of the Alpine system of Swit- zcrland. Four ranges diverge from this point; the Bernese Alps to the west ; the Alps of Glaris; and the northern Grisons to the north-east; the south-east branch, which forms the southern boundary of the Grisons on the side of Italy ; and the south-west branch, which connects the St Gothard with the Pennine Alps. Between these ranges there are four large valleys, those of the Rhone, the Reuss, the Upper Rhine, and the Ticino. To the north-east of the group of St Gothard is the country of the Grisons, the whole surface of which is studded with elevated ridges and peaks. In this Alpine region there are not less than sixty deep valleys. The mean breadth of the highest portion of the Alps does not exceed 100 miles, but it widens considerably as they proceed eastward. (For an account of these mountain masses, their geology, climate, and natural history, see <hi rend="smallcaps">Alps.)</hi></p><p>North of the Alpine region and east of the Jura lies the table-land of Switzerland, which is the finest and most productive of the whole. It slopes from south to north, from the foot of the Alps to the Rhine and the lake of Constance, and includes thc cantons of Vaud and Freyburg, the greater part of Berne, Lucerne, and Aargau, the whole of Zürich, Zug, Thurgau, and part of St Gall. The elevation of the table-land varies from 1200 to 1800 feet above the sea. Its surface is furrowed by numerous valleys, which generally run from south-east to north-west. Each of these valleys is divided by its river, and various ranges of wooded hills follow the course of the streams.</p><p>The Rhine, the chief river of Switzerland, is formed by the streams which rise in the Alps of the Grisons, and receive the waters of all the glaciers of that lofty region. After leaving the country of the Grisons, it receives on its left bank the Tamina from thc canton of St Gall, and on its right bank the Ill from the Austrian territory. It then flows through or rather forms the lakes of Constance and Untersee. On issuing from the latter, at the town of Stein, it flows in a general west direction, but by a tortuous course, as far as Basel, forming the natural boundary of Switzer</p><p>land on the north side for a direct distance of about seventy miles. By means of the Thur, the Aar, and the Birs, it receives the waters of three fourths of Switzerland. At Basel the Rhine is about 500 feet broad ; here it turns to the north, and soon after leaves the Swiss territory. The Rhone is formed by different streams from Mount Furca, at the north-eastern extremity of the Valais, at the height of 5500 feet above the sea. Descending rapidly to Oberwald, it proceeds in a south-west direction as far as Martigny, where it turns abruptly to the north-west, and continues in that course to its entrance into lake Leman. It issues out of this lake again at Geneva, below which it receives the Arve from the valley of Chamouny, and quits the Swiss territory near Chanci, the last village of the canton of Geneva. The Inn descends from Mount Bermina. The Adda rises from the base of Mount Gallo, and falls into the lake of Como. The Ticino issues from Mount Gries, and traverses the lake Maggiore in Italy. The Aar flows through the lakes of Brientz and Thun, and forms lofty cataracts before its junction with the Rhine. The Limmat, a rapid stream, which rises in the Alpsof Glaris, flows through the lake of Wallerstadt : after marking the limits between the Schwytz and St Gall it forms the lake of Zürich, and, flowing through part of the cantons of Zürich and Aargau, enters the Aar below the confluence of the Reuss. The Thur rises in the mountains of High Toggenburg, in the canton of St Gall, and enters the Rhine below Rheinau.</p><p>The Leman lake, or lake of Geneva, the great reservoir of the Rhone, spreads in the form of a crescent, its northern bank being about fifty-four miles in length, and its southern bank about forty-six. Its breadth near the middle is about nine miles, but it becomes much narrower towards Geneva. The surface of the lake is 1200 feet above the level of the sea. Its greatest depth is about 1800 feet, and its area 340 square miles. It receives several streams, the principal of which are the Dranse from the Alps of Savoy, and the Vevayse and Venoge from the Swiss side. Lake Leman is known to have been frozen over only twice, in <hi rend="smallcaps">a. d</hi>. 762 and 805. The lake of Constance, or Boden See, is about forty-five miles long and ten miles wide. Its area is about 290 square miles, and its greatest depth is 1800 feet. One or two steam-boats run upon the lake of Constance. The Waldstätten See, or lake of the four cantons, is about twenty-six miles in length. The southern part of it, called the lake of Uri, is a sheet of deep water, eight miles long and between one and two broad, running from south to north between two ranges of mountains almost perpendicular ; a narrow channel unites it with the middle basin, which is about nine miles in length and about two wide. Another narrow strait leads from the middle into the western basin, called the lake of Lucerne, which is the widest and finest of the three. The lake is about 1400 feet above the level of the sea, and its greatest depth is 1000 feet. The country around the Waldstätten See is the cradle of Swiss independence, and is full of recollections of the exploits of its heroes. A steam-boat plies between Lucerne and Fluellen, the port of Altorf. The lake of Zurich, formed by the Limmat, is twenty-four miles long, and from one mile to two miles wide. Its greatest depth is 600 feet, and its surface is about 1300 feet above the level of the sea. A steam-boat plies on this lake between Zürich and Rapperswyl. The lake of Neuchâtel is about twenty-five miles in length, and five miles broad throughout one half of its length. It is about 1400 feet above the sea, and its greatest depth is about 350 feet. A steam-boat plies daily on this lake. Besides these there are several other lakes of considerable dimensions, such as the lake of Wallerstadt, formed by the Limmat, eleven miles in length, and the lakes of Brientz and Thun, both formed by the Aar; the latter thirteen miles long, its greatest depth 800 feet, and more than 1900</p></body></text></TEI>
