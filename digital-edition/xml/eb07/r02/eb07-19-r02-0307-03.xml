<p><label>ROCHDALE</label>
a market-town of the county of Lancaster, in the hundred of Salford, 197 miles from London and twelve from Manchester. It is situated in a fine valley on the river Roche, and is overlooked by the church, which stands on an eminence ascended by 118 steps. The hills around it abound in excellent coal. The chief occupation is the manufacture of flannels and other woollen goods. The parish is large, and contains twelve townships, two of which are in the west riding of Yorkshire. The population of the ten in Lancashire amounted in 1801 to 29,954, in 1811 to 45,227, in 1821 to 48,112, and in 1831 to 58,441 ; that of the Yorkshire part amounted in 1831 to 15,997. By the parliamentary reform bill this town has received the privilege of electing one member to the House of Commons, but it has no municipal corporation.</p>
