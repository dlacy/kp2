<p><span class="font1">slightly since their first appearance. The marine turtles seem to have first acquired elongated paddles and vacuities in the&nbsp;shell during the Cretaceous period, and the Trionychia, destitute&nbsp;of epidermal shields, apparently arose at the same time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">genera, and the neck is usually elongated though not flexible. The tail is insignificant, generally short, and both pairs of&nbsp;paddles seem to have been concerned in progression.

<p><span class="font1">Anomodontia, and the shape of the scapula seems to show some connexion with the Chelonia. The truly aquatic Sauropter-ygians of the Jurassic (fig. 4) and Cretaceousperiods possess most</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">effective paddles with elongated digits, and as the genera are traced upwards in the geological formations it is possible to&nbsp;observe how .the arches supporting the limbs become more rigid&nbsp;until the maximum of strength is reached. A few genera, such&nbsp;as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pliosaurus</span><span class="font1"> from the Jurassic and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Polyptychodon</span><span class="font1"> from the&nbsp;Cretaceous of Europe, are distinguished by their relatively large&nbsp;head and stout neck. Some of the largest Upper Jurassic and&nbsp;Cretaceous species must have been 10 metres in length. They&nbsp;were cosmopolitan in their distribution, but became extinct&nbsp;before the dawn of the Tertiary period.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Order 4. </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ichthyopterygia.</span><span class="font1">—The Ichthyosaurians are all fish-shaped, with a relatively large head and very short neck.&nbsp;Both pairs of paddles are retained, but the hinder pair is usually&nbsp;very small, and locomotion seems to have been chiefly effected&nbsp;by a large caudal fin. This fin, as shown in impression by certain&nbsp;fossils from Württemberg and Bavaria, is a vertical, triangular,&nbsp;dermal expansion, without any skeletal support except the&nbsp;hindermost part of the attenuated vertebral column, which&nbsp;extends along the border of its lower lobe (fig. 5). Another&nbsp;triangular fin, without skeletal support, is known to occur on the&nbsp;back, at least in one species (fig. 5). Some of the genera are&nbsp;proved to have been viviparous.· Like the Sauropterygia, the&nbsp;Ichthyopterygia appear to have originated from terrestrial&nbsp;ancestors, for their earliest Triassic representatives </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Mixosaurus)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">have the teeth less uniform and the limbs slightly less paddleshaped than the latter genera. In this connexion it is noteworthy&nbsp;that their hollow conical teeth exhibit curious infoldings of the&nbsp;wall, like those observed in many Labyrinthodonts, while their&nbsp;short, biconcave vertebrae almost exactly resemble those of&nbsp;the Labyrinlhodont </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Maslodonsaurus</span><span class="font1"> and its&nbsp;allies. As the Ichthyosaurs are traced upwards in geological time, some genera become&nbsp;almost, or quite, toothless, while the paddles&nbsp;grow wider, and are rendered more flexible&nbsp;by the persistence of cartilage round their&nbsp;constituent bones </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Ophlhalmosaurus),</span><span class="font1"> They&nbsp;were cosmopolitan in distribution, but disappeared from all seas at the close of the&nbsp;Cretaceous period.
