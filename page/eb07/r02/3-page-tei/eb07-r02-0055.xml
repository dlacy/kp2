At Petersburg he could have lived without regretting his country, in the society of such men as Euler and Alpinus, admired by the Russians, and beloved by the British ; but Cronstadt in winter was deplorably melancholy ; and in 1773 he was induced, without much difficulty, to makc some little pecuniary sacrifice in accepting the professorship of natural philosophy at Edinburgh, which had become vacant by the death of Dr Russell, and to which he had been recommended by Dr Robertson, then principal of the university. His determination was not disapproved by the Russian government, who granted him a pension of about L.80 a year for life ; but it was only paid as long as three or four young men, who had accompanied him as pupils, continued to reside at Edinburgh ; some discontent having been expressed because he did not keep up a correspondence with the academy on the improvement of maritime education.</p><p>He arrived at Edinburgh in September 1774. He married soon afterwards, and continued to reside in that city for the remaining thirty years of his life, paying only an annual visit to his native place, where he possessed a part of the paternal estate ; not being solicitous to extend it, although “ he did not diminish it otherwise than as it had been diminished before,” that is, in making provision for younger children. His predecessor had been very judicious and successful as a lecturer, though not a mathematician of the highest order : he had himself more practical knowledge and experience in mechanics, and was better acquainted with the foreign mathematicians, who had naturally fallen under his notice during his residence on the continent. His lectures were considered by most of his pupils as somewhat too difficult to be followed ; a complaint which, if it did not depend on their own want of preparatory information, arose perhaps rather more from the hasty manner of his enunciation than from the abstruseness of his matter. “ The singular facility of his own apprehension,” says Professor Playfair, “ made him judge too favourably of the same power in others. To understand his lectures completely was, on account of the rapidity and the uniform flow of his discourse, not a very easy task, even for men tolerably familiar with the subject. On this account his lectures were less popular than might have been expected from such a combination of talents as the author of them possessed.” This inconvenience was increased “ by the small number of experiments he introduced, and a view that he took of natural philosophy, which left but a very subordinate place for them to occupy. An experiment, he would very truly observe, does not establish a general proposition, and never can do more than prove a particular fact ;” but he seems to have carried this principle to some little excess : it is, in fact, the <hi rend="italic">illustration,</hi>  and not the <hi rend="italic">proof,</hi>  of general principles that is the object of a public exhibition of experiments ; and it is very doubtful whether Archimedes, or Newton, or Leibnitz, or Euler, would have been very successfid as <hi rend="italic">showmen.</hi>  With respect, however, to “ accuracy of definition, to clearness, brevity, and elegance of demonstration, and even to neatness and precision in experiments,” Professor Robison was very successful ; his course extended “ to every branch of physics and of mixed mathematics,” and entered so fully into the detail of each particular division of the subjects, that “ a more perfect system of academical instruction is not easily to be imagined.” Nothing, in short, was wanting, but so much previous knowledge of mathematics in his pupils as he thought he had a right to expect, though his expectations were too rarely fulfilled.</p><p>The Philosophical Society of Edinburgh had almost been suffercd to sink into oblivion after the publication of the third volume of its Essays, in 1756. Professor Robison became a member of it soon after his return from Russia, and was chosen secretary of the new society upon its formation by royal charter in 1783, when it incorporated with itself the whole of the surviving members of the former society. In 1798 he received the compliment of a degree of Doctor of Laws from the university of New Jersey ; and a similar honour was paid him at Glasgow the year after. In 1800 he was elected, as successor to Dr Black, on the list of the foreign members of the Royal Academy of Sciences of St Petersburg.</p><p>In 1785 he was attacked by a severe disorder, from which he was never afterwards wholly free, though it produced little inconvenience besides pain, with some depression of spirits, which was, however, attributed rather to the closeness of his application than to the immediate effect of the disease, which was a glandular induration. For many years he was obliged to obtain the assistance of substitutes in the delivery of his lectures ; but towards the end of his life he w<hi rend="sup">,</hi>as able again to perform the duties of the professorship in person. He continued his literary labours with little intermission, and was most happy in the care and attention of his wife and children, whose virtues he found the best alleviation of his sufferings. He took a slight cold, after giving a lecture, on the 28th of January 1805, and died on the 30th.</p><p>1.    It was comparatively late in life that Professor Robison assumed the character of an author, having communicated to the Royal Society of Edinburgh, in 1786, a paper on the Determination of the Orbit and Motion of the Geor-gium Sidus, which was published in the Edinburgh Transactions, vol. i. He had observed - the opposition of the planet with an equatorial telescope only, and he had computed the elements of its orbit with greater accuracy than any other astronomer had then done ; although his suspicion of the effect of such a planet on the motions of Jupiter and Saturn has not been confirmed by later investigations, the irregularities of these planets, on the contrary, having been otherwise explained.</p><p>2.    A second paper, published in the same collection, vol. ii. p. 82, relates to the Motion of Light, as affected by refracting or reflecting substances which are themselves in motion. The author corrects some errors of Boscovich, who had miscalculated the effect of a water-telescope ; but he seems to agree with Dr Wilson in the suggestion of another experiment of a similar nature, which, to say the least, is wholly superfluous.</p><p>3.    The most important, beyond all comparison, of Professor Robison’s scientific publications, are the articles which he communicated from time to time to the third edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, and to its Supplement. It was under the care of Mr Colin Macfarquhar that the first twelve volumes of that edition of this work were published;@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi> and upon his death, in 1793, the task of continuing it was committed to Dr Gleig, to whom Professor Robison became a most essential co-operator, and from that time “ the work ceased to be a mere compilation.” The first of his contributions, according to Professor Playfair, was the article Optics, but it is probable he only revised and enlarged that article: it was followed by Philosophy, which he wrote jointly with Dr Gleig; by Physics, Pneumatics, Precession, Projectiles, Pumps, Resistance, Rivers, Roof, Rope-making, Rotation, Seamanship, Signal, Sound, Specific Gravity, Statics, Steam, Steam-Engine, Steelyard, Strength,Telescope,Tide, Trumpet, Variation, and Water-works; and in the</p><p>@@@<hi rend="sup">1</hi>  The third edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica consisted of eighteen volumes ; the Supplement to it of two volume».</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
