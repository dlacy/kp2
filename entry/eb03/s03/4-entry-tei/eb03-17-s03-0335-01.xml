in natural hiſtory, a ſpecies of <hi rend="smallcaps">Schistus.</hi> It is a black ſlaty ſubſtance, or a clay hardened into a ſtony conſiſtence, and ſo much impregnated with bitumen that it becomes ſomewhat like a coal. The acid emitted from ſhale, during its calcination, uniting itſelf to the argillaceous earth of the ſhale, forms alum. About 120 tons of calcined ſhale will make one ton of alum. The ſhale, after being calcined, is ſteeped in water, by which means the alum, which is formed during the calcination oſ the ſhale, is diſſolved : this diſſolved alum undergoes various operations before it is formed into the alum of the ſhops. Watſon’s Chemical Eſſays, vol. ii. p. 315. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Alum.</hi></p><p>This kind of ſlate forms large ſtrata in Derbyſhire ; and that which lies near the ſurface of the earth is of a ſofter and more ſhivery texture than that which lies deeper. It is alſo found in large ſtrata, generally above the coal, in moſt coal counties of this kingdom. Dr Short informs us, that the ſhale waſtes the lead ore near it, by its ſtrong acid ; and that it corrodes and deſtroys all minerals near it except iron or coal, of whoſe vitriol it partakes.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
