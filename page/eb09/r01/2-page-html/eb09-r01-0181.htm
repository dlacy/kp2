<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">We conclude with a few remarks on the history and spread of religions. Between the history of religions and&nbsp;that of religion in general there is no real difference. A&nbsp;history of religions must be something other and more&nbsp;than a collection of the histories of the principal religions,&nbsp;arranged after a chronological or an ethnological scheme.&nbsp;The connecting links and historical relations between them&nbsp;must be kept in view. It ought to be shown how every&nbsp;religion coming to the front on the stage of history is&nbsp;rooted in the past, has been fostered so to speak by one&nbsp;or more of its predecessors, and cannot be maintained&nbsp;without taking up and assimilating the still living&nbsp;elements of the old faith. Special attention must be paid&nbsp;to the spread and intermixture of religions and systems,&nbsp;myths and rites, the cause of so many changes, of thorough&nbsp;reforms as well as of corruption and decay. Thus, even&nbsp;undesignedly the history of religions exhibits the progress&nbsp;of the religious idea in the history of mankind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">The oldest historical documents, contemporaneous with the facts they record, are undoubtedly those of ancient&nbsp;Egypt aud Babylonia; perhaps the latter may in the end&nbsp;prove the more ancient of the two. Be this as it may,&nbsp;documentary history begins in western Asia and northeastern Africa. And it is remarkable that even in that&nbsp;remote past we find the religions both of ancient Babylonia&nbsp;and of Egypt in anything but a primitive state—remarkable, but only natural, as civilization must have reached a&nbsp;rather elevated standpoint to produce such written documents and works of art. Many centuries, at all events a&nbsp;long period, of religious evolution must have preceded the&nbsp;dawn of religious history. Even then and there, just as&nbsp;elsewhere, that which lies behind can only be conjectured,&nbsp;but conjecture may be raised to a high degree of&nbsp;probability by comparing the myths and rites surviving&nbsp;in the historical religions, though they really belong to a&nbsp;former state of development, with those still prevailing&nbsp;among uncivilized tribes. Eor several centuries these two&nbsp;religions, whatever may have been their genealogical&nbsp;relation, were developed independently, and the task of&nbsp;the historian is, by studying the most ancient records, to&nbsp;give a notion of their earliest state and to point out the&nbsp;faint traces of their internal changes which are still&nbsp;extant. There are some vague allusions to an early&nbsp;Babylonian conquest of western Asia, which might account&nbsp;for the agreement of some ancient modes of worship in the&nbsp;Western countries with those of Babylonia; but before the&nbsp;XYIIIth Dynasty of Egypt (15th or 16th century </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.) </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the&nbsp;empires on the banks of the Euphrates and Tigris and&nbsp;that on the banks of the Nile seem not yet to have come&nbsp;into contact. From that time, at least during the rule&nbsp;of the XIXth Dynasty, not a few Semitic deities were&nbsp;admitted into the Egyptian pantheon. In a well-known&nbsp;hymn the victorious Egyptian king is compared to the</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Semitic Ba'al as well as to the national god Mentu. On the other hand, but much later, some Egyptian religious&nbsp;emblems find their way into Assyria, and several Egyptian&nbsp;gods with Egyptian modes of worship into Phoenicia.&nbsp;Assyrian religion, bping an early offshoot of the Babylonian,&nbsp;and with the lapse of time more and more imbued with&nbsp;younger Babylonian elements, spreads westwards with&nbsp;the extension of the Assyrian empire, penetrates into&nbsp;Asia Minor and Syria, and finds followers even among the&nbsp;kings of Judah. But there the prophets, true to their&nbsp;national god Jahveh, and reforming his worship on purely&nbsp;ethical principles, wrestle with unbending perseverance&nbsp;against those foreign idolatrous customs and lay the&nbsp;foundations of that monotheistic community which survives the Babylonian exile, and, having been organized as&nbsp;Judaism, becomes the cradle of Christianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Did space permit we would fain pursue the rapid historical sketch, which tends to show how even in&nbsp;ancient times there was a continuous interchange of ideas&nbsp;and rites between the leading religions, those even which&nbsp;are commonly considered as being purely national—that is,&nbsp;so entirely fused with the social and political life of a&nbsp;nation that they seem unfit for adoption by peoples&nbsp;widely different. But a general survey of the history of&nbsp;religions cannot be given here. All that can be done is&nbsp;to indicate in a few words its further course, not without&nbsp;hinting that the same interchange as we have observed in&nbsp;western Asia and Egypt is to be found everywhere.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">In eastern Asia the dominating religions are those of China and of India. They too have been developed independently, each radiating from its centre, China proper&nbsp;and Hindustan, so far as either the vast Chinese empire&nbsp;or the Aryan dominion over the Indian peninsula extended.&nbsp;The Chinese civilization seems to be much older than the&nbsp;Indian. But the sources from which a knowledge of the&nbsp;ancient Chinese religion might be drawn have come down&nbsp;to us thoroughly revised and expurgated either by Confucius himself or by some of his followers. The ancient&nbsp;religious literature of India is very extensive, and in it&nbsp;three or four stages of religious thought may without&nbsp;difficulty be found; but the real ancient history of Indian&nbsp;religion is not to be gathered from it. Neither Chinese nor&nbsp;Indian religions have exercised any influence on the progress of religion in the west of Asia or in Europe. They&nbsp;form a world apart. The Chinese religion was adopted by&nbsp;some Mongolian tribes and was introduced into Corea and&nbsp;Japan; Indian settlers, Vaishnavas, Qaivas, or Bauddhas,&nbsp;carried Indian thought and Indian worship with them to&nbsp;some parts of Further India and of the Indian archipelago,&nbsp;but this happened in relatively recent times. For ages&nbsp;and ages they lived quite isolated and self-sufficient—the&nbsp;Chinese either with Lao-tsze seeking the veritable Tao in&nbsp;the highest ideal of absolute isolation, or with Confucius&nbsp;amiably moralizing on the duties of “the perfect man”;&nbsp;the Indian dreaming his monotonous and fantastic dreams&nbsp;and longing for absorption in the eternal Brahm; neither&nbsp;of them suspecting that without them, among what they&nbsp;would have called Western barbarians if they had known&nbsp;of their existence, the world’s history was going on as a&nbsp;mighty stream of which they did not even hear the distant&nbsp;roar. It was not until Darius the son of Hystaspes, but&nbsp;chiefly Alexander the Great, had opened the gates of India&nbsp;to Western civilization that an Indian sovereign, converted&nbsp;to Buddhism, could think of benefiting foreign nations by&nbsp;the message of salvation from the miseries of existence,&nbsp;and that Buddhist missionaries went ouf to nearly every&nbsp;part of Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Meanwhile Medo-Persian supremacy had supplanted the Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian, and with it the Zarathus-trian religion (Mazdaism) had come in contact with those</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
