        <p><span class="font1">whole power and influence of the new nobility.@@<sup>1</sup> These “
                nobiles ” are essentially distinct from the older and more&nbsp;legitimate patrician
                aristocracy. Every patrician was of&nbsp;course noble, but the majority of the “
                noble families ” in&nbsp;146 were not patrician but plebeian.@@<sup>2</sup> The
                title had been&nbsp;gradually appropriated, since the opening of the magistracies,
                by those families whose members had held curule&nbsp;office, and had thereby
                acquired the “jus imaginum.” It&nbsp;was thus in theory within the reach of any
                citizen who&nbsp;could win election even to the curule ædileship, and, moreover, it
                carried with it no legal privileges whatsoever.&nbsp;Gradually, however, the
                ennobled plebeian families drew&nbsp;together, and combined with the older patrician
                gentes to&nbsp;form a distinct order. Office brought wealth and prestige,&nbsp;and
                both wealth and prestige were liberally employed in&nbsp;securing for this select
                circle a monopoly of political&nbsp;power, and excluding new men.@@<sup>3</sup>
                Already by the close oι&nbsp;the period it is rare for any one but a noble to find
                his&nbsp;way into high office or into the senate. The senate and&nbsp;magistrates
                are the mouthpieces of this order, and are&nbsp;identified with it in policy and
                interest. Lastly, it must&nbsp;be allowed that both the senate and the nobility had
                to&nbsp;some extent justified their power by the use they made of&nbsp;it. It was
                their tenacity of purpose and devoted patriotism which had carried Rome through the
                dark days of&nbsp;the Hannibalic war. The heroes of the struggle with&nbsp;Carthage
                belonged to the leading families ; the disasters at&nbsp;the Trasimene Lake and at
                Cannæ were associated with&nbsp;the blunders of popular favourites.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">From the first however, there was an inherent weakness in this
                senatorial government. It had no sound constitutional basis, and with the removal of
                its accidental supports it fell to the ground. Legally the senate had
                no&nbsp;positive authority. It could merely advise the magistrate&nbsp;when asked to
                do so, and its decrees were strictly only&nbsp;suggestions to the magistrate, which
                he was at liberty to&nbsp;accept or reject as he chose.@@<sup>4</sup> It had it is
                true become&nbsp;customary for the magistrate not only to ask the
                senate’s&nbsp;advice on all important points, but to follow it when given.&nbsp;But
                it was obvious that if this custom were weakened,&nbsp;and the magistrates chose to
                act independently, the senate&nbsp;was powerless. It might indeed
                    anathematize@@<sup>5</sup> the refractory official, or hamper him if it could by
                setting in&nbsp;motion against him a colleague or the tribunes, but it&nbsp;could do
                no more, and these measures, though as a rule&nbsp;effective in the case of
                magistrates stationed in Rome,&nbsp;failed just where the senate’s control was most
                needed and&nbsp;most difficult to maintain—in its relations with the
                generals&nbsp;and governors of provinces abroad. The virtual independence of the
                proconsul was before 146 already exciting the&nbsp;jealousy of the senate and
                endangering its supremacy.@@<sup>6&nbsp;</sup>Nor again had the senate any legal
                hold over the assembly.&nbsp;Except in certain specified cases, it rested with the
                magistrate to decide whether any question should be settled by&nbsp;a decree of the
                senate or a vote of the assembly.@@<sup>7</sup> If he</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">decided to make a proposal to the assembly, he was not bound except
                by custom to obtain the previous approval&nbsp;of the senate, and @@<sup>8 </sup>the
                constitution set no limits to the&nbsp;power of the assembly to decide any question
                whatsoever&nbsp;that was laid before it. The right of the people to govern&nbsp;was
                still valid, and though it Iiad long lain dormant any&nbsp;year might see a
                magistrate in office resolved on recalling&nbsp;the people to a larger share in the
                conduct of affairs by&nbsp;consulting them rather than the senate, and an
                assembly&nbsp;bent on the exercise of its lawful prerogatives.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">And from 167 at least, onwards, there were increasing indications
                that both the acquiescence of the people and&nbsp;the loyalty of the magistrates
                were failing. The absorbing excitement of the great wars had died away;
                the&nbsp;economic and social disturbance and distress which they&nbsp;produced were
                creating a growing feeling of discontent;&nbsp;and at the same time the senate
                provoked inquiries into&nbsp;its title to govern by its failure any longer to govern
                well.&nbsp;In the East there was growing confusion ; in the West a&nbsp;single
                native chieftain defied the power which had crushed&nbsp;Carthage. At home the
                senate was becoming more and&nbsp;more simply an organ of the nobility, and the
                nobility&nbsp;were becoming every year more exclusive, more selfish,&nbsp;and less
                capable and unanimous.@@<sup>9</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">But if the senate was not to govern, the difficulty arose of finding
                an efficient substitute, and it was this difficulty&nbsp;that mainly determined the
                issue of the struggles which&nbsp;convulsed Rome from 133 to 49. As the event
                showed,&nbsp;neither the assembly nor the numerous and disorganized&nbsp;magistracy
                were equal to the work ; the latter were gradually pushed aside in favour of a more
                centralized authority,&nbsp;and the former became only the means by which this
                new&nbsp;authority was first encouraged in opposition to the.senate&nbsp;and finally
                established in a position of impregnable&nbsp;strength. The assembly which made
                Pompey and Cæsar&nbsp;found out too late that it could not unmake them.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">It is possible that these constitutional and administrative
                difficulties would not have proved so rapidly fatal to the republic had not its very
                foundations been sapped&nbsp;by the changes which followed more or less directly
                on&nbsp;the conquest of the world. These changes can only be&nbsp;glanced at here.
                Civic equality and solidarity were alike&nbsp;destroyed by the concentration of
                wealth in a few hands,&nbsp;the disappearance of the small independent
                freeholder,&nbsp;and the growing numbers of freedmen and clients. The&nbsp;Roman
                community became not only unmanageably large,&nbsp;but hopelessly divided by class
                distinctions and interests,&nbsp;and wide differences in habits of life and modes
                of&nbsp;thought. The old traditions, beliefs, and usages inseparably connected with
                the republican regime, and essential&nbsp;to its continuance, lost ground daily
                before the incoming&nbsp;flood of new fashions, intellectual and social, from
                Greece&nbsp;and the East. Before the republic fell, Roman society&nbsp;was already
                in structure, temper, and mind thoroughly&nbsp;un republican.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The first systematic attack upon the senatorial government is
                connected with the names of Tiberius and Gaius Gracchus, and its immediate occasion
                was an attempt to&nbsp;deal with no less a danger than the threatened disappearance
                of the class to which of all others Rome owed most</span></p>
