It was conquered by a general dispatched for this purpose by a lieutenant of the Ommade Caliph Walid in Sejestim and Candahar; and flourished under the vicegerents of the prophet till its conquest by the Sultan of Ghizni. It afterwards came under the jurisdiction of the Soomrai, a native tribe, and was again reduced by Mahommed Ghori, and annexed as a fief to the crown of Delhi, to which it remained attached for two centuries. In the various conquests and revolutions which subsequently took place in India, this country was the prize of the victor. It was finally subdued by the armies of Acbar about the year 1580, since which period its rulers have never ventured openly to avow their independence, though they have sometimes evaded the payment of the tribute fixed, and have even frequently appeared in arms against the lord paramount. Under the succeeding emperors the province of Sinde was kept under strict subjection, though the unsettled aspect of Hindustan sometimes encouraged the rulers of Sinde to withhold the tribute. In the mean time the introduction of vast tribes of Beloches as mercenaries, had changed the character of the population, and the rule of the family of Toor Khan had given place to the tribe of Caloras, sprung, it is supposed, from adventurers that followed the Persian army. The invasion of India by Nadir Shah in 1739, extended the rule of Persia over Sinde and all the provinces west of the Indus ; but his assassination paved the way for the rise of the D∞ranee empire under Ahmed Khan Seedozy, who declared himself king of Cabul, to whom Sinde after a time submitted, and has ever since been considered subordinate, though frequently rebelling and refusing to pay tribute. The country was long a scene of civil dissension, different competitors contending for tire throne, the Talpoories, a tribe of Beloche origin, rebelling against the house of Calora. Their contentions were car- ried on with various success, and with ruin and misery to the country, which was wasted in these wars. Ahmed Shah, the conquerer of the Mahrattas in the battle of Panripart in 1761, exacted the tribute with all its arrears. In 1786, Meer Futteh Allee, the eldest of four brothers, was confirmed as ruler of the country. He admitted to a par- ticipation in his high destiny his three younger brothers, Ghoulam Ali, Kurm Ali, and Mourad Ali ; and they agreed to reign together as the ameers or the lords of Sinde. Futteh Allee died in 1801, and Ghoulam Ali in 1811 ; and the coun- try, as has been already mentioned, is now partitioned be- tween the surviving brothers, and their respective sons.</p><p>It is scarcely possible that this outlying country of Sinde can remain long independent of British control. The late great and successful expedition, for the purpose of restor- ing Dost Mahommed to the throne of Cabul, however ques- tionable its policy, has extended the power of the British in India into countries where their name was scarcely known before. All the intervening states through whose territories the army passed in its progress to the scene of action, viewed the mighty movement with a mixed feeling of jealousy and awe. Having seen the various states of India, its princes and chiefs, with their dependent tributaries, successively swallowed up in the wide extending sway of this European empire, they would willingly have joined in repelling its further advances into the interior of Asia ; but they were overawed ; and the late brilliant operations of the British will tend to confirm and extend their political influence, and will in the end bring all such petty states as Sinde, alternately the prey of despotism and anarchy, under the control or the direct supremacy of that great power, whose mighty empire in the east, reared up by a continued train of brilliant success for more than half a century, seems only a step in her farther progress to the dominion of Asia.</p><p>SINDE <hi rend="italic">River,</hi> in Hindustan, has its rise in the high table land of the Malwah province to the west of Seronge ; and after a winding course, falls into the Jumna six miles to the north of Calpee.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Sinde Sagor,</hi> a district of Hindustan in the province of Lahore, situated principally between the 31st and 32d degrees of north latitude.

The island of Singapore is situated at the extremity of the peninsula, in the straits of Singapore, through which lies the route of vessels to and from the China seas. The town stands in lat. 1. 17. 22. N., long. 103. 51. 45. E., on a point of land near the western part of a bay, and is easily distinguished by a pleasant hill behind it, mostly cleared of trees, which abound on the island. This was the situation chosen by Sir Stamford Raffles for establishing a settlement under the protection of Britain, which might, in some degree, command the free naviga- tion of the Straits of Malacca. He accordingly sailed from Calcutta for this purpose in the latter end of the year 1818, and in 1819 he hoisted the British flag, with a population of not more than 200 souls. In three months, according to the official letter of Sir Stamford Raffles, the number had increased to 3000 ; and at the date of the letter, April 1820, to 10,000, principally Chinese. Not less than 173 sail of vessels, of different descriptions, principally native, arrived and sailed in the course of the first two months, and in a short time it had grown up into an important commercial port. The rapid rise of this important station, is, perhaps, unequalled in the history of any other country, and marks the sagacity with which so central a situation was chosen, with respect to India and China, from the lat- ter of which it is distant only five days’ sail ; in regard also to Java, the great islands of Borneo and Sumatra, and the Eastern Archipelago. Its natural advantages are great. It is placed on a rich soil, with fertile tracts of land in the neighbourhood, which give ample scope to agricultural ira- provement; and this, combined with the freedom from im- posts, and the security for life and property, under a mild and enlightened government, are the circumstances which have attracted these industrious settlers, who, descrying from afar the ensign of freedom and justice, fly to it for protection from the tyranny and extortion of their own native rulers. The island of Singapore, which has been surveyed since the British settlement was established, is about twenty-seven miles in its greatest length, and fifteen in its greatest breadth. It is estimated to contain an area of 270 square miles; is diversified with hill and dale, and is adapted to the growth of numerous and valuable commodi-</p></body></text></TEI>
