<p><span class="font1">5. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Transition lo Monotheism.—From</span><span class="font1"> the higher Polytheism an easy step leads to some form of Monotheism. The transition&nbsp;may be effected in various ways. Max Müller observed the&nbsp;Vedic poets addressing themselves to the several objects of&nbsp;their devotion, as if each occupied the field alone. Varuna or&nbsp;Indra was for the time being the only god within the worshipper’s&nbsp;view; and to this mode of thought he gave the name Heno-theism.@@<sup>1</sup> It obviously reappears elsewhere, as it is the natural&nbsp;attitude of prayer, and may be seen in the pious homage of&nbsp;the pilgrims to the Virgin of Loretto or Einsiedeln. Pfleiderer&nbsp;employed the word to denote a relative monotheism like that&nbsp;of the early religion of Israel, whose teachers demanded that&nbsp;the nation should worship but one god, Yahweh, but did not&nbsp;deny the existence of other gods for other peoples. Yet once&nbsp;again the term has been applied to characterize a whole group&nbsp;of religions, like the Indo-Germanic, which are ultimately&nbsp;founded on the unity of the divine nature in a plurality of&nbsp;divine persons. A designation of such doubtful meaning it&nbsp;seems better (with Chantepie de la Saussaye) to abandon. But&nbsp;the unifying process may advance along different lines. The&nbsp;deities of different local centres may be identified; many such&nbsp;combinations took place in Egypt, and Isis in late days served&nbsp;to her votaries as the unitary principle which appeared in one&nbsp;figure after another of whole pantheons. Again, the gods may&nbsp;be viewed as a collective totality, like the “ All-gods ” of the&nbsp;Vedic poets, or as at Olympia where there was a “ common&nbsp;altar for all the gods” (cf. the frequent Roman dedication in&nbsp;later days, “ Jovi optimo maximo caeterisque dis immortalibus ”).&nbsp;Or the relation between the inferior deities and the most exalted&nbsp;may be conceived politically and explained by Tertullian’s&nbsp;formula, “ Imperium penes unum, officia penes multos.” One&nbsp;particular god may be eminent enough, like Zeus, to rise above&nbsp;all others, and supply cultivated thought with a name for the&nbsp;supreme power; and this may be strengthened by the national&nbsp;motive as in the case of Israel. Or philosophic theology may&nbsp;penetrate to an abstract conception of deity, like the Babylonian&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">'iluth,</span><span class="font1"> or the Vedic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">devatva</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asuratva',</span><span class="font1"> and some seer may&nbsp;have the courage and insight to formulate the principle that&nbsp;“ the great </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">asuratva</span><span class="font1"> of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">devas</span><span class="font1"> is one ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(R.V.</span><span class="font1"> iii. 55. 1). “ The&nbsp;One with many names ” was recognized alike in India and in&nbsp;Greece; “πολλών </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ονομάτων μορφή μία,”</span><span class="font1"> says Aeschylus, almost&nbsp;in the words of the Vedic poet.@@<sup>2</sup> Historians have usually&nbsp;recognized only three monotheistic religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam. The Christian apologists of the 2nd&nbsp;century, however, found plenty of testimony to their doctrine&nbsp;of the unity of God in the writings of Greek poets and philosophers; it was a commonplace in the revival under the&nbsp;Empire; and among the group of religions embraced under the&nbsp;name Buddhism more than one form must be ranked as monotheistic. The idealist philosophy of the Prajna Päramitä in the&nbsp;system of the “ Great Vehicle ” declared that “ every phenomenon is the manifestation of mind ” (Beal, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Catena,</span><span class="font1"> p. 303).&nbsp;In the “ Lotus of the Good Law ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(S.B.E.</span><span class="font1"> xxi.) the Buddha is&nbsp;the “ Father of the World,” “ Self-born ” or Uncreate (like the&nbsp;eternal Brahmä of the Hindu theology), the protector of all&nbsp;creatures, the Healer (Saviour) of the sickness of their sins.&nbsp;These types have reappeared in Japan. Nichiren taught a&nbsp;philosophical monism in the 13th century which is the basis of&nbsp;a vigorous sect at the present day; and the “ True Sect of the&nbsp;Pure Land;” founded by his older contemporary Shin-ran, and&nbsp;now the most numerous, wealthy and powerful of the Buddhist&nbsp;denominations, has dropped the original Gotama altogether out&nbsp;of sight, and permits worship to Amida alone, the sublime&nbsp;figure of “ Boundless Light,” whose saving power is appropriated by faith. Here is a monotheism of a definite and clear-cut type, arising apparently by spontaneous development apart&nbsp;from any external impulse.@@<sup>3</sup> On the other hand, the mono</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">theism of Judaism was subject to serious qualifications. An exuberant demonology admitted all kinds of interfering causes&nbsp;in the field of human life. Above man on earth rose rank after&nbsp;rank of angels in the seven heavens. These were of course&nbsp;created, but they were in their turn the agents of the phenomena&nbsp;of nature, “ the angels of the spirit of fire and the angels of the&nbsp;spirit of the winds, and the angels of the spirits of the clouds and&nbsp;of darkness and of snow and of hail and of hoarfrost, and the&nbsp;angels of the voices and of the thunder and of the lightning, and&nbsp;the angels of the spirits of cold and of heat, and of winter and of&nbsp;spring and of autumn and of summer ” </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(Jubilees,</span><span class="font1"> tr. R. H.&nbsp;Charles, ii. 2). These powers are of a well-marked animistic&nbsp;type, and correspond to the Chinese Shin, save that they were&nbsp;not incorporated in the cultus. Higher in rank came various&nbsp;mediating forms, like Wisdom, Memra (the Word) or Shekinah&nbsp;(the Presence), more or less definitely personalized. IMahom-medanism still recognizes innumerable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">jinn</span><span class="font1"> peopling the solitudes&nbsp;of the desert, and over the grave of the deceased saint a little&nbsp;mosque is built, and prayers are offered and miracles performed.@@<sup>4</sup>&nbsp;Christianity has, in like manner, in the course of its long and&nbsp;eventful history, admitted numerous agencies within the sphere&nbsp;of superhuman causation. The Virgin, the angelic hierarchy,&nbsp;the saints, have received the believer’s homage, and answered&nbsp;his petitions. Theology might draw subtle distinctions between&nbsp;different forms of devotion; but, tried by the comparisons of&nbsp;the anthropologist, the monotheism even of historical Christianity cannot be strictly maintained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">6. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Classification.—</span><span class="font1">In the panorama of religious development thus briefly sketched, the different stages constantly appear to&nbsp;shade off into one another, and any one of the higher seems to&nbsp;contain elements of all the rest. This is the great difficulty&nbsp;of classification. All religions, even the most conservative and&nbsp;traditional, are in constant flux, they either advance or decay.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In these processes, which do not take place at equal rates in different cases, all kinds of survivals remain lodged, and&nbsp;embarrass every attempt to fix the place of specific religions&nbsp;in any general course of development. The theologian, the&nbsp;philosopher, the historian, have aU tried their hands at distribution. (i.) The 18th-century divine who divided religions&nbsp;into True and False grimly remarked that the second chapter&nbsp;was much the longer of the two.@@<sup>5</sup> The corresponding distinction&nbsp;into Natural and Revealed breaks down in view of the fact that&nbsp;revelation by dream and oracle, by inspired seer or divine&nbsp;teacher and law-giver, is a practicaUy universal phenomenon&nbsp;in more or less distinctly defined forms, (ii.) Philosophy, in&nbsp;the person of Hegel, classified religion in a threefold form : </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1"> the&nbsp;religion of Nature, (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font1">) the religion of Spiritual Individuality,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(c) the Absolute Religion (Christianity).@@<sup>6</sup> The subdivisions of this scheme have been long since abandoned, as the progress of&nbsp;knowledge rendered them untenable. K. F. A. Wuttke, however,&nbsp;adopted its fundamental idea@@<sup>7</sup> and distinguished three periods&nbsp;or phases: (1) the objective, producing the religions of nature;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the subjective, God as comprehended in the individual mind;</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;God as Absolute Spirit. In the same way Dr Edward Caird@@<sup>8&nbsp;</sup>recognizes three simUar stages: (1) objective consciousness,&nbsp;the divine in nature; (2) self-consciousness, the divine in man '&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(e.g.</span><span class="font1"> Judaism, Stoicism, and modern philosophy of the type of&nbsp;Kant) ; (3) God-consciousness, where God is above the contrast&nbsp;of subject and object, yet is revealed in both (Christianity),&nbsp;(iii.) On the historical side numerous bases have been suggested.&nbsp;(1) Max Müller proposed to group religions ethnologically by&nbsp;tests of language. This had the obvious advantage of lifting&nbsp;two great famiUes into prominence, the Semitic and the Indo-Germanic. The Semitic peoples were closely bound together&nbsp;by common types of thought and civilization, and produced&nbsp;three of the leading religions of the world, Judaism, Christianity&nbsp;and Isläm. But a glance at the table of Indo-Germanic religions</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
