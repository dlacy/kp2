<p><span class="font1">more elevated form in the middle than any other rays, but grows thin towards the edges. The noſe is very&nbsp;ſharp pointed, but ſhort ; the mouth fmall, and filled&nbsp;with granulated teeth. The irides are of a gold colour:&nbsp;behind each eye the orifice is very large. The tail is&nbsp;very thick at the beginning : the ſpine is placed about&nbsp;a third the length of the former from the body; is about&nbsp;five inches long, flat on the top and bottom, very hard,&nbsp;ſharp pointed, and the two ſides thin, and clofely&nbsp;and ſharply bearded the whole Way. The tail extends&nbsp;four inches beyond the end of this ſpine, and grows very&nbsp;deader at the extremity. Theſe ſiſh are obſerved to ſhed&nbsp;their ſpine, and renew them annually ; ſometimes the&nbsp;new ſpine appears before the old one drops off ; and the&nbsp;Corniſh call this fpecies </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">cardinal trilofi,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">three-tailed,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">when ſo circumſtanced. The colour of the upper part&nbsp;of the body is a dirty yellow, the middle part of an obſcure blue : the lower fide white, the tail and ſpine duſky. The weapon with which nature has aimed this&nbsp;fiſh, hath ſupplied the ancients with many tremendous&nbsp;fables relating to it. Pliny, Ælian, and Qppian,&nbsp;have given it a venom that affects even the inanimate&nbsp;creation : trees that are ſtruck by it inſtantly loſe their&nbsp;verdure and periſh, and rocks themfelves are incapable&nbsp;of refilling the potent poiſon. The enchantreſs Circe&nbsp;armed her ſon with a ſpear headed with the ſpine of the&nbsp;trygon, as the moſt irreſiſtible weapon ſhe could furniſh&nbsp;him witjj, ; and with which he afterwards committed&nbsp;parricide, unintentionally, on his lather Ulyſſes. That&nbsp;fpear⅛ and darts might, in very early times, have been&nbsp;headed with this bone inſtead of iron, we have no kind&nbsp;of doubt ; that of another fpecies of this ſiſh being ſtill&nbsp;ufed to point the arrows of ſome of the South American Indians, and is, from its hardneſs, ſharpneſs, and&nbsp;beards, a moſt dreadful weapon. But in reſpect to its&nbsp;venomous qualities, there is not the leaſt credit to be&nbsp;given to the opinion, though it was believed (as far as&nbsp;it affected the animal world) by Rondeletius, Aldro-vand, and others, and even to this day by the fiſhermen&nbsp;in ſeveral parts of the kingdom. It is in fact the wea-pon of offence belonging to the fiſh, capable of giving&nbsp;a very bad wound, and which is attended with dangerous ſymptoms when it falls on a tendinous part or on a&nbsp;perfon in a bad habit of body. As to any fiſh having&nbsp;a ſpine charged with actual poifon, it ſeems very dubious, though the report is ſanctified by the name of&nbsp;Linnæus. He inſtances the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">paftiηaca,</span><span class="font1"> the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">torpedo,</span><span class="font1"> and&nbsp;the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tetrodon (meatus.</span><span class="font1"> The firſt is incapable of conveying a greater injury than what reſults from the mere&nbsp;wound ; the ſecond, from its electric effluvia ; and the&nbsp;third, by imparting a pungent pain like the ſting of&nbsp;nettles, occaſioned by the minute ſpines on its abdomen.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RAILLERY, according to Dr Johnſon, means flight ſatire, or ſatirical merriment ; and a beautiful wri-ter </span><span class="font0">of the laſt century compares it to a light which&nbsp;dazzles, and which does not burn. It is ſometimes i∏-</span><span class="font1">noc'ent and ρleafant, and it ſhould always be ſo, but it&nbsp;is moſt frequently offenſive. Raillery is of various&nbsp;kinds ; there is a ferious, ſevere, and good-humoured&nbsp;raillery ; and there is a kind which perplexes, a kind&nbsp;which offends, and a kind which pleaſes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To rally well, it is abſolutely neceſſary that kindneſs run through a∏ you ſay ; and you muſt ever preſerve&nbsp;the character of a friend to ſupport your pretenſions to&nbsp;be free with a man. Alluſions to paſt follies, hints to&nbsp;revive what a man has a mind to forget for ever, ſhould&nbsp;never be introduced as the ſubjects of raillery. This is&nbsp;not to thruſt with the ſkill of fencers, but to cut with&nbsp;the barbarity of butchers. But it is below the character&nbsp;of men of humanity and good-breeding to be capable&nbsp;of mirth, while there is any in the company in pain and&nbsp;diforder.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RAIN, the deſcent of water from the atmofphere^ in the form of drops of a conſiderable ſize. By this&nbsp;circumſtance it is diſtinguiſhed from dew and fog : in&nbsp;the former of which the drops are ſo ſmall that they&nbsp;are quite inviſible ; and in the latter, though their ſize&nbsp;is larger, they ſeem to have very little more fpecific&nbsp;gravity than the atmoſphere itſelf,. and may therefore&nbsp;be reckoned hollow ſpherules rather than drops.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">It is univerſally agreed, that rain is produced by the water previouſly abſorbed by the heat of the ſun, or&nbsp;otherwiſe, from the terraqueous globe, into the atmoſphere ; but very great difficulties occur when we begin&nbsp;to explain why the water, once ſo cloſely united with&nbsp;the atmoſphere, begins to ſeparate from it. we cannot&nbsp;afcribε this ſeparation to cold, ſince rain often takes&nbsp;place in very warm weather ; and though we ſhould&nbsp;ſuppofe the condenfation owing to the ſuperior cold of&nbsp;the higher regions, yet there is a remarkable fact which&nbsp;will not allow us to have recourſe to this ſuppofition.&nbsp;It is certain that the drops of rain increaſe in ſize con-ſiderably as they deſcend. Οη the top of a hill, for inſtance, they will be finall and inconfiderable, forming&nbsp;only a drizzling ſhower ; but at the bottom of the ſame&nbsp;hill the drops will be exceſſively large, deſcending in&nbsp;an impetuous rain ; which ſhows that the atmoſphere&nbsp;is diſpoſed to condenſe the vapours, and actually does&nbsp;ſo, as well where it is warm as where it is cold.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For ſome time the ſuppoſitions concerning the cauſe of rain were exceedingly inſufficient and unſatisfactory. It was imagined, that when various conge-ries of clouds were driven together by the agitation&nbsp;of the winds, they mixed, and run into one body, by&nbsp;which means they were condenſed into water. The&nbsp;eoldnefs of the upper parts of the air alſo was thought&nbsp;to be a great means of collecting and condenſing the&nbsp;clouds into water ; which, being heavier than the air,&nbsp;muſt neceſſarily fall down through it in the form of&nbsp;rain. The reaſon why it falls in drops, and not in&nbsp;large quantities, was ſaid to be the refiſtance of the air;&nbsp;whereby being broken, and divided into ſmaller and&nbsp;ſmaller parts, it at laſt arrives to us in ſmall drops. But&nbsp;this hypotheſis is entirely contrary to almoſt all the&nbsp;phenomena : for the weather, when coldeſt, that is, in&nbsp;the time of ſevere fioſt, is generally the moſt ſerene ;&nbsp;the moſt violent rains alſo happen where there is little&nbsp;or no cold to condenſe the clouds ; and the drops of&nbsp;rain, inſtead of being divided into ſmaller and finaller&nbsp;ones as they approach the earth, are plainly increaſed&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">in ſizc </span><span class="font1">as they deſcend.</span></p>
