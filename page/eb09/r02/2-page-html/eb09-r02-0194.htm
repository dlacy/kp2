<p><span class="font0">bodiment of its ideal in the Round Table romances. The characters of Galaad and the original Perceval represent&nbsp;types of unattainable perfection, and were therefore models&nbsp;which, although commanding reverence, failed to excite as&nbsp;deep an interest as did the second Perceval, Sir Lancelot,&nbsp;Sir Tristan, and Sir Gawain. In these the noblest qualities&nbsp;were blemished by human frailties, and, as a necessary&nbsp;consequence, the knights miscarried a little below the&nbsp;summit of perfect achievement. Walter Map cannot be&nbsp;sufficiently eulogized for the tact and skill with which he&nbsp;drew the two first-named personages. Galaad is brought&nbsp;upon the stage for but a very short time, and is then dismissed in a blaze of saintly glory, while Perceval, although&nbsp;adapted from the French writer’s purer knight of that&nbsp;name, is allowed a much larger space upon the canvas, at&nbsp;the cost of a few minor sins which suffice to ensure his&nbsp;failure and to prove him a man. The other knights are&nbsp;brave, generous, self-sacrificing, and devout, but the indispensable virtue of chastity is absent from their lives, and&nbsp;they are foredoomed to misfortune. The perfect ideal,&nbsp;however, underlies the description of all their acts and&nbsp;motives, and the reader or hearer was never allowed to&nbsp;forget it amid the more powerful attractions of the story.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The real prototype of the chivalric romance was the ancient epic : the Greek and Latin poems upon the winning of the Golden Fleece, the siege of Troy, the wanderings of Ulysses and of Æneas, furnish the truest parallel&nbsp;to the mediæval romances of knighthood. The tales&nbsp;which are usually dignified with the name of “classical&nbsp;romances ” have really no claim to that rank ; they were&nbsp;produced in the age of decadence and correspond much&nbsp;more closely to the mediæval </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fabliau</span><span class="font0"> and the 17th-century&nbsp;novel than to the romance proper. As a matter of course&nbsp;every nation had its legends and popular tales, co-existent with literary works of greater importance ; but the&nbsp;Greeks at least, and the Romans following their example,&nbsp;never condescended during their ages of intellectual vigour&nbsp;to put such figments into written form, so that even the&nbsp;famous Milesian tales are now quite lost. It was not&nbsp;until the Greeks became a widely dispersed, a subject and&nbsp;deteriorated race, and not till the strength and manhood&nbsp;of Rome were buried in the slough of imperial corruption,&nbsp;that sophists and rhetoricians began to construct those&nbsp;artificial tales which we call Greek and Latin romances.&nbsp;They form, however, an epoch, as the earliest prose works&nbsp;of imagination in a European language, and cannot therefore remain unnoticed here. They were succeeded in time&nbsp;by Christian narratives, usually woven into the lives of&nbsp;saints or used as illustrations in the sermons of great&nbsp;preachers ; these latter formed a transition to the semireligious story of the Grail, a bowl or goblet confounded&nbsp;with the chalice used at the Last Supper, with the cup&nbsp;used to collect the precious blood of our Lord, and symbolically with the Holy Sepulchre itself. The achievers of&nbsp;the Grail-quest, or kings of the Grail, were typified in the&nbsp;Knights Templars and the Knights of St John ; thus the&nbsp;true school of romance arose in intimate connexion with&nbsp;the changes in European life and manners which were&nbsp;brought about by the crusades.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">chansons de geste,</span><span class="font0"> which constituted a poetical introduction to the romances of chivalry in France, were followed by the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fabliaux,</span><span class="font0"> metrical novelettes which furnished material to the Italian writers of prose tales in the 14th&nbsp;and 15th centuries,—a form of composition which was not&nbsp;acclimatized elsewhere than in Italy till the 16th century,&nbsp;and which then became the remote prototype of the modern&nbsp;novel. The older and nobler knighthood blossomed in&nbsp;France for the last time in Bayard, in England in Sir&nbsp;Philip Sidney ; but the genuine literature of chivalric&nbsp;romance may be said to have come to an end with the&nbsp;l5th century. The knightly romances produced in the&nbsp;16 th century were belated and artificial examples of their&nbsp;class ; and, although the effects of the conquest of Granada&nbsp;and the discovery of America did not wholly put an end&nbsp;to the lingering romantic spirit in Spain, it hardly survived them for half a century. Hence the inferior character of most of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ubros de caballerias,</span><span class="font0"> which chiefly date&nbsp;from the l6th century. Out of them grew the fictions&nbsp;known as 16th and 17th century romance in Spain, France,&nbsp;and England,—monstrous and uninviting examples of perverted ingenuity, utterly dissonant from the literature of&nbsp;pure romance as we conceive it in the chivalrous fictions&nbsp;of the l2th, 13th, and l4th centuries. A more practical&nbsp;and utilitarian spirit set in with the latter half of the&nbsp;17th century, in which readers found themselves out of&nbsp;sympathy with the imaginative and mysterious atmosphere&nbsp;of romance. Accordingly the modern novel arose, a form&nbsp;of composition in which the manners and customs of&nbsp;everyday life were more or less faithfully depicted, and&nbsp;which has remained in undiminished popularity to the&nbsp;present time.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">Although the distance in manner is immense between the Ass of Lucian and the Awz&lt;A⅛ </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de Gaula,</span><span class="font0"> and again&nbsp;between the latter and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ivanhoe</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Eugenie Grandet,</span><span class="font0"> there&nbsp;are few varieties of modern fiction which are not faintly&nbsp;shadowed forth in the literatures of Greece and Rome&nbsp;(including in this denomination the post-classical periods&nbsp;of Italy and Byzantium) : fables and tales, historical,&nbsp;philosophical, and religious novels, love-stories and narratives of adventure, marvellous voyages, collections of fictitious letters—all forms are represented. As even the&nbsp;Andaman Islander and the Bushman have their stories, it&nbsp;is reasonable to suppose that the Greek, who attained a&nbsp;high state of civilization at an extremely remote period,&nbsp;had long been familiar with this method of intellectual&nbsp;gratification. Artistic form was first given to the higher&nbsp;class of such narrations by the Ionians of the Asiatic&nbsp;colonies, when they sang the deeds of gods and heroes in&nbsp;epic poetry and put together the story of Troy now current&nbsp;under the name of Homer. F rom the Attic Greeks belonging to the same stock came the drama in its highest development,—a fresh step in the representation of events&nbsp;in oral shape. Greek romance is a double misnomer.&nbsp;First, the word “ romance ” is wrongly applied to the tales&nbsp;we shall shortly discuss ; and secondly, we have no right&nbsp;to call anything in art </span><span class="font1">or </span><span class="font0">literature Greek unless it w¾s&nbsp;produced before the time of Alexander the Great, either&nbsp;in Hellas or Ionia or Sicily, or, say, between 800 and 300&nbsp;B.c. After the defeat of the Greeks at Chæronea, Macedonia became the ruling centre, and the free political life&nbsp;of the Greek cities passed away. The conquests of Alexander, a Græco-Albanian monarch, spread Greek civilization throughout the known world, but crushed Greece&nbsp;proper out of existence. This civilization (see Greece,&nbsp;vol. xi. p. 136 sg.), influencing peoples foreign to the&nbsp;Greek race, is designated Hellenistic as opposed to the&nbsp;Hellenic, and the chief note of Hellenistic literature is&nbsp;that of imitation. The original springs of Hellenic poetry&nbsp;were dried up, and from the 3d century B.c. the newly</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
