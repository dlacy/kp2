<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Ramusio had witnessed from his boyhood the unrolling of that great series of discoveries by Portugal and Spain in&nbsp;East and West, and the love of geography thus kindled in&nbsp;him made that branch of knowledge through life his chief&nbsp;study and delight. He is said, with the assistance of&nbsp;friends touched by the same flame, to have opened a&nbsp;school for geography in his house at Venice. And it&nbsp;appears from a letter addressed to him by his friend&nbsp;Andrea Xavagero, that as early as 1523 the preparation&nbsp;of material for his great work had already begun. The&nbsp;task had been suggested and encouraged, as Ramusio himself states in a dedicatory epistle to the famous Girolamo&nbsp;Fracastoro, by that scholar, his lifelong friend ; an address&nbsp;to the same personage indeed introduced each of the three&nbsp;volumes, and in the first the writer speaks of his desire to&nbsp;bequeath to posterity, along with his labours, “a testimony&nbsp;to the long and holy friendship that had existed between&nbsp;the two.” They were contemporaries in the strictest sense&nbsp;(Ramusio 1-185-1557, Fracastorius 1483-1553). His correspondence, which was often devoted to the collection of&nbsp;new material for his work, was immense, and embraced&nbsp;many distinguished men. Among those whose names&nbsp;have still an odour of celebrity were Fracastoro, just mentioned, Cardinal Bembo, Damiano de Goez, and Sebastian&nbsp;Cabot; among lesser lights, Vettor Fausto, Daniel Barbaro,&nbsp;Paolo Manuzio, Andrea Xavagero, the cardinals Gasparo&nbsp;Contarini and Gregorio Córtese, and the printer Tommaso&nbsp;Giunti, editor after Ramusio’s death of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Navigationi.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Before speaking more particularly of this work we may&nbsp;conclude the history of the family.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Paolo (Girolamo Gaspare)@@<sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1532-1600) was the only child of Gian Battista, and ־was born on 4tli July 1532.&nbsp;Like his father, he maintained a large correspondence with&nbsp;many persons of learning and note. In 1541 Francesco&nbsp;Contarini, procurator of St Mark’s, brought from Brussels&nbsp;a MS. of Yillehardouin’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">History of the Conquest of Constantinople,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> which he presented to the Council of Ten. In&nbsp;1556 they publicly ordered its translation into Latin, and&nbsp;gave the commission to Paolo Rannusio. His father also&nbsp;seems to have taken much interest in the work, for a MS.&nbsp;vernacular translation by him exists in the Marciana.&nbsp;Paolo’s book was not completed till 1573, many years&nbsp;after the father’s death, and was in fact a paraphrase&nbsp;enlarged from other sources, thus, according to Cigogna’s&nbsp;questionable judgment, “ converting the dry story of Ville-hardouin into an elegant (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">fiorita)</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> historical work.” It&nbsp;was not published till 1609, nine years after Paolo’s&nbsp;death; nor was it ever really reprinted, though it became&nbsp;the subject of a singular and unintelligible forgery. For&nbsp;Jacopo Gaflarelli, who was sent to Venice to buy books&nbsp;for Richelieu, having apparently procured the “ remainder ”&nbsp;copies, removed the title and preliminary pages and substituted a fresh title with the date 1634, and a dedication&nbsp;to his master the cardinal.@@<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Girolamo Giuseppe </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">(1555-1611), the son of Paolo, was born at Venice in 1555. He entered the public service in&nbsp;1577, and was employed in connexion with various foreign&nbsp;missions. In 1601 he published at Lyons the French&nbsp;text of Villehardouin; and, besides an Italian translation&nbsp;of this old historian (who seems thus to have furnished&nbsp;occupation for three generations of Ramusios), he left&nbsp;behind him a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Storia o Cronaca di Casa Ramusia,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> a folio</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">MS. still in St Mark’s Library. He died at Padua in 1611, and his posterity did nothing to continue the reputation of the family, official or literary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">We revert to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Navigation{ e Viaggi.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> Two volumes only were published during the life of Gian Battista, vol. i. in 1550, vol. iii.&nbsp;in 1556 ; vol. ii. did not appear till 1559, two years after his&nbsp;death, delayed, as his friend and printer T. Giunti explains, not&nbsp;only by that event hut by a fire in the printing-office (November&nbsp;1557), which destroyed a part of the material which had been&nbsp;prepared. It had been Ramusio’s intention to publish a fourth&nbsp;volume, containing, as he mentions himself, documents relating to&nbsp;the Andes, and, as appears from one of the prefaces of Giunti,&nbsp;others relating to explorations towards the Antarctic.@@® Ramusio’s&nbsp;collection was by no means the first of the kind, though it was,&nbsp;and we may say on the whole continues to be, the best. Even&nbsp;before the invention of the press such collections were known, of&nbsp;which that made by a certain Long John of Ypres, abbot of St&nbsp;Bertin, in the latter half of the 14th century was most meritorious,&nbsp;and afforded in its transcription a splendid field for embellishment&nbsp;by the miniaturists, which was not disregarded. The best of the&nbsp;printed collections before Ramusio’s was the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Novus Orbis,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> edited&nbsp;at Basel by Simon Grynaeus in 1532, and reissued in 1537 and&nbsp;1555. This, however, can boast of no disquisitions nor of much&nbsp;editorial judgment. Ramusio’s collection is in these respects far&nbsp;superior, as well as in the variety and fulness of its matter. He&nbsp;spared no pains in ransacking Italy and the Spanish peninsula for&nbsp;contributions, and in translating them when needful into the racy&nbsp;Italian of his day. Several of the pieces are very rare in any other&nbsp;shape than that exhibited in Ramusio’s collection ; several besides&nbsp;ofimportance—«.g., the in valuable travels of Barbosa and Pigafetta’s&nbsp;account of Magellan’s voyage—were not publicly known in any&nbsp;complete form till the present century. Of two important articles&nbsp;at least the originals have never been otherwise printed or discovered ; one of these is the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Summary of all the Kingdoms, Cities,&nbsp;and Nations from the Red Sea to China,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> a work translated from the&nbsp;Portuguese, and dating apparently from about 1535 ; the other,&nbsp;the remarkable Ramusian redaction of </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Marco Polo </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">(q. v</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">.). The&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Prefatione, Espositione,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Dicliiarazionc,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> which precede this version of Marco Polo’s book, are the best and amplest examples of&nbsp;Ramusio’s own style as an editor. They are full of good sense and&nbsp;of interesting remarks derived from his large reading and experience, and few pictures in words were ever touched more delightfully&nbsp;than that in which he sketches the return of the Polo family to&nbsp;their native city, as he had received it in the tradition of the&nbsp;Venetian elders.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">There were several editions of the </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Kavigationi e Viaggi,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and as additions continued to be made to the several volumes a good deal&nbsp;of bibliographical interest attaches to these various modifications.@@<sup>4&nbsp;</sup>The two volumes (i. and iii.) published in Ramusio’s lifetime do not&nbsp;bear his name on the title-page, nor does it appear in the addresses&nbsp;to his friend Fracastorius with which these volumes begin (as does&nbsp;also the second and posthumous volume). The editions of vol. i.&nbsp;are as follows—1550, 1554, 1563, 1588, 1606, 1613.@@5 The edition&nbsp;of 1554 contains the following articles which are not in that of&nbsp;1550,—(1) copious index; (2) “Narr. di un Compagno di Barbosa”;&nbsp;(3) “ Information! del Giapan ” ; (4) “ Alii Lettori di Giov. de&nbsp;Barros”; (5) “Capitoli estratti da di Barros.” The edition of&nbsp;1563 adds to these a preliminary leaf concerning Ramusio, “Tommaso Giunti alii Lettori.” After 1563 there is no change in the&nbsp;contents of this volume, only in the title-page. It should be added&nbsp;that in the edition of 1554 there are three double-page woodcut&nbsp;maps (Africa, India, and India extra Gangern), which do not exist&nbsp;in the edition of 1550, and which are replaced by copper-plate&nbsp;maps in subsequent editions. These maps are often missing. The&nbsp;editions of vol. ii. are as follows—1559, 1574, 1583, 1606. There&nbsp;are important additions in the 1574 copy, and still further additions in that of 1583. The additions made in 1574 were—(1)&nbsp;“Herberstein, Della Moscovia e della Russia”; (2) “Viaggio in&nbsp;Persia di Caterino Zeno” ; (3) “Scoprimento dell’ Isola Frislanda,&nbsp;&amp;c., per due fratelli Zeni ” ; (4) “Viaggi in Tartaria per alcuni frati&nbsp;Minori” ; (5) “Viaggio del Beato Odorico” (two versions). Further&nbsp;additions made in 1583 were—(1) “Navigatione di Seb. Cabota”;&nbsp;(2) at the end 90 if. with fresh pagination, containing ten articles&nbsp;on “ Sarmatia, Polonia, Lithuania, Prussia, Livonia, Moscovia, and&nbsp;the Tartars by Aless. Guagnino and Matteo di Miclieovo.” The&nbsp;two latest “editions” of vol. ii. are identical, </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">i.e.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> from the same&nbsp;type, with a change of title-page only, and a reprint of the last leaf&nbsp;of the preface and of the last leaf of the book. But the last circumstance does not apply to all copies. In one now before the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>

In this view he had visited Prester John and the Jews in his kingdom,&nbsp;and then various European countries. David was dark in complexion,&nbsp;“ like an Abyssinian,” lean, dry, and Arab-like, well dressed and well&nbsp;attended, full of pretensions to supernatural cabalistic knowledge, and&nbsp;with enthusiastic ideas about his mission, whilst the Jews regarded him&nbsp;as a veritable Messiah.</span></p>
