<p><label>RAILLERY</label>
according to Dr Johnſon, means flight ſatire, or ſatirical merriment ; and a beautiful wri-ter of the laſt century compares it to a light which dazzles, and which does not burn. It is ſometimes i∏-noc'ent and ρleafant, and it ſhould always be ſo, but it is moſt frequently offenſive. Raillery is of various kinds ; there is a ferious, ſevere, and good-humoured raillery ; and there is a kind which perplexes, a kind which offends, and a kind which pleaſes.</p><p>To rally well, it is abſolutely neceſſary that kindneſs run through a∏ you ſay ; and you muſt ever preſerve the character of a friend to ſupport your pretenſions to be free with a man. Alluſions to paſt follies, hints to revive what a man has a mind to forget for ever, ſhould never be introduced as the ſubjects of raillery. This is not to thruſt with the ſkill of fencers, but to cut with the barbarity of butchers. But it is below the character of men of humanity and good-breeding to be capable of mirth, while there is any in the company in pain and diforder.</p>
