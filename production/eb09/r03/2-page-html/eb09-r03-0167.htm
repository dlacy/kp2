<p><span class="font0">tinct sets of motions in an ordinary laying machine. Fig. 5, in which only one bobbin frame is shown, will make plain one method&nbsp;of communicating these three motions,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which in this case are controlled by a series of three shafts, placed one within&nbsp;the other. The external shaft gives&nbsp;motion to tho entire apparatus, and its&nbsp;revolution in one direction forms the&nbsp;rope, which passes away over a pulley.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The second shaft controls the spur wheel α, which, geared into the spur-wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a’&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">attached to the bobbin frame, turns it&nbsp;in a direction contrary to the motion of&nbsp;the whole. The internal shaft gears into&nbsp;a spur-wheel </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b,</span><span class="font0"> which again is centred&nbsp;on a tubular shaft </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> passing into the&nbsp;bobbin frame, and by a pair of bevel&nbsp;wheels controlling the rate of motion of&nbsp;the “drawing-off” pulley </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d,</span><span class="font0"> around&nbsp;which the strand is once wound, and&nbsp;from which it is conveyed by the tubular shaft to a small guide pulley on the&nbsp;upper part of the revolving frame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">An American rope-laying machine is in use, similar in principle to the forming machine fig. 4, from which it differs&nbsp;only in having the strand bobbins&nbsp;mounted in flyers to give the strand the&nbsp;necessary amount of forehard in laying.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Wire Rope.—</span><span class="font0">Ropes made of wire have only come into use in the course of the&nbsp;present century, but now their employment is very extensive, and they play an&nbsp;important part in connexion with traction railways, mines, collieries, hoists, steam ploughing, and many&nbsp;other modern developments of industry. In the year 1822 a suspension bridge of wire was erected at Geneva. The wire used in this&nbsp;case, however, was not twisted, but consisted of parallel bundles&nbsp;bound with wire and other coverings wrapped spirally around them&nbsp;to compact and keep the whole together. A bundle of small wires&nbsp;so treated presents the maximum of strain-resisting power combined&nbsp;with great rigidity, but it is obviously unsuited for most of the uses&nbsp;to which rope is put. Formed wire rope, consisting of strands laid&nbsp;in the manner of ordinary rope, began to be made about 1837 ; and&nbsp;now wire ropes of many kinds and dimensions are made from charcoal iron wire of fine quality, from mild steel, and from fine crucible&nbsp;steel. Copper wire and brass wire are also used for rope-making.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wire ropes are stranded and laid or closed in machines which do not differ in essential features from the ordinary rope-making&nbsp;machinery. Both vertical and horizontal forms of revolving&nbsp;machines are used ; but, as the rope-closing machine has sometimes&nbsp;to carry as many as nine bobbins of strand, each with about two&nbsp;tons of wire, a vertical machine is best for enormous weights. An&nbsp;ingenious wire-rope machine has been invented by Mr Archibald&nbsp;Smith, in which the bobbins of wire are suspended, and only the&nbsp;framework around them and the wire drawn off are rotated for&nbsp;the forming and laying operations, and thus the necessity for rotating these enormous weights at a high speed is obviated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The number of wires in a wire-rope strand are few—generally from six to nine, and never more than eighteen. They are lightly&nbsp;twisted in the stranding machine, and they receive no foretwist&nbsp;in the rope-closing apparatus. The strands, on the other hand,&nbsp;which go to form a rope are numerous—from six to nine and upwards ; and they are always wound round a core, which is generally&nbsp;of hemp, but sometimes a wire core is used. A wire rope thus&nbsp;forms a series of gentle spirals arranged continuously round a core. A&nbsp;large proportion of the wire is galvanized, to protect it from rusting.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">RORQUAL. See </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Whale.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROSA, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Salvator</span><span class="font1"> (1615-1673), a renowned painter of the Neapolitan school, was born in Arenella, in the outskirts of Naples, in 1615: the precise day is given as 20th&nbsp;June, and also as 21st July. His father, Vito Antonio de&nbsp;Rosa, a land surveyor, was bent upon making the youth a&nbsp;lawyer, and sent him to study in the convent of the&nbsp;Somaschi fathers. Here Salvator began showing a turn&nbsp;for art : he went in secret to his maternal uncle Paolo&nbsp;Greco to learn the practice of painting, but soon found&nbsp;that Greco had little pictorial lore to impart, so he transferred himself to his own brother-in-law Francesco Fracan-zaro, a pupil of Ribera, and afterwards had some practiçe&nbsp;under Ribera himself. Above all he went to nature, frequenting the Neapolitan coast, and keeping his eyes open&nbsp;and his hand busy. At the age of seventeen he lost his&nbsp;father ; the widow was left unprovided for, with at least&nbsp;five children, and Salvator found himself immersed in a&nbsp;sea of troubles and perplexities, with nothing for the&nbsp;while to stem them except a buoyant and adventurous&nbsp;temperament. He obtained some instruction under the&nbsp;battle-painter Aniello Falcone, but chiefly painted in&nbsp;solitude, haunting romantic and desolate spots, beaches,&nbsp;mountains, caverns, verdure-clad recesses. Hence he&nbsp;became in process of time the initiator of romantic landscape, with a special turn for scenes of strange or picturesque aspect—often turbulent and rugged, at times grand,&nbsp;and with suggestions of the sublime. He picked up scanty&nbsp;doles when he could get them, and his early landscapes&nbsp;sold for a few pence to petty dealers. The first person to&nbsp;discover that Rosa’s work was not as trumpery as it was&nbsp;cheap was the painter Iianfranco, who bought some of the&nbsp;paintings, and advised the youth to go to Rome. Hither&nbsp;in 1635, at the age of twenty, Rosa betook himself; he&nbsp;studied with enthusiasm, but, catching fever, he returned&nbsp;to Naples and Falcone, and for a while painted nothing&nbsp;but battle-pieces, and these without exciting any attention. This class of work was succeeded by the landscape&nbsp;art peculiarly characteristic of him—wild scenes wildly&nbsp;peopled with shepherds, seamen, or especially soldiers.&nbsp;He then revisited Rome, and was housed by Cardinal&nbsp;Brancaccio ; this prelate being made bishop of Viterbo,&nbsp;Rosa painted for the Chiesa della Morte a large and&nbsp;noticeable picture of the Incredulity of Thomas—the first&nbsp;work of sacred art which we find recorded from his hand.&nbsp;At Viterbo he made acquaintance with a mediocre poet&nbsp;named Abati, and was hence incited to try his own faculty&nbsp;in verse. He then returned to Naples. Here the monopolizing triumvirate—Ribera, Caracciolo, and Corenzio—&nbsp;were still powerful. Rosa was as yet too obscure to suffer&nbsp;from their machinations ; but, having painted a picture of&nbsp;Tityus Torn by the Vulture, which went to Rome and&nbsp;there produced a great sensation, he found it politic to&nbsp;follow in the footsteps of his fame, and once more, in&nbsp;1638, resought the papal city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rosa was a man of facile and versatile genius, and had by this time several strings to his bow. It is said that,&nbsp;still keeping painting steadily in view as his real objective,&nbsp;he resolved to secure attention first as a musician, poet,&nbsp;improvisatore, and actor—his mother-wit and broad&nbsp;Neapolitan dialect (which appears to have stuck to him&nbsp;through life) standing him powerfully in stead. In the&nbsp;carnival he masqued as Formica and Capitan Coviello,&nbsp;and bustled about Rome distributing satirical prescriptions&nbsp;for diseases of the body and more particularly of the&nbsp;mind. As Formica he inveighed against the farcical&nbsp;comedies acted in the Trastevere under the direction of&nbsp;the celebrated Bernini. Some of the actors, in one of&nbsp;their performances, retaliated by insulting Rosa, but the&nbsp;public was with him, and he now enjoyed every form of</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
