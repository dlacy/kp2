<p><span class="font1">park 12 acres in extent. The parish church of St Chad, occupying the high grounds overlooking the town, is built&nbsp;on the site of a church which was erected in the 12th&nbsp;century. The town-hall is a very extensive and elaborate&nbsp;structure in the Decorated Gothic style, and had originally&nbsp;a tower surmounted by a gilded spire 140 feet in height,&nbsp;which was destroyed by fire in 1883. The building, completed in 1871 at a cost of £150,000, includes a large&nbsp;lιall for public meetings and various municipal rooms.&nbsp;For the free public library, with about 40,000 volumes, a&nbsp;new building was opened in. 1884. Of the educational&nbsp;charities the principal are the Archbishop Parker free&nbsp;grammar-school, founded in 1565, and the free English&nbsp;school. Among the other public institutions are the infirmary (lately much enlarged), the literary and scientific&nbsp;society, and the art society. The staple manufactures&nbsp;are those of woollens and cottons. There are, besides,&nbsp;foundries, iron-works, and machine-factories. Coal and&nbsp;stone are obtained extensively in the neighbourhood of the&nbsp;town. Rochdale was the birthplace of the co-operative&nbsp;movement. The town was first incorporated in 1856 and&nbsp;divided into three wards, but when the area of the municipal borough was extended and made coextensive -with&nbsp;the parliamentary borough it was divided into ten wards,&nbsp;governed by a mayor, ten aldermen, and thirty councilmen.&nbsp;Rochdale has returned one member to the House of Commons since the Reform Act of 1832. The population of&nbsp;the borough (area, 4172 acres) in 1871 was 63,485, and&nbsp;in 1881 it was 68,866.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In early times Rochdale was situated entirely in the township of Castleton, where at one time stood the castle which gave its name&nbsp;to the township. Near the town are the remains of a Roman road&nbsp;leading over the Blackstone Edge Hills, which separate Lancashire&nbsp;and Yorkshire. The name Rochdale appears in Domesday Book as&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reeedam,</span><span class="font0"> and it was subsequent to the Norman Conquest that the&nbsp;town began to spread into the valley of the Roch. From the time&nbsp;of William the Conqueror the manor and estates were held by the&nbsp;De Lacys, but after some centuries they became merged in the&nbsp;crown. By Elizabeth they were bestowed on Sir John Byron, and&nbsp;in 1823 they were sold by Lord Byron the poet to James Dearden,&nbsp;in whose family they now remain. The town obtained a charter&nbsp;for a market in the reign of Richard I. ; this charter was confirmed by Henry III., who added the privilege of holding an&nbsp;annual fair.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROCHEFORT, a town of France, the chef-lieu of an arrondissement of the department of Charente Inférieure&nbsp;and of the fourth maritime prefecture, lies on the right&nbsp;bank of the Charente, 9 miles from the Atlantic, and is&nbsp;built partly on the side of a rocky hill and partly on old&nbsp;marshland, which renders the position unhealthy. The&nbsp;town is laid out with great regularity in chess-board&nbsp;fashion. The fortifications are sufficient merely to prevent&nbsp;it being taken by surprise. By rail it is connected with&nbsp;La Rochelle (18 miles north-north-west), Niort, and&nbsp;Saintes. There are both a naval and a commercial harbour.&nbsp;The former has the advantage of deep anchorage well protected by batteries at the mouth of the river, and the&nbsp;roadstead is perfectly safe. The windings of the channel,&nbsp;however, between Rochefort and the sea, and the bar at&nbsp;the entrance render navigation dangerous. This harbour&nbsp;and arsenal, which are separated from the town by a line&nbsp;of fortifications with three gates, contain large covered&nbsp;building yards (where eighteen vessels of the first class&nbsp;may be upon the stocks at once), eleven slips, three repairing docks, and on the right bank of the Charente in the&nbsp;Gardette meadows a large timber basin capable of floating&nbsp;1,766,000 cubic feet of timber. Besides the various establishments implied in the name, the arsenal is the seat of a&nbsp;ropewalk dating from 1666, a school of navigation and&nbsp;pilotage, a signal-tower 98 feet high (once attached to a&nbsp;church), the offices of the maritime prefecture, the navy&nbsp;commissariat, a park of artillery, and various boards of&nbsp;direction connected with the navy. About 5000 or 6000&nbsp;men are usually employed in the arsenal. Other Government establishments at Rochefort are barracks for infantry,&nbsp;artillery, and marines, a provision factory, and the naval&nbsp;hospital· (800 beds) and school of medicine. In the&nbsp;grounds of this last institution is an artesian well, sunk&nbsp;in 1862-66 to a depth of 2800 feet and yielding water at&nbsp;a temperature of 107° Fahr. The commercial harbour,&nbsp;higher up the river than the naval harbour, has two&nbsp;basins with an aggregate area of 5 acres and 3400 feet of&nbsp;quays, and a third basin is being constructed (1885) 25&nbsp;acres in extent with 3800 feet of quays, capable of admitting large vessels on every day of the year. The town&nbsp;has good public and botanic gardens, and the Place Colbert contains an allegorical group representing the ocean&nbsp;and the Charente mingling their waters. Besides shipbuilding, which forms the staple industry of Rochefort,&nbsp;sailcloth and furniture are the local manufactures, and&nbsp;hemp for cordage is grown in the vicinity. Along with&nbsp;Tonnay-Charente, 4 miles higher up, Rochefort has a trade&nbsp;in brandies, salt, grain, flour, cattle, horses, fish, colonial&nbsp;wares, timber, and coal. There is regular steamboat communication with the United Kingdom. In 1882 285&nbsp;vessels (128,570 tons) entered and 270 (123,501) cleared.&nbsp;The population of the town was 26,022 in 1881 (27,854&nbsp;in the commune).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The lordship of Rochefort, held by powerful nobles as early as the 11th century, was united to the French crown by Philip the&nbsp;Fair in 1303 ; but it was alternately seized in the course of the&nbsp;Hundred Years’ War by the English and the French, and in the wars&nbsp;of religion by the Catholics and Protestants. Colbert having in&nbsp;1665 chosen Rochefort as the seat of a repairing port between Brest&nbsp;and the Gironde, the town rapidly increased in importance : by&nbsp;1674 it had 20,000 inhabitants; and, when the Dutch admiral&nbsp;Tromp appeared at the mouth of the river with seventy-two vessels&nbsp;for the purpose of destroying the new arsenal, he found the approaches so well defended that he gave up his enterprise. It λvas&nbsp;at Rochefort that the naval school now transferred to Brest was&nbsp;originally founded. The town continued to flourish in the later&nbsp;part of the 17th century. In 1690 and in 1703 it escaped from&nbsp;the attempts made by the English to destroy it. Its fleet under&nbsp;the command of La Galissonnière, a native of the place, did distinguished service in the wars of American independence, the republic, and the empire. But the destruction of the French fleet&nbsp;by the English in 1809 in the roadstead of lie d’Aix, the preference&nbsp;accorded to the harbours of Brest and Toulon, and the unhealthiness&nbsp;of its climate have seriously interfered with the prosperity of the&nbsp;place. The convict establishment founded at Rochefort in 1777&nbsp;was suppressed in 1852.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROCHELLE, La, a town and seaport of France, the chef-lieu of the department of Charente-Inférieure, is situated on the Atlantic coast in 46° 9' N. lat., 296 miles by rail&nbsp;south-west of Paris. Its fortifications, which were constructed by Vauban, have a circuit of 3j miles with seven&nbsp;gates. In population (20,028 in 1881 ; 22,464 in the&nbsp;commune) it ranks after Rochefort. The harbour, one of&nbsp;the safest and most accessible on the coast, comprises an&nbsp;outer harbour, a tidal basin, a wet dock, and a graving&nbsp;dock. The outer harbour is still protected by the dry&nbsp;stone mole, about a mile long, constructed by Richelieu.&nbsp;The wet dock (7 acres) is capable of receiving ships of&nbsp;1000 tons. Behind these is the Maubec basin, the water&nbsp;of which along with that of the Niort Canal helps to scour&nbsp;the port and navigable channel. On the fortifications&nbsp;towards the sea are three towers, of which the oldest (1384)&nbsp;is that of St Nicholas. The apartment in the first story&nbsp;was formerly used as a chapel. The chain tower (1476)&nbsp;was at one time connected with that of St Nicholas by a&nbsp;great pointed arch. The lantern tower (1475-76), seven&nbsp;stories high, affords a fine view of the town, the roadstead,&nbsp;and the surrounding islands, and at present is used as a&nbsp;military prison. Of the ancient gateways only one has&nbsp;been preserved in its entirety, that of the “grosse hor&nbsp;loge,” a huge square tower of the 14th or 15th century,</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
