<p><span class="font0">on the stairs of the CapitoL This proved the end of the banderesi and of the liberties of Rome. The government&nbsp;was again directed by an alien senator together with three&nbsp;conservators, but the latter were gradually deprived of&nbsp;their political attributes, and became mere civil officers.&nbsp;The militia, regions, guilds, and other associations now&nbsp;rapidly lost all political importance, and before long were&nbsp;little more than empty names. Thus in 1398 the Romans&nbsp;submitted to the complete sway of the pope, and in July&nbsp;of the same year the senator chosen by him was Mala-testa dei Malatesti of Rimini, one of a line of tyrants, a&nbsp;valiant soldier, who was also temporal vicar and captain&nbsp;general of the church. Boniface continued to appoint&nbsp;foreign senators during the rest of his life ; he fortified&nbsp;Castle St Angelo, the Vatican, and the Capitol ; he&nbsp;stationed galleys at the mouth of the Tiber, and proved&nbsp;himself in all things a thoroughly temporal prince. He&nbsp;aggrandized all his kindred, especially his brother, and,&nbsp;with the aid of his senator, his armed force, and the&nbsp;protection of Ladislaus, succeeded in keeping down all&nbsp;the surviving nobles. In 1400, however, these made an&nbsp;attempt to upset the Government. Niccolb Colonna forced&nbsp;his way into the city with cries of “ Popolo, popolo ! death&nbsp;to Boniface ! ” But the Romans had grown deaf to the&nbsp;voice of liberty; they refused to rise, and the senator, a&nbsp;λ<sup>r</sup>enetian named Zaccaria Trevisan, behaved with much&nbsp;energy. Colonna and his men had to beat a swift retreat&nbsp;to Palestrina. A charge of high treason was immediately&nbsp;instituted against him, and thirty-one rebels were beheaded.&nbsp;The pope then proclaimed a crusade against all the&nbsp;Colonna, and sent a body of two thousand men and some&nbsp;of the Neapolitan soldiery to attack them. Several of their&nbsp;estates were seized and devastated, but Palestrina continued to hold out, and on the 7th January 1401 the&nbsp;Colonna finally made submission to the pope. Nevertheless they obtained advantageous terms, for Boniface left&nbsp;them their lands, appointed them vicars of other territories,&nbsp;and made similar agreements with the Gaetani and&nbsp;Orsini. In this way he became absolute master of Rome.&nbsp;One chronicler remarks that “Romanis tanquam rigidus&nbsp;imperator dominabatur, ” and the same tone is taken by&nbsp;others. But he did not succeed in putting an end to the&nbsp;schism of the church, which was still going on when he&nbsp;died in the Vatican on the 1st October 1404.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Innocent VII. (1404-6) was the next pope. He too was a Neapolitan, and on his election the people again rose&nbsp;in revolt and refused to acknowledge him unless he&nbsp;consented to resign the temporal power. But Ladislaus&nbsp;of Naples hastened to his help, and an agreement was made&nbsp;which, under the cover of apparent concessions, really&nbsp;riveted the people’s chains. Rome was recognized as the&nbsp;seat of the temporal and spiritual sovereignty of the pope,&nbsp;and the pope continued to appoint the senator. The&nbsp;people were to elect seven governors of the city, who were&nbsp;to swear fealty to the pope and carry on the government&nbsp;in conjunction with three other governors chosen by the&nbsp;pontiff or Ladislaus. The stipulations of Boniface IX.&nbsp;concerning ecclesiastical immunities were again confirmed.&nbsp;Γhe barons were forbidden to place more than five lances&nbsp;each at the service of the people, and—which was the real&nbsp;gist of the covenant—the people were henceforth forbidden&nbsp;to make laws or statutes without the permission of the&nbsp;pope. The captain of the people, deprived of his political&nbsp;and judicial functions and reduced to a simple judge, was&nbsp;also to be chosen by the pope. But this treaty, drawn up&nbsp;on the 27th October 1404, was not signed at the time, and&nbsp;many difficulties and disturbances arose when its terms&nbsp;were to be put into effect. The Romans nominated the&nbsp;seven governors, but, without waiting until the pope had&nbsp;chosen three more, placed the state in their hands,&nbsp;and styled them governors of the liberty of the Roman&nbsp;republic. They were in fact banderesi or reformatori&nbsp;under a new name. But the attempt proved inefficacious,&nbsp;for, at the pope’s first threat of departure, the Romans&nbsp;made their submission, and the treaty of October was subscribed on the 15th May 1405. Nevertheless, as it only&nbsp;bears the signatures of the “seven governors of the liberty&nbsp;of the Roman republic,” the pope would seem to have&nbsp;made some concessions. His position was by no means&nbsp;assured. Ladislaus was known to aspire to absolute&nbsp;dominion in Italy, and, although willing to aid in suppressing the republic, tried to prepare the way for his own&nbsp;designs, and frequently held out a helping hand to the&nbsp;vanquished. On the 6th August fourteen influential&nbsp;citizens of Rome boldly presented themselves at the Vatican,&nbsp;and in a threatening manner called the pope to account for&nbsp;giving his whole attention to worldly things, instead of&nbsp;endeavouring to put a stop to the schisms of the church.&nbsp;But, on leaving his presence, they were attacked by Luigi&nbsp;Migliorati, the pope’s nephew, and notorious for his&nbsp;violence, who killed eleven of their number, including&nbsp;several heads of the regions and two of the governors.&nbsp;An insurrection ensued, and the pope and his nephew&nbsp;fled to Viterbo. The Colonna tried to profit by these&nbsp;events, and applied to Ladislaus, who, hoping that the&nbsp;moment had come to make himself master of Rome, sent&nbsp;the count of Troia thither with a troop of three thousand&nbsp;horse. But the people, enraged by this treachery, and&nbsp;determined not to fall under the yoke of Naples, awoke&nbsp;for an instant to the memory of their past glories, and&nbsp;bravely repulsed the Colonna and the Neapolitans. And,&nbsp;on the speedy arrival of the Orsini with some of the papal&nbsp;troops, the people voluntarily restored the papal government, and, assembling the parliament, besought the pope to&nbsp;return on his own terms. Accordingly, after first naming&nbsp;Francesco Panciatichi of Pistoia to the senatorship, the pope&nbsp;came back on the 13th March 1406, bringing his whole&nbsp;curia with him, and also the murderer Migliorati, who,&nbsp;triumphing in impunity, became more arrogant than before.&nbsp;Here indeed was a proof that the Romans were no longer&nbsp;worthy of liberty ! And now, by means of the Orsini,&nbsp;Innocent had only to reduce the Colonna and other nobles&nbsp;raised to power by Ladislaus ; nor was this very difficult,&nbsp;seeing that the king, in his usual fashion, abandoned them&nbsp;to their fate, and, making terms with the pope, was named&nbsp;gonfalonier of the church and again protected her cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Innocent, dying in 1406, was succeeded by Gregory XII., a Venetian, who, as we shall presently see, resigned the&nbsp;chair in 1415. On his accession, finding his state firmly&nbsp;established, he seemed to be seriously bent on putting an&nbsp;end to the Great Schism, and for that purpose arranged a&nbsp;meeting with the antipope Benedict XIII. at the congress&nbsp;of Savona in 1408. But Gregory and Benedict only used&nbsp;the congress as a pretext for making war upon each other,&nbsp;and were urged on by Ladislaus, who hoped by Aveakening&nbsp;both to gain possession of Rome, where, although opposed&nbsp;by the Orsini, he had the support of the Colonna.&nbsp;Gregory, who had then fled from Rome, made a momentary&nbsp;attempt to win the popular favour by restoring the government of the banderesi ; but Ladislaus marched into Rome&nbsp;in June 1408 and established a senator of his oavπ.&nbsp;Meanwhile the two popes were continuing their shameful&nbsp;struggle, and the council of Pisa (March 1409), in attempting to check it, only succeeded in raising up a third pontiff,&nbsp;first in the person of Alexander V. (1409-10), and then&nbsp;in the turbulent Baldassare Cossa, who assumed the name&nbsp;of John XXIII. The latter began by sending a large&nbsp;contingent to assist Louis of Anjou against Ladislaus.&nbsp;But the enterprise failed, and, seeing himself deserted by&nbsp;all, Pope John next embraced the cause of his foe by</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
