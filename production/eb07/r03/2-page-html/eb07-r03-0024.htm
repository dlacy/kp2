<p><span class="font0">Dr Rush’s numerous publications obtained him many marks of respect from his contemporaries, and procured him&nbsp;admission, as an honorary member, into the most distinguished literary and philosophical societies of Europe. His name&nbsp;was familiar to the medical world as the Sydenham of&nbsp;America. His accurate observations and correct discrimination of epidemic diseases well entitled him to this distinction ; while, in the original energy of his reasoning, he&nbsp;far excelled his prototype. His literary and professional&nbsp;character, indeed, appears to have been greatly influenced&nbsp;by the moral and political sentiments which were prevalent&nbsp;in his day. A love of innovation led him to that proud&nbsp;defiance of established authority which is just as likely to&nbsp;be pernicious as to be salutary.· The study of the learned&nbsp;languages he depreciated, in one of his early essays, as&nbsp;unfit for a republican education ; and this was the first&nbsp;step to the true Jacobin doctrine, that it was unrepublican&nbsp;and aristocratical to have received any education whatever. In physic, his rejection of the prejudices of antiquity&nbsp;was somewhat more consistent with moderation, and the&nbsp;reform that he attempted was occasionally more successful than his literary speculations ; nor can it be denied that&nbsp;there are a multitude of original suggestions in his works,&nbsp;which may very probably be found capable of affording&nbsp;valuable hints to the lovers of medical experiments.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RUSHWORTH, </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">John</span><span class="font0">, the compiler of some very useful historical collections, was born in Northumberland about the year 1607, being descended of honourable ancestors.&nbsp;After attending the university of Oxford for some time,&nbsp;he removed to Lincoln’s Inn ; but the study of the law not&nbsp;suiting his genius, he soon deserted it, in order to seek a&nbsp;situation where he might more easily gratify his love for&nbsp;political information. He frequently attended the meetings&nbsp;of parliament, and wrote down the speeches both of the&nbsp;king and members. During the space of eleven years from&nbsp;1630 to 1640, when no parliament was held, he was an attentive observer of the great transactions of state in the&nbsp;star-chamber, the court of honour, and exchequer chamber, when all the judges of England assembled there on&nbsp;cases of great emergency. Nor did he neglect to observe&nbsp;with a watchful eye those events which happened at a distance from the capital. He visited the camp at Berwick,&nbsp;and was present at the battle of Newborn, at the treaty of&nbsp;Ripon, and at the great council of York.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1640 he was appointed assistant to Henry Elsynge, clerk to the House of Commons, and thus had the best&nbsp;opportunities of being acquainted with their debates and&nbsp;proceedings. The Commons considered him as a person&nbsp;worthy of confidence ; and, in particular, they trusted him&nbsp;with carrying their messages to the king whilst he remained at York. And when the parliament created Sir Thomas&nbsp;Fairfax their general, Rushworth was appointed his secretary, and discharged the office much to the advantage of his&nbsp;master. When Fairfax resigned his commission, his secretary returned to Lincoln’s Inn, and was soon afterwards (in&nbsp;1651-52) chosen one of the committee that was appointed&nbsp;to deliberate concerning the propriety and means of altering or new-modelling the common law. He was elected&nbsp;one of the representatives for Berwick-upon-Tweed to the&nbsp;parliament which Richard Cromwell assembled in 1658,&nbsp;and was re-elected by the same town to the parliament&nbsp;which restored Charles II. to the crown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">After the Restoration, he delivered to the king several books of the privy-council, which he had preserved in his&nbsp;own possession during the commotions which then agitated&nbsp;the country. Sir Orlando Bridgeman, keeper of the great&nbsp;seal, chose him his secretary in the year 1677, an office which&nbsp;he enjoyed as long as Sir Orlando kept the seals. In 1678&nbsp;he was a third time chosen member for Berwick, and a fourth&nbsp;time in the ensuing parliament in 1679. He was also a&nbsp;member of the parliament which was convened at Oxford.&nbsp;The different offices he had held afforded him favourable&nbsp;opportunities of acquiring a fortune, or at least an indcpen-denee ; yet, whether from negligence or prodigality, he&nbsp;was never possessed of wealth. Having run himself into&nbsp;debt, he was arrested and committed to the King’s Bench&nbsp;prison, Southwark, where he lingered for the last six years&nbsp;of his life in the most deplorable condition. His memory&nbsp;and judgment were much impaired, partly by age and partly&nbsp;by the too frequent use of spirituous liquors. He died on&nbsp;the l2th of May 1690.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His Historical Collections of private Passages in State, weighty Matters in Law, and remarkable Proceedings in&nbsp;Parliament, were published in folio at different times. The&nbsp;first part, comprehending the years between 1618 and 1629,&nbsp;appeared in 1659. The copy had been intrusted by Oliver Cromwell to Whitelock, with instructions to peruse and&nbsp;examine it. Upon perusing it, he thought it necessary to&nbsp;make some alterations and additions. The second part was&nbsp;published in 1680 ; the third in 1692 ; the fourth and last,&nbsp;which comes down to the year 1648, was published in 1701 ;&nbsp;and altogether they made seven volumes. These underwent a second edition in 1721 ; and the trial of the Earl of&nbsp;Strafford was added, which made the eighth. This work&nbsp;has been much applauded by those who condemn the conduct of Charles I., and accused of partiality by those who&nbsp;favour the cause of that unhappy monarch. One person&nbsp;in particular, Dr John Nelson of Cambridge, in a Collection of the Affairs of State, published by the command of&nbsp;Charles II., undertook to prove that Rushworth has concealed truth, endeavoured to vindicate the prevailing detractions of the times, as well as their barbarous actions,&nbsp;and with a kind of rebound to libel the government at second hand. But this accusation seems to be carried too&nbsp;far. His principles indeed led him to show the king and&nbsp;his adherents in an unfavourable light, and to vindicate&nbsp;the proceedings of parliament ; yet it cannot justly be affirmed that he has misrepresented or falsified any of the&nbsp;speeches or facts which he has admitted into his collection.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
