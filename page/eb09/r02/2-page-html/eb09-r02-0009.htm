<p><span class="font0">piece (fig 4). From seven to nine of these ribs have ossified sternal ribs which serve to connect them with the sternum.&nbsp;The lumbar vertebræ have only</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">long transverse processes which</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">arise above the neuro-central</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">suture. The sacral vertebræ</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">support very stout transverse</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">processes, each of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">which includes a rib</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">element and becomes</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">anchylosed to the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">centra only at a late</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">period of life, as do</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the comparatively</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">long and slender</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">caudal transverse</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">processes. Inferior</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">processes, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hypapo-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">physes,</span><span class="font0"> which are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">azygous, descend one</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">from beneath the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">centrum of each of the more posterior cervical and anterior dorsal vertebræ.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sternum consists of an ossified rhomboidal plate, with the hinder side of which two pairs of costal cartilages&nbsp;articulate. A narrower piece extends backwards from&nbsp;this plate (connected with it by ligament), and ends in two&nbsp;diverging processes. With this the other sternal ribs&nbsp;articulate. A long slender bone, the interclavicle, or&nbsp;episternum, lies in a median groove of the sternal plate,&nbsp;and extends forwards beyond it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is a so-called abdominal sternum made up of a series of seven or eight slender bones which lie in the&nbsp;aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle of the abdomen&nbsp;behind the true sternum and in front of the pelvis. It&nbsp;lies at a lower level than the sternum, and has no direct&nbsp;connexion with the vertebral column.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria,</span><span class="font0"> the only living member of the order </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rhynchocephalia,</span><span class="font0"> as well as in the extinct species, the&nbsp;vertebral bodies have flat or concave surfaces in front and&nbsp;behind. There are 8 cervical, 14 dorsal, 3 lumbar, 2 sacral,&nbsp;and 36 caudal vertebræ. There is no persistent neurocentral suture in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria,</span><span class="font0"> though there may be in some&nbsp;extinct forms of the order. Rudiments of the proatlas are&nbsp;sometimes present. The atlas consists but of three pieces,&nbsp;and the odontoid bone is anchylosed with the atlas, and&nbsp;is concave anteriorly. An autogenous hypapophysis is&nbsp;wedged into the inferior interspace between the centrum&nbsp;of the axis and the third vertebræ, and similar parts are&nbsp;developed thence backwards to beneath the seventh and&nbsp;eighth vertebræ. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria</span><span class="font0"> has the faculty of reproducing&nbsp;its tail after mutilation. When the tail is broken the&nbsp;fracture takes place in the middle of one of its centra and&nbsp;not between two adjacent centra. This is owing to the&nbsp;fact that each caudal vertebra is divided into an anterior&nbsp;and a posterior part (fig. 5),</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and is weakest at this line of junction which passes behind&nbsp;the transverse process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The first rib is attached to the fourth vertebra. Those&nbsp;of the ninth and the following&nbsp;vertebræ attain the sternum.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The more posterior ribs become connected with the abdominal sternum. All the ribs are single at their proximal ends, a bifurcation being scarcely indicated even at the&nbsp;most anterior one. Processus uncinati are fully developed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sternum is a rhomboidal, semi-cartilaginous plate, with a medianly situated long and slender episternum which&nbsp;unites with a pair of clavicles. An abdominal sternum is&nbsp;more fully developed than in any other living Reptile. It&nbsp;consists of about twenty-five transverse rods, each of&nbsp;which is composed of three pieces. These rods are connected and disconnected with the ribs in an alternate&nbsp;manner, every other rod being suspended from a pair of&nbsp;the true ribs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Lacertilia.—</span><span class="font0">In this extensive order of living Reptiles, the vertebræ are procœlous except in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Geckotidæ</span><span class="font0"> and&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uropeltidæ,</span><span class="font0"> where they are biconcave. There may or may&nbsp;not be distinct cervical, lumbar, and sacral regions, and the&nbsp;number of vertebræ, generally considerable, may be very&nbsp;large. The distinctness of the vertebral regions depends&nbsp;on the development of the anterior and posterior limbs.&nbsp;When a cervical region can be distinguished, there are&nbsp;never more than nine such vertebræ. Only in rare&nbsp;instances are there distinct lumbar vertebræ. The sacral&nbsp;vertebræ are never more than two. The neural arch is&nbsp;always anchylosed to the centrum in adults. The atlas&nbsp;consists of three parts, and the axis may or may not have&nbsp;the odontoid bone anchylosed to it and convex in front.&nbsp;Ribs are attached to most of the cervical as well as to the&nbsp;dorsal vertebræ ; but the former are not expanded distally&nbsp;as in the Crocodile, and thus the latter do not support&nbsp;uncinate processes. The more anterior ribs show two&nbsp;proximal articular surfaces, but these never diverge into&nbsp;distinct capitular and tubercular processes as in the Crocodiles, nor, as in the latter, do any of the dorsal vertebræ&nbsp;develop double, superimposed transverse processes. The&nbsp;more anterior (usually the first three or four) dorsal ribs&nbsp;are connected with the sternum by sternal cartilages.&nbsp;Those behind may be similarly connected with the diverging backward prolongations of the sternum, or may be&nbsp;directly connected with their fellows of the opposite side,&nbsp;as in the Chamæleon, a median cartilage being joined on&nbsp;either side by the sternal cartilage continuous with an&nbsp;ossified rib. In </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Acontias</span><span class="font0"> and other limbless Lacertilians&nbsp;which have but a rudimentary sternum, or none, the corresponding ribs of the right and left sides are connected&nbsp;across the mid-ventral line as they are in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chamæleo.</span><span class="font0"> In&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Draco</span><span class="font0"> the more posterior ribs are greatly prolonged, and&nbsp;their distal cartilages are bent backwards. This is to&nbsp;enable them to support the wing-like membrane which&nbsp;extends from either side of the body to serve as a&nbsp;parachute. In those Lizards which have a lumbar region,&nbsp;transverse processes are there developed. The caudal&nbsp;vertebræ (except the most anterior and the small posterior&nbsp;ones) have chevron bones, which are not generally anchylosed to the vertebræ which support them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the ordinary articular processes, there are in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iguana</span><span class="font0"> certain accessory articulating structures such as&nbsp;are commonly found in the vertebræ of Serpents; these will&nbsp;be described in the next section.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The sternum consists of a rhomboidal semi-ossified or cartilaginous plate, which is sometimes continued backwards into a pair of long diverging processes. There is&nbsp;generally an episternum, which is often T-shaped, but it&nbsp;may be absent, as in Chamaeleons. In the limbless Lizards&nbsp;the sternum is cartilaginous, and there is none whatever in&nbsp;some forms, as, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font0"> in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amphisbæna</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Typhline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In many Lizards, notably in the commonest English Lizard, the tail if broken off can be reproduced. In them&nbsp;the centra of the caudal vertebræ have a vertical median&nbsp;division similar to that already described in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Hatteria.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In Ophidians the number of vertebræ is generally very large, and may exceed four hundred. They are all procœlous, and the ball behind each is nearly hemispherical. There&nbsp;is no distinction of cervical, lumbar, or sacral vertebræ;&nbsp;but all the vertebræ after the atlas may be considered as&nbsp;either dorsal or caudal. The mode of articulation between&nbsp;the vertebræ is more complex than in almost any Lizards.</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
