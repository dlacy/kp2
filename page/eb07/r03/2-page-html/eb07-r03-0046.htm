<p><span class="font0">Turks, and to make an inroad into Moldavia. Forgetting his usual prudence and circumspection, Peter crossed the&nbsp;Dnieper, and advanced by rapid marches as far as Yassy or&nbsp;Jassy, the capital of that province, which is situated on&nbsp;the river Pruth ; but his temerity had nearly cost him his&nbsp;liberty, if not his life. The particulars of his dangerous&nbsp;situation, with the manner in which he ⅜<sup>r</sup>as extricated from&nbsp;it by the prudent counsel of his consort Catherine, and the&nbsp;treaty of the Pruth<sub>1</sub> which was the result of that counsel,&nbsp;have been already related under the head of Cathebine I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By this treaty, in which the interests of Charles had been almost abandoned, Peter saw himself delivered from a dangerous enemy, and returned to his capital to prosecute&nbsp;those plans for the internal improvement of his empire&nbsp;which justly entitled him to the appellation of Great. Before we enumerate these improvements, however, we must&nbsp;bring the Swedish war to a conclusion. The death of&nbsp;Charles, in 1718, had left the Swedish government deplorably weakened, by the continual drains of men and money&nbsp;occasioned by his mad enterprises, and little able to carry&nbsp;on a war with a monarch so powerful as Peter. At length,&nbsp;therefore, in 1721, this ruinous contest, which had continued ever since the commencement of the century, was&nbsp;brought to a conclusion by the treaty of Nystadt<sub>1</sub> by which&nbsp;the Swedes were obliged to cede to Russia, Livonia, Es-thonia, Ingria, a part of Karelia, the territory of Vyborg, the&nbsp;isle of Oesel, and all the other islands in the Baltic, from&nbsp;Courland to Vyborg ; for which concessions they received&nbsp;back Finland, that had been conquered by Peter, together&nbsp;with two millions of dollars, and the liberty of exporting duty&nbsp;free, from Riga, Revel, and Arensberg, com to the annual&nbsp;amount of fifty thousand roubles. In consequence of this&nbsp;great accession to the Russian empire, Peter received from&nbsp;his senate the title of Emperor and Autocrat of all the Rus-sias, and the ancient title of czar fell into disuse.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The improvements introduced by Peter into the internal policy of the empire must be acknowledged to have been&nbsp;numerous and important. He organized anew the legislative assembly of the state ; he greatly ameliorated the administration of justice ; he new-modelled the national army ;&nbsp;he entirely created the Russian navy ; he rendered the ecclesiastical government milder and less intolerant ; he zealously&nbsp;patronized the arts and sciences ; he erected an observatory&nbsp;at St Petersburg, and by publicly proclaiming the approach&nbsp;of an eclipse, and the precise time at which it was to take&nbsp;place, taught his subjects no longer to consider such a phenomenon as an omen of disaster, or an awful menace of divine judgment. He enlarged the commerce of his empire,&nbsp;and gave every encouragement to trade and manufactures.&nbsp;He formed canals, repaired the roads, instituted regular&nbsp;posts, and laid down regulations for a uniformity of weights&nbsp;and measures. Lastly, he in some measure civilized his&nbsp;subjects, though it is evident that he could not civilize himself.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Various have been the estimates formed of the character of Peter by those who have detailed the events of his reign.&nbsp;It is certain that to him the Russian empire is indebted for&nbsp;much of that splendour with which it now shines among the&nbsp;powers of Europe. As a monarch, therefore, he is entitled&nbsp;to our admiration ; but as a private individual we must consider him as an object of detestation and abhorrence. His&nbsp;tyranny and his cruelty admit of no excuse ; and if we were&nbsp;to suppose, that in sacrificing the heir of his crown he emulated the patriotism of the elder Brutus, we must remember&nbsp;that the same hand which signed tile death-warrant of his&nbsp;son, could with pleasure execute the sentence of the law,&nbsp;or rather of his own caprice, and, in the moments of dissipation and revelry, could make the axe of justice an instrument of diabolical vengeance or of cool brutality.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Peter was succeeded by his consort Catherine, in whose favour he had, some years before his death, altered the order of succession. As the character of this princess, and&nbsp;the transactions of her short reign, have been fully detailed&nbsp;under her life, we shall here only notice in the most cur- ■&nbsp;sory manner the events that took place. From the com-,&nbsp;mencement of her reign, Catherine conducted herself with&nbsp;the greatest benignity and gentleness, and thus secured the&nbsp;love and veneration of her subjects, which she had acquired&nbsp;during the life of the emperor. She reduced the annual&nbsp;capitation tax ; ordered the numerous gibbets which Peter&nbsp;had erected in various parts of the country to be cut down ;&nbsp;and caused the bodies of those who had fallen victims to&nbsp;his tyranny to be decently interred. She recalled the greater&nbsp;part of those whom Peter had exiled to Siberia ; paid the&nbsp;troops their arrears ; and restored to the Kozaks those privileges and immunities of which they had been deprived&nbsp;during the late reign, while she continued in office most of&nbsp;the servants of Peter, both civil and military. In her reign&nbsp;the boundaries of the empire were extended by the submission of a Georgian prince, and the voluntary homage of the&nbsp;Kubinskian Tartars. She died on the 17th of May 1727,&nbsp;having reigned about two years. She had settled the crown&nbsp;on Peter the son of the Czarovitch Alexei, who succeeded&nbsp;by the title of Peter II.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Peter was only twelve years of age when he ascended tile imperial throne, and his reign was short and uninteresting· He was guided chiefly by Prince MenzikofF, whose&nbsp;daughter Catherine had decreed him to marry. This ambitious man, who, from the mean condition of a pye-boy,&nbsp;had risen to the first offices of the state, and had, during&nbsp;the late reign, principally conducted the administration of&nbsp;the government, was now, however, drawing towards the&nbsp;end of his career. The number of his enemies had greatly&nbsp;increased, and their attempts to work his downfall at last&nbsp;succeeded. A young nobleman of the family of the Dol-goruki, who was one of Peter’s chief companions, was excited by his relations, and the other enemies of MenzikofF,&nbsp;to instil into the mind of the young prince feelings hostile&nbsp;to that minister. In this commission he succeeded so well,&nbsp;that MenzikofFand his whole family, not excepting the young&nbsp;empress, were banished to Siberia, and the Dolgorukis took&nbsp;into their hands the management of affairs. These artful&nbsp;counsellors, instead of cultivating the naturally good abilities&nbsp;of Peter, encouraged him to waste his time and exhaust his&nbsp;strength in hunting and other athletic exercises, ∙fbr which&nbsp;his tender years were by no means calculated. It is supposed that the debility consequent on such fatigue increased&nbsp;the natural danger of the small-pox, with which he was attacked in January 1730, and from which he never recovered.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Notwithstanding the absolute power with which Peter I. and the Empress Catherine had settled by will the title&nbsp;to the throne, the Russian senate and nobility, upon the&nbsp;death of Peter II. ventured to set aside the order of succession which those sovereigns had established. The male&nbsp;issue of Peter was now extinct ; and the Duke of Holstein,&nbsp;son to Peter’s eldest daughter, was by the destination of&nbsp;the late empress entitled to the crown ; but the Russians,&nbsp;for political reasons, filled the throne with Anne duchess&nbsp;of Courland, second daughter to Ivan, the eldest brother of&nbsp;Peter, though her eldest sister, the Duchess of Mecklenburg, was still alive. Anne’s reign was extremely prosperous; and though she accepted the crown under limitations which some thought derogatory to her dignity, yet&nbsp;she broke them all, asserted the prerogative of her ancestors, and punished the aspiring Dolgoruki family, who had&nbsp;imposed those restrictions, with a view, as it is said, that&nbsp;they themselves might govern. She raised her favourite&nbsp;Biren to the duchy of Courland ; and was obliged to give&nbsp;way to many severe executions on his account- Few transactions of any importance took place during the reign of&nbsp;Anne. She followed the example of her great predecessor&nbsp;Peter, by interposing in the affairs of Poland, where she</span></p>
