<p><span class="font0">framing, usually of rough northern pine or spruce, is generally hidden from view by the ceilings. The spans usually are not&nbsp;great, and extra support is obtained at various&nbsp;points from partitions and cross walls. Where the&nbsp;span is large, that is, above 20 ft. without intermediate&nbsp;support, it is necessary to employ roofs with “ principals ” and “ purlins,” sometimes called “ double&nbsp;rafter roofs.” Principals are strong trusses of timber&nbsp;rigidly framed together and placed at intervals of about&nbsp;10 ft. to support the weight of the roof covering.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Purlins—stout timbers running longitudinally—are</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">fixed on the principal rafters with intervals of about 8 ft., and on these the common rafters are fastened. Principals, or&nbsp;“ roof trusses ” as they are more often called, are framed&nbsp;together in various ways, and the members may be entirely&nbsp;of wood or reinforced by ties of iron rods or bars; the latter&nbsp;are called “ composite trusses.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The “ king-post truss ” may be used for spans up to 30 ft. and is constructed as shown in figs. 1 and 2. It has a central&nbsp;post sustaining the “ tie-beam ” in the centre with struts projecting from its base to support the principal rafters at their&nbsp;centres at a point where the weight of the purlins renders&nbsp;strutting necessary. The members are connected by wrought-iron straps and bolts; the strap connects the king-post and&nbsp;tie-beam and is often fitted with a gib-and-cotter arrangement&nbsp;(really a pair of iron folding wedges) which allows the whole&nbsp;truss to be tightened up should any settlement or shrinkage&nbsp;occur. “ Queen-post trusses ” have, in place of the king-post&nbsp;dividing the tie-beam into two, two queen-posts supporting&nbsp;it at two points (fig. 3). The joints</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">between the members are made in a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">similar manner to those of the king</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">post principal with wrought-iron straps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The purlins are two in number on each</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">slope, one supported at the top of each</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">“ queen,” the other half-w<sup>T</sup>ay between that</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">point and the wall-plate and resting upon</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the principal rafter at a point where</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">strutted from the base of the queen-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">post. A stout straining beam connects</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the heads of the queens. In fig. 4, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">b</span><span class="font0"> are details at the foot of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">queen-post, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font0"> at the head. Trusses</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of this type are suitable for spans up to</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">45 ft. In. roofs of a larger span than</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">this and up to 60 ft. the tie-beam requires</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">to be upheld at more than two points,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and additional posts called “ princesses ”</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">are introduced for this purpose. This</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">also entails extra struts and purlins.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In such large spans the straining beam often becomes of such a length as to require support and this is effected by continuing the principal&nbsp;rafters up to the ridge&nbsp;and introducing a&nbsp;short king-post to&nbsp;sustain the beam in&nbsp;the middle of its</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">length.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Open timber roofs of various types but&nbsp;principally&nbsp;of “ hammer - beam ”&nbsp;construction were used&nbsp;in the middle ages&nbsp;where stone vaulting was not employed. Many of&nbsp;these old roofs still&nbsp;exist in good preservation and exhibit&nbsp;the great skill of the&nbsp;medieval carpenters&nbsp;who designed and&nbsp;erected them. Such&nbsp;forms are still used,&nbsp;chiefly for ecclesiastical buildings and&nbsp;the roofs over large&nbsp;halls. In the best&nbsp;periods of Gothic&nbsp;architecture the pitch</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">of these roofs was made very steep, sometimes as much as 6o° with the horizon. In the hammer-beam type of&nbsp;roof the tie-beam at the foot of the rafters is omitted, a&nbsp;collar being thrown across connecting the principal rafters at&nbsp;a point about half-way in their length, the lower portion&nbsp;of the principal consisting of a number of struts and&nbsp;braces rigidly connected in“ such a manner as to throw as&nbsp;little thrust as possible upon the walls serving as abutments.&nbsp;There are two kinds of hammer beams, the arched and the&nbsp;bracketed; the chief examples are Westminster Hall and&nbsp;Middle Temple Hall (Plate I. figs. 24 and 25). The&nbsp;“ hammer beam ” projects from the top of the wall and is&nbsp;bracketed from a corbel projecting from the wall some&nbsp;distance below. This form of roof has a style and dignity&nbsp;of its own, and gives greater height in the upper part of&nbsp;the building as well as being more ornamental and lighter&nbsp;in effect than tie-beam trusses, which have a rather heavy&nbsp;effect.</span></p>
