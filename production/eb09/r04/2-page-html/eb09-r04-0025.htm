                    (twenty-six&nbsp;of them in Poland) showed a production valued at 11 S,
                    888,530&nbsp;roubles in 1882. Tobacco is cultivated everywhere, but good
                    qualities are obtained only in the south. In 1876-80 an average area&nbsp;of
                    101,600 acres was under this steadily increasing culture, and the&nbsp;crop of
                    1884 yielded 86,400,000 cwts. The vine, which might be&nbsp;grown much farther
                    north than at present, is cultivated only on&nbsp;Mount Caucasus, in Bessarabia,
                    in the Crimea, and on the lower&nbsp;Don for wine, and in Ekaterinoslaff,
                    Podolia, and Astrakhan for&nbsp;raisins. The yearly produce is 10<sup>-</sup>8

                    in the United States. They are kept in largest&nbsp;numbers in the three Steppe

                    ; these are&nbsp;mostly of a very poor description. Infectious diseases make
                    great&nbsp;ravages every year. In 1882 no less than 121,500 cattle

                    engaged in fishing on the Norwegian coast and in&nbsp;the White Sea, the
                    aggregate yield of this industry being estimated&nbsp;at 200,000 cwts.,
                    including 150 million herrings. These fisheries&nbsp;are, however, declining.
                    Fishing in the Baltic is not of much&nbsp;importance. In the estuaries of the
                    Dnieper, Dniester, and Bug&nbsp;it gives occupation to about 4000 men, and may
                    be valued at less&nbsp;than 1,000,000 roubles. The fisheries in the Sea of
                    Azoff, which&nbsp;occupy about 15,000 men, are much more important, as are
                    also&nbsp;those of the lower Don, which last alone are valued at
                    over&nbsp;1,000,000 roubles a year. The chief fisheries of Russia are, however,
                    on the Caspian and in its feeders : those of the Volga cover&nbsp;no less than

                    sea-coast and 400 miles up the river. The&nbsp;lowest estimates give no less
                    than 4 million cwts., valued at 15&nbsp;million roubles, of fish taken every
                    year in the Caspian and its&nbsp;affluents. The fisheries on the lakes of the

                    two-thirds of the consumption) was stated as follows,&nbsp;(in thousands of
                    cwts.):—Urals, 6153; central Russia, 1092;&nbsp;Olonetz, 42 ; south and
                    south-west Russia, 501 ; Poland, 951 ;&nbsp;Finland, 413 ; Siberia, 85. The iron

                    observable since 1863. About that time a thorough reform&nbsp;of the machinery
                    in use was effected, whereby the number of hands&nbsp;employed was reduced, but
                    the yearly production doubled or&nbsp;trebled. In some branches the production

                    corresponding rate of progress in manufacturing productivity in western Europe
                    be taken into account. Besides, since the great improvements of 1861-70 the
                    industrial progress of Russia has been but slow.&nbsp;The manufactories of rails
                    and railway plan t, and even the Ural ironworks, are in a precarious condition.
                    The textile industries, though&nbsp;undoubtedly they have made great advances,
                    are subject to great&nbsp;fluctuations in connexion with those of the home
                    crops, and are thus&nbsp;in an abnormal state. The artisans labour for twelve,
                    fourteen, and&nbsp;sometimes sixteen hours a day, and their condition, as
                    revealed by&nbsp;recent inquiries, is very unsatisfactory. Many causes
                    contribute to&nbsp;this,—the want of technical instruction, the want of capital,
