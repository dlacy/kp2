His father was a stuff weaver, and, intending to bring his son up to his own business, took little care of the boy’s education. Young Simpson, however, was eager for knowledge, and so ardent was he in pursuit of it that he neglected his weaving, and in consequence of a quarrel was forced to leave his father’s house. He settled</p><pb xml:id="eb09-22-s04-0087" facs="encyclopediabrit22newyrich_raw_0103.jp2"/><p>for a short time at Nuneaton, where he met a pedlar who practised fortune-telling. By the encouragement and assistance of this man Simpson was induced to make a profession of casting nativities himself, and he soon became the oracle of the neighbourhood. But he was not long in discovering the imposture of astrology, and his conscience, as well as an accident which happened to him in the practice of his art, compelled him to abandon this profession. After a residence of two or three years at Derby, where he worked as a weaver during the day and taught pupils in the evenings, he went up to London and pursued the same course, but with more success. The number of his pupils increased ; his abilities became more widely known ; and he was enabled to publish by subscription his <hi rend="italic">Treatise of Fluxions</hi> in 1737. His treatise, as was afterwards acknowledged, abounded with errors of the press, and contained several obscurities and defects incidental to the author’s want of experience and the disadvantages under which he laboured. His next publications were <hi rend="italic">A Treatise on the Nature and Laws of Chance,</hi> 1740; <hi rend="italic">Essays on Several Curious and Useful Subjects in Speculative and Mixed Mathematicks,</hi> 1740 ; <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine of Annuities and Reversions deduced from General and Evident Principles,</hi> 1742; and <hi rend="italic">Mathematical Dissertations on a Variety of Physical and Analytical Subjects,</hi> 1743. Soon after the publication of his <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi> he was chosen a member of the Royal Academy at Stockholm ; in 1743 he was appointed professor of mathematics in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich ; and in 1745 he was admitted a fellow of the Royal Society of London. In 1745 he published <hi rend="italic">A Treatise of Algebra,</hi> with an appendix containing the construction of geometrical problems, and in 1747 the <hi rend="italic">Elements of Plane Geometry.</hi> The latter book, unlike many others with the same title, is not an edition of Euclid’s <hi rend="italic">Elements,</hi> but an independent treatise. Though it can hardly be said that as an introduction to geometry it is preferable to Euclid, yet the solutions of problems contained in it (and in the appendix to the <hi rend="italic">Algebra</hi> as well) are in general exceedingly ingenious. In his <hi rend="italic">Trigonometry, Plane and Spherical, with the Construction and Application of Logarithms,</hi> which appeared in 1748, there is a tolerably uniform use of contractions for the words sine, tangent, &amp;amp;c., prefixed to the symbol of the angle. <hi rend="italic">The Doctrine and Application of Fluxions,</hi> which he issued in 1750, was more full and comprehensive than his earlier work on the same subject, and altogether was so different that he wished it to be considered as a new book and not as a second edition of the former. In 1752 appeared <hi rend="italic">Select Exercises for Young Proficients in the Mathematicks,</hi> and in 1757 his <hi rend="italic">Miscellaneous Tracts on Some Curious and Very Interesting Subjects in Mechanics, Physical Astronomy, and Speculative Mathematics,</hi> the last and perhaps the greatest of all his works. From the year 1735 he had sometimes under his own name, sometimes under fictitious names, been a frequent contributor to the <hi rend="italic">Ladies' Diary,</hi> an annual publication partly devoted to the solution of mathematical problems, and from 1754 till 1760 inclusive he was the editor of it. From first to last Simpson seems to have had his own share of the cares and anxieties of this world, and it is astonishing how under such circumstances he contrived to accomplish what he did. His unremitting application and the want of proper regimen gradually undermined his health, and he died on the 14th of May 1761 at his native village. His name will probably be considered the most illustrious in the long roll of the non-academical mathematicians of Britain.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
