<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Mediæval and Modern History of Walachia and Moldavia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roumania is the name officially adopted by the united kingdom that comprises the former principalities of Walachia and JIoldavia.&nbsp;Inits native form it appears simply as “Romania,” representing&nbsp;the claim to Roman descent put forward by its inhabitants. These&nbsp;call themselves “ Romani ” or “ Rumeni, ” but by their neighbours,&nbsp;Slavonic, Greek, Magyar, and German, they are universally known&nbsp;by one or other form of the word “ Vlach.” As, however, this&nbsp;Vlach or Rouman race occupies a far wider area than that included&nbsp;in the present Roumanian kingdom, it may be convenient to postpone the vexed questions connected with its origin, migrations,&nbsp;and distribution for more general treatment under the heading&nbsp;Vlachs, and to confine ourselves on this occasion to Roumania&nbsp;proper—the country between the Carpathians, the Lower Danube,&nbsp;and the Black Sea. It may be sufficient here to observe that,&nbsp;according to the concurrent accounts from various sources, the&nbsp;great plains of the later Walachian and Moldavian principalities&nbsp;were first occupied by an immigrant Rouman population coming&nbsp;from the Carpathian lands and the present Transylvania in the&nbsp;early Middle Ages. According to the Russian Nestor and the&nbsp;earliest Hungarian chroniclers, the Carpathian region, including&nbsp;tracts of eastern Hungary, were occupied by a Rouman (“ Roman ”)&nbsp;population at the time of the Magyar invasion in the 9th century.&nbsp;On the other hand, the meagre annals of the plains that lie on&nbsp;the left bank of the Lower Danube are exclusively occupied till at&nbsp;least the Ilth century with Slovenes, Petchenegs, Cumans, and&nbsp;Bulgarians. Whatever title the Carpathian Roumans may have&nbsp;to be considered the descendants </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">in situ</span><span class="font0"> of the Romanized provincials of Trajan’s Dacia, it seems fairly ascertained that the&nbsp;present extension of this easternmost branch of the Latin peoples&nbsp;over the Walachian and JIoldavian plains is due to a colonizing&nbsp;movement from the Alpine regions to the west, effected for the&nbsp;most part in the 12th and succeeding centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Walaehia.—</span><span class="font0">For the early history of the Walachian (Valachian, or Wallachian) principality the native sources are late and untrustworthy. These sources really reduce themselves to a single chronicle, a part of which appears to have been drawn up in the 16th&nbsp;century in Bulgaro-Slovene, and of which two Rouman translations&nbsp;have seen the light. This “History of the Rouman land since&nbsp;the arrival of the Roumans ” </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">[Istoria tierei Romanesei de cândii au&nbsp;desealicata Rornanii)</span><span class="font0"> gives a precise account of the founding of the&nbsp;Walachian state by Radul Negru, voivode of the Roumans of&nbsp;Fogaras in Transylvania, who in 1290 descended with a numerous&nbsp;people into the Transalpine plain and established his capital first&nbsp;at Cimpulungu and then at Argish. Radul dies in 1314 and is&nbsp;succeeded by a series of voivodes whose names and dates are duly&nbsp;given ; but this early chapter of Walachian history has been&nbsp;rudely handled by Roesler in his essay on the oldest history of the&nbsp;Walachian voivodeship </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">[Romanische Studien,</span><span class="font0"> p. 261 </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sq. ). </span><span class="font0">The so-called “ Chronicle of Hurul ” is a modern forgery, and our only real&nbsp;authorities for the beginnings of Roumanianhistoryare Hungarian,&nbsp;Polish, and Byzantine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1330 the voivode Alexander Bazarad or Bassaraba succeeded in inflicting a crushing defeat on his suzerain King Charles of&nbsp;Hungary, and for fourteen years Wallachia enjoyed complete independence. Louis the Great succeeded for a while in restoring the&nbsp;Hungarian supremacy, but in 1367 the voivode Vlad or Vladislav&nbsp;inflicted another severe defeat on the Hungarians, and succeeded&nbsp;for a time in ousting the JIagyar ban of Severin and thus incorporating Little Walachia, the country west of the Aluta, in his&nbsp;dominions. Subsequently, in order to retain a hold on the loyalty&nbsp;of the Walachian voivode, the king of Hungary invested him with&nbsp;the title of duke of Fogaras and Omlas, Rouman districts situate&nbsp;in Transylvania, and this investiture seems to have left its impress&nbsp;on the traditional account of Radul Negru.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Under the voivode JIircea (1383-1419), whose prowess is still celebrated in the national folk-songs, Walachia played for a while&nbsp;a more ambitious part. This prince, during the earlier part of his&nbsp;reign, sought a counterpoise to Hungarian influence in the close&nbsp;alliance with King Vladislav Jagieflo of Poland. He added to his&nbsp;other titles that of “count of Severin, despot of the Dobrudja, and&nbsp;lord of Silistria, ” and both Widin and Sistov appear in his possession. A Walachian contingent, apparently Jlircea’s, aided the&nbsp;Servian Kniaz Lazar on the fatal field of Kosovo ; later he was led&nbsp;by the force of circumstances to ally himself with his former&nbsp;enemy Sigismund of Hungary against Bajazet, and in 1396 shared&nbsp;with him the disaster of Nikopolis. Bajazet subsequently invaded&nbsp;and laid waste a large part of Walachia, but the voivode succeeded&nbsp;in inflicting considerable loss on the retiring Turks, and the capture&nbsp;of Bajazet by Timur in 1402 gave the country a reprieve. In the&nbsp;internecine struggle that followed amongst the sons of Bajazet,&nbsp;JIircea espoused the cause of JIusa ; but, though he thus obtained&nbsp;for a while considerable influence in the Turkish councils, this&nbsp;policy eventually drew on him the vengeance of Sultan JIahomet I.,&nbsp;who succeeded in reducing him to a tributary position.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the succeeding period the JValachian princes appear alternately as the allies of Hungary or the creatures of the Turk.&nbsp;In the later battle of Kosovo of 1448, between Hunyadiand Sultan&nbsp;JIurad, the JJ<sup>r</sup>alachian contingent treacherously surrendered to the&nbsp;Turks, but this did not hinder the victorious sultan from massacring&nbsp;the prisoners and adding to the tribute a yearly contribution of&nbsp;3000 javelins and 4000 shields. In 1453 Constantinople fell ; in&nbsp;1454 Hunyadi died ; and two years later the sultan invaded&nbsp;JValachia to set up Vlad IV., the son of a former voivode. The&nbsp;father of this Vlad had himself been notorious for his ferocity,&nbsp;but his son, during his Turkish sojourn, had improved on his&nbsp;father’s example. He was known in JWalachia as “ Dracul,” or the&nbsp;Devil, and has left a name in history as Vlad the Impaler. The&nbsp;stories of his ferocious savagery exceed belief. He is said to have&nbsp;feasted amongst his impaled victims. JVhen the sultan JIahomet,&nbsp;infuriated at the impalement of his envoy, the pasha of JVidin, who&nbsp;had been charged with Vlad’s deposition, invaded Walachia in&nbsp;person with an immense host, he is said to have found at one spot&nbsp;a forest of pales on which were the bodies of men, women, and&nbsp;children. The voivode Radul, who was now substituted for&nbsp;this monster by Turkish influence, was constrained to pay a tribute&nbsp;of 12,000 ducats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The shifting policy of the JValachian princes at this time is well described in a letter of the Hungarian king JIatthias to&nbsp;Casimir of Poland. “The voivodes,” he writes, “of JValachia and&nbsp;JIoldavia fawn alternately upon the Turks, the Tatars, the Poles,&nbsp;and the Hungarians, that among so many masters their perfidy&nbsp;may remain unpunished.” The prevalent laxity of marriage, the&nbsp;frequency of divorce, and the fact that illegitimate children could&nbsp;succeed as well as those born in lawful wedlock, by multiplying&nbsp;the candidates for tho voivodeship and preventing any regular&nbsp;system of succession, contributed much to the Internalconfusion of&nbsp;the country. The elections, though often controlled by the Divan,&nbsp;were still constitutionally in the hands of the boiars, who were&nbsp;split up into various factions, each with its own pretender to the&nbsp;throne. The princes followed one another in rapid succession,&nbsp;and a large proportion met with violent ends. A large part of&nbsp;the population led a pastoral life, and at the time of Verantius’s visit&nbsp;to JValachia in the early part of the 16th century the towns and&nbsp;villages were built of wood and wattle and daub. Tirgovist alone,&nbsp;at this time the capital of the country, was a considerable town,&nbsp;with two stone castles. Nagul Bassaraba, who succeeded in 1512,&nbsp;was a great builder of monasteries, and, besides erecting a monastic&nbsp;church at Argish, which he coated with white marble, and a new&nbsp;cathedral at Tirgovist, adorned JIount Athos with his pious works.&nbsp;He transferred the direct allegiance of the Walachian Church&nbsp;to Constantinople. On NaguPs death, however, in 1521, the&nbsp;brief period of comparative prosperity which his architectural&nbsp;works attest was tragically interrupted, and it seemed for a time</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
