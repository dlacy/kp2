<p><span class="font0">who had failed to comply with the request of his testator, indicated his approval of the new institution by remitting the matter to the&nbsp;consuls of the day, with instructions to do in the circumstances&nbsp;what they thought just. So quickly did it establish itself in public&nbsp;favour, and so numerous did the questions become as to the construction and fulfilment of testamentary trusts, that under Claudius&nbsp;it was found necessary to institute a court specially charged with&nbsp;their adjudication—that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">praetor fideicommissarius.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The employment of a trust as a. means of benefiting those who were under disqualifications as heirs or legatees, as, for example,&nbsp;persons who had no </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">testamenti factio,.</span><span class="font0"> women incapacitated by the&nbsp;Voconian law, unmarried and married but childless persons incapacitated by the Julian and Papia-Poppaean law, and so on, was&nbsp;in time prohibited by statute; but that did not affect its general&nbsp;popularity. For, whether what was contemplated was a transfer&nbsp;of the universal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">hereditas</span><span class="font0"> or an aliquot part of it to the beneficiary&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(fidekommissum hereditatis),</span><span class="font0"> or only of some particular thing&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(fideicommissum rei singularis),</span><span class="font0"> a testamentary trust had various&nbsp;advantages over either a direct institution or a direct bequest&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(legatum).</span><span class="font0"> Still the imposition upon the heir of a trust in favour of&nbsp;a beneficiary, whether it required him. to denude of .the whole or&nbsp;only a part of the inheritance, did not in theory deprive him of his&nbsp;character of heir or relieve him of the responsibilities of the position;&nbsp;and at common law therefore he was entitled to decline the succession, often to the great prejudice of the beneficiary. In order&nbsp;to avoid such a mischance, ana at the same time to regulate their&nbsp;relations </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">inter se</span><span class="font0"> and towards debtors.and creditors of the testator,&nbsp;it became the practice for the parties to enter into stipulatory&nbsp;arrangements about the matter; but these were to some extent&nbsp;rendered superfluous by two se.natusconsults, the Trebellian in the&nbsp;time of Nero and the Pegasian in that of Vespasian, which not only&nbsp;secured the beneficiary against the trustee’s (i.e. the heir’s) repudiation of the inheritance, but also protected the latter from all risk&nbsp;of loss where he was trustee ana nothing more, and enabled the&nbsp;former to treat directly with debtors and creditors.of the testator&nbsp;and himself ingather the corporeal items of the inheritance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was one of the advantages of a trust-bequest, whether universal or singular, that it might be conferred in a codicil, even though&nbsp;unconfirmed by any relative testament. The codicil </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(codicilli),</span><span class="font0"> also&nbsp;^n invention of the time of Augustus, was a deed of a very simple&nbsp;nature. Though in the later Empire it required to be formally&nbsp;attested by at least five witnesses, it was at first quite informal.&nbsp;It was inappropriate either for disherison of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sui</span><span class="font0"> or institution of an&nbsp;heir; but if confirmed by testament, either prior or posterior to&nbsp;its date, it might contain direct bequests, manumissions, nominations of tutors, and the like, and whether confirmed or unconfirmed&nbsp;might, as stated, be utilized as a vehicle for trust-gifts. Latterly&nbsp;it was held operative, even in the absence of a testament, the trusts&nbsp;contained in it being regarded as burdens on the heir-at-law.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The most important changes in the law of intestate succession during the period were those accomplished by the Tertullian and&nbsp;Orphitian senatusconsults, fruits of.that respect for the precepts of&nbsp;natural law which in so many directions was modifying the doctrines&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus civile.</span><span class="font0"> The first was passed in the reign of Hadrian, the&nbsp;second in the year 178, under Marcus Aurelius. Down to the time&nbsp;of the Tertullian senatusconsult a mother and her child by a marriage&nbsp;that was unaccompanied with </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> stood related to each other&nbsp;only as cognates, being in law members of different families; consequently their chance of succession to each other was remote, being&nbsp;postponed to that of their respective agnates. The purpose of the&nbsp;senatusconsult was to prefer a mother to all agnates of her deceased&nbsp;child except father and brother and sister; father and brother&nbsp;excluded her; but with a sister of the deceased, and in the absence&nbsp;of father or brother, she shared equally. While there can be little&nbsp;doubt that it was considerations of natural law that.dictated this&nbsp;amendment, yet its authors were too timid to justify it on the&nbsp;abstract principle of common humanity, and so they confined its&nbsp;application to women who had the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus liberorum, i.e.</span><span class="font0"> to women of&nbsp;free birth who were mothers of three children and freedwomen&nbsp;who were mothers of four, thus making it ostensibly a reward of&nbsp;fertility. The Orphitian senatusconsult was the counterpart of the&nbsp;Tertullian. It gave children, whether legitimate or illegitimate, a&nbsp;right of succession to their.mother in preference to all her agnates;&nbsp;and subsequent constitutions extended the principle, admitting&nbsp;lawful children to the inheritance not only of their maternal grandparents but also to that of their paternal grandmother.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">iii. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Judicial Procedure.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">The Formular System.<sup>@@1</sup> </span><span class="font0">The ordinary procedure during the greater part of the first three centuries of the Empire was still&nbsp;two-staged; it commenced before the praetor </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(in jure)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and was concluded before a judge or judges </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(in judicio).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">But the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actiones</span><span class="font0"> had with a few exceptions given place&nbsp;to praetorian formulae. Under the sacramental system parties,</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">and particularly the plaintiff, had themselves to formulate in statutory or traditional words of style the matter in controversy&nbsp;between them; and as they formulated, so did it go for trial to&nbsp;centumviral court or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judex,</span><span class="font0"> with the not infrequent result that it&nbsp;was then all too late discovered that the real point in the case had&nbsp;been missed. Under the formular system parties were free to&nbsp;represent their plaint and defence to the praetor in any words they&nbsp;pleased, the plaintiff asking for a formula and usually indicating&nbsp;the style on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">album</span><span class="font0"> that he thought would suit his purpose, and&nbsp;the defendant demanding when necessary an exception, t.c. a plea&nbsp;in defence, either praetorian or statutory, that, without traversing&nbsp;the facts or law of the plaintiff’s case, avoided his demand on grounds&nbsp;of equity or public policy or the like. It was for the praetor to&nbsp;consider and determine whether the action or exception should or&nbsp;should not be granted, and, if granted, whether it should be according to the style exhibited on the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cdbum</span><span class="font0"> or according to a mixlification&nbsp;of it. The result he embodied in a written and signed appointment&nbsp;of a j udge, whom he instructed what he had to try, and empowered&nbsp;to pronounce a finding either condemning or acquitting the defendant.&nbsp;This writing was the formula.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although it was not until the early Empire that this system of civil procedure attained its full development, yet it had l/egun&nbsp;between one and two centuries before the fall of the Republic.&nbsp;Gaius ascribes its introduction and definitive establishment to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">lex Aebutia</span><span class="font0"> and two judiciary laws of the time of Augustus, formerly&nbsp;mentioned </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(supra,</span><span class="font0"> pp. 98, 124). The Aebutian law, of which&nbsp;unfortunately we know very little,, is generally supposed to have&nbsp;empowered the praetors (1) to devise a simpler form of procedure&nbsp;for causes already cognizable </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per legis actionem,</span><span class="font0"> (2) to devise&nbsp;forms of action to meet cases not cognizable undertheoldcr system,&nbsp;and (3) themselves to formulate the issue and reduce it to writing.&nbsp;It was by no means so radical a change as is sometimes supposed.&nbsp;There were formulae employed by the peregrin praetor before it&nbsp;and also perhaps something analogous thereto by the urban praetor.&nbsp;There were also formulae of a kind employed both in the procedure&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per judicis postulationem</span><span class="font0"> and in that </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">per condictionem.</span><span class="font0"> The difference between the latter and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">formulae</span><span class="font0"> of the Aebutian system&nbsp;was that they were in part mere echoes of the statutory words of&nbsp;style uttered by the plaintiff, and that they were not written but&nbsp;spoken in the hearing of witnesses.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A large proportion of the personal actions of the formular system were evolved out of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio per condictionem.</span><span class="font0"> The sequence&nbsp;of operations may have been something like this. Taking&nbsp;the simplest form of it, the action for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">certa pecunia</span><span class="font0"> under&nbsp;the Silian law, the first step was to drop the formal </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">condictio</span><span class="font0"> from which it derived its character of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio,</span><span class="font0"> thus&nbsp;avoiding a delay of thirty days; the plaintiff stated his demand in informal words, and, if the defendant denied indebtedness,&nbsp;the praetor straightway formulated a written appointment of and&nbsp;instruction to a judge, embodying in it the issue in terms substantially the same as those he would have employed under the&nbsp;earlier procedure:—“Titius be judge. Should it appear that&nbsp;N. N. ought to pay </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(dare oportere)</span><span class="font0"> 50,000 sesterces to A. A., in that&nbsp;sum condemn N.N. to A.A.;<sup>@@2</sup> should it so not appear, acquit him.”&nbsp;This was no longer the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio per condictionem,</span><span class="font0"> because what&nbsp;had made it </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">legis actio</span><span class="font0"> was gone, but the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">condictio certae pecuniae&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">of the formular system. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">condictio triticaria</span><span class="font0"> of the same system&nbsp;ran on the same lines: “ Titius be judge.. Should it appear that&nbsp;N. N. ought to give A. A. the slave Stichus, then, whatever be&nbsp;the value of the slave, in that condemn N. N. to A. A.,” and so on.&nbsp;In each of these examples the formula included only two of the&nbsp;four principal clauses that might find place in it<sup>@@3</sup> an “ intention ”&nbsp;and a “ condemnation.” The matter of claim in both cases was&nbsp;certain,—so much money in one, a slave in the other; but, while&nbsp;in the first the condemnation, also was certain, in the second it w’as&nbsp;uncertain. What if the.claim also was uncertain,—say a share&nbsp;of the profits of a joint adventure assured by stipulation ?&nbsp;It was perhaps competent for the plaintiff to specify a definite&nbsp;sum, and claim that as due to him; but it was very hazardous,&nbsp;for unless he was able to prove the debt to the last sesterce he lost&nbsp;his case. To obviate the risk of such failure the praetors devised&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">actio ex stipulate,</span><span class="font0"> whose formula commenced with a “demonstration ” or indication of the cause of action, and w'hose “ intention ” referred to it and was conceived indefinitely: “ Titius be&nbsp;judge. Whereas A. A. stipulated with N. N. for a share of the&nbsp;profits of a joint adventure, whatever in respect thereof N. N. ought&nbsp;to give to or do for </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(dare facere oportet)</span><span class="font0"> A. A., in the money amount</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
