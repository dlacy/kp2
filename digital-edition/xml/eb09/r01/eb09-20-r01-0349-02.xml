<p><label>REICHENBACH</label>
a manufacturing town of Saxony, in the province of Zwickau, lies in the hilly district known as the Voigtland, 50 miles to the south of Leipsic. The chief industrial products are woollen cloth, merino, cashmere, flannel, and shawls. Its importance is of recent origin, and the population, amounting to 16,509 in 1880, has trebled itself within the last fifty years. The earliest notice of the town occurs in a document of 1212, and it acquired municipal rights in 1367.</p>
