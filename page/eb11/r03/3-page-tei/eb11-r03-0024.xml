Her beauty appeared to her contemporaries to be only equalled by her childish silliness; but her letters to her husband, preserved in the British Museum, are not devoid of good sense and feeling. The king’s infatuation was so great that when the queen’s life was despaired of in 1663, it was reported that he intended to marry Miss Stewart, and four years later he was considering the possibility of obtaining a divorce to enable him to make her his wife. This was at a time when Charles feared he was in danger of losing her as his mistress, her hand being sought in marriage by Charles Stuart, duke of Richmond and Lennox. The duchess of Cleveland, who was losing her hold on the king’s affections, is reported hy Hamilton to have led the king to Miss Stewart’s apartment at midnight when Richmond was closeted with her, and the duke was immediately expelled from court. In March 1667 the lady eloped from WhitehalI with Richmond and married him secretly in the country. The king, who was greatly enraged, suspected Clarendon of being privy to the marriage, and, according to Burnet, deprived him of office for this offence. The duchess of Richmond, however, soon returned to court, where she remained for many years; and although she was disfigured by small-pox in 1668, she retained her hold on the king’s affections. Her husband was sent as ambassador to Denmark, where he died in 1672. The duchess was present at the birth of the prince of Wales, son of James II., in 1688, being one of those who signed the certificate before the council She died in 1702, leaving a valuable property to her nephew the earl of Blantyre, whose seat was named Lennoxlove after her.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Bibliography.—Gilbert Burnet, </hi><hi rend="italic">History of my own Time</hi>  (6 vols., Oxford, 1833) ; Samuel Pepys, <hi rend="italic">Diary,</hi>  9 vols.

He was the most popular, and in many ways the most typicaI German illustrator of the middle of the 19th century. His work is as typically German and homely as are the fairy-tales of Grimm. Richter visited Italy from 1823-26, and his “ Thunderstorm in the Sabine Mountains ” at the Staedel Institute in Frankfort is one of the rare Italian subjects from his brush. In 1828 he worked as designer for the Meissen factory, and in 1841 he became professor and head of the landscape atelier at the Dresden Academy. The Dresden Gallery owns one of his best and most characteristic paintings in the “ Bridal Procession in a Spring Landscape.” He died at Loschwitz near Dresden in 1884.</p><p>RICHTER, ERNST FRIEDRICH EDUARD (1808-1879), German musical theorist, was born at Grosschonau in Saxony, on the 24th of October 1808. He first studied music at Zittau, and afterwards at Leipzig, where he attained so high a reputation that in 1843 he was appointed professor of harmony and counterpoint at the conservatorium of music, then newly founded by Mendelssohn. On the death of Hauptmann on the 3rd of January 1868, he was elected cantor of the Thomasschule, which office he retained until his death on the 9th of April 1879. He is best known by three theoretical works—<hi rend="italic">Lehrbuch der Harmonie, Lehre vom Contrapunct</hi>  and <hi rend="italic">Lehre von der Fuge— </hi>valuable textbooks known to English students through the excellent translation by Franklin Taylor.</p><p>RICHTER, EUGEN (1839-1906), German politician, was born on the 30th of July 1839 at Düsseldorf. After attending the universities of Bonn, Heidelberg and Berlin, he entered the government service, being stationed in his native town. In 1864 he was chosen burgomaster of Neuwied; but he was already known for his Liberal opinions, and the government refused to confirm the appointment. He was hereupon transferred to Bromberg, in East Prussia, which to an inhabitant of the Rhineland was the worst form of exile, and in consequence he resigned his place in the public service. He now went to Berlin, where he earned his living as a journalist. He was the most consistent advocate of those doctrines of <hi rend="italic">laissez faire</hi>  and individual liberty which the Germans call <hi rend="italic">Manchestertum.</hi>  He was also keenly interested in the attempts made at that period to create cooperative societies among the working men, and wrote a work on co-operative stores. It was not long before he came into conflict with the government; an electioneering pamphlet published in 1867 was confiscated; he was put on his trial but acquitted. In 1867 he was elected a member of the newly formed Reichstag, and in 1869 of the Prussian parliament. He soon became one of the most influential politicians in Germany. A member of the Progressive party, in 1880 one of the founders, and eventually the leader, of the Freisinnige, he was always in opposition. Next to Windthorst <hi rend="italic">(q.v.)</hi>  he was Bismarck’s most dangerous opponent. After the great change of policy in 1878, for a time his influence was a great impediment to the government; as a consistent adherent to free trade, he was the leader of the opposition to the introduction of protection, to the new colonial policy, and to State Socialism. Itwas after 1880 that he raised the cry <hi rend="italic">Bismarck muss fort.</hi>  He always took a great part in debates on the military and naval establishments, in vain opposing the constant increase of army and navy. It was his refusal to support the government proposals in 1893 for an increase of the army which led to the break up of his party: he was left with only eleven followers; and, except among the middle class of Berlin and some other Prussian cities, the old Radical party, of which he was the chief representative, from that time had influence in the country. In 1885 he founded the <hi rend="italic">Freisinnige Zeitung,</hi>  which he edited himself; of his numerous brochures the most successful was his attack on Socialism, entitled <hi rend="italic">SoziMemokratische Zukunftsbilder</hi>  (Berlin, 1891), a clever and successful satire on the Socialist state of the future. This has been translated into the EngHsh. He also wrote much on Prussian finance, and under the title <hi rend="italic">Das politische A, B, C Buch </hi>compiled a very useful political handbook for Radical voters. He also published in 1892 reminiscences of his youth <hi rend="italic">(Jugend-er inner ungen),</hi>  and two volumes of pariiamentary reminiscences <hi rend="italic">(lm alten Reichstag,</hi>  1894-1896).</p><p>He died at Jena on the 26th of January 1006.</p><p>RlCHTER, HANS (1843-    ), Hungarian musical conductor,</p><p>born at Raab on the 4th of April 1843, was the son of the kapellmeister at the cathedral, and of his wife, <hi rend="italic">née</hi>  Josephine Csazinsky, who was the first to perform Venus in <hi rend="italic">Tannhäuser </hi>at Vienna. Young Hans sang either soprano or alto in the cathedral choir, according to requirement, and OccasionaHy played the organ. But his public <hi rend="italic">debut</hi>  was made as a drummer in Haydn’s <hi rend="italic">Paukenmesse.</hi>  In 1853, at the age of ten, he appeared in a concert as pianist in Hummel’s E flat quintet; and in 1854, after his father’s death, went to the choristers’ school, the Convikt (where Schubert was educated) in Vienna, and there became chorister in the Court ChapeL For five years from i860 Richter studied under Heissler and Sechter in the Vienna Conservatorium,and he learnt the horn under Kleinecke. A year and a half after his first lesson he became hornist in the old Karnth-nerthor Theatre at £3 a month. Meanwhile he had devoted time to conducting. It was not till August 1868 that Richter made his first appearance as a conductor, at the Hof Theater, Munich (where he had just been appointed), in <hi rend="italic">William Tell, </hi>but in the next year Jie resigned this post, went first to Paris, then to Brussels, and finaUy to Triebschcn, where he copied <hi rend="italic">Der Ring des Nibelungen</hi>  for Wagner. In April 1871 Richter took up his new duties as conductor of the Hungarian National Opera at Budapest, where he remained four years, until he began in May 1875 his long connexion with the Vienna Opera, which terminated only with the century.
