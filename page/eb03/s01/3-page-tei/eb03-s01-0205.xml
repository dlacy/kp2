On the tenth of September, after their meeting, they came to the following agrcement:</p><p>Firſt, That the king of Scotland and his heirs, as an equivalent for his entertainment while in England, ſhould pay to the king of England and his heirs, at London, in the church of St Paul, by equal proportions, the ſum of forty thouſand pounds Sterling.</p><p>Secondly, That the firſt payment, amounting to the ſum of ten thouſand merks, ſhould be made ſix months after the king of Scotland’s entering his own kingdom; that the like ſum ſhould be paid the next year, and ſo on during the ſpace of ſix years, when the whole ſum would be cleared; unleſs, after payment of forty thouſand merks, the laſt payment of ten thouſand ſhould be remitted, at the intreaty of the moſt illuſtrious prince Thomas duke of Exeter.</p><p>Thirdly, That the king of Scotland, before entering his own kingdom, ſhould give ſufficient hoſtages for performance on his part. But, in regard that the Scots plenipotentiaries had no inſtructions concerning hoſtages, it was agreed,</p><p>Fourthly, That the king of Scotland ſhould be at Branſpath, or Durham, by the firſt of March next, where he ſhould be attended by the nobles of his blood, and other ſubjects, in order to fix the number and quality of the hoſtages.</p><p>Fifthly, That, to cement and perpetuate the amity of the two kingdoms, the governor of Scotland ſhould ſend ambaſſadors to London, with power to conclude a contract of marriage between the king of Scotland and ſome lady of the firſt quality in England.</p><p>James, it is probable, had already fixed his choice upon the lady Joan, daughter to the late earl of Somerſet, who was ſon to John of Gaunt duke of Lancaſter, by his ſecond marriage; but he made his people the compliment, not only of conſulting their opinion, but of concluding the match. The commiſſioners, after their agreement at York, proceeded towards London; and Thomas Somerville of Carnwath, with Walter Ogilvy, were added to their number. Being arrived at that capital, they ratified the former articles, and undertook for their king, that he ſhould deliver his hoſtages to the king of England’s officers, in the city of Durham, before the laſt day of the enſuing month of March; that he ſhould alſo deliver to the ſaid officers four obligatory letters, for the whole ſum of 40,000 l. from the four burghs of Edinburgh, Perth, Dundee, and Aberdeen; that he ſhould give his obligatory letter to the ſame purpoſe, before removing from Durham, and ſhould renew the ſame four days after his arrival in his own kingdom; that the hoſtages might be changed from time to time for others of the ſame fortune and quality; that if any of them ſhould die in England, others ſhould be ſent thither in their room; and that while they continued to ſtay in England, they ſhould live at their own charges.</p><p>The marriage of James with the lady Joan Beaufort was celebrated in the beginning of February 1424. The young king of England preſented him with a ſuit of cloth of gold for the ceremony; and the next day he received a legal discharge of 10,000 pounds, to be deducted from the 40,000 at which his ranſom was fixed, and which ſum was given as the marriage- portion of the lady. The ceremony being performed, the king and queen ſet out for Durham, where the hoſtages were waiting; and arrived at his own dominions, along with the earl of Northumberland and the chief of the northern nobility, who attended him with great pomp. On the 20th of April the ſame year, he was crowned at Scone; alter which ceremony, he followed the example practiſed by other ſovereigns at that time, of knighting ſeveral noblemen and gentlemen.</p><p>During the dependence of the treaty for James’s releaſe, the Scots had emigrated to France in ſuch numbers, that no fewer than 15,000 of them now appeared in arms under the duke of Touraine; but as the hiſtory of the war in that country has already been given under the article <hi rend="smallcaps">France,</hi> we ſhall take no farther notice of it at preſent, but return to the affairs of Scotland.</p><p>On his return James found himſelf in a diſagreeable ſituation. The great maxim of the duke of Albany, when regent, had been to maintain himſelf in power by exempting the lower claſs of people from taxes of every kind. This plan had been continued by his ſon Murdoch; but as the latter was deſtitute of his father’s abilities, the people abuſed their happineſs, and Scotland became ſuch a ſcene of rapine, that no commoner could ſay he had a property in his own eſtate. The Stewart family, on their acceſſion to the crown of Scotland, were poſſeſſed of a very conſiderable patrimonial eſtate, independent of the ſtanding revenues of the crown, which conſiſted chiefly of cuſtoms, wards, and reliefs. The revenues of the paternal eſtate belonging to James, had they been regularly tranſmitted to him, would have more than maintained him in a ſplendour equal to his dignity, while he was in England; nor would he in that caſe have had any occaſion for an allowance from the king of England. But as the duke of Albany never intended that his nephew ſhould return, he parcelled out among his favourites the eſtate of the Stewart family, in ſuch a manner that James upon his return found all his patrimonial revenues gone, and many of them in the hands of his beſt friends; ſo that he had nothing to depend on for the ſupport of himſelf and his court but the crown-revenues above- mentioned, and even ſome of theſe had been mortgaged during the late regency. This circumſtance, of itſelf ſufficiently diſagreeable, was attended with two others, which tended to make it more ſo. The one was, that the hoſtages which had been left for the king’s ranſom in England, being all of them perſons of the firſt rank, were attended by their wives, families, children, and equipages, which rivalled thoſe of the ſame rank in England, and drew a great deal of ready money out of the nation. The other circumſtance aroſe from the charge of the Scots army in France; where Charles, who had never been in a condition to ſupport it, was now reduced to the utmoſt neceſſity: while the revenues of James himſelf were both ſcanty and precarious. To remedy theſe inconveniences, therefore, the king obtained from his parliament an act obliging the ſheriffs of the reſpective counties to inquire what lands and eſtates had belonged to his anceſtors David II. Robert II. and Robert III.; and James formed a reſolution of reſuming theſe lands wherever they could be diſcovered, without regard to perſons or circumſtances. On this</p></body></text></TEI>
