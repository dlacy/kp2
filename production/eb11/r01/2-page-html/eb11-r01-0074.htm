<p><span class="font1">Sleepers, called ties or cross-ties in America, are the blocks or slabs on which the rails are carried. They are nearly always&nbsp;placed transversely, across the direction of the lines, the longi-tudinal position such as was adopted in connexion with the&nbsp;broad gauge on the Great Western in England having been&nbsp;abandoned except in special cases. Stone blocks were tried as&nbsp;sleepers in the early days of railways, but they proved too rigid,&nbsp;and besides, it was found difficult to keep the line true with&nbsp;them. Wood is the material most widely used, but steel is&nbsp;employed in some countries where timber is scarce or liable&nbsp;to destruction by white ants, though it is still regarded as&nbsp;too expensive in comparison with wood for general adoption.&nbsp;Steel sleepers were used experimentally on the London &amp;&nbsp;North-Western, but were abandoned owing to the shortness of&nbsp;their life. In Germany, where they have met with greater&nbsp;favour, there were over 26½ millions in use in 1905, @@<sup>1</sup> and they&nbsp;have been tried by some American railways. Numerous forms&nbsp;of ferro-concrete sleepers have also been devised.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Great Britain, Germany and France, at least 90% of the wooden sleepers are “ treated ” before they are laid, to&nbsp;increase their resistance to decay, and the same practice is&nbsp;followed to some extent in other European countries. A great&nbsp;number of preservative processes have been devised. In that&nbsp;most largely used, known as “ creosoting, ” dead oil of tar, to&nbsp;the amount of some 3 gallons per sleeper, is forced into the&nbsp;wood under pressure, or is sucked in by vacuum, both the&nbsp;timber and the oil being heated. In the United States only a&nbsp;small percentage of the ties are treated in any way beyond&nbsp;seasoning in the open air, timber, in the opinion of the railway&nbsp;officials, being still too cheap in nearly all parts of that country&nbsp;to justify the use of preservatives. Some railway companies,&nbsp;however, having a long mileage in timberless regions, do&nbsp;“ treat ” their sleepers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Typical dimensions for sleepers on important British railways are: —length 9 ft., breadth 10 in., and depth 5 in. In America&nbsp;8 ft. is the most common length, the breadth being 8 in., and the&nbsp;depth 6 or 7 in.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">There are two main ways of attaching the rails to the sleepêrs, corresponding to two main types of rails—the bull-headed rail and the Vignoles or flange rail. In the first method, which is&nbsp;practically universal in Great Britain and is also employed to</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">some extent in France and India, the rails have rounded bases and are supported by being wedged, with wooden keys, in cast-iron chairs which are bolted to the sleepers. In the second&nbsp;method the rails have flat flanged bases which rest directly on&nbsp;the sleepers (fig. 10). The chairs on the British system weigh&nbsp;about 45 or 50 lb each on important lines, though they may be&nbsp;less where the traffic is light, and are fixed to the sleepers each&nbsp;by two, three or four fastenings, either screw spikes, or round&nbsp;drift bolts entered in holes previously bored, or fang bolts or&nbsp;wooden trenails. Sometimes a strip of felt is interposed between&nbsp;the chair and the sleeper, and sometimes a serrated surface is&nbsp;prepared on the sleeper for the chair which is forced into its&nbsp;seat by hydraulic pressure. The keys which hold the rail in the&nbsp;chairs are usually of oak and are placed outside the rails; the&nbsp;inside position has also been employed, but has the disadvantage&nbsp;of detracting from the elasticity of the road since the weight of a&nbsp;passing train presses the rails up against a rigid mass of metal&nbsp;instead of against a slightly yielding block of wood. The rails,&nbsp;which for heavy main line traffic may weigh as much as 100 ℔&nbsp;per yard, or even more, are rolled in lengths of from 30 to 60 ft.,&nbsp;and sleepers are placed under them at intervals of between 2&nbsp;and 3 ft. (centre to centre), 11 sleepers to a 30 ft. rail being a&nbsp;common arrangement. On the London &amp; North-Western railway&nbsp;there are 24 sleepers to each 60 ft. rail. A small space is left&nbsp;between the end of one rail and that of the next, in order to allow&nbsp;for expansion in hot weather, and at the joint the two are&nbsp;firmly braced together by a pair of fish-plates (fig. 11). These&nbsp;are flat bars of iron or steel from 18 in. to 2 ft.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">long, which are lodged in the channels of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">rail, one on each side, and secured with four</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">bolts passing through the web; sometimes, to</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">give additional stiffness, they extend down</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">below the lower table of the rail and are bent</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">round so as to clip it. Occasionally the joints</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">thus formed are “ supported ” on a sleeper,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">as was the practice in the early days of rail</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">way construction, But they are generally</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">“ suspended ” between two sleepers, which are</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">set rather more closely together than at other points in the rail. Preferably, they are so arranged that those in both lines of rails&nbsp;come opposite each other and are placed between the same pair&nbsp;of sleepers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Flat-bottomed rails are fastened to the sleepers by hook-headed spikes, the heads of which project over the flanges. In the United States the spikes are simply driven in with a maul,&nbsp;and the rails stand upright, little care being taken to prepare&nbsp;seats for them on the sleepers, on which they soon seat them-selves. The whole arrangement is simple and cheap in first&nbsp;cost, and it lends itself admirably to fast track-laying and to&nbsp;repairs and changes of line. On the continent of Europe the&nbsp;practice is common of notching the sleeper so as to give the rail&nbsp;a slight cant inwards—a result obtained in England by canting&nbsp;the rail in the chairs—and metal plates or strips of felt are put&nbsp;under the rail, which is carefully fastened to the sleeper by&nbsp;screwed spikes (fig. 12). This method of construction is more</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">expensive than the American in first cost, but it gives a more durable and stable track. Such metal plates, or “ tie-plates, ”&nbsp;have come into considerable use also in the United States, where&nbsp;they are always made of rolled steel, punched with rectangular&nbsp;holes through which the spikes pass. They serve two principal</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
