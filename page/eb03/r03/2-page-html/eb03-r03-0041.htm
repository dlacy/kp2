<p><span class="font0">We may alſo obſerve, that the diſtance of the axis from the centre S of gyration is a mean proportional&nbsp;between its diſtance from the centre G of gravity and&nbsp;the centre O of oſcillation : for we had (n<sup>0</sup>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;.)</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">CO.CG = &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= CS <sup>1</sup> </span><span class="font1">and </span><span class="font0">CO : CS = CS : CG.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">m</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We ſee alſo that the diſtance CO is that at which an external force muſt be applied ; ſo that there may&nbsp;not be any preſſure excited in the axis upon its points&nbsp;of ſupport, and the axis may be a ſpontaneous axis of&nbsp;converſion. This we learn, by comparing the value of&nbsp;CO with that oſ'CP in art. 30. This being the caſe,&nbsp;it follows, that if an external force is applied in a direction paſſing thro’ O, perpendicularly to CO, it will produce the ſame initial velocity of the centre as if the&nbsp;body were free : for as it exerts no preſſure on the&nbsp;points of ſupport, the initial motion muſt be the ſame&nbsp;as if they were not there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the external force be applied at a greater diſtance in the line CG, the velocity of the centre will be greater than if the body were free. In this caſe the preſ-fure excited in the axis will be backward, and conſequently the points of ſupport will re-act forward, and&nbsp;this re-action will be equivalent to another external&nbsp;force conſpiring with the one applied at </span><span class="font1">O. Some&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">curious conſequences may be deduced from this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">If the external force be applied to a point in the line GC, lying beyond C, the motion of the centre will&nbsp;be in the oppoſite direction to what it would have taken had the body been free, and ſo will be the preſ-ſures exerted by the points of ſupport on the axis.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A force w.GI applied at P produces the initial pro-<sup>; </sup>greſſive motion rc.GH ; and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">any</span><span class="font0"> force applied at O,&nbsp;perpendicularly to CG, produces the ſame motion of&nbsp;the centre as if the body were free. Therefore a force&nbsp;m.GH applied thus at O will produce a motion w.GIT&nbsp;in the centre, and therefore the ſame motion which&nbsp;τw.Gl applied at P would produce ; and it will produce&nbsp;the momentum wz.GI at P. Therefore if a force equal&nbsp;to the progreſſive motion of the body be applied at O,&nbsp;perpendicularly to CO, in the oppoſite direction, ft&nbsp;wfill ſtop all this motion wfithout exciting any ſtrain on&nbsp;the axis or points of ſuppoit. Therefore the equivalent of all the motions of each particle round C is conceived as paſſing through O in a direction perpendicular to CO ; and the blow given by that point to any&nbsp;body oppoſed to its motion is conſidered as equal to&nbsp;the compounded effect of the rotatory motion, or to&nbsp;the progreſſive motion of the body combined with its&nbsp;rotation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">For ſuch reafons O has been called the Centre of Percussion of the body turning round C. But the&nbsp;name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">centre of momentum,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">rotatory effort,</span><span class="font0"> would have&nbsp;been more proper.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We can feel this property of the point O when we give a ſmart blow with a flick. If we give it a motion round the joint of the wriſt only, and ſtrike ſmart-ly with a point conſiderably nearer or more remote than&nbsp;τ of its length, we feel a painful ſhock or wrench in&nbsp;the hand ; but if we ſtrike with that point which is preciſely at y of its length, we feel no ſuch diſagreeable&nbsp;ſtrain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Mechanical writers frequently ſay, that </span><span class="font1">O </span><span class="font0">conſidered as the centre of percuſſion, is that with which the moſt&nbsp;violent blow is ſtruck. But this is by no means true;&nbsp;O is that point of a body turning round C which&nbsp;gives a blow preciſely equal to the progreſſive motion&nbsp;of the body, and in the ſame direction. As we have&nbsp;already ſaid, it is the point where we may ſuppoſe the&nbsp;whole rotatory momentum of the body accumulated.&nbsp;Every particle of the body is moving in a particular direction, with a velocity proportional to its diſtance from&nbsp;the axis of rotation ; and iſ the body were ſtopped in&nbsp;any point, each particle tending to continue its motion&nbsp;endeavours to drag the reſt along with it. Whatever&nbsp;point we call the centre of percuſſion ſhould have this&nbsp;property, that when it is ſtopped by a ſuſſicient force,&nbsp;the whole motion and tendency to motion of every kind&nbsp;ſhould be ſtopped ; ſo that if at that inſtant the ſupports of the axis were annihilated, the body would remain in abſolute reſt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The conſideration of </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">veιy ſimple caſe will ſhow that this point of ſtoppage cannot be taken indifferently.&nbsp;Suppoſe a ſquare or rectangular board CDD'C', fig. 4.&nbsp;advancing in jthe direction GH, perpendicular to its&nbsp;plane, without any rotation. Let G be the centre of&nbsp;gravity, and the middle of the board. It is evident,&nbsp;that if a force be applied at G, in the direction HG,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
