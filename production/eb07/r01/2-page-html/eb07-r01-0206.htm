<p><span class="font2">In modem times the use of common-places has been universally decried, as a mere device for qualifying a man to speak or write fluently on subjects of which he is utterly&nbsp;ignorant ; and if all objections to the art were as well&nbsp;founded as this, it would be truly a waste of time to study&nbsp;it. The invention was well suited for enabling a subtile and&nbsp;flowery declaimer, like the sophist Gorgias<sub>1</sub> to justify his famous boast, that he could speak extempore on any given&nbsp;question ; but the systematic use of these storehouses of&nbsp;universal topics was utterly preposterous in the business of&nbsp;real life. “ Such discourse,” says Blair, with great truth,&nbsp;“ could be no other than trivial. What is truly solid and&nbsp;persuasive must be drawn </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ex visceribus causae,</span><span class="font2"> from a thorough knowledge of the subject, and profound meditation&nbsp;on it. They who would direct students of oratory to any&nbsp;other sources of argumentation, only delude them ; and, by&nbsp;attempting to render rhetoric too perfect an art, they render it in truth a trifling and childish study.” If we thought&nbsp;the ancient Topics really worthy of defence, we would not&nbsp;be deterred from defending them, either by this grave reasoning, or by the recollection of Corporal Trim’s extemporaneous oration on the white bear ; but the rebuke of the&nbsp;critic, and the ridicule of the wit, are both well deserved.&nbsp;And yet in this, as in most other errors, we detect merely&nbsp;the misapplication of a truth. For the invention of the&nbsp;Topics is founded on a consideration of the common principles and relations of matters of reasoning in general, and&nbsp;of those matters which are embraced under each particular&nbsp;division of knowledge ; and it is manifest that reflection on&nbsp;such general truths as these, although it should not be applied as those ancient sophists applied it, is in itself not&nbsp;merely an unobjectionable, but a positively useful and necessary duty, for those who wish either to write well or to&nbsp;think rightly. Even as to the practical use of commonplaces, no one who has been accustomed to hear practised&nbsp;public speakers can have failed to remark, that most of them&nbsp;tall more or less into the repetition of set phrases and ideas,&nbsp;which are as truly common-places as if they had been learned by rote from Boethius or Fortunatianus : and in the oratory of the bar, where extemporaneous fluency is indispensable, the systematic use of common-places is to some extent both advantageous and ordinary. For written compositions common-places are unnecessary and absurd ; and we&nbsp;are not much encouraged to their adoption by the example&nbsp;of Cicero, who, having sent to Atticus a treatise prefaced&nbsp;by an eloquent introduction, was reminded by his friend&nbsp;that he had already used the passage as the proœmium of&nbsp;another work.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Knowledge of the subject of the composition, and meditation on its facts and principles, must, as our authority just  cited has told us, be substituted for treasuries of commonplaces ; and no one has insisted on the necessity of such&nbsp;studies more strenuously than Aristotle, who, although he&nbsp;wrote with the view of aiding public speakers, and therefore, both in his Rhetoric and his Topics, collected those&nbsp;common-places which he considered most useful, yet broadly and repeatedly lays down the doctrine of their total insufficiency as the principal source of the orator’s materials.&nbsp;One chapter of the Rhetoric contains as much practical sense&nbsp;on this subject as might satisfy the most determined of modern utilitarians ; and we cannot do better than dismiss the&nbsp;topics by stating its substance, which, although addressed&nbsp;immediately to the case of public speaking, possesses much&nbsp;value even with regard to purely literary compositions. It&nbsp;has been observed, says he, that, for plebeian assemblies, unlearned men are by far the most persuasive orators. And&nbsp;why is this ? Simply because they state the particular facts&nbsp;from which they themselves have drawn their inferences,&nbsp;and which the audience know and are qualified to comprehend ; while instructed men, addressing the same hearers,&nbsp;puzzle and repel them by enunciating universal truths. This&nbsp;remark is followed by four advices to the orator. First, he&nbsp;is warmly urged to the anxious study of his subject, as in&nbsp;every view essential to his success. Secondly, the advice&nbsp;is enforced by reminding him, that the more facts he knows&nbsp;as to the matter to be handled, the better chance has he of&nbsp;discovering among them some argument which will prove&nbsp;convincing. Thirdly, he is warned that the general rule of&nbsp;oratory which directs the speaker to study and condescend&nbsp;to the characters of his hearers, must be specially applied,&nbsp;so far as his means of knowledge allow him, to the particular persons whom he happens to address. Fourthly, he is&nbsp;cautioned not to shun the statement of common and well-known facts, but rather to consider these as the great magazine of his arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The second sort of aid which the ancient rhetoricians held out for the Discovery of Arguments, namely, that which&nbsp;results from a Classification of their Kinds, is as truly sound&nbsp;and valuable as the other sort is the reverse. It has, however, met with little more favour in the eyes of the moderns ; but in our own times, one of the ablest writers on&nbsp;rhetoric has adopted Aristotle’s division of arguments, analysing it satisfactorily, and increasing its utility by several&nbsp;excellent supplements of his own. All that follows on this&nbsp;part of the subject may be considered as either suggested by&nbsp;Aristotle and Whately, or in substance directly borrowed&nbsp;from them, except a few incidental remarks and illustrations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It must be premised, however, that in every thing to be said on this head, reference is made solely to moral truths,&nbsp;as the conclusions sought to be established in argument.&nbsp;All reasoning is of course ultimately founded on admitted&nbsp;truths, and such reasoning as will serve the orator’s purpose&nbsp;must be founded on truths admitted by those whom he addresses. Necessary truths, constituting the first principles&nbsp;of the mathematical sciences, can scarcely ever enter into&nbsp;rhetorical consideration in any shape, and may be safely left&nbsp;out of view altogether. Contingent truths, composing the&nbsp;other great class of ultimate principles, and embracing truths&nbsp;moral and physical, compose the great quarry of materials for&nbsp;human thought and reasoning; the latter class, however, occupying, in most applications of rhetorical principles, a place&nbsp;comparatively subordinate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With regard to the Division of Arguments, then, it is to be observed, in the first place, that the division which aids&nbsp;the rhetorical student, is one neither founded on differences in the mode of stating them (as syllogistic, unsyllogis-tic, or the like), nor on differences in their subject (as moral or necessary), nor on differences in the purpose of using&nbsp;them (as direct or indirect, probative or refutative arguments). That which is here useful is a division of arguments </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">as such.</span><span class="font2"> Upon this principle Aristotle may be understood as dividing all arguments in moral reasoning into&nbsp;three kinds ; what he calls the </span><span class="font0">ιiz⅛s </span><span class="font2">(literally, Proof of Probability); the Sign or Symptom (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">βr</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">∣</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">μttw);</span><span class="font2"> and the Example&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">f-a^Mtιγ</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">∣</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">ιa).</span><span class="font2"> Whately first divides all arguments into Two&nbsp;Classes, the first consisting of “ such as might have been&nbsp;employed to </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">account for</span><span class="font2"> the fact or principle maintained,&nbsp;supposing its truth granted ;” the second, of “ such as&nbsp;could </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">not</span><span class="font2"> be so employed.” The former class he considers&nbsp;to be the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">unira</span><span class="font2"> of Aristotle, and terms them Arguments α&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">priori,</span><span class="font2"> or Arguments from Antecedent Probability. Those&nbsp;of the second class he considers as all referable to Aristotle’s two classes of Signs and Examples.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The f∕xJ{, or Argument </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">a priori,</span><span class="font2"> is an argument from cause to effect, these words being understood in the popular and ordinary sense. The conviction which it bears evidently admits of innumerable degrees of strength, from the&nbsp;faintest shadow of likelihood to complete moral certainty.&nbsp;The shades of distinction cannot be marked by appropriate&nbsp;terms, either in the language of common life or in that of</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
