<p><span class="font0">meadow lands, are estimated at 300,000 acres. The wood planted may be calculated at 15,000 acres.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Except upon the banks of the streams, which are commonly of no great width, there is very little level or flat land in this district; and, compared with the high grounds&nbsp;in other parts of Scotland, hardly any part of it can be said&nbsp;to be mountainous. The cultivated districts are beautifully&nbsp;diversified with narrow valleys, each traversed by its own&nbsp;rivulet, often fringed with wood, and bounded by gentle&nbsp;acclivities; and the hills in pasture are, with few exceptions,&nbsp;clothed in verdure to their very summits. On the confines&nbsp;of Northumberland, the most elevated quarter, the hills&nbsp;seldom reach the height of 2000 feet, but there are many&nbsp;from that height down to 1000 or 800 feet. The most&nbsp;considerable are the Minto and the Eildon Hills, both in the&nbsp;arable division; and Dunion, Ruberslaw, Wisp, Hownam&nbsp;Law, Millenwood-Fell, Carter-Fell, and Chillhill, in the&nbsp;pastoral districts. Most of them having a conical form, insulated at their base by streamlets, and not rising in a continuous range, present very conspicuous objects, and at a&nbsp;distance seem higher than they are found to be when approached. The beauties of the natural scenery have been&nbsp;heightened and improved by the wealth and industry of its&nbsp;inhabitants; all this division abounding in gentlemen’s seats,&nbsp;comfortable and even elegant farm-houses, the fields enclosed with hedges of thorn, and belts of wood, and many spots&nbsp;covered with young trees. On the skirts of the hills, too,&nbsp;cultivation has of late made considerable progress, as much,&nbsp;perhaps, as could be expected in the natural circumstances&nbsp;of the country ; but the interior of the pastoral district is in&nbsp;general naked, without trees or fences, and very thinly inhabited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The prevailing soil of the arable land, and over most of the hills, is what is called a sandy loam, though of different&nbsp;qualities, excellently adapted to the turnip culture. Tracts&nbsp;of a clayey or more heavy soil, however, occupy a considerable space, especially on the north-west. Clay is also&nbsp;found on the north, near the Tweed, where it is rich and&nbsp;fertile. Moss, marsh, and heath occur in the south-west,&nbsp;and occasionally in other quarters; but altogether they cover&nbsp;but a small proportion of the surface.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">No district in Britain is better supplied with streams, though it has only two that deserve the name of rivers, the&nbsp;Tweed and the Teviot. The Tweed, which crosses the&nbsp;northern part of the county, and for part of its course forms&nbsp;the boundary with Berwickshire, enters it from Selkirkshire on the north-west, and leaves it below Redden on the&nbsp;north-east, carrying with it nearly all the waters that pass&nbsp;through or have their source in this district. Its banks,&nbsp;especially near Kelso, where it is crossed by an elegant&nbsp;bridge, built by Rennie between the years 1799 and 1803,&nbsp;are perhaps equal in richness and beauty to those of any&nbsp;river of the same extent in Britain. The Teviot more&nbsp;properly belongs to this county, rising and terminating&nbsp;witfiin its bounds. It has its source in the south-west extremity, near the confines of Dumfriesshire, and flowing&nbsp;north-east almost through the middle of the district, joins&nbsp;the Tweed, in which its name is lost, a little above the&nbsp;town of Kelso. From Hawick downwards it is a considerable stream, and, like the Tweed, flows through a very fertile and well-cultivated country. The principal rivulets that&nbsp;fall into the Teviot from the south are Allen, Slittrick, Rule,&nbsp;Jed, Oxnam, and Kale; and from the north and west Borthwick and Ale. The Liddel and Hermitage, which run on&nbsp;the south-west, and whose united streams retain the name&nbsp;of Liddel, from which this tract is called Liddesdale, soon&nbsp;leave Roxburghshire, and after forming the boundary between Dumfriesshire and Cumberland, fall into the Esk&nbsp;above Longtown. The other streams are the Etterick,&nbsp;which joins the Tweed from the south-west as it enters&nbsp;this county; the Allen and the Leader, which fall into the&nbsp;same river from the north; and the Eden, which, after an&nbsp;easterly course, partly on the boundary with Berwickshire,&nbsp;enters the Tweed on the north-east, a little before it leaves&nbsp;the county. The Beaumont also rises here amongst the&nbsp;Cheviot Hills on the east, but after a short course passes&nbsp;by Kirk-Yetholm, and enters Northumberland. Of the&nbsp;smaller streams, the Ale, Jed, Rule, and Hermitage are&nbsp;distinguished for their natural scenery, to which we may&nbsp;add the Liddel, celebrated by the late Dr Armstrong, a&nbsp;native of Liddesdale. Tweed is the only river frequented&nbsp;by salmon, except at the time of spawning, when they are&nbsp;found in most of the other streams. Trout abounds in the&nbsp;Ale, Rule, Jed, and Kale; and there are a few small lakes&nbsp;which contain perch and pike.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Roxburghshire is by no means rich in minerals. The clay-slate or graywacke formation extends all along the&nbsp;western part, round by the top of Liddesdale, and then up&nbsp;through part of the parishes of Oxnam, Jedburgh, and Crailing. The coal series of rocks occupies nearly the whole district of Liddesdale. Trap-rock and porphyry constitute the&nbsp;formation of the eastern part, but they are also protruded&nbsp;in large masses through the clay-slate, coal, and sandstone&nbsp;formations, in all parts of the country. The old red sandstone extends along the confines of Berwickshire, down between the clay-slate and the trap-rock, to nearly the lower&nbsp;end of the parish of Hobkirk; a belt of it also intervenes&nbsp;between the coal series and the clay-slate. Two dikes of&nbsp;mountain limestone appear in Liddesdale; one a few miles&nbsp;above Castleton, and the other at Fanna Hill, at the top of&nbsp;the dale. At Carter-Fell a larger portion is found. Different kinds of agate, and sundry varieties of jasper, are also&nbsp;to be met with. Coal has been found at the Carter-Fell, in&nbsp;the southern extremity of Liddesdale, in the parishes of&nbsp;Bedrule and Linton, and in one or two other places ; but&nbsp;the workings have been so expensive in comparison with the&nbsp;value of the coal, that they have been given up. Limestone,&nbsp;which abounds in various parts, is not wrought to any extent, owing to the want of coal. There are excellent sandstone quarries at Sprouston on the Tweed, and marl in several parishes, particularly at Eckford on the Teviot, Linton&nbsp;Loch, and Ednam near the Tweed. But the use of marl as&nbsp;a manure is confined to a narrow circle around the places&nbsp;where it is found ; lime, of which a much smaller quantity&nbsp;answers the purpose, being most in request. The lime, like&nbsp;the coal, is procured from Northumberland and Mid-Lothian, being a distance of from twenty to thirty miles from&nbsp;many parts of the arable district. Coals could be procured&nbsp;nearer, at Tyne Head, and at a much cheaper rate for the&nbsp;west of the shire, if the Duke of Northumberland would&nbsp;allow a road to be made across the border, through his&nbsp;estate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The valued rent of Roxburghshire is L.314,663. 6s. 4d. Scotch, being, next to Fife and Perth, the highest in Scotland ; and the real rent of the lands, in 1811, was L.230,663.&nbsp;9s. 9d. sterling, and of the houses L.11,508. 6s. 3d. The&nbsp;annual value of real property in 1815 amounted to L.254,180.&nbsp;It is one of the few counties where the rent in sterling falls&nbsp;below the valuation in Scotch money; a circumstance which&nbsp;is certainly not owing to the want of improvements to sustain rent, nor to the present rents being too low, but to&nbsp;the mistaken vanity of its land-owners, whose rent-rolls at&nbsp;the time of the valuation are understood to have been stated too high. Of this valuation, which in 1811 was divided&nbsp;amongst three hundred and forty-nine estates, but one third&nbsp;belongs to lands under entail, and more than two thirds&nbsp;to families of the name of Kerr, Scott, Elliot, and Douglas.&nbsp;The principal proprietors are the Dukes of Roxburghe&nbsp;and Buccleuch, the Marquis of Lothian, the Earl of Minto,&nbsp;and Douglas of Cavers ; but there are thirty-three estates&nbsp;in all that have a valued rent of L.2000 each, and fifty-five&nbsp;more are from L.500 to L.2000. Yet moderate and small</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
