<p><span class="font0">thor himself chooses to furnish the solution. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ring, Oath and Conscience, Diodatis<sup>,</sup> Birth,</span><span class="font0"> the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dance of Death,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Red Dragon,</span><span class="font0"> are masterpieces in this style of invention, which, though of a sufficiently prosaic character,&nbsp;yet possesses, at least, this cardinal merit, that it is rarely&nbsp;tedious.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Historical romances have always been numerous in Germany ; and after the appearance of those of Sir Walter Scott, they became still more so. Some of the chivalrous&nbsp;pictures ofTromlitz, Van de Velde, and Blumenhagen in this&nbsp;style are spirited, but in general the historical romance of&nbsp;Germany does not rise above mediocrity. “ Sunt bona,&nbsp;sunt quædam mediocria, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">sunt mala plwα.<sup>η</sup></span><span class="font0"> Let us except&nbsp;the very remarkable tale of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Michael Kohlhaαs,</span><span class="font0"> by the unfortunate dramatist Kleist, (1776—1811). In all of Kleist’s&nbsp;tales there is too much of a spectral and fatalistic character ; he delighted to contemplate and to delineate life as</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">necessitated by a mysterious and iron destiny. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Kohlhaas </span><span class="font0">is not entirely free from a tinge of the supernatural,&nbsp;which harmonizes ill with the deep, humble, human interest of the tale itself ; and no where does the idea of a grim&nbsp;and unrelenting fate appear in more saddening colours.&nbsp;There is truth, therefore, in Goethe’s remark as to this romance, that “ it brings prominently into view a dissonant&nbsp;principle in nature, with which poetry ought not to meddle,&nbsp;with which it cannot reconcile itself, let the handling of&nbsp;the matter be never so exquisite.” And yet this vigorous&nbsp;and truthful picture from the Lutheran times, must be to&nbsp;English readers an object of interest, from the contrast it&nbsp;exhibits to the usual style of the German novel ; for it is&nbsp;told with a directness, a simplicity, a dramatic liveliness,&nbsp;and an absence of unnecessary reflection, which are qualities of rare occurrence beyond the Rhine.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">ROMAGNA, a province of Italy, in the pope’s territories, bounded on the north by the Ferrarese, on the south by Tuscany and the duchy of Urbino, on the east by the&nbsp;gulf of Venice, and on the west by the Bolognese and a part&nbsp;of Tuscany. It is fertile in corn, wine, oil, fine fruits, and&nbsp;pastures. It has also mines, mineral waters, and salt-works,&nbsp;which make its principal revenue. Ravenna is the capital&nbsp;town.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROMANIA or Rumelia, an extensive province of the Turkish empire in Europe, called by the Turks the Ejelat&nbsp;Rumili, or the land of the Romans. In the more extended&nbsp;sense it comprehends thc whole countries to the west and&nbsp;the north of the Bosphorus, but in a more peculiar sense it&nbsp;included the ancient Thrace; Bulgaria, Servia, and Greece,&nbsp;except </span><span class="font1">a </span><span class="font0">strip on the coast and the islands which are in the&nbsp;Pashalic of the Capudan Pascha, and one distinguished as the&nbsp;Ejalet Dscheseir. It is divided into 24 districts or sand-giacets, extends over 105,182 square miles, and probably&nbsp;contains 6,000,000 inhabitants. The capital of it, as of the&nbsp;empire, is Constantinople or Istambol.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROMANO, Giulio, a famous painter of the Roman school, was born at Rome in 1492. He was the favourite&nbsp;pupil of Raphael, who had such an affection for him, that he&nbsp;appointed him, with John Francis Penni, his heir. He first&nbsp;signalised himself by his Battle of Constantine, which he&nbsp;painted from a design of Raphael’s, and which was particularly admired by Poussin.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When he had completed the hall of Constantine in the Vatican, from Raphael’s designs, he went to Mantua, where&nbsp;the patronage of the Gonzaghi family excited him to those&nbsp;great works, and those magnificent plans by which Mantua&nbsp;and the palace Del T. have been so highly decorated. In&nbsp;tlle decorations of this palace, Julio prepared the cartoons,&nbsp;and had the pictures executed by his pupils ; but he afterwards corrected and finished them. Modem pencils are&nbsp;said to have covered the touches of Julio, especially in the&nbsp;Fable of Psyche, the Allegories of Human Life, and the&nbsp;Giants Storming Heaven, where his composition and design&nbsp;are alone seen. In the fresco paintings of the old palace or&nbsp;corte of Mantua, which refer principally to the histories of&nbsp;the Trojan war, his peculiar merits are better perceived.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Helen Asleep, Vulcan forging arms for Achilles, are considered beautiful, and Minerva slaying Ajax is regarded as sublime.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The most remarkable of the altar pieces of our artist are the three frescoes of St. Marco ; and in the church of St.&nbsp;Christofero, the athletic figure of that saint supporting the&nbsp;infant Jesus. His Martyrdom of St. Stephen on the head&nbsp;altar of the church of St. Stephen at Genoa, is preferred to&nbsp;them all.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">His conceptions were more extraordinary and more elevated than even those of his master, but not so natural. He was wonderful in the choice of attitudes ; but did not perfectly understand the lights and shades, and is frequently harsh&nbsp;and ungraceful. The folds ofhis draperies, says Du Fresnoy,&nbsp;are neither beautiful nor great, easy nor natural, but all extravagant, like the fantastical habits of comedians. He was,&nbsp;however, superior to most painters, by his profound knowledge of antiquity; and, by conversing with the works ofthe&nbsp;most excellent poets, particularly Homer, he made himself&nbsp;master of the qualifications necessarily required in a great&nbsp;designer. Julio Romano was also well skilled in architecture. He was employed by Cardinal de Medicis, who was&nbsp;afterwards pope under the name of Clement VII. ; he ultimately settled in Mantua, whither he was invited by Frederick Gonzago, marquis of that city, in order to avoid his&nbsp;being justly punished for having drawn at Rome the designs of twenty obscene plates, engraved by Mark Anthony,&nbsp;to which Aretine added the same number of sonnets. Julio&nbsp;Romano embellished the city of Mantua with many of his&nbsp;performances, both in painting and architecture, and died&nbsp;in that city in 1546, at 54 years of age.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Romans, a city of France, in the department of the Drome, and the arrondisement of Valence, situated on the right bank&nbsp;of the Isere. It has considerable manufactories of stockings,&nbsp;caps, hats, and silk goods, and makes large quantities of oil&nbsp;from wallnuts. The fruit, especially melons, is chiefly sent&nbsp;to Grenoble. It contained in 1836, 9285 inhabitants. Lat.&nbsp;45. 6. Long. 4. 57. E.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROMBLON or Romblino, one of the smaller Philippine islands, about 30 miles in circumference. Long. 121. 58. E. Lat. 12. 40. N.</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
