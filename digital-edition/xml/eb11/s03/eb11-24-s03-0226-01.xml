Two large streams known as the North and South Saskatchewan unite near Prince Albert, and thence flow E. into Lake Winnipeg. The North Saskatchewan rises in the Rocky Mountains in 52° 07' N. and 117° 06' W., and flows east, though with many windings, receiving several important tributaries, including the Clearwater, Brazeau and Battle. The South Saskatchewan is formed by the union of the Bow and the Belly, the former and larger of which rises in western Alberta in one of the highest districts of the Rockies. Flowing east in an extremely tortuous course, it receives the waters of the Red Deer, and farther on turns abruptly north to its junction with the other branch. The length of the united Saskatchewan is about 300 m.; shallow draught steamers ascend from its mouth to Edmonton on the North Branch, a distance of about 850 m.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
