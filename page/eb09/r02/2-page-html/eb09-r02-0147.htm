<p><span class="font0">ends inclining in opposite directions in alternate courses. The upper edges of the blocks were chamfered, and there was a chamfered groove near the bottom. In a few years this form of block&nbsp;was abandoned for rectangular blocks, and mineralized fir was substituted for beech. The blocks were bedded in Portland cement&nbsp;and laid with joints one-fourth of an inch wide, partly filled with&nbsp;asphalt and then grouted with mortar. The adoption of a bed&nbsp;of concrete as the weight-bearing foundation of the road marks a&nbsp;new departure, and in all the more recent systems of wood pavement a substantial foundation of concrete is an essential feature.&nbsp;In Norwich, however, a large quantity of wood pavement has been&nbsp;laid on the old street foundation, the blocks being bedded in gravel&nbsp;and sand and rammed, and the joints grouted with lime and sand.&nbsp;The experience of from four to seven years has proved the pavements&nbsp;to be successful, but the foundation is exceptionally dry and hard&nbsp;and the traffic not very heavy. With a concrete foundation there&nbsp;is no reason for complicated shapes and contrivances for locking&nbsp;the blocks together ; and wood pavements in their modern form&nbsp;consist of rectangular blocks (obtained by cutting off the end of a&nbsp;deal plank), bedded on the concrete with the fibres of the wood&nbsp;vertical, thus constituting a slightly elastic wearing surface on a&nbsp;rigid foundation, by which the weight of the traffic is borne. There&nbsp;is, however, considerable variation in the method of bedding and&nbsp;jointing the blocks. The Asphaltic Wood Pavement Company laid&nbsp;half an inch of asphalt upon the concrete, and formed the lower&nbsp;part of the joint of asphalt and the upper part of a grout of Portland cement and gravel, the advantage claimed being a slightly&nbsp;clastic bed for the blocks and water-tight joints. The blocks have&nbsp;been laid in unset cement over the concrete and rammed to an even&nbsp;surface ; but the ramming is liable to split the blocks, and the&nbsp;indentations formed in the cement surface of the foundation have&nbsp;to be removed when the time comes for renewing the blocks. It&nbsp;is now more usual to bed the blocks directly on the concrete, a&nbsp;smooth surface being formed either with the concrete itself or by&nbsp;a floating of cement, and to fill the joints with a grout of cement&nbsp;and gravel. A cement joint adheres to the blocks, resists wet,&nbsp;and does not wear down too much below the surface of the wood,&nbsp;and so form a receptacle for mud. In Henson’s system, which&nbsp;has been largely used, the blocks are bedded and jointed with&nbsp;ordinary roofing felt, a strip of which, cut to a width equal to the&nbsp;depth of the blocks, is placed between every two courses. The joint&nbsp;is made as close as possible by driving up the blocks as every eight&nbsp;or ten courses are laid with heavy mallets,—a plank being laid along&nbsp;the face of the work. A perfectly close and slightly elastic joint is&nbsp;thus formed. A continuous layer of felt is likewise laid over the&nbsp;concrete foundation to give a slightly elastic bed to the blocks. A&nbsp;V-shaped groove along the centre of every fourth block was at&nbsp;first considered necessary for foothold, but its use has been discontinued except on gradients steeper than 1 in 30. The surface&nbsp;of the pavement is dressed over with a hot bituminous compound,&nbsp;and covered with fine clean grit. This method of laying a wood&nbsp;pavement, although somewhat more expensive, is probably the&nbsp;best that has hitherto been devised for smoothness and durability.&nbsp;The blocks are laid in courses across the streets, any change in&nbsp;the direction of the latter being accommodated by shorter courses&nbsp;ending with wedge-shaped blocks. At street junctions the courses&nbsp;are laid diagonally, or meeting at right angles. Two or three&nbsp;courses are laid parallel with the kerb to form a water channel.&nbsp;The blocks may be laid close end to end across the street if some&nbsp;allowance be made for expansion by wet, without which the kerbstones and footways will be displaced, or the courses will be bent&nbsp;in reversed curves. To afford relief the joints of the courses parallel&nbsp;to the kerb may be left open, or the course next the kerb may be&nbsp;left out until expansion has ceased, the space being temporarily&nbsp;filled in with sand. In the direction of the traffic joints more or&nbsp;less wide are generally thought necessary for foothold. A wide&nbsp;joint allows the fibres of the wood to spread and give way at the&nbsp;upper corner of the blocks for want of lateral support, and it also&nbsp;forms a receptacle for mud and wet. Experience has shown that&nbsp;the space of three-fourths of an inch or one inch, once thought&nbsp;necessary for foothold, may safely be reduced to one-fourth or&nbsp;three - eighths of an inch. For spacing the courses to form the&nbsp;joints strips of wood of the proper thickness may be laid in and&nbsp;removed before the joints are filled, or they may be nailed to the&nbsp;lower part of the blocks. Two fillets have been nailed on, or three&nbsp;cast-iron studs fixed in the sides of each block to keep them steady&nbsp;in place until the joints are filled and thoroughly set. The latter&nbsp;method secures more uniformity in the width of the joints.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There is some difference of opinion as to the best material for a wood pavement. Pitch pine and the harder red and yellow deals&nbsp;are the most durable, but they are less elastic than the softer woods,&nbsp;and are apt to wear slippery. Soft white woods have been recommended for the sake of a more elastic surface ; but on the whole&nbsp;either Memel or Swedish yellow deal is generally considered the best&nbsp;material. Whatever wood is used, it should be sound, close-grained,&nbsp;even in quality, free from knots and sap, and from the blue tinge&nbsp;which is a sign of incipient decay. After the blocks are cut, all&nbsp;those that are unsound, knotty, or badly shaped should be carefully rejected, as defective blocks soon cause holes in the surface&nbsp;and must be replaced, or the adjoining blocks will suffer undue&nbsp;wear and the surface become irregular. The breadth of the blocks&nbsp;never now exceeds 4 inches, and it is generally 3, the length being&nbsp;determined by the breadth of the deal or batten from which they&nbsp;are cut. The depth is usually 5 or 6 inches ; 5 inches are considered by many to be enough to give sufficient depth for as long&nbsp;as the pavement will retain a sufficiently good surface without&nbsp;renewing the wood, and blocks of that depth have been laid in&nbsp;many London streets. It is doubtful if any advantage is derived&nbsp;from creasoting or from dipping the blocks in creasote oil or coal&nbsp;tar. Dipping affords a cover for the use of defective or inferior&nbsp;wood, and thorough creasoting, though it preserves the wood from&nbsp;decay, has little or no influence on the wear, which in almost all&nbsp;cases determines the life of the blocks.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With a curved cross section like that already described a rise from the mean level of the channels to the crown of the road equal&nbsp;to one-sixtieth or one-seventieth of the width of the carriage-way&nbsp;is enough. The necessary profile must be accurately given to the&nbsp;concrete foundation when wet. Wooden moulds or templates are&nbsp;fixed across the street 10 or 12 feet apart, over which a straight&nbsp;batten is worked to give the concrete the required form and a&nbsp;smooth surface. The moulds are removed when the concrete is&nbsp;partially set and the spaces are made good with cement mortar.&nbsp;In a level street provision should be made in the foundation for a&nbsp;fall in the side channels towards the gullies of not less than 1 in&nbsp;150, and the necessary modifications of cross section at the intersection of streets must also be provided for. Every care should be&nbsp;taken to ensure a good homogeneous concrete for the foundation,&nbsp;as upon that the strength of the road depends. With a well-made&nbsp;Portland cement concrete a thickness of 6 inches is sufficient. It&nbsp;should be allowed to set thoroughly before the blocks are laid,&nbsp;and traffic should not be allowed to pass over it for a week. The&nbsp;finished pavement should be covered with a thin layer of sharp&nbsp;grit, which is forced into the wood by the traffic and forms a hard&nbsp;face. Several applications of grit are desirable at first, and from&nbsp;time to time afterwards, both as a protection to the wood and to&nbsp;prevent slipperiness. Systematic cleansing is required to prevent&nbsp;slipperiness and foul smells, and to preserve the pavement. Cleansing may be aided by washing, and when it is thoroughly carried&nbsp;out but little watering is required to keep down the dust. A wood&nbsp;pavement is the quietest for the residents, pleasant to travel over,&nbsp;and favourable to the wear of vehi les. Traction on it is easy and&nbsp;foothold good, so that it may be laid on gradients as steep as 1 in 20.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The wear of wood pavements in London is stated by Mr Stayton to be from Ό65 inch per year in Sloane Street, with a traffic of 279&nbsp;tons per yard of width per day, to '456 inch per year in Fleet Street,&nbsp;with a traffic of 1360 tons per yard of width per day. Reduced to&nbsp;a standard of traffic of 750 tons per yard per day, the comparative&nbsp;annual wear becomes <sup>,</sup>175 in the former and ‘251 in the latter street.&nbsp;In Parliament Street, Westminster, blocks removed after four years&nbsp;in places where patching was required had lost 1⅛ to 1⅛ inches in&nbsp;thickness, equal to one-third of an inch per year under traffic stated&nbsp;to be 1106 tons per yard of width per day. From information&nbsp;afforded by Mr Haywood it appears that in the City of London&nbsp;under traffic of from 300 to 660 vehicles per yard of width per&nbsp;day of 12 hours the wear is from '2 to <sup>,</sup>3 inch per year, and that in&nbsp;King William Street, London Bridge, under a traffic of about 1200&nbsp;vehicles per yard of width in 12 hours the wear was found to be&nbsp;2 j inches in 3⅛ years in the middle of the road, or ’81 inch per year.&nbsp;This is the heaviest traffic to which wood pavement has been subjected. The wear is generally considered to be as much due to the&nbsp;horses’ feet as to the wheels, and the action of the former is more&nbsp;destructive on steep gradients. Towards the end of the life of the&nbsp;blocks the wear is more rapid than at first. Few’ wood pavements&nbsp;retain a sufficiently good surface after about six years’ wear without&nbsp;extensive repairs, and it is probably not advantageous to lay blocks&nbsp;of a greater depth than will provide for a duration of seven years ;&nbsp;5 inches are almost always sufficient for this.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Wood pavements of plain blocks on a cement concrete bed are now’ (1885) laid at from 10s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. per square yard, a considerable reduction on the prices paid for patented systems a few&nbsp;years ago. Of the above prices 2s. 3d. to 3s. 9d. is the cost of the&nbsp;foundation, which does not require renewal like the blocks. Assuming the average life of the latter to be seven years, Mr Stayton&nbsp;estimates the annual cost of wood paving in Chelsea with a traffic&nbsp;of 500 to 750 tons per yard of width per (lay to be Is. 9d. per square&nbsp;yard, which includes the cost of original construction, repairs and&nbsp;renewals, and interest, spread over fifteen years. Cleansing and&nbsp;sanding are estimated to cost 5d. per square yard in addition.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Asphalt Paving.—Asphalt was first used for street paving in Paris in 1854. It was introduced in London in 1869, when Thread-needle Street was paved by the Val de Travers Asphalt Company,,&nbsp;and since then it has been extensively used for paving both streets&nbsp;and footways. The material is a hard limestone impregnated with&nbsp;bitumen in the proportion of from 6 to 8 per cent, in the Seyssel</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
