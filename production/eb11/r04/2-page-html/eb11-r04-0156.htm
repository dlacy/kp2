<p><span class="font0">with the government, could only return to Rome with the aid of the Normans. Being now absorbed in the great investiture&nbsp;question, he had recourse to a daring plan. He proposed to&nbsp;Henry V. that the bishops should resign all property derived&nbsp;from the crown and depend solely on tithes and donations,&nbsp;while the empire should resign the right of investiture. Henry&nbsp;seemed disposed to accept the suggestion, but, suddenly changing his mind, took the pope prisoner and forced him to yield&nbsp;the right of investiture and to give him the crown (mi). But&nbsp;the following year the party of reform annulled in council this&nbsp;concession, which the pope declared to have been extorted by&nbsp;force. By the death of Countess Matilda in 1115 and the&nbsp;bequest of her vast possessions to the Holy See, the pope’s&nbsp;dominions were greatly enlarged, but his authority as a ruler was&nbsp;nowise increased. Deeds of violence still continued in Rome;&nbsp;and then followed the death of the prefect Pietro. The nobles&nbsp;of the imperial party, joined with the people, wished to elect&nbsp;Pietro’s son, also nephew to Tolomeo of Tusculum, who then&nbsp;held the position of a potent imperial margrave, had territories&nbsp;stretching from the Sabine mountains to the sea, was the&nbsp;dictator of Tusculum, master of Latium and consul of the&nbsp;Romans. The pope opposed this election to the best of his&nbsp;strength; but the nobles carried the day, and their new prefect&nbsp;received investiture from the emperor. Upon this the pope&nbsp;again quitted Rome, and on his return, two years later, was&nbsp;compelled to shut himself up in the castle of St Angelo, where&nbsp;he died in 1118.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The popes were now the sport of the nobles whom they had aggrandized by continual concessions for the sake of peace.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">And peace seemed at hand when Innocent II. (1130-43), after triumphing over two antipopes, came to terms&nbsp;with Roger I., recognized him as king of Sicily, and&nbsp;gained his friendship and protection. But now still&nbsp;graver tumults took place. In consequence of the division of&nbsp;the nobles neither party could overcome its foes without the&nbsp;aid of the people, which thus became increasingly powerful.&nbsp;Throughout upper and central Italy the cities were being&nbsp;organized as free and independent communes on a democratic&nbsp;basis. Their example soon followed in the ancient duchy of&nbsp;Rome and almost in the immediate neignbourhood of the&nbsp;city. Even Tivoli was converted into a republic. This excited&nbsp;the deepest jealousy in the Romans, arid they became furious&nbsp;when this little city, profiting by its strong position in the Tever-one valley, not only sought to annex Roman territory, but&nbsp;dared to offer successful resistance to the descendants of the&nbsp;conquerors of the world. In 1141 Tivoli openly rebelled&nbsp;against the mother city, and the pope sent the Romans to&nbsp;subdue it. They were not only repulsed, but ignominiously&nbsp;pursued to their own gates. Afterwards, returning to the&nbsp;assault in greater numbers, they conquered the hostile town.&nbsp;Its defenders surrendered to the pope, and he immediately&nbsp;concluded a treaty of peace without consulting either the&nbsp;people or the republic. The soldiery, still flushed with victory,&nbsp;were furious at this slight. They demanded not only submission of Tivoli to the Roman people, but also permission to&nbsp;demolish its walls and dwellings and expel its population.&nbsp;Innocent II. refused consent to these excesses, and a memorable&nbsp;revolution ensued by which the temporal power of the papacy&nbsp;was entirely overthrown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1143 the rebellious people rushed to the Capitol, proclaimed the republic, reconstituted the senate, to the almost entire exclusion of the nobles, declared the abolition&nbsp;of the temporal power, issued coin inscribed to the&nbsp;senate, the people and St Peter, and began to reckon&nbsp;time from the day of the restoration of liberty.' Arnold&nbsp;of Brescia was not, as has been incorrectly stated, the&nbsp;author of this revolution, for he had not yet arrived in&nbsp;Rome. It was the outcome of an historic necessity&nbsp;—above all, of the renewed vigour of the people and its detestation of the feudal aristocracy. .This body, besides being divided&nbsp;into an imperial and a national party, had almost excluded&nbsp;from the government the powerful baronage of the Campagna</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font0">and the provinces. Also, as we have before noted, the Roman aristocracy was by no means an exclusive caste. Between the&nbsp;great aristocrats and the people there stood a middle or new&nbsp;nobility, which made common cause with the people, whose&nbsp;chief strength now lay in the army. This, divided into twelve&nbsp;and then into thirteen or fourteen regions, assembled under its&nbsp;banners all arm-bearing citizens. Thus the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">exercitus</span><span class="font0"> was also&nbsp;the real </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">populus Romanns,</span><span class="font0"> now bent on the destruction of the&nbsp;temporal power. This purpose, originating in the struggle of&nbsp;the investitures, was the logical and inevitable result of thè&nbsp;proposals of Paschal II., which, despite their rejection, found&nbsp;a loud echo in Italy. Lucius II. (1144-45) tried to withstand&nbsp;the revolution by seeking Norman aid and throwing himself into&nbsp;the arms of the feudal party, but this only precipitated the&nbsp;course of events. The people, after having excluded nearly&nbsp;all aristocrats from the senate, now placed at its head the noble&nbsp;Giordano dei Pierleoni, who had joined the revolutionary party.&nbsp;They named him patrician, but without prejudice to the&nbsp;authority of the empire, still held by them in respect, and also&nbsp;conferred on him the judicial powers appertaining to the aristocratic and imperial office of prefect. The pope was requested&nbsp;to resign the temporal power, the regalia and every other&nbsp;possession, and content himself with the tithes and offerings of&nbsp;the faithful according to the scheme of Paschal II. He indignantly refused, marched at the head of the nobles against the&nbsp;Capitol, but was violently repulsed, and received a blow on the&nbsp;head from a stone, which is supposed to have occasioned his&nbsp;speedy death on the 15th February 1145. Eugenius III was&nbsp;then elected (1145-53), but soon had to fly to Viterbo in quest&nbsp;of armed assistance, in consequence of the senate’s resolve to&nbsp;prevent his consecration by force until he recognized the new&nbsp;state of things in the Eternal City.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It was at this moment that Arnold of Brescia arrived in Rome. His ideas, already well known in Italy, had inspired&nbsp;and promoted the Roman revolution, and he now&nbsp;came to determine its method and direction. Born&nbsp;at Brescia in the beginning of the 12th century, Arnold&nbsp;had studied in France under the celebrated Abelard, who had&nbsp;instructed him in theology and philosophy, inspired him with&nbsp;a great love for antiquity, and stimulated his natural independence of mind. On returning to his native land he assumed the&nbsp;monkish habit, and proved the force and fervour of his character&nbsp;by taking part in all struggles for liberty. And, together with&nbsp;political reform, he preached his favourite doctrine of thè&nbsp;necessary renunciation by the clergy of all temporal wealth.&nbsp;Expounded with singular eloquence, these doctrines had a&nbsp;stirring effect on men’s minds, spread throughout the cities of&nbsp;northern Italy, and were echoed on all sides. It seems undoubted that they penetrated to Rome and helped to promòte&nbsp;the revolution, so that Arnold was already present in spirit&nbsp;before he arrived there in person. It is known that at the&nbsp;Lateran council of 1139 Innocent II. had declared these doctrines&nbsp;to be inimical to the church and enjoined silence on their author.&nbsp;And, as at that time the party hostile to liberty was triumphant&nbsp;in Brescia, Arnold left his native place, crossed the Alps and&nbsp;returned to France, where other struggles awaited him. He&nbsp;professed no anti-Catholic dogmas,—only maintaining that&nbsp;when the pope and the prelacy deviated from the gospel rule of&nbsp;poverty they should not be obeyed, but fearlessly opposed. In&nbsp;France, finding his master, Abelard, exposed to the persecutions of St Bernard, he assumed his defence with so&nbsp;much ardour that St Bernard directed the thunders of&nbsp;his eloquence against the disciple as well as the master,&nbsp;saying of the former, “ He neither eats nor drinks, suffers&nbsp;hunger, and, being leagued with the devil, only thirsts for&nbsp;the blood of souls.” In 1142 we find Arnold a wanderer in&nbsp;Switzerland, and then, suddenly reappearing in Italy, he&nbsp;arrived in Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Three different elements entered into his nature and inspired his eloquence—an exalted and mystic temperament, a great and&nbsp;candid admiration for classic antiquity added to an equal&nbsp;admiration for republican freedom independent of the church</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
