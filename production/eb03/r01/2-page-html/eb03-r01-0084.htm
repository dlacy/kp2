<p><span class="font0">Regiments were ſirſt formed in France in the year 1558, and in England in the year 1660.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REGIOMONTANUS. See Muller.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REGION, in geography, a large extent oſ land, in-habited by many people of the ſame nation, and incloſed within certain limits or bounds.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The modern aſtronomers divide the moon into ſeveral regions, or large tracts of land, to each of which they&nbsp;give its proper name.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Region, in phyſiology, is taken for a diviſion of our ■atmoſphere, which is divided into the upper, middle, and&nbsp;Iower regions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The upper region commences from the tops of the -mountains, and reaches to the utmoſt limits of the at-moſphere. In this region reign a perpetual, equable,&nbsp;calmneſs, clearneſs, and ſerenity. The middle region&nbsp;is that in which the clouds reſide, and where meteors&nbsp;are formed, extending from the extremity of the loweſt&nbsp;to the tops of the higheſt mountains. The loweſt region is that in which we breathe, which is bounded by&nbsp;the reflection of thc fun’s rays ; or by the height to&nbsp;which they rebound from the earth. See Atmosphere&nbsp;and Air.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Æthereal Region,</span><span class="font0"> in cofmography, is the whole ex-tent of the univerſe, in which is included all the heavenly bodies, and even the orb of the fixed ſtars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Elementary Region,</span><span class="font0"> according to the Ariſtotelians, is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">ſphere terminated by the concavity of the moon’s orb,&nbsp;comprehending the atmoſphere of the earth.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Region, in anatomy, a diviſion of the human body, otherwiſe ealled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">cavity,</span><span class="font0"> of which anatomiſts reckon three,&nbsp;viz. the upper region, or that of the head ; the middle&nbsp;region, that of the thorax or breaſt ; and the lower, the&nbsp;abdomen, or belly. See Anatomy.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Region, in ancient Rome, was a part or diviſton of •the city. The regions were only four in number, till&nbsp;Auguſtus Cæiar’s time, who divided the city into fourteen ; over each of which he fettled two furveyors, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curatores viarum,</span><span class="font0"> who were appointed annually,&nbsp;and took their diviſions by lot. Theſe fourteen regions&nbsp;contained four hundred and twenty-four ſtreets, thirty-one of which were called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">greater</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">royal Jlreets,</span><span class="font0"> which&nbsp;began at the gilt pillar that ſtood at the entry of the&nbsp;open place, in the middle of the city. The extent of&nbsp;theſe diviſions varied greatly, ſome being from 12000&nbsp;or 13000 to 33000 feet or upwards in circumference.&nbsp;Authors, however, are not agreed as to the exact limits&nbsp;of each. The curatores viarum wore the purple, had&nbsp;each two lictors in their proper divilions, had ſlaves under them .to take care of fires, that happened to break&nbsp;■out. They had alſo two officers, called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">denunciatores,</span><span class="font0"> in&nbsp;each region, to give account of any diſorders. Four&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">vιco-rnagijlri</span><span class="font0"> alſo were appointed in each ſtreet, who&nbsp;took care of the ſtreets allotted them, and carried the&nbsp;orders of the city to each citizen.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">REGIS 1ER, a public book, in which are entered and recorded memoirs, acts, and minutes, to be had recourſe to occafionally for knowing and proving matters&nbsp;of fact. Οί theſe there are ſeveral kinds ; as,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">i. Regiſter of deeds in Yorkſhire and Middleſex, in which are regiſtered all deeds, conveyances, wills, &amp;c\&nbsp;-that affect any lands or tenements in thoſe counties,&nbsp;which are otherwife void againſt any ſubfequent pur-■chafers or mortgagees, &amp;c. but this does not extend to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">any copyhold eſtate, nor to leaſes at a rack-rent, or&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">where they do not exceed 21 years.

But theſe&nbsp;regiſters, which are confined to two counties, are in&nbsp;Scotland general, by which the laws of North Britain&nbsp;are rendered very eaſy and regular. Οί theſe there are&nbsp;two kinds ; the one general, fixed at Edinburgh, under&nbsp;the direction of the lord-regiſter ; and the other is kept&nbsp;in the ſeveral ſhires, ſtewartries, and regalities, the clerks&nbsp;of which are obliged to tranſmit the regiſters of their&nbsp;reſpective courts to the general regiſter.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">2. Pariſſi-regiſters are books in which are regiſtered the baptifms, marriages, and burials, of each pariſli.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Registers were kept both at Athens and Rome, in which were inferted the names of ſuch children&nbsp;as were to be brought up, as foon as they were born.&nbsp;Marcus Aurelius required all free perſons to give in&nbsp;accounts of their children, within 30 days after the&nbsp;birth, to the treaſurer of the empire, in order to their&nbsp;being depofited in the temple of Saturn, where the&nbsp;public acts were kept, officers were alſo appointed aa&nbsp;public regiſters in the provinces, that recourſe might be&nbsp;had to their lifts of names, for ſettling diſputes, or pro-ving any perſon’s freedom.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;font-variant:small-caps;">Register Ships,</span><span class="font0"> in commerce, are veffels which ob-tain a permiſſion either from the king of Spain, or the council of the Indies, to traffic in the ports of the Spaniſh weft Indies ; which are thus called, from their being regiſtered before they ſet ſail from Cadiz for Buenos&nbsp;Ayres.</span></p>

Flaminius ; but whence it was ſurnamed </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Regium</span><span class="font0"> is&nbsp;altogether uncertain. Tacitus relates, that at the battle&nbsp;of Bedriacum, a bird of an unuſual ſize was ſeen perching in a famous grove near Regium Lepidum.
