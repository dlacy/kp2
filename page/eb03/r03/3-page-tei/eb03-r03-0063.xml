A pretty good edition of his <hi rend="italic">Select Pieces</hi>  appeared at Paris in 1741, in a ſmall 12mo volume. His portrait, engraved by the celebrated Aved, his old friend, made its appearance in 1778, with the following motto from Martial :</p><p><hi rend="italic">Certior in ηoβro carmine vultus grit.</hi></p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rousseau (John-James), was born at Geneva June 28. 17 12. Plis father was by prdfeſſion a clock and watch maker. At his birth, which, he ſays, was the firſt of his misfortunes, he endangered the life of his mother, and he himſelf was for a long time after in a very weak and languiſhing ſtate of health ; but as his bodily' ſtrength increaſed, his mental powers gradually opened, and afforded the happſeſt preſages of future greatnefs. His father, who was a citizen of Geneva, was a well-informed tradeſman ; and in the place where he wrought he kept a Plutarch and a Tacitus, and theſe authors of courſe ſoon became familiar to his ſon. A raſh juvenile ſtep occaſioned his leaving his father’s houſe. “ Finding himſelf a fugitive, in a ſtrange country, and without money or friends, he changed (ſays he himſelf) his religion, in order to procure a ſubſiſtence.” Bornex, biſhop of Anneci, from whom he fought an aſylum, committed the care of his education to Madame de Warrens, an ingenious and amiable lady, who hſtd in 1726 left part of her wealth, and the Proteſtant religion, in order to throw herſelf into the boſom of the church. This generous lady ſerved in the triple capacity of a mother, a friend, and a lover, to the new proſelyte, whom ſhe regarded as her ſon. Hie neceſſity of procuring for himſelf ſome ſettlement, however, or perhaps his unſettled diſ-poſition, obliged Rouffeau often to leave this tendhr mother.</hi></p><p>He poffeffed more than ordinary talents for muſic ; and the Abbé Blanchard flattered his hopes with a place in the royal chapel, which he, however, failed in obtaining for him ; he was therefore under the neceſſity of teaching muſic at Chamberi. He remained in this place till 1741, in which year he went to Paris, where he w<hi rend="sup">r</hi>as long in very deſtitute circumſtances. Writing to a friend in 1743, he thus exprefſes himſelf: *<hi rend="sup">,</hi> Every thing is dear here, but eſpecially bread.” What an expreſſion ; and to what may not genius be reduced ! Meanwhile he now began to emerge from that obſcurity in which he had hitherto been buried. His friends placed him with M. de Montaigu, ambaſe ſador from France to Venice. According to his own confeſſion, a proud miſanthropy and a peculiar contempt of the riches and pleaſures of this world, conſtituted the chief traits in his character, and a miſun-derſtanding ſoon took place between him and the am-baffador. The place of depute, under M. Dupin, farmer-general, a man of conſiderable parts, gave him ſome temporary relief, and enabled him to be of ſome benefit to Madam de Warrens his former benefactreſs. lhe year 17 ςo was the commencement of his literary career. The academy of Dijon had propoſed the following queſtion : “ Whether the<hi rend="italic">∣ evival</hi>  of the arts and ſciences has contributed to the refinement of manners?” Rouffeau at fiiſt inclined to ſupport the affirmative. « This is the <hi rend="italic">pons aβ'dorum</hi>  (ſays a phιlυlopher, at that time a friend of his), take the negative fide of∖the queſtion, and I’ll promiſe you the greateſt ſucceſs,”</p><p>His diſcourſe againſt the ſciences, accordingly, having been found to be the beſt written, and replete with the dcepeſt reaſoning, was publicly crowned with the approbation of that learned body. Never was a paradox ſupported with more eloquence ; it was not however a,nt- one; but he enriched it with all the advantages which either knowledge or genius could confer on it. Immediately after its appearance, he met with ſeveral opponents of<hi rend="sup">z</hi>his tenets, which he de-fended ; and from one diſpute to another, he found himſelf involved in a formidable train of correſpon-deπce, without having ever almoſt dreamed of ſuch oppoſition. From that period he decreaſed in happineſs as he increaſed in celebrity. His “ Diſcourſe on the cauſes of inequality among mankind, and on the origin of ſocial compacts,” a work full of almoſt unintelligible maxims and wild ideas, was written with a view to prove that mankind are equal ; that they were born to live apart from each other ; and that they have perverted the order of nature in forming ſocieties. He bellows the higheſt praiie on the ſtate of nature, and depreciates the idea of every ſocial compact. This dilcourſe, and eſpecially the dedication of<hi rend="italic">it to</hi>  the republic of Geneva, are the <hi rend="italic">chef-Lœuvres</hi>  of that kind of eloquence of which the ancients alone had given us any idea. By preſenting this performance to the ma-giſtrates, he was received again into his native country, and reinſtated in all the privileges and rights of a citizen, after having with much difficulty prevailed on himſelf to abjure the Catholic religion. He ſoon, however, returned to France, and lived for ſome time in Paris. He afterwards gave himſelf up to retirement, to eſeape the ſhafts of criticiſm, and follow after the regimen which the ſtrangury, with which he was tormented, demanded of him. This is an important epoch in the hiilory of his life, as it is owing to this circum-ftance, perhaps, that we have the moſt elegant works that have come from his pen. His “ Letter to M. d’Alembert” on the deſign of erecting a theatre at Geneva, written in his retirement, and publiſhed in‘ 1757, contains, along with ſome paradoxes, ſome very important and well-handled truths. This letter firſt drew down upon him the envy of Voltaire, and was the cauſe of thoſe indignities with which that author never ceaſed to load him. What is fingular in him, is, that althouglι ſo great an enemy to theatrical reprefen--tations himſelf, he cauſed a comedy to be printed, and in 1752 gave to the theatre a paſtoral (The Village Conjuror), of which he compoſed both the poetry and muſic, both of them abounding with ſentiment and elegance, and full of innocent and rural ſimplicity. What renders the Village Conjuror highly delightful to perſons of taſte, is that perfect harmony of words and muſic which everywhere pervades it ; that proper connection among the parties who compoſe it ; and its being perfectly correct from beginning to end. The muſician hath ſpoken, hath thought, and felt like a poet. Everything in it is agreeable, interefting, and far ſuperior to thole common affected and inſipid productions of our modern petit-oramas. His Dictionary of Muſic affords ſeveral excellent articles; ſome of them, however, are very inaccurate. “ This work (ſays M. la Borde), in his Effay on Muſic, has need to be written over again, to fave much trouble to thoſe who wiſh to ſtudy it, arid prevent them from falling into errors, which</p><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
