<p><span class="font1">emperor was lord over church and state. This, however, stirred both people and pope against him, and led to the&nbsp;terrible contest of the investitures, although for the moment&nbsp;the Romans, being exlιausted by past calamities, seemed&nbsp;not only resigned but contented.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In fact, the idea of reform and independence was already germinating in the church and was soon to become&nbsp;tenacious and irresistible. Hildebrand was the prompter&nbsp;and hero of this idea. He sought to abolish the simony&nbsp;and concubinage of the priesthood, to give the papal&nbsp;elections into the hands of the higher ecclesiastics, and to&nbsp;emancipate the church from all dependence on the empire.&nbsp;Henry III. procured the election of four German popes in&nbsp;succession, and Hildebrand was always at hand to inspire&nbsp;their actions and dominate them by his strength of intellect and still greater strength of will. But the fourth&nbsp;German pope, Victor IL, died in 1057, and Henry III.&nbsp;had been succeeded in 1056 by the young Henry IV.&nbsp;under the regency of a weak woman, the empress Agnes.&nbsp;Hildebrand seized this favourable moment for trying&nbsp;his strength and procured the election of Stephen IX.&nbsp;(1057-58), a candidate he had long had in view. Stephen,&nbsp;however, died in 1058 ; the nobles instantly rose in&nbsp;rebellion ; and Gregory of Tusculum, who had assumed the&nbsp;patriciate, caused an incapable cousin to be named pope&nbsp;(Benedict X.). Upon this Hildebrand postponed his design&nbsp;of maintaining the papacy by the help of Italian potentates&nbsp;and had recourse to the empress. In a synod held at&nbsp;Siena with her consent Benedict was deposed and Nicholas</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. (1059-61) elected in his stead. This pope entered&nbsp;Rome escorted by the troops of Godfrey of Tuscany, and,&nbsp;when also assured of help from Naples, assembled a council&nbsp;of one hundred and thirteen bishops (1059), who condemned&nbsp;the deposed pontiff and renewed the prohibition of simony&nbsp;and concubinage among the priesthood. Finally Nicholas&nbsp;instituted the college of cardinals, entrusting it with the&nbsp;election of the pope, who was in future to be chosen from&nbsp;its ranks. The assent of the clergy and people was left&nbsp;purely formal. The decree also contained the proviso—&nbsp;“saving the honour and reverence due to the emperor”;&nbsp;but this too was an empty expression.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The new decree was a master-stroke of Hildebrand’s genius, for by means of it he placed the papal election&nbsp;in the hands of a genuine ecclesiastical senate and gave a&nbsp;monarchical form to the church. Backed by the Normans&nbsp;who were in Rome, and whose commander, Richard of&nbsp;Capua, did not scruple to strike off the heads of many&nbsp;recalcitrant nobles, Hildebrand and the pope could now&nbsp;pursue their work of reform. Nevertheless the nobles&nbsp;again revolted on the death of Nicholas II. in 1061, and&nbsp;declared their purpose of restoring to Henry IV. the patriciate and right of election ; but Hildebrand, by speedily&nbsp;convoking the cardinals, procured the election of Alexander</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">II. (1061-73). This pope, although friendly to the empire,&nbsp;did not await the imperial sanction, but, protected by&nbsp;the Romans, at once entered the Lateran and put some&nbsp;other riotous nobles to death. The German bishops, however, elected Honorius IL, who had the support of the&nbsp;barons. Thus the city was split into two camps and a&nbsp;deadly civil war ensued, terminating, despite the vigorous&nbsp;resistance of the nobility, in the defeat of Honorius II.&nbsp;But the nobles persevered in the contest and were the real&nbsp;masters of Rome. By conferring the patriciate on the&nbsp;emperor, as their feudal chief, they hoped to organize themselves under the prefect, who now, with greatly increased&nbsp;authority, presided over both the civil and criminal courts&nbsp;in the absence of the pope’s representative. In a general&nbsp;assembly the Romans elected their prefect, whose investiture was granted by the emperor, while the pope elected&nbsp;another. Thus disorder was brought to a climax,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Alexander died on the 21st April 1073, and thereupon </span><span class="font0">∣</span><span class="font1"> Hildebrand was at last raised to the chair as pope Gregory&nbsp;VIL (1073-85). He reconfirmed his predecessors’ decrees, dismissed all simoniacal and non-celibate priests, and&nbsp;then in a second council (1075) forbade the clergy to&nbsp;receive investiture at the hands of laymen. No bishop nor&nbsp;abbot was again to accept ring or crozier from king or&nbsp;emperor. Now, as ecclesiastical dignities included the&nbsp;possession of extensive benefices, privileges, and feudal&nbsp;rights, this decree gave rise to tremendous dispute and to&nbsp;fierce contest between the empire and the church. The&nbsp;nobles took a very decided part in the struggle. With&nbsp;Cenci, their former prefect, at their head, they rose in&nbsp;revolt, assailed the pope on Christmas day 1075, and threw&nbsp;him into prison. But their fear of the popular wrath compelled his speedy release; and he then decreed the excommunication and deposition of the emperor who had declared&nbsp;him deposed. That monarch afterwards made submission&nbsp;to Gregory at Canossa (1077), but, again turning against&nbsp;him, was again excommunicated. And in 1081 he returned to Italy bringing the antipope Clement III., and&nbsp;besieged Rome for forty days. Assembling the nobles in&nbsp;his camp, he there arranged a new government of the city&nbsp;with prefect and senate, palatine judges, and other magistrates, exactly similar to the existing government within&nbsp;the walls. He then took his departure, returned several&nbsp;times in vain, but at last forced his way into the city&nbsp;(March 1084), and compelled Gregory VII. to seek refuge&nbsp;in Castle St Angelo. The emperor was then master&nbsp;of Rome, established the government he had previously&nbsp;arranged, and, calling a parliament of nobles and bishops,&nbsp;procured the deposition of Gregory and the consecration&nbsp;of Clement III., by whom he was crowned in 1084. He&nbsp;then attacked and seized the Capitol, and assaulted the&nbsp;castle in order to capture the pope. But Robert Guiscard&nbsp;brought his army to the rescue. Emperor and anti-pope&nbsp;fled ; the city was taken, the pope liberated, and Rome&nbsp;reduced to ruin by fire and pillage. Upon this Gregory&nbsp;VII., broken with grief, went away with the Normans, and&nbsp;died at Salerno on the 25th May 1085. He had separated&nbsp;the church from the people and the empire by a struggle&nbsp;that, as Gregorovius says, disturbed the deep sleep of the&nbsp;Middle Ages</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Pope Paschal II. (1099-1118) found himself entirely at the mercy of the tyrannous nobles who were alike&nbsp;masters of Rome, of its government, and its spiritual&nbsp;lord. As they were divided among themselves, all the&nbsp;pope could do was to side with one party in order to&nbsp;overcome the other. With the help of his own nephew&nbsp;Gualfredo, the prefect Pietro Pierleone, and the Frangipani,&nbsp;he Avas able to keep down the Corsi, and hold the Colonna&nbsp;in check. Beingcompelled to repair to Benevento in 1108,&nbsp;he left Gualfredo to command the militia, Tolomeo of&nbsp;Tusculum to guard the Campagna, and the consuls Pierleone&nbsp;and Leone Frangipani, together Avith the prefect, in charge&nbsp;of the government. The consulship was no longer a mere&nbsp;title of honour. The consuls seem to have been elected,&nbsp;as at Ravenna, in imitation of those of the Lombard cities,&nbsp;and were at the head of the nobles and senate. The&nbsp;expressions “praefectus et consules,” “de senatoribus et&nbsp;consulibus, ” are now of frequent occurrence. We have&nbsp;no precise knowledge of the political organization of the&nbsp;city at this moment ; but it was an aristocratic government,&nbsp;similar to that originally formed in Florence, as Villani&nbsp;tells us, Avith a senate and consuls. The nobles were so&nbsp;completely the masters that the pope, in spite of having&nbsp;trusted them Avitlι the government, could only return to&nbsp;Rome Avith the aid of the Normans. Being iioav absorbed&nbsp;in the great investiture question, he had recourse to a&nbsp;daring plan. He proposed to Henry V. that the bishops</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
