<p><span class="font1">RAVILLIAC (Francis), the infamous aſſaſſin of .Henry IV. of France, was a native of Angouleſme,&nbsp;and at the time of his execution was about one or two&nbsp;and thirty years of age. See France, n<sup>0</sup> 146, and&nbsp;Henry IV. of France. Ravilliac was the ſon of pa-rents who lived upon alms. His father was that ſovt&nbsp;of inferior retainer to .the law, to which the vulgar&nbsp;give the name of a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pettifogger,</span><span class="font1"> and his fon had been&nbsp;bred up in the ſame way. Ravilliac had ſet up a claim&nbsp;to an eſtate, but the cauſe went againſt him : this diſappointment affected his mind deeply : he afterwards&nbsp;taught a fchool, and, as himſelf ſaid, received chari-table gifts, though but of a very ſmall value, from the&nbsp;parents of thoſe whom he taught ; and yet his diſtreſs&nbsp;was ſo great, that he had much ado to live, when&nbsp;he was ſeized for the king’s murder, he was very looſely&nbsp;guarded ; all were permitted to ſpeak with him who&nbsp;pleaſed ; arid it was thought very remarkable that a Jeſuit ſhould ſay to him, &quot; Friend, take care, whatever&nbsp;you do, that you don’t charge honeſt people.” He&nbsp;was removed next day from the houſe of Efpernûn to&nbsp;the Conciergerie, the proper priſon of the parliament&nbsp;of. Paris. ΛVhen he was firſt interrogated, he anſwered with great boldneſs, &quot; That he had done it,&nbsp;and would do it, if it were to do again.” when&nbsp;he was told that the king, though dangerouſly wounded, was living, and might recover, he ſaid that he had&nbsp;ſtruck him home, and that he was ſure he was dead.&nbsp;In his ſubſequent examinations he owned that he had&nbsp;long had an intention to kill the king, becauſe he ſuf-fered two religions in his kingdom ; and that he endeavoured to obtain an audience of him, that he might&nbsp;admoniſh him. He alſo ſaid that he underſtood the king’s&nbsp;great armament to be againſt the pope, and that, in his&nbsp;opinion, to make war againſt the pope, was to make&nbsp;war againſt God. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">WC </span><span class="font1">have no diſtinct account of the&nbsp;three laſt examinations ; but he is ſaid to have perfiſted,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">in the moſt ſolemn aſſeverations, that he had no accomplices, and that nobody had perſuaded him to the fact. He appeared ſurpriſed at nothing ſo much as at the&nbsp;univerſal abhorrence of the people, which, it ſeems,&nbsp;he did not expect. They were forced to guard him&nbsp;ſtrictly from his fellow-priſoners, who would otherwiſe&nbsp;have murdered him. The butchers of Paris deſired to&nbsp;have him put into their hands, affirming that they would&nbsp;flay him alive, and that he ſhould ſtill live 12 days,&nbsp;when he was put to the torture, he broke out into&nbsp;horrid execrations, and always inſiſted that he did the&nbsp;fact from his own motive, and that he could accuſe&nbsp;nobody. Οη the day of his execution, after he had&nbsp;made the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">amende honourable</span><span class="font1"> before the church of Notre&nbsp;Dame, he was carried to the Greve; and, being brought&nbsp;upon a ſcaffold, was tied to a wooden engine in the&nbsp;ſhape of a St Andrew’s crofs. The knife with which&nbsp;he did the murder being faſtened in his right hand, it&nbsp;was firſt burnt in a flow fire ; then the ſſeſhy parts&nbsp;of his body were torn with red-hot pincers, and melted&nbsp;lead, oil, pitch, and roſin, poured into the wounds,</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">and through </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font1">clay funnel into his bowels by </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">the navel. </span><span class="font1">The people refuſed to pray for hirn ; and when, according to the ſentence pronounced upon him, he came&nbsp;to be dragged to pieces by four horfes, one of thoſe&nbsp;that were brought appearing to be but weak, one of&nbsp;the ſpectators offered his own, with which the criminal&nbsp;was much moved : he is ſaid to have then made a con-feſſion, which was ſo written by thc greffier Voifιn,&nbsp;that not ſo much as one word of it could ever be read.&nbsp;He was very earneſt for abſolution, which his confeſſor&nbsp;refufed, unleſs he would reveal his accomplices ; &quot; Give&nbsp;it me conditionally (ſaid he) ; upon condition that </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">have told the truth,” which they did. His body was&nbsp;ſo robuſt, that it reſiſted the force of the horſes ; and&nbsp;the executioner was at length obliged to cut him into&nbsp;quarters, which the people dragged through the ſtreets.&nbsp;The houſe in which he was born was demoliſhed, and&nbsp;a column of infamy erected ; his father and mother&nbsp;were baniſhed from Angouleſme, and ordered to quit&nbsp;the kingdom upon pain 6f being hanged, if they returned, without any form of proceſs ; his brothers, ſiſters,&nbsp;uncles, and other relations, were commanded to lay&nbsp;aſide the name of Ravilliac, and to affume ſome other.&nbsp;Such was the fate of this execrable monſter, who, ac-cording to his own account, ſuſſered himſelf to be im-pelled to ſuch a fact by the ſeditious fermons and books&nbsp;of the Jefuits, whom Henry, rather out of fear than&nbsp;love, had recalled and careſſed, and to whom he had&nbsp;bequeathed his heart.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Neither the dying words of Ravilliac, nor ſo much of his proceſs as was publiſhed, were credited by his&nbsp;cotemporaries. Regalt the hiſtorian ſays, that there&nbsp;were two different opinions concerning this aſſaffina-tion ; one, that it was conducted by ſome grandees, who&nbsp;ſacrificed that monarch to their old reſentments; the&nbsp;other, that it was done by the emiſſaries of the Spaniards. Letters from Bruſſels, Antwerp, Mechlin, and&nbsp;other places, were received before the 15th of May,&nbsp;with a report of the king’s death. Though nothing&nbsp;occurs in the examinations of Ravilliac that were firſt&nbsp;publiſhed, in reference to hi3 journeys to Naples and&nbsp;other places; yet as theſe are ſet down as certain truths&nbsp;by good authors, ſo there are probable grounds to believe that they were not fictitious. It appears from&nbsp;Sir Ralph win wood’s Memorials, that Ravilliac had&nbsp;been not long before at Bruſſels. Amongſt other cir-cumſtances that created a very great doubt, whether&nbsp;the aſſaſſin ſpoke truth, were the things found in his&nbsp;pocket at the time he was feized ; amongſt which was&nbsp;a chaplet, the figure of a heart made in cotton, in the&nbsp;centre of which he ſaid there was a bit of the true&nbsp;croſs, but when cut there was none, which he affirmed&nbsp;was given him by a canon at Angouleſme, a piece o£&nbsp;paper with the arms of France painted upon it, ano-ther full of characters, and a third containing verſes for&nbsp;the meditation of a criminal going to execution. The&nbsp;provoſt of Pluviers, or Petiviers, in Beauce, about </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">fix&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">miles from Paris, had ſaid openly on the day that Henry IV. was murdered, &quot; This day the king is either&nbsp;ſlain or dangerouſly wounded.” After the king’s death&nbsp;w<sup>r</sup>as known, he was ſeized and ſent priſoner to Paris ; ‘&nbsp;but, before he was examined, he was found hanged in&nbsp;the firings of his drawers. His body was, notwith-ſtanding, hung up by the heels on the common gibbet&nbsp;on the 19th of June, what increaſed the ſuſpicions</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
