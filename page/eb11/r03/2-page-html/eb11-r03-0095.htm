<p><span class="font0">the fresh-water discharge, generally forms the navigable channel, which is scoured out during floods. Narrowing the river between&nbsp;the'bends to bring the two channels together would unduly restrict&nbsp;the tidal flow; and in a river like the Hugli dependent on the tidal&nbsp;influx for the maintenance of its depth for two-thirds of the year,&nbsp;and with channels changing with the wet and dry seasons, so that&nbsp;deepening by dredging in the turbid river could not be permanent,&nbsp;training works below low water to bring the ebb-tide current&nbsp;into the flood-tide channel, which latter must not be obstructed&nbsp;at all, offer, aided by dredging, the best prospects of improvement.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The average rate of enlargement adopted for.the trained channel ol the Nervion, in proportion to its length, is I in 75 between Bilbao&nbsp;and its mouth, and I in 71 for the Weser from Bremen to Bremerhaven; and these ratios correspond very nearly to the enlargement&nbsp;cf the regulated channel of the Clyde from Glasgow to Dumbarton&nbsp;of I in 83, and of the Tyne from Newcastle to its mouth of 1 in 75.&nbsp;Accordingly, a rate of enlargement comprised between I in 70 and&nbsp;I in 80 for the regulated or trained channel of the lower portion of&nbsp;a tidal river with a fairly level bed may be expected to give satisfactory results.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Works at the Outlet of Tidal Rivers.—</span><span class="font0">Tidal rivers flowing straight into the sea, without expanding into an estuary, are subject to the&nbsp;obstruction of a bar formed by the heaping-up action ol the waves&nbsp;and drift along the coast, especially when the fresh-water discharge&nbsp;is small; and the scour of the currents is generally concentrated&nbsp;and extended across the beach by parallel jetties for lowering the&nbsp;bar, as at the outlets of the Maas (figs. 11 ana 12) and of the Ncrvdon&nbsp;(figs. 19 and 20). In the latter case, however, the trained outlet&nbsp;was still liable to be obstructed by drift during north-westerly&nbsp;storms in the Bay of Biscay; and, except in the case of large rivers,&nbsp;the jetties have to be placed too close together, if the scour is to be&nbsp;adequate, to form an easily accessible entrance on an exposed&nbsp;coast. Accordingly, a harbour has been formed in the small bay&nbsp;into which the Nervion flows by two converging breakwaters,&nbsp;which provides a sheltered approach to the river and protects the&nbsp;outlet from drift (fig. 19), and a similar provision has been made&nbsp;at Sunderland for the mouth of the Wear; whilst the Tynemouth&nbsp;piers formed part of the original design for the improvement of the&nbsp;Tyne, under shelter of which the bar has been removed by dredging&nbsp;(hg* 17)·</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Training Works through Sandy Estuaries.—</span><span class="font0">Manytidalriversflow through bays, estuaries or arms of the sea before reaching the&nbsp;open sea, as, for instance, the Mersey through Liverpool Bay,&nbsp;the Tees through its enclosed bay, the Liffey through Dublin&nbsp;Bay, the Thames, the Ribble, the Dee, the Shannon, the&nbsp;Seine, the Scheldt, the Weser and the Elbe through their respective estuaries, the Yorkshire Ouse and Trent through the&nbsp;Humber estuary, the Garonne and Dordogne through the Gironde&nbsp;estuary, and the Clyde, the Tay, the Severn and the St Lawrence&nbsp;through friths or arms of the sea. These estuaries vary greatly in&nbsp;their tidal range, the distance inland of the ports to which they give&nbsp;access, and the facilities they offer for navigation. Some possess a&nbsp;very ample depth in their outer portion, though they generally&nbsp;become shallow towards their upper end; but dredging often suffices&nbsp;to remedy their deficiencies and to extend their deep-water channel.&nbsp;Thus the St Lawrence, which possesses an ample depth from the&nbsp;Atlantic up to Quebec, has been rendered accessible for seagoing vessels up to Montreal by a moderate amount of dredging;&nbsp;whilst dredging has been resorted to in parts of the Thames and&nbsp;Humber estuaries, and on the Elbe a little below Hamburg, to provide for the increasing draught of vessels; and the Mersey bar&nbsp;in Liverpool Bay, about 11 m. seawards of the actual mouth of the&nbsp;river, has been lowered by suction dredging from a depth of about&nbsp;9 ft. down to about 27 ft. below low water of equinoctial spring&nbsp;tides, to admit Atlantic liners at any state of the tide.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Some estuaries, however, are so encumbered by sand banks that their rivers can only form shallow, shifting channels through&nbsp;them to the sea; and these channels require to be guided or fixed&nbsp;by longitudinal training walls, consisting of mounds of rubble&nbsp;stone, chalk, slag or fascines, in order to form sufficiently deep stable&nbsp;channels to be available for navigation. The difficulty in such&nbsp;works is to fix the wandering channel adequately, and to deepen it</span></p>
