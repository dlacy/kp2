<p><span class="font0">shutter of the navigable pass at Port-à-Γ Anglais is 3∣ feet wide, and rises 12⅜ feet above the sill of the weir. Smaller shutter&nbsp;weirs, of a similar form, are placed on the top of overfalls to&nbsp;regulate the discharge, being so adjusted that the shutters dip&nbsp;when the water attains a certain height above them. Sometimes&nbsp;the regulation of the flow is effected through the large shutters by&nbsp;means of small shutters fixed in their upper panels, called butterfly&nbsp;valves, which open spontaneously when the water rises above the&nbsp;required height. The smaller shutters on the overfalls are entirely&nbsp;lowered in flood-time, like the large shutters, but, being unprovided with a foot-bridge, they are raised by aid of boats on the&nbsp;approach of the dry season. The earlier shutters erected across the&nbsp;navigable passes were similarly raised ; but, though a foot bridge&nbsp;adds considerably to the cost of a shutter weir, it greatly facilitates&nbsp;its working.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The navigable passes in French rivers, which are always closed either by frame or shutter weirs, serve for the passage of vessels&nbsp;during floods when the locks are submerged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With the exception of the primitive movable stanches, there is only one example of a movable weir in England. This self-acting&nbsp;shutter weir has been erected across the Irwell at Thostlenest near&nbsp;Manchester ; and a section of it is given in fig. 6. The weir&nbsp;consists of a series of shutters turning on a central horizontal axis.&nbsp;When the weir is closed, each shutter is inclined at an angle of&nbsp;35° to the vertical, as shown in fig. 6, and revolves to a horizontal&nbsp;position for opening the weir. It resembles in fact the French&nbsp;shutter weirs, except that the shutters and their supports are not&nbsp;removed from the channel, so that the waterway at Thostlenest is&nbsp;not so unimpeded as in the French system. The shutters are so&nbsp;adjusted that they open when the river rises 2 j feet above its ordinary level ; but, lest the rush of water, which would result from&nbsp;their sudden opening, should injure the river bed, an arrangement&nbsp;has been made for opening any of the shutters by means of a set of&nbsp;chains w<sup>τ</sup>orked by crabs from each bank, so as to release the pent-up&nbsp;waters more gradually.@@<sup>1</sup> This weir, designed by Mr Wiswall,&nbsp;consists of fourteen shutters, each 10 feet wide above the axis and&nbsp;9 feet below, and 12 feet long. The actual height of the weir&nbsp;above the floor is only 10 feet, owing to the inclination of the&nbsp;shutters, so that it presents a surface of 1400 square feet to the&nbsp;stream when closed, which is reduced to 293 feet when open.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The drum weir, which has been adopted in several instances on the river Marne, consists of an upper and an under iron paddle&nbsp;capable of making a quarter of a revolution round a horizontal&nbsp;central axis. The upper paddle forms the weir, and the under one&nbsp;revolves in a closed recess, shaped like the quadrant of a cylinder,&nbsp;laid below the sill of the weir, from which the term drum is&nbsp;derived (fig. 7). The under paddle and the drum are so formed&nbsp;that a space is left between the upper face of the paddle and the top&nbsp;of the drum when the paddles are horizontal ; and a similar space&nbsp;exists between the down-stream face of the paddle and the vertical&nbsp;wall of the drum when the paddles are vertical, as represented in&nbsp;fig. 7. These spaces serve as sluiceways by which water can be&nbsp;admitted into the series of drums on the upper or under side of the&nbsp;under paddles. The weir is closed by placing the upper sluiceway&nbsp;in communication with the upper pool, when the pressure of water&nbsp;on the upper faces of the under paddles overcomes the pressure of&nbsp;the stream upon the upper paddles, causing them to rise, and&nbsp;closing the weir against the stream. The weir is readily opened&nbsp;by shutting off communication between the upper pool and the&nbsp;upper sluiceway, and opening communication with the lower pool ;&nbsp;the stream then depresses the upper paddles, or the action can be&nbsp;quickened by opening communication between the upper pool and&nbsp;lower sluiceway. The pressure on either side of the under paddles&nbsp;can be easily adjusted with the utmost precision, enabling the&nbsp;paddles to be placed at any angle, so that the most absolute&nbsp;control is obtained over the discharge at the weir. The largest&nbsp;example of this type of weir is at Joinville, on the Marne, only a few&nbsp;miles above Paris. The weir is formed by forty-two paddles, 3⅜&nbsp;feet high and 4⅔ feet wide, which are worked with great ease by&nbsp;means of sluice gates on the left bank, being opened or closed in&nbsp;three or four minutes by one man. This type of weir has the&nbsp;defect of not being suited for navigable passes, owing to the depth&nbsp;of the foundations for the drum below the floor of the weir having&nbsp;to exceed the height of the actual weir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Movable weirs possess the great merit over other forms of weirs of offering little or no impediment to the passage of floods ; and this&nbsp;advantage is still further enhanced by the system of warnings,&nbsp;organized for the Seine, the Loire, and other French rivers, whereby&nbsp;timely information of the approach of a flood is telegraphed to the&nbsp;various weir keepers, so that they may fully open the weirs before&nbsp;its arrival, and thus aid in facilitating its descent. By telegraphic&nbsp;intimation of the rise in the upper tributaries, and of the rainfall&nbsp;in the basin, it is possible to predict with remarkable accuracy the&nbsp;probable rise of the river at places lower down, and to afford valuable warning of a coming flood to the riparian proprietors.</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Tidal and Tideless Rivers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rivers may be broadly divided into two classes in respect of the lower portion of their course, for the tide is&nbsp;propagated up some rivers to a considerable distance from&nbsp;their mouth, commingling with the fresh water and producing an ebb and flow far into the interior ; whilst rivers&nbsp;flowing into tideless seas descend with an unimpeded&nbsp;current to their outlet. Tidal and tideless rivers, possessing very distinct physical characteristics, necessarily present different features and require different methods of&nbsp;improvement, and will be therefore separately considered.&nbsp;Tidal rivers are the more numerous, owing to the greater&nbsp;extent of tidal seas. The great differences also in the&nbsp;tidal rise introduce numerous variations in the tidal influence on rivers, and the rise of the river bed determines&nbsp;the distance to which the tidal flow extends. Accordingly, tidal rivers exhibit a greater diversity in their&nbsp;natural condition than tideless rivers, which are only&nbsp;affected by the volume of their fresh-water discharge, the&nbsp;amount of sediment carried in suspension, and the inclination of their bed. These latter conditions affect also the&nbsp;state of tidal rivers, but their influence is greatly modified&nbsp;by the ebb and flow of a large volume of tidal waters.&nbsp;The effect of the tidal ebb and flow is most readily perceived in contrasting the mouths of tidal and tideless&nbsp;rivers. The mouths of the Mississippi, the Nile, the&nbsp;Danube, and the Rhone present very marked differences&nbsp;to the outlets of the St Lawrence, the Seine, the Thames,&nbsp;and the Severn. Tideless rivers divide into a number of&nbsp;mouths, whereas tidal rivers are confined to a single outlet ; and the effect of tidal influence on this difference is&nbsp;still further confirmed by the instance of the Maas, which,&nbsp;with a very slight tidal range, exhibits a tendency to&nbsp;deteriorate into the dispersion of mouths of a tideless&nbsp;river. The value of tidal flow in maintaining a river is&nbsp;fully manifested by comparing the navigable condition of&nbsp;the Thames or of the muddy Humber with the delta of&nbsp;the Nile or the Rhone, though the latter rivers possess a&nbsp;much larger fresh-w<sup>r</sup>ater discharge. The tidal rise also&nbsp;frequently allows of the access of vessels to a river whose&nbsp;entrance is barred at low water.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The general improvements of the upper portions of both tidal and tideless rivers may be carried out on&nbsp;similar principles, though on approaching their mouths&nbsp;they need a totally different treatment. To give a river a&nbsp;uniform depth, its channel and flow require regulation.&nbsp;Hard shoals may be permanently removed by dredging; but&nbsp;silty shoals, even when dredged away, will re-form unless&nbsp;the channel is contracted. Formerly rivers were regulated&nbsp;by building out jetties at intervals at right angles to the&nbsp;banks, especially in wide shoal places, in order to contract&nbsp;the channel and concentrate the stream, so as to scour&nbsp;a deeper central channel. These cross jetties, however,&nbsp;whilst effecting a deepening in front of their extremities,&nbsp;caused irregularities in the flow of the current in the&nbsp;intervals between them, thus producing differences in&nbsp;depth. Continuous longitudinal jetties, or training banks,&nbsp;though more costly, are much more efficient in regulating&nbsp;a river, and are now generally adopted for procuring a&nbsp;uniform width, and, consequently, a regular depth. Where&nbsp;the fall alters, a corresponding variation must be made in&nbsp;the section of the channel ; and, in the case of tidal rivers,&nbsp;the section should gradually increase as it approaches the&nbsp;sea, so as to admit the increasing volume of sea water&nbsp;which enters but does not pass far up the estuary whose&nbsp;upper portion has been filled by the earlier flow.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Most rivers, whether tidal or tideless, are more or less impeded for navigation by a bar at their mouth. A bar&nbsp;is a ridge or shoal extending across the navigable channel,</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
