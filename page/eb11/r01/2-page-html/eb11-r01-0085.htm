<p><span class="font1">There were two high-pressure cylinders placed outside the frames and driving on a trailing wheel, and one low-pressure&nbsp;cylinder placed between the frames and driving on a wheel&nbsp;placed in front of the driving-wheel belonging to the high-pressure cylinders. The steam connexions were such that the&nbsp;two high-pressure cylinders were placed in parallel, both cx-hausting into the one low-pressure cylinder. The first engines&nbsp;of this class were provided with high-pressure cylinders, 11 in.&nbsp;diameter and 24 in. stroke, a low-pressure cylinder 26 in.&nbsp;diameter, 24 in. stroke, and driving-wheels 6 ft. 6 in. diameter;&nbsp;but subsequently these dimensions were varied. There were&nbsp;no coupling rods. A complete account of Webb’s engines&nbsp;will be found in a paper, “ The Compound Principle applied&nbsp;to Locomotives, ” by E. Worthington, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Proc. Inst. C. E.,</span><span class="font1"> 1889,&nbsp;vol. xcvi. Locomotives have to start with the full load on&nbsp;the engine, consequently an outstanding feature of every&nbsp;compound locomotive is the apparatus or mechanism added&nbsp;to enable the engine to start readily. Generally steam from&nbsp;the boiler is admitted direct to the low-pressure cylinder&nbsp;through a reducing valve, and valves and devices are used&nbsp;to prevent the steam so admitted acting as a back pressure&nbsp;on the high-pressure cylinder. In the Webb compound the&nbsp;driver opened communication from the high-pressure exhaust&nbsp;pipe to the blast-pipe, and at the same time opened a valve&nbsp;giving a supply of steam from the boiler direct to the low-pressure valve chest. T. W. Worsdell developed the design&nbsp;of the two-cylinder compound in England and built several,&nbsp;first for the Great Eastern railway and subsequently for the&nbsp;North-Eastern railway. The engines were built on the Worsdell&nbsp;and Von Borrics plan, and were fitted with an ingenious starting-valve of an automatic character to overcome the difficulties&nbsp;of starting. Several compounds of a type introduced by&nbsp;W. M. Smith on the North-Eastern railway in 1898 have been&nbsp;built by the Midland railway. In these there are two low-pressure cylinders placed outside the frame, and one high-pressure cylinder placed between the frames. All cylinders&nbsp;drive on one crank-axle with three cranks at 120°. The driving-wheels are coupled to a pair of trailing wheels. A controlling&nbsp;valve enables the supply of steam to the low-pressure cylinders&nbsp;to be supplemented by boiler steam at a reduced pressure.&nbsp;For a description and illustrations of the details of the starting&nbsp;devices used in the Webb, Worsdell and Smith compounds,&nbsp;sec an article, “ The Development of the Compound Locomotive&nbsp;in England, ” by W. E. Dalby in the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Engineering Magazine&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">for September and October 1904. A famous type of compound locomotive developed on the continent of Europe is&nbsp;the four-cylinder De Glehn, some of which have been tried&nbsp;on the Great Western railway. There are two high-pressure&nbsp;cylinders placed outside the frame, and two low-pressure&nbsp;placed inside the frames. The low-pressure cylinders drive&nbsp;on the leading crank-axle with cranks at right angles, the high-pressure cylinders driving on the trailing wheels. The wheels&nbsp;are coupled, but the feature of the engine is that the coupling-rods act merely to keep the high-pressure and low-pressure&nbsp;engines in phase with one another, very little demand being&nbsp;made upon them to transmit force except when one of the&nbsp;wheels begins to slip. In this arrangement the whole of&nbsp;the adhesive weight of the engine is used in the best possible&nbsp;manner, and the driving of the train is practically equally&nbsp;divided between two axles. The engine can be worked as&nbsp;a four-cylinder simple at the will of the driver. S. M.&nbsp;Vauclain introduced a successful type of four-cylinder compound in America in 1889. A high- and low-pressure&nbsp;cylinder are cast together, and the piston-rods belonging to&nbsp;them are both coupled to one cross-head which is connected&nbsp;to the driving-wheels, these again being coupled to other&nbsp;wheels in the usual way. The distribution of steam to both&nbsp;cylinders is effected by one piston-valve operated by a link&nbsp;motion, so that there is considerable mechanical simplicity in&nbsp;the arrangement. Later Vauclain introduced the “ balanced&nbsp;compound. ” In this engine the two piston-rods of one side are&nbsp;not coupled to a common cross-head, but drive on separate&nbsp;cranks at an angle of 180°, the pair of 180° cranks on each side&nbsp;being placed at right angles.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">§18. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Balancing of Locomotives. —</span><span class="font1">The unbalanced masses of a locomotive may be divided into two parts, namely, masses&nbsp;which revolve, as the crank-pins, the crank-cheeks, the coupling-rods, &amp;c.; and masses which reciprocate, made up of the piston,&nbsp;piston-rod, cross-head and a certain proportion of the connecting-rod. The revolving masses are truly balanced by&nbsp;balance weights placed between the spokes of the wheels, or&nbsp;sometimes by prolonging the crank-webs and forming the prolongation into balance weights. It is also the custom to balance&nbsp;a proportion of the reciprocating masses by balance weights&nbsp;placed between the spokes of the wheels, and the actual balance&nbsp;weight seen in a driving-wheel is the resultant of the separate&nbsp;weights required for the balancing of the revolving parts and&nbsp;the reciprocating parts. The component of a balance weight&nbsp;which is necessary to balance the reciprocating masses introduces a vertical unbalanced force which appears as a variation&nbsp;of pressure between the wheel and the rail, technically called&nbsp;the hammer-blow, the magnitude of which increases as the&nbsp;square of the speed of the train. In consequence of this action&nbsp;the compromise is usually followed of balancing only ⅔ of the&nbsp;reciprocating masses, thus keeping the hammer-blow within&nbsp;proper limits, and allowing ⅓ of the reciprocating masses to be&nbsp;unbalanced in the horizontal direction. It is not possible to&nbsp;do anything better with two-cylinder locomotives unless bob-weights be added, but with four-cylinder four-crank engines&nbsp;complete balance is possible both in the vertical and in the&nbsp;horizontal directions. When the four cranks are placed with&nbsp;two pairs at 180°, the pairs being at 90°, the forces are balanced&nbsp;without the introduction of a hammer-blow, but there remain&nbsp;large unbalanced couples, which if balanced by means of revolving weights in the wheels again reintroduce the hammer-blow, and if left unbalanced tend to make the engine oscillate&nbsp;in a horizontal plane at high speed. The principles by means&nbsp;of which the magnitude and position of balance weights are worked out are given in the article Mechanics (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Applied&nbsp;Mechanics),</span><span class="font1"> and the whole subject of locomotive balancing&nbsp;is exhaustively treated with numerous numerical examples&nbsp;in </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">The Balancing of Engines</span><span class="font1"> by W. E. Dalby, London, 1906.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">§19. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Classification. —</span><span class="font1">Locomotives may be classified primarily into “ tender engines ’’ and “ tank engines, ’’ the water and&nbsp;fuel in the latter being carried on the engine proper, while&nbsp;in the former they are carried in a separate vehicle. A tender&nbsp;is generally mounted on six wheels, or in some cases on two&nbsp;bogies, and carries a larger supply of water and fuel than can&nbsp;be carried by tanks and the bunker of a tank engine. A tender,&nbsp;however, is so much dead-weight to be hauled, whilst the weight&nbsp;of the water and fuel in a tank engine contributes largely&nbsp;to the production of adhesion. A classification may also be&nbsp;made, according to the work for which engines are designed,&nbsp;into passenger engines, goods engines, and shunting or switching&nbsp;engines. A convenient way of describing any type of engine&nbsp;is by means of numerals indicating the number of wheels—&nbsp;(1) in the group of wheels supporting the leading or chimney&nbsp;end, (2) in the group of coupled wheels, and (3) in the group&nbsp;supporting the trailing end of the engine. In the case where&nbsp;cither the leading or trailing group of small wheels is absent&nbsp;the numeral 0 must be used in the scries of three numbers used&nbsp;in the description. Thus 4-4-2 represents a bogie engine with&nbsp;four-coupled wheels and one pair of trailing wheels, the well-known Atlantic type; 4-2-2 represents a bogie engine with a&nbsp;single pair of driving-wheels and a pair of trailing wheels;&nbsp;0-4-4 represents an engine with four-coupled wheels and a&nbsp;trailing bogie, and 4-4-0 an engine with four-coupled wheels&nbsp;and a leading bogie. A general description of the chief&nbsp;peculiarities of various kinds of locomotives is given in the&nbsp;following analysis of types: —</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) “ Single-driver&quot; type, 4-2-2 or 2-2-2. Still used by several railways in Great Britain for express passenger service, but going&nbsp;out of favour; it is also found in France, and less often in Germany,&nbsp;Italy, and elsewhere in Europe. It is generally designed as a 4-2-2&nbsp;engine, but some old types are still running with only three axles,</span></p>
