<p><span class="font2">dam or weir, and even when this is immersed in water on both sides, as in a bar or keep, frequently employed for&nbsp;raising the waters of the level streams in Flanders in order&nbsp;to render them navigable. We mentioned an observation@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>of Du Buat to this effect, when he saw a gooseberry rise up&nbsp;from the bottom of the canal along the face of the bar, and&nbsp;then rapidly fly over its top. We have attempted to represent this motion of the filaments in these different situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Fig. 5.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">A shows the motion through a thin plate.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">B shows the motion when a tube of about two diameters long is added, and when the water flows with a full mouth.&nbsp;This does not always happen in so short a pipe (and never&nbsp;in one that is shorter), but the water frequently detaches&nbsp;itself from the sides of the pipe, and flows with a contracted jet</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">C shows the motion when the pipe projects into the inside of the vessel. In this case it is difficult to makc it flow full.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">D represents a mouth-piece fitted to the hole, and formed agreeably to that shape which a jet would assume of itself. In this case all contraction is avoided, because the mouth of this pipe may be considered as the real orifice,&nbsp;and nothing now diminishes the discharge but a trifling&nbsp;friction of the sides.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">E shows the motion of water over a dam or weir, where the fall is free or unobstructed ; the surface of the lower&nbsp;stream being lower than the edge or sole of the waste-board.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">F is a similar representation of the motion of water over what we would call a </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bar</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">keep.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It was one great aim of the experiments of Michelotti and Bossut to determine the effects of contraction in these&nbsp;cases. Michelotti, after carefully observing the form and&nbsp;dimensions of the natural jet, made various mouth-pieces&nbsp;resembling it, till he obtained one which produced the&nbsp;smallest diminution of the computed discharge, or till the&nbsp;discharge computed for the area of its smaller end approached the nearest to the effective discharge. And he at last&nbsp;obtained one which gave a discharge of 983, when the natural discharge would have been 1000. This piece was&nbsp;formed by the revolution of a trochoid round the axis of&nbsp;the jet, and the dimensions were as follow ;</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Diameter of the outer orifice = 36 Diameter of the inner orifice = 46&nbsp;Length of the axis&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;= 96</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The results of the experiments of the Abbé Bossut and of Michelotti scarcely differ, and they are expressed in the&nbsp;following table :</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">The numbers in the last column of this little table are the cubical inches of water discharged in a second when&nbsp;the height </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font2"> is one inch.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It must be observed, that the discharges assigned here for the weir and bar relate only to the contractions occasioned by the passage over the edge of the board. The&nbsp;weir may also suffer a diminution by the contractions at its&nbsp;two ends, if it should be narrower than the stream, which&nbsp;is generally the case, because the two ends are commonly&nbsp;of square masonry or wood-work. The contraction there&nbsp;is nearly the same with that at the edge of a thin plate.&nbsp;But this could not be introduced into this table, because its&nbsp;effect on the expense is the same in quantity whatever is&nbsp;the length of the waste-board of the weir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">In like manner, the diminution of discharge through a sluice could not be expressed here. When a sluice is&nbsp;drawn up, but its lower edge still remains under water, the<sup>&nbsp;</sup>discharge is contracted both above and at the sides, and the diminution of discharge by each is in proportion to its&nbsp;extent. It is not easy to reduce either of these contractions&nbsp;to computation, but they may be very easily observed.&nbsp;We frequently can observe the water, at coming out of a&nbsp;sluice into a mill-course, quit the edge of the aperture, and&nbsp;show a part of the bottom quite dry. This is always the&nbsp;case when the velocity of efflux is considerable. When it&nbsp;is very moderate, this place is occupied by an eddy water&nbsp;almost stagnant. When the head of water is eight or ten&nbsp;inches, and runs off freely, the space left between it and&nbsp;the sides is about one and a half inch. If the sides of the&nbsp;entry have a slope, this void space can never appear ; but&nbsp;there is always this tendency to convergence, which diminishes the quantity of the discharge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It will frequently abridge computation very much to consider the water discharged in these different situations as moving with a common velocity, which we conceive as produced not by a fall from the surface of the fluid (which is&nbsp;exact only when the expense is equal to the natural expense), but by a fall </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h</span><span class="font2"> accommodated to the discharge : or&nbsp;it is convenient to know the height which would produce&nbsp;that very velocity which the water issues with in these situations.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">And also, when the water is observed to be actually moving with a velocity V, and we know whether it is coming through a thin plate, through a tube, over a dam, &amp;c.&nbsp;it is necessary to know' the pressure or head of water </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">h&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">which has actually produced this velocity. It is convenient&nbsp;therefore to have the following numbers in readiness.</span></p>
