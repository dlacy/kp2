The best evidence of a dense population in those days is that afforded by the specific estimates of ancient writers for some of the larger cities. The population of Tarraco (Tarragona) was estimated at 2<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> millions, and that of Nova Carthago (Cartagena), Italica (Sevilla la Vieja), and others at several hundreds of thousands. Emerita Augusta (Merida) had a Roman garrison of 90,000 men, which also implies a large population.@@<hi rend="superscript">1</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Table II.—Area and Population of the Former

included in the kingdom were for one reason or another not embraced in the enumeration, so that the total population assigned to Spain within its present limits for that date is obtained by adding the results of enumerations at different dates in the provinces then excluded. The total thus arrived at is 8,206,791. No other census took place till 1787, when the total was found to be 10,268,150 ; and this census was followed by another in 1797, when the population was returned as 10,541,221. Various estimates were made within the next sixty years, but the census of 1857 proved that some of these estimates must have been greatly below the truth. The total population then ascertained to exist in Spain was 15,464,340, an increase of not much less than 50 per cent. since the census of 1797. The last census took place on December 31, 1877, and the total population then ascertained, 16,631,869, shows an increase of only 7<hi rend="superscript">1</hi>/<hi rend="subscript">2</hi> per cent., equal to an annual increase at the rate of 0·35 per cent.—lower than in any other country in Europe except France.</p><p>As Table II. shows, the density of population in Spain as a whole is little more than that of the most thinly peopled county of England in 1881 (Westmoreland, 82 to the square mile). Looking at the old provinces, we find that the most thickly peopled are all maritime, and that all the maritime provinces except Andalusia and Murcia have a density exceeding 100 to the square mile. The most densely peopled province of all is not Catalonia, in which manufacturing industries are so highly developed, nor the Basque Provinces with their great iron industry, but Galicia, where there are neither manufactures nor minerals to speak of, but where tillage occupies a relatively larger area than anywhere else in Spain. Of the modern provinces the most thinly peopled are Cuenca and Ciudad Real, in the barren region of the east and south of New Castile, and Albacete in the Murcian steppe, in each case the density being less than half of that of the most thinly peopled English county. The column indicating the increase (or decrease) per cent. of the population between 1857 and 1877 shows that, outside of the province in which the capital is situated, the increase points chiefly to the recent development of manufactures and mining,—to the development of copper mines in Huelva, lead mines in Jaen, iron mines in Vizcaya, cotton manufactures in Barcelona. In Murcia it points no doubt to the great development of the trade in esparto as well as in southern fruits. On the other hand the decrease in Lerida and Gerona indicates how the attraction of higher wages in the manufacturing districts of Catalonia tends to deplete the neighbouring country districts.</p><p>As regards the distribution of population between town and country, Spain contrasts in a marked manner with Italy, Spain having but few large towns and a relatively large country population. In 1877 there were only five towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants:—Madrid (397,816), Barcelona (248,943), Valencia (143,861), Seville (134,318), and Malaga (115,882). Only nine had a population between 50,000 and 100,000, and besides these only 171 had a population above 10,000.</p><p>The birth-rate in Spain is 33·9 per thousand as against 35·1 in England and Wales, the death-rate 29·1 (21·4 in England and Wales); the number of marriages per thousand inhabitants was 7·32@@<hi rend="superscript">2</hi> (8·08 in England and Wales). The percentage of illegitimacy is 5·6. The number of males born for every 100 females averages 107, a higher proportion than in any other country of Europe for which statistics are obtainable except Greece (112) and Roumania (111).</p><p><hi rend="italic">Foreign Possessions.—</hi>The population of the principal foreign possessions of Spain in 1877 numbered 7,822,123, made up as follows :—</p><p>Cuba	1,521,684 ∣  Philippine Islands 5,567,685</p><p>Porto Rico	731,648 ∣ Fernando Po	1,106</p><p>Besides the Philippine Islands in the Eastern Archipelago, Spain possesses the greater part of the Sulu Archipelago, and, in the Pacific, the Marianne, Pelew, and Caroline Islands. Off the Guinea coast she possesses the Island of Annobon as well as that of Fernando Po, and on the coast itself the district round Corisco Bay. She has likewise declared a protectorate over the West African coast between Capes Bojador and Blanco (desert of Sahara). The presidios, whose population is given in Table II., are Peñon de Velez, Alhucemas, and Melila (besides Ceuta).</p><p><hi rend="italic">Agriculture.—</hi>Agriculture is by far the most important Spanish industry, nearly 73 per cent. of those whose occupations were classified at the census of 1877 being entered under that head. In general it is in a backward condition, and is now much less productive than in the time of the Romans and again under the Moors. The expulsion of the latter people in many places inflicted upon agriculture a blow from which it has not recovered to this day.
