The invention of a durable, economical, and safe apparatus still remains to be made. In the infancy of steam-navigation, Mr Buchanan of Glasgow published an account and drawing of a reefing paddle ; Messrs Bolton and Watt are also in possession of a very old method of reefing paddles ; the Society of Arts in Scotland offered a prize several years ago for the invention, without obtaining, out of many plans, one to be recommended for practice ; and, finally, the indefatigable inventor, Mr Hall of Basford, has patented a very elegant mechanism for the same purpose. It still, however, remains to introduce and establish a perfect reefing apparatus, and the author of such a system will render the common paddle-wheel a perfect propeller.</p><p><hi rend="italic">The following Table exhibits a comparative view of the Size and Power of six of the largest of the recently constructed Vessels for Transatlantic navigation.</hi></p><table><row><cell/><cell cols="6">NAME OF VESSELS.</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>British Queen</cell><cell>President</cell><cell>New York.</cell><cell>Great Western.</cell><cell>Liverpool.</cell><cell>Acadia.*</cell></row><row><cell/><cell>Ft.

These figures exhibit a front and side elevation of one of the simplest forms of the non-condensing steam-engine. Its principal parts are the cylinder A, the piston-rod P <hi rend="italic">p, </hi>and connecting rod <hi rend="italic">p</hi> K, acting directly upon the crank K X, and fly-wheel W W. Besides these there are only an eccentric and valve-rod <hi rend="italic">xx x,</hi> and governor <hi rend="italic">w w. </hi>Two columns and an entablature support one extremity of the crank axle, and give attachment to minor appendages. The other extremity of the axle rests on the wall of the building. To the columns is attached <hi rend="italic">g g, </hi>a guide for the top of the piston-rod. The feed-pump <hi rend="italic">fff,</hi> is worked by an eccentric on the crank-shaft.</p><p>Figs. 3 and 4. The form of engine here exhibited, is of still greater mathematical simplicity than the last, although its mechanical arrangements are probably more intricate. In this engine no member intervenes between the piston-rod and the crank. A cross-head carried by the piston-rod, open in the centre, permits the crank-pin, in its circle of rotation, to oscillate freely on alternate sides of the piston; and being itself powerfully confined to motion in the vertical direction only, by the slides on the columns of the framing, the vertical motion of the piston-rod is precluded from the production of any other dynamical effect than the most direct of all possible conversions of rectilineal into rotatory motion. The crosshead is marked H H in the figure, the columns being marked <hi rend="italic">m m.</hi> The other letters refer to the same parts as in the last figure.</p><p>Figs. 5 and 6. In these figures the high-pressure engine is represented in its most improved form for stationary purposes. It is analogous, in the arrangement of its principal parts, to the usual construction of Bolton and Watt's condensing-engine. A cast-iron base supporting six columns and an entablature, forms a framing upon which the parts of the engine are distributed, so as to form what is called a Portable Engine, being entirely independent of the building in which it may happen to be placed. At one extremity of the base is placed the cylinder A A, and at the other the crank-axle X, and fly-wheel W W. The motion is transferred from the piston P <hi rend="italic">p,</hi> through the great lever L L L, and connecting rod or crank-rod L K. The feed-pump <hi rend="italic">f f </hi>is in this instance worked from the point <hi rend="italic">m</hi> of the parallel motion, in the way generally adopted in condensing engines for working the air-pump, whose place in fact it here occupies. The valve is a short D-slide, worked by eccentric gear, <hi rend="italic">x x x x.</hi> S is the steam-pipe. The eduction pipes E are seen descending on both sides of the valve-casing; they unite in a common chamber beneath the cylinder, whence a pipe conveys the educted steam to the chimney, or to serve some other purpose, as the case may be. The governor acts as in the previous case. This drawing is taken from the form of engine manufactured by Messrs Caird and Company.</p><p>Figs. 7 and 8 is a form of the upright condensing engine manufactured by Messrs Carmichael of Dundee, and successfully applied by them to various purposes. It is compact and has been found to work well.</p><p>The cylinder A A is placed upon the floor, and on either side of it stands a cast iron column. These columns are hollow and are used as steam-pipes, S S S S, to convey the steam to the jacket of the cylinder, from which it finds its way into the valve-chest D. On the top of the columns is a cross-beam sustaining the crank axle, and the columns support guides m <hi rend="italic">m m m,</hi> on which, by means of wheels <hi rend="italic">g g,</hi> and a cross-head <hi rend="italic">g p g, </hi>the piston-rod P <hi rend="italic">p</hi> is maintained in its vertical position, so that the connecting rod <hi rend="italic">p</hi> K is directly attached to the crank-pin K. The air-pump G is worked from the crankshaft by means of a second crank or bend, and an eccentric a: ,r works directly the slide valve; <hi rend="italic">ff</hi> is the feedpump for the boiler, worked directly from the air-pump cross-head ; <hi rend="italic">w w w w</hi> is the governor, with its appendages ; C is the condenser ; N the cold well.</p><p>Plate <hi rend="smallcaps">cccclxix</hi>.
