<p><span class="font0">Latin city, Gabii, refused to join this league, and was assailed by Tarquinius. The struggle was long and severe ; but at length Tarquinius is said to have obtained possession&nbsp;of it by means of a stratagem, conducted by his son Sextus,&nbsp;similar to that by which Zopyrus gained possession of Babylon for Darius Hystaspis. He turned his arms next against&nbsp;the Volsci, and took Suessa Pometia, where he obtained a&nbsp;very great booty, and retained the tithe of it for his own share.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus powerful and enriched, he next proceeded to finish the great works left incomplete by his predecessors. He&nbsp;finished the cloaca maxima, and prepared to build the temple which his father, during the Sabine war, had vowed to&nbsp;the three great deities, Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva. For&nbsp;this purpose he levelled the brow of the hill, originally called by the Sabines Saturnius, but better known by its subsequent name, the Capitoline hill. In clearing away the&nbsp;ground for the foundation of this temple, a fresh human skull&nbsp;was found ; whence the augurs predicted that Rome should&nbsp;be the capital, or chief city of the world ; whence also the&nbsp;name by which that hill was always subsequently known.&nbsp;The hill had formerly been almost covered with altars and&nbsp;shrines consecrated by the Sabines. Tarquinius inquired by&nbsp;augury whether the deities, to whom these were sacred, would&nbsp;yield their places toJupiter, Juno, and Minerva. Theauguries&nbsp;allowed the removal of all except the shrines ofTerminus and&nbsp;Youth. This was interpreted as itself an omen, that the boundaries of the Roman empire should never recede, and that&nbsp;the state should be for ever young.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The chief builders of the capitol were Etruscan workmen, whose skill was superior to that of the Romans ; but Tarquinius compelled the Roman commons to work also as labourers, giving them merely a certain supply of provisions&nbsp;daily, as if they were mere slaves. They groaned wearily underneath his heavy yoke, but he ruled them with a high hand,&nbsp;and sent colonies of the most refractory of them to the frontiers of his conquests in the Volscian lands. Under the&nbsp;strong and imperious sway of this haughty, yet able tyrant,&nbsp;Rome reached an extent of territory and a pitch of power&nbsp;greatly beyond what it had ever before attained. There&nbsp;may, however, be the aspect of external greatness, and the&nbsp;reality of internal wretchedness ; but such a state of affairs&nbsp;cannot be permanent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Hitherto, the narrative diverges little from the plain course of what was, or might have been, historical truth ; and it is&nbsp;not undeserving of remark, that the conduct of Tarquinius&nbsp;Superbus is very natural for a prince who retained much of&nbsp;the Etruscan notions respecting hereditary rights, and scorn&nbsp;of the lower classes. The plan of employing the plebs in&nbsp;task-work, without any other support than a scanty allowance of food, might have been brought from the Nile, as&nbsp;easily as from Etruria ; and is some corroboration of the&nbsp;theory which would bring the hereditary half priest half&nbsp;noble caste of Lucumones from Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">About this time the strange story ofthe Sibyl is told. An unknown woman, of foreign aspect and manners, came to&nbsp;the king and offered him nine books of prophecies, for which&nbsp;she demanded a large sum. The king refused. The woman&nbsp;departed, burnt three of the books, and then returned and&nbsp;demanded the same sum for the remaining six. The king&nbsp;still refused ; and again the woman went away, burnt three,&nbsp;and returning, demanded the same price as at the first.&nbsp;Struck by this strange conduct, Tarquinius consulted the&nbsp;augurs, who told him that it was essential to the safety of&nbsp;Rome to procure the books. Accordingly he purchased them,&nbsp;and the woman departed, and was seen no more. These&nbsp;Sibylline books were then deposited in a chest of stone,&nbsp;and entrusted to the charge of two men of the highest&nbsp;rank, who kept them under ground in the Capitol. Their&nbsp;contents were never divulged ; nor were they ever consulted, except by a decree of the senate, and in times of the&nbsp;greatest public danger and distress.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the tyranny of Tarquinius had now nearly reached its limits. Various portents foreshewed its approaching overthrow. According to the legend, the first indications of the&nbsp;coming doom were seen in an unnatural violation of the&nbsp;sacred rites. A huge snake crawled out from an altar in&nbsp;the court of the palace, in the time of sacrifice ; the fire&nbsp;suddenly died out, and the snake devoured the victim. To&nbsp;ascertain what this prodigy portended, the king sent two of&nbsp;his sons to consult the oracle of Apollo at Delphi. They&nbsp;took with them their cousin, Lucius Junius Brutus, who&nbsp;had been brought up along with them in the palace, disregarded on account of his apparent apathy of manner, and&nbsp;laughed at as almost half an idiot. He was the younger son&nbsp;of a sister of Tarquinius by Marcus Junius ; and his elder&nbsp;brother had been put to death by his uncle for his wealth.&nbsp;To escape a similar fate he had feigned idiocy, and was&nbsp;consequently spared and despised. So runs the legend, to&nbsp;account for the name Brutus ; which, however, in old Latin&nbsp;is nearly synonymous with Severus, and may have been given&nbsp;him merely on account of his reserved gravity of manner.&nbsp;The answer of the Delphic oracle was, that the king&nbsp;should fall when a dog should speak with a human voice.&nbsp;This response was of course intended secretly to apply to&nbsp;Brutus, and his unexpected display of mental ability. The&nbsp;young princes also asked which of the king’s sons should&nbsp;succeed him ; and were answered in general terms, that the&nbsp;regal power should be enjoyed by the person who should&nbsp;first salute his mother. Brutus, as they were departing,&nbsp;stumbled, fell, and kissed tlle earth, thus fulfilling the meaning of the oracle.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Soon after this event, Tarquinius waged war against Ardea of the Rutuli, a people on the coast of Latium. The city was&nbsp;very strong both by nature and art, and made a protracted resistance. The army lay encamped around the walls, in order&nbsp;to reduce it by hunger, since they could not by direct force.&nbsp;While lying half idle at Ardea, the princes and their kinsmen, Brutus and Collatinus, happening to feast together,&nbsp;began in their gaiety to boast each of the beauty and virtue&nbsp;of his wife. Collatinus extolled his wife Lucretia as beyond&nbsp;all rivalry. On a sudden they resolved to ride to Rome and&nbsp;decide the dispute by ascertaining which of the respective&nbsp;ladies was spending her time in the most becoming and&nbsp;laudable manner. They found the wives of the king’s sons&nbsp;entertaining other noble ladies with a costly banquet. They&nbsp;then rode on to Collatia ; and though it was near midnight,&nbsp;they found Lucretia with her handmaids around her working&nbsp;at tbe loom. It was admitted that Lucretia was the most worthy lady ; and they returned again to the camp at Ardea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But the beauty and virtue of Lucretia had excited in the base heart of Sextus Tarquinius tlle fire of lawless passion.&nbsp;After a few days he returned to Collatia, where he was hospitably entertained by Lucretia as a kinsman of her husband. At midnight be secretly entered her chamber ; end&nbsp;when persuasions were ineffectual, he threatened to kill her&nbsp;and one of her male slaves, and laying the body by her side,&nbsp;to declare to Collatinus that he had slain her in the act of&nbsp;adultery. The dread of a disgrace to her memory, from&nbsp;which there should be no possible mode of wiping away the&nbsp;stain, produced an effect which the fear of death could not&nbsp;have done ; an effect not unnatural in a heathen, who might&nbsp;dread the disgrace of a crime more than its commission, but&nbsp;which shews the conventional morality and virtue of the&nbsp;time, how ill-founded, and almost weakly sentimental, in&nbsp;even that boasted instance of female virtue. Having accomplished his wicked purpose, Sextus again returned to the&nbsp;camp.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Immediately after his departure, Lucretia sent for her husband and father. Collatinus came from the camp accompanied by Brutus ; and her father, Lucretius, from the&nbsp;city, along with Publius Valerius. They found Lucretia&nbsp;sitting on her bed, weeping and inconsolable. In brief terms</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
