                <p><label>RICHARD II</label> (1367-1400), king of England, younger son of Edward the
                    Black Prince by Joan “ the Fair Maid of Kent,” was born at Bordeaux on the 6th
                    of January 1367. He was brought to England in 1371, and after his father’s death
                    was, on the petition of the Commons in parliament, created prince of Wales on
                    the 20th of November 1376. When Edward III. died, on the 21st of June 1377,
                    Richard became king. Popular opinion had credited John of Gaunt with designs on
                    the throne. This was not justified; nevertheless, the rivalry of the boy-king’s
                    uncles added another to the troubles due to the war, the Black Death and the
                    prospect of a long minority. At first the government was conducted by a council
                    appointed by parliament. The council was honest, but the difficulties of the
                    situation were too great. The ill-considered poll-tax of 1381 was the occasion,
                    though not the real cause, of the Peasants’ Revolt in that year. The ministcrs
                    were quite unequal to the crisis, and when Wat Tyler and bis followers got
                    possession of London, it was Richard who showed a precocious tact and confidence
                    in handling it. It was the boy-king who met and temporized with the rebels on
                    the 13th of June at Mile End, and again next day at Smithfield; and be who, with
                    courageous presence of mind, saved the situation when Tyler was killed, by
                    calling on them to take him for their leader. From this time Richard began to
                    assert himself. His chief ministers, appointed by parliament in 1382, were the
                    carl of Arundel and Michael de la Pole. Arundel Richard disliked, and dismissed
                    next year, when he began his personal government. Pole, whom he retained as
                    chancellor and made earl of Suffolk, was a well-chosen adviser. But others, and
                    especially his youthful favourite Robert de Vere, promoted by unheard-of honour
                    to be marquess of Dublin and duke of Ireland, were less worthy. Further, Richard
                    made his own position difficult by lavish extravagance and unseemly outbursts of
                    temper. He chafed under the restraint of his relatives, and therefore encouraged
                    John of Gaunt in his Spanish enterprise. This gave the less scrupulous Thomas of
                    Gloucester his opportunity. Gloucester, supported by Arundel, attacked his
                    nephew’s ministers in the parliament of 1386, and by open hints at deposition
                    forced Richard to submit to a council of control. When Richard, with the aid of
                    his friends and by the advice of subservient judges, planned a reversal of the
                    parliament, Gloucester, at the head of the so-called lords appellant,
                    anticipated him. Richard had been premature and ill-advised. Gloucester had the
                    advantage of posing as the head of the constitutional party. The king’s friends
                    were driven into exile or executed, and he himself forced to submit to the loss
                    of all real power (May 1388). Richard changed his</p>

                <p>methods, and when the lords appellant had lost credit, asserted himself
                    constitutionally by dismissing Gloucester’s supporters from office, and
                    appointing in their place well-approved men like William of Wykeham. In the next
                    parliament of 1390 the king showed himself ready to meet and conciliate his
                    subjects. The simultaneous return of John of Gaunt from Spain put a check on
                    Gloucester’s ambition. For seven years Richard ruled constitutionally and on the
                    whole well. The opposition was quiescent except for two outbreaks by Arundel:
                    the first was a violent attack on John of Gaunt, which rather strengthened
                    Richard’s position; the second was a wanton insult to the king at the funeral of
                    his queen.</p>
                <p>In January 1383 Richard had married Anne of Bohemia (1366-1394), daughter of the
                    emperor Charles IV. The marriage, though childless, was happy; had Anne lived or
                    borne a son the course of events might have been different. Her death on the 7th
                    of June 1394 was a great shock to Richard, and incidentally had important
                    consequences. Richard sought distraction by an expedition to Ireland, the first
                    visit of an English king for more than two centuries. In his policy there he
                    showed a wise statesmanship. At the same time he was negotiating for a permanent
                    peace with France, which was finally arranged in October 1396 to include his own
                    marriage with Isabella, daughter of Charles VI., a child of seven. Gloucester
                    criticized the peace openly, and there was some show of opposition in the
                    parliament of February 1397. But there was nothing to foreshadow the sudden
                    stroke by which in July Richard arrested Gloucester and his chief supporters,
                    the earls of Arundel and Warwick. The others of the five lords appellant, Henry
                    of Bolingbroke afterwards King Henry IV., and the earl of Nottingham, now
                    supported the king. Richard’s action was apparently in deliberate revenge for
                    the events of 1387-88. Gloucester, after a forced confession, died in prison at
                    Calais, smothered by his nephew’s orders. Arundel in a packed parliament was
                    condemned and executed; his brother Thomas archbishop of Canterbury was exiled.
                    The king’s friends, including Nottingham and Boling-broke, made dukes of Norfolk
                    and Hereford, were all promoted in title and estate. Richard himself was
                    rewarded for ten years’ patience by the possession of absolute power. He might
                    perhaps have established it if he could have exercised it with moderation. But
                    he declared that the laws of England were in his mouth, and supported his court
                    in wanton luxury by arbitrary methods of taxation. By the exile of Norfolk and
                    Hereford in September 1398 he seemed to have removed the last persons he need
                    fear. He was so confident that in May 1399 he paid a second visit to Ireland,
                    taking with him all his most trusted adherents. Thus when Henry landed at
                    Ravenspur in July he found only half-hearted opposition, and when Richard
                    himself returned it was too late. Ultimately Richard surrendered to Henry at
                    Flint on the 19th of August, promising to abdicate if his life was spared. He
                    was taken to London riding behind his rival with indignity. On the 30th of
                    September he signed in the Tower a deed of abdication, wherein he owned himself
                    insufficient and useless, reading it first aloud with a cheerful mien and ending
                    with a request that his cousin would be good lord to him. The parliament ordered
                    that Richard should be kept close prisoner, and he was sent secretly to
                    Pontefract. There in February 1400 he died: no doubt of the rigour of his winter
                    imprisonment, rather than by actual murder as alleged in the story adopted by
                    Shakespeare. The mystery of Richard’s death led to rumours that he had escaped,
                    and an impostor pretending to be Richard lived during many years under the
                    protection of the Scottish government. But no doubt it was the real Richard who
                    was buried without state in 1400 at King’s Langley, and honourably reinterred by
                    Henry V. at Westminster in 1413.</p>
                <p>Richard II. is a character of strange contradictions. It is difficult to
                    reconcile the precocious boy of 1381 with the wayward and passionate youth of
                    the next few years. Even if it be supposed that he dissembled his real opinions
                    during the period of his constitutional rule, it is impossible to believe that
                    the apparent indifference which he showed in his fall was the mere acting of a
                    part. His violent outbursts of passion perhaps give the best clue to a mercurial
                    and impulsive nature, easily elated and depressed. He had real ability, and in
                    his Irish policy, and in the preference which he gave to it over continental
                    adventure, showed a statesmanship in advance of his time. But this, in spite of
                    his lofty theory of kingship, makes it all the more difficult to explain his
                    extravagant bearing in his prosperity. His fall was due to the triumph of
                    national right over absolute government, but it was his personal conduct which
                    made it inevitable. In appearance Richard was tall and handsome, if effeminate.
                    He had some literary tastes, which were shown in fitful patronage of Chaucer,
                    Gower and Froissart. His fancy for splendid dress may have been due to an
                    artistic sense, which found better expression in his great buildings of
                    Westminster Hall and Abbey. Richard’s second queen, Isabella (1389-1409), was
                    born in Paris on the 9th of November 1389, and was married to the English king
                    at Calais in October, or November, 1396, but on account of the bride’s youth the
                    marriage was never consummated. When Richard lost his crown in 1399 Isabella was
                    captured by Henry IV.’s partisans and sent to Sonning, near Reading, while her
                    father, Charles VI., asked in vain for the restoration of his daughter and of
                    her dowry. In 1401 she was allowed to return to France; in 1406 she became the
                    wife of the poet, Charles, duke of Orleans, and she died on the 13th of
                    September 1409.</p>
