<p><span class="font0">spirit of his subjects more deeply than, at first sight, seems consistent with his prodigious facility in execution. The&nbsp;Massacre of the Innocents, in the Munich Gallery, is a&nbsp;composition that can leave no person unmoved,—mothers&nbsp;defending their children with nails and teeth. If Mrs&nbsp;Jameson terms this picture atrocious, it ought to be recollected how atrocious is the subject. When St Francis&nbsp;attempts to shelter the universe from the Saviour’s wrath&nbsp;(Brussels Gallery), Rubens, drawing his inspiration from&nbsp;a passage of St Germain, “ Ostendit mater filio pectus et&nbsp;ubera,” recalls to our memory that most dramatic passage&nbsp;of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Iliad</span><span class="font0"> when Hecuba, from the walls of Troy,&nbsp;entreats her son Hector to spare his life. The subject is&nbsp;inconsistent with the spirit of Christianity, says Waagen,&nbsp;evidently forgetting that to Catholic eyes nothing could&nbsp;be more impressive than the Virgin’s intervention at this&nbsp;supreme moment, when Christ, like another Jupiter,&nbsp;brandishes his thunderbolt against mankind. Rubens&nbsp;was a man of his time ; his studies of Italian art in no&nbsp;way led him back to the Quattrocentisti nor the Raffae-Ieschi ; their power was at an end. The influence of&nbsp;Michelangelo, Titian, Tintoretto, more especially Baroccio,&nbsp;Polydoro, and even Parmigiano, is no less visible with&nbsp;him than with those masters who, like Spranger, Chr.&nbsp;Schwartz, and Goltzius, stood high in public estimation&nbsp;immediately before his advent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the midst of the rarest activity as a painter, Rubens was now called upon to give proofs of a very different&nbsp;kind of ability. The truce concluded between Spain and&nbsp;the Netherlands in 1609 ended in 1621 ; archduke Albert&nbsp;died the same year. His widow sincerely wished to&nbsp;prolong the arrangement, still hoping to see the United&nbsp;Provinces return to the Spanish dominion, and in her&nbsp;eyes Rubens was the fittest person to bring about this&nbsp;conclusion. The painter’s comings and goings, however,&nbsp;did not remain unheeded, for the French ambassador&nbsp;writes from Brussels in 1624,—“Rubens is here to take&nbsp;the likeness of the prince of Poland, by order of the&nbsp;infanta. I am persuaded he will succeed better in this&nbsp;than in his negotiations for the truce.” But, if Rubens&nbsp;was to fail in his efforts to bring about an arrangement&nbsp;with the Netherlands, other events enabled him to render&nbsp;great service to the state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubens and Buckingham met in Paris iu 1625; a correspondence of some importance had been going on between the painter and the Brussels court, and before long it was&nbsp;proposed that he should endeavour to bring about a final&nbsp;arrangement between the crowns of England and Spain.&nbsp;The infanta willingly consented, and King Philip, who&nbsp;much objected to the interference of an artist, gave way&nbsp;on hearing, through his aunt, that the negotiator on the&nbsp;English side, B. Gerbier—a Fleming by birth—was likewise a painter. Rubens and Gerbier very soon met in&nbsp;Holland. “Rubens is come hither to Holland, where he&nbsp;now is, and Gerbier in his company, walking from town&nbsp;to town, upon their pretence of pictures,” writes Sir&nbsp;DudleyCarleton to Lord Conwayin July 1627, “which&nbsp;may serve him for a few days if he dispatch and be gone ;&nbsp;but yf he entertayne tyme here long, he will infallibly&nbsp;be Iayd hold of, or sent with disgrace out of the country&nbsp;.... This I have made known to Rubens least he&nbsp;should meet with a skorne what may in some sort reflect&nbsp;upon others.” Matters, however, went on very well, and&nbsp;Rubens volunteered to go to Spain and lay before the&nbsp;council the result of his negotiations (1628). Nine&nbsp;months were thus spent at Madrid ; they rank among the&nbsp;most important in Rubens’s career. He had brought with&nbsp;him eight pictures of various sizes and subjects as presents&nbsp;from the infanta, and he was also commissioned to take&nbsp;several portraits of the king and royal family. An&nbsp;equestrian picture of Philip IV., destroyed by fire in last&nbsp;century, became the subject of a poem by Lope de Vega,&nbsp;and the description enables us to identify the composition&nbsp;with that of a painting now in the Palazzo Pitti, ascribed&nbsp;to Velazquez.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Through a letter to Peiresc we hear of the familiar intercourse kept up between the painter and the king.&nbsp;Philip delighted to see Rubens at work in the studio prepared for him in the palace, where he not only left many&nbsp;original pictures, but copied for his own pleasure and profit the best of Titian’s. No less than forty works were&nbsp;thus produced, and, says the author of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Annals of the&nbsp;Artists of Spain,</span><span class="font0"> “the unwearied activity of his well-stored&nbsp;mind is exemplified by the fact that amid his many&nbsp;occupations he was seeking in the libraries materials for&nbsp;an edition of Marcus Aurelius, on which his friend Gaspard&nbsp;Gevaerts was then engaged.” An artistic event of some&nbsp;importance connected with the sojourn in Spain is the&nbsp;meeting of Rubens and Velazquez, to the delight, and we&nbsp;venture to add, advantage of both.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Great as was the king’s admiration of Rubens as a painter, it seems to have been scarcely above the value&nbsp;attached to his political services. Far from looking upon&nbsp;Rubens as a man of inferior calling, unworthy to meddle&nbsp;with matters of state, he now commissioned the painter&nbsp;to go to London as bearer of his views to Charles I.&nbsp;Giving up his long cherished hope of revisiting Italy on&nbsp;his return from Spain, Rubens, honoured with the title of&nbsp;secretary of the king’s privy council in the Netherlands,&nbsp;started at once on his new mission. Although he stopped&nbsp;but four days in Antwerp, he arrived in London just as&nbsp;peace had been concluded with France. In this conjuncture of affairs, it can hardly be doubted that the eminent&nbsp;position of Rubens as a painter greatly contributed to his&nbsp;ultimate success as an envoy. Received by Charles with&nbsp;genuine pleasure, he very soon was able to ingratiate&nbsp;himself so far as to induce the king to pledge his royal&nbsp;word to take part in no undertakings against Spain so&nbsp;long as the negotiations remained unconcluded, and all the&nbsp;subsequent endeavours of France, Venice, and the States&nbsp;found him immovable in this resolution. Although the&nbsp;privy council in Madrid, as well they might, passed&nbsp;several votes of thanks to Rubens, the tardiness of the&nbsp;Spanish court in sending a regular ambassador involved&nbsp;the unfortunate painter in distressing anxieties, and the&nbsp;tone of his dispatches is very bitter. But he speaks with&nbsp;the greatest admiration of England and the English,&nbsp;regretting that he should only have come to know the&nbsp;country so late. His popularity must have been very&nbsp;great, for on September 23, 1629, the university of Cambridge conferred upon him the honorary degree of master&nbsp;of arts, and on February 21, 1630, he was knighted, the&nbsp;king presenting him with the sword used at the ceremony,&nbsp;which is still preserved by the descendants of the artist.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the council at Madrid had to deliberate as to recognition of the title conferred upon Rubens in England,&nbsp;they remembered that Titian had been made a knight by&nbsp;the emperor Charles V., and the matter was settled without&nbsp;difficulty; but, the painter’s name having been mentioned&nbsp;as a possible envoy to the British court, Olivares objected&nbsp;that it was quite out of the question to make an ambassador of one who lived by the work of his hands.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Although, it seems, less actively employed as an artist in England than in Spain, Rubens, besides his sketches for&nbsp;the decoration of the Banqueting House at Whitehall,&nbsp;painted the admirable picture of the Blessings of Peace,&nbsp;now in the National Gallery. There is no reason to&nbsp;doubt, with Smith, that “His Majesty sat to him for his&nbsp;portrait, yet it is not a little remarkable that no notice&nbsp;occurs in any of the royal catalogues, or the writers of the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
