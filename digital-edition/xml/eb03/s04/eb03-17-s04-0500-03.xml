 a celebrated leader and high- prieſt of the Jews, who, after rendering the moſt important ſervices to his country, was at laſt treacherouſly ſlain by his ſon-in-law. See <hi rend="italic">the Hiſlory oſ the Jews, n⁰</hi> 15.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Simon</hi> <hi rend="italic">Magus,</hi> or the Sorcerer, was a native of Gitton, a village of Samaria. According to the usual practice of the Aſiatics of that age, he visited Egypt, and there probably became acquainted with the ſublime myſteries taught in the Alexandrian ſchool, and learned thoſe theurgic or magical operations by means of which it was believed that men might be delivered from the power of evil demons. Upon his return into his own country, the author of the Clementine Recognitions relates, that he impoſed upon his countrymen by high pretenſions to ſupernatural powers. And St Luke atteſts, that this artful fanatic, uſing ſorcery, had bewitched the people of Samaria, giving out that he was <hi rend="italic">ſome great one;</hi> and that he obtained ſuch general attention and reverence in Samaria, that the people all gave heed to him from the leaſt to the greateſt, saying, “ This man is the great power oſ God.”'</p><p>By the preaching of Philip the Deacon, he was with other Samaritans converted to the Chriſtian faith, and admitted into the infant church by the ordinance of baptiſm. His conversion, however, ſeems not to have been real ; for, upon seeing the miraculous effects of the laying on of the apoſtle’s hands, he offered them money, saying, “ Give me also this power, that on whom- ſoever I lay hands he may receive the Holy Ghoſt.” He probably thought Peter and John magicians like himſelf, but better ſkilled in the art of deceiving the multitude.</p><p>Being ſharply reproved for this impiety, he ſeems by his anſwer to have been made ſenſible of his sin ; but his repentance, <hi rend="italic">if</hi> sincere, was oſ ſhort duration. Returning to his former practices of impoſture, he travelled through various provinces of the empire, oppoſing the progreſs of the goſpel ; and arriving at Rome, he led astray vaſt numbers of people by his pretended miracles. How long he lived in that metropolis of the world, or in what manner he died, we have no accounts<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0507.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s04-0501"/>
that can be fully depended on. The Chriſtian writers tell us, that being raised in the air by two daemons, he was deprived <hi rend="italic">of</hi> their ſupport by the prayers of St Peter and St Paul, and falling, broke his legs. By ſome he is thought to have been the perſon mentioned by Suetonius, who, undertaking to fly in the preſence of Nero, fell to the ground with ſuch violence, that his blood ſpurted up to the gallery where the emperor was sitting.</p><p>The ſum of this impoſtor’s doctrine, diveſted of allegory, was, that from the Divine Being, as a fountain of light, flow various orders of aeons, or eternal natures, ſubsiſting within the plenitude of the divine eſſence ; that beyond theſe, in the order of emanation, are different claſſes of intelligences, among the loweſt of which are human souls ; that matter is the moſt remote production of the emanative power, which, on account of its infinite diſtance from the Fountain of Light, poſſeſſes ſluggiſh and malignant qualities, which oppoſe the divine operations, and are the cauſe of evil ; that it is the great design of philoſophy to deliver the foul from its impriſonment in matter, and reſtore it to that divine light from which it was derived ; and that for this purpoſe God had ſent him one of the firſt aeons among men. To his wife Helena he alſo aſcribed a ſimilar kind of divine nature, pretending that a female aeon inhabited the body of this woman, to whom he gave the name of Εννοια <hi rend="italic">, Wiſdom ;</hi> whence ſome Chriſtian fathers have ſaid, that he called her the <hi rend="italic">Holy Spirit.</hi> He alſo taught the transmigration of ſouls, and denied the resurrection of the body.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Simon</hi> (Richard), was born at Dieppe the 15th May 1638. He began his ſtudies among the prieſts of the Oratory in that city, but quitted their ſociety in a ſhort time From Dieppe he went to Paris, where he made great progreſs in the ſtudy of the oriental languages. Some time afterwards he joined the ſociety of the Oratory again, and became a prieſt of it in 1660. In 1670 he published ſome pieces of a ſmaller kind. In 1678 his Critical Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament appeared, but was immediately ſuppreſſed by the intrigues of Meſſieurs du Port Royal. It was reprinted the year after, and its excellence ſoon drew the attention of foreigners ; an edition of it was accordingly publiſhed at Amsterdam in Latin, and at London in Engliſh.</p><p>He died at Dieppe in 1712, at the age of 74.</p><p>He certainly poſſeſſed a vaſt deal of learning: his criticism is exact, but not always moderate ; and there reigns in his writings a ſpirit of novelty and singularity which raised him a great many adverſarſes. The most celebrated of these were Le Clerc, Vossius, Jurſeu, Du Pin, and Boſſuet. Simon wrote an answer to moſt of the books that were publiſhed againſt him, and diſplays a pride and obſtinacy in his controverſial writings which do him little honour.</p><p>He was the author of a great many books. The following are the principal: 1. The Ceremonies of the Jews, translated from the Italian of Leo of Modena, with a ſupplement concerning the ſects of the Barraites and Samaritans 2. L'Histoire <hi rend="italic">Critique du Vieux Tenement,</hi> “ The Critical Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament.” This is a very important work, and deserves the attention of every clergyman. He ſometimes, however, deviates from the road of integrity, to ſerve the cauſe of</p><p>the church of Rome, particularly in his endeavours to prove the uncertainty of the Hebrew language. Theſe paſſages have been very juſtly expoſed and confuted by Dr Campbell, in his ingenious Preliminary Diſſertations to his new Tranſlation of the Goſpels. 3. Critical Hiſtory of the Text of the New Teſtament. 4. Critical Hiſtory of the Versions of the New Teſtament. 5. Critical Hiſtory of the principal Commentators on the New Teſtament. 6. Inſpiration of the Sacred Books, 7. A tranſlation of the New Teſtament. This book was cenſured by Cardinal Noailles and Boſſuet. 8. The Hiſtory of the rise and progreſs of Ecclesiaſtical Revenues, which is commended by Voltaire, as is his Critical Hiſtory of the Old Teſtament. It reſulted from a quarrel with a community of Benedictines. 9. A new ſelect Library, which points out the good books in various kinds of literature, and the uſe to be made of them. 10. Critical Hiſtory of the Belief and Customs of the Nations on the Levant. 11. Critical Letters, &amp; c.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
