<p><span class="font0">within the urban limits, the Lagôa de Rodrigo de Freitas, near the Botanical Garden, separated from the sea by a narrow&nbsp;sand beach, which is being gradually filled in. Several small&nbsp;streams from the hills are conspicuous only in times of heavy&nbsp;rains.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The oldest part of the city, which includes the commercial section, lies between Castle and Santo Antonio hills on the S.&nbsp;and Sao Bento, Conceicao and Livramento hills on the N.,&nbsp;and extends inland to the Praça da Republica, though the&nbsp;defensive works in colonial times followed a line much nearer&nbsp;the bay. This section during the past century has extended&nbsp;southward along the bay shore in a string of suburbs known as&nbsp;the Cattete and Botafogo, with that of Larangeiras behind&nbsp;the Cattete in a pretty valley of the same name, and thence&nbsp;on or near the Atlantic coast as Largo dos Leoes, Copacabana&nbsp;and Gavea, the last including the Botanical Garden. The&nbsp;greatest development has been northward and westward, where&nbsp;are to be found the suburbs of Cidade Nova, Sao Christoväo,&nbsp;Engenho Novo, Praia Formoso, Pedregulho, Villa Isabel,&nbsp;Tijuca, and a number of smaller places extending far out&nbsp;on the line of the Central railway. The extreme length of&nbsp;the city along lines of communication is little less than 20 m.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Streets.—</span><span class="font0">Some of the most modern streets on the plain have been laid out with Spanish-American regularity, but much the&nbsp;greater part seems to have sprung into existence without any plan.&nbsp;Most of the streets of the old city are parallel and cross at right&nbsp;angles, but they are narrow and enclose blocks of unequal size.&nbsp;Each suburb is laid out independently, with straight streets where&nbsp;the ground permits, and crooked ones where the shore-line or&nbsp;mountain contour compels. Since the beginning of the 20th&nbsp;century large sums have been borrowed and expended on new&nbsp;avenues, the widening and straightening of old streets, and the&nbsp;improvement of the water-front between the Passeio Publico and&nbsp;the southern extremity of the Praia de Botafogo by the construction of a grand boulevard, partly on reclaimed land. One of these&nbsp;improvements consists of a central avenue cut across the old city&nbsp;from a point on the water-front near the Passeio Publico northward&nbsp;to the Saude water-front. The shore-line boulevard, called the&nbsp;Avenida Beira-Mar, is about 4.3 m. long, the, wider parts being&nbsp;filled in with gardens. It was undertaken in 1903, during the&nbsp;administration of President Rodrigues Alves, as part of a vast&nbsp;scheme to improve the sanitary and traffic conditions of the city,&nbsp;including the construction of a new shore-line and filling in the&nbsp;shallow parts of the shore, which had long been considered one of&nbsp;the prime causes of the unhealthy state, of the city. Another&nbsp;improvement was the completion and embellishment of the Mangue&nbsp;canal, originally designed as an entrance to a central market for&nbsp;the boats plying on the bay, but now destined for drainage purposes&nbsp;and as a public pleasure ground. This canal, as completed, is&nbsp;nearly 2 m. long, enclosed with stone walls, crossed by a number&nbsp;of iron bridges and bordered by lines of royal palms. The most&nbsp;famous street of the old city is the Rua do Ouvidor, running westward from the market-place to the Largo de Sao Francisco de&nbsp;Paula, and lined with retail shops, cafés and newspaper offices.&nbsp;It has long been a favourite promenade, and fills an important part&nbsp;in the social and political life of the city. The principal business&nbsp;street is the Rua Primeiro de Março, formerly called Rua Direita,&nbsp;which extends from the Praça 15 de Novembro northward to Sao&nbsp;Bento Hill. All these old streets, excepting the last, are narrow&nbsp;and paved with squared granite blocks, and have their vehicle&nbsp;traffic regulated to go in one direction only. The side walks are&nbsp;very narrow, and the gas lamps are attached to the walls of the&nbsp;buildings. The streets and suburbs are served by five groups of&nbsp;tramway lines—Jardim Botanico, Santa Thereza, Sao Christovao,&nbsp;Villa Isabel, and Carris Urbanos—all using electric traction but&nbsp;the last. The streets are lighted with electricity and gas, the&nbsp;Ouvidor and some other narrow streets having a great number&nbsp;of gas-pipe arches across them for decorative illumination on festal&nbsp;occasions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Parks.—</span><span class="font0">The public parks and gardens are numerous and include the Botanical Garden with its famous avenue of royal palms&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Oreodoxa regia);</span><span class="font0"> the Passeio Publico (dating from 1783), a small&nbsp;garden on the water-front facing the harbour entrance; the Jardim&nbsp;d’AccIamaçâo, forming part of the Praça da Republica (once known&nbsp;as the Campo de Sant’ Anna) with its artistic walks and masses of&nbsp;shrubbery; the Praça Tiradentes (the old Largo do Rocio, afterwards rechristened Praça da Constituiçâo) with its magnificent&nbsp;equestrian statue of Dom Pedro I. executed by the French sculptor&nbsp;Luiz Rochet; the Praça 15 de Novembro on the water-front facing&nbsp;the old city palace; and a number of smaller squares with and&nbsp;without gardens.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Water Supply and Sewerage Drainage.—</span><span class="font0">The water supply is derived from three sources: the small streams flowing&nbsp;down the mountain sides which serve small localities; the old&nbsp;Carioca aqueduct, dating from colonial times, which collects&nbsp;a considerable supply from the small streams of the Serra da&nbsp;Carioca and brings it into the city through a covered conduit&nbsp;which once crossed the gap between Santa Thereza and Santo&nbsp;Antonio hills on two ranges of stone arches (now used as a&nbsp;viaduct by the Santa Thereza Tramway Company); and the&nbsp;modern Rio do Ouro waterworks, which brings in an abundant&nbsp;supply from the Serra do Tinquâ, N.W. of the city—the length&nbsp;of the iron mains being 33 m. between the principal collecting&nbsp;reservoir and the main distributing reservoir at Pedregulho,&nbsp;near the Ponta do Cajù. There are three other distributing&nbsp;reservoirs in different parts of the city, and the supply, which&nbsp;has been augmented since the works were inaugurated in 1885,&nbsp;is good and ample. An extensive system of sewers was constructed by the City Improvements Co., an English corporation,&nbsp;which initiated the work in 1853; and a separate system&nbsp;of rain-water drains. The Leicester system is used because&nbsp;the greater part of the sewers are below sea-level, and it is&nbsp;necessary to use powerful pumps.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Climate.—</span><span class="font0">The climate of Rio de Janeiro is hot, humid and debilitating, the temperature ranging from 50° to 99-5° F.&nbsp;in the shade, with an average for the year of 74°, and the rainfall&nbsp;being about 44 in. The greater part of the city is only 2 or 3 ft.&nbsp;above sea-level, is surrounded by mountains, and has large&nbsp;areas of water, swamp and wet soil in its vicinity. But the&nbsp;unhealthiness of Rio de Janeiro in past years may be charged&nbsp;to insanitary conditions and not to the climate. Yellow&nbsp;fever, whose first recorded appearance was in December 1849,&nbsp;was for many years almost a regular yearly visitant, and the&nbsp;mortality from it bas been terrible. Smallpox also is practically endemic, owing in great part to negligent sanitary supervision. Since 1900 there have been several mild outbreaks of&nbsp;bubonic plague. These dangerous diseases are slowly disappearing as sanitary conditions are improved. The death-rate from&nbsp;tuberculosis, however, is high, and apparently shows no abatement. This is undoubtedly due to constitutional weakness&nbsp;arising from bad nutrition and the habit of sleeping in closed&nbsp;or badly ventilated apartments. Malarial fevers arc also&nbsp;common, and diseases of the digestive organs, in great part&nbsp;easily preventible, figure among the principal causes of death.&nbsp;According to official returns for the five years 1900-1905, the&nbsp;average number of deaths was 15,926, or 204 per 1000. Among&nbsp;the deaths 2789 were from tuberculosis, 1200 from smallpox,&nbsp;778 from malarial diseases, 331 from </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">la grippe,</span><span class="font0"> and 106 from&nbsp;beri-beri. There were no unusual epidemics during those&nbsp;years, and the rate given may be considered normal.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Buildings.—</span><span class="font0">There remain many public edifices and dwellings of the colonial period, severely plain in appearance, with heavy&nbsp;stone walls and tile roofs. The old city palace facing upon Praça&nbsp;15 de Novembro, once the residence of the fugitive Portuguese&nbsp;sovereign Dom Joao VI., is a good example. The 19th century&nbsp;brought no important modifications until near its close, when&nbsp;French and Italian styles began to appear, both in exterior decoration and in architectural design. The new Praça do Commercio&nbsp;(Merchants’ Exchange) and Post Office on Rua i° de Março, and&nbsp;the national printing office near the Largo da Carioca, are notable&nbsp;examples. Since then exterior ornamentation and architectural&nbsp;eccentricities have run riot, and the city is now a mixture of the&nbsp;plain one-storey and two-storey buildings of the Portuguese type,&nbsp;and fanciful modern creations, embellished with stucco and overtopping the others by many storeys. Although a metropolitan&nbsp;see, Rio has no cathedral, the old imperial chapel facing the Praça&nbsp;15 de Novembre being used for that purpose. The foundations&nbsp;were once laid for a great cathedral on the Largo de Sao Francisco&nbsp;de Paula, but the building stone was taken for a neighbouring&nbsp;theatre, and the foundations were afterwards used for the Polytechnic School. The most noteworthy church is the Candclaria&nbsp;church, in the commercial district, whose twin towers and graceful&nbsp;dome form one of the most conspicuous landmarks of the city.&nbsp;It was begun in 1775, but was not finished until near the end of the&nbsp;19th century. Its fine proportions, however, are concealed by&nbsp;commercial buildings ana by the narrow streets. Among many&nbsp;other churches, usually plain and bare of interior decoration, are&nbsp;the popular Sao Francisco de Paula church, on the square of&nbsp;that name; the Carmo church in Rua I<sup>o</sup> de Março; the Cruz dos&nbsp;Militares church in the same street; the Rosario church in the</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
