<p><span class="font0">in water (R. Bunsen, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.,</span><span class="font0"> 1862, 122, p. 351). A somewhat similar process based on the varying solubilities of the corresponding alums has also been devised by Redtenbacher </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Jour,&nbsp;prak. Chem.,</span><span class="font0"> 1865, 95, p. 148). The metal is prepared by&nbsp;distilling the carbonate with carbon (an explosive compound&nbsp;similar to that obtained from potassium and carbon monoxide is&nbsp;liable to be formed simultaneously); by reducing the hydroxide with aluminium: 4RbOH+2Al = Rb<sub>2</sub>O Al2O3+2Rb+2H<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>(N. Beketoff, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ber.,</span><span class="font0"> 1888, 21, p. 424 ref.); by reducing&nbsp;the carbonate (C. Winckler, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ber.,</span><span class="font0"> 1890, 23, p. 51) or the&nbsp;hydroxide with magnesium (H. Erdmann and P. Kothner,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ann.,</span><span class="font0"> 1899, 294, p. 55); and by heating the fused chloride&nbsp;with calcium in an exhausted glass tube at 400-500° C.&nbsp;(L. Hackspill, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font0"> 1905, T41, p. 101). The metal&nbsp;was first obtained electrolytically in 19TO by electrolysing the&nbsp;fused hydroxide in a nickel vessel, with an iron wire cathode&nbsp;and iron cylinder anode; the product on cooling being opened&nbsp;under pyridine cooled by a freezing mixture (G. von Hcvesy,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Zeit. anorg. Chem.,</span><span class="font0"> 1910, 67, p. 242). It is a silvery white&nbsp;metal which melts at 38*5° C. and has a specific gravity of 1*52.&nbsp;It oxidizes rapidly on exposure to air, and decomposes cold&nbsp;water very rapidly. It closely resembles caesium and potassium in its general properties. The rubidium salts are generally&nbsp;colourless, mostly soluble in water and isomorphous with the&nbsp;corresponding potassium salts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Rubidium hydride, RbH, was obtained in the form of colourless needles by H. Moissan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font0"> 1903, 136, p. 587) from the&nbsp;direct combination of its constituent elements. It rapidly dissociates when heated in vacuo to 300° C. The existence of the&nbsp;oxide Rt^O appears to be doubtful, the results of Erdmann and&nbsp;Kdthner </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(loc. cit.)</span><span class="font0"> pointing to the formation of RbOa by the direct&nbsp;union of the metal with dry oxygen. E. Rengade </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Comptes rendus,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">1907, 144, p. 920), by partially oxidizing the tietal in a current of&nbsp;dry oxygen and removing excess of metal by distillation in vacuo,&nbsp;has obtained oxides of composition Rb^ (yellowish white),&nbsp;Rb<sub>2</sub>O3 (black) and Rb<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> (yellow). Rubidium hydroxide, RbOH, is&nbsp;a colourless solid which is formed by the action of rubidium on water,&nbsp;or by the addition of baryta water to a solution of rubidium sulphate.&nbsp;It is readily soluble in water, the solution being very alkaline and&nbsp;caustic. It melts at 301 °. Evaporation of the aqueous solution at&nbsp;15° C. deposits a crystalline hydrated hydroxide of composition&nbsp;RbOH*2H<sub>2</sub>O (R. de Forcrand, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font0"> 1909» 149, p. </span><span class="font1">1341).&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">Rubidium chloride, RbCl, is formed on burning rubidium in chlorine,&nbsp;or on dissolving the hydroxide in aqueous hydrochloric acid. It&nbsp;crystallizes in colourless cubes and volatilizes when heated very&nbsp;strongly. It is soluble in water and combines with many metallic&nbsp;chlorides to form double salts. It combines also with iodine&nbsp;chloride and bromide and with bromine chloride and with bromine&nbsp;(H. L. Wells and H. L. Wheeler, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Amer. Jour. Sci.,</span><span class="font0"> 1891 (3), 43,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">P Rubidium sulphate, Rl^SO«, is formed by the action of sulphuric acid on the carbonate or hydroxide of the metal, or by the action&nbsp;of milk of lime on rubidium alum, the excess of lime being precipitated by rubidium carbonate and the solution neutralized by&nbsp;sulphuric acid. It forms large colourless hexagonal crystals.&nbsp;Several sulphides of the metal have been described by W. Biltz&nbsp;and E. Wilke-Dorfurt </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Zeit. anorg. Chem.,</span><span class="font0"> 1906, 48, p. 297). The&nbsp;normal sulphide, Rb<sub>2</sub>S*4HiO, is colourless, and when heated in&nbsp;aqueous solution with the requisite amount of sulphur is transformed&nbsp;into the yellow tetrasulpnide, Rb<sub>2</sub>S<sub>4</sub>*2H<sub>2</sub>O. A pentasulphide,&nbsp;RthSfi, which crystallizes in red prisms melting at 223° C., is also&nbsp;obtained by the direct union of the normal sulphide with sulphur.&nbsp;When heated in a current of hydrogen it is transformed into the&nbsp;colourless disulphide, whilst if the heating be carried out in a current&nbsp;of nitrogen it yields the trisulphide, RbjSj’HjO. These sulphides&nbsp;are much less hygroscopic than the corresponding caesium compounds. Rubidium nitrate, RbNOn. obtained by the action of&nbsp;nitric acid on the carbonate, crystallizes in needles or prisms and&nbsp;when strongly heated is transformed into a mixture of nitrite&nbsp;and oxide. Rubidium ammonium, RbNH<sub>8</sub>, was prepared by H.&nbsp;Moissan </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Comptes rendus,</span><span class="font0"> 1903, 136, p. ii77) by the action of liquid&nbsp;ammonia on rubidium. Tne product combines with acetylene to&nbsp;form rubidium acetylide acetylene, Rb2C<sub>2</sub>*C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>, which on heating&nbsp;in vacuo loses acetylene and leaves a residue of rubidium carbide&nbsp;Rb<sub>2</sub>C<sub>2</sub> (ibid. p. 1217). Rubidium carbonate, Rt^COg, formed by the&nbsp;addition of ammonium carbonate to rubidium hydroxide, is a&nbsp;crystalline mass which melts in its water of crystallization when&nbsp;heated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The atomic weight of rubidium was determined by R. Bunsen </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Pogg. Ann.,</span><span class="font0"> 1861, 113, p. 339), Picard </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Zeit. anal. Chem.,</span><span class="font0"> 1862, 1,&nbsp;p. 510) and Godeffroy </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Ann.,</span><span class="font0"> 1876, </span><span class="font1">181, p. </span><span class="font0">185), the methods being&nbsp;basea on the conversion of rubidium halides into the corresponding&nbsp;silver salt, and the values obtained vary from 85*40 to 85*50. The&nbsp;determination of E. H. Archibald </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(Jour. Chem. Soe.,</span><span class="font0"> 1904, 85, p. 776)&nbsp;from the analysis of the chloride and bromide gives the mean value&nbsp;as 85*485 (0 = 16).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RUBINSTEIN, ANTON GRIGOROVICH (1829-1894), Russian pianist, born of Jewish parentage on the 28th of&nbsp;November 1829 at Wechwotynetz, in Podolia, was the son of&nbsp;a pencil manufacturer who migrated to Moscow. The Rubinstein family, at the dictate of Anton’s grandfather Roman&nbsp;Rubinstein, had all been baptized at the time of the ukase&nbsp;against the Jews issued in 1830 by the Tsar Nicholas. Anton&nbsp;was then one year old. Besides his mother he had but one&nbsp;teacher, the piano master Alexander Villoing, of whom he&nbsp;declared at the end of his own career that he had never met a&nbsp;better. In July 1838 Rubinstein appeared in the theatre of&nbsp;the Petrowski Park at Moscow; and in the year following he&nbsp;went to Paris after Villoing, and in 1840 played before Liszt.&nbsp;For some time after this Rubinstein travelled in Holland,&nbsp;Germany and Scandinavia, and reached England in 1842,&nbsp;where on the 20th of May he made his first appearance at a&nbsp;Choral Fund concert. In 1845, after a brief visit to Moscow&nbsp;in 1843, he went with his family (including his brother Nikolaus)&nbsp;to Berlin in order to complete his musical education. Dehn&nbsp;was their master, and Mendelssohn, whom Rubinstein had&nbsp;met previously in London, their best friend. The sudden&nbsp;death of Rubinstein’s father necessitated the withdrawal of&nbsp;his mother and Nikolaus to Moscow, while Anton, on Dehn’s&nbsp;advice, went to Vienna to seek a livelihood. Hence, after&nbsp;more hard study for nearly two years, he went with the flautist&nbsp;Heindl, and later alone, on a concert tour in Hungary; and&nbsp;the outbreak of the revolution in Vienna preventing his return&nbsp;there, he went via Berlin to St Petersburg, where the Grand&nbsp;Duchess Hélène appointed him Kammervirtuos. About this&nbsp;time an unfortunate error of the police nearly caused his expatriation to Siberia, from which he was saved by his patroness.&nbsp;During the next eight years Rubinstein spent most of his time&nbsp;in St Petersburg studying, playing and composing. His&nbsp;opera </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Dmitri Donskoi</span><span class="font0"> was produced there in 1851, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Toms&nbsp;der Narr</span><span class="font0"> in 1853. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Sibirischen Jäger,</span><span class="font0"> written about the&nbsp;same time, was not produced. On the advice of his patroness&nbsp;and Count Wilhorski he visited Hamburg and Leipzig, and&nbsp;arrived for the second time in London in 1857, when at a&nbsp;Philharmonic concert he introduced his own concerto in G.&nbsp;In the following year he was in London again, having in the&nbsp;meantime been appointed Concert Director of the Royal&nbsp;Russian Musical Society. In 1862, in collaboration with Carl&nbsp;Schuberth, he founded the St Petersburg Conservatorium, of&nbsp;which he was director until 1867. In 1868 he travelled in&nbsp;Germany, France and England, and remained for some time&nbsp;in Vienna, where he introduced a large number of his own&nbsp;compositions. Thence he went to America in 1872 and 1873,&nbsp;when he returned to Russia, and after a short rest set off once&nbsp;more on concert tours. In this manner the rest of his life&nbsp;was spent, until in 1885 he began a series of historical recitals&nbsp;of immense interest, which he gave in most of the chief European capitals. He died on the 20th of November 1894.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In addition to the works already named, Rubenstein left compositions in almost every known form. Among other of&nbsp;his operas are </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Kinder der Haide, F er amors (Latta Roukh),&nbsp;Nero, Der Dämon</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die Makkabäer,</span><span class="font0"> this last perhaps more&nbsp;frequently played than all the others, of which the chief defect&nbsp;is their lack of dramatic point. On the subject of oratorio&nbsp;Rubinstein held original views, though his attempt to realize&nbsp;them in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Moses</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Christus</span><span class="font0"> was not completely successful,&nbsp;while his efforts in Berlin and London to found a Sacred Theatre&nbsp;failed entirely. Nevertheless he himself regarded the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Christus&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">as his greatest achievement. The most familiar of his five&nbsp;symphonies are the “ Ocean ” and the “ Dramatic?’ He&nbsp;wrote scores on scores of pianoforte works, from complex&nbsp;concertos to the most commonplace </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">salonstücke',</span><span class="font0"> abundance&nbsp;of concerted chamber-music, and a number of songs and duets,&nbsp;which enjoyed some popularity. He also published several&nbsp;books, including his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Reminiscences</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Die geistliche Oper.</span></p>
