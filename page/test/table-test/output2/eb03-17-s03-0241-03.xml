is a town of Champagne in France, in E. Long. 4. 45. N. Lat. 49. 46. This is the capital of a principality of the ſame name, ſituated on the Maeſe, ſix miles from Bouillon, and fifteen from Charleville. Its ſituation on the frontiers of the territory of Liege, Namur, and Limburg, formerly rendered it one of the keys of the kingdom. It is extremely well fortified, and defended by a ſtrong citadel. The caſtle is ſituated on a rock, ſurrounded with large towers and ſtrong walls: here you ſee a moſt beautiful magazine of ancient arms. The governor’s palace is oppoſite the caſtle. From the ramparts you have a moſt agreeable proſpect of the Maeſe and the neighbouring country. Though the town is but ſmall, yet it is full of tradeſmen, as tanners, weavers, dyers, &amp; c. the manufacture of fine cloth in this city employing a great number of hands. The principality of Sedan formerly belonged to the duke of Bouillon, who was obliged in the beginning of the laſt century to reſign it to the crown.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SEDAN-chAir</hi> is a covered vehicle for carrying a ſingle perſon, ſuſpended by two poles, and borne by two men, hence denominated <hi rend="italic">chairmen.</hi> They were firſt introduced in London in 1634, when Sir Sanders Duncomb obtained the ſole privilege to uſe, let, and hire a number of the ſaid covered chairs for fourteen years.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
