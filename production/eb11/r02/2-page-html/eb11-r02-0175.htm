<p><span class="font2">Cerinthian authorship and urges that it was not written by the apostle, on the ground of its difference in language, style&nbsp;and contents from the other Johannine writings. Its author&nbsp;was some inspired man bearing the same name as the son of&nbsp;Zebedee. The arguments of Dionysius were repeated by Eusebius,&nbsp;who ascribed the work to the presbyter John mentioned by&nbsp;Papias (Eus. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">H.E.</span><span class="font2"> iii. 39) and was in doubt whether he should&nbsp;place Revelation among the spurious (pô^a)works </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(H.E.</span><span class="font2"> iii. 25.4)&nbsp;or the accepted (όμολογov/xera).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Eastern Church.—</span><span class="font2">In the Eastern Church the views of Dionysius and Eusebius were generally accepted. With the exception of Methodius and Pamphilus the hook was not received by&nbsp;Eastern scholars. Thus it was either not mentioned or disowned by Cyril of Jerusalem, Chrysostom, Theodore of Mop-suestia, Theodoret and Amphilochus of Iconium. It is absent&nbsp;from the so-called Synopsis of Athanasius, the Stichometry of&nbsp;Nicephorus, the List of Sixty Books and other authoritative&nbsp;documents. It formed no part of the Peshitta New Testament.&nbsp;It was apparently unknown to Ephraem. Even when later&nbsp;it found a place in the Philoxeman and Harclean versions it&nbsp;never became a familiar book to the Syrian Churches, while it&nbsp;was unhesitatingly rejected by the Nestorian and Jacobite&nbsp;Churches.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">But though the Syrian Church maintained this Unconciliatory attitude to the book, opposition to it began gradually to disappear in the rest of the East. Thus it came to be acknowledged by Athanasius, Isidore of Pelusium, Gregory of Nyssa,&nbsp;and others. Commentaries on the book were written by&nbsp;Andreas, archbishop of Caesarea, in the 5th century, and Arethas&nbsp;in the 9th.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Western Church.—</span><span class="font2">In the Western Church, Revelation was accepted by all writers from Hippolytus onward with the&nbsp;exception of Jerome, who relegated it to the class lying between&nbsp;the canonical and apocryphal. The authenticity of the book&nbsp;was unquestioned thenceforward till the Reformation, when&nbsp;the view of Jerome was revived by Erasmus, Carlstadt, Luther&nbsp;and others under various forms. In the Lutheran Church this&nbsp;opposition lasted into the next century, but in the Reformed&nbsp;it gave way much earlier. That Revelation has retained its&nbsp;place in the canon is due not to its extravagant claims to inspiration or its apocalyptical disclosures, but to its splendid&nbsp;faith and unconquerable hope, that have never failed to awake&nbsp;the corresponding graces in every age of the Church’s history.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The History of Interpretation.</span><span class="font2">—This is a most fruitful subject, and the study of it helps to settle other related questions. We&nbsp;first of all might divide the methods of interpretation into two&nbsp;classes: I. Methods which presuppose the literal unity of the&nbsp;book; II. Methods which presuppose some breach of this unity&nbsp;either in the plan of the book as a whole or in some of its details.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">I. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Methods presupposing the Literal Unity of the Book.—</span><span class="font2">Where the book was accepted the problem of its interpretation was&nbsp;differently dealt with according to the age and environment of&nbsp;the interpreter. The book was first taken in a severely literal&nbsp;sense, and particularly in it$ chiliastic doctrine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">i. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Chiliastic Interpretation.—</span><span class="font2">Revelation was held to teach chiliasm, or the doctrine of the literal reign of 1000 years.&nbsp;Amongst the chiliasts were Cerinthus, Papias, Justin, Irenaeus,&nbsp;Hippolytus, TertuIlian and Victorinus.@@<sup>1</sup> When the Church&nbsp;obtained the mastery of the world this method came naturally&nbsp;to be abandoned in favour of a spiritualistic interpretation, to&nbsp;which we shall presently refer. But the growing secularism of&nbsp;the Church led to a revival of the former method in the beginning&nbsp;of the 13th century amongst the Franciscans. Thus Joachim&nbsp;of Floris in his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Expositio magni abbatis Ioachimi in Apoc.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">teaches that Babylon is Rome, the Beast from the Sea Islam,&nbsp;the False Prophet the heretical sects of the day, and that on&nbsp;the close of the present age which was at hand the millennium&nbsp;would ensue. This method of interpretation was pursued to&nbsp;extravagant lengths by other Franciscans and was subsequently</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font2">adopted by the Protestant reformers, who could justify their identification of the papacy with thc Antichrist from books&nbsp;written within the Roman communion. Joachim was the first&nbsp;to apply the <sup>44</sup> recapitulation ” theory to Revelation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">ii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Spiritualistic Interpretation.—</span><span class="font2">The founder of this school of&nbsp;interpretation was Ticonius thc Montanist </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(floruit </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">a.d.</span><span class="font1"> 380),&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">though he followed therein the precedent set by Origen. His&nbsp;interpretation is on the whole mystical. Historical fulfilments,&nbsp;if not excluded, are not sought for. The millennium is the&nbsp;period between the first and second comings of Christ. The&nbsp;method of Ticonius was dominant in the Church down to the&nbsp;middle ages, amongst his followers being such notable churchmen as Augustine, Primasius, Cassiodorus, Bede, Anselm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">iii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Universal Historical Method of Interpretation.—</span><span class="font2">A counterattempt over against Joachim to interpret Revelation in the&nbsp;light of history was made by Nicolas of Lyra (1329, in his&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Postilte),</span><span class="font2"> following (?) therein the lead of Petrus Aureolus (1317).&nbsp;Here for the first time a consistently elaborated world-historical&nbsp;interpretation is carried out from the reign of Domitian to&nbsp;Lyra’s own period. Under this method might be classed the&nbsp;expositions of Luther, Osiander, Striegel, Fladus, Gerhard and&nbsp;Calovius; and English writers such as Napier, Mede and&nbsp;Newton. Throughout these later commentaries a strong&nbsp;antipapal interest which identified the pope with the Antichrist&nbsp;holds a central place—a doctrine which, as we have seen, goes&nbsp;back historically to the immediate disciples of Joachim and&nbsp;like-minded Franciscans.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">iv. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Contemporary-Historical Method.—</span><span class="font2">Underthe stress of the&nbsp;Protestant attack there arose new methods on the papal side,&nbsp;and their authors were the Spanish Jesuits, Ribeira </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ob.</span><span class="font2"> 1591)&nbsp;and Alcasar </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ob.</span><span class="font2"> 1614). With these writers we have the beginning of a scientific method of interpretation. They approach&nbsp;the book from the standpoint of the author and seek the due&nbsp;to his writings in the events of his time. It is from these scholars&nbsp;that subsequent writers of Revelation have learnt how to study&nbsp;this book scientifically.@@<sup>2</sup> This method was adopted and&nbsp;developed by Grotius,@@<sup>3</sup> Hammond, Clericus, Sender, Corredi&nbsp;and Eichhorn, Lücke, Bleek and Ewald, and the consciousness&nbsp;that Rome and not Jerusalem was the object of attack in&nbsp;Revelation became increasingly clear in the works of these&nbsp;scholars. The work of Ramsay, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">The Letters to the Seven&nbsp;Churches</span><span class="font2"> (1904), is a pure representative of this method.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">V.-vii. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Continuously Historical, Eschatological@@<sup>4</sup> and Symbolical Methods.</span><span class="font2">—These methods are now generally regarded as unscientific, and call for no further notice here save’to mention&nbsp;that the first' was upheld by Hcngstenberg, Ebrard, Maitland,&nbsp;Elliott, &amp;c.; the second by Kliefoth, Beck, Zahn, and the third&nbsp;by Auberlen, Luthardt, Milligan and Benson.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The learned Cambridge Commentary by Swete </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(The Apocalypse of John,</span><span class="font2"> 2nd ed., 1907) makes use of several of the methods of interpretation enumerated above. Thus Dr Swete&nbsp;writes (p. ccxviii) of his work: “ With the ' preterists ’ (contemporary-historical) it will take its stand on the circumstances&nbsp;of the age and locality to which the book belongs, and will&nbsp;connect the greater part of the prophecy with the destinies of&nbsp;the empire under which the prophet lived; with the ' futurists ’&nbsp;(eschatological) it will look for fulfilments of St John’s pregnant&nbsp;words in times yet to come. With the school of Auberlen and&nbsp;Benson it will find in the Apocalypse a Christian philosophy of&nbsp;history; with the 'continuous-historical ’ school it can see</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>1</sup> The oldest Latin commentary was written by this scholar </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(ob. </span><span class="font1">303). He was the first in extant literature to interpret certain&nbsp;passages in Revelation of Nero.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>2</sup> The Jesuit Tuan Mariana was the first after Victorinus to explain &quot;the wounded head ” as referring to Nero. This interpretation&nbsp;was introduced, into Protestant exegesis by Corrodi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>3</sup> The beginnings of the literary-critical method are to be found in Grotius. Starting from the different dates assigned by tradition to&nbsp;the exile to Patmos and the different chronological relations implied&nbsp;in the book itself, he conjectured that the Apocalypse was composed&nbsp;of several works of St John, written in different places and at different&nbsp;times, some before, some after a.d. 70. Herein he was followed by&nbsp;Hammond and Lakemacher, but the idea was before its time and&nbsp;practically died stillborn.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">@@@<sup>4</sup> Or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">futurist.</span><span class="font1"> While it is impossible to interpret the Apocalypse scientifically as a whole by the eschatological method, there are undoubtedly some sections in it which must be so interpreted.</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
