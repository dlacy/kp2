<p><span class="font0">ROOD, a quantity of land equal to 40 ſquare perches, or the fourth part of an acre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ROOF, expreſſes the covering of a houſe or building, by which its inhabitants or contents are protected ſrom the injuries of the weather. It is perhaps the&nbsp;eſſential part of a houſe, and is frequently uſed to expreſs the whole. To </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">come under a perſon’'s roof,</span><span class="font0"> is to&nbsp;enjoy his protection and ſociety, to dwell with him.&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tectum</span><span class="font0"> was uſed in the ſame ſenſe by the Romans.&nbsp;To be within our walls rather expreſſes the being in&nbsp;our poſſeſſion : a roof therefore is not only an eſſential&nbsp;part of a houſe, but it even ſeems to be its characteriſtic feature. The Greeks, who have perhaps excelled&nbsp;all nations in taſte, and who have given the moſt perfect model of architectonic ordonnance within a certain&nbsp;limit, never erected a building which did not exhibit&nbsp;this part in the diſtincteſt manner ; and though they&nbsp;borrowed much of their model from the orientals, as&nbsp;will be evident to any who compares their architecture&nbsp;with the ruins of Perſepolis, and of the tombs in the&nbsp;mountains of Sciras, they added that form of roof&nbsp;which their own climate taught them was neceſſary for&nbsp;ſheltering them from the rains. The roofs in Perſia&nbsp;and Arabia are flat, but thoſe of Greece are without&nbsp;exception doping. It ſeems therefore a groſs violation&nbsp;of the true principles of taſte in architecture (at leaſt&nbsp;in the regions of Europe), to take away or to hide the&nbsp;roof of a houſe ; and it muſt be aſeribed to that rage for&nbsp;novelty which is ſo powerful in the minds of the rich.&nbsp;Our anceſtors ſeemed to be of a very different opinion,&nbsp;and turned their attention to the ornamenting of their&nbsp;roofs as much as any other part of a building. They ſhowed them in the moſt conſpicuous manner, running them&nbsp;up to a great height, broke them into a thouſand fanciful&nbsp;ſhapes, and ſtuck them full of highly dreſſed windows.&nbsp;We laugh at this, and call it Gothic and clumſy ; and&nbsp;our great architects, not to offend any more in this&nbsp;way, conceal the roof altogether by parapets, baluſtrades, and other contrivances. Our forefathers certainly did offend againſt the maxims of true taſte, when&nbsp;they enriched a part of a houſe with marks of elegant&nbsp;habitation, which every ſpectator muſt know to be a&nbsp;cumberſome garret : but their ſucceſſors no leſs offend,&nbsp;who take off the cover of the houſe altogether, and&nbsp;make it impoſſible to know whether it is not a mere&nbsp;ikreen or colonnade we are looking at.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">We cannot help thinking that Sir Chriſtopher Wren erred when he ſo induſtriouily concealed the roof of&nbsp;St Paul’s church in London. The whole of the upper&nbsp;order is a mere ſcreen. Such a quantity of wall would&nbsp;have been intolerably offenſive, had he not given it ſome&nbsp;appearance of habitation by the mock windows or&nbsp;niches. Even in this ſtate it is gloomy, and it is odd,&nbsp;and is a puzzle to every ſpectator—There ſhould be nd&nbsp;puzzle in the deſign of a building any more than in a&nbsp;diſcourſe. It has been ſaid that the double roof of our&nbsp;great churches which have aiſles is an incongruity,&nbsp;looking like a houſe ſtanding on the top of another&nbsp;houſe. But there is not the leaſt occaſion for ſuch a&nbsp;thought. We know that the aiſle is a ſhed, a cloiſter.&nbsp;Suppoſe only that the lower roof or ſhed is hidden by&nbsp;.a baluſtrade, it then becomes a portico, againſt which&nbsp;the cennoiſſeur has no objection : </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">yet there is </span><span class="font0">no difference ; ſor the portico </span><span class="font1">muſt </span><span class="font0">have a cover, otherwiſe it&nbsp;is neither a ſhed, cloiſter, nor portico, any more than a&nbsp;building without a roof is a houſe. A houſe without </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">viſible roof is like a mah abroad without his hat ; and&nbsp;we may add, that the whim of concealing the chimneys,&nbsp;now ſo faſhionable, changes a houſe to </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">barn or ſtore-houſe. A houſe ſhould not be a copy of any thing.&nbsp;It has a title to be an original ; and a ſcreen like houſe&nbsp;and a pillar-like candleſtick are ſimilar ſoleciſms in&nbsp;taſte.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The architect is anxious to preſent a fine object, and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">very ſimple outline diſcuſſes all his concerns with the&nbsp;roof. He leaves it to the carpenter, whom he frequently puzzles (by his arrangements) with coverings almoſt&nbsp;impoſſible to execute. Indeed it is ſeldom that the idea&nbsp;of a roof is admitted by him into his great compoſitions;&nbsp;or if he does introduce it, it is from mere affectation,&nbsp;and we may ſay pedantry. A pediment is frequently&nbsp;ſtuck up in the middle of a grand front, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font0">a ſituation&nbsp;where a roof cannot perform its office ; for the rain&nbsp;that is ſuppoſed to flow down its ſides muſt be received&nbsp;on the top of the level buildings which flank it. This&nbsp;is a manifeſt incongruity. The tops of dreſſed windows,&nbsp;trifling porches, and ſometimes a projecting portico, are&nbsp;the only ſituations in which we ſee the figure of a roof&nbsp;correſpond with its office. Having thus loſt ſight of&nbsp;the principle, it is not ſurpriſing that the draughtſman&nbsp;(for he ſhould not be called architect) runs into every&nbsp;whim : and we ſee pediment within pediment, a round&nbsp;pediment, a hollow pediment, and the greateſt of all&nbsp;abſurdities, a broken pediment. Nothing could ever&nbsp;reconcile us to the ſight of a man with a hat without&nbsp;its crown, becauſe we cannot overlook the uſe of a&nbsp;hat.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But when one builds </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font0">houſe, ornament alone will not do. We muſt have a cover ; and the enormous ex-pence and other great inconveniences which attend the&nbsp;concealment of this cover by parapets, baluſtrades, and&nbsp;ſcreens, have obliged architects to conſider the pent&nbsp;roof as admiſſible, and to regulate its form. Any man&nbsp;of ſenſe, not under the influence of prejudice, would be&nbsp;determined in this by its ſitneſs for anſwering its purpoſe. A high pitched roof will undoubtedly ſhoot off&nbsp;the rains and ſnows better than one of a lower pitch.&nbsp;The wind will not ſo eaſily blow the dropping rain in&nbsp;between the ſlates, nor will it have ſo much power to&nbsp;ſtrip them off. A high pitched roof will exert a ſmaller thruſt on the walls, both becauſe its ſtrain is leſs horizontal, and becauſe it will admit of lighter covering.&nbsp;But it is more expenſive, becauſe there is more of it.&nbsp;It requires a greater ſize of timbers to make it equally&nbsp;ſtrong, and it expoſes a greater ſurface to the wind.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There have been great changes in the pitch of roofs : our forefathers made them very high, and we make&nbsp;them very low. It does not, however, appear, that this&nbsp;change has been altogether the effect of principle. In&nbsp;the ſimple unadorned habitations of private perſons,&nbsp;every thing conies to be adjuſted by an experience of&nbsp;inconveniences which have reſulted from too low pitched rcofs ; and their pitch will always be nearly ſuch as&nbsp;ſuits the climate änd covering. Our architects, however, go to work oh different principles. Their pro-feſſed aim is to make a beautiful object. The ſources&nbsp;of the pleaſures ariſing from what we call </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">tafle</span><span class="font0"> are ſo&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">various, ſo complicated, </span><span class="font0">and even ſo whimſical, that it</span></p>
