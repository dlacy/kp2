                <p><label>SARDHANA</label>, a town of British India, in Meerut district of the
                    United Provinces, 12 m. by rail N.W. of Meerut. Pop. (1901), 12,467. Though now
                    a decayed place, Sardhana is historically famous as the residence of the Begum
                    Samru (d. 1836). This extraordinary woman was a Mussulman married to Reinhardt
                    or Sombre (Samru), the perpetrator of the massacre of British prisoners at Patna
                    in 1763. On his death in 1778 she succeeded to the command of his mercenary
                    troops. Ultimately she was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church, and
                    bequeathed an immense fortune to charitable and religious uses. She built in
                    Sardhana a Roman Catholic cathedral, a college for training priests, and a
                    handsome palace.</p>
