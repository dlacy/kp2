This disregard of responsibility was partly punished by the use his&nbsp;critics made of it when he became celebrated as a writer&nbsp;on education and a preacher of the domestic affections.&nbsp;Diderot, with whom he became more and more familiar,&nbsp;admitted him as a contributor to the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopédie.</span><span class="font2"> He&nbsp;formed new musical projects, and he was introduced by&nbsp;degrees to many people of rank and influence, among&nbsp;whom his warmest patron for a time was Madame&nbsp;d’Épinay. It was not, however, till 1749 that Rousseau&nbsp;made his mark. The academy of Dijon offered a prize for&nbsp;an essay on the effect of the progress of civilization on&nbsp;morals. Rousseau took up the subject, developed his&nbsp;famous paradox of the superiority of the savage state, won&nbsp;the prize, and, publishing his essay next year, became&nbsp;famous. The anecdotage as to the origin of this famous&nbsp;essay is voluminous. It is agreed that the idea was&nbsp;suggested when Rousseau went to pay a visit to Diderot,&nbsp;who was in prison at Vincennes for his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lettre sur les&nbsp;Aveugles.</span><span class="font2"> Rousseau says he thought of the paradox on his&nbsp;way down ; Morellet and others say that he thought of&nbsp;treating the subject in the ordinary fashion and was&nbsp;laughed at by Diderot, who showed him the advantages of&nbsp;the less obvious treatment. Diderot himself, who in such&nbsp;matters is almost absolutely trustworthy, does not claim&nbsp;the suggestion, but uses words which imply that it was at&nbsp;least partly his. It is very like him. The essay, however,&nbsp;took the artificial and crotchety society of the day by&nbsp;storm. Francueil gave Rousseau a valuable post as cashier&nbsp;in the receiver general’s office. But he resigned it either&nbsp;from conscientiousness, or crotchet, or nervousness at&nbsp;responsibility, or indolence, or more probably from a&nbsp;mixture of all four. He went back to his music copying,&nbsp;but the salons of the day were determined to have his&nbsp;society, and for a time they had it.

He received a hundred louis for it,&nbsp;and he was ordered to come to court next day. This&nbsp;meant the certainty of a pension. But Rousseau’s shyness&nbsp;or his perversity (as before, probably both) made him&nbsp;disobey the command. His comedy </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Narcisse,</span><span class="font2"> written long&nbsp;before, was also acted, but unsuccessfully.

<p><span class="font1"><sup>@@@1</sup> Rousseau’s influence on French music was greater than might have been expected from his very imperfect education ; in truth, he was a&nbsp;musician by natural instinct only, but his feeling for art was very&nbsp;strong, and, though capricious, based upon true perceptions of the&nbsp;good and beautiful.

<p><span class="font2">year with him, the Dijon academy, which had founded his fame, announced the subject of “The Origin of Inequality,” on which he wrote a discourse which was unsuccessful, but at least equal to the former in merit.&nbsp;During a visit to Geneva in 1754 Rousseau saw his old&nbsp;friend and love Madame de Warens (now reduced in circumstances and having lost all her charms), while after&nbsp;abjuring his abjuration of Protestantism he was enabled&nbsp;to take up his freedom as citizen of Geneva, to which his&nbsp;birth entitled him and of which he was proud. Some time&nbsp;afterwards, returning to Paris, he accepted a cottage near&nbsp;Montmorency (the celebrated Hermitage) which Madame&nbsp;d’Épinay had fitted up for him, and established himself there in April 1756. He spent little more than a&nbsp;year there, but it was a very important year. Here&nbsp;he wrote </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">La Nouvelle Heldise</span><span class="font2"> ; here he indulged in the&nbsp;passion which that novel partly represents, his love for&nbsp;Madame d’Houdetot, sister-in-law of Madame d’Épinay, a&nbsp;lady still young and extremely amiable but very plain,&nbsp;who had a husband and a lover (St Lambert), and whom&nbsp;Rousseau’s burning devotion seems to have partly pleased&nbsp;and partly annoyed. Here too arose the incomprehensible&nbsp;triangular quarrel between Diderot, Rousseau, and Grimm&nbsp;which ended Rousseau’s sojourn at the Hermitage. It is&nbsp;impossible to discuss this at length here. The supposition&nbsp;least favourable to Rousseau is that it was due to one of&nbsp;his numerous fits of half-insane petulance and indignation&nbsp;at the obligations which he was nevertheless always ready&nbsp;to incur. That most favourable to him is that he was&nbsp;expected to lend himself in a more or less complaisant&nbsp;manner to assist and cover Madame d’Épinay’s adulterous&nbsp;affection for Grimm. It need only be said that Madame&nbsp;d’Épinay’s morals and Rousseau’s temper are equally&nbsp;indefensible by anyone who knows anything about either,&nbsp;but that the evidence as to the exact influence of both&nbsp;on this particular transaction is hopelessly inconclusive.&nbsp;Diderot seems to have been guilty of nothing but thoughtlessness (if of that) in lending himself to a scheme of the&nbsp;Le Vasseurs, mother and daughter, for getting Rousseau&nbsp;out of the solitude of the Hermitage. At any rate Rousseau quitted the Hermitage in the winter, and established&nbsp;himself at Montlouis in the neighbourhood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Hitherto Rousseau’s behaviour had frequently made him enemies, but his writings had for the most part made him&nbsp;friends. The quarrel with Madame d’Épinay, with Diderot,&nbsp;and through them with the philosophe party reversed this.&nbsp;In 1758 appeared his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Lettre à d’Alembert contre les Spectacles,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">written in the winter of the previous year at Montlouis.&nbsp;This was at once an attack on Voltaire, who was giving&nbsp;theatrical representations at Les Délices, on D’Alembert,&nbsp;who had condemned the prejudice against the stage in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopedic,</span><span class="font2"> and on one of the favourite amusements of the society of the day. Diderot personally&nbsp;would have been forgiving enough. But Voltaire’s strong&nbsp;point was not forgiveness, and, though Rousseau no&nbsp;doubt exaggerated the efforts of his “enemies,” he&nbsp;was certainly henceforward as obnoxious to the philo-</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
