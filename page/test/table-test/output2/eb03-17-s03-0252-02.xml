(Nicanor), one oſ the chief generals under Alexander the Great, and, aſter his death, founder of the race of princes called <hi rend="italic">Seleucidæ.</hi> He is equally celebrated as a renowned warrior, and as the father of his people ; yet his virtues could not protect him from the fatal ambition of Ceraunus, one of his courtiers, by whom he was aſſaſſinated 280 B. C.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">SELF-Heal,</hi> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Prunella Vulgaris</hi> of Linnaeus. The ſtem is erect, and about eight or ten inches high. The leaves grow on foot ſtalks, are ovato-oblong, ſlightly indented, and ſomewhat hairy. The bracteae are heart-ſhaped, oppoſite, and fringed. The flowers are white or purpliſh, grow in denſe ſpikes, and are terminal. This plant is perennial, grows wild in meadows and paſture grounds, and flowers in June and July.</p><p>This herb is recommended as a mild reſtringent and vulnerary in ſpittings of blood, and other hemorrhagies and fluxes ; and in gargarisms againſt aphthae and inflammations of the fauces. Its virtues do not appear to be very great ; to the taſte it diſcovers a very slight auſterity or bitteriſhneſs, which is more ſensible in the flowery tops than in the leaves, though the latter are generally directed for medicinal uſe.</p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Self-</hi> <hi rend="italic">Command,</hi> is that ſteady equanimity which enables a man in every ſituation to exert his reaſoning faculty with coolneſs, and to do what the preſent circumſtances require. It depends much upon the natural temperament of the body, and much upon the moral cultivation of the mind. He who enjoys good health, and has braced his frame by exerciſe, has always a greater command of himſelf than a man of equal mental powers, who has ſuffered his conſtitution to become relaxed by indolence ; and he who has from his early youth been accuſtomed to make his paſſions ſubmit to his reaſon, muſt, in any ſudden emergency, be more capable of acting properly than he who has tamely yielded to his paſſion. Hence it is that recluſe and literary men, when forced into the buſtle of public life, are incapable of acting where promptneſs is requiſite ; and that men who have once or twice yielded to a senſe of impending danger ſeldom acquire afterwards that command of themſelves which may be neceſſary to extricate them from ſubſequent dangers In one of the earlieſt battles fought by the late king of Pruſſia, the ſovereign was among the first men who quitted the field :</p><p>had he behaved in the ſame manner a second and a third time, he would never have become that hero whose actions aſtoniſhed Europe. A celebrated engineer among ourſelves, who was well known to the writer of this ſhort article, had little ſcience, and was a ſtranger to the principles of his own art ; but being poſſeſſed of a firm and vigorous frame, and having been accuſtomed to ſtruggle with dangers and difficulties, he had ſuch a conſtant command of himſelf, as enabled him to employ with great coolneſs every neceſſary reſource in the day of battle.</p><p>But it is not only in battle, and in the face of immediate danger, that ſelf-command is necessary to enable a man to act with propriety. There is no ſituation in life where difficulties, greater or less, are not to be encountered ; and he who would paſs through life with comfort to himſelf, and with utility to the public, muſt endeavour to keep his paſſions in conſtant ſubjection to his reaſon. No man can enjoy without inquietude wſhat he cannot loſe without pain ; and no man who is overwhelmed with deſpondency under any ſudden misfortune can exert the talents neceſſary to retrieve his circumilances. We ought, therefore, by every means to endeavour to obtain a conſtant command of ourselves ; and nowhere ſhall we find better leſſons for this purpoſe than in ancient Lacedemon. There certain occupations were appointed for each ſex, for every hour, and for every seaſon of life. In a life always active, the passions have no opportunity to deceive, ſeduce, or corrupt ; and the nervous ſyſtem acquires a firmneſs which makes it a fit inſtrument to a vigorous mind.</p><p><hi rend="italic">SELF-Defence</hi> implies not only the preservation of one’s life, but alſo the protection of his property, becauſe without property life cannot be preserved in a civilized nation. The extent of property esſential to life is indeed small, and this conſideration may enable us to decide a queſtion which some moraliſts have made intricate. By what means, it has been aſked, may a man protect his property ? May he kill the perſon who attacks it, if he cannot otherwiſe repel the attack ?</p><p>That a man, in the ſtate of nature, may kill the perſon who makes an attack on his life, if he cannot otherwiſe repel the attack, is a truth which has never been controverted ; and he may do the same in civil society, if his danger be ſo imminent that it cannot be exerted by the interpoſition of the protection provided for individuals by the state. In all poſſible ſituations, except the three following, whatever is absolutely neceſſary to the preſervation of life may be lawfully performed, for the law of self-preſervation is the firſt and moſt ſacred of thoſe laws which are impreſſed upon every mind by the author of nature.</p><p>The three excepted ſituations are thoſe of a ſoldier in the day of battle, of a criminal about to ſuffer by the laws of his country, and of a man called upon to renounce his religion. The ſoldier hazards his life in the moſt honourable of all causes, and cannot betray his truſt, or play the coward, without incurring a high degree of moral turpitude. He knows that the very profeſſion in which he is engaged necessarily ſubjects him to danger ; and he voluntarily incurred that danger lor the good of his country, which, with great propriety, annexes to his profeſſion peculiar privileges and much glory. The criminal under sentence of death cannot, without adding to his guilt, reſist the execution of that<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0259.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0253"/>
sentence ; for the power of inflicting puniſhment is esſential to ſociety, and ſociety is the ordinance of God, (see <hi rend="smallcaps">Society).</hi> The man who is called upon to renounce his religion ought to ſubmit to the cruelleſt death rather than comply with that requeſt, ſince religion is his only ſecurity for future and permanent happineſs. But in every other ſituation, that which is abſolutely neceſſary to the preſervation of life is undoubtedly lawful. Hence it is, that a perſon sinking in water is never thought to be guilty of any crime, though he drag his neighbour after him by his endeavours to ſave himſelf; and hence, too, a man in danger of periſhing by ſhipwreck may drive another from a plank which cannot carry them both, for ſince one of two lives muſt be lost, no law, human or divine, calls upon either of them to prefer his neighbour’s life to his own.</p><p>But though the rights of ſelf-defence authoriſe us to repel every attack made upon our life, and in cases of extremity to save ourſelves at the expence of the life of our innocent neighbour, it is not ſo evident that, rather than give to an unjuſt demand a few ſhillings or pounds, we may lawfully deprive a fellow creature of life, and the public of a citizen. A few pounds loſt may be eaſily regained ; but life wſhen loſt can never be recovered. If theſe pounds, indeed, be the whole of a man’s property; if they include his clothes, his food, and the houſe where he ſhelters his head—there cannot be a doubt but that, rather than part with them, he may lawfully kill the aggreſſor, for no man can exiſt without ſhelter, food, and raiment. But it is ſeldom that an attempt is made, or is indeed practicable, to rob a man at once of all that he poſſeſſes. The queſtion then of any importance is, May a man put a robber to death rather than part with a small part of his property ? Mr Paley doubts whether he could innocently do ſo in a ſtate of nature, “ becauſe it cannot be contended to be for the augmentation of human happineſs, that one man ſhould loſe his life or limb, rather than another a pennyworth of his property.” He allows, that in civil ſociety the life of the aggreſſor may be always taken away by the perſon aggrieved, or meant to be aggrieved, when the crime attempted is ſuch as</p><p>would ſubject its perpetrator to death by the laws oſ his country.</p><p>It is not often that we feel ourſelves diſpoſed to differ in opinion from this moſt valuable and intelligent writer ; but on the preſent occaſion we cannot help thinking that he does not reaſon with his uſual preciſion. To us he even ſeems to loſe fight of his own principles. No legiſlature can have a right to take away life in civil ſociety, but in ſuch caſes as individuals have the same right in a ſtate of nature. If therefore a man, in the ſtate of nature, have not a right to protect his property by killing the aggreſſor, when it cannot be otherwiſe protected, it appears to us ſelf-evident that no legiſlature can have a right to inflict the puniſhment of death upon ſuch offences ; but if the laws inflicting death upon the crime oſ robbery be morally evil, it is certain that an individual cannot be innocent when he prevents robbery by the death of the robber, merely becauſe he knows that the laws of his country have decreed that puniſhment againſt thoſe convicted of that crime. But we think that the protection of property by the death of the aggreſſor may be completely vindicated upon more general principles. It is neceſſary, in every ſtate, that property be protected, or mankind could not subſiſt ; but in a ſtate of nature every man muſt be the defender of his own property, which in that ſtate muſt neceſſarily be ſmall : and if he be not allowed to defend it by every mean in his power, he will not long be able to protect it at all. By giving him ſuch liberty, a few individuals may, indeed, occaſionally loſe their lives and limbs for the preſervation of a very ſmall portion of private property ; but we believe that the ſum of human happineſs will be more augmented by cutting off ſuch worthleſs wretches than by expoſing property to perpetual depredation ; and therefore, if general utility be the criterion of moral good, we muſt be of opinion that a man may in every case lawfully kill a robber rather than comply with his unjuſt demand.</p><p>But if a man may without guilt preſerve his property by the death of the aggressor, when it cannot be preſerved by any other means, much more may a woman have recourſe to the laſt extremity to protect her chaſtity from forcible violation. This, indeed, is admitted by Mr Paley himſelf, and will be controverted by no man who reflects on the importance of the female character, and the probable conſequences oſ the ſmalleſt deviation from the eſtabliſhed laws of female honour. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Seduction.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">SELF-Knowledge,</hi> the knowledge of one’s own character, abilities, opinions, virtues, and vices. This has always been conſidered as a difficult though important aequiſition. It is difficult, becauſe it is diſagreeable to investigate our errors, our faults, and vices ; becauſe we are apt to be partial to ourſelves, even when we have done wrong ; and becauſe time and habitual attention are requiſite to enable us to diſcover our real character. But theſe difficulties are more than counterbalanced by the advantages of ſelf-knowledge.</p><p>By knowing the extent of our abilities, we ſhall never raſhly engage in enterpriſes where our ineffectual exertions may be productive of harm : by inveſtigating our opinions, we may diſcover thoſe which have no foundation, and thoſe alſo which lead us inſenſibly into vice. By examining our virtues and vices, we ſhall learn what principles ought to be strengthened, and what habits ought to be removed.</p><p>Man is a rational and intelligent being, capable of great improvement, and liable to great vices. If he acta without examining his principles, he may be hurried by blind passion into crimes. If he aſpires at noble and valuable acquiſitions, he muſt act upon a plan, with deliberation and fore-thought ; for he is not like a vegetable, which attains perfection by the influence of external causes : he has powers within himſelf which muſt be exerted, and exerted with judgment, in order to attain the perfection of his nature. To enable him to employ theſe powers aright, he muſt know, ſirſt, what is his duty; and, ſecondly, he muſt often review his principles and conduct, that he may diſcover whether he is performing his duty, or in what circumſtances he has failed. When he finds that he has fallen into error and vice, he will naturally inquire what cauſes have produced this effect, that he may avoid the same for the time to come. This is the method by which every reformation in religion and ſcience has been produced, and the method by which the arts have been improved. Before Lord Bacon introduced the new way of philoſophizing, he must firſt have conſidered wherein true philosophy conſisted ; ſecondly, he muſt have inquired<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0260.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0254"/>
in what reſpects the ancient method of philoſophizing was falſe or uſeleſs : and after determining these two points, he was qualified to deſcribe the way by which the ſtudy of philosophy could be ſucceſsfully purſued without deviating into hypotheſis and error. Luther found out the errors of the church of Rome by comparing their doctrines with the Scriptures. But had this compariſon never been made, the reformation could never have taken place. Without ſelf-knowledge, or without that knowledge of our character which is derived from a compariſon of our principles and conduct with a perfect ſtandard of morality, we can never form plans and reſolutions, or make any exertion to abandon the vicious habits which we have contracted, and ſtrengthen thoſe virtuous principles in which we are deficient.</p><p>As much may be learned from the errors of thoſe who have been in ſimilar ſituations with ourſelves ; ſo many uſeſul cautions may be obtained from our own errors ; and he that will remember theſe, will ſeldom be twice guilty of the ſame vice.</p><p>it was evidently the intention of Providence that man ſhould be guided chiefly by experience. It is by the obſervations which we make on what we see paſſing around us, or from what we ſuffer in our own perſon, that we form maxims for the conduct of life. The more minutely therefore we attend to our principles, and the more maxims we form, we ſhall be the better fitted to attain moral perfection.</p><p>With reſpect to our underſtanding, to mark the errors which we have fallen into, either by its natural defects or by negligence, is alſo of great importance ; for the greateſt genius and moſt profound ſcholar are liable to theſe errors, and often commit them as well as the weak and illiterate. But by obſerving them, and tracing them to their cauſes, they at length acquire an habitual accuracy. It is true, that men of feeble minds can never by knowing their own defects exalt themſelves to the rank of genius ; but ſuch knowledge will enable them to improve their underſtandings, and ſo to appreciate their own powers, as ſeldom to attempt what is beyond their ſtrength. They may thus become uſeful members of ſociety ; and though they will not probably be admired for their abilities, they will yet eſcape the ridicule which is poured upon vanity.</p><p>It is difficult to lay down preciſe rules for the acquisition of this ſelf-knowledge, becauſe almoſt every man is blinded by a fallacy peculiar to himſelf. But when one has got rid of that partiality which ariſes from ſelf- love, he may eaſily form a juſt eſtimate of his moral improvements, by comparing the general courſe of his conduct with the ſtandard of his duty ; and if he has any doubt of the extent of his intellectual attainments, he will moſt readily diſcover the truth by comparing them with the attainments of others who have been moſt ſucceſsful in the ſame pursuits. Should vanity ariſe in his mind from ſuch a compariſon, let him then compare the extent of his knowledge with what is yet to be known, and he will then be in little danger of thinking of himſelf more highly than he ought to think. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Prejudice</hi> and <hi rend="italic">SELF-Partiality.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">SELF-Love,</hi> is that inſtinctive principle which impels every animal, rational and irrational, to preſerve its life and promote its own happineſs. It is very generally confounded with ſelfishness ; but we think that the one propenſity is distinct from the other. Every man loves him</p><p>ſelf ; but every man is not ſelfiſh. The ſelfiſh man graſps at all <hi rend="italic">immediate</hi> advantages, regardleſs of the consequences which his conduct may have upon his neighbour. Self-love only prompts him who is actuated by it to procure to himſelf the greateſt poſſible ſum of happineſs during the whole of his exiſtence. In this purſuit the rational ſelf-lover will often forego a preſent enjoyment to obtain a greater and more permanent one in reverſion ; and he will as often ſubmit to a preſent pain to avoid a greater hereafter. Self-love, as diſtinguiſhed from ſelfiſhneſs, always comprehends the whole of a man’s exiſtence, and in that extended ſenſe of the phraſe, we heſitate not to ſay that every man is a ſelf- lover ; for, with eternity in his view, it is ſurely not poſſible for the moſt diſintereſted of the human race not to prefer himſelf to all other men, if their future and everlaſting intereſts could come into competition. This indeed they never can do ; for though the introduction of evil into the world, and the different ranks which it makes neceſſary in ſociety, put it in the power of a man to raiſe himſelf, in the preſent ſtate, by the depreſſion of his neighbour, or by the practice of injuſtice, yet in the purſuit of a prize which is to be gained only by soberneſs, righteouſneſs, and piety, there can be no rivalſhip among the different competitors. The ſucceſs of one is no injury to another ; and therefore, in this ſenſe of the phraſe, ſelf-love is not only lawful, but abſolutely unavoidable. It has been a queſtion in morals, whether it be not likewiſe the incentive to every action, however virtuous or apparently diſintereſted ?</p><p>Thoſe who maintain the affirmative side of this queſtion ſay, that the proſpect of immediate pleaſure, or the dread of immediate pain, is the only apparent motive to action in the minds of infants, and indeed of all who look not before them, and infer the future from the past. They own, that when a boy has had ſome experience, and is capable of making comparisons, he will often decline an immediate enjoyment which he has formerly found productive of future evil more than equivalent to all its good ; but in doing ſo they think, and they think juſtly, that he is ſtill actuated by the principle of ſelf-love, purſuing the greateſt good of which he knows himſelf to be capable. After experiencing that truth, equity, and benevolence in all his dealings is the readieſt, and indeed the only certain, method of ſecuring to himſelf the kindneſs and good offices of his fellow-creatures, and much more when he has learned that they will recommend him to the Supreme Being, upon whom depends his exiſtence and all his enjoyments, they admit that he will practice truth, equity, and benevolence; but ſtill, from the ſame principle, purſuing his own ultimate happineſs as the object which he has always in view. The proſpect of this great object will make him feel an exquiſite pleaſure in the performance of the actions which he conceives as neceſſary to its attainment, till at laſt, without attending in each inſtance to their conſequences, he will, by the great aſſociating principle which has been explained elsewhere (ſee <hi rend="smallcaps">Metaphysics,</hi> part 1st, chap, 1.) feel a refined enjoyment in the actions themſelves, and perform them, as occaſions offer, without deliberation or reflection. Such, they think, is the origin of benevolence itlelf, and indeed of every virtue.</p><p>Thoſe who take the other side of the queſtion, can hardly deny that ſelf-love thus modified may prompt to<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0261.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0255"/>
virtuous and apparently diſintereſted conduct ; but they think it degrading the dignity of man to ſuppoſe him actuated ſolely by motives which can be traced back to a deſire of his own happineſs. They obſerve, that the Author of our nature has not left the preſervation of the individual, or the continuance of the ſpecies, to the deductions of our reaſon, computing the ſum of happineſs which the actions neceſſary to theſe ends produce to ourſelves : on the contrary, He has taken care of both, by the surer impulſe of inſtinct planted in us for theſe very purpoſes. And is it conceivable, say they, that He would leave the care of our fellow-creatures a matter of indifference, till each man ſhould be able to diſcover or be taught that by loving his neighbour, and doing him all the good in his power, he would be moſt effectually promoting his own happineſs ? It is diſhonouring virtue, they continue, to make it proceed in any instance from a proſpect of happineſs, or a dread of miſery ; and they appeal from theory to fact, as exhibited in the conduct of ſavage tribes, who deliberate little on the conſequences of their actions.</p><p>Their antagoniſts reply, that the conduct of ſavage tribes is to be conſidered as that of children in civilized nations, regulated entirely by the examples which they have before them ; that their actions cannot be the offspring of innate inſtincts, otherwise ſavage virtues would, under ſimilar circumſtances, everywhere be the same, which is contrary to fact ; that virtue proceeds from an intereſted motive on either ſuppoſition ; and that the motive which the inſtinctive ſcheme holds up is the moſt ſelfiſh of the two. The other theory ſuppoſes, that the governing motive is the hope of <hi rend="italic">future</hi> happineſs and the dread of <hi rend="italic">future</hi> miſery ; the inſtinctive ſcheme ſupply a <hi rend="italic">present</hi> motive in the self-complacency ariſing in the heart from a conſciouſneſs of right conduct. The former is a rational motive, the latter has nothing more to do with reaſon than the enjoyment ariſing from eating or drinking, or from the intercourſe between the ſexes. But we mean not to purſue the ſubject farther, as we have ſaid enough on it in the articles <hi rend="smallcaps">Benevolence, Instinct, Passion,</hi> and <hi rend="smallcaps">Philanthropy.</hi> We ſhall therefore conclude with observing, that there is certainly a virtuous as well as a vicious ſelſ-love, and that “ true ſelf-love and ſocial are the ſame.”</p><p><hi rend="italic">SELF-Murder.</hi> See <hi rend="smallcaps">Suicide.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic smallcaps"> Self-</hi> <hi rend="italic">Partiality,</hi> is a phraſe employed by ſome philosophers<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>[m]* See Lord Kaimes's Art of Thinking.</p></note> * to expreſs that weakneſs of human nature through which men overvalue themſelves when compared with others. It is distinguiſhed from general partiality, by thoſe who make use of the expreſſion, becauſe it is thought that a man is led to over-rate his own accompliſhments, either by a particular inſtinct, or by a proceſs of intellect different from that by which he over-rates the accompliſhments of his friends or children. 3 he former kind of partiality is wholly ſelfiſh ; the latter partakes much of benevolence.</p><p>This diſtinction may perhaps be deemed plauſible by thoſe who conſider the human mind as little more than a bundle of inſtincts ; but it must appear perfectly ridiculous to ſuch as reſolve the greater part of apparent inſtincts into early and deep-rooted associations of ideas. If the partialities which moſt men have to their friends, their families, and themſelves, be inſtinctive, they are certainly inſtincts of different kinds ; but an inſtinctive partiality is a contradiction in terms. Partiality is founded on a compariſon between two or more objects; but genuine inſtincts form no companions. See <hi rend="smallcaps">Instinct. No</hi> man can be ſaid to be partial to the late Dr Johnſon, merely for thinking highly of his intellectual-powers; nor was the Doctor partial to himſelf, tho’ he thought in this reſpect with the generality of his countrymen ; but if, upon a compariſon with Milton, he was deemed the greater poet of the two, ſuch a judgment will be allowed to be partial, whether formed by himſelf or by any of his admirers. We apprehend, however, that the proceſs of its formation, was the ſame in every mind by which it was held.</p><p>The origin of ſelf-partiality is not difficult to be found ; and our partialities to our friends may be traced to a ſimilar ſource. By the conſtitution of our nature we are impelled to ſhun pain and to purſue pleaſure ; but rernorſe, the ſevereſt of all pains, is the never- failing conſequence of vicious conduct. Remorſe ariſes from the dread of that puniſhment which we believe will in a future ſtate be inflicted on vice unrepented of in this ; and therefore every vicious perſon endeavours by all poſſible means to baniſh that dread from his own mind. One way of effecting this is to compare his own life with the lives of others ; for he fancies that if numbers be as wicked as himſelf, the benevolent Lord of all things will not involve them in one common ruin. Hence, by magnifying to himſelf the temptations which led him astray, and diminiſhing the injuries which his conduct has done in the world, and by adopting a courſe diametrically the reverſe, when estimating the morality or immorality of the conduct of lus neighbours, he ſoon comes to believe that he is at least not more wicked than they. Thus is ſelf-partiality formed in the mind, and quickly blinds him who is under its influence ſo completely, as to hide from him the very faults which he sees and blames in others. Hence the coward thinks himſelf only cautious, the miſer frugal. Partiality is formed in the very ſame manner to natural or acquired accompliſhments, whether mental or corporeal. Theſe always procure reſpect to him who is poſſeſsed of them ; and as respect is accompanied with many advantages, every man wiſhes to obtain it for himſelf. If he fail in his attempts, he conſoles himſelf with the perſuaſion that it is at leaſt due to his merits, and that it is only withheld by the envy of the public. He compares the particular branch of ſcience or bodily accompliſhment in which he himſelf moſt excels, with thoſe which have conferred ſplendor on his rival ; and easily finds that his own excellencies are of the higheſt order, and entitled to the greateſt ſhare of public eſteem. Hence the polite ſcholar deſpiſes the mathematician ; the reader of Ariſtotle and Plato all the modern diſcoveries in physical and moral ſcience ; and the mere experimentaliſt holds in the moſt sovereign contempt a critical knowledge of the ancient languages. The pupil of the ancients denies the merits of the moderns, whilſt the mere modern allows nothing to the ancients ; and thus each becomes partial to his own acquisitions, and of courſe to himſelf, for having been at the trouble to make them.</p><p>Partiality to our friends and families is generated in the very ſame way. Whenever we acquire ſuch an af-<pb facs="gri_33125011196363_0262.tif" xml:id="eb03-17-s03-0256"/>
fection for them as to conſider their happineſs as adding to our own (ſee Passion), we magnify their excellencies, and diminiſh their defects, for the ſame reason, and by the ſame proceſs, that we magnify and diminiſh our own. All partialities, however, are prejudices, and prejudices of the worst kind. They ought therefore to be guarded againſt with the utmoſt care, by the ſame means which we have elſewhere recommended (ſee Prejudice and Metaphysics, n⁰ 98.); and he who is partial to his own virtue or his own knowledge, will do well to compare the former, not with the conduct of his neighbour, but with the expreſs rule of his duty ; and to conſider the latter as no farther valuable than as it contributes to the ſum of human happiness.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
