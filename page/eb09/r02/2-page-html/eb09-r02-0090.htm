<p><span class="font1">boundary on the east. The department belongs almost entirely to the basin of the Rhone, to which it sends its&nbsp;waters by the Saône and its tributary the Azergues, and&nbsp;by the Gier. The watershed between the Rhone and the&nbsp;Loire rises to the west of the department, and from north&nbsp;to south forms four successive groups—the Beaujolais&nbsp;Mountains, the highest peak of which is 3320 feet; the&nbsp;Tarare group ; the Lyonnais Mountains (nearly 3000 feet) ;&nbsp;and Mont Pilat, the highest peak of which belongs to the&nbsp;department of Loire. The lowest point of the department,&nbsp;where it is left by the Rhone, is 460 feet above the level&nbsp;of the sea. The meteorological conditions vary greatly&nbsp;with the elevation and exposure. Snow sometimes lies in&nbsp;the mountains from November to April, whilst at Lyons&nbsp;and in the valleys the mean temperature in winter is 36°&nbsp;Fahr., and in summer 70°, the annual mean being 53°.&nbsp;The average rainfall is somewhat higher than is general&nbsp;over France owing to the amount of the precipitation on&nbsp;the hilly region.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Of a total area of 689,545 acres, 286,000 are arable, 120,000 are pasture meadow land, 79,000 under vines, 79,000 wood, and 66,000&nbsp;moorland. From 1874 to 1883 the average annual harvests&nbsp;yielded 253,869 quarters of wheat, 7509 of meslin, 114,468 of rye,&nbsp;3035 of barley, and 98,803 of oats. In 1883 there were produced 5,390,000 bushels of potatoes, 106,650 bushels of buckwheat, 41,320 tons of beetroot, 12 of hemp seed, and 83 of hemp.&nbsp;Between 1874 and 1883 the average annual yield of the vines was&nbsp;16,533,956 gallons of wine; in 1883 it was only 11,918,084. In&nbsp;1881 the live stock numbered 12,350 horses, 2000 asses, 600 mules,&nbsp;9000 oxen or bulls, 65,000 cows, 12,500 calves, 49,000 sheep (producing 110 tons of wool), 16,000 pigs, 36,000 goats, 8000 beehives (producing 48 tons of honey and 16 tons of wax); 78 cwts.&nbsp;of cocoons were produced in 1882, while in 1883 there were only 47&nbsp;cwts. The soil of the department is for the most part stony and&nbsp;only moderately fertile. Fruit trees, such as peaches, apricots,&nbsp;walnuts, and chestnuts, grow well, but the wood in general is little&nbsp;more than copse and brushwood. The wealth of the department is&nbsp;mainly derived from its industries. Its transactions with the Bank&nbsp;of France at Lyons in 1882 amounted to £30,398,960—a figure&nbsp;only exceeded by the departments Seine and Nord. The population is principally engaged in the manufacture of chemicals,&nbsp;of machinery, and of silk. In 1881 324 factories, with 18,500&nbsp;spindles, 700 power-looms, and 43,000 hand-looms, were employed&nbsp;in the spinning and weaving of silk; 58 works, with 35,800 hackling and reeling machines, in the preparation of the raw&nbsp;material ; 7 works, with 450 spindles, 230 power-looms, and 1250&nbsp;hand-looms, in the manufacture of mixed goods, and 800 looms in&nbsp;the manufacture of lace ; 80 dyeworks employ 4000 workmen. In&nbsp;1879 it was calculated that the turnover for silk articles amounted&nbsp;to £15,000,000 (£5,000,000 for labour and £10,000,000 for the raw&nbsp;material). Lyons (R.v.') is the centre for the silk manufacture and&nbsp;Tarare for that of muslins, velvets, plush, calicoes, and prints, there&nbsp;being 26 factories, with 33,000 spindles, 540 power-looms, 4800 hand-looms ; 2000 workmen are also employed in the manufacture of&nbsp;counterpanes. In 1882 88,115 tons of iron were produced. The&nbsp;chief workshops for repairing the locomotivesof the Paris, Lyons, and&nbsp;Mediterranean line are in this department. There are also foundries&nbsp;of copper, bronze, and bell-metal, as also gold, silver, and steel wire&nbsp;works. The manufacture of gold and silver plate and jewellery has&nbsp;an annual turnover of £320,000, that of edible pastes amounts to&nbsp;£480,000, and that of paper to £54,000. The manufacture of&nbsp;wall papers is only second to that of Paris. In addition there are&nbsp;15 chemical works, 8 glass works employing 1000 workmen with a&nbsp;turnover of £190,000 in 1879, 9 candle works (£268,800), 12 soap&nbsp;works (£102,200), and 700 mills. In 1881 there were in the&nbsp;department 1448 industrial establishments, employing 1558 steam&nbsp;engines with an aggregate horse power of 13,077. Coal and&nbsp;anthracite are found (36,169 tons in 1882), as well as argentiferous&nbsp;lead, manganese, and copper pyrites ; there are also large stone&nbsp;quarries. The cold mineral spring of Charbonnière, containing&nbsp;bicarbonates, iron, and sulphur, is 19 miles west of Lyons. The&nbsp;means of communication include 76 miles of navigable river, 5 of&nbsp;canal (the canal of Givors), 141 miles of Government road, 3685&nbsp;miles of other roads, and 165 miles of railway connecting, Lyons&nbsp;with Paris, with Roanne by Tarare, with Montbrison, St Étienne,&nbsp;Nîmes, Marseilles, Grenoble, Chambéry, Geneva, Bourg, and&nbsp;Trévoux, Beaujeu with Belleville (on the Lyons and Mâcon line),&nbsp;and Thizy with Cours (two manufacturing towns in the neighbourhood of Tarare on the line from Lyons to Roanne). The population, which owing to the development of industries has doubled&nbsp;since 1801, was 741,470 in 1881—266 per square kilometre, the&nbsp;average in France being 71. There are two arrondissements, Lyons&nbsp;and Villefranche, 29 cantons, and 264 communes. Rhône belongs&nbsp;to the diocese of Lyons, is under the jurisdiction of the superior&nbsp;court of Lyons, and is divided between the corps d’armée of&nbsp;Clermont and of Grenoble. The chief towns are Lyons (g.vO;&nbsp;Tarare (13,352); Villeurbane (11,176); Caluire-et-Cuire (9740)&nbsp;and Oullins (7536), suburbs of Lyons; Givors (11,470), a stirring&nbsp;town on the Rhone at the junction of the canal by which coal is&nbsp;brought from St Etienne to the Rhone, with glass works, blast&nbsp;furnaces, foundries, brick and tile works, and potteries ; Amplepius&nbsp;(7118) ; and Cours (6929).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RHUBARB. This name is applied both to a drug and to a vegetable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">1. The drug has been used in medicine from very early&nbsp;times, being described in the Chinese herbal </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Pen-king,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">which is believed to date from 2700 b.c. The name seems&nbsp;to be a corruption of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum barbarum</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Reu barbarum,</span><span class="font1"> a&nbsp;designation applied to the drug as early as the middle of the&nbsp;6th century, and apparently identical with the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">pηov</span><span class="font1"> or pα&nbsp;of Dioscorides, described by him as a root brought from&nbsp;beyond the Bosphorus. Rha is said by Ammianus Mar-cellinus to take its name from the river Rha (Volga), on&nbsp;the banks of which a species of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum (R. Rhαponticum)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">grows. It is not, however, known whether the root of&nbsp;this species was the article used under the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rha&nbsp;ponticum</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rha barbarum,</span><span class="font1"> or whether these names were&nbsp;applied to the drug brought overland from China by way&nbsp;of the Caspian Sea. It is, however, certain that in the&nbsp;early part of the 11th century Chinese rhubarb was distinguished as superior to the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Rha barbarum.</span><span class="font1"> In the&nbsp;14th century rhubarb appears to have found its way to&nbsp;Europe by way of the Indus and Persian Gulf to the Red&nbsp;Sea and Alexandria, and was therefore described as “East&nbsp;Indian ” rhubarb. Some also came by way of Persia and&nbsp;the Caspian to Syria and Asia Minor, and reached Europe&nbsp;from the ports of Aleppo and Smyrna, and became known&nbsp;as “Turkey” rhubarb. Subsequently to the year 1653,&nbsp;when China first permitted Russia to trade on her frontiers, Chinese rhubarb reached Europe chiefly by way of&nbsp;Moscow; and in 1704 the rhubarb trade became a monopoly of the Russian Government, in consequence of which&nbsp;the term “ Russian ” or “ crown ” rhubarb came to be&nbsp;applied to it. Urga was the great depot for the rhubarb&nbsp;trade in 1719, but in 1728 the depot was transferred to&nbsp;Kiachta. All rhubarb brought to the depot passed through&nbsp;the hands of the Government inspector, acting under the&nbsp;instructions of the Russian minister of war, and all pieces&nbsp;except those of good quality were rejected. Hence Russian&nbsp;rhubarb was invariably good and obtained a remarkably&nbsp;high price. This severe supervision naturally led, as&nbsp;soon as the northern Chinese ports were thrown open to&nbsp;European trade, to a new outlet being sought ; and the&nbsp;increased demand for the drug at these ports resulted in&nbsp;less care being exercised by the Chinese in the collection&nbsp;and curing of the root, so that the rhubarb of good quality&nbsp;offered at Kiachta rapidly dwindled in quantity, and after&nbsp;1860 Russian rhubarb ceased to appear in European&nbsp;commerce. The drug from that date became known&nbsp;as Chinese rhubarb, although the older names still continue in domestic use in England. ' Owing to the expense&nbsp;of carrying the drug across the whole breadth of Asia and&nbsp;the difficulty of preserving it from the attacks of insects,&nbsp;rhubarb was formerly one of the most costly of drugs. In&nbsp;1542 it was sold in France for ten times the price of cinnamon and four times that of saffron, and in an English&nbsp;price list bearing date of 1657 it is quoted at 16s. per lb,&nbsp;opium being at that time only 6s. and scammony 12s.&nbsp;per lb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Rhubarb is used in medicine as a mild purgative and cholagogue, promoting digestion and improving the appetite when given in small doses, probably by stimulating&nbsp;the intestinal secretions.
