<p><span class="font0">ance, except some districts within the Persian frontier. Alexander’s gave to Russia in the first years of the present&nbsp;century several of the tribes of the Caucasus ; Finland in&nbsp;1809 ; Daghestan and other large territories ceded by Persia&nbsp;in 1813 ; and in 1814, Napoleon’s grand duchy of Warsaw,&nbsp;which was erected into a kingdom of Poland. The total&nbsp;population of these new Russian provinces cannot at the&nbsp;very least be estimated under fifteen millions, and probably&nbsp;exceeds that number.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the ten years of Alexander’s reign which succeeded the peace, and ended with his death in 1825, he acquired no new territory as a substantive addition to his dominions, but occupied himself assiduously in that indirect augmentation of Russian influence on the states around the&nbsp;frontier, which had before his time formed, and has since&nbsp;continued to form, the first step in all the schemes of conquest projected by his ambitious nation. The objects of&nbsp;Alexander’s foreign policy after 1815 were chiefly three;&nbsp;the suppression of constitutional, or, as they were called by&nbsp;preference, revolutionary movements, in the central and&nbsp;southern states of Europe ; the weakening of Turkey, and&nbsp;the gradual reduction of that power into a state of dependence .on the cabinet of St Petersburg, so as to pave the way&nbsp;for the Russians towards the sovereignty of the Levant ; and&nbsp;the extension of the Russian influence in Persia and those&nbsp;adjacent states, which must form the stepping-stones by&nbsp;which the Muscovites will strive to pass, if they shall ever&nbsp;make the attempt, to the throne of British India. For the&nbsp;attainment of the first of these great ends, there was formed,&nbsp;under the guidance and by the suggestion of Alexander,&nbsp;that league of princes which has been named the Holy Alliance ; a confederacy whose bitter fruits have been tasted&nbsp;in full measure by Italy and Spain, but whose conception&nbsp;is in one view an encouraging tribute to the growing enlightenment of the world, since it is the earliest instance in&nbsp;which despots, conspiring against truth and freedom, have&nbsp;condescended to speak the language of Christianity and&nbsp;peace. In reference to Turkey, the policy of Alexander&nbsp;aimed at gradually detaching the Porte from its friendly relations with Great Britain and other European powers, and&nbsp;insidiously advancing towards a position in which the sultan should find himself powerless against his neighbours and&nbsp;his own subjects, until Russia should stretch forth her protecting hand ; but a check was administered to this train of&nbsp;diplomacy, and a peculiar relation introduced between the&nbsp;courts of Constantinople and St Petersburg, by the insurrection of Greece in 1821. To the founder and head of the&nbsp;Holy Alliance the Greeks must have appeared to be mere&nbsp;rebels, whom it was his duty as a neighbouring sovereign to&nbsp;assist in punishing ; while to the watchful power which desired by every available means to weaken and circumscribe&nbsp;the power of Turkey, such an opportunity as the Greek revolution was unusually tempting, and indeed the sultan’s ministers openly alleged that the disturbances had been fomented&nbsp;by Russian agents. The result of the rising in Greece has&nbsp;been related in our article on that country ; and the other&nbsp;misunderstandings between Russia and Turkey, the principal of which related to the appointment of the hospodars in&nbsp;Wallachia and Moldavia, were not sufficient to disturb the&nbsp;diplomatic system which was resumed after the Greek question had been settled by the interposition of the other great&nbsp;European powers. The designs of the emperor on the side&nbsp;of India chiefly exhibited themselves in intrigues among&nbsp;the northern neighbours of our possessions in that country ;&nbsp;and the system scarcely came to light till after Alexander’s&nbsp;death.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the internal government of the empire, Alexander in-</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;traduced many salutary changes, especially in the early part</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of his reign ; but here, not less than in his foreign policy,&nbsp;the last ten years of his life exhibited a marked contrast&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">to its earlier portion. The transition in his mind from a&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">love of liberal institutions to a distrust of every thing that&nbsp;seemed to threaten the stability of thrones, began almost&nbsp;with his alliance with Napoleon, but reached full maturity&nbsp;after that extraordinary man’s fall. In the first year of his&nbsp;reign he abolished the literary censorship, and afterwards&nbsp;restored it with less absurd but not less severe rules than&nbsp;those of his father. He at one time patronized both the education of the young and the general dissemination of religious knowledge ; but after the peace the missionary societies were suppressed, and very harsh measures adopted&nbsp;against the universities. In several particulars a better&nbsp;spirit prevailed. That tolerant disposition towards the various sects of Christianity, of which we have remarked more&nbsp;than one instance in passing, had already become systematic, and was never departed from. The emancipation of the&nbsp;peasants from their state of serfdom was long a favourite&nbsp;object with the emperor, who was able to attain it in Cour-land, Livonia, and one or two other provinces, and used&nbsp;openly to lament that private interests and prejudices had&nbsp;baffled his good intentions elsewhere. Another plan of his,&nbsp;which was connected with the scheme just mentioned, was&nbsp;that of the military colonies, of which Dr Lyall has published an interesting account. The advantages which this&nbsp;system promised to confer were these : the diminution of&nbsp;the expenses of the army in times of peace, and the easy&nbsp;training of a large agricultural population to the trade of&nbsp;war. For these purposes villages were built on the crown-estates along the western frontier of the empire, and in&nbsp;these, soon after the peace, formidable detachments of soldiers were settled with their families, and mixed among the&nbsp;boors who, belonging to the crown, had previously been the&nbsp;sole or the principal inhabitants of the districts. The whole&nbsp;male population of these new settlements was to occupy itself alternately in rural labour and military exercises ; and&nbsp;while the troops who had already seen service were always&nbsp;in a position to take the field again, the boors were gradually to qualify themselves for acting as a corps de reserve,&nbsp;and for filling up vacancies. The plan excited considerable opposition ; and although the obstacles were finally to&nbsp;appearance vanquished, and the colonies speedily mustered&nbsp;four hundred thousand fighting men, yet new difficulties&nbsp;have arisen since Alexander’s death, and the present emperor has abandoned the idea of extending the principle, or&nbsp;making it permanent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">During the last few years of Alexander’s life he appears to have been completely miserable. To family misfortunes, religious despondency, and disappointment in political&nbsp;schemes, was added the continual terror of conspiracies in&nbsp;the heart of the empire, which were said to have ramifications everywhere, and to aim at nothing less than a total&nbsp;revolution, and the assassination of the whole royal family.&nbsp;Those constant travels through the several Russian provinces in which Alexander was engaged for two or three&nbsp;years before his death, have been mainly attributed by&nbsp;some writers to his dread of poison or the dagger. In the&nbsp;course of one of these journeys he died at Taganrog, on the&nbsp;Sea of Azof, on the 1st day of December 1825.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Alexander’s brother, the Grand Duke Constantine, whose conduct as governor of Poland has been described in our&nbsp;article on the history of that country, was immediately proclaimed emperor at St Petersburg ; and whatever may have&nbsp;been the feelings of the Russians themselves, foreigners&nbsp;who were acquainted with the new sovereign by his general reputation, looked on his accession with pity for his subjects and alarm for the peace of Europe. But the danger&nbsp;had been foreseen and averted by Alexander and the rest&nbsp;of the family. Constantine had been induced to resign his&nbsp;claims to the crown by a formal deed executed in 1822.&nbsp;The senate, on opening the will of Alexander, found it to&nbsp;contain a nomination of his second brother, the Grand Duke&nbsp;Nicholas, as his successor in the empire.
