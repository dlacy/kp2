<p><span class="font2">iu the structure of all languages, and therefore must be common to all men who speak with understanding ” (Hamilton’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reid,</span><span class="font2"> pp.&nbsp;229 and 454).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The principles which Reid insists upon as everywhere present in experience evidently correspond pretty closely to the Kantian&nbsp;Categoriesandthe unity of apperception. Similarly, Reid’s&nbsp;assertion of the essential distinction between space or&nbsp;extension and feeling or any succession of feelings may&nbsp;be compared with Kant’s doctrine in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Aesthetic.</span><span class="font2"> “ Space/’&nbsp;he says, “ whether tangible or visible, is not so properly&nbsp;an object [Kant’s “ matter ”] as a necessary concomitant of the&nbsp;objects both of sight and touch.” . Like Kant, too, Reid finds in&nbsp;space the source of a necessity which sense, as sense, cannot give&nbsp;(Hamilton’s </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Reid,</span><span class="font2"> p. 323). In the substance of their answer to Hume,&nbsp;the two philosophers have therefore much in common. But Reid&nbsp;lacked the art to give due impressiveness to the important advance&nbsp;which his positions really contain. Although at times he states&nbsp;his principles with a wonderful degree of breadth and insight, he&nbsp;mars the effect by looseness of statement, and by the incorporation&nbsp;of irrelevant psychological matter. And, if Kant was overridden&nbsp;by a love of symmetry, Reid’s indifference to form and system is&nbsp;an even more dangerous defect. Further, Reid is inclined to state&nbsp;his principles dogmatically rather than as logical deductions. The&nbsp;transcendental deduction, or proof from the possibility of experience in general, which forms the vital centre of the Kantian scheme,&nbsp;is wanting in Reid; or, at all events, if the spirit of the proof is&nbsp;occasionally present, it is nowhere adequately developed. Nevertheless, Reid s insistence on judgment as the unit of knowledge and&nbsp;his sharp distinction between sensation and perception must still</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">be recognized as of the highest importance.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The relativism or phenomenalism which Hamilton afterwards adopted from Kant and sought to engraft upon Scottish philosophy&nbsp;is wholly absent from the original Scottish doctrine. .One&nbsp;or two passages may certainly be quoted from Reid in&nbsp;which he asserts that we know only properties of things&nbsp;and are ignorant of their essence. But the exact meaning&nbsp;which he attaches to such expressions is not quite clear; and they&nbsp;occur, moreover, only incidentally and with the air of current phrases&nbsp;mechanically repeated. Dugald Stewart, however, deliberately&nbsp;emphasizes the merely qualitative nature of our knowledge as the&nbsp;foundation of philosophical argument, and thus paves the way for&nbsp;the thoroughgoing philosophy of nescience elaborated by Hamilton.&nbsp;But since Hamilton’s time the most typical Scottish thinkers have&nbsp;repudiated his relativistic doctrine, and returned to the original</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">tradition of the school. For Reid’s ethical theory, see Ethics.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">REID, THOMAS MAYNE (1818-1883), better known as Mayne Reid, British novelist, the son of a Presbyterian minister,&nbsp;was born at Ballyroney, Co. Down, Ireland, on the 4th of April&nbsp;1818. His own early life was as adventurous as any boy&nbsp;reader of his novels could desire. He was educated for the&nbsp;church, but did not take orders, and when twenty years old&nbsp;went to America in search of excitement and fortune. He&nbsp;made trading excursions on the Red river, studying the ways&nbsp;of the red man and the white pioneer. He made acquaintance&nbsp;with the Missouri in the same manner, and roved through all&nbsp;the states of the Union. In Philadelphia, where he was engaged&nbsp;in journalism from 1843 to 1846, he made the acquaintance of&nbsp;Edgar Allan Poe. When the war with Mexico broke out in 1846&nbsp;he obtained a captain’s commission, was present at the siege&nbsp;and capture of Vera Cruz, and led a forlorn hope at ChapuIte-pec, where he sustained such severe injuries that his life was&nbsp;despaired of. In one of his novels he says that he believed&nbsp;theoretically in the military value of untrained troops, and&nbsp;that he had found his theories confirmed in actual warfare.&nbsp;An enthusiastic republican, he offered his services to the&nbsp;Hungarian insurgents in 1849, raised a body of volunteers,&nbsp;and sailed for Europe, but arrived too late. He then settled in&nbsp;England, and began his career of a novelist with the publication,&nbsp;in 1850, of the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rifle Rangers.</span><span class="font1"> This was followed next year&nbsp;by the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Scalp Hunters.</span><span class="font1"> He never surpassed his first productions,&nbsp;except perhaps in </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The White Chief</span><span class="font1"> (1859) and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">The Quadroon&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(1856); but he continued to produce tales of self-reliant enterprise and exciting adventure with great fertility. Simplicity of&nbsp;plot and easy variety of exciting incident are among the merits&nbsp;that contribute to his popularity with boys. His reflections&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">are </span><span class="font1">not profound, but are frequently more sensible than might&nbsp;be presumed at first from his aggressive manner of expressing&nbsp;them. He died in London on the 22nd of October 1883.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">diplomatist, was bom of Scotch parentage, near Xenia, Ohio, on the 27th of October 1837. He graduated at Miami University in 1856, and spoke frequently in behalf of John C.&nbsp;Fremont, the Republican candidate for the presidency in&nbsp;that year; was superintendent of schools of South Charleston,&nbsp;Ohio, in 1856-58, and in 1858-59 was editor of the Xenia&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">News.</span><span class="font1"> In i860 he became legislative correspondent at&nbsp;Columbus for several Ohio newspapers, including the Cincinnati&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette,</span><span class="font1"> of which he was made city editor in 1861. He was&nbsp;war correspondent for the </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font1"> in 1861-62, serving also&nbsp;as volunteer aide-de-camp (with the rank of captain) to General&nbsp;Thomas A.

He was Washington correspondent of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Gazette</span><span class="font1"> in 1862-68, acting incidentally as clerk of the military committee of Congress (1862-63) and as librarian of the&nbsp;House of Representatives (1863-66).

He&nbsp;declined an appointment as United States minister to Germany&nbsp;in 1877 and again in 1881, but served as minister to France in&nbsp;1889-92, and in 1892 was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for vice-president on the ticket with Benjamin Harrison.&nbsp;In 1897 he was special ambassador of the United States on the&nbsp;occasion of Queen Victoria’s jubilee; in 1898 was a member of&nbsp;the commission which arranged the terms of peace between&nbsp;the United States and Spain; in 1902 was special ambassador&nbsp;of the United States at the coronation of King Edward VII.,&nbsp;and in 1905 became ambassador to Great Britain. He was&nbsp;elected a life member of the New York State Board of Regents&nbsp;in 1878; and in 1902 he became vice-chancellor and, in 1904,&nbsp;chancellor of the university of the state of New York. In 1881&nbsp;he married a daughter of Darius Ogden Mills (1825-1910), a&nbsp;prominent financier.</span></p>
