            <p>arc ſo interwoven with each other, that neither of them could have been written by a
                man who lived in a later age. The account which is given in the book of Exodus of
                the conduct of Pharaoh towards the children of Iſrael, is ſuch as might be expected
                from a writer who was not only acquainted with the country at large, but had
                frequent acceſs to the court of its ſovereign: and the minute geographical
                deſcription of the paſſage thro’ Arabia is ſuch, as could have been given only by a
                man like Moſes, who had ſpent 40 years in the land of Midian. The language itſelf is
                a proof of its high antiquity, which appears partly from the great ſimplicity of the
                ſtyle, and partly from the uſe of archaiſms or antiquated expreſſions, which in the
                days even of David and Solomon were obſolete@@<hi rend="smallcaps">(b).</hi> But the
                ſtrongeſt argument that can be produced to ſhow that the Pentateuch was written by a
                man born and educated in Egypt, is the uſe of Egyptian words; words which never
                were, or ever could have been, uſed by a native of Paleſtine: and it is a remarkable
                circumſtance, that the very ſame thing which Moſes had expreſſed by a word that is
                pare Egyptian, Iſaiah, as might be expected from his birth and education, has
                expreſſed by a word that is purely Hebrew @@(C).</p>
            <p>That Moſes was the author of the Pentateuch is proved alſo from the evidence of
                teſtimony. We do not here quote the authority of Diodorus Siculus, of Longinus, or
                Strabo, becauſe their information muſt have been derived from the Jews. We ſhall
                ſeek no authority but that of the ſucceeding ſacred books themſelves, which bear
                internal evidence that they were written in different ages, and therefore could not
                be forged unleſs we were to adopt the abſurd opinion that there was a ſucceſſion of
                impoſtors among the Jews who united together in the ſame fraud. The Jews were
                certainly beſt qualified to judge of the authenticity of their own books. They could
                judge of the truth of the facts recorded, and they could have no intereſt in
                adopting a forgery. Indeed, to ſuppoſe a whole nation combined in committing a
                forgery, and that this combination ſhould continue for many hundred years, would be
                the moſt chimerical ſuppoſition that ever entered into the mind of man. Yet we muſt
                make this ſuppoſition, if we reject the hiſtorical ſacts of the Old Teſtament. No
                one will deny that the Pentateuch exiſted in the time of Chriſt and his apoſtles;
                for they not only mention it, but quote it. “This we admit,” reply the advocates for
                the hypotheſis which we are now combating; “but you cannot therefore conclude that
                Moſes was the author; for there is reaſon to believe it was compoſed by Ezra.” But
                unfortunately for men of this opinion, both Ezra and Nehemiah aſcribe the book of
                the law to Moſes @@*. 2. The Pentateuch was in the poſſeſſion of the Samaritans
                before the time of Ezra. 3. It exiſted in the reign of Amaziah king of Judah, A.C.
                839</p>
            <p>years@@†. 4. It was in public uſe in the reign of Jehoſaphat, A.C. 912; for that
                virtuous prince appointed Levites and prieſts who taught in Judah, and had the book
                of the law of the Lord with them, and went about throughout all the cities of Judah
                and taught the people@@‡. It is referred to by David in his dying admonitions to
                Solomon@@§. The ſame royal bard makes many alluſions to it in the book of Pſalms,
                and ſometimes quotes it@@*. There remains therefore only one reſource to thoſe who
                contend that Moſes was not the author, <hi rend="italic">viz.</hi> that it was
                written in the period which elapſed between the age of Joſhua and that of David. But
                the whole hiſtory of the Jews from their feulement in Canaan to the building of the
                temple preſuppoſes that the book of the law was written by Moſes. 6. We have
                ſatisfactory evidence that it exiſted in the time of Joſhua. One paſſage maybe
                quoted where this fact is ſtated. The Divine Being makes uſe of theſe words to
                Joſhua: “Only be thou ſtrong, and very courageous, that thou mayeſt obſerve to do
                all according to <hi rend="italic">the law</hi> which Moſes my ſervant commanded
                thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou mayeſt proſper
                whitherſoever thou goeſt. <hi rend="italic">This book of the law</hi> ſhall not
                depart out of thy mouth; but thou ſhalt meditate therein day and night, that thou
                mayeſt obſerve to do according to all that is written therein@@†.”</p>
            <p>To the foregoing demonſtration objections may be ſtated. “We will admit the force of
                your arguments, and grant that Moſes actually wrote a work called the book of the
                law; but how can we be certain that it was the very work which is now current under
                his name? And unleſs you can ſhow this to be at leaſt probable, your whole evidence
                is of no value.” To illuſtrate the force or weakneſs of this objection, let us apply
                it to ſome ancient Greek author, and ſee whether a claſſical ſcholar would allow it
                to be of weight. “It is true that the Greek writers ſpeak of Homer as an ancient and
                celebrated poet; it is true alſo that they have quoted from the works which they
                aſcribe to him various paſſages that we find at preſent in the Iliad and Odyſſey:
                yet ſtill there is a poſſibility that the poems wſhich were written by Homer, and
                thoſe which we call the <hi rend="italic">Iliad and Odyſſey,</hi> were totally
                diſtinct productions” Now an advocate for Greek literature would reply to this
                objection, not with a ſerious anſwer, but with a ſmile of contempt; and he would
                think it beneath his dignity to ſilence an opponent who appeared to be deaf to the
                cleareſt conviction. But ſtill more may be ſaid in defence of Moſes than in defence
                of Homer; for the writings of the latter were not depoſited in any temple or ſacred
                archive, in order to ſecure them from the devaſtations of time; whereas the copy of
                the book of the law, as written by Moſes, was intruſted to the prieſts and the
                elders, preſerved in the ark of the covenant,</p>
