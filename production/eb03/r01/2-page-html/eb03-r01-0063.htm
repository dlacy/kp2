Edwards ſuppoſes, that the&nbsp;whiteneſs is produced by the cold climate of Hudſon’s&nbsp;Bay, from which he received it, and that they reſume&nbsp;their brown feathers during the ſummer. It appears that&nbsp;ſeveral ſpecies of this bird have ſpread further into A-merica, and have even reached the fouthern provinces :&nbsp;for Sloane found our third ſpecies in Jamaica ; and Fernandez ſeems to indicate two of them in New Spain,&nbsp;by the names </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">chiquatototl</span><span class="font4"> and </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">elototαtl ;</span><span class="font4"> the former being&nbsp;like our woodcock, and the latter lodging under the&nbsp;ſtalks of maize.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">A bird of this kind, Mr Latham ſays, was ſent ſrom Hudſon’s Bay, and from the figure, has every appear-ance of an avoſet : however, in Edwards’s plate, the&nbsp;toes appear cloven to the bottom ; a circumſtance ſeeming to overturn the fuppoſition, and only to be authen-ticated when other ſpecimens ſhall have come under the&nbsp;eye of the well-informed naturaliſt.</span></p>

It comprehends Ruſſia pro-perly ſo called, volhinia, and Podolia. lt is about&nbsp;650 miles in length, and from 150 to 250 in breadth.&nbsp;It conſiſts chiefly of large fields, but little cultivated&nbsp;on account of the frequent inroads of the Tartars, and&nbsp;becauſe there is no water-carriage. It had the name&nbsp;of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Red Rujfia,</span><span class="font4"> from the colour of the hair of its inha-bitants.

As no river falls into it of ſuffi-cient force to counteract the influence of the tide, it is more affected by the motions of the great ocean than&nbsp;any oſ the inland ſeas nearly in the ſame latitude. It&nbsp;is not much expofed to tempeſts : the winds uſually&nbsp;blow from north to ſouth, and being periodical, like&nbsp;the monſoons of India, invariably determine the feafon&nbsp;of foiling into or out of this ſea. It is divided into two&nbsp;gulphs ; that to the eaſt was called the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Ælanitic gulph,&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">from the city Ælana at the north end of it ; and that&nbsp;to the weſt the </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Heroopolitic,</span><span class="font4"> from the city of Heroopo-lis ; the former of which belongs to Arabia, and the&nbsp;latter to Egypt.</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">Mr Bruce has made many obſervations on this ſea, which are worthy of notice.—with regard to the name,&nbsp;he fays ſt was certainly derived from Edom or Efou&nbsp;the ſon of Jacob ; though in another place he fays, he&nbsp;wonders that writers have not rather fuppoſed it to&nbsp;have got the epithet of </span><span class="font4" style="font-style:italic;">Red,</span><span class="font4"> from the colour of the&nbsp;fond on its coaſts, than for other reaſons they have alleged. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">w </span><span class="font4">ith regard to any redneſs in the water itſelf,&nbsp;or in the bottom, which ſome have aſſerted, our travel-ler aſſures us that there is no ſuch thing. It is more difficult to aſſign a reafon for the Hebrew name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">it,&nbsp;</span><span class="font4">which ſignifies the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Sea of Weeds ;</span><span class="font4"> as he never faw a&nbsp;weed throughout the whole extent of it. &quot; Indeed,&nbsp;(ſays he) upon the ſlighteſt conſideration, it will occur&nbsp;to any one, that a narrow gulph, under the immediate&nbsp;influence of the monſoons, blowing from contrary&nbsp;points ſix months each year, would have too much agi-tation to produce ſuch vegetables, ſeldom found but in&nbsp;ſtagnant waters, and ſeldom, if ever, found in folt ones.&nbsp;My opinion then is, that it is from the large trees&nbsp;or plants of white coral, ſpread everywhere over the&nbsp;bottom of the Red Sea, perfectly in imitation of plants&nbsp;on land, that the fea has obtained this name.—I ſaw&nbsp;one of theſe, which, from a root nearly central, threw&nbsp;out ramifications of an almoſt circular form, meaſuring&nbsp;26 feet every way.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font4">our author has alſo made many uſeful obſervations on the navigation of this ſea. &quot; All the weſtern ſhore&nbsp;(he fays) is bold, and has more depth of water than&nbsp;the eaſt; but on this fide there is neither anchoring&nbsp;ground nor ſhoals. It is rocky, with a conſiderable&nbsp;depth of water everywhere ; and there are a number of&nbsp;ſunken rocks, which, though not viſible, are ſufficiently&nbsp;near the ſurface to deſtroy a large ſhip.” The cauſe of&nbsp;this, in Mr Bruce’s opinion, is, that the mountains on&nbsp;the ſide of Abyſſinia and Egypt are all of hard ſtone,&nbsp;porphyry, many different kinds of marble, granite, ala-baſter, and baſaltes. Thefe being all compoſed of ſo-lid materials, therefore, can part with very little duſt&nbsp;or fond, which might otherwiſe be blown from them&nbsp;into the ſea. Οη the oppoſite coaſt, viz. that of He-jaz and Tahamah, on thc Arabian ſide, the whole con-ſiſts of moving fonds ; a large quantity of which is&nbsp;blown from the ſouth-eaſt by the dry winter monſoons;&nbsp;which being lodged among the rocks on that ſide, and&nbsp;confined there by the north-eaſt or ſummer monſoon,&nbsp;which is in a contrary direction, hinders them from coming over to the Egyptian fide. Hence the weſtern&nbsp;coaſt is full of funk rocks for want of fond to cover&nbsp;them, with which they would otherwiſe become iſlands.&nbsp;They are naked and bare all round, with ſharp points&nbsp;like ſpears ; while, on the eaſt-ſide, every rock becomes</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
