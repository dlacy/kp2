<p><span class="font2">At the northern end of the curved platform there is a cylindrical structure of concrete faced with brick and lined with thin marble&nbsp;slabs; it is in three stages, each diminishing in size, and&nbsp;appears to be an addition of about the time of Severus.&nbsp;This is usually identified with the Umbilicus Romae, or&nbsp;central point of the city, mentioned in the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia</span><span class="font2"> and the&nbsp;Einsicdeln MS.(Jordan, </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Topographicder Stadt Rom,</span><span class="font2"> ii.6^5).</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Near the rostra, below the temple of Saturn, stood the Milliarium Aureum, a marble column sheathed in gilt bronze and inscribed&nbsp;with the names and distances of the chief towns on the roads which&nbsp;radiated from the thirty-seven gates of Rome (Plin.. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">II, N.</span><span class="font2"> ni. 66).&nbsp;It was set up by Augustus in 20 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.,</span><span class="font2"> and its position “ sub aede&nbsp;Saturni ” is indicated by Tacitus </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Hist,</span><span class="font2"> i. 27; see schol. on Suet.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Otho.</span><span class="font2"> 6, and Plut. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Galba,</span><span class="font2"> 24). The Miliarium is mentioned in&nbsp;the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Notitia</span><span class="font2"> (Reg. viii.) as being near the Vicus Jugarius. Its precise position cannot be determined. Fragments of a marble cylinder&nbsp;and cornice with floriated reliefs, now lying in front of the temple&nbsp;of Saturn, probably belonged to this monument; they were found&nbsp;in 1835 near the supposed site.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The position of the temple of Saturn is indicated in Àfon. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Anc. </span><span class="font2">(see below, n. 6) and shown on the marble plan, and is also identified&nbsp;by various passages in ancient writers. Varro (L.L. v. 42)&nbsp;speaks of it as being </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">infaucibus Capitolii;</span><span class="font2"> Servius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ad Aen.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">ii. 115) says that it is in front of the Clivus Capitolinus, and&nbsp;near the temple of Concord (see Plate VIII.). It was built against&nbsp;a steep slope or outlying part of the Capitoline hill<sup>@@1</sup> (cf. Dionys.&nbsp;i. 34) on the site of a prehistoric altar to Saturn,, after whom the&nbsp;Capitoline hill was originally called Mons Saturnius. The public&nbsp;treasury was part of this temple (Serv. </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Ad Aen. ü.</span><span class="font2"> 116, and Maerob.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Sat.</span><span class="font2"> i. 8). The original temple is said by Varro (ap. Maerob. i. 8)&nbsp;to have been begun by the last Tarquin, and dedicated by T. Larcius,&nbsp;the first dictator, 498 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">B.C.; </span><span class="font2">but Dionysius (vi. 1) and Livy (ii. 21)&nbsp;attribute it to the consuls A. Sempronius and M. Minucius in 497 </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">b.c.&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">It was rebuilt on a larger scale by L.

The only part remaining of this date is the very&nbsp;lofty podium of massive travertine blocks, and part of the lower&nbsp;course of Athenian marble, with which the whole was faced. In&nbsp;the 16th century a piece of the marble frieze was found, inscribed&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">D . PLANCVS . L . F . COS . IMPER . ITER . DE .

P0PVLV3QVE . ROMANVS . INCENDIO.&nbsp;CONSVMTVM . RESTITVIT, </span><span class="font2">belongs to the last rebuilding in&nbsp;the time of Diocletian. Some of these fine columns are evidently&nbsp;earlier than this rebuilding, but were refixed with rude caps&nbsp;and bases. One of the columns is set wrong way up, and the&nbsp;whole work is of the most careless sort. Part of the inscription,&nbsp;once inlaid with bronze, recording this latest rebuilding, still&nbsp;exists on the entablature. On the Forum side the temple is flanked&nbsp;by the Vicus Jugarius, while the steep Clivus Capitolinus winds&nbsp;round the front of the great flight of steps leading up to the cella,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">and then </span><span class="font2">turns along the north-west side of the temple.<sup>@@2</sup> The&nbsp;Vicus Jugarius (see fig. 8), part of the basalt paving of&nbsp;which is now exposed, was so called (see Festus, ed. M tiller,&nbsp;p. 104) from an altar to Juno Juga, the guardian of&nbsp;marriage. Starting from the Forum, it passed between the temple&nbsp;of Saturn and the Basilica Julia, then close under the cliff of&nbsp;the Capitolium (see Liv. xxxv. 21) and on to the Porta Carmen-talis. I t was spanned at its commencement by a brick-faced arch&nbsp;lined with marble, the lower part of which exists, and is not earlier&nbsp;than the 3rd or 4th century.<sup>@@3</sup> At this end of the Forum the arch of&nbsp;Tiberius w’as built beside the Sacra Via.

<p><span class="font2">The Basilica Julia<sup>@@5</sup> occupies a great part of the south-west side of the Forum, along the line of the Sacra Via; its ends&nbsp;are bounded by the Vicus Jugarius and the Vicus&nbsp;Tuscus.

It consisted of a central hall with aisles, galleries&nbsp;and clerestory, surrounded on three sides by a colonnade in two&nbsp;storeys approached by steps; on the S.W.a row of rooms or tabernac&nbsp;took the place of the colonnade. The central nave was paved with&nbsp;richly coloured oriental marbles, namely pavonazzetto, cipollino,&nbsp;giallo and africano. The covered aisles are paved with large slabs&nbsp;of white marble..<sup>@@7</sup> Many </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">tabulae lusoriae,</span><span class="font2"> or gambling boards, are&nbsp;scratched on this marble paving (cf.

These fires had destroyed nearly all the fine marble&nbsp;arches of Augustus; and Diocletian rebuilt it mostly with brick&nbsp;or travertine piers, portions of which remain.<sup>@@9</sup> A final restoration is&nbsp;recorded in inscriptions discovered at various times from the 16th&nbsp;century onwards, as being carried out by Gabinius Vettius Probianus,&nbsp;praefect of the city in 377; one of these is on a pedestal which now&nbsp;stands in the Vicus Jugarius. Suetonius </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Cal.</span><span class="font2"> 37) mentions that it&nbsp;was one of Caligula’s amusements to throw money to the people&nbsp;below from the roof of this basilica, which formed a link in the bridge&nbsp;by which this maniac connected the Palatine with the Capitolium.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Vicus Tuscus passes from the Sacra Via between the Basilica Julia and the temple of Castor to the Velabrum and Circus Maximus; its basalt paving has been exposed at many points&nbsp;along its w’hole line. A very early statue of Vortumnus&nbsp;stood in this street, a little to the south-west of the&nbsp;Basilica Julia, where part of its pedestal was found in 1549 inscribed&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">VORTVMNVS TEMPORIBVS DIOCLETIANI .
