.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Family I.—Cοlubriform Venomous Serpents.</hi></p><p>The poisonous species here assembled, although provided with envenomed fangs, so nearly resemble the Colubers in their general external forms as to be easily mistaken for them by an inexperienced eye. They also partake in some points of the features of the sea-serpents, but are distinguished by wanting the flattened tail ; while from the concluding family of venomous serpents <hi rend="italic">properly so called,</hi> they are kept apart by the bulkier proportions, thick triangular heads, vertical pupils, and carinated scales, which characterize the species lost alluded to. At the same time it must be admitted, that those rigorous and distinct demarcations which so many lovers of nature desire to establish, but which so few can find, occur as seldom here as in other departments of zoology,—several species in each family showing a strong tendency of transition towards another.</p><p>The reptiles of our present family have a more slenderly elongated form than those of other poisonous groups. Their trunk is in general a good deal drawn out, sometimes cylindrical, or slightly compressed. Their tail, like that of all poisonous species, is rather short, conical, and rounded at the extremity. Their head, almost always of nearly equal dimensions with the neck, is small, short, and obtuse at the extremity. The eyes are rather small, sometimes vertical, the pupil always orbicular. The nostrils, always lateral and rather open, are pierced in a large plate on each side of the muzzle. The scales are not numerous, of medium size, and always smooth,—except in <hi rend="italic">Naja hæmachates,</hi> in which they seem surmounted by a keel. The abdomen is constantly convex, and furnished with plates of greater or less extent, according to the species. But what particularly characterizes this family is, that all the genera of which it is composed have the crown of the head covered by nine plates,<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0166.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s02-0147"/>
modelled after the type of those of Coluber. The poison apparatus is much less developed than among other venomous kinds ; but the fangs, though short, are strong. The species inhabit the warmer countries of both the New and Old World, but do not occur in Europe. They form three generic groups, as after mentioned.</p><p>Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Elaps.</hi> Body slender and cylindrical, of nearly equal size throughout, and usually encompassed by fifteen rows of broad, smooth scales. Head elongated, and not strongly distinguishable from the trunk.</p><p>This genus was established by Schneider,<note anchored="true" n="1" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>I <hi rend="italic">Hist. Aιιιphib.</hi> ii. p. 289.</p></note> * and now contains all those slender-bodied venomous kinds, which by their elongated forms remind us of <hi rend="italic">Tortrix and Calamaria.</hi> They attain to no great size, seldom reaching three or four feet in length, and scarcely exceeding a finger’s thickness in diameter. Their colours are often bright and beautiful, a combination of red and black being frequent among them. They prefer countries covered by an abundant vegetation, concealing themselves amid the herbs of the meadows, or the loftier luxuriance of the forest ; and with this circumstance we may connect the fact, that only a single species is found in Africa, all the others occurring in tropical America, New Holland, the Indian Archipelago, and Bengal,— the latter country however producing likewise only a solitary instance in <hi rend="italic">Elaps trimaculatus.</hi> Their agility is by no means great, and they prey chiefly on other reptiles,—birds being probably too active, quadrupeds too large, and fish too aquatic, for creatures of slowish movement, small size, and terrestrial habits. We cannot here detail the species, of which eleven are described by M. Schlegel, but must rest satisfied by referring, as examples, to a few figures, such as,— <hi rend="italic">E. corallinus (Nova Acta,</hi> x. pl. 4), <hi rend="italic">E. Surinamensis (Seba,</hi> ii. pl. 86, fig. 2), <hi rend="italic">E. collaris ( Erpétol. de Java,</hi> pl. 45), <hi rend="italic">E. trimaculatus (</hi> Russel, <hi rend="italic">Ind. Serf.</hi> i. pl. 8).</p><p>Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Bungarus.</hi> Form more robust than that of Elaps. Head broad, depressed, rounded terminally, and towards the sides. Abdomen convex. Tail robust. Dorsal line furnished with a row of hexagonal scales, larger than the rest. Sub-caudal plates simple.</p><p>To this genus belong the <hi rend="italic">Bungarum pamma</hi> of Russel <hi rend="italic">( Ind. Serp.</hi> i. pl. 3), <hi rend="italic">B. annularis,</hi> Daudin, and the <hi rend="italic">Geei Paragoodoo</hi> of the former author, <hi rend="italic">Β. sernifasciatus</hi> of Khul and Schlegel. Both species inhabit India, as well as Java and Ceylon. The natives of India, who are said generally to exaggerate the noxious character of their serpents, assert that the bite of the latter produces immediate death, although Dr Russel’s experiments go to prove that it is seldom fatal to chickens in less than half an hour, or to dogs in a shorter period than an hour and a half. A <hi rend="italic">Geedi Paragoodoo</hi> was made to bite a large dog on the thigh, near the groin, where it held fast for more than twenty seconds, but the fangs scarcely penetrated farther than the skin. The dog howled much when first wounded, but on being set at liberty walked about for a time without manifesting any peculiar symptoms. In ten minutes, however, he drew up the wounded leg, continuing to stand on the other three ; in a quarter of an hour he crouched, and howled again, and the thigh became paralytic, though the poor creature was still able to raise himself; in twenty-five minutes both thighs were paralytic; and in the course of the second hour he became greatly disordered, grew apparently torpid, lay panting on one side, and died in about two hours, without convulsions. Another dog of smaller size expired in one hour and ten minutes, after being strongly convulsed for some minutes prior to its death.</p><p>Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Naja.</hi> General form robust. Body not cylindrical, but thickening in the middle, and tapering towards either end. Tail lengthened and conical. Abdomen broad and convex. Head well distinguished from the trunk. Eyes</p><p>large and lateral. Neck more or less capable of inflation.</p><p>This genus contains the famous 'hooded or spectacle- snakes, called <hi rend="italic">cobras de capello</hi> by the Portuguese, the majority having the power of raising the anterior ribs, so as to produce a peculiar disk-like inflation of the neck or upper portion of the body. The species are peculiar to the ancient world,—if New Holland, which produces two, and was unknown to the ancients, may be classed therein. M. Schlegel describes eleven different kinds, many of which, however, are arranged in separate genera by other writers, but which that author regards as forming an uninterrupted series, closely connected with each other, and of which the foremost exhibit the announced generic characteristics in great strength and precision, while the others gradually depart from the type, and form a passage to the vipers.</p><p>The hooded snake, commonly so called <hi rend="italic">(coluber naja</hi> of the older writers,— <hi rend="italic">Naja tripudians</hi> of the recent systema- tists), is one of the most noted as well as noxious of the Indian reptiles. Its general length is from three to four feet, and the diameter of its body about an inch and a quarter. The inflated portion is marked above by a large conspicuous patch, closely resembling the figure of an old-fashioned pair of spectacles. The usual colour of the upper parts is pale ferruginous brown, the under being of a bluish white occasionally tinged with yellow. The terminal portion tapers gradually, and ends in a rather slender sharp-pointed extremity. In India this dreaded species is more universally known than any other. It is frequently exhibited as a public show, and being carried about in a covered basket, is made to assume a kind of dancing motion (a modification, we presume, of some natural and instinctive movement) for the amusement of the public. Raising itself up on its lower extremity, and moving its head and body alternately from side to side, the insidious creature seems pleased by keeping time with the measured melody of “ flutes and soft recorders.” We presume that a love of music is natural to certain serpents ; and that this fact was observed of old in Palestine, is probable from the expression of the inspired Psalmist, who compares the ungodly to the deaf adder, which “ stoppeth her ears, and refuseth to hear the voice of the charmer.” Chateaubriand relates that he was an eyewitness, on the banks of the Genesee, to the fact of a native appeasing the wrath of a rattle-snake (which he even caused to follow him), merely by the music of his flute. The dancing snakes of India are usually, though not universally, deprived of their poison-fangs. “ When the music ceases,” says Mr Forbes, “the snakes appear motionless; but if not immediately covered up in the basket, the spectators are liable to fatal accidents. Among my drawings is that of a <hi rend="italic">cobra de capella,</hi> which danced for an hour on the table while I painted it ; during which I frequently handled it to observe the beauty of the spots, and especially the spectacles on the hood, not doubting but that its venomous fangs had been previously extracted. But the next morning my upper servant, who was a zealous Mussulman, came to me in great haste, and desired I would instantly retire and praise the Almighty for my good fortune. Not understanding his meaning, I told him that I had already performed my devotions, and had not so many stated prayers as the followers of his prophet. Mohammed then informed me, that while purchasing some fruit in the bazaar, he observed the man who had been with me the preceding evening, entertaining the country people with his dancing snakes ; they, according to their usual custom, sat on the ground around him ; when, either from the music stopping too suddenly, or from some other cause irritating the vicious reptile which I had often handled, it darted at the throat of a young woman, and inflicted a wound of which she died in half an hour.”<note anchored="true" n="2" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic superscript"> tt</hi> <hi rend="italic">Oriental Memoirs.</hi> i. p. <hi rend="italic">44.</hi></p></note> ’ A similar fate had<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0168.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s02-0149"/>
Great Western. M. Schlegel characterizes the statement as an “ assertion que je puis contredire avec certitude.” Believing that there are more things in heaven and earth than are “ dream’t of in our philosophy,” and desiring to bear in mind the sentiment of the inspired apostle, that “ if any man think that he knoweth any thing, he knoweth nothing yet as he ought to know,” we shall content ourselves by stating that sea-serpents have not yet been observed in the Atlantic Ocean. M. Schlegel’s researches have led him to believe that they are confined “ aux mers intertropicales, ou voisines des tropiques, comprises entre le 90me et les 230me degrés de longit. or. du méridien de Ferro.”<note anchored="true" n="3" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Physiog. des Serpents,</hi> ii. p. 491.</p></note> We shall here state the chief of the actual localities. Several species were received by Dr Russel from among the numerous islands called Sunderabunds, which form the delta of the Ganges. The same author likewise obtained many from different points along the coast of Coromandel. Sir Stamford Raffles mentions three species which frequent the coasts of Sumatra.<note anchored="true" n="4" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">’ Phil. Trans,</hi> xiii. part ii. p. 334.</p></note> The Dutch voyagers have observed only a single species on the coast of Java, but they have met with several among the Moluccas, near Timor, Banda, and the shores of New Guinea Dr Strauss transmitted two species from the Celebes. M. Von Siebold observed them to abound in the China Sea, and met with many in the course of his passage from Java to Japan, from the region of the equator as far north as the 27th degree. Eschholtz has incidentally observed,<note anchored="true" n="5" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>ln Kotzebue’s <hi rend="italic">Neue Reise, Anh.</hi> p. 32.</p></note> that the fishermen of the Philippine Islands capture <hi rend="italic">Acrochordus fasciatus</hi> in the Bay of Manilla, and that this reptile cannot move upon the land. Now it so happens that the Acrochordi correctly so called never inhabit the sea ; and it may therefore be inferred that the observer last named had in view, not an <hi rend="italic">Acrochordus,</hi> but a sea-snake or <hi rend="italic">Hydrophis.</hi> It is long since Dampier told us of those which he saw along the western shores of New Holland ;<note anchored="true" n="6" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Vayayes,</hi> iv. p. 107 and 113.</p></note> as did afterwards Sir Joseph Banks along the eastern coast, from the 20th to the 10th degree of north latitude. Forster, as Schneider has recorded, found <hi rend="italic">Hyd. pelamys</hi> abundant near Otaheite.</p><p>The habits of these reptiles are indicated here and there by different writers. Dr Russel describes their aquatic movements as active and elegant, but they have scarcely any locomotive power on land, and speedily die when either brought ashore or placed in fresh water. He found in the abdomen of a female Hydrophis nine perfectly formed young, each of which was enclosed in an egg or envelope, from which (the matured condition) it may be inferred that they are viviparous. It would also seem that their manners are milder than those of the generality of poisonous species. Dr Russel, at least, assures us in regard to <hi rend="italic">Hyd. gracilis,</hi> that no provocation would induce it to bite any object presented to it. Neither could M. Lesson succeed in his disinterested attempts to make <hi rend="italic">Hyd. pelamys</hi> wound any poultry, though he kindly put them together alive into a copper bathing tub.<note anchored="true" n="7" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic superscript"> a</hi> <hi rend="italic">Coquille,</hi> ii. p. 58.</p></note> The observations received from M. Von Siebold by M. Schlegel confirm the belief of other naturalists, that these reptiles, though assuredly dangerous from their poisonous qualities, are not of a highly ferocious nature. The former traveller fell in with vast numbers while sailing from Batavia to Japan, all of the small species, elsewhere so frequent and widely spread, known to naturalists by the specific name of <hi rend="italic">pelamys.</hi> Their movements were by no means rapid, although they glided through the water with grace and activity, raising their heads from time to time above the waves, for the purpose probably of respiration. Their motion is produced and directed by an action of the tail, accompanied by a lateral and undulating movement</p><p>of the other parts of the body. They were easily enough entrapped in wooden buckets, and glided through the sailors’ hands without attempting to bite them,—the said sailors having probably been previously informed that they were eels. “ Le Professeur Reinwardt,” says Schlegel, “confirme ce que M. von Siebold rapporte relativement au caractère doux et tranquille de ces animaux.”<note anchored="true" n="8" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Physiοg.</hi> ii. g. 493.</p></note> We cannot, however, help thinking that this alleged sweetness of temper and tranquillity are in some measure inconsistent with the cases of the native woman and Lascar already reported in our introductory observations. The comparatively slow movements also do not accord with what we are elsewhere informed by M. Lesson. “ Le 27 Juillet,” says that naturalist, “ par une journée brûlante, nous fûmes pris de calme sur les côtes de la Nouvelle Guinée. De nombreux serpens marins passèrent le long de la corvette, et un embarcation que le capitaine fit mettre à la mer nous permit de les chasser. Nous atteignîmes après de longues pursuites une Pelamide, dont l’agilité était extrème, et les mouvemens de natation des plus rapides.”<note anchored="true" n="9" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Loc. eit,</hi></p></note></p><p>We owe some interesting observations on the manners of these marine serpents to M. Peron,<note anchored="true" n="10" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">• Voyaye,</hi> p. 105 and 129. <hi rend="italic">Loc. cit.</hi></p></note> although it may be doubted whether that voyager did not occasionally take his notes from too great a distance, especially in reference to size and colour. No other credible author has ever described any of these species as attaining to so great a length as twelve feet ; the usual dimensions, we may here observe, varying from two and a half to five feet. However, M. Peron describes those he saw as gliding lightly in great numbers on the surface of the sea, and waging destructive war against a shoal of small herrings, which fled precipitately towards deeper water. The haunts of these snakes are by no means confined to the shallow shores, or even the vicinity of continents or islands, for they are often met with many hundred miles from land. On opening their stomach, our navigator found it filled with small fish, and various marine crustacea ; but the reptiles themselves became the frequent prey of sharks, in the interior of which their half-digested remains were often found. It naturally became a subject of surprise, that creatures so light and active should so often fall victims to an enemy of such weight and sluggishness ; but after more lengthened observation, a peculiarity in the habits of the former was thought sufficient to account for their capture. These serpents were often seen as if asleep, and floating on the waves, and so profound was their repose, that a large vessel, “ with all its bravery on,” might pass close by without their being disturbed by its surging prow, its huge furrow, or the loud voices of the garrulous sailors ( Frenchmen, of course). M. Peron supposes that it is in this state of lethargy that the lazy sharks swallow them at their leisure. As to the cause of the torpor itself, he naturally enough suggests that it may arise, as among the terrestrial races, from repletion, and the indolence indulged in by all serpents during the digestive process. “ Ces reptiles,” he adds, “ nagent et plongent avec une égale facilité : souvent à l’instant même où nous croyons pouvoir les saisir avec nos filets, ils disparaissaient à nos yeux ; et, s’enfonçant à de grandes profondeurs sous les flots, ils restaient une demiheure et plus sans remonter à leur surface, ou ne paraissaient qu’à de trés-grandes distances du point où nous les avions vus plonger.”<note anchored="true" n="11" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Loc. cit.</hi></p></note></p><p>The general ground-colour of the majority of these reptiles is yellowish, varying towards green, blue, or white, and often relieved by blackish rings, or broad lozengeshaped spots, disposed transversely along the dorsal re-<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0169.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s02-0150"/>
gion. The colours seem less subject to variation than among the other Ophidians, and there is no external difference between the sexes. All the species are included by M. Schlegel in the following genus.</p><p>Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Hydrophis.</hi> Head small, uniform with the trunk. Nostrils vertical, of an orbicular form, and capable of being closed by a valve. Eye small, pupil orbicular. Fangs but slightly developed, and always followed by several other teeth, solid though slender. Body tapering towards both extremities. Scales lozenge-shaped or hexagonal, not imbricated, covered by a thin epidermis, and surmounted by a tubercle, of which there are two on the median range of the abdomen. The abdominal scales scarcely larger than the others. Tail broad, flattened laterally, and performing the functions of an oar or rudder. Lungs often prolonged into a reservoir of air as far as the commencement of the caudal region.</p><p>Of this genus there are seven species, the particular characters of which we cannot here detail, although their general attributes may be made out from the preceding observations. See Plate CCCCXLIV. fig. 4.</p><p>The most common kind is <hi rend="italic">Hyd. pelamys</hi> of Oken<note anchored="true" n="12" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Naturgesch.</hi> vol. iii. part ii. p. 279.</p></note> <hi rend="italic">(Anguis piatura,</hi> Linn.), of a comparatively thickish form, the head much elongated, the median line of the abdomen indicated by a suture formed by two rows of scales. It is of a blackish brown above, beneath yellow ; the tail, and sometimes the entire body, varied by these colours. It is the most extensively distributed of the genus, being found wherever any sea-snakes occur. It seems to be the black backed hydrus of Shaw <hi rend="italic">(Hydrus bicolor,</hi> Schneid.); and in India rejoices in the euphonious name of <hi rend="italic">Nalla Wahlagdlee Pam.</hi><note anchored="true" n="13" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">» Indian Serpents,</hi> i. 47, pl. 41.</p></note> <hi rend="italic superscript"> i</hi> Of general occurrence in the Asiatic seas, it is also common round the coasts of Otaheite, where it is relished as an article of food, and known under the title of <hi rend="italic">Etoοnatoree.</hi></p><p><hi rend="italic">Family III.—Poisonous Serpents properly so called.</hi></p><p>The species of this family are the most venomous of all, and may, for the most part, be recognised by something especially repulsive and forbidding in their aspect. Their form is rather thick and heavy, their tail short, their head extremely broad, depressed, and somewhat heart-shaped ; rarely protected by plates, but usually covered by scales resembling those of the dorsal region ; the eyes are small, deeply seated in the sides of the head, and shaded by projecting superciliary plates, the pupil vertical ; the upper lip is inflated, and falls over the lengthened fangs ; the body is usually beset by scales of a lanceolated form, surmounted by a ridge, except in one or two species of Trigonocephalus, in which they arc smooth.</p><p>Their habits and modes of life likewise present some disparities when compared with those of the preceding groups. Being of a lethargic nature and slow of movement, they seldom wander about in search of prey, but keep themselves coiled up till it approaches closely, and then springing upon it by a sudden straightening of the body, they inflict a fatal wound, which needs no repetition. There seems reason to believe that this mode of attack is peculiar to the present family, the other poisonous kinds pursuing their prey, and <hi rend="italic">holding on</hi> when they have seized it, while the poisonous serpents properly so called are satisfied by sinking their envenomed fangs into the flesh of their victim. Their gape is very wide, their hooks long and sharp, their poison abundant and in a state of high concentration, and the wound is inflicted suddenly,</p><p>with great force. The result is left to nature, and is in consequence both sure and speedy.</p><p>We have said that the poison-fangs are more developed than among the other Ophidians. They alone occupy the maxillaries, being never followed by any small solid teeth, though these occur along the palate and at the extremity of the lower jaw. The nostrils are in some spacious, in others narrow, and vary also in their position. They are followed in certain species by a deep pit or hollow, scooped in the sides of the muzzle, and connected with a broad cavity in the upper maxillaries. This character (of which, however, we know not the function) seems analogous in some measure to the <hi rend="italic">larmiers</hi> of ruminating quadrupeds, and has been employed for the distribution of these serpents into several groups. Such as are distinguished by this nasal pit inhabit the forests of tropical countries, and consist of two genera, <hi rend="italic">Trigonocephalus</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Crotalus,</hi> of which the former (native both to Asia and America) is chiefly found in moist and sombre woods, or places covered by an abundant vegetation ; while the latter (peculiar to the western world) prefers a somewhat drier and more barren soil. Such as possess no nasal excavation are comprized in the genus <hi rend="italic">Viperus.</hi> They affect a more open, sandy soil, and occur exclusively in the ancient continents and New Holland. We shall briefly survey these different groups, in the order now named.</p><p>Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Trigonocephalus.</hi> Head, as in other members of the family, heart-shaped or triangular, extremely broad behind, and consequently very distinguishable from the neck. Tail terminated by a conical corneous plate.</p><p>The poison apparatus of these reptiles is developed in the highest degree ; and as the species sometimes attain a length of five or six feet, they may be regarded as among the most redoubtable of venomous serpents. They all frequent wooded or shady situations, or moist meadows in the immediate vicinity of forest-land. The abdomen is always broad, rather convex, and furnished with plates, which vary, according to the species, from 140 to about 270. The tail is always short, conical, and usually somewhat slender. The sub-caudal plates vary from forty to seventy ; and of these some are simple, others divided into two. The body is often marked by large irregular or lozenge-shaped spots upon a brownish or yellowish ground. Some, however, are reddish, others of a greenish hue, and there is frequently a line of deeper hue behind the eye. The species are rare in collections. None occur in Europe or Africa. America and the intertropical countries of Asia produce a large majority. the genus is divisible into two sections, according as the head is covered with scales or with plates.</p><p>One of the most noted species of the first section is <hi rend="italic">Trig, lanceolarus,</hi> a native of the West Indies.<note anchored="true" n="14" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Quad.

A broad brown line, bordered with white, proceeds from the eye towards the mouth. We have a good account of the habits and history of this reptile from Colonel Moreau de Jonnès.<note anchored="true" n="15" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">du Trigοnοcéphale des Antilles.</hi></p></note> He tells us of one killed by an officer which measured above seven feet and a half in length ; and still greater (but perhaps less accurate) measurements are given by Dutertre<note anchored="true" n="16" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist.

In the adult state they prey chiefly on rats, which, though not indigenous to these islands, are now in all probability as 10,000 to one compared with the native quadrupeds. The snakes in question<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0170.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s02-0151"/>
have also multiplied prodigiously in St Lucia and Martinique, where from sixty to eighty may be killed during the cutting of a single field of sugar-cane. According to M. Moreau de Jonnès, they people the marshes, the cultivated grounds, the forests, the banks of rivers, and even the summits of the mountains. The observer just named encountered one on the very edge of the crater of that naked mountain which overhangs the town of St Pierre, in Martinique, at an elevation of more than 5000 feet ; and he feared it the more from the excessive lassitude under which he himself at that time laboured. His alarm was not without cause, for only a few days before, a fisherman at the foot of the mountain had been attacked by a similar reptile, which issued from its concealment among the basalts of the shore, and no efforts could save his life. These dreaded serpents arc sometimes found in holes made by rats or land- crabs. They also enter hen-r∞sts and poultry-yards, and sometimes creep into dwelling-houses, chiefly, however, the huts of the negroes. But the sugar-plantations are their favourite places of resort. “Je n’ai jamais trouvé,” says our author, “ de serpent stationnaire, qu’il ne fût dans une <hi rend="italic">position offensive.</hi> L’action par laquelle le reptile prend cette position, s’exprimer aux Antilles par le verbe <hi rend="italic">lover.</hi> Elle consiste à contourner en spirale toute la longueur de son corps, qui forme quatre cercles egaux en diamètre, superposés les uns au dessus des autres, et sous le dernier duquels la queue est placée comme point central d’appui, de resort et de pivot. La tête, qui termine le cercle superior, est retirée en arrière. Quand l’animal s’élance sur une proie, il fait effort sur la queue, et déroule subitement les quatre cercles qui semblent se débander.” This species preys on birds as well as quadrupeds, and the former manifest their hatred by vain and clamorous cries whenever they behold their “ arch destroyer.” It avoids the brilliant equatorial light, and usually dwells in shaded places, seeking what it may devour chiefly towards sunset, or during cloudy weather.<note anchored="true" n="18" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Μonοgraphie,</hi> p. 37.</p></note> The distribution of this species is rather remarkable. It does not extend throughout the whole of the Antilles, nor is it found even in the majority of those islands. “ By a chance equally singular, fortunate, and inexplicable, it is confined to the islands of Martinique, St Lucia, and Be- conia alone ; and there is no proof, as has been pretended, that it is common in the American continent. Nevertheless, a tradition exists among the Indigenes, that it was introduced into Martinique by the Arronages, a horde which inhabited near the mouth of the Orinoco, and which, impelled by sentiments of hatred and vengeance against the Carribs of that island, made them this fatal present, and let loose in their forests this serpent, which was brought over in calabashes. But according to another popular opinion in the</p><p>same country, the Trigonocephalus is aboriginal of Martinique, and cannot live elsewhere, not even in Guadaloupe.</p><p>Some, however, think differently, and explain the phenomenon by the existence of the dog-headed serpent, which is believed to be a Boa, and which, common in Dominica and St Vincent, has delivered these islands from the Trigonocephalus.”<note anchored="true" n="19" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p>Griffith’s <hi rend="italic">Animal Kingdom,</hi> is. 350.</p></note></p><p>Of the second section of this genus, comprising such ns have the head covered by plates instead of scales, we may here name <hi rend="italic">Trig, rhodοstoma,</hi> which is of a thicker and more vigorous form than the other species. The body tapers towards either end, the tail is short and acuminated, the abdomen broad, and the back prolonged into a well- marked keel. The colour is reddish brown, paler on the back, the sides adorned by broad, deep, triangular spots, the abdomen white. The summit of the head is black, surrounded by a broad streak of pale red, which descends the sides of the neck to combine with the beautiful rose- colour which tinges the lateral parts of the head, and from which it is separated by a black band proceeding from behind the eye. The iris is of a golden yellow. “ L’expression sauvage de sa physiognomie,” says M. Schlegel, “ est, pour ainsi dire, adoucie par la nature et la conformation des plaques écailleuses qui semblables à celles de la plupart des couleuvres, ont la surface unie et luisante.”<note anchored="true" n="20" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Phys, des Serpens,</hi> ii. 547.</p></note> This species inhabits the western parts of Java, where it conceals itself in tangled vegetation, and makes its way at times into fields and gardens.

Khul’s residence at Buitenzorg, two labourers bitten by it died in five minutes. Although a viviparous reptile, the foetus is enclosed in a coriaceous envelope, as large as a pigeon’s egg.

Constrictor</hi> of America is usually described as of different habits and much larger dimensions. It is the black <hi rend="italic">snake</hi> of Catesby (Car. ii. pl. 48). “ This,” observes that author, “ is a large and very long snake, some being six feet in length. They</p><p>are all over of a shining black, never changing their colour, and are very nimble amd beneficial in killing rats, which they pursue with wonderful agility to the roofs and all parts of houses and barns, where rats are able to run, for which service they are preserved by most of the inhabitants.

It is certain most or all snakes will devour one another, not only of their own, but of other kinds, which I have often seen; one, after a long struggle, swallowing another but little leas than itself. They are the most numerous of all snakes." “ Many ridiculous frights,” says Mr Pennant, “ have happened from this <hi rend="italic">innocent</hi> reptile. As every one in America is full of the dread of the rattle-snake, they are apt to fly at the sight of any of the serpent kind. This pursues, soon overtakes, and twisting round the legs of the fugitive, soon brings him to the ground ; but he happily receives no hurt, but what may result from the fright.

by a peculiar organ called the rattle, or prolonged into a sharpened point. There are four species, all peculiar to America. These are often confounded, even by systematic writers ; and it is by no means easy to apply the general attributes assigned by travellers to the proper species, which no doubt differ from each other.</p><p>It seems ascertained, however, that the bite of all these reptiles is extremely dangerous, the slightest prick of their envenomed fangs, in any part of the body well supplied with blood-vessels, being sufficient to kill almost any animal. Laurenti says, that a person bitten by a Crotalus experiences a swelling of the entire body, the tongue becomes prodigiously inflamed, an unextinguishable thirst takes place, the edges of the wound become gangrened, and the unfortunate victim dies in frightful agony in five or six minutes. Different experiments made in Carolina by Captain Hall, are related in the Philosophical Transactions. A rattlesnake, four feet long, was fastened to a stake, and being made to bite three dogs, the first died in less than a quarter of a minute ; the second, in convulsions, in about two hours ; the third in about three hours. Four days after this, another dog was bitten by the same snake, and died in half a minute ; and then a second received the murderous fangs, and died in four minutes. A common black snake, about three feet long, and very vigorous, was next procured. The reptiles bit each other,—the black snake dying in eight minutes, the rattle-snake not seeming in any way affected by its wound. Proceeding upon the supposition that “ none but itself could be its parallel,” it was then made to inflict a bite on its own body, and this suicidal deceit was followed by the hoped-for consequence,—it died in less than twelve minutes. The story is probably well known to all, though not credited by so many, of a disagreeable kind of an heirloom which once existed in an American family. A man had been bitten through his boots by a rattle-snake, and died. The boots afterwards descended into the successive possession of two other persons, and killed them both,—an envenomed fang having remained sticking in the leather. As usual, we have contradictory accounts of the effects of corresponding causes. We know that an Englishman who was unfortunately bitten by a rattle-snake at Rouen, in 1827, expired in eight hours; yet in the April of that same year, at a meeting of the Academy of Sciences in Paris, Professor Bosc declared that he had <hi rend="italic">seen</hi> more than thirty persons who had been bitten by rattle-snakes, not one of whom had died. According to Kalm, even the largest animals, such as horses and oxen, die almost instantly. Dogs longer resist this fatal action. Most animals exhibit an instinctive horror on nearing one of these deathdealing creatures. “ I have often,” says M. Bosc, “ amused myself by trying to force my horse and dog to approach one of these animals. But they would sooner have allowed themselves to be knocked down upon the spot than have come near them.” Yet Mr Audubon informs us that the mocking-bird of America, so strong and overpowering is the instinct of parental love, docs not hesitate to attack the rattle-snake when it approaches too near its nest,—that it will strike it on the head, pick out its eyes, and eventually put it to death.</p><p>The so-called <hi rend="italic">rattle</hi> of these reptiles consists of a series of hollow, vertically flattened, scaly pieces, of which the posterior portion of one fits into the anterior portion of that which follows. They are thus mechanically and somewhat loosely connected together, without being actually joined, so that when shaken they make a rattling or rustling noise, resembling that produced by rumpled parchment. When young there is at first but a single horny portion at the end of the tail, and attached to the last caudal verte</p><p>bra. Another is formed on the renewal of the skin, pushing its predecessor onwards, so that the first joint, which is closed at the end, continues to be the terminal one. M. Bosc is of opinion that an additional joint is formed every year, and that if the parts in question were not so often broken off accidentally, we might thus determine the age of each individual. They are, however, extremely fragile ; and M. Palisot de Beauvois informs us, that he frequently found these rattles lying detached, in the course of his travels in the United States.<note anchored="true" n="24" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Latreille, <hi rend="italic">Reptiles,</hi> vi. 73.</p></note> Their amount sometimes exceeds thirty, but usually ranges from one to thirteen. Some say that the noise may be heard at the distance of a hundred feet, while Bosc and others allege that it is scarcely audible beyond some twelve or fifteen paces. We shall now briefly notice the different species, the names of which, as already hinted, have been frequently transposed by naturalists.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Crotalus horridus</hi> inhabits South America, and is known to the Portuguese by the name of <hi rend="italic">Carcavela.</hi> Its muzzle is covered by three or four pairs of plates. The scales, which are lozenge-shaped, and surmounted by a cutting keel, are disposed in twenty-nine ranges. Abdominal plates 145, sub-caudal twenty-five. The colour of the upper parts is yellowish brown, relieved upon the back by a range of broad, lozenge-shaped spots. This species measures from four to six feet in length, and, dwelling in a sultry clime, continues in a state of activity throughout the year. Some singular peculiarities in its manners are narrated by naturalists. For example, M. Palisot de Beauvois states, that during one of his journeys he observed a rattle-snake lying on the path, and approached it as quietly as possible. When he was about to strike it, it sprung its rattle, opened its mouth very widely, and received into its throat five young ones, each as thick as a goose’s quill. After ten minutes’ time, believing itself to be out of danger, it opened its mouth, and allowed the exit of the young, which, however, re-entered on a fresh alarm. This curious fact has been testified (if not confirmed) by another French gentleman, M. Guillemart.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Crotalus durissus</hi> (Plate CCCCXLHI. figs. 6 and 10) is a more northern species than the preceding, and to it we may refer the numerous observations which have been made by travellers and tourists on the rattle-snakes of North America. It seems to inhabit from the southern side of the Great Lakes as far as Mexico and California, extending westwards to the foot of the Rocky Mountains, but not occurring to the north of the river St Lawrence. It has only one or two pair of plates upon the muzzle, and the keel upon the scales is less developed ; the eyes are smaller, the tints deeper, the spots frequently assume the form of bands, and the tail is black. Abdominal plates 170, sub-caudal twenty-two. As this species dwells in districts subjected during winter to the influence of rigorous cold, it creeps in autumn into covered places, or, hiding itself beneath masses of sphagnum, falls into a state of lethargic repose. An individual killed by M. Bosc, and which did not measure more than four feet in length, was found to have a hare in its interior. Its usual food consists of rats, squirrels, and other small Rodentia. This serpent, commonly called the striped rattle-snake, is said to traverse rivers, and even lakes, by inflating its body like a bladder. “ The largest rattle-snake,” says Catesby, alluding to one or other of these species, “which I ever saw, was about eight feet in length, and weighing between eight and nine pounds. This monster was sliding into the house of Colonel Blake of Carolina, and had certainly taken up his abode there undisturbed, had not the domestic animals alarmed the family with their repeated outcries ; the hogs, dogs, and poultry united in their hatred to him, showing the greatest consternation, by erecting their<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0172.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s02-0153"/>
bristles and feathers, and expressing their wrath and indignation, surrounded him, but carefully kept their distance, while he, regardless of their threats, glided slowly along.” “ It is not uncommon,” he adds, “ to have them come into houses; a very extraordinary instance of which occurred to myself in the same gentleman’s house, in the month of February 1723. The servant, in making the bed in a ground room (but few minutes after I left it), on turning down the sheets, discovered a rattle-snake coiled between the sheets in the middle of the bed.” According to M. Audubon, the skin of this species is used in making shoes.<note anchored="true" n="25" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Edinburgh New Phil.

A black rabbit was then introduced, which it bit instantaneously, and the victim was dead in eight minutes.<note anchored="true" n="27" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">’ Isis,</hi> 1828, p. 1132.</p></note></p><p><hi rend="italic">Crotalus miliaris</hi> is a small species of North America, recognisable by its head clothed with nine well-developed plates. The eyes are large, the general colour a reddish brown, with three ranges of deeper spots. There are twenty-three rows of scales, and the lower plates are, abdominal 131, sub-caudal twenty-six. This snake was observed by Catesby in Carolina, and is described by Mr Say (under the title of <hi rend="italic">cror. tergeminus)</hi> as an inhabitant of those lonely sterile plains which stretch between the Mississippi and the Rocky Mountains. It is regarded as more dangerous than the preceding ; its small size and peculiar colour prevent its attracting notice, and its rattle is too feeble to be heard at any distance. People are thus apt to tread or even to sit down upon it unawares, and the consequences are as easily imagined as described. It lives on frogs and insects, is by no means timid, but is easily killed by the slightest blow. It was figured long ago both by Seba<note anchored="true" n="28" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Thesaurus,</hi> ii. pl. 95.</p></note> and Catesby.<note anchored="true" n="29" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Carolina,</hi> pl. 42.</p></note> <hi rend="superscript"> a</hi></p><p>Lastly, <hi rend="italic">Crotalus mutus</hi> differs from the other species in having the tail terminated by a hardened point instead of rattle. Its head is clothed with scales. The back is keeled, and the scales are surmounted by a tubercular ridge. Abdominal plates 227, sub-caudal forty-nine. This great serpent inhabits Cayenne, Essequibo, Surinam, and other parts of South America. It sometimes measures above ten feet in length, and may be regarded as the most gigantic of all poisonous reptiles. In its mode of life it somewhat resembles <hi rend="italic">Trigonοcephalus</hi> (and is in fact described as a species of that genus by Baron Cuvier<note anchored="true" n="30" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">∙ Trig, rhombifer, Règne Animal,</hi> ii. 90.</p></note> <hi rend="superscript"> β</hi>). But it is essentially a rattle-snake, though destitute of the particular part from which these species derive their general name. It seems the same as that described under the title of <hi rend="italic">Curucucu</hi> by Marcgrav.<note anchored="true" n="31" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Hist. Rerum Nat.

They inhabit either open sandy plains, or desert heaths, where the vegetation is not umbrageous. Hence their abundance in</p><p>Africa, and their comparative scarcity in other countries. None occurs in America, a few are found in the drier districts of Asia, three inhabit Europe, and one (of a somewhat anomalous nature) is native to New Holland.</p><p>The common viper of Great Britain, and of most parts of the Continent (<hi rend="italic">Vipera bents,</hi> Daudin— <hi rend="italic">coluber berus,</hi> Linn.),<note anchored="true" n="33" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Vip. kerns</hi> of Cuvier, and of some other French naturalists, seems to be identical with the aspic, <hi rend="italic">vipera asρis,—</hi> a species common in * rance and Switzerland.</p></note> * is the most poisonous of European reptiles. It rarely exceeds two feet in length. The upper portion of the head is protected by a few plate-like scales, somewhat larger than the others. The usual colour is pale ashy brown above, with a space between the eyes, and a patch on each side of the occiput, deep brown or black. A zigzag band of black (composed in some of confluent spots) extends along the back from the nape to the tail ; and there is also a parallel row of small black spots on each side. The abdomen and sub-caudal region are steel-blue, sometimes marbled by a yellowish tint, sometimes uniform, or nearly black. The abdominal plates are about a hundred and forty-five,—the sub-caudal about thirty-five. This species is widely spread over the central and northern parts of Europe, but some uncertainty prevails regarding the so-called common viper of Italy and other southern regions. M. Gistl describes the viper of the environs of Munich as having an upturned snout,<note anchored="true" n="34" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">” Isis for</hi> 1829, p. 1971.</p></note> which is a character of the aspic; and although Metaxa enumerates <hi rend="italic">Vipera bents</hi> and its varieties as occurring in the Roman territories,<note anchored="true" n="35" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic superscript"> n</hi> <hi rend="italic">Monograph of the Serpents of the Environs of Rome,</hi> p. 42.</p></note> " others are of opinion that all its alleged localities are doubtful beyond the Alps.<note anchored="true" n="36" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic superscript"> u</hi> <hi rend="italic">Physiog. des Serpens,</hi> ii. 597.</p></note> It seems, however, to be found in the temperate parts of Siberia, in Russia, Hungary, all Germany, parts of France, Holland, Denmark, Sweden, and, we believe, Norway. Though common in Great Britain, and many of the western isles of Scotland, it is not indigenous in Ireland. ' Its vertical as well as horizontal range is considerable, for although it affects the low wide heaths of Groninguen, Overyssel, and Friesland, it also occurs on the summit of the Inselberg in Thuringia, at an elevation of nearly three thousand feet above the level of the sea. The viper preys chiefly on mice and insects. A specimen, on the tail of which we inadvertently tramped while crossing a moor in Glenmuick, and which our friend Dr Greville struck down with his umbrella, was found on dissection to have a large field-mouse in its abdomen.</p><p>The bite of this reptile is seldom fatal to animals of moderate size. We have several times seen sporting dogs bitten by vipers on the Scotch moors ; and although the cheek might swell, and a heaviness of spirits, and disinclination to distant ranging, usually ensued for a few hours, no perceptible effect could be traced on the following day. A sparrow, however, or even a pigeon, dies in a few minutes after being bitten. Sheep usually escape without any scri- ous consequences. Fontana ascertained, that the hundredth part of a grain of poison was sufficient to kill a sparrow, and that a pigeon required six times that amount. From these data he made a calculation, that it would take nearly three grains to kill a man, and as a viper does not carry above two grains of poison in its vesicles, and does not entirely exhaust that quantity, even after many bites, it was concluded that a human being might receive the bite of five or six vipers without dying in consequence. Now this may be all accurately reasoned in its way, but as physiology is by no means a science of calculation, we would not advise any one to try the experiment- Several facts have been recently adduced to prove, that the bite of this reptile is frequently dangerous, and occasionally fatal. Dr Paulet, in his obser-<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0173.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s02-0154"/>
vations on the viper of Fontainebleau, states, that an infant of seven years and a half, which was bitten beneath the internal malleolus of the right foot, died at the end of seventeen hours,—while another infant, of only two years, which was bitten in the cheek, took two days to die. Dr Hervez de Chegoni mentions the case of a woman, aged sixty-five years, in good health, and of a sound constitution, who having been bitten in the thigh only once by a single viper, expired under the most deplorable symptoms in thirty-seven hours.</p><p>The aspic, <hi rend="italic">Vipera aspis,</hi> is a species nearly allied to the preceding, of which it is by some regarded as a variety, and of which it seems to assume the place in the south-western countries of Europe, extending as far as the island of Sicily.<note anchored="true" n="37" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> ,</hi> Although the title of <hi rend="italic">Aspic</hi> has been applied to this species, it is not the reptile so named in ancient days, which was not a European specie», but more probably the <hi rend="italic">Naja haje</hi> of Africa.</p></note> Its form is more slender, its head larger, its top covered by irregularly formed scales, and the muzzle is slightly turned up. The aspic is the species which served the experiments of Redi, Charas, and Fontana. It inhabits the dry and rocky countries of Italy, has been observed in Switzerland, and is common in France from the 49th degree of north latitude, spreading into Savoy, the Pyrenees, and the Mediterranean shores. It is the viper of Fontainebleau, and is also found in the forest of Montmorency; but in Burgundy, and the more northern parts of France, it is replaced by our common viper.</p><p>New Holland produces a rare and remarkable species, which some class as generically distinct, under the title of <hi rend="italic">Acanthophis.</hi> It is of a thickened form, with a slender hard-pointed tail, the upper part of the head protected by nine plates.

But there still remains the singular genus <hi rend="italic">Cæcilia,</hi> with which Baron Cuvier concludes his classification of Ophidian reptiles, although other naturalists, both prior to and since the publication of his latest system,<note anchored="true" n="41" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Règne Animal,</hi> 2d ed. 1629.</p></note> have arranged it in the Batrachian order, or have even raised it, with the other constituents of that order, to the rank of a distinct and separate class, called <hi rend="smallcaps">Αμρηιβιa.</hi><note anchored="true" n="42" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="superscript"> s</hi> The separation above alluded to, although first precisely expressed by the word <hi rend="italic">class,</hi> in the writings of M. de Blainville, and subsequently followed in our own country by Messrs Gray, Bell, &amp;c. had been practically effected by several other authors at an earlier period. M.

It will be perceived that this system differs chiefly from those now enounced, in the placing of two very peculiar American genera,— <hi rend="italic">Menopoma</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Amphiuma,</hi> characterized by the absence of gills,—in a separate order, termed <hi rend="smallcaps">Abhanchia,</hi> from the presumed peculiarity just alluded to. The last-named arrangement is adopted by Mr Swainson, in <hi rend="italic">Cabinet Cyclopιvdia,</hi> vol. cxvi. pp. 83 and 339.</p></note> <hi rend="smallcaps">* As</hi> we have already discussed that so-called class in the article <hi rend="smallcaps">Reptilia</hi> of the present work (see <hi rend="italic">Encyc. Brit.</hi> vol. xix. p. 150), we shall here subjoin the characters of the anomalous reptiles just referred to, as given by the great French anatomist. They form, under the name of <hi rend="smallcaps">Naked Serpents</hi> <hi rend="italic">(Serpens nues),</hi> the third and concluding family of his Ophidian order.</p><p>Genus <hi rend="smallcaps">Cæcilia.</hi> Eyes extremely small, almost concealed beneath the skin, sometimes wanting. Skin smooth, viscous, furrowed by annular folds, apparently naked, but exhibiting in its thickness certain slender scales, regularly disposed on many transverse ridges between the wrinkles of the skin. Head depressed, anus nearly terminal, tail consequently short or almost wanting. Ribs too short to surround the trunk. Vertebrae articulated by facets like hollowed cones filled with gelatinous cartilage, as in fishes and some Batrachia ; the cranium united to the first vertebra by two tubercles, also as in Batrachian reptiles. The orbits, covered by the maxillary bones, are only pierced by a very small hole ; and the bones of the temples cover the temporal fossæ, in such a way that the head exhibits superiorly nothing but a continuous bony buckler. (See Plate CCCCXLIII. fig. 1 <hi rend="italic">d.)</hi> The hyoid bone, composed of three pair of arches, is so constructed as almost to lead to the belief that in early age there were gills. The maxillary and palatine teeth are ranged on two concentric lines, as in the genus Proteus, but are frequently sharp and curved backwards, as in true serpents. The nostrils open at the back part of the palate, and the lower jaw has no moveable pedicle, the tympanic bone being encased with the other<pb facs="chi.28490924-1526168109_Page_0174.jpf" xml:id="eb07-20-s02-0155"/>
bones in the buckler of the cranium. The auricle of the heart is not sufficiently divided to be described as double ; but the second lung is rudimentary, as among the genuine Ophidians. The liver is divided into many transverse foliations.</p><p>We know nothing of the natural history or habits of the animals of this genus. They are said to dwell in marshy ground, several feet below the surface. They probably prey on worms and insects, although vegetable matters, mould, and sand, have been found in their intestines.</p><p>In certain species the muzzle is obtuse, the skin loose, the folds conspicuous, and there are two small hairs near the nostrils. To this section belongs <hi rend="italic">Cæc</hi>. <hi rend="italic">annulata</hi> of Spix, a Brazilian species, of subterranean habits. It is of a blackish hue, with upwards of eighty annular folds, and</p><p>circularly marked with white. The teeth are conical. Others have the folds more numerous, or rather in the form of serrated transverse striæ. Such is <hi rend="italic">Cæc. glutinosa,</hi> Linn., from Ceylon, a blackish-coloured reptile, marked by a longitudinal band of white on either side, and characterized by 350 folds, which unite beneath in an acute angle. We have figured a nearly allied species from America, <hi rend="italic">Cæc</hi>. <hi rend="italic">bivittata</hi> of the French naturalists (see Plate CCCCXLIV. fig. 3). Finally, a few have the folds almost effaced, the body long and slender, and the muzzle projecting. <hi rend="italic">Cæc</hi>. <hi rend="italic">lumbricoides,</hi> Daudin,<note anchored="true" n="43" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic superscript"> ,</hi> <hi rend="italic">Reptiles,</hi> viii.

Baron Cuvier possessed the skeleton of a Cæcilia more than six feet long.<note anchored="true" n="44" place="bottom" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">* Règnt Animal,</hi> ii. 10l, notc.</p></note> * There were 225 vertebræ, but the external characters were unknown.
