(or HARO) ISLANDS, an archipelago (San Juan, Orcas, Shaw, Lopez, Blakely, Cypress, &amp;c.) lying between Vancouver Island and the mainland of North America, which were for many years the subject of dispute between the British and the United States Governments, and were finally assigned to the latter country by the arbitration of the emperor of Germany (21st October 1872). Geographically the cluster certainly belongs to the mainland, from which it is separated by Rosario Channel, generally much under 50 fathoms in depth, while Haro Strait, separating it from Vancouver Island, has depths ranging from 100 to 190 fathoms. In 1873 the islands, formerly considered part of Whatcom county, Washington Territory, were made the separate county of San Juan. Of the total area of 200 square miles, about 60 are in San</p><p>Juan, 60 in Orcas, and 30 in Lopez. The population was 554 in 1870 and 948 in 1880.</p><p>See <hi rend="italic">Papers relating to the Treaty of Washington,</hi> vol. v., 1872, and the map in Petermannâ€™s <hi rend="italic">Mittheilungen,</hi> 1873.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
