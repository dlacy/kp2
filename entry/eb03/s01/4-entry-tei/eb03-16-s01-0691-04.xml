the <hi rend="smallcaps">Beetle,</hi> in zoology, a genus of infects of the coleoptera order: the antennae of the beetles are of a clavated figure, and fiſſile longitudinally; and their legs are frequently dentated. There are 87 ſpecies; all, however, concurring in one common formation of having caſes to their wings, which are the more neceſſary to thoſe infects, as they often live under the ſurface of the earth, in holes, which they dig out by their own induſtry. The caſes prevent the various injuries their real wings might ſuſtain by rubbing or cruſhing againſt the ſides of their abode; Theſe, though they do not aſſiſt flight, yet keep the internal wings clean and even, and produce a loud buzzing noiſe when the animal riſes in the air.</p><p>It we examine the formation of all animals of the beetle kind, we ſhall find, as in ſhell fiſh, that their bones are placed externally, and their muſcles within. Theſe muſcles are formed very much like thoſe of quadrupeds; and are formed with ſuch ſurpriſing ſtrength, that, bulk for bulk, they are a thouſand times ſtronger than thoſe of a man. The ſtrength of theſe muſcles is of uſe in digging the animal’s ſubterraneous abode, whither it moſt frequently returns, even after it becomes a winged infect capable of flying.</p><p>Beſides the difference which reſults from the ſhape and colour oſ theſe animals, the ſize alſo makes a conſiderable one; ſome beetles being not larger than the<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0698.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0692"/>
head of a pin; while others, ſuch as the elephant beetle, are as big as one’s fiſt. But the greateſt difference among them is, that ſome are produced in a month, and in a ſingle ſeaſon go through all the ſtages of their exiſtence; while others take near four years to their production, and live as winged infects a year more.</p><p>The may-bug, dorr-beetle, or cock-chaffer, has, like all the reſt, a pair of cafes to its wings, which are of a reddiſh brown colour, ſprinkled with a whitiſh duſt, which eaſily comes off. In ſome years their necks are ſeen covered with a red plate, and in others with a black; theſe, however, are diſtinct ſorts, and their difference is by no means accidental. The fore legs are very ſhort, and the better calculated for burrowing in the ground, where this infect makes its retreat. It is well known, for its evening buzz, to children; but ſtill more formidably introduced to the acquaintance of the huſhandman and gardener, for in ſome ſeaſons it has been found to ſwarm in ſuch numbers as to eat up every vegetable production.</p><p>The two ſexes in the may-bug are eaſily diſtinguiſhed from each other, by the ſuperior length of the tufts, at the end of the horns, in the male. They begin to copulate in ſummer; and at that ſeaſon they are ſeen joined together for a conſiderable time. They fly about in this ſtate, the one hanging pendant from the tail of the other. It has been ſuppoſed, that, like ſnails, they are hermaphrodites, as there ſeems to be a mutual inſertion.</p><p>The female being impregnated, quickly falls to boring a hole into the ground, wherein to depoſit her burden. This is generally about half a foot deep; and in it ſhe places her eggs, which are of an oblong ſhape, with great regularity, one by the other. They are of a blight yellow colour, and no way wrapped up in a common covering, as ſome have imagined. When the female is lightened of her burden, ſhe again aſcends from her hole, to live, as before, upon leaves and vegetables, to buzz in the ſummer evening, and to lie hid among the branches of trees in the heat of the day.</p><p>In about three months after theſe eggs have been thus depoſited in the earth, the contained infect begins to break its ſhell, and a ſmall grub or maggot crawls forth, and feeds upon the roots of whatever vegetable it happens to be neareſt. All ſubſtances, of this kind, ſeem equally grateful; yet it is probable the mother infect has a choice among what kind of vegetables ſhe ſhall depoſit her young. In this manner theſe voracious creatures continue in the worm ſtate for more than three years, devouring the roots of every plant they approach, and making their way tinder ground in queſt of food with great diſpatch and facility. At length they grow to above the ſize of a walnut, being a great thick white maggot with a red head, which is ſeen moſt frequently in new turned earth, and which is ſo eagerly ſought after by birds of every ſpecies. When largeſt, they are found an inch and a half long, of a whitiſh yellow colour; with a body conſiſting of twelve ſegments or joints, on each fide of which there are nine breathing holes, and three red feet. The head is larger in proportion to the body, of a reddiſh colour, with a pincer before, and a ſemicircular lip, with which it cuts the roots of plants, and ſucks out their xnoiſture. As this inſect</p><p>lives entirely under ground, it has no occaſion for eyes <hi rend="italic">,</hi> and accordingly it is found to have none; but is furniſhed with two feelers, which, like the crutch of a blind man, ſerve to direct its motions. Such is the form of this animal, that lives for years in the worm ſtate under ground, ſtill voracious, and every year changing its ſkin.</p><p>It is not till the end of the fourth year that this extraordinary infect prepares to emerge from its ſubterraneous abode, and even this is not effected but by a tedious preparation. About the latter end of autumn, the grub begins to perceive the approaches of its transformation: it then buries itſelf deeper and deeper in the earth, ſometimes ſix feet beneath the ſurface; and there forms itſelf a capacious apartment, the walls of which it renders very ſmooth and ſhining by the excretions of its body. Its abode being thus formed, it begins ſoon after to ſhorten itſelf, to ſwell, and to burſt its laſt ſkin in order to allume the form of a chryſalis. This, in the beginning, appears of a yellowiſh colour, which heightens by degrees, till at laſt it is ſeen nearly red. Its exterior form plainly diſcovers all the veſtiges of the future winged infect, all the fore parts being diſtinctly ſeen; while, behind, the animal ſeems as if wrapped in ſwaddling clothes.</p><p>The young may-bug continues in this ſtate for about three months longer; and it is not till the beginning of January that the aurelia diveſts itſelf of all its impediments, and becomes a winged infect completely formed. Yet ſtill the animal is far from attaining its natural ſtrength, health, and appetite. It undergoes a kind of infant imbecility; and unlike moſt other infects, that the inſtant they become flies are arrived at their ſtate of full perfection, the may-bug continues feeble and ſickly. Its colour is much brighter than in the perfect animal; all its parts are ſoft; and its voracious nature ſeems for a while to have entirely ſorſaken it. As the animal is very often found in this ſtate, it is ſuppoſed, by thoſe unacquainted with its real hiſtory, that the old ones, of the former ſeaſon, have buried themſelves for the winter, in order to reviſit the ſun the enſuing ſummer. But the fact is, the old one never ſurvives the ſeaſon; but dies, like all the other winged tribe of infects, from the ſeverity of cold in winter.</p><p>About the latter end of May, theſe infects, after having lived for four years under ground, burſt from the earth when the firſt mild evening invites them abroad. They are at that time ſeen riſing from their long impriſonment, from living only upon roots, and. imbibing only the moiſture of the earth, to viſit the mildneſs of the ſummer air, to chooſe the ſweeteſt vegetables for their banquet, and to drink the dew of the evening. Wherever an attentive obſerver then walks abroad, he will ſee them burſting up before him in his pathway, like ghoſts on a theatre. He will ſee every part of the earth, that had its ſurface beaten into hardneſs, perforated by their egreſſion. When the ſeaſon is favourable for them, they are ſeen by myriads buzzing along, hitting againſt every object that intercepts their flight. The mid-day ſun, however, ſeems too powerful for their conſtitutions: they then lurk under the leaves and branches of ſome ſhady tree; but the willow ſeems particularly their molt favourite food; there they lurk in cluſters, and ſeldom<pb facs="gri_33125011196389_0699.tif" xml:id="eb03-16-s01-0693"/>
quit the tree till they have devoured all its verdure. In thoſe ſeaſons which are favourable to their propagation, they are ſeen in an evening as thick as flakes of ſnow, and hitting againſt every object with a ſort of capricious blindneſs. Their duration, however, is but ſhort, as they never ſurvive the ſeaſon. They begin to join ſhortly after they have been let looſe from their priſon; and when the female is impregnated, ſhe cautiouſly bores a hole in the ground, with an inſtrument fitted for that purpoſe with which ſhe is furniſhed at the tail; and there depoſits her eggs, generally to the number of threeſcore. If the ſeaſon and the ſoil be adapted to their propagation, theſe ſoon multiply as already described, and go through the various ſtages of their contemptible exiſtence. This inſect, however, in its worm ſtate, though prejudicial to man, makes one of the chief repaſts of the feathered tribe, and is generally the firſt nouriſhment with which they ſupply their young. Hogs will root up the land for them, and at firſt eat them greedily; but ſeldom meddle with them a ſecond time. Rooks are particularly fond of theſe worms, and devour them in great numbers. The inhabitants of the county of Norfolk, ſome time ſince, went into the practice of deſtroying their rookeries; but in proportion as they deſtroyed one plague, they were peſtered with a greater; and theſe infects multiplied in ſuch an amazing abundance, as to deſtroy not only the verdure of the fields, but even the roots of vegetables not yet ſhot forth. One farm in particular was ſo injured by them in the year 1751, that the occupier was not able to pay his rent; and the landlord was not only content to loſe his income for that year, but alſo gave money for the ſupport of the farmer and his family. In Ireland they ſuffered ſo much by theſe infects, that they came to a reſolution of letting fire to a wood, of ſome extent, to prevent their miſchievous propagation.</p><p>“Neither the ſevereſt froſts in our climate (ſays Mr Rack), nor even keeping them in water, will kill them. I have kept ſome in water near a week<note anchored="false" n="1" place="margin" type="authorial"><p><hi rend="italic">Bath Papers,</hi> vol. i. p. 265</p></note>; they appeared motionleſs; but on expoſing them to the ſun and air a few hours, they recovered, and were as lively as ever. Hence it is evident they can live without air. On examining them with a microſcope, I could never diſcover any organs for reſpiration, or perceive any pulſation. When numerous, they are not deſtroyed without great difficulty; the beſt method is, to plough up the land in thin furrows, and employ children to pick them up in baſkets; and then ſtrew ſalt and quick-lime, and harrow in. About 30 years ſince I remember many farmers crops in Norfolk were almoſt ruined by them in their grub-ſtate; and in the next ſeaſon, when they took wing, the trees and hedges in many pariſſies were ſtripped bare of their leaves as in winter. At firſt the people uſed to bruſh them down with poles, and then ſweep them up and burn them. One farmer made oath that he gathered 80 buſhels; but their number ſeemed not much leſſened, except juſt in his own fields.”</p><p>The ſcarabaeus carnifex, which the Americans call the <hi rend="italic">tumble-dung,</hi> particularly demands our attention. It is all over of a duſky black, rounder than thoſe animals are generally found to be, and ſo ſtrong, though not much larger than the common black beetle, that if one of them be put under a braſs candleſtick, it will cauſe it to move backwards and forwards, as if it were by an</p><p>inviſible hand, to the admiration of thoſe who arc not accuſtomed to the ſight: but this ſtrength is given it for much more uſeful purpoſes than thoſe of exciting human curioſity; for there is no creature more laborious, either in ſeeking ſubſiſtence, or providing a proper retreat for its young. They are endowed with ſagacity to diſcover ſubfiſtence by their excellent ſmelling, which directs them in flights to excrements juſt fallen from man or beaſts, on which they inſtantly drop, and fall unanimouſly to work in forming round balls or pellets thereof, in the middle of which they lay an egg. Theſe pellets, in September, they convey three feet deep in the earth, where they lie till the approach of ſpring, when the eggs are hatched and burſt their neſts, and the infects find their way out of the earth. They aſſiſt each other with indefatigable induſtry in rolling theſe globular pellets to the place where they are to be buried. This they are to perform with the tail ſoremoſt, by raising up their hinder part, and ſhoving along the ball with their hind-feet. They are always accompanied with other beetles of a larger fize, and of a more elegant ſtructure and colour. The breaſt of this is covered with a ſhield of a crimſon colour, and ſhining like metal; the head is of the like colour, mixed with green; and on the crown of the head ſtands a ſhining black horn, bending backwards. Theſe are called the <hi rend="italic">kings of the beetles;</hi> but for what reaſon is uncertain, ſince they partake of the fame dirty drudgery with the reſt.</p><p>The <hi rend="italic">elephant-beetle</hi> is the largeſt of this kind hitherto known; and is found in South America, particularly in Guinea and Surinam, as well as about the river Oroonoko. It is of a black colour; and the whole body is covered with a very hard ſhell, full as thick and as ſtrong as that of a ſmall crab. Its length, from the hinder part to the eyes, is almoſt four inches; and from the fame part to the end of the proboſcis or trunk, four inches and three quarters. The tranſverſe diameter of the body is two inches and a quarter; and the breadth of each elytron, or cafe for the wings, is an inch and three-tenths. The antennæ or feelers are quite horny; for which reaſon the proboſcis or trunk is moveable at its inſertion into the head, and ſeems to ſupply the place of feelers; the horns are eight-tenths of an inch long, and terminate in points. The proboſcis is an inch and a quarter long, and turns upwards; making a crooked line, terminating in two horns, each of which is near a quarter of an inch long; hut they are not perforated at the end like the proboſcis of other infects. About four-tenths of an inch above the head, or that ſide next the body, is a prominence or ſmall horn; which, if the reſt ot the trunk were away, would cauſe this part to reſemble the horn of a rhinoceros. There is indeed a beetle ſo called; but then the horns or trunk has no fork at the end, though the lower horn reſembles this. The feet are all forked at the end, but not like lobſters claws.
