<p><span class="font0">Taking his enactments in the Code and his Novels together, we have of Justinian’s own legislation not far short of 600&nbsp;constitutions. Diocletian’s contributions to the Code&nbsp;are more than twice as numerous; but most of them&nbsp;professed to be nothing more than short declaratory&nbsp;statements of pre-existing law, whereas Justinian’s, apart&nbsp;from his Fifty Decisions, were mostly reformatory enactments, many of those in the Novels as long as an average act of&nbsp;parliament, and often dealing with diverse matters under the&nbsp;same rubric. They cover the whole field of law, public and&nbsp;private, civil and criminal, secular and ecclesiastical. It&nbsp;cannot be said that they afford pleasant reading: they are&nbsp;so disfigured by redundancy of language, involved periods and&nbsp;nauseous self-glorification. But it cannot be denied that many&nbsp;of those which deal with the private law embody reforms of&nbsp;great moment and of most salutary tendency. The emperor&nbsp;sometimes loved to pose as the champion of the simplicity&nbsp;and even-handedness of the early law, at others to denounce&nbsp;it for its subtleties; sometimes he allowed himself to be influenced by his own extreme asceticism, and now and again&nbsp;we detect traces of subservience to the imperious will of his&nbsp;consort; but in the main his legislation was dictated by what&nbsp;he was pleased to call </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">humanitas</span><span class="font0"> so far as the law of persons&nbsp;was concerned, and by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">naturalis ratio</span><span class="font0"> and public utility so far&nbsp;as concerned that of things. The result was the eradication of&nbsp;almost every trace of the old </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">jus Quir ilium,</span><span class="font0"> and the substitution&nbsp;for it, under the name of Jhs </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Romanum,</span><span class="font0"> of that cosmopolitan&nbsp;body of law which has contributed so largely to almost every</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">modern system.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">. Changes in the Law of the Family.</span><span class="font0">—With the Christian emperors, from Constantine downwards, almost the last traces disappeared of&nbsp;the old conception of the/ami/ia as an aggregate of persons&nbsp;and estate subject absolutely to the power and dominion&nbsp;of its head. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Manus,</span><span class="font0"> the power in a husband over his&nbsp;wife and her belongings, was a thing of the past; both&nbsp;stood now on a footing of equality before the law; perhaps it might&nbsp;be more accurate to say, at least with reference to the Justinianian&nbsp;legislation, that the wife was the more privileged of the two in respect&nbsp;both of the protection and the indulgence the law accorded her.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">With </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">manus</span><span class="font0"> the old. confarreation and coemption had ceased, marriage needing nothing more than simple interchange of.consent,&nbsp;except as between persons of rank </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{illustres)</span><span class="font0"> or when.the intention&nbsp;was to legitimate previous issue; in the latter case a written marriage&nbsp;settlement </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{instrumentum dotale)</span><span class="font0"> was required, and in the former&nbsp;both such a settlement and a marriage in church before the bishop&nbsp;and. at least three clerical witnesses, who granted and signed a&nbsp;certificate of the completed union. The legislation of.the Christian&nbsp;emperors on the subject of divorce, largely contributed to by&nbsp;Justinian in his Novels, has already been referred to. In regard&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dos,</span><span class="font0"> many new provisions were introduced,, principally, for&nbsp;curtailing the husband’s power of dealing with it while the marriage&nbsp;lasted, enlarging the right of the wife, and her heirs in respect of it,&nbsp;and simplifying the means of recovering it from the husband or his</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
<p><span class="font0">heirs when the marriage was dissolved. Between the time of Constantine and that of Theodosius and Valentinian a new form of&nbsp;matrimonial settlement became established, ft became apparently&nbsp;a legally sanctioned practice for a man to make (apart from ordinary&nbsp;marriage presents) a settlement on his intended wife cither by actual&nbsp;transfer or by promise of a provision which was to remain his&nbsp;property (though without the power of alienation) during the&nbsp;marriage, but to pass to her on his predecease or on divorce by his&nbsp;fault. This got the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">donatio ante nuptias,</span><span class="font0"> or sometimes, as&nbsp;being a sort of counterpart for the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dos, antipherna.</span><span class="font0"> There was&nbsp;some important legislation about it by the two last-mentioned&nbsp;emperors; Leo and Justin followed suit; and Justinian, in his&nbsp;Code and Novels, published five or six enactments for its regulation.&nbsp;The general result was that, wherever a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dos</span><span class="font0"> was given or promised on&nbsp;the part of the wife, there a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">donatio</span><span class="font0"> of equal amount was to be&nbsp;constituted on the part of the husband; that, if one was increased&nbsp;during the marriage, a corresponding increase was to be made to&nbsp;the other; that it might be constituted or increased after the&nbsp;marriage without infringing the rule prohibiting donations between&nbsp;husband and wife, which caused Justinian to change its name to&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">donatio propter nuptias;</span><span class="font0"> that the wife might demand its transfer to&nbsp;her (to tne same extent as she could that of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dos)</span><span class="font0"> on her husband’s&nbsp;insolvency, but under obligation to apply its income to the maintenance of the family; and that on the dissolution of the marriage&nbsp;by her husband's death or by a divorce for which he w<sup>f</sup>as in fault,&nbsp;she had an hypothec and other ample remedies for reducing it into&nbsp;possession.<sup>@@5</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The change in the complexion of the relations between husband and wife under the Christian emperors, however, was insignificant&nbsp;when compared with that w hich had overtaken the relation between&nbsp;parent and child. Justinian in his Institutes reproduces the boast&nbsp;of Gaius that nowhere else had a father such power over his children&nbsp;as was exercised by a Roman </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias.</span><span class="font0"> True it is that the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas</span><span class="font0"> in name still held a prominent place in the Justin-íanian collections; but it had been shorn of most.of the prerogatives&nbsp;that had characterized it in earlier periods. To expose a newborn&nbsp;child was forbidden under penalties. To take the life of a grownup one—unless it was a daughter slain with her paramour, in the&nbsp;act of adultery—was murder; for the domestic tribunal, with the&nbsp;judicial power of life and death in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> as its head, had&nbsp;long disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Further, a parent could no longer sell his child save only when the child was an infant and he in such extreme poverty as to be&nbsp;unable to support it. Even the right to make a noxal surrender&nbsp;of his son to a party who had suffered from the latter’s delict had&nbsp;silently become obsolete; so greatly had altered sentiment, in&nbsp;sympathy with, legislation, curtailed the power of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">over those in his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">potestas.</span><span class="font0"> This </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">noxae deditio</span><span class="font0"> was formally abolished&nbsp;by Justinian. All that remained of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">patria potestas,</span><span class="font0"> in short, in the&nbsp;Justinianian law was little more than would be sanctioned in most&nbsp;modern systems as natural emanations of the paternal relationship.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Thus he had right of moderate chastisement for offences (for the infliction of graver punishments he had to apply to the magistrate),&nbsp;of testamentary nomination of guardians, of pupillary substitution&nbsp;(enlarged by Justinian), and of withholding consent from the&nbsp;marriage, of a child, but subject in this last ease to magisterial&nbsp;intervention if used unreasonably.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">How the right of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> over the earnings and acquisitions of his children was modified by the recognition of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peculium castrense</span><span class="font0"> has been shown in a previous page. But the modification&nbsp;was carried to such an extent by.the Christian emperors as finally&nbsp;to negative the father’s ownership altogether, except as regarded&nbsp;acquisitions that were the outcome of funds advanced by him to his&nbsp;child for his separate use </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{peculium profecticium).</span><span class="font0"> Of some of the&nbsp;child's acquisitions </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">{bona. adventicia)</span><span class="font0"> his father had, down to.the&nbsp;time of Justinian, the life interest and right of administration;&nbsp;but by his legislation even these might be excluded at the pleasure&nbsp;of the parties from whom the acquisitions had been derived or by&nbsp;maladministration of the father.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">By the classical law the father’s radical right in his son’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peculium castrense</span><span class="font0"> revived on the latter’s death; for if he died intestate&nbsp;the former appropriated it not as his son’s heir, but as an owner&nbsp;whose powers as such had been merely temporarily suspended. But&nbsp;by one of the chapters in the famous 118th Novel on the law of&nbsp;intestate succession even this prerogative of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">paterfamilias</span><span class="font0"> was&nbsp;abolished, and all a child’s belongings except his </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">peculium profecticium</span><span class="font0"> were recognized as his own in death as.well as in life, so that&nbsp;if any of them should pass to his parent on his intestacy it should&nbsp;only be by title of inheritance and in the absence of descendants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In every other branch of the law of the family the same reforming spirit was manifested. Adoption of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">fUiifamilias</span><span class="font0"> was no longer&nbsp;followed in all cases by a change of family for the adoptee, but only&nbsp;when either the adopter was in fact one of his ancestors in whose</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div>
