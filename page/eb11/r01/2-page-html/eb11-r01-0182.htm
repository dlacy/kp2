<p><span class="font1">century of our era, though this system seems to have been lost sight of till re-invented by the Australians.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Again, in the Western states of America, where the climate is not hot and dry enough for stripping purposes, the method&nbsp;followed is to cut the straw as short as possible—just below the&nbsp;heads—and these fall on to a travelling canvas and are carried&nbsp;up into a thrasher and the grain separated and sacked as the&nbsp;work proceeds. An immense combined implement is used for&nbsp;this reaping and thrashing purpose, taking a width of up to&nbsp;40 ft. of crop at a time, and being propelled by a 50-horse-power&nbsp;traction engine running on broad roller-wheels, though smaller&nbsp;machines pulled by, say, 20 horses are also common. Sometimes the “ heading ’’ only is carried out, and the cut heads&nbsp;carried on a canvas up into a wagon travelled alongside, and&nbsp;then carted away for subsequent thrashing, the “ header ’’ thus&nbsp;being the form of reaper adopted also in the Western states of&nbsp;America. In these regions, as in many other places on the&nbsp;prairies in general, the straw is of no value, and therefore the&nbsp;whole is set fire to and burned off, thus returning a certain&nbsp;amount of fertility to the soil in the ashes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the normal and ordinary system of reaping with the string-binder in Great Britain the rule is to “ open up ” a field&nbsp;by cutting “ roads ’’ round it: that is, a headland or roadway&nbsp;is mowed by the scythe and tied up by hand. Then the string-binder is started to cut around and continued till a finish is&nbsp;made at the centre of the field. Sometimes the crop is partly&nbsp;lodged and can only be cut on three sides of the field, and the&nbsp;binder is “ slipped ” past the fourth side. It is customary in&nbsp;some parts to yoke three horses to the machine and keep these&nbsp;at work all day with an interval for the midday meal only, but&nbsp;a better plan is to allow two men and four horses to each, and&nbsp;put one couple on and one couple off for meals and resting&nbsp;alternately. By this means the binder is kept going continuously without any stoppage for perhaps 14 hours daily in&nbsp;fine harvest weather. With a six-feet cutting width an acre per&nbsp;hour is fair work, but some have exceeded that, especially with&nbsp;wider cutting widths. A ball of twine weighing 3 to 4 ℔ is&nbsp;the usual requisite per acre for binding the sheaves, and it ought&nbsp;to be of Manilla hemp: “ sizal ” fibre (derived from the American agaves and named after the port on the coast of Yucatan)&nbsp;is not so strong and good, though cheaper. Good twine is de-sirable, as otherwise frequent breakages leave many sheaves&nbsp;in a loose state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The sheaves are dropped off on to the ground as tied, but some farmers use the “ sheaf-carrier,” which catches these as&nbsp;they are shot out from the binding apparatus, and dumps them&nbsp;in lots of six or so—sufficient to make a stook or shock. The&nbsp;stooking—that is, the setting up of the sheaves on end to dry—&nbsp;is a separate operation, and from two to three men can set up an&nbsp;ordinary good crop as fast as the binder can cut it. In this work&nbsp;the sheaves are set with their butts wide apart and the heads&nbsp;leaning against one another like the two legs of the letter A :&nbsp;a full-sized stook or “ threave ” is 24 sheaves—a relic of the days&nbsp;when the crop was all hand-reaped by piecework at so much per&nbsp;threave—but in practice now seldom more than 6 sheaves (3&nbsp;each side) are put to each stook. When sufficiently dried or&nbsp;“ fielded ” the sheaves are then carried by cart or wagon to the&nbsp;stackyard, where they are built up sheaf by sheaf into round or&nbsp;oblong stacks: that is, they are stored until required for thrashing or foddering purposes. The drying may be a tedious affair,&nbsp;and wet weather in harvest time is a national disaster from the&nbsp;spoiling of the corn, both grain and straw.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The tremendous development in labour-saving in the matter of reaping the corn crops is well exemplified in a comparison of&nbsp;harvesting with the hand hook or sickle as compared with the&nbsp;string-binder. With hand-reaping six men (or women) cut the&nbsp;corn and laid it on the bands in sheaf-lots: one man came behind&nbsp;and tied the sheaves and set them up in stooks. Thus a gang of&nbsp;seven worked together and harvested about two acres per day.&nbsp;With the binder three or four men handle say twelve or fourteen&nbsp;acres daily: in other words, there is only one-tenth of the manual&nbsp;labour required now in reaping that was necessary only a genera-tion ago, for the string-binder has revolutionized farming as a&nbsp;whole, and given the nations cheap bread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(P.

<p><span class="font1">REAR, the back or hind portion of anything, particularly a military or naval term for that part of a force which is placed&nbsp;last in order, in opposition to “ van.” As the last word,&nbsp;shortened from “ van-guard,” is an aphetic form of Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">avant,</span><span class="font1"> in&nbsp;front, Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ab ante,</span><span class="font1"> so “ rear ” is an aphetic form of “ arrear,”&nbsp;O. Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arere,</span><span class="font1"> mod. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arrière,</span><span class="font1"> Med. Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ad retro,</span><span class="font1"> to the back, backward. From this word must be distinguished the verb “ to&nbsp;rear,” used in two main senses: of a horse, to stand up on its&nbsp;hind legs, and to raise up or lift, of the construction of a building&nbsp;or of the breeding and bringing to maturity of domestic or&nbsp;other animals, often used also of young children. The O.E.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ræran,</span><span class="font1"> of which it is the modem representative, is a doublet of&nbsp;the Scandinavian </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reisa,</span><span class="font1"> which has given English “ raise,”&nbsp;both being causative verb forms of “ rise.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REAR VAULT (Fr. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">arrière voussure),</span><span class="font1"> the term in architecture employed for the vault of the internal hood of a doorway or&nbsp;window to which a splay has been given on the reveal; sometimes the vaulting surface is terminated by a small rih known&nbsp;as the scoinson rib </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font1"> and a further development is given&nbsp;by angle shafts carrying this rib, known as scoinson shafts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REASON (Lat. </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">ratio,</span><span class="font1"> through French </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">raison),</span><span class="font1"> in philosophy, the faculty or process of drawing logical inferences. Thus we&nbsp;speak of man as essentially a rational animal, it being implied&nbsp;that man differs from all other animals in that he can consciously draw inferences from premises. It is, however,&nbsp;exceedingly difficult in this respect to draw an absolute distinction between men and animals, observation of which undoubtedly suggests that the latter have a certain power of making&nbsp;inferences. Between the higher animals and the lower types&nbsp;of mankind the distinction is so hard to draw that many&nbsp;psychologists argue that the difference is one of degree rather&nbsp;than of kind (see also Instinct). There can be little doubt,&nbsp;however, that inference by man differs from that of the brute&nbsp;creation in respect of self-consciousness, and, though there&nbsp;can be no doubt that some animals dream, it is difficult to&nbsp;find evidence for the presence of ideal images in the minds of</span></p>
