<p><span class="font2">frequently seen in children than aduIts. In cases of chronic bronchitis the affection, as a rule, begins as a slight ailment during&nbsp;the winter, and recurs in succeeding winters. The intervals of&nbsp;freedom from the trouble get shorter, and in the course of a&nbsp;few years it persists during the summer as well as the winter&nbsp;months. A condition of chronic bronchitis is thus established.&nbsp;The persistent cough which this occasions is one of the chief&nbsp;causes of the development of the condition of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">emphysema,</span><span class="font2"> where&nbsp;there is a permanent enlargement of the air-cells of the lungs&nbsp;with an atrophy of the walls of the air vesicles. The emphysema&nbsp;occasions an increase in the shortness of breath from which the&nbsp;person had previously suffered, and Iater, in consequence of&nbsp;the greater difficulty with which the blood circulates through the&nbsp;emphysematous lungs, the right side of the heart becomes&nbsp;diIated, and from that we have the development of a general&nbsp;dropsy of the subcutaneous tissues, and less and less perfect&nbsp;aeration of the blood.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The death rate from bronchitis in England and Wales during 1908 was: males 1102, females 1083 per million living. The&nbsp;death rate for the five years 1901-1905 was 1237 per million for&nbsp;all sexes. The death rate for the twenty years 1888-1908 consistently showed a slight decline.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Diseases of Occupations.—</span><span class="font2">Weall Inhaleaconsiderableamount of carbonaceous and other foreign particles, which in health are&nbsp;partly got rid of by the action of the ciliated cells lining the&nbsp;bronchial tubes, and are partly absorbed by cells in the wall of ·&nbsp;the tubes, and carried in the lymph channels to the bronchial&nbsp;lymphatic gIands, where they are deposited, and cause a more&nbsp;or less marked pigmentation of the tissues. Part of such pigment is also deposited in the walls of the bronchial tubes and the&nbsp;interstitial tissue of the lungs, giving rise to the grey appearance&nbsp;presented by the lungs of all adults who live in large cities.&nbsp;In certain dusty occupations, such as those of stone masons,&nbsp;knife-grinders, colliers, &amp;c., the foreign particles inhaled cause&nbsp;trouble. The most common affection so produced is chronic&nbsp;bronchitis, to which becomes added emphysema. In some cases&nbsp;not only is bronchitis developed, but the foreign particles lead&nbsp;to an increase of the fibrous tissue round the bronchi and in the&nbsp;interstitial tissue of the lungs, and so to a greater or lesser extent&nbsp;of fibroid consolidation. As this fibrous tissue may later undergo’softening and cavities be formed, a form of consumption is&nbsp;produced, which is named according to the particular occupation&nbsp;giving rise to it; </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.</span><span class="font2"> stonemasons’ phthisis, knife-grinders’&nbsp;phthisis, colliers’ phthisis. It should, however, be pointed out&nbsp;that these dusty occupations are probably not so frequently the&nbsp;cause as was at one time taught of these simple inflammatory&nbsp;fibroid changes in the lungs with their subsequent cavity formation; individuals engaged in such occupations are apt to&nbsp;suffer from a chronic. tuberculosis of the lung associated with&nbsp;the formation of much fibrous tissue, and the occupation simply&nbsp;predisposes the lung to the attacks of the tubercle bacillus.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The term pneumonia is frequently used of different forms of inflammation of the lungs, and includes affections which&nbsp;run different clinical, courses, present diverse appearances after death, and probably have different exciting causes. It would be better if the term </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">acute&nbsp;pneumonia</span><span class="font2"> or </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">pneumonic fever</span><span class="font2"> were reserved for that form of&nbsp;acute inflammation of the lungs which is usually characterized&nbsp;by sudden onset, and runs an acute, course, which terminates&nbsp;generally by crisis from the fifth to the tenth day, the inflammation leading to the consolidation by fibrinous effusion of&nbsp;the greater part or whole of one lobe of a lung. Acute pneumonia usually occurs in a sporadic form, and is most prevalent&nbsp;in the United Kingdom from November to March. Occasionally it is epidemic, and there is evidence to show that&nbsp;sometimes it is an infective disease. There is great difficulty,&nbsp;however, in being quite certain that the occurrence of the&nbsp;disease in those who have been attending upon or brought&nbsp;into intimate connexion with sufferers from pneumonia is&nbsp;the result of infection, for such cases may be due to an epidemic&nbsp;of the disease, or to the various individuals attacked having</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">been exposed to the same cause.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Formerly acute croupous or lobar pneumonia was thought to be due to “ catching cold we now know it to be an&nbsp;infectious disease resultant on the invasion of one or more&nbsp;specific micro-organisms. The chief micro-organisms which&nbsp;have been found to be present during an attack of acute pneumonia are the micrococcus lanceolatus or pneumococcus of&nbsp;FrankeI and Weichselbaum, which is found in the inflamed&nbsp;Iung in a large majority of cases and is capable of producing pneumonia when inoculated into guinea-pigs. Sternberg&nbsp;demonstrated the presence of ,the pneumococcus in the saliva&nbsp;of healthy individuals; it tends, however, in this case to vary&nbsp;in form. The micro-organism differs in virulence in given&nbsp;strains; thus one epidemic may be more severe than another;&nbsp;and it tends to increase in viruIence in its passage through&nbsp;the human subject.. The exact conditions necessary for the&nbsp;production of increased virulence in the organism causing an&nbsp;attack of lobar pneumonia are not yet determined, but are&nbsp;usuaIIy ascribed to lowered states of the health and to atmospheric conditions. The pneumococcus produces in the&nbsp;human organism an intracellular toxin, but the question as&nbsp;to whether it can also produce a soluble toxin in the living&nbsp;body is still debated. The difficulty of obtaining sufficient&nbsp;quantities of the toxins of this organism has prevented the&nbsp;production of antisera of high potency. In lower animals,&nbsp;less potent sera have proved successful in protecting against&nbsp;a fatal dose of pneumococci. The change effected by tbe&nbsp;administration of a serum is produced by causing a change in&nbsp;the pneumococci, which causes them to be more easily destroyed&nbsp;by the phagocytes. The element which brings about this&nbsp;change is termed an opsonin; see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Blood</span><span class="font2"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Bacteriology&nbsp;</span><span class="font2">(ii). The bacillus pneumoniae of Friedländer is also said to&nbsp;be found in a certain percentage of cases, but a number of&nbsp;observers deny its presence in pure culture in primary croupous&nbsp;pneumonia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Unlike many acute diseases, pneumonia does not render a person less liabIe to future attacks; on the contrary, those&nbsp;who have been once attacked must be looked upon as more&nbsp;prone to be affected again. Acute pneumonia usually attacks&nbsp;the whole or greater part of one lobe of one lung, but more&nbsp;than one lobe may be affected, or both lungs may be involved.&nbsp;The disease produces a solid and airless condition of the affected&nbsp;part owing to a fibrinous exudation taking pIace into the air-cells and smaller bronchial passages. In favourable cases&nbsp;the exudation is partly absorbed and partly expectorated,&nbsp;and the lung returns to its normal healthy condition; in others,&nbsp;death may ensue from the extent of lung affected, or from&nbsp;the spread of the inflammation to other parts, as for instance&nbsp;the pericardium or meninges of the brain. In such cases it is&nbsp;interesting to note that the same micro-organism has been found&nbsp;in the inflammatory exudation in the pericardium or on the&nbsp;meninges as in the pneumonic Iung; probably the organism&nbsp;had been absorbed from the lung, and was the cause of the&nbsp;secondary inflammations. In cases of death from uncomplicated pneumonia a very variable extent of lung is involved.&nbsp;In some cases this result may be ascribed to the weakness of&nbsp;the individual and especiaIIy of the heart, but in others the&nbsp;virulence of the micro-organisms and the toxins which they&nbsp;have produced is probably the more correct explanation. The&nbsp;improvement in a patient suffering from pneumonia usually&nbsp;commences suddenly, with a rapid fall in the temperature.&nbsp;The day on which this “ crisis” takes place varies, but most&nbsp;commonly it appears to be the seventh from the initial rigor&nbsp;(22 % of the cases, JUrgensen). It may, however, occur a&nbsp;few days earlier or later, being observed in about 74% between&nbsp;the fifth and the ninth day of the disease (Jiirgensen).. The&nbsp;disease occasionally ends in the formation of an abscess, in&nbsp;gangrene, or in fibroid induration of the lung, but these terminations are rare.</span></p>
