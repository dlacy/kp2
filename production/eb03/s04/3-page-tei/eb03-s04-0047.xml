This, in all probability, is the ſame animal with the hog-faced ape, adopted from Pennant.</p><p>III.	<hi rend="smallcaps">Monkeys, Cercopitheci,</hi> have long tails, which are not prehensile ; the under parts of their cheeks are furniſhed with pouches, in which they can keep their victuals ; the partition between the nostrils is thin, and the apertures are, like thoſe of man, placed in the under part of the noſe ; the buttocks are naked, and provided with calloſities. Theſe animals, which are never found native in America, are the cercopitheci, and Κυβοιof the ancients.</p><p>16.	The Tartarin, dog faced baboon of Pennant, and cercopithecus hamadryas of Gmelin, with a long, thick, and ſtrong noſe, covered with a ſmooth red ſkin ; ears pointed, and hid in the hair ; head great, and flat ; hair on the head, and fore part of the body as far as the waiſt, very long and ſhaggy ; grey and olive-brinded ; the ſides oſ the head very full, the hair on the limbs and hind part of the body very ſhort; limbs ſtrong and thick ; hands and feet dusky ; the nails on the fore-feet flat ; thoſe on the hind like a dog’s ; buttocks very bare, and covered with a ſkin of a bloody colour ; tail ſcarce the length of the body, and carried generally erect. They inhabit the hotteſt parts of Africa and Alia ; where they keep in vaſt troops, and are very fierce and dangerous. They rob gardens. They will run up trees when paſſengers go by, ſhake the boughs at them with great fury, and chatter very loud. They are exceſſively impudent, indecent, laſcivious ; moſt deteſtable animals in their manners as well as appearance. They range the woods in hundreds ; which obliges the owners of the coffee-plantations to be continually on their guard againſt their depredations. One of them was ſhown in London ſome years ago : it came from Mokha, in the province of Yeman, in Arabia Felix in the Persian gulph ; and was above five feet high. It was very fierce and untameable ; ſo ſtrong as eaſily to maſter its keeper, a ſtout young man. Its inclinations to women appeared in the moſt violent manner. A footman, who brought a girl to ſee it, in order to teaze the animal, killed and hugged her : the beaſt, enraged at being ſo tantalized, caught hold of a quart pewter- pot, which he threw with such force and ſo ſure an aim, that, had not the man’s hat and wig ſoftened the blow, his skull muſt have been fractured ; but he fortunately eſcaped with a common broken head.</p><p>17.	The white-bearded black wanderu, the ſimia ſilenus of Linnæus, the ouanderou of Buffon, and liontailed baboon of Pennant, the cercopithecus ſilenus albibarbatus of Gmelin, has a dog-like face, is naked, and of a duſky colour ; a very large and full white or hoary beard ; large canine teeth ; body covered with black hair ; belly of a light colour ; tail terminated with a tuft of hair like that of a lion. Its bulk that of a middling ſized dog. It inhabits the Eaſt Indies and the hotter parts of Africa.</p><p>18.	The purple-faced monkey, or cercopithecus ſilenus purpuratus, with a great triangular white beard, ſhort and pointed at the bottom, and on each side of the ears, extending a winged faſhion far beyond them ; face and hands purple, body black. Inhabit Ceylon. They are very harmleſs ; live in the woods, and feed on leaves and buds of trees ; and when taken ſoon become tame.</p><p>19. Malbrouk, or cercopithecus faunus, has along tail, and is bearded ; the tail is buſhy at the extremity. It is a native of Bengal. This ſpecies has cheek- pouches, and calloſities on the buttocks ; the tail is nearly as long as the body and head ; and it is a mistake of Cluſius that it terminates in a tuft ; the face is oſ a cinereous grey colour, with a large muzzle, and large eyes, which have fleſh-coloured eyelids, and a grey band croſs the forehead in the place of eye-brows; the ears are large, thin, and fleſh-coloured ; the upper parts of the body are of a uniform yellowiſh brown colour, and the lower of a yellowiſh grey : It walks on all fours, and is about a foot and a half from the muzzle to the extremity of the tail. The females menſtruate.</p><p>20. Macaque, or cercopithecus cynomologus, the hare-lipped monkey of Pennant, has no beard ; the nostrils are thick and divided ; the tail is long and arched, and the buttocks are naked. He has cheek-pouches and calloſities on the buttocks. His tail is from 18 to 20 inches long. His head is large, his muzzle very thick, and his face naked, livid, and wrinkled. His ears are covered with hair. His body is ſhort and squat, and his limbs thick and ſhort. The hair on the superior parts of his body is of a greeniſh aſh-colour, and of a yellowiſh grey on the breaſt and belly. He has a ſmall creſt of hair on the top of the head. He walks on four and ſometimes on two feet. The length of his body, comprehending that of the head, is about 18 or 20 inches.</p><p>21. The dog-headed monkey, or cercopithecus cynocephalus, has no beard, and is of a yellow colour ; the muzzle is long ; the tail long and ſtraight, and the buttocks naked. It is a native of Africa.</p><p>22.	The ſpotted monkey, or cercopſthecus Diana, with a long white beard : colour of the upper parts of the body reddiſh, as if they had been ſinged, marked with white ſpecks ; the belly and chin whitiſh ; tail very long ; is a ſpecies of a middle ſize. It inhabits Guinea and Congo, according to Marcgrave ; the Congeſe call it <hi rend="italic">exquima.</hi> M. de Buffon denies it to be of that country ; but from the circumſtance of the curl in its tail, in Marcgrave’s figure, and the deſcription of ſome voyagers, he ſuppoſes it to be a native of South America. Linnæus deſcribes his S. Diana ſomewhat differently : he says it is of the ſize of a large cat ; black, ſpotted with white ; hind part of the back ferruginous; face black ; from the top of the noſe is a white line paſſing over each eye to the ears, in an arched form ; beard pointed, black above, white beneath, placed on a  fattiſh excreſcence ; breaſt and throat white ; from the rump, croſs the thighs, a white line ; tail long, ſtraight, and black ; ears and feet of the ſame colour ; canine teeth, large.</p><p>23.	The green monkey, or cercopſthecus sabœus, has a black and flattiſh face : the side of it bounded by long white hairs, falling backwards, and almoſt covering the ears, which are black, and like the human : head, limbs, and whole upper part of the body and tail covered with ſoft hair, of a yellowiſh green colour at their ends, cinereous at their roots : underside of the body and tail, and inner fide of the limbs, of a ſilvery colour : tail very long and ſlender. Size of a ſmall cat. Inhabit different parts of Africa : keep in great flocks, and live in the woods : are ſcarce diſcernible when among the leaves, except by their breaking the boughs with their</p></body></text></TEI>
