<p><span class="font2">RHUBARB. This name is applied both to a drug and to a vegetable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">I. </span><span class="font2">The drug has been used in medicine from very early times, being described in the Chinese herbal </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Pen-king,</span><span class="font2"> which&nbsp;is believed to date from 2700 b.c. The name seems to be&nbsp;a corruption of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum barbarum qt Reu'barbarum,</span><span class="font2"> a designation applied{to the drug as early as the middle of the 6th century,&nbsp;and apparently identical with the pijop or pa of Dioscorides,&nbsp;described by him as a root brought from beyond the Bosporus.&nbsp;In the 14th century rhubarb appears to have found its way&nbsp;to Europe by way of the Indus and Persian Gulf to the Red&nbsp;Sea and Alexandria, and was therefore described as “ East&nbsp;Indian ” rhubarb. Some also came by way of Persia and&nbsp;the Caspian to Syria and Asia Minor, and reached Europe&nbsp;from the ports of Aleppo and Smyrna, and became known&nbsp;as “ Turkey ” rhubarb. Subsequently to the year 1653,&nbsp;when China first permitted Russia to trade on her frontiers,&nbsp;Chinese rhubarb reached Europe chiefly by way of Moscow;&nbsp;and in 1704 the rhubarb trade became a monopoly of the&nbsp;Russian government, in consequence of which the term&nbsp;“ Russian ” or “ crown ” rhubarb came to be applied to it.&nbsp;Urga was the great depot for the rhubarb trade in 1719, but&nbsp;in 1728 the depot was transferred to Kiachta. AU rhuba'rb&nbsp;brought to the depot passed through the hands of the government inspector; hence Russian rhubarb was invariably good&nbsp;and obtained a remarkably high price. This severe supervision naturafly led, as soon as the northern Chinese ports&nbsp;were thrown open to European trade, to a new outlet being&nbsp;sought; and the increased demand for the drug at these ports&nbsp;resulted in less care being exercised by the Chinese in the&nbsp;collection and curing of the root, so that the rhubarb of good&nbsp;quality offered at Kiachta rapidly dwindled in quantity, and&nbsp;after i860 Russian rhubarb ceased to appear in European&nbsp;commerce. Owing to the expense of carrying the drug across&nbsp;the whole breadth of Asia, and the difficulty of preserving it&nbsp;from the attacks of insects, rhubarb was formerly one of the&nbsp;most costly of drugs. In 1542 it was sold in France for ten&nbsp;times the price of cinnamon and four times that of saffron, and&nbsp;in an English price list bearing date of 1657 it is quoted at 16s.&nbsp;per lb, opium being at that time only 6s. and scammony 12s.&nbsp;per lb.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The dose of rhubarb is anything from j up to 30 grains, according to the action which is desired. The British Pharmacopeia&nbsp;contains seven preparations, only one of which is of any special&nbsp;value. This is the Pulvis Rhei Compositus, or Gregory’s powder,&nbsp;which is composed of 2 parts of rhubarb, 6 of heavy or light&nbsp;magnesia and 1 of ginger. The dose is 20 to 60 gr.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Rhubarb is used in small doses—£ to 2 gr.—as an astringent tonic, since it stimulates all the functions of the upper part of the alimentary&nbsp;canal. In many cases </span><span class="font1">of </span><span class="font3">torpid dyspepsia it is very efficient when&nbsp;combined with the subnitrate of bismuth and the bicarbonate </span><span class="font1">of&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">sodium. The more characteristic action of rhubarb, however, is&nbsp;purgation, which it causes in doses of 15 gr. and upwards.. The&nbsp;action occurs within seven or eight hours, a soft, pulpy motion of&nbsp;a yellow colour being produced. The.colour is due to the chrysarobin, which is also the purgative constituent of the drug. Rhubarb&nbsp;is also a secretory cholagogue, increasing the amount of bile formed&nbsp;by the liver. The drug is apt to cause colic, and should therefore&nbsp;never be given alone. The-ginger in Gregory’s powder averts this&nbsp;unpleasant consequence of the aperient properties of rhubarb. The&nbsp;drug is peculiar in that the purgation is succeeded by deAnite&nbsp;constipation, said to be due to the rheotannic acid. This explanation is hardly satisfactory, however, since it is difficult to see how&nbsp;the rheotannic acid can be retained in the bowel during the process&nbsp;of purgation. Rhubarb has, therefore, deAnite indications and&nbsp;contra-indications. It is obviously worse than useless in the&nbsp;treatment of chronic constipation, which it only aggravates. On&nbsp;the other hand, it is very valuable in children.and others, when&nbsp;diarrhoea has been caused by an unsuitable dietary. The drug&nbsp;removes the indigestible residue of the food and then gives the bowel&nbsp;rest. Rhubarb is also useful in the weaning of infants, since it is&nbsp;partly excreted in the maternal milk, and gives it a bitter taste&nbsp;which the baby dislikes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Some Chiysarobin is absorbed and is excreted in the urine, which it. slightly increases and colours a reddish brown. The colour is&nbsp;discharged by the addition of a little dilute hydrochloric acid to&nbsp;the urine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The botanical source of Chinese rhubarb cannot be said to have been as yet deflnitely cleared up by actual identiflcation of plants&nbsp;observed to be used for the purpose. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum palmatum, R. officinales&nbsp;R- palmatum,</span><span class="font3"> var. </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Iqnguticum, R. Colinianum</span><span class="font3"> and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R. Franzenbachii&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">have been variously stated to be the source of it, but the roots&nbsp;produced by these species under cultivation, in Europe do not&nbsp;present the characteristic network of white veins exhibited by the&nbsp;best specimens of the Chinese drug.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Chemistry.—</span><span class="font3">The most important constituent of this drug, giving it its purgative properties and its yellow colour, is chrysarobin,&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">CioH<sub>m</sub>O<sub>7</sub>,</span><span class="font3"> formerly known as rhein or chrysophan. The rhubaib of&nbsp;commerce also contains chrysophanic acid, a dioxymethyl anthraquinone, C<sub>u</sub>Hi(CH<sub>j</sub>)Oi(OH)<sub>2</sub>, of which chrysarobin is a reduction&nbsp;product. Nearly 40% of the drug consists of calcium »oxalate,&nbsp;which gives it the characteristic grittiness. There is also present&nbsp;rheotannic acid, which is of some practical importance. There are&nbsp;numerous other constituents, such as emodin, CuHioOß, mucilage,&nbsp;resins, rheumic acid, </span><span class="font2" style="font-variant:small-caps;">CmHuOj,</span><span class="font3"> aporrhetin, &amp;c.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Production and Commerce.—</span><span class="font3">Rhubarb is produced in the four northern provinces of China proper (Chih-li, Shan-se, Shen-se and&nbsp;Ho-nan), in the north-west provinces of Kan-suh, formerly included&nbsp;in Shen-se, but now extending across the desert of Gobi to the&nbsp;frontier of Tibet, in the Mongolian province of Tsing-hai, including&nbsp;the salt lake Koko-nor, and the districts of 'Tangut, Sifan and&nbsp;Turfan, and in the mountains of the western provinces of Sze-chuen.@@<sup>1&nbsp;</sup>Two of the most important centres of the trade are Sining-fu in the&nbsp;province of Kan-suh, and Kwanhien in Sze-chuen. From Shen-se,&nbsp;Kan-suh and Sze-chuen the rhubarb is forwarded to Hankow,&nbsp;and thence carried to Shanghai, whence it is shipped to Europe.&nbsp;Lesser quantities are shipped from Tien-tsin, and occasionally the&nbsp;drug is exported from Canton, Amoy, Fuh-chow and Ning-po.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Very little is known concerning the mode of preparing the drug for the market. According to Mr Bell, who on a journey from St&nbsp;Petersburg to Peking had the opportunity of observing the plant in a&nbsp;growing state, the root is not considered to be mature until it is six&nbsp;years old. It is then dug up, usually in the autumn, and deprived&nbsp;of its cortical portion and smaller branches, and the larger pieces&nbsp;are divided in half longitudinally; these pieces are bored with&nbsp;holes and strung up on cords to dry, in some cases being previously&nbsp;subjected to a preliminary drying on stone slabs heated by Are&nbsp;underneath. In Bhutan the root is said to be hung up in a kind&nbsp;of drying room, in which a moderate heat is regularly maintained.&nbsp;The effect produced by the two drying processes is very different:&nbsp;when dried by artiflcial heat, the exterior of the pieces becomes&nbsp;hardened before the interior has entirely lost its moisture, and&nbsp;consequently the pieces decay in the centre, although the surface&nbsp;may show no change. These two varieties are technically known&nbsp;as kiln-dried and sun-dried; and it was on account of this difference in quality that the Russian officer at Kiachta had every piece&nbsp;examined by boring a hole to its centre.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">European Rhubarb.</span><span class="font3">—As early as 1608 Prosper Alpinus of Padua cultivated as the true rhubarb a plant which is now known as&nbsp;</span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Rheum rhaponticum,</span><span class="font3"> a native of southern Siberia and the basin&nbsp;of the Volga. This plant was introduced into England through&nbsp;Sir Matthew Lister, physician to Charles I., who gave seed obtained&nbsp;by him in Italy to the botanist Parkinson. The culture of this&nbsp;rhubarb for the sake of the root was commenced in 1777 at Banbury,&nbsp;in Oxfordshire, by an apothecary named Hayward, the plants&nbsp;being raised from seed sent from Russia in 1762, and with such&nbsp;success that the Society of Arts awarded him a silver medal in&nbsp;1789 and a gold one in 1704. The cultivation subsequently extended&nbsp;to Somersetshire, Yorkshire, and Middlesex, but is now chiefly&nbsp;carried on at Banbury. English rhubarb root is sold at a cheaper&nbsp;rate than the Chinese rhubarb, and forms.a considerable article of&nbsp;export to America, and is said to be used in Britain in the form of&nbsp;powder, which is of a AnerJyellow colour than that of Chinese rhubarb.&nbsp;The Banbury rhubarb appears to be a hybrid between </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R. rhaponticum&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">and </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">R. undulatum—</span><span class="font3">the root, according to E. Colin, not presenting&nbsp;the typical microscopic structure of the former. More recently very</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">@@@<sup>1</sup>According to Mr </span><span class="font2">F. </span><span class="font3">Newcombe<sub>t</sub>Ifed* </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Press and Circ.,</span><span class="font3"> August 2, 1882, the Chinese esteem the Shen-se rhubarb as the best, that&nbsp;coming from Kanchow being the most prized of all; Sze-chuen&nbsp;rhubarb has a rougher surface and little flavour., and brings onlv&nbsp;about half the price; Chung-chi rhubarb also is greatly valued,&nbsp;while the Chi-chuang, Tai-huang and Shan-huang varieties are&nbsp;considered worthless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<sub>#</sub></span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
