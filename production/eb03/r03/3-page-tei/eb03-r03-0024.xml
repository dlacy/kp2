This is produced by the weight laid on the fledge. If this be too ſmall, the ſtrands will not be ſuſſiciently tightened, and will run into kinks. The fledge will come up by ſtarts ; and a ſmall inequality of twiſt in the ſtrands will throw it aſkew. The top will not run vzell without a conſiderable preſ-ſure to throw it from the doling point, and therefore the cordage will neither cloſe fairly nor firmly ; on the other hand, it is evident, that the ſtrain on the ſtrands is a complete expenditure of ſo much of their force, and it may be ſo great as to break them. Theſe are the extreme politions. And we think tha*<hi rend="sup">-</hi> it may be fairly deduced from our principles, that as great a ſtrain ſhould be laid on the ſtrands as will make good work, that is, as will enable the rope to cloſe nearly and completely, but no more. But can any general rule be given for this purpoſe ?</p><p>The practice at Rochefort was to load the fledge till its weight and load were double the weight of the yarns when warped 180 fathoms. A lix-inch hawſer will require about a ton. If we ſuppoſe the friction one-third of the weight ; the ſtrain on each ſtrand will be about two hundred and a quarter weight. Mr Du Hamel thinks this too great a load, and propoſes to put only five-fourths or three-ſeconds of the weight of the cordage ; and ſtill leſs if a ſhorter piece be warped, becauſe it does not require ſo much force to throw the twiſt from the two cranks to the middle of the ſtrand. We ſhall only ſay, that ſtronger ropes are made by heavy loading the carriage, and working up moderately, than by greater ſhortening, and a lighter load ; but all this is very vague.</p><p>The reader will naturally aſk, after this account of the manufacture, what is the general rule for computing the ſtrength of cordage ? It cannot be expected to be very preciſe. But if ropes are made in a manner perfectly ſimilar, we ſhould expect the ſtrength to be in proportion to the area of their ſection ; that is, to the ſquare of their diameters or circumferences, or to the number of equal threads contained in them.</p><p>Nor does it deviate far from this rule ; yet Mr Du Hamel ſhows, from a range of experiments made, on all cordage of 3⅜ inch circumference and under, that the ſtrength increaſes a little falter than the number of equal threads. Thus he found that ropes of</p><p>9 threads    bore    1014    pounds, inſtead    of 946</p><p>12    1564    1262</p><p>18    2148    1893.</p><p>We cannot pretend to account for this. W e muſt. alſo obſerve, that the ſtrength of cordage is greatly improved by making them of yarn ſpun fine. This requires finely dreſſed hemp and being more ſupple, the fibres lie cloſe, and do not form ſuch oblique ſpirals. But all hemp will not ſpin equally fine. Every ſtalk ſeems to confiſt of a certain number of principal fibres, which ſplit more eafily into a ſecond ſet, and theſe more difficultly into a third ſet, and ſo on. The ultimate fineneſs, therefore, which a reaſonable degree of drei-, fing can give to hemp, bears ſome proportion, not indeed very preciſe, to the ſize of the ſtalk. The Bri-tilh and Dutch uſe the beſt hemp, ſpin their yarn the fineſt, and their cordage is conſiderably ſtronger than the French, much of which is made of their own hemp, and others of a coarſe and harlh quality.</p><p>The following rule forjudging of the weight which a rope will bear is not far from the truth. It ſuppoſes' them rather too ſtrong ; but it is ſo eafily remembered that it may be of uſe.</p><p>Multiply the circumference in inches by itſelf, and take the fifth part of the product, it will expreſs the tons which the rope will carry. Thus, if the rope have 6 inches circumference, 6 times 6 is 36, the fifth of which is 7γ- tons ; apply this to the rope of 3 J, on which Sir Charles Knowles made the experiments formerly mentioned, 3 J- × 3 J = ιo,2j, <hi rend="italic">j-</hi>  of which is 2,05 tons, or 4592 pounds. It broke with 4550.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">This may ſuſſice for an account of the mechanical part of the manufacture. But we have taken no notice of the operation of tarring ; and our reaſon was, that the methods practiſed in different rope-works are ſo exceedingly different, that we could hardly enumerate them, or even give a general account of them. It is evidently proper to tar in the ſtate of twine or yarn, this being the only way that the hemp could be uniformly penetrated. The yarn is made to wind off one reel, and having paſſed through a veſſel containing hot tar, it is wound up on another reel ; and the ſuperfluous tar is taken ©ſſ by paſſing through a hole ſurrounded with ſpongy oakum ; or it is tarred in ſkains or hauls, which are drawn by a capltern through the tar-kettle, and through a hole formed of two plates of metal, held together by a lever loaded with a weight.</hi></p><p>It is eſtabliſhed beyond a doubt, that tarred cordage when new is weaker than white, and that the difference increaſes by keeping. The following experiments were made by Mr Du Hamel at Rochefort on cordage of three inches (French) in circumference, made of the belt.
