<p><span class="font3">viour’s ſoul was not to be left </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">in </span><span class="font3">hell </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">5 and </span><span class="font3">we know that on the day of his crucifixion he went not to hea-veil : for after he had riſen from the place of the dead,&nbsp;he forbade one of the women to touch him, as he had&nbsp;not yet aſcended to the Father. Hell, therefore, and&nbsp;paradiſe, continue they, ſeem to be in this paſſage the&nbsp;very ſame thing, the place of the dead ; and our Savi-our’s intention, they add, was not to go to heaven at&nbsp;that time, but to ſhow his victory' over death and the&nbsp;grave, to whoſe power all mankind had become ſub-ject by the diſobedience of their ſirſt parents.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">without pretending to enter into the merits of this difpute, the ingenious Burnet, in his Theory of the&nbsp;Earth, endeavours to prove, upon the authority of the&nbsp;ancient fathers, that paradiſe lies between the earth and&nbsp;the moon ; and the learned Dodwell, on the ſame authority, has made it the common receptacle of fouls till&nbsp;the reſurrection ; but has not told us whether or not&nbsp;they are to be accountable for the actions of this ſeparate exiſtence at the latter day, or are only to be&nbsp;judged according to the deeds that were done in their&nbsp;bodies.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This notion of a common receptacle has diſpleaſed many. The ſtate of purgation, obſcurely hinted in the&nbsp;doctrines of Pythagoras, and openly avowed by Plato&nbsp;and virgil, has been adopted by the Romiſh divines,&nbsp;who ſupport their opinion on certain obſcure paſſages&nbsp;of ſcripture, which are always of a yielding and a waxen&nbsp;nature, may caſily be twilled to any hypotheſis, and like&nbsp;general lovers efpouſe rather from intereſt than merit.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">It has diſpleaſed others, becauſe they are anxious that the righteous ſhould have a fore-taſte of their joys, and&nbsp;the wicked of their torments, immediately after death,&nbsp;which they infer to be certainly the caſe from the parable of the rich man and Lazarus(u). But to this it is&nbsp;objected, that the rich man is ſuppoſed to be in hell,&nbsp;the place of torments, and that this puniſhment ought&nbsp;not to take place on their own hypotheſis till after the&nbsp;ſentence at the reſurrection.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Another argument uſed for the intermediate ſtate is the viſion of St John in the Apocalypſe. In this viſion the Evangeliſt faw under the altar the fouls of thoſe&nbsp;that were ſlain for the word of God and for the teſtimo-ny which they held. Their opponents doubt whether&nbsp;theſe viſible fouls were immaterial, as St John heard them&nbsp;cry with a loud voice, and ſaw white robes given unto&nbsp;every one of them. If they had bodies, that circumſtance&nbsp;might chance to prove a refurrection immediately after&nbsp;death, and ſo ſuperſede the general reſurrection at the&nbsp;laſt day.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">while ſuch concluſions as are here drawn ſrom the parable and viſion, ſay the oppoſers of an intermediate&nbsp;confcious exiſtence, imply that the dead are already&nbsp;raifed, and are now receiving the reſpective rewards of&nbsp;their virtues and their crimes ; thoſe who maintain an&nbsp;intermediate ſeparate exiſtence, who ſpeak of the body&nbsp;as a prifon, and of the ſoul as receiving an increaſe of&nbsp;power when freed from the body, are certainly not more&nbsp;than conſiſtent with themſelves, when they think that&nbsp;this foul would derive an advantage from its after union&nbsp;with either a new ſyſtem of matter or the old onc, how-ever much altered. Baxter, they ſay, who ſaw the in-</span></p><a name="caption1"></a><h1><span class="font1">conſiſtency, was diſpoſed to reaſon ſomewhat like Æ-neaβ,</span></h1><h3><span class="font0">O, Father ! can it be that fouls fublime</span></h3>
<p><span class="font3">Return to viſit our terreſtrial çlime ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Ογ that the gett’rous mind, releas’d at death,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Should covet lazy limbs and mortal breath ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">In no one inſtance, they continue, have Chriſtiann perhaps more apparently than in this argument wreſted&nbsp;the ſcriptures to their own hurt: by thus raſhly at-temping to accommodate the ſacred doctrines of religion to a preconceived philofophical hypotheſis, they&nbsp;have laid themfelves open to the ridicule of deiſts, and&nbsp;have been obliged, for the fake of confiſtency, either to&nbsp;deny or to ſpeak ſlightingly of the refurrection; which&nbsp;is certainly the ſureſt foundation of their hope, feeing&nbsp;St Paul hath aſſured us, that if there be no reſurrection&nbsp;of the dead, then they which are fallen aſleep in Chriſt&nbsp;are periſhed, and thoſe who ſurvive may eat and drink,&nbsp;and act as they pleafe, for to-morrow they die; and die,&nbsp;too, never to five again.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Though this reproof may be rather ſevere, we are forry to obferve that there ſeems to havc been fome-times too much reaſon for it. A certain divine J, whoſe&nbsp;piety was eminent, and.whoſe memory we reſpect, having written &quot; An Eſſay toward the proof of a ſeparate State oſ Souls between Death and the Reſurrec -tion, and the Commencement of the Rewards of virtue and vice immediately after death,” has taken this&nbsp;motto, &quot; Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not&nbsp;executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the fons of&nbsp;men is fully ſet in them to do evil.” “ The doctrine, he&nbsp;ſays, of the reſurrection of the body and the conſc-quent ſtates of heaven and of hell, is </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a </span><span class="font3">guard and motive of divine force, but it is renounced by the enemies&nbsp;of our holy Chriſtianſty ; and ſhould we give up the re-compenfes of ſeparate fouls, while the deiſt denies thc&nbsp;reſurrection of the body, I fear, between both we ſhould&nbsp;fadly enfeeble and expoſe the cauſe of virtue, and leave&nbsp;it too naked and defenceleſs.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">This author, who wiſhes much that the puniſhment of crimes ſhould follow immediately after death, is of&nbsp;opinion, that if heaven intended to check vice and impiety in the world, it has acted unwiſely, if it really has&nbsp;deferred the puniſhment of the wicked to fo late a pe-riod as the reſurrection. &quot; For ſuch, he obſerves, is the&nbsp;weakneſs and folly of our natures, that men will not&nbsp;be fo much influenced and alarmed by diſtant proſpects,&nbsp;nor fo folicttous to prepare for an event which they&nbsp;ſuppoſe to be fo very far off, as they would for the ſame&nbsp;event if it commences as foon as ever this mortal life&nbsp;expires. The vicious man will indulge his ſenſualities,&nbsp;and lie down to ſleep in death with this comfort, I&nbsp;ſhall take my reſt here for </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">too </span><span class="font3">or 1000 years, and perhaps in all that fpace my offences may be forgotten ;&nbsp;or let the worſt come that can come, I ſhall have </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">a&nbsp;</span><span class="font3">long ſweet nap before my ſorrows begin : and thus the&nbsp;force of divine terrors is greatly enervated by this delay&nbsp;of puniſhment.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">Thus far our author, who thinks that his hypothe-fis, if not true, is at leaſt expedient, and that from motives of expediency it ought to </span><span class="font0">be </span><span class="font3">inculcated as a doc</span></p><div>
