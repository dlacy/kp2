<p><span class="font1">rived from the verb </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">portare,</span><span class="font1"> “ to carry’.” As mount Palatine ſtood by itſelf, the whole was incloſed within&nbsp;the line made by the plough, which formed almoſt the&nbsp;figure of a ſquare ; whence, by Dionyſius Halicarnaf-ſenſis, it is called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roma ſſyadrata.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As to the exact year of the foundation of Rome, there is a great diſagreement among hiſtorians and chronolo-gers. Fabius Pictor, the moſt ancient of all the Roman&nbsp;writers, places it in the end of the ſeventh Olympiad ;&nbsp;that is, according to the computation of Uſher, in the&nbsp;year of the world 3256, of the flood 1600, and 748&nbsp;before the Chriſtian sera. The Romans, if we may ſo&nbsp;call them, began to build, as Plutarch and others inform us, on the 2tſt of April; which day was then&nbsp;conſecrated to Pales, goddeſs of the ſhephercls ; whence&nbsp;the feſtival of Pales, and that of the foundation of the&nbsp;city, were afterwards jointly celebrated at Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When Rome had received the utmoſt perfection which its poor and rude founder could give it, it&nbsp;conſiſted of about 1000 houſes, or rather huts ; and&nbsp;was properly ſpeaking a beggarly- village, whereof&nbsp;the principal inhabitants followed the plough, being&nbsp;obliged to cultivate with their own hands the ungrateful&nbsp;ſoil of a barren country which they had ſhared among&nbsp;themſelves. Even the walls of Romulus’s palace were&nbsp;made of ruſhes, and covered with thatch. As every&nbsp;one had choſen his ground to build upon, without any&nbsp;regard to the regularity and beauty of the whole, the&nbsp;ſtreets, if we may ſo call them, were both crooked and&nbsp;narrow. In ſhort, Rome, till it was rebuilt after the&nbsp;burning of it by the Gauls, was rather a diſorderly heap&nbsp;of huts, than a city built with any regularity or order.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As ſoon as the building of the city was finiſhed, Romulus aſſembled the people, and deſired them to chooſe what kind of government they would obey. At that&nbsp;time monarchy was the unanimous voice of the Romans, and Romulus was elected king. Before he&nbsp;aſcended the throne, however, he conſulted the will of&nbsp;the gods by augury ; and having received a favourable&nbsp;anſwer, it thence became an eſtabliſhed cuſtom to have&nbsp;recourſe to augury before the raiſing any one to the dignity of king, prieſt, or any public employment. After&nbsp;this he applied himſelf to the eſtabliſhment of good order and ſubordination among his ſubjects. He put on&nbsp;a habit of diſtinction for himſelf, appointed j 2 lictors&nbsp;to attend him as guards, divided his ſubjects, who at this&nbsp;time conſiſted only of 33,000 men, into </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">curia. decurine.&nbsp;patricians, plebeians, patrons, clients,</span><span class="font0"> &amp;c. for an account&nbsp;of which, ſee theſe articles as they occur in the order of&nbsp;the alphabet. - After this he formed a ſenate conſiſting&nbsp;of too perſons, choſen from among the patricians ; and&nbsp;a guard of }OO young men called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">celer es,</span><span class="font0"> who attended&nbsp;the king, and ſought either on foot or on horſeback as&nbsp;occaſion required. The king’s office at home was to&nbsp;take care of religious affairs, to be the guardian of laws&nbsp;and cuſtoms ; to decide the weightier cauſes between&nbsp;man and man, referring thoſe of ſmaller moment to the&nbsp;ſenate ; to call together the ſenators, and aſſemble the&nbsp;people, firſt delivering his own opinion concerning&nbsp;the affair 1 e propoſed, and then ratifying by his confient&nbsp;what was agreed on by the majority. Abroad, and in&nbsp;the time of war, he was to command the army with abſolute authority, and to take care of the public money.&nbsp;The ſenate were not only to be judges in matters of ſmall</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1">importance, but to debate and reſolve upon ſuch public affairs as the king propoſed, and to determine them by&nbsp;a plurality of voices. The people were allowed to&nbsp;create magiſtrates, enact laws, and reſolve upon any war&nbsp;which the king propoſed ; but in all theſe things the&nbsp;confient of the ſenate was neceſſary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Romulus next proceeded to ſettle the religious affairs of his people. Many of the Trojan and Phry« gian deities were added to thoſe whom the Aborigines&nbsp;or Italian natives already worſhipped. He choſe prieſts,&nbsp;inſtituted feſtivals, and laid the foundation of a regular&nbsp;ſyſtem of religion ; after which, as his colony was ſtill&nbsp;thinly peopled, he opened an aſylum for fugitive ſlaves,&nbsp;homicides, outlaws, and debtors. Theſe, however, he&nbsp;did not at firſt receive within the walls, but appointed&nbsp;for their habitation the hill Saturnius called afterward3&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Capitolinas,</span><span class="font0"> on which he erected a temple to a divinity&nbsp;of his own invention, whom he named the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Alyleaη god,&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">under whoſe protection all criminals were to live ſecure-ly. But afterwards, when the city was enlarged, the&nbsp;aſylum was incloſed within the walls, and thoſe who&nbsp;who dwelt in it included among the citizens of Rome.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When Romulus had thus ſettled every thing relating to his new colony, it was found that a ſupply of women was wanting to perpetuate its duration. This occaſioned ſome difficulty ; for the neighbouring nations&nbsp;refuſed to give their daughters in marriage to ſuch a&nbsp;crew of vagabonds as had ſettled in Rome ; wherefore&nbsp;Romulus at laſt reſolved on the following expedient. By&nbsp;the advice of his grandfather Numitor, and with thecon-ſent of the ſenate, he proclaimed a ſolemn feaſt and public games in honour of the Equeſtrian Neptune called&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Cotiſus.</span><span class="font0"> This occaſioned a great concourir of people,&nbsp;who flocked from the adjacent parts to behold theſe&nbsp;pompous ſhows, together with the new city. But, in&nbsp;the midſt of the ſolemnity, the Romane, ruſhing in&nbsp;with their ſwords drawn, ſeized all the young women, to&nbsp;the number of 683, for whom Romulus choſe huſhands.&nbsp;Among all thoſe who were thus ſeized, only one married woman, named </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Herlllia,</span><span class="font0"> was found ; and Romulus&nbsp;is ſaid to have kept her ſor himſelf.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">This violence ſoon brought on a war with the neighbouring nations. Acron king of Cænina, a city on the confines of Latium, having entered into a league&nbsp;with the inhabitants of Cruſtuminum and Antemnæ,&nbsp;invaded the Roman territories. Romulus marched&nbsp;againſt them without delay, defeated the confederate&nbsp;army, killed their king in Angle combat, decreed himſelf&nbsp;a triumph, and conſecrated the ſpoils of Acron to Jupiter Feretrius, under the name of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Opima Spolia.</span><span class="font0"> The&nbsp;city of Cænina was razed to the ground, and the inhabitants tranſplanted to Rome, where they were admitted&nbsp;to the privileges of citizens. The king then marched&nbsp;with one legion (conſiſting at this time of 3003 foot&nbsp;and 3so horſe) againſt the Cruſtumini and Antemnates,&nbsp;both of whom he defeated in battle, and tranſplanted the&nbsp;inhabitants to Rome ; which being incapable of holding&nbsp;ſuch a number, Romulus took in the hill Saturnius&nbsp;above-mentioned, on the top of which he built a citadel, committing the care of it to a noble Roman named&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Tarpe&gt;us.</span><span class="font0"> The citadel was ſurrounded on all ſides with&nbsp;ramparts and towers, which equally commanded the&nbsp;city and country. From the loot of the hill Saturnius&nbsp;a wall was carried on quite to the Tiber, and a gate</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
