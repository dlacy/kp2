<p><span class="font1">RENNES, a town of France, in Bretagne, and capital of that province. Before the revolution it had a biſhop’s ſee, two abbeys, a parliament, and a mint. It&nbsp;is very populous ; the houſes are fix or feven ſtories&nbsp;high, and the ſuburbs of larger extent than the toιvn&nbsp;itfeif. The cathedral church is large, and the parlia-ment-houſe a handſome ſtructure. The great ſquare&nbsp;belonging to it is ſurrounded with handlome houfes.&nbsp;There is a tower, formerly a pagan temple, which now&nbsp;contains the town-clock. It is ſeated on the river VÜ-laine, which divides it into two parts, and was ancient-ly fortified, but the walls are now in ruins, and the&nbsp;ditch nearly ſilled up. The ſiege of the city by Ed-ward III. king of England, is very celebrated in hi-ſtory. The Engliſh and Breton army conſiſted of&nbsp;40,000 men ; and nevertheleſs, after having remained&nbsp;before it fix months, were obliged to retire without&nbsp;ſucceſs. E. Long. o. 23. N. Lat. 48. 7.</span></p>

It confiſts in ſewing two pieces of cloth&nbsp;edge to edge, without doubling them, ſo that the ſeam&nbsp;ſcaree appears ; and hence it is denominated</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">fine-drawing.&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">lt is a French word meaning the ſame thing, and is derived from the Latin </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">reirahere,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">re, in,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">trahere,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">becauſe the ſeam is drawn in or covered. WC are told*,&nbsp;that in the Eaſt Indies, if a piece of fine muſiin be torn&nbsp;and afterwards mended by the ſine-drawers, it will be&nbsp;impoſſible to diſcover where the rent was. Irf this&nbsp;country the dexterity of the ſine-drawers is not ſo great&nbsp;as that of thoſe in the eaſt ; but it is ſtill ſuch as to enable them to defraud the revenue, by fewing a head or&nbsp;ſlip of Engliſh cloth on a piece of Dutch, Spaniſh, or&nbsp;other foreign cloth : or a ſiip of foreign cloth on a&nbsp;piece of Engliſh, ſo as to paſs the whole as of a piece ;&nbsp;and by that means avoid the duties, penalties, &amp;c.
