<p><span class="font0">Guards Corps had all reached Plevna-by Oct. 20th, and two divisions were at once placed under Guiko’s orders, raising&nbsp;his command to 35,000 infantry, 10,000 cavalry and 48 guns.&nbsp;His instructions were to capture the Turkish positions along&nbsp;the Sofia road. He compelled the garrison of Dolni-Dubnik to&nbsp;retire into Plevna, and captured Gorni Dubnik and Telis with&nbsp;their garrisons after severe fighting on Oct. 24th and 28th.&nbsp;Osman’s force was thereby reduced by 12 battalions. About&nbsp;the middle of November the opposing forces were distributed&nbsp;as follows: 6 divisions along the Lorn, under the Cesarevich,&nbsp;facing Suleiman’s army; 3 divisions holding the Shipka under&nbsp;Radetzky; 1 division at Lovcha; 2 j divisions west of the Vid&nbsp;under Gurko; and 12 divisions east of the Vid, investing Plevna.&nbsp;The XIV. Corps was in the Dobrudja, the VII. Corps about&nbsp;Odessa and the X. Corps in the Crimea.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">On the Turkish side Suleiman advanced across the Lorn, leaving small garrisons in the fortresses, and attacked at Mechka&nbsp;on Nov. 19th, and at Mechka and Tristenik on Nov.&nbsp;26th, and again on Dec. 12th, but each time without&nbsp;success, and he retired across the Lorn. South of the</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Balkans Vessil Pasha had succeeded Reouf Pasha on the Shipka. He continued to contain the three Russian divisions&nbsp;there, but made no attempt to dislodge them, beyond small&nbsp;offensive demonstrations made with the object of concealing&nbsp;the departure of large drafts which were sent to Sofia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At Sofia and Orkhanie, the Turks were forming an army of recruits and reservists with the object of advancing to the&nbsp;relief of Osman. Mehemet Ali was entrusted with the command.&nbsp;Osman had already asked the sultan’s permission to evacuate&nbsp;Plevna, with* a view to co-operating with Mehemet Ali, but&nbsp;permission was refused. It was not till the investment was&nbsp;completed that the sultan changed his mind, too late, and gave&nbsp;his sanction to the move. The Russians received information&nbsp;of Mehemet Ali’s intended advance, and as the force round&nbsp;Plevna amounted to 191 battalions, 120 squadrons and 650 guns,&nbsp;it was decided that Gurko should move with his detachment&nbsp;towards Sofia. He concentrated his force at Yablonitza on&nbsp;Nov. 5th and succeeded in driving the Turkish advanced&nbsp;guard from Orkhanie. Mehemet Ali now occupied a strong&nbsp;position covering the Arabi Konak Pass over the Balkans, and,&nbsp;with a force of 43 battalions with cavalry and guns, made&nbsp;no attempt to relieve Osman.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Osman Pasha, his supplies having given out, eventually decided on a sortie. His troops had been short of food since&nbsp;the beginning of November, and the number of sick&nbsp;had risen to 10,000. His plan was to break through&nbsp;to the west and make for Sofia via Berkovitz. The&nbsp;Russians observed the preparations made and concentrated sufficient force at the threatened point, with&nbsp;the result that Osman and his army of 40,000 men&nbsp;capitulated. The Turkish losses in the action were&nbsp;about 6000 and the Russians lost about 1500. The</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Russians now decided, notwithstanding the difficulties due to the winter season, to push on across the Balkans. The&nbsp;VII. and X. Corps were still left guarding the Russian coasts.&nbsp;The Cesarevich was left north of the Balkans with 71,000&nbsp;men to guard the communications. Gurko’s force w<sup>r</sup>as&nbsp;raised to 80,000. Leaving a containing force to oppose&nbsp;the Turks at the Arabi Konak Pass positions, he crossed by&nbsp;the Curiak Pass. The Turks retired unobserved, and after&nbsp;a feeble stand at Tashkosen retreated to Kustendil. Gurko&nbsp;occupied Sofia on Jan. 4th. Radetzky’s force at the Shipka&nbsp;was raised to 66,000, with which force, having defeated Vessil&nbsp;Pasha, he was to join Gurko south of the Balkans. Radetzky&nbsp;commenced operations on Jan. 5th. Keeping one division&nbsp;to hold the works on the Shipka, he moved the remainder&nbsp;of the force in two columns under Skobelev and Prince Mirski,&nbsp;who were to cross one on each side and attack simultaneously&nbsp;from the south. Vessil Pasha held an entrenched camp at&nbsp;Shenovo with some 12,000 men; the remainder of his force&nbsp;was in position on the mountains. Owing to the difficulties&nbsp;of the crossing, Skobelev was delayed. Mirski attacked on</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Jan. 8th and was repulsed. The following day Skobelev and Mirski attacking together were successful, and Vessil Pasha&nbsp;capitulated with his force/some 36,000, of whom 6000 were sick&nbsp;and wounded. Vessil Pasha had pointed out the danger of&nbsp;his position on Jan. 7th, but, contrary to Suleiman’s advice,&nbsp;the war minister, believing an armistice imminent, had ordered&nbsp;him to hold on to the Shipka Pass. Mehemet Ali’s force,&nbsp;dangerously delayed owing to interference by the minister&nbsp;of war, eventually reached Tatar-Bazardjik, which was selected&nbsp;by Suleiman (now commander-in-chief) for the concentration&nbsp;of his forces. Having received news of the capture of the&nbsp;Shipka force he retired on Philippopolis, with Gurko’s forces&nbsp;closely pursuing. But Radetzky’s forces had already pushed&nbsp;on and practically cut Suleiman off from Adrianople. After&nbsp;some engagements about Philippopolis on Jan. 15th, 16th and&nbsp;17th, he retreated towards the Aegean Sea through the Rhodope&nbsp;mountains, having lost most of his guns, and reached Enos&nbsp;about Jan. 28th, whence what remained of his force was conveyed by water to Constantinople.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Suleiman had again missed his opportunity. The Russians crossed the Balkans in a wide front of about 180 miles, and&nbsp;there was opportunity for successful action by a capable commander.. There were not only the columns commanded by&nbsp;Gurko and Radetzky, but also a third column under General&nbsp;Kartzoff, which crossed by the Trojan Pass, after which it&nbsp;joined Gurko’s force. There were the troops under Mehemet&nbsp;Ali about Sofia, Vessil Pasha’s force about the Shipka, and&nbsp;the main army on the Lorn, which had been withdrawn south&nbsp;of the Balkans after the fall of Plevna, so that Suleiman, who&nbsp;had been appointed commander-in-chief, had an available&nbsp;force of 130 battalions, 120 guns and a proportion of cavalry.&nbsp;The fortified town of Adrianople offered a strong central&nbsp;position at which to concentrate his forces, and with this point&nbsp;as support, acting on interior lines, he could have dealt with&nbsp;the invading and widely separated columns in detail. But&nbsp;he missed his opportunity and left his scattered forces to be&nbsp;overwhelmed by superior numbers in each instance. The&nbsp;minister for war was undoubtedly responsible to a great extent&nbsp;for this faulty strategy, but the blame falls on the bead of&nbsp;Suleiman as commander-in-chief. There was no object in&nbsp;leaving Vessil Pasha on the Shipka. All available forces&nbsp;should have been concentrated in a sound strategical situation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Servians had crossed the frontier after the fall of Plevna, and the Montenegrins were also pressing on. On Jan. 16 th&nbsp;the Russians occupied Adrianople, and on Jan. 30th they were&nbsp;facing the Buyuk Tchemedji lines, with their flanks resting&nbsp;on the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmora. Mehemet Ali&nbsp;was in command of what remained of the Turkish armies&nbsp;behind the lines. On Jan. 31st an armistice was arranged,&nbsp;and on March 3rd the treaty of San Stefano was signed, the&nbsp;terms of which were modified later at the Berlin Conference&nbsp;in June and July 1878.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The Russo-Turkish War proved once for all the great value of improvised fortifications, in other words, of spade work in&nbsp;warfare, and the advantages of field works as regards invisibility&nbsp;against artillery fire. It was not only at Plevna that field&nbsp;intrenchments were made use of. Notable instances were&nbsp;the defence of Lovcha by the small Turkish garrison of 8&nbsp;battalions with one battery, which from their entrenchments&nbsp;kept Skobelev with over 20,000 men and 90 guns at bay for&nbsp;three days, inflicting on him a loss of over 1500 men. Again,&nbsp;at Gomi Dubnik on Oct. 24th, 3500 Turks with 4 guns held&nbsp;their works throughout the day against 20,000 Russians with&nbsp;60 guns, inflicting a loss on them of over 3300, and eventually&nbsp;were forced to surrender by a surprise attack under cover&nbsp;of darkness, when their ammunition had run short, and their&nbsp;numbers had been reduced by 1500 casualties. In the attack&nbsp;the success of Skobelev stands out, and we find that he had&nbsp;realized the necessity of intrenching the ground he had gained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The war was brought to a conclusion, but the Turks had not been beaten in battle. With the exception of the fighting&nbsp;round Plevna and the rout of Suleiman’s army at Philippopolis</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
