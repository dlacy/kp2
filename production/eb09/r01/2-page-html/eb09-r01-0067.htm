<p><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">scoPy);</span><span class="font2"> some are produced by the permanent gases, others by aqueous vapour, which is always present, though in&nbsp;variable amount. The absorption-spectrum of water-vapour has been minutely studied and carefully mapped&nbsp;by Janssen and by Cornu. In Angstrom’s table of normal&nbsp;solar spectra there are numerous groups of lines which&nbsp;appeared most conspicuous when the sun was close to the&nbsp;horizon, and many of these are coincident with the absorption-lines of water-vapour. They are found principally in&nbsp;the red and yellow, and the main group is seen a little to&nbsp;the red side of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span class="font2"> line. In small spectroscopes the&nbsp;water-vapour lines appear fused together into a band on&nbsp;the red side of </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">D,</span><span class="font2"> or even as a mere widening of that line.&nbsp;There are several variable bands in the spectrum which&nbsp;come to a maximum of intensity when the sun is on the&nbsp;horizon. These are due to absorption by the permanent&nbsp;gases; the one which in a small instrument appears to&nbsp;separate the yellow from the green is frequently mistaken&nbsp;for the water-vapour band, and this is the cause of many&nbsp;incorrect “ rainband predictions.” In 1872 Professor Piazzi&nbsp;Smyth noticed a change in the water-vapour lines before and&nbsp;after a sirocco in Palermo, and the same phenomenon was&nbsp;brought before him very strikingly in France before great&nbsp;rains in 1875 </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Edin. Ast. Obs.,</span><span class="font2"> vol. xiv.), when he named&nbsp;the main group of water-vapour lines the “ rainband.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The rainband may be observed with any spectroscope, but direct-vision instruments of medium size are most convenient. It is important that the spectroscope should have as great dispersion as possible and good definition, especially at the red end. To make&nbsp;an observation the slit, which must be kept perfectly clean, should be&nbsp;narrowed down until the spectral lines are sharp and clear. The&nbsp;instrument should be carefully focused to get the maximum absorption effect ; but all observers lay stress on noting whether the&nbsp;intensity of the band decreases rapidly or gradually as the altitude&nbsp;is increased. When a dark band is observed at the horizon and at&nbsp;the zenith, heavy rain is almost certain to follow immediately. It&nbsp;is of little importance whether the sky be clear or covered with&nbsp;high clouds at the point of observation ; low clouds or haze make&nbsp;the result untrustworthy by shortening the line of sight, thus&nbsp;reducing the strength of the band and equalizing it in all directions.&nbsp;The utility of the spectroscope in meteorology depends on its power&nbsp;of investigating the hygrometrical conditions of the whole slice of&nbsp;atmosphere looked through, and it affords a means of ascertaining&nbsp;the difference of humidity in different directions. The hygrometer&nbsp;only indicates the state, as regards moisture, of the few yards of&nbsp;air surrounding it. The great difficulty in the way of obtaining&nbsp;accurate results with the rainband spectroscope has been the mental&nbsp;scale of comparison employed by most observers. Although some&nbsp;have found it easy to estimate the intensity of the band from 0 to&nbsp;20, it is beyond the power of many to describe it in figures even&nbsp;from 0 to 5. Professor Piazzi Smyth noted its strength relatively&nbsp;to that of the dry-air band between the green and yellow. The&nbsp;fixed solar lines </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">E, b,</span><span class="font1"> and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">F</span><span class="font1"> have been used as a closer approximation to a scale in instruments not powerful enough to separate&nbsp;the rainband from the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span class="font1"> line. This compound line appears to&nbsp;vary from something less intense than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span class="font1"> in very dry weather to&nbsp;something considerably darker than </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">F</span><span class="font1"> when rain is imminent.&nbsp;Seven degrees can be discerned, and these may be represented by&nbsp;using the sign = to mean “of equal intensity with,” &gt; to mean&nbsp;“darker than,” and &lt; “less dark than,” as, &lt;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">E,=E, &gt;E&lt;b,&nbsp;= b,&gt;b&lt;F, = F,</span><span class="font1"> and &gt;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">F.</span><span class="font1"> When the thin solar lines in the green&nbsp;are seen very distinctly there is less probability of rain falling than&nbsp;when they are indistinct or invisible.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">It appears that the average percentage of fulfilments of predictions of “rain” and “no rain,” made for a period of twelve hours after&nbsp;one observation in the morning, which may be expected in Scotland&nbsp;is about 75. In less variable climates, such as those of the south&nbsp;of Europe and parts of the United States, a much higher degree of&nbsp;accuracy has been attained. The precise strength of rainband&nbsp;which corresponds to the probability of a fall of rain within a&nbsp;definite time depends on the temperature and also on the place of&nbsp;observation ; in every case it must be determined by the observer&nbsp;for himself. Very dark rainbands are found to precede rain in&nbsp;more than 95 per cent, of the cases everywhere ; entire, or almost&nbsp;entire, absence of the band presages a dry day with equal probability. With a spectroscope powerful enough to split </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">1)</span><span class="font1"> a mental&nbsp;numerical scale must be used in default of a suitable micrometer,&nbsp;and by practice the observer will be able to draw up a table for its&nbsp;conversion into probabilities of rain.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The production of an artificial absorption-line the intensity of which could be varied by known degrees suggested itself to more&nbsp;than one observer as the principle for a rainband-micrometer. A&nbsp;wedge of didymium glass comes very near success in this direction,&nbsp;but the absorption-line is awkwardly situated. Professor Cook of&nbsp;Dartmouth College, the leading meteorological spectroscopist in&nbsp;the United States, has constructed a micrometer for </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> spectroscope&nbsp;of sufficient power to separate the rainband into lines. A silk&nbsp;fibre is fixed to a frame capable of being moved to and fro in the&nbsp;tube of the spectroscope by a micrometer screw<sup>7</sup>. When brought&nbsp;into focus the fibre appears as two sharp lines, which become fainter&nbsp;and w<sup>τ</sup>ider as it is withdrawn. When the lines appear of equal&nbsp;intensity with the most prominent line of the rainband (α of the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">D</span><span class="font1"> group in Janssen’s map) the micrometer is read ; forty shades of&nbsp;intensity may be indicated by it. The unit proposed for graduating&nbsp;such micrometers on a uniform scale is the intensity of the faintest&nbsp;and least refrangible of a group of three lines in the red (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">w. l.</span><span class="font1"> 6207)&nbsp;of the spectrum produced by a 1 centimètre column of the gas&nbsp;given off' by heated lead nitrate (mixture of nitrogen peroxide and&nbsp;oxygen) at 25° C. and 760 mm. The spectroscope when reinforced&nbsp;by this micrometer has been found to indicate with unfailing accuracy the existence in certain parts of the sky of banks of invisible&nbsp;cloud, which become visible when a fall of temperature and other&nbsp;necessary conditions allow the vapour to condense. In settled&nbsp;weather such masses of vapour are not to be found, the micrometer&nbsp;readings being the same in all directions at the same altitude.&nbsp;Sometimes the rainband grows gradually darker for several days&nbsp;before a period of steady and long-continued rain, while sudden&nbsp;violent showers may give very short notice.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The spectroscopic history of a thunderstorm observed on 9th June 1884 by Professor Cook is extremely interesting. During&nbsp;its approach the water-vapour line observed at 10° north of the&nbsp;zenith towards the storm was darker by ten degrees of the scale&nbsp;than that observed 10° south of the zenith, although to the eye&nbsp;the clouds presented exactly the same appearance at both places.&nbsp;On this occasion the strength of the line varied as follows :—</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RAINGAUGE </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">(Pluviometer, Hyetometer, Udometer).</span><span class="font2"> The value of the measurement of rainfall (see </span><span class="font3" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Meteorology)</span><span class="font2"> has long been understood, although it is&nbsp;only within the last hundred years that trustworthy results&nbsp;have been obtained. Marriotte is claimed as the originator&nbsp;of the raingauge in 1677. The simplest form is an open&nbsp;vessel of uniform diameter exposed to the rain, in which&nbsp;the depth of water collected during any interval of time&nbsp;may be measured. In order to reduce evaporation the&nbsp;mouth of the gauge is usually a funnel of the same diameter&nbsp;as the vessel ; and some means, such as an external narrow&nbsp;glass tube graduated in inches and parts to show the&nbsp;height of the water inside, or a float bearing a graduated&nbsp;rod, or, in more delicate forms, a movable scale which may&nbsp;be set by a vernier to the surface of the water, is adopted&nbsp;to facilitate measurement. Raingauges on this plan cannot be very accurate ; their one advantage is that the area&nbsp;of the collecting surface does not require to be known.&nbsp;The disadvantages are that so much water is required to&nbsp;wet the sides of the vessel as to make the instrument read&nbsp;too low when a side tube is used, and the tube is liable to</span></p>
