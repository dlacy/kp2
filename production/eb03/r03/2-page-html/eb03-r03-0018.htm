        <p><span class="font0">truck of the top carriage be to tuat of another truck fixed to the
                ſledge, in the proportion of the velocity of&nbsp;the top to that of the ſledge. Let
                a mark be made on&nbsp;the rim of each ; let the man at the ſledge make a ſignal
                every time that the mark on the ſledge truck is up-permoft. The mark on the carriage
                truck ſhould be&nbsp;uppermoſt at the ſame inſtant ; and in this way
                the&nbsp;foreman knows the ſtate of the rope at all times without quitting his
                llation. Thus, in making a cable of&nbsp;120 fathoms, it is ufiιal to warp the yarns
                l8o fathoms,&nbsp;and to harden them up to 140 before doling. Therefore, in the
                cloſing, the top muſt move 140 fathoms,&nbsp;and the ſledge only 20. The diameter of
                the carriage&nbsp;truck ſhould therefore be ſeven times the diameter or&nbsp;the
                ſledge truck.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">We have hitherto proceeded on the ſuppofition, that the twiſt
                produced by the cranks is propagated freely&nbsp;along the ſtrands and along the
                cloſing rope. But&nbsp;this is not the cafe.. It is almoſt unavoidable that
                the&nbsp;twiſt is greater in the neighbourhood of the crank&nbsp;which produces it.
                The ſtrands are frequently of very&nbsp;conſiderable weight, and lie heavy on the
                flakes. Force&nbsp;is therefore neceſſary to overcome their friction, and it&nbsp;is
                only the overplus that is propagated beyond the ſtake.&nbsp;It is proper to lift
                them up from time to time, and let&nbsp;them fall down again, as the ſawer does with
                his&nbsp;marking line. This helps the twiſt to run along the&nbsp;ſtrand. But this
                is not enough for the cloſed rope,&nbsp;which is of much greater weight, and much
                ſtiſſer.—&nbsp;When the top approaches the tackle-board, the heaving&nbsp;at the
                Hedge could not can e the ſtrands immediately behind the top to dole well, without
                *having previouſly&nbsp;produced an extravagant degree of twiſt in the intermediate
                rope. The effort of the crank muſt therefore&nbsp;be aſſiſted by men ſtationed along
                the rope, each ſur-niihed -with a tool, called a </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">vaoolcter.</span><span class="font0"> This is a ſtout
                oak&nbsp;flick about three feet long, having a ſtrap of ſoft rope-yarn or cordage
                fattened on its middle or end. The&nbsp;'ſtrap is wrapped round the laid rope, and
                the workman&nbsp;works with the ſtick as a lever, twilling the rope round&nbsp;in
                the direction of the crank’s motion. The woolders&nbsp;ſhould keep their eye on the
                men at the crank, and&nbsp;make their motion correſpond with his. Thus
                they&nbsp;ſend forward the twiſt produced by the crank, without&nbsp;either
                increaſing or diminiſhing. it, in that part cf the&nbsp;rope which lies between them
                and the Hedge.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">It is uſual before taking the rope ſtom the hooks to heave a while at
                the ſledge end, in order to harden the <sup>,&nbsp;</sup>rope a little. They do this
                ſo as to take it up about&nbsp;∙<sub>δ</sub><sup>l</sup><sub>δ</sub>-. The propriety
                or Impropriety of this practice de-peπdsbentirely on the proportion which has been
                previouſly obſerved between tiιe hardening of the ſtrands and&nbsp;the twiſting of
                the cloſing rope. It is, in all cafes,&nbsp;better to adjuſt theſe preciſely, and
                then nothing remains to be done when the top has arrived at the upper&nbsp;end of
                the walk. The making of two ſtrand and three&nbsp;ſtrand line pointed out the
                principle which ſhould be&nbsp;attended to in this,caſe ; namely, that the twiſt
                given&nbsp;to the rope in laying ſhould be preciſely what a perfectly ſoſt rope
                would give to itſelf. We do not fee&nbsp;any reaſon for thinking that the proportion
                between the&nbsp;number of turns given to the ſtrands and the number&nbsp;of turns
                given to the laid line by its own elaſticity, will&nbsp;vary by any difference of
                diameter. We would therefore recommend t© the artiſts to fettle this
                proportion&nbsp;by experiment. lhe line ſhould be made of tne ſineſt,&nbsp;ſmalleſt,
                and ſofteft threads or yarn. Theſe ſhould be&nbsp;made into ſtrands, and the ſtrands
                ſhould be hardened up in the direction ’contrary to the ſpinning twiſt.&nbsp;The
                rope ſhould then be laid, hanging perpendicularly,&nbsp;with a ſmall weight on the
                top to keep it down, and a&nbsp;very ſmall weight at the end of the rope. The number
                of turns given to the ſtrands ſhould be carefully&nbsp;noticed', and the number of
                turns which the rope takes&nbsp;of itſelf in cloſing. T<sup>1</sup>ne weight ſhould
                then be taken&nbsp;off, and the rope will make a dew turns more. This&nbsp;whole
                number will never exceed what is neceſſary for&nbsp;the equilibrium ; and we imagine
                it will not fall much&nbsp;ſhort of it. We are clearly of opinion an exact
                ad-juſtment of this particular will tend greatly to improve&nbsp;the art of
                rope-making, and that experiments on good'&nbsp;principles for aſcertaimng this
                proportion would be&nbsp;highly valuable, becauſe there is no point about
                which&nbsp;the artiſts themſelves differ more in their
                opinions'and&nbsp;practice.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The cordage, of which we have been describing the manufacture, is
                ſaid to be hawser-laid. It is not&nbsp;uncommon to make ropes of four llra'nd6.
                Theſe are&nbsp;uſed for lhrouds, and this cordage is therefore
                called&nbsp;shroud-laid cordage. A rope of the lame fize and&nbsp;weight mnſt be
                ſmoother when it has four ſtrands, be-caute the ſtrands are ſmaller : hut it is more
                difficult&nbsp;to lay cloſe. When three cylindrical ſtrands are limply&nbsp;laid
                together, they leave a vaciiity at the axis amounting&nbsp;to √-<sub>g</sub>- of the
                ſection of a ſtrand. This is to be filled&nbsp;up by compreſſing the ſtrands by
                twiſting them. Each&nbsp;muſt fill up ſ of it by changing its ſhape ; and 4 of
                this&nbsp;change is made on each fide of the ſtrand. The greateſt change of ſhape
                therefore made on any one part of&nbsp;a ſtrand amounts only to
                    <sub>τ</sub>⅛-<sub>5</sub>∙ of the ſection of the&nbsp;ſtrand. The vacuity
                between four cylinders is √<sub>τ</sub> of&nbsp;one of them. This being divided into
                eight parts, is&nbsp;√<sub>5</sub>- of a ilrand, and is the greateſt compreſſion
                which&nbsp;any part of it has to undergo. This is nearly five times&nbsp;greater
                than the former, and muſt be more difficult to&nbsp;produce. Indeed it may be ſeen
                by looking at the figures 11. and 12. that it will be eafier to compreſs
                a&nbsp;ſtrand into the obtuſe angle of .120 degrees than into&nbsp;the right angle
                of 90 ; and without reaſoning more&nbsp;about the matter, it appears that the
                difficulty will increaſe w<sup>τ</sup>ith the number of ſtrands. Sixdlrands
                muſt&nbsp;touch each other, and form an arch leaving a hollow in&nbsp;the middle,
                into which one of the ſtrands will flip, and&nbsp;then the reſt will not completely
                furround it. Such a&nbsp;rope would be uneven on the ſurface. It would be&nbsp;weak
                ; becauſe the central ſtrand would be ſlack in&nbsp;compariſon of the reſt, and
                would not be exerting its&nbsp;whole force when they are juſt ready to break.
                We&nbsp;fee then that a four ſtrand rope muſt be more difficult&nbsp;to lay well
                than a hawſer-laid rope. With care, however, they may be laid well and cloſe, and
                are much&nbsp;uſed in the royal navy.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Ropes, aie made of four ſtrands, with a heart or ſtrand in the
                middle. This gives no additional ſtrength,:&nbsp;for the reaſon juſt now given. Its
                only uſe is to make’&nbsp;the work better and more eaſy, and to ſupport all
                the&nbsp;ſtrands at the ſame diſtance from the axis of the rope.&nbsp;This is of
                great conſequence ; becauſe when they are&nbsp;at unequal diſtances from the axis,
                ſome muſt be more&nbsp;doping than.others, and they will not reſiſt alike.
