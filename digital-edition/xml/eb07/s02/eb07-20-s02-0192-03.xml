a district of Hindustan, in the province of Bahar, situated principally between the 25th and 26th degrees of north latitude. It has the Ganges on the north, Rotas and Bahar on the south, the district of Bahar on the east, and Chunar and Rotas on the west. This is a populous and fertile country, particularly in the northern quarter, which is watered by the Ganges and the Soane. In answer to queries circulated by the Marquis Wellesley to the collectors of the districts in 1801, it appeared that the population amounted to two millions, in the proportion of one Mahommedan to twenty Hindus. The principal towns are Buxar, Boujepoor, and Arrah ; and the chief rivers are the Ganges, Soane, and Caramnassa.</p></div></body></text></TEI>
