<p><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Volterra, was born in 1509, and studied painting under Razzi and Peruzzi. The young artist, settling in Rome,&nbsp;strove most unweariedly to attain eminence in his profession. No efforts were spared on his pictures, lie proceeded with a careful slowness, attempting to reach his&nbsp;ideal by a close imitation of Michelangelo. It is even said&nbsp;that he sometimes in a difficulty had recourse to the more&nbsp;direct aid of that great master’s own hand. The result of&nbsp;this earnest labour was that Ricciarelli obtained abundant encouragement. His constant friend, Michelangelo,&nbsp;recommended him on all possible occasions. He had the&nbsp;honour to beautify with works of art a chapel in the&nbsp;church of the Trinità, to paint in the Farnese Palace, to&nbsp;execute certain decorations in the Palazzo de’ Medici at&nbsp;Navona, and to begin the stucco work and the pictures in&nbsp;the Hall of the Kings. Nor was he less highly patronized&nbsp;when, towards the close of his life, he turned his attention to statuary. His last work was a bronze horse&nbsp;intended for an equestrian statue of Henry II. of France.&nbsp;He died in 1566. The principal extant works of Ricciarelli are at Rome. These are a St John the Baptist&nbsp;in the picture gallery of the Capitol, a Saviour bearing&nbsp;the Cross in the Palazzo Rosρigliosi, and a Descent from&nbsp;the Cross, his masterpiece, in the church of Trinità de&nbsp;Monti. There is also an Elijah at Volterra.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICCOBONI, Madame (1714-1792), whose maiden name was Marie Jeanne Laboras de Mézières, and who&nbsp;married and was deserted by an actor and author of little&nbsp;merit, was born at Paris in 1714. She herself was an&nbsp;actress, but did not succeed on the stage. She then took&nbsp;to novel writing and deserves a considerable place in the&nbsp;history of the sentimental novel. Her first work was the&nbsp;remarkable </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire du Marquis de Cressy</span><span class="font1"> (1758). This&nbsp;was followed by </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Milady Catesby, Fanny Butler</span><span class="font1"> (both of&nbsp;them, as indeed are almost all her books, in letter form),&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ernestine</span><span class="font1"> (sometimes thought her masterpiece), three&nbsp;series of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Lettres</span><span class="font1"> in the names of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Adelaide de Dammartin&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">(often quoted as </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Madame de Sancerre), Elizabeth Sophie de&nbsp;Valliere, Milord Rivers,</span><span class="font1"> and others. These books were&nbsp;much admired, but brought their author little money.&nbsp;She obtained, however, a small pension from the crown, but&nbsp;the Revolution deprived her of it, and she died in 1792 in&nbsp;great indigence. Besides the works named she translated&nbsp;Fielding’s </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Amelia,</span><span class="font1"> and tried a continuation (but not the&nbsp;conclusion sometimes erroneously ascribed to her) of&nbsp;Marivaux’s unfinished </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Marianne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All Madame Rieeoboni’s work is very clever, and there is real pathos in it. But it is among the most eminent examples of the&nbsp;“ sensibility ” novel, of which no examples but Sterne’s have kept&nbsp;their place in England, and that not in virtue of their sensibility.&nbsp;A still nearer parallel may be found in the work of Mackenzie.&nbsp;Madame Riccoboni is an especial offender in the use of mechanical&nbsp;aids to impressiveness—italics, dashes, rows of points, and the like.&nbsp;The principal edition of her complete works is that of Paris,&nbsp;1818. The chief novels appear in a volume of Garnier’s Bibliothèque Amusante, Paris, 1865.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">RICE. According to Roxburgh the cultivated rice with all its numerous varieties has originated from a wild&nbsp;plant called in India Newaree or Nivara </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">{Oryza saliva).&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">It is said to grow on the borders of lakes in the Circars&nbsp;and elsewhere in India, and is also native in tropical&nbsp;Australia. The rice plant is an annual grass with long&nbsp;linear glabrous leaves, each provided with a long sharply-pointed ligule. The spikelets are borne on a compound&nbsp;or branched spike, erect at first but afterwards bent downwards. Each spikelet contains a solitary flower with two&nbsp;outer small glumes and two inner, larger and folded&nbsp;lengthwise, the outer one of the two rather larger and&nbsp;sometimes provided with an awn. Within these are six&nbsp;stamens, a hairy ovary surmounted by two feathery styles&nbsp;which ripens into the fruit (grain), and which is invested&nbsp;by the husk formed by the persistent glumes. The cultivated varieties are extremely numerous, some kinds being&nbsp;adapted for marshy land, others for growth on the hill-sides.&nbsp;The cultivators make two principal divisions according as&nbsp;the sorts are early or late. Other subdivisions depend&nbsp;upon the habit of the plant, the presence or absence of an&nbsp;awn, the colour of the grain, and other particulars. Rice&nbsp;has been cultivated from time immemorial in tropical&nbsp;countries. According to Stanislas Julien a ceremonial&nbsp;ordinance was established in China by the emperor Chin-nung 2800 years B.c., in accordance with which the&nbsp;emperor sows the rice himself while the seeds of four&nbsp;other kinds may be sown by the princes of his family.&nbsp;This fact, joined to other considerations, induced Alphonse&nbsp;de Candolle to consider rice as a native of China. It was&nbsp;very early culti</span></p>

Ricp&nbsp;was first cultivated in Italy near Pisa in 1468. It was&nbsp;not introduced into Carolina until 1700, and then, as it&nbsp;is said, by accident, although at one time the southern&nbsp;United States furnished a large proportion of the rice&nbsp;introduced into commerce. Rice, says Crawfurd, sports&nbsp;into far more varieties than any of the corns familiar&nbsp;to Europeans, for some varieties grow in the water and&nbsp;some on dry land ; some come to maturity in three&nbsp;months, while others take four and six months to do&nbsp;so. The Hindus, however, are not content with such&nbsp;broad distinctions as might be derived from these obvious&nbsp;sources, but have names for varieties the distinctions&nbsp;between which are unappreciable by Europeans ; besides&nbsp;terms for this corn founded on variety, on season, and&nbsp;on mode of culture, the grain itself bears one name in&nbsp;the straw, another when threshed, one name in the husk&nbsp;and another when freed from it, and a fifth when cooked.&nbsp;A similar abundance of terms is found in the languages of&nbsp;the Malay and Philippine Islands.
