<p><span class="font1">It was neceſſary to premiſe theſe facts in hydraulics, that we may be able in every caſe to diſtinguiſh between the force expended in the entry of the water&nbsp;into the conduit or canal, and the force employed in&nbsp;overcoming the reſiſtances along the canal, and in pre-ſerving or accelerating its motion in it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The motion of running water is produced by two cauſes ; I. The action of gravity; and, 2. The mobility of the particles, which makes them aſſume a level&nbsp;in confined veſſels, or determines them to move to that&nbsp;fide where there is a defect of preſſure. When the ſur-face is level, every particle is at reſt, being equally preſ-ſed in all directions ; but if the ſurface 13 not level, not&nbsp;only does a particle on the very ſurface tend by its own&nbsp;weight towards the lower ſide, as a body would Aide&nbsp;along an inclined plane, but there is a force, external to&nbsp;itſelf, ariſing from a ſuperiority of preſſure on the upper -end of the ſurface, which puſhes this ſuperficial particle towards the lower end ; and this is not peculiar to&nbsp;the ſuperficial particles, but affects every particle within the maſs of water. In the veſſel ACHE fſig. 6. ),&nbsp;containing water with an inclined ſurface AE, if </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">we&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">ſuppoſe all frozen but the extreme columns AKHB,&nbsp;FGLE, and a connecting portion HKCDLG, it is&nbsp;evident, from hydroſtatical laws, that the water on this&nbsp;connecting part will be puſhed in the direction CD ;&nbsp;and if the frozen maſs BHGF were moveable, it would&nbsp;alſo be puſhed along. Giving it fluidity will make no&nbsp;change in this reſpect ; and it is indifferent what is the&nbsp;ſituation and ſhape of the connecting column or columns. The propelling force (MNF being horizontal)&nbsp;is the weight of the column AMNB. The ſame thing&nbsp;will obtain wherever we ſelect the vertical columns.&nbsp;There will always be a force tending to puſh every particle of water in the direction of the declivity. The&nbsp;conſequence will be, that the water will link at one end&nbsp;and riſe at the other, and its ſurface will reſt in the horizontal poſition </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span class="font1"> O </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e,</span><span class="font1"> cutting the former in its middle&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">O. </span><span class="font1">This cannot be unleſs there be not only a motion&nbsp;of perpendicular deſcent and aſcent of the vertical columns, but alſo a real motion of tranſlation from K towards L. It perhaps exceeds our mathematical ſlcill to&nbsp;tell what will be the motion of each particle. Newton&nbsp;did not attempt it in his inveſtigation of the motion of&nbsp;waves, nor is it at all neceſſary here. We may, however, acquire a very diſtinct notion of its general effect.&nbsp;Let OPQJre a vertical plane paſſing through the middle&nbsp;point O. It is evident that every particle in PQ, ſuch&nbsp;f,s P, is preſſed in the direction QD, with a force equal&nbsp;to the weight of a ſingle row of particles, whoſe length&nbsp;is the difference between the columns BH and FG.&nbsp;The force acting on the particle Q_is, in like manner,&nbsp;the weight of a row of particles =AC—ED. Now&nbsp;if OQ<sub>j</sub> OA, OE, be divided in the ſame ratio, ſo that&nbsp;all the figures ACDE, BHGF, &amp;c. may be </span><span class="font0">ſimilar,&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">we ſee that the force ariſing ſolely from the declivity, and&nbsp;acting on each particle on the plane is proportional to its depth under the ſurface, and that the row of&nbsp;particles ACQDE, BHPGF, &amp;c. which is to be moved by it, is in the ſame proportion. Hence it un-queſtionably follows, that the accelerating force on each&nbsp;particle of the row is the ſame in all. Therefore the&nbsp;whole plane OQ__ tends to advance forward together&nbsp;with the ſame velocity ; and in the inſtant immediately&nbsp;ſucceeding, all theſe particles would be found again in&nbsp;a vertical plane indefinitely near to OQ; and if we&nbsp;ſum up the forces, we ſhallfind them the ſame as if OQ were the opening of a ſluice, having the water on the&nbsp;ſide of D ſtanding level with O, and the water on the&nbsp;other ſide ſtanding at the height AC. This reſult is&nbsp;extremely different from that of the haſty theory of&nbsp;Gugiielmini. He conſiders each particle in OQ as&nbsp;urged by an accelerating force proportional to its depth,&nbsp;ft is true ; but he makes it </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">equal</span><span class="font1"> to the weight of the&nbsp;row OP, and never recollects that the greateſt part of&nbsp;it is balanced by an oppoſite preſſure, nor perceives that&nbsp;the force which is not balanced muſt be diſtributed&nbsp;among a row of particles which varies in the ſame proportion with itſelf. When theſe two circumſtances are&nbsp;neglected, the reſult muſt be incompatible with obſer-vation. When the balanced forces are taken into the&nbsp;account of preſſure, it is evident that the ſurface may&nbsp;be ſuppoſed horizontal, and that motion ſhould obtain&nbsp;in this caſe as well as in the caſe of a ſloping ſurface :&nbsp;and indeed this is Guglielmini’s profeſſed theory, and&nbsp;what he highly values himſelf on. He announces this&nbsp;diſcovery of a new principle, which he calls the energy&nbsp;of deep waters, as an important addition to hydraulics.&nbsp;It is owing to this, ſays he. that the great rivers are not&nbsp;ſtagnant at their mouths, where they have no perceptible declivity of ſurface, but, on the contrary, have&nbsp;greater energy and velocity than farther up, where they&nbsp;are ſhallower. This principle is the baſis of his improved theory of rivers, and is infiſted on at great length&nbsp;by all the ſubfequent writers. Buffon, in his theory of&nbsp;the earth, makes much uſe of it. We cannot but wonder that it has been allowed a place in the theory of&nbsp;rivers given in the great </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Encyclopédie</span><span class="font1"> of Paris, and in&nbsp;an article having the ſignature (O-) of D’Alembert.&nbsp;We have been very anxious to ſhow the falſity of this&nbsp;principle, becauſe we conſider it as a mere ſubterfuge&nbsp;of Gugiielmini, by which he was able to patch up the&nbsp;mathematical theory which he had ſo haſtily taken from&nbsp;Newton or Galileo ; and we think that we have ſecu-rεd our readers from being miſled by it, when we ſhow&nbsp;that this energy muſt be equally operative when the ſurface 16 on a dead level. The abſurdity of this is evident. We ſhall ſee by and by, that deep waters, when&nbsp;in actual motion, have an energy not to be found in&nbsp;ſhallow running waters, by which they are enabled to&nbsp;continue that motion : but this is not a moving principle ; and it will be fully explained, as an immediate&nbsp;reſult of principles, not vaguely conceived and indi- .&nbsp;ſtinctly expreſſed, like this of Gugliélmini, but eaſily un-derſtood, and appreciable with the greateſt preciſion. It&nbsp;is an energy common t-o all great bodies. Although&nbsp;they lofe as much momentum in ſurmounting any ob-ſtacle as ſmall ones, they loſe but a ſmall portion of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">their velocity.
