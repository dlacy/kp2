<p><span class="font3">the interior against enormous pressure. Thus, in the case of a fish caught at a depth of 4500 ft., the partial pressure of the&nbsp;oxygen present in the swimming bladder at this depth was 127&nbsp;atmospheres, whereas the partial pressure of oxygen in sea-water&nbsp;is only about 0*2 atmosphere. Diffusion can therefore have&nbsp;nothing to do with the passage of gas inwards, which is known to&nbsp;be under the control of the nervous system. The cells lining&nbsp;the interior of the swimming bladder are developed from the&nbsp;same part of the alimentary tract as those lining the air-cells&nbsp;of the lungs, so that it seems not unlikely that the lungs should&nbsp;possess the power of actively secreting or excreting gases. The&nbsp;question whether such a power exists, and is normally exercised,&nbsp;has been investigated by more than one method; and although&nbsp;it is not possible to go into the details of the experiments, there&nbsp;can be no doubt that the balance of the evidence at present&nbsp;available is in favour of the view that diffusion alone is incapable&nbsp;of explaining either the absorption of oxygen or the excretion&nbsp;of carbon dioxide through the lining cells of the lungs. The&nbsp;partial pressure of oxygen appears to be always higher, and of&nbsp;carbon dioxide often lower, in the blood leaving the lungs than&nbsp;in the air of the air-cells; and this result is inconsistent with the&nbsp;diffusion theory. As to the causes of the passage of oxygen and&nbsp;carbonic acid through the walls of the capillaries of the general&nbsp;circulation, we are at present in the dark. Possibly diffusion&nbsp;may explain this process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">II. Although we cannot trace the exact changes which occur when oxygen passes into living cells, yet it is possible to obtain&nbsp;a clear general view of the origin and destiny of the material&nbsp;concerned in the process, and of the physiological conditions&nbsp;which determine it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The oxidizable material within the body consists, practically speaking, of proteids (albumen-like substances, with which the&nbsp;collagen of connective tissue may be included), fats and carbohydrates (sugars and glycogen). AU of these substances contain&nbsp;carbon, hydrogen and oxygen in known, though different,&nbsp;proportions, and the former also contains a known amount&nbsp;of nitrogen and a little sulphur. Nitrogen is constantly leaving&nbsp;the body as urea and other substances in the urine and faeces;&nbsp;and a small but easily measurable proportion of carbon passes&nbsp;off in the same manner. The rest of the carbon passes out as&nbsp;carbon dioxide in respiration. Now carbohydrates and fats&nbsp;are oxidized completely in the body to carbon dioxide and water.&nbsp;This follows from the fact that, practically speaking, no other&nbsp;products into which they might have been converted leave the&nbsp;body except carbon dioxide and water. Moreover, a given&nbsp;weight of carbohydrate requires for its oxidation a definite&nbsp;weight of oxygen, and produces a definite weight of carbon&nbsp;dioxide. There is thus a definite relation between the weight&nbsp;of oxygen used up and the weight of carbon dioxide formed in&nbsp;this oxidation. The same is true for the oxidation of fat and&nbsp;of proteid, allowing in the latter case for the fact that the&nbsp;nitrogen, together with part of the carbon and hydrogen, passes&nbsp;out as urea, &amp;c., in an incompletely oxidized form. From all&nbsp;this it follows that if we measure over a given period (1) the&nbsp;discharge of nitrogen from the body, (2) the intake of oxygen&nbsp;and (3) the output of carbonic acid, we can easily calculate&nbsp;exactly what the ultimate destiny of the oxygen has been, and&nbsp;at the ultimate expense of what material the carbonic acid has&nbsp;been formed. What the intermediate stages may have been we&nbsp;cannot say, but this in no way affects the validity of the calculation. If, during the period of measurement, food is taken, the&nbsp;basis of the calculation is still substantially the same, as the&nbsp;oxidizable material in food consists of practically nothing else&nbsp;except proteids, carbohydrates and fats.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">Liberation of Energy.—</span><span class="font3">From experiments made outside the body, we know that in the oxidation of a given weight of proteid,&nbsp;carbohydrate or fat, a definite amount of energy is liberated.&nbsp;In the article on </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Dietetics</span><span class="font3"> it is shown that precisely the same&nbsp;liberation of energy occurs in the living body, due allowance&nbsp;being made for the fact that the oxidation of proteid is not&nbsp;quite complete. The following table shows the respiratory&nbsp;quotients (the respiratory quotient being the ratio between&nbsp;the volume of carbon dioxide .formed and that of oxygen used&nbsp;up) and energy expressed in units of heat (calories) liberated&nbsp;per gramme of carbon dioxide produced and oxygen consumed&nbsp;in the living body during thc oxidation of proteid, fat and a&nbsp;typical carbohydrate:—</span></p><div>

<p><span class="font3">In the oxidation of non-living substances the rate varies, within wide limits, according to that at which oxygen is&nbsp;supplied. Thus a fire burns the faster the more air is supplied,&nbsp;and the higher the percentage of oxygen in the air. It was for&nbsp;long believed that in the living body also the rate of oxidation&nbsp;must vary according to the oxygen supply. It has been found,&nbsp;however, that this is not the case. Provided that a certain&nbsp;minimum of oxygen is present in the air breâthed, or in&nbsp;the blood supplied to the tissues, it is, practically speaking,&nbsp;indifferent whether the oxygen supply be increased or diminished :&nbsp;only a certain amount is consumed. It might be supposed that&nbsp;the reason for this is that the available oxidizable material in&nbsp;the body is limited, and that if the food supply were increased&nbsp;there would be a corresponding increase in the rate of oxidation.&nbsp;This hypothesis is apparently supported by the fact that,&nbsp;when an increased supply of proteid is given as food, the amount&nbsp;of nitrogen discharged in the urine is almost exactly correspondingly increased, so that evidently the oxidation of proteid&nbsp;increases correspondingly with the supply. Similarly, when&nbsp;carbohydrate food is given, the alteration in the respiratory&nbsp;quotient shows that more carbohydrate than before is being&nbsp;oxidized. Closer investigation in recent times has, however,&nbsp;brought out the very striking fact that, if oxidation be measured&nbsp;in terms of energy liberated by it in the body, it makes hut&nbsp;little difference, other things being equal, whether the animal&nbsp;is fasting or not. If more proteid or carbohydrate is oxidized&nbsp;at one time, correspondingly less fat is oxidized, but the total&nbsp;energy Hberated as heat, &amp;c., in the body is about the same,&nbsp;unless the diet is very excessive, when there is a slight increase&nbsp;of oxidation. Even after many days of starvation, the rate of&nbsp;oxidation per unit of body weight has been found to remain sensibly&nbsp;the same in man. When more food is taken than is required, the&nbsp;excess is stored up, chiefly in the form of fat, into which carbohydrate and possibly also proteid are readily converted in the&nbsp;body. When less food is taken than is needed, the stock of fat is&nbsp;drawn upon, and supplies by far the greater proportion of the&nbsp;energy requirements of the body.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">During the performance of muscular work oxidation is greatly increased, and may amount to ten times the normal or more.&nbsp;Even the slight exertion of easy walking increases oxidation to&nbsp;three times. When the energy represented by the external&nbsp;work done in muscular exertion is compared with the extra&nbsp;energy liberated by oxidation in’the body, it is found, as would&nbsp;be expected, that the latter value largely exceeds the former.&nbsp;In other words, much of the energy Iiberatcd is wasted as heat.&nbsp;Nevertheless the muscles are capable of working with less waste&nbsp;than any steam or gas engine. In the work of climbing, for&nbsp;instance, it has been found in the case of man that 35 % of&nbsp;the energy liberated is represented in the work done in raising&nbsp;the body. Muscular work, if at all excessive, leads to fatigue,&nbsp;and consequent rest. On the other hand, unnatural abstinence&nbsp;from muscular activity leads to restlessness and consequent&nbsp;muscular work. Hence on an average of the twenty-four hours&nbsp;the expenditure of energy by different individuals, with different&nbsp;modes of life, does not as a rule differ greatly.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3">The rate of oxidation per unit of body weight varies considerably according to size and age. If we compare different warmblooded animals, we find that the rate of oxidation is relatively</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
