<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">by Piotrkbw. The area is 4765 square miles. Its southern part stretches over the hilly plateau of Poland, which&nbsp;consists of short ridges of hills from 800 to 2000 feet in&nbsp;height, intersected by deep valleys, and is known as the&nbsp;Sandomir Heights. These heights are thickly wooded;&nbsp;the valleys, running west and east and watered by several&nbsp;tributaries of the Vistula, are excellently adapted for agriculture. Farther north in its central portion the contour of&nbsp;the government is level, the soil fertile, and the surface,&nbsp;which is diversified here and there with wood, is further&nbsp;broken up by occasional spurs, 800 feet in height, of the&nbsp;Lysa G6ra Mountains. The northern districts, where the&nbsp;Pilica joins the Vistula, consist of low flat tracts with&nbsp;undefined valleys, exposed to frequent floods and covered&nbsp;over large areas with marshes; the basin of the Pilica,&nbsp;notorious for its unliealthiness, is throughout a low marshy&nbsp;plain. Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, and Triassic&nbsp;deposits appear in the southern plateau, Chalk and&nbsp;Jurassic in the middle, and Tertiary in the north. Wide&nbsp;tracts are covered with Glacial deposits,—the Scandinavian&nbsp;erratics reaching as far south as Ilza; these last in their&nbsp;turn are covered with widely spreading post-Glacial lacustrine deposits. The Vistula skirts the government on&nbsp;the south and east and is an important means of communication, several hundreds of light boats </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(gcilary)&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">descending the river every year, while steamers ply as far&nbsp;up as S§domierz. The S§domierz district is occasionally&nbsp;exposed to disastrous inundations of the river. The tributaries of the Vistula (Radomka, Kamienna, and several&nbsp;others) are but short and small, while those of the Pilica&nbsp;are mere streams sluggishly flowing amidst marshes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The population (644,830 in 1882) is Polish for the most part, one-seventh being Jews. According to creed the proportions are— Roman Catholic 840־ per cent., Jewish 146־, Protestant 13־, and&nbsp;Greek 0T per cent. The chief occupation of the inhabitants is&nbsp;agriculture, the principal crops being wheat, oats, rye, potatoes,&nbsp;and beetroot (for sugar). Corn is exported and potatoes largely&nbsp;used for distillation. In 1879 there were 148 manufacturing establishments (197 in 1883), employing 1708 hands, with an aggregate&nbsp;production of 2,121,000 roubles (£212,000), the more important&nbsp;being tanneries, flour-mills, sugar-works, and several machinery&nbsp;aud iron-works. These last are suffering, however, from want of&nbsp;wood-fuel, and many of them have recently been closed. Trade is&nbsp;not very extensive, the only channel of commerce being the Vistula.&nbsp;There is no lack of philanthropic institutions within the government (most of them founded early in this century), but nevertheless the sanitary condition of the people is deplorable. </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Plica&nbsp;polonica,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> which is endemic in the government of Radom as well&nbsp;as in that of Kielce, is widely diffused, no fewer than 15,000 persons suffering from it, and cognate maladies, such as goitre, scabies,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">tinea capitis,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> are also widely prevalent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The educational institutions include two lycees or gymnasia and two progymnasia (all at Radom), with 813 male and 287 female&nbsp;pupils, a normal school, a theological seminary at Sandomir, and&nbsp;170 primary schools (112 in villages), with 8465 scholars.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The government is divided into eight districts, the chief towns of which are—Radom, Ilza (2750), Konsk (6275), Kozienice (5690),&nbsp;Opatow (5200), Opoczno (5585), and Sgdomierz or Sandomir (6265,&nbsp;or 14,710 including suburbs). Zavihvost (3700) is an important&nbsp;custom-house. Ostrowiec (5290), Staszow (6910), Przedborz (6345),&nbsp;and Szidlowiec (5290) have municipal institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RADOM, capital of the above government, situated on the Mleczna, a tributary of the Radomka, 65 miles south&nbsp;from Warsaw, is one of the best-built provincial towns of&nbsp;Poland. Lublin Street has a number of fine shops, and&nbsp;there are two well-kept public gardens. The permanent&nbsp;population in 1882 was 12,970, half of whom were Jews,&nbsp;and the town is rapidly growing towards the south-east.&nbsp;Though an old town, Radom has no interesting antiquities.&nbsp;The church of St Wlaclaw, contemporary with the foundation of the town, was transformed by the Austrians into a&nbsp;storehouse, and subsequently by the Russian Government&nbsp;into a military prison. The old castle is in ruins, and the&nbsp;old Bernardine monastery is now used as barracks. The&nbsp;manufactures are unimportant, but trade has been lately&nbsp;increasing.</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Radom, which is mentioned in historical documents of the year 1216, at that time occupied the site of what is now Old Radom.&nbsp;New Radom was founded in 1340 by Casimir the Great. Here&nbsp;Jadwiga was elected queen of Poland in 1382, and here too in&nbsp;1401 the first act relating to the union of Poland with Lithuania&nbsp;was signed ; the “seim ” of 1505, where the organic law of Poland&nbsp;was sworn by the king, was also held at Radom. Several great&nbsp;fires, and still more the Swedish War, were the ruin of the old city.&nbsp;After the third partition of Poland it fell under Austrian rule;&nbsp;later on, in 1809, it became capital of the Radom department of&nbsp;the grand-duchy of Warsaw. In 1815 it was annexed to Russia&nbsp;and became chief town of the province of Sandomir.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">RAEBURN, </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Sir Henry </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">(1756-1823), portrait-painter, was born at Stockbridge, a suburb of Edinburgh, on&nbsp;the 4th of March 1756, the son of a manufacturer of&nbsp;the city. He was early left an orphan. Being placed in&nbsp;Heriot’s Hospital, he received there the elements of a sound&nbsp;education, and at the age of fifteen was apprenticed to a&nbsp;goldsmith in Edinburgh. Here he had some little opportunity for the practice of the humbler kinds of art, and&nbsp;various pieces of jewellery, mourning rings and the like,&nbsp;adorned with minute drawings on ivory by his hand, are&nbsp;still extant. Soon he took to the production of carefully finished miniatures ; and, meeting with success and&nbsp;patronage, he extended his practice to oil-painting, being&nbsp;all the while quite self-taught. The worthy goldsmith his&nbsp;master watched the progress of his pupil with interest,&nbsp;gave him every encouragement, and introduced him to&nbsp;David Martin, who had been the favourite assistant of&nbsp;Allan Ramsay junior, and was now the leading portrait-painter in Edinburgh. Raeburn received considerable&nbsp;assistance from Martin, and was especially aided by the&nbsp;loan of portraits to copy. Soon the young painter had&nbsp;gained sufficient skill to render it advisable that he&nbsp;should devote himself exclusively to art. When in his&nbsp;twenty-second year he was asked to paint the portrait&nbsp;of a young lady whom he had previously observed and&nbsp;admired when he was sketching from nature in the fields.&nbsp;She was the daughter of Peter Edgar of Bridgelands and&nbsp;widow of Count Leslie. The lady was speedily fascinated&nbsp;by the handsome and intellectual young artist, and in a&nbsp;month she became his wife, bringing him an ample fortune.&nbsp;After the approved fashion of artists of the time, it was&nbsp;resolved that Raeburn should visit Italy, and he accordingly started with his wife. In London he was kindly&nbsp;received by Sir Joshua Reynolds, who gave him excellent&nbsp;advice as to his study in Rome, especially recommending&nbsp;to his attention the works of Michelangelo. He also&nbsp;offered him more substantial pecuniary aid, which was&nbsp;declined as unneeded; but Raeburn carried with him&nbsp;to Italy many valuable introductions from the president&nbsp;of the Academy. In Rome he made the acquaintance&nbsp;of Gavin Hamilton, of Batoni, and of Byers. For the&nbsp;advice of the last-named he used to acknowledge himself&nbsp;greatly indebted, and particularly for the recommendation&nbsp;that “ he should never copy an object from memory, but,&nbsp;from the principal figure to the minutest accessory, have&nbsp;it placed before him.” After two years of study in Italy&nbsp;he returned to Edinburgh in 1787, where he began a most&nbsp;successful career as a portrait-painter. In that year he&nbsp;executed an admirable seated portrait of the second Lord&nbsp;President Dundas.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">Of his earlier portraiture we have interesting examples in the bust-likeness of Mrs Johnstone of Baldovie and in&nbsp;the three-quarter-length of Dr James Hutton, works which,&nbsp;if they are somewhat timid and tentative in handling and&nbsp;wanting in the trenchant brush-work and assured mastery&nbsp;of subsequent productions, are full of delicacy and character. The portraits of John Clerk, Lord Eldin, and of&nbsp;Principal Hill of St Andrews belong to a somewhat later&nbsp;period. Raeburn was fortunate in the time in which he&nbsp;practised portraiture.
