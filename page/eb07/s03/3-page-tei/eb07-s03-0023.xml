            <p>According to the present positions of the masts of a ship, the sails on the fore-mast
                are generally not capable of being so sharply braced as those on the main-mast ; but
                as theory and practice, as may be instanced in fore-and-aft rigged vessels, concur
                in fixing the limits to which it would be desirable to brace the yards, within even
                what can generally be attained on the main-mast, much of the force of the wind on
                the sails of the fore-mast must be lost ; and as this less sharpness of bracing,
                common for the yards on the fore-mast, is even found to be necessary in many ships,
                to enable them to carry their helm sufficiently a-weather, it would appear that the
                position of the fore-mast is too far forward, and that moving it aft would be
                advantageous ; besides the good effect it would have, as has been showm, in
                diminishing the violence of the pitching motion.</p>
            <p>The position of the fore-mast appears to have remained nearly the same as it was
                determined in the early part of the last century, although many of the reasons which
                then fixed it at about one ninth the length of the ship from the stem have ceased to
                exist. Our ships are now longer, and there is consequently room for working the
                sails, without those of one mast coming in contact with, or destroying the effect of
                the wind on, those of the other. The after-parts of the hull above water are very
                considerably reduced, and do not therefore render so great a proportion of head-sail
                necessary to counterbalance the effect of the wind on them. The bodies of the ships
                are, from the increase of the dimensions, much finer abaft, and consequently the
                resultant of the resistance is farther aft. From these considerations, and from the
                fact that it is found that complaints are made of ships carrying lee helms, it
                appears not improbable that the generality of our ships would be improved by an
                alteration in the position of their fore-masts.</p>
            <p>The forms of our ships, and indeed those of some of the more modern French vessels of
                which we are possessed, have approximated more to that recommended by Chapman, and
                since his time adopted by the Swedes and Danes, than to that of the old French
                bodies, which were for such a series of years the chief guides of the English
                ship-builder. The marked characteristics of the old French body were, a flat floor,
                with a sharp and, beneath the water, hollow fore-part, and a comparatively very full
                after-part. The character of the Swedish construction is, the rising floor, full
                fore-body, and extremely fine after-body. The generality of the English ships of the
                present day are built with the rising floor, and approximating more, towards the
                extremities, to the Swedish than to the old French characteristics. It seems
                therefore but reasonable that the positions of the masts of our ships should partake
                of the principle which appears to have dictated the alteration in the form of their
                bodies. With this view, and for a general example as to the positions of ships’
                masts, and of the ideas of various constructors, the following table has been
                formed, of the positions of the masts of the vessels contained in Chapman’s “ large
                work,” of some of the present Swedish ships, of the various classes of English
                ships, and of several other vessels which have either some peculiarity in this
                feature of their construction, or are remarkable for an excess of any good or bad
                quality dependent on it. The other data in the table are necessary for completing
                the comparisons which may be made.</p>
