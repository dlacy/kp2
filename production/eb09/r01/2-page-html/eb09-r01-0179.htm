<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">all; (2) an implicit belief in the power of magic, which accounts for the high veneration in which sorcerers and&nbsp;fetich-priests are held; (3) the predomination of fear over&nbsp;all other feelings, and the performance of religious acts&nbsp;mostly for selfish ends. For a somewhat more copious&nbsp;exposition of the character and the development of&nbsp;religions under the control of animism we must refer to&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Outlines of the History of Religion,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> §§ 7-17, and the works&nbsp;there cited.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Purified magical religions (</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">b)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> are the connecting link&nbsp;between the polydannonistic magic religions </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(a)</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and the&nbsp;anthropomorphic polytheistic </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c),</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> and ought to be distinguished from each. The gods, though sometimes represented in a human form, more frequently in that of an&nbsp;animal, are really spiritual beings, embodying themselves&nbsp;in all kinds of things, but principally in animals. Most&nbsp;images of the gods are either human bodies with heads of&nbsp;animals or the bodies of animals with human heads. It&nbsp;is therefore we call these religions therianthropic. The&nbsp;worship of animals is one of the principal characteristics&nbsp;of most of them. In a subsequent stage, though surviving&nbsp;sporadically, it is much more restricted. The same may&nbsp;be said of the widespread worship paid to the souls of the&nbsp;departed, which is one of the most important constituent&nbsp;elements of the religions in this stage of development,&nbsp;though it survives in the next stage as well. It is&nbsp;frequently combined, as, </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">e.g.,</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> in Egypt, with an elaborate&nbsp;eschatology. Magic and sorcery, though forbidden and even&nbsp;entailing prosecution if exercised by private sorcerers, are&nbsp;still held in high esteem when in the hands of the lawful&nbsp;priests. They are now organized as a traditional ritual&nbsp;and gradually developed into a boundless mysticism.&nbsp;Some of the ancient nature myths have already become&nbsp;legends and supposed primeval history. As might be&nbsp;expected, some of the religions belonging to the therianthropic stage stand nearer to the primitive animism,&nbsp;whilst others draw very nigh to the anthropomorphic&nbsp;stage; and so it would seem that we ought to make a.&nbsp;distinction between such therianthropic religions as belong&nbsp;to federations and such as belong to united empires—let&nbsp;us say, the unorganized and the organized. In the latter&nbsp;there is a strong tendency to monotheism and a kind of&nbsp;theocracy, the king being regarded as the living representative of the supreme deity, both of which characteristics are&nbsp;not so prominent in the former.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the anthropomorphic polytheism of the highest&nbsp;nature religions </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">(c) </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">there are, as in all subsequent stages,&nbsp;many survivals of what was common in the preceding,&nbsp;but so far as this could be done they have been adapted&nbsp;to the new system and disguised under new names or&nbsp;by means of new explanations. We call this polytheism&nbsp;anthropomorphic because the gods are now all of them&nbsp;superhuman but manlike beings, lords over the powers of&nbsp;nature and reigning over its departments, workers of good&nbsp;and of evil. As manlike beings they show more ethical&nbsp;tendencies and attributes than those of the previous&nbsp;periods. But, being indeed the old nature gods themselves,&nbsp;only remodelled and humanized, and their myths being&nbsp;originally fantastic and even animistic descriptions of&nbsp;natural phenomena, represented as wars and wooings,&nbsp;quarrels and revelries, robberies and tricks of the giant&nbsp;powers of nature, their mythology is full of disgusting&nbsp;narratives, and they are frequently represented as indulging&nbsp;the lowest passions and performing the most degrading&nbsp;acts. Pious poets and grave philosophers felt shocked by&nbsp;such myths, and either tried to mend them or boldly&nbsp;denied them; but they constituted nevertheless the faith&nbsp;of the majority till the fall of nature religion. Only,&nbsp;though essentially nature myths and still felt to be so, they&nbsp;are now no longer considered as an explanation of ever-returning phenomena, but, in accordance with the manlike&nbsp;character of the gods, as a kind of divine history, nay,&nbsp;are worked out into what may be called an imposing epic,&nbsp;beginning with the origin of life and ending only with&nbsp;the fall of the present cosmic economy. The gods themselves are no longer represented as animals or trees or&nbsp;stones; these have now become their symbols and attributes,&nbsp;and are only looked upon as being sacred to them. Of&nbsp;the power they possessed, in their old quality of spirits, to&nbsp;assume all shapes at will the myths of their metamorphoses&nbsp;still bear witness, myths now told by elegant poets for the&nbsp;amusement of their readers, but despised by serious philosophers. The real therianthropic beings of the old mythology, monsters like centaurs, harpies, fauns, satyrs, and&nbsp;others which could not be banished from ancient lore, now&nbsp;represent a lower order and are suffered to act only as&nbsp;followers or ministers or even as enemies of the gods.&nbsp;Not one of the religions in the polytheistic stage was able&nbsp;to elevate itself to the purely ethical standpoint; but, as&nbsp;moral consciousness went on increasing, deeper and more&nbsp;ethical religious ideas gathered round the persons of the&nbsp;most humane gods, the beloved son or daughter of the&nbsp;supreme deity, and gave rise to purer modes of worship&nbsp;which seemed to be forebodings of a time to come.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ethical Religions.</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">—1. With regard to the ethical religions the question has been mooted—and a rather puzzling&nbsp;question it is—What right have we to divide them into&nbsp;nomistic or nomothetic communities, founded on a law or&nbsp;Holy Scripture, and universal or world religions, which&nbsp;start from principles and maxims, the latter being only&nbsp;three—Buddhism, Christianity, and Mohammedanism ?&nbsp;The division has been adopted, among others by Prof.&nbsp;Kuenen, in his </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Ilibbert Lectures</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, though with the important restriction that Islam, as being essentially particularistic, ought to be excluded from the class of univer-salistic religions. In an interesting paper (in the Leyden&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">I'heol. Tijdschrift</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">, 1885, No. 1) Prof. Bauwenhoff rejects&nbsp;the whole class and particularly disapproves of the term&nbsp;“ world religions,” for which he substitutes that of&nbsp;“ world churches.” The question deserves to be discussed&nbsp;thoroughly, but for that this is not the place. Here we&nbsp;can only state the results to which a conscientious review&nbsp;of our own opinion and an impartial consideration of our&nbsp;opponents’ arguments have led us.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We now think that the term “ world religions ” must&nbsp;be sacrificed, though indeed “ world churches ” would do&nbsp;no better, perhaps even worse. Without serving longer to&nbsp;determine the character of certain religions, the term&nbsp;“ world religions ” might still be retained for practical use,&nbsp;to distinguish the three religions which have found their&nbsp;way to different races and peoples and all of which profess&nbsp;the intention to conquer the world, from such communities&nbsp;as are generally limited to a single race or nation, and,&nbsp;where they have extended farther, have done so only in&nbsp;the train of, and in connexion with, a superior civilization.&nbsp;Strictly speaking, there can be no more than one universal&nbsp;or world religion, and if one of the existing religions is so&nbsp;potentially it has not yet reached its goal. This is a&nbsp;matter of belief which lies beyond the limits of scientific&nbsp;classification.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still there is a real difference between two at least&nbsp;of the three above named, which are still contending with&nbsp;one another for supremacy over the nations of the globe,&nbsp;and the other religious communities which no longer try&nbsp;to make proselytes—between Buddhism and Christianity&nbsp;on the one hand, and Confucianism, Brahmanism, Jainism,&nbsp;Mazdaism, and Judaism on the other. And this difference,&nbsp;which ought to be maintained, is indeed one of principle,&nbsp;not of fact only. If the latter, after having been adopted&nbsp;by a nation, have remained stationary for centuries and</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
