<p><span class="font1">and nation. This you will apprize them of. Be aſſured alſo, that I wiſh you ſhould preſerye an affection to-wards your friend. If I am able to ſpeak to you no&nbsp;more, my picture will ſpeak to you for me ! (Signed)&nbsp;Stanislaus Augustus, King.”</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">This ſhows, at leaſt, the fate of the king ; and leaving that of the kingdom to be afcertained by time, we proceed to fulfil a promiſe which we made reſpe'ting another revolution, to which all the nations of Europe are&nbsp;ſtill looking with anxiety and alarm.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">when treating of France under a former article, we ſtated a few of the more ſtriking hiſtorical facts which&nbsp;led to the commencement of the revolution ; and we&nbsp;now come to trace the feries of tranſactions which have&nbsp;marked its terrible career. In doing this, we ſhall&nbsp;comprefs our ideas as much as poſſible ; and out of the&nbsp;endleſs variety of materials of which the public are in&nbsp;poffeffion, we ſhall endeavour to extract a ſhort and,&nbsp;if poſſible, a tolerably clear detail. For this purpoſe,&nbsp;however, it will be neceſſary that we begin, by ſtating&nbsp;the internal ſituation of France at the period immediately preceding the revolution, along with the more obvious political circumſtances which contributed to the&nbsp;production of that event. The moral hiſtory of man is&nbsp;always more important than the mere recital of any&nbsp;phyfical occurrences that may take place in his lot. It&nbsp;is not the fall of a mighty monarch and the diſperſion&nbsp;of his family ; it is not the convulſion of empires, and&nbsp;the oceans of human blood which have been ſhed, that&nbsp;render the French revolution peculiarly intereſting.&nbsp;Such events, however deplorable, are far from being&nbsp;without example in the hiſtory of mankind. In the&nbsp;populous regions of the eaſt, where ſuperſtition and&nbsp;ſlavery have always prevailed, they are regarded as form-jng a part of the ordinary courſe of human affairs ; be-caufe an intrepid and ſkilful uſurper finds it eaſy to intimidate or enſnare millions of weak and credulous men.&nbsp;In Europe the cafe is very different ; no adventurer&nbsp;can advance far without encountering thoufands as artful and as daring as himſelf. Events are not the refult&nbsp;either of blind hazard or of individual ſkill ; confpira-cies or plots produce little effect. Like other arts, the&nbsp;art of government has been brought to much perfection ;&nbsp;and an eſtabliſhed conſtitution can only be ſhaken by&nbsp;the ſtrong convulſion produced by national paſſions and&nbsp;efforts. The wonderful fpectacle which we are now to&nbsp;contemplate, is that of a mild and poliſhed people be-coming in an inſtant fa∙nguinary and fierce ; a well eſta-bliſhed government, celebrated for its dexterity and&nbsp;ſkill, overturned almqſt without a ſtruggle ; a whole&nbsp;nation apparently uniting to deſtroy every inſtitution&nbsp;which antiquity had hallo&gt;vcd or education taught&nbsp;them to reſpect ; a ſuperſtitious people treating the religion of their fathers with contempt ; a long enſlaved&nbsp;people, whoſe very chains had become dear to them,&nbsp;occupied in their public counſels in the diſcuffion of refined, and even viſionary fchemes of freedom : in ſhort,&nbsp;25,000,000 of perſons ſuddenly treading under foot&nbsp;every ſentiment and every prejudice that they themſelves&nbsp;had once regarded as ſacred and venerable.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Like the other nations of Europe, France was anciently governed by a barbarous ariſtocracy, whoſe different members were feebly united by the authority of </span><span class="font0">a </span><span class="font1">ſucceſſion of kings deſtitute of power or influence.&nbsp;The nobles, within their own territories, enjoyed privileges entirely royal : they made peace and war ; they&nbsp;coined money; they were judges i∏ the laſt reſort;&nbsp;their vaſſals were their ſlaves, whom they bought and&nbsp;fold along with the lands ; the inhabitants of cities, although freemen, were depreſſed and poor, depending&nbsp;for protection upon ſome tyrannical baron in their&nbsp;neighbourhood. At length, however, by the progreſs&nbsp;of the arts, the cities role into conſiderable importance,&nbsp;and their inhabitants, along with ſuch freemen of low&nbsp;rank as reſided in the conntry, were conſidered as enti-tled to a repreſentation in the ſtates-general of the kingdom, under the appellation of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">tiers etat,</span><span class="font1"> or </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">third efiaιe ;&nbsp;</span><span class="font1">the clergy and the nobles forming the two firſt eſtates.&nbsp;But the fovereign, having ſpeedily become deſpotic,&nbsp;the meetings of the ſtates general were laid aſide. Thia,&nbsp;abiolute authority, on the part of the crown, was not&nbsp;acquired, as it was in England by the houfe of Tudor,&nbsp;by abolifhing the pernicious privileges of the nobles and&nbsp;elevating the commons ; but by ſkilful encroachments,&nbsp;by daring exertions of prerogative, and the uſe of a&nbsp;powerful military force. In France, therefore, the mo-narch was abſolute, yet the nobles retained all their feudal privileges, and. the eccleſiaſtical hierarchy did the&nbsp;ſame. The following was, in a few words, the ſtate of&nbsp;that country during thefe two laſt centuries.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ί </span><span class="font1">he kingdom of France, previous to the. revolution, was never reduced to one homogenous mafs. It con-ſiſted of a variety of feparate provinces acquired by different means ; ſome by marriage, ſome by legacy&quot;, and&nbsp;others by conqueſt. Each province retained its ancient laws and privileges, whether political or civil, as&nbsp;expreſſed in their capitularies or conditions by which&nbsp;they were originally acquired. In one part oſ his do-minions the French monarch was a count, in another&nbsp;he was a duke, and in others he was a king ; the only&nbsp;bond which united his vaſt empire being the ſtrong military force by which it was overawed. Each province&nbsp;had its barriers ; and the intercourfe betwixt one province and another was often more reſtrained by local&nbsp;ufages than the intercourfe of either with a foreign&nbsp;country. Some ot the provinces, ſuch as Bretagne&nbsp;and Dauphiné, even retained the right of aſſembling&nbsp;periodically their provincial ſtates; but theſe formed no&nbsp;barrier againſt the power of the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The clergy formed the ſirſt eſtate of the kingdom </span><span class="font0">in </span><span class="font1">point of precedence. They amounted to 130,000,&nbsp;The higher orders of them enjoyed immenſe revenues ;&nbsp;but the rιzrct or great body of acting clergy ſeldom&nbsp;poffeffed more than about L. 28 Sterling a-year, and&nbsp;them </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">vicaires</span><span class="font1"> about half that ſum. A few of their dignified clergy were men of great piety, who reſided coa-ſtantly in their diocefes, and attended to the duties of&nbsp;their office ; but by far the greater number of them&nbsp;paſſed their lives at Paris and Verfailles, immerfed in all&nbsp;the intrigues and diſſipation of a gav and corrupted&nbsp;court and capital. They were almoſt excluſively ſe-lected from among the younger branches of the families&nbsp;of the moſt powerful nobility, and accounted it a kind&nbsp;of diſhonour to the order of biſhops for any perſon of&nbsp;low rank to be admitted into it. The lower clergy,&nbsp;on the contrary, were perſons of mean birth, and had&nbsp;little chance of preferment. At the ſame time, we find&nbsp;ſeveral refpectable exceptions to this laſt rule. The&nbsp;clergy, as a body, independent of the tithes, poſſeſſed a&nbsp;revenue ariiing from </span><span class="font0">their property in land, </span><span class="font1">amounting ∙</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
