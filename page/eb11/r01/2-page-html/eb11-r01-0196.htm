<p><span class="font0">Of the proceedings under </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">special commissions</span><span class="font0"> issuing from this court a descriptive catalogue (Elizabeth to Victoria) has been&nbsp;published in the 38th Report. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Depositions</span><span class="font0"> taken by commission&nbsp;(Elizabeth to George III.) are catalogued in the Reports 38-42.&nbsp;A catalogue of the later depositions exists in manuscript.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(2) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Lower Exchequer,</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exchequer of Receipt.</span><span class="font0">—The&nbsp;principal financial records of this department are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Receipt&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Issue Rolls</span><span class="font0"> showing the payments made to and by the Exchequer. The former consist of an exceptional roll for 14 John&nbsp;and a series from Henry III. to George III. The latter run from&nbsp;Henry III. to Edward IV. and from Elizabeth to George III. A&nbsp;translation of the issue rolls (2) for 44 Edward III. was published&nbsp;by F. Devon; who also published a volume of extracts from the&nbsp;issue rolls of the reign of James I., and another volume of extracts&nbsp;from the rolls for the period 41 Henry III. to 39 Henry VI. The&nbsp;other records of this department are very numerous.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(3) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exchequer of Pleas.</span><span class="font0">—The barons of the Exchequer without&nbsp;the lord treasurer had a court of their own, where process took place&nbsp;by common law. A list of the Plea Rolls of this court (20 Henry&nbsp;III. to 1855) will be found at p. 64 of the Record Office </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">List of Plea&nbsp;Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (No. 1V.). A partial index to the tithe-suits on these rolls&nbsp;is contained in the 2nd Report.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(4) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Exchequer of the Jews.</span><span class="font0">—Suits between Jews, or in which&nbsp;Jews were concerned, were tried before a special subordinate court.&nbsp;The Plea Rolls (3 Henry III. to 4 Edward I.) are listed in the Record&nbsp;Office </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">List of Plea Rolls.</span><span class="font0"> For specimens see </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Select Pleas, Starrs&nbsp;and Records of the Jewish Exchequer,</span><span class="font0"> edited for the Selden Society&nbsp;and the Jewish Historical Society of England by J. M. Rigg.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(5) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">First Fruits and Tenths.</span><span class="font0">—After the breach with Rome,&nbsp;the crown obtained a new source of revenue in the first fruits due&nbsp;to the pope from every holder of a benefice upon appointment,&nbsp;and from the tenths payable during his tenure of it. For a few&nbsp;years under Henry VIII. a special office administered this revenue.&nbsp;At the accession of Mary the business was transferred to a department of the Exchequer., The principal records are the following:&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Bishop's Certificates of Institutions to Benefices; Composition books&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">giving the names of incumbents and the sums paid by them in lieu&nbsp;of first fruits; and documents relating to the valuation of livings.&nbsp;The most important entries touching valuation were printed by&nbsp;John Ecton in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liber Decimarum</span><span class="font0"> (1711), which has passed through&nbsp;many editions under the titles of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Thesaurus Rerum Ecclesiasticarum&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liber Regis.</span><span class="font0"> The first fruits and tenths are now transferred to&nbsp;Queen Anne’s Bounty, and are managed by that office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(6) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Valor Ecclesiasticus.</span><span class="font0">—In 26 Henry VIII. a commission&nbsp;was issued for a valuation of all ecclesiastical property. The returns were made into the Exchequer and consist of eighteen volumes&nbsp;and three portfolios of rolls. Of these abstracts were made in three&nbsp;volumes known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liber Vαlοrum</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">King's Books,</span><span class="font0"> and a portion&nbsp;was copied in two volumes known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liber Regis.</span><span class="font0"> The original&nbsp;returns for the diocese of Ely, most of that of London and part&nbsp;of those of Salisbury, Lincoln, Durham and York are not now known&nbsp;to exist, and are very imperfectly represented by the abstracts&nbsp;and copies mentioned above. From these materials the Record&nbsp;Commission compiled six volumes folio known as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Valor&nbsp;Ecclesiasticus</span><span class="font0"> provided with maps and indexes. The introduction&nbsp;and general map were published later (1834) in a separate octavo&nbsp;volume; but some copies were struck off in folio and inserted into&nbsp;Vol. 1., which was published in 1810.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(7) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Court of Augmentations.</span><span class="font0">—This office was instituted&nbsp;to administer the property of the suppressed monasteries and the&nbsp;revenues of the duchy of Cornwall. The records consist of the&nbsp;muniments of the suppressed houses taken over with them and of&nbsp;documents connected with their actual seizure and subsequent&nbsp;administration (for the former, see </span><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Special Collections</span><span class="font0"> below;&nbsp;the latter are in great part calendared in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters and Papers&nbsp;relating to the Reign of Henry VIII.).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">There was also a judicial side of the office, in which the proceedings were by bill and answer. In 38 Henry VIII. this court absorbed&nbsp;an earlier one known as the Court of General Surveyors of the&nbsp;King’s Lands, which had been set up in 33 Henry VIII. A calendar&nbsp;of the decrees of the court will be found in the 3oth Report. The&nbsp;court of augmentations was merged in the Exchequer in ĭ Mary.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Chancery.</span><span class="font0">—The records of the chancery are here treated in two divisions, administrative and judicial.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">(1) </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chancery Administrative.</span><span class="font0">—These are either enrolments , of letters issued under the great seal, documents forming part of the&nbsp;process of issuing such letters, or documents drawn up for the&nbsp;information of the chancery.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Enrolments.—</span><span class="font0">The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Charter Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (1 John to 8 Henry VIII.) contain the enrolments of the most formal letters. The Record Commission&nbsp;published one volume folio containing a transcript of the rolls for&nbsp;the reign of John; and a badly designed and executed calendar&nbsp;entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Calendarium Rotulorum Chartarum.</span><span class="font0"> The Record Office&nbsp;has published three volumes of a complete calendar of the Charter&nbsp;Rolls from 11 Henry III. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Patent Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (3 John to the present&nbsp;day) contain enrolments of less formal letters addressed generally.&nbsp;The Record Commission published one volume folio containing&nbsp;a transcript of the rolls for the reign of John, with a valuable&nbsp;itinerary of that king. The Record Office has also printed in full</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">the rolls for the period 1-16 Henry III. From this point over 30 volumes of a Calendar have been published, and the remaining&nbsp;gaps in the series are being closed. For these gaps the Record&nbsp;Commission’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Calendarium Rotulorum Patentium</span><span class="font0"> is still useful,&nbsp;but only refers to a small proportion of the matter on the rolls.&nbsp;The rolls for the reign of Henry VIII. are calendared in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters&nbsp;and Papers of Henry VIII.</span><span class="font0"> The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Close Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (6 John to the present&nbsp;time) contain the enrolments of letters directed to specified persons&nbsp;and also enrolments of deeds made according to statute or for&nbsp;safe custody. The Record Commission published two volumes&nbsp;folio containing a transcript of the rolls for the period from 6 John&nbsp;to 11 Henry III. The Record Office has also published several&nbsp;volumes of rolls for the reign of Henry III. From the reign of&nbsp;Edward I. eighteen volumes of a calendar have appeared. The&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fine Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (1 John to 23 Charles I.) contain the record of judicial&nbsp;writs issued under the great seal with a note of the fine or fee paid ;&nbsp;also of letters of appointment to offices and letters relating to the&nbsp;administration of the feudal incidents of tenure. The Record&nbsp;Commission published a transcript of the rolls for the reign of John&nbsp;under the title </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rotuli de Oblatis et Finibus</span><span class="font0">; for the reign of Henry&nbsp;III. they also published two volumes of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Excerpta e Rotulis Finium&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">consisting of the entries relating to the feudal incidents. There&nbsp;were also other rolls containing letters issued under the great seal&nbsp;relating to special countries and subjects. The most important&nbsp;of these are here mentioned. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">French Rolls, Gascon Rolls,</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Norman&nbsp;Rolls</span><span class="font0"> deal with the affairs of the English dominions in France and&nbsp;with relations with that country. A catalogue of many of the entries&nbsp;on these rolls down to the reign of Edward IV. was published by&nbsp;Thomas Carte in two volumes folio. Of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">French Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (16 Edw.&nbsp;III. to 26 Charles II.) those for the reign of Henry V. are briefly&nbsp;calendared in the 44th Report; and those for the reign of Henry VI.&nbsp;in the 48th Report. Of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gascon Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (38 Henry III. to 7&nbsp;Edw. IV.) the earlier rolls have been printed in full in the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Documents&nbsp;inédits</span><span class="font0"> published by the French government under the care of&nbsp;MM. Francisque-Michel and Bémont. Of the broken series of&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Norman Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (1 John to 10 Henry V.) those for the reign of John&nbsp;and that for 5 Henry V. have been printed in full in one volume&nbsp;by the Record Commission ; to the remainder a calendar will be&nbsp;found in the 41st Report. The books here mentioned deal with&nbsp;some rolls now placed in other classes.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Other rolls contain letters under the great seal relating to Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Of these the Record Commission printed the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Scottish Rolls</span><span class="font0"> (19 Edward I. to 8 Henry VIII.) in full, omitting the&nbsp;numerous letters of protection contained in them. For the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Welsh&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Irish Rolls</span><span class="font0"> there is only a very partial calendar in Ayloffe’s&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Calendar of Ancient Charters.</span><span class="font0"> The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Roman</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Almain Rolls</span><span class="font0"> have&nbsp;been used in </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Fοedera,</span><span class="font0"> and many entries from the other chancery&nbsp;rolls will be found there. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Liberate Rolls (2</span><span class="font0"> John to 14 Henry&nbsp;VI.) contain the enrolments of writs for the issue of money out of&nbsp;the Exchequer. The rolls for 2-4 John have been printed in full&nbsp;by the Record Commission.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Documents forming Part of the Process of issuing Letters under the Great</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Seal.</span><span class="font0">—These are known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chancery warrants,</span><span class="font0"> and consist&nbsp;of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Privy Seals, Signed bills</span><span class="font0"> and other documents forming steps in&nbsp;the process. Series I. of these documents extends to the end of&nbsp;the reign of Richard III., and Series II. to the end of the reign of&nbsp;Henry VIII.; Series III. ends with the reign of Anne, and Series IV.&nbsp;with that of William IV., while Series V. is still in progress.&nbsp;Series I. and II. are arranged in chronological order (Series I.&nbsp;being also classified); the remainder are in monthly bundles.&nbsp;The warrants for the reign of Henry Vlĩĩ. are calendared in the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Letters and Papers of Henry VIII.</span><span class="font0"> ; those for the first seven years&nbsp;of Charles I. are calendared in the 43rd Report. With these may be&nbsp;placed the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitions ad quod damnum.</span><span class="font0"> Of these the Record&nbsp;Office has published a descriptive list (Nos. XVII. and XXII.) for&nbsp;the period 28 Henry III. to 2 Richard III.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Documents drawn up for the Information of the Chancery.</span><span class="font0">—The most important of these are the inquiries held under writs issued&nbsp;from the chancery. The first series of these (Henry III. to&nbsp;Richard III.) is now arranged in three classes, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitions Post&nbsp;Mortem</span><span class="font0"> including analogous documents relating to the feudal&nbsp;tenure of land, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Inquisitions</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Miscellaneous Inquisitions.</span><span class="font0"> The Record Office has published three volumes of&nbsp;a calendar of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitions Post Mortem.</span><span class="font0"> The Record Commission&nbsp;calendars refer to the old arrangements of these inquiries into&nbsp;two series, known as </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitions Post Mortem</span><span class="font0"> </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">&amp;c.</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitions&nbsp;ad quod damnum &amp;c.,</span><span class="font0"> a distinction of title which concealed the&nbsp;identity of the documents described. Both calendars contain&nbsp;many inaccuracies and omit much useful information. To supply&nbsp;some of these defects for the period Henry III. to Edward I. the&nbsp;Record Office published the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Calendarium Genealogicum,</span><span class="font0"> but this&nbsp;work does not attempt to deal with the lands mentioned in the&nbsp;inquiries. In the second series of these inquiries the three classes&nbsp;of inquisitions are all placed together. One volume of a calendar&nbsp;to the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Inquisitions Post Mortem</span><span class="font0"> for the reign of Henry VII. has&nbsp;appeared. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Certificates of Gilds</span><span class="font0"> are returns made under the statute&nbsp;of 12 Richard II. Those in English have been printed by J. and L.&nbsp;Toulmin Smith for the Early English Text Society. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Charitable&nbsp;Uses:</span><span class="font0"> a list (No. X.) of all inquisitions and decrees of commissioners</span></p>
