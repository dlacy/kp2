<p><span class="font1">breadth. Many pavements thus laid with stones of considerable breadth still remain, but experience proved that it was a mistake to suppose that broad stones having a larger base&nbsp;would support better the weight and shocks of heavy traffic;&nbsp;on the contrary, a wide stone has a tendency to rock on its&nbsp;bed, and also to wear round on the top and become slippery.&nbsp;To obtain an evener surface and a better foothold for the&nbsp;horses the stones were reduced in width, and in 1840 a granite&nbsp;pavement was laid by Walker on Blackfriars Bridge, which&nbsp;may be considered the first of modem set pavements. The&nbsp;stones were 3 in. broad and 9 deep; they were laid on a bed&nbsp;of concrete 1 ft. thick and were jointed with mortar. The&nbsp;reduction of breadth to about 3 in. was generally followed,&nbsp;but it was some time before a concrete foundation was&nbsp;employed to any great extent, the frequent breaking up to&nbsp;which streets are subject having prevented it. In London a&nbsp;foundation of broken Stonehas been continued in some thoroughfares, the sets being evenly bedded in gravel upon it and rammed&nbsp;with a heavy wooden rammer. Hard core—a mixture of broken&nbsp;stone, clinker, brick rubbish and old building materials—has&nbsp;also been largely used to form a foundation. In the northern&nbsp;towns of England cinders have been employed, and where the&nbsp;traffic is exceptionally heavy a pitched foundation of stories&nbsp;on edge has been laid when the sets were not paved upon an&nbsp;old macadamized surface. The concrete for a foundation to&nbsp;a paved street should be made with the best Portland cement,&nbsp;thoroughly mixed in proper proportions with the sand and&nbsp;gravel or other materials used, water being added as sparingly&nbsp;as possible. A thickness of 6 in. of well-made cement concrete&nbsp;is sufficient for the heaviest traffic, and it can be cut out in&nbsp;slabs for pipe-laying or repairs and can be relaid and cemented&nbsp;in its place. To obtain the best result a new foundation should&nbsp;not be paved upon for a week. A foundation of bituminous&nbsp;concrete is sometimes used where only a thin bed can be laid,&nbsp;in consequence of there being an old foundation which it is&nbsp;undesirable to disturb. It is made by pouring a composition&nbsp;of coal-tar, pitch and creasote oil while hot over broken stone&nbsp;levelled and rolled to the proper form, and then spreading a thin&nbsp;layer of smaller broken stone over the surface and rolling it in.&nbsp;It has the advantage that it can be paved upon a few hours&nbsp;after it has been laid.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The best materials for pavement sets are the hard igneous and metamorphic rocks, though millstone grit and other hard&nbsp;sedimentary rocks of the same nature are used when the traffic&nbsp;is comparatively light. Excessively hard stone which wears&nbsp;smooth and slippery is objectionable in spite of its durability.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Joints simply filled in with gravel are of course pervious to water, and a grout of Hme or cement does not make a permanently watertight joint, as it becomes disintegrated under&nbsp;the vibration of the traffic. Grouted joints, however, make a&nbsp;good pavement when there is a foundation of concrete or&nbsp;broken stone or hard core. Where there is not a regular&nbsp;foundation imperviousness in the joints is of great importance.&nbsp;In some of the Lancashire towns the joints have for many&nbsp;years past been made by first filhng them with clean gravel,&nbsp;well shaken in by ramming, and then pouring in a composition&nbsp;of coal-tar, pitch and creasote oil, which is allowed to percolate&nbsp;and fill up the interstices, the pavement being finished by&nbsp;covering it with small gravel. Joints so formed are impervious&nbsp;to wet and have a certain amount of elasticity; the foundation&nbsp;is kept dry; and the pavement with bituminous grout of this&nbsp;kind keeps its form well for many years. The objection is&nbsp;made that in hot weather the composition runs from the joints&nbsp;and makes the streets unpleasant for foot-passengers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">A pavement consisting of broad, smooth, well-jointed blocks of granite for the wheel tracks, and pitching between for the&nbsp;horse track, was laid by Walker in Commercial Road (London)&nbsp;for the heavy traffic to the West India Docks in 1825, and&nbsp;similar pavements have been successfully used elsewhere,&nbsp;principally for heavy traffic, in streets only wide enough for&nbsp;one vehicle. In Milan, Turin and other towns of northern&nbsp;Italy tramways </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">of </span><span class="font1">the same sort are extensively used for the&nbsp;ordinary street traffic. The tractive force required is small,&nbsp;while the foothold on the horse track is good; but the tram-stones are sllpperyfor horses to pass over. The rigidity of&nbsp;the roadway renders it more suitable for slow heavy traffic&nbsp;than for light quick vehicles, and the improvement in other&nbsp;pavements has limited the application of this one in ordinary&nbsp;streets.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Brick Paring.—</span><span class="font1">Since about 1885 brick as a paving for carriage-ways has been adopted to a considerable extent,&nbsp;chiefly in the form of shale bricks, in American cities. The&nbsp;clay is a hydrated siHcate of alumina, containing about 24%&nbsp;of alumina with 15% of iron, Hmc, soda, potash and magnesia.&nbsp;Limc is injurious, but alkaHs to the extent of 3% are needed&nbsp;to ensure a slight degree of vitrification. Various tests are&nbsp;used to determine their Hability to absorb moisture and to&nbsp;be abraded. That for abrasion is made by rolling half-bricks&nbsp;in an iron barrel or rattler in company with pieces of cast-iron for a given time, and noting the effect on the surfaces,&nbsp;but particularly on the angles, which should be tough enough&nbsp;to resist chipping. Comparisons are also made with test&nbsp;pieces of granite that are mixed with the bricks. To guard&nbsp;against chipping, the best-made bricks are pressed over again,&nbsp;and the upper angles rounded to a radius of three-eighths of&nbsp;an inch. Upon a foundation of concrete or well-rolled ballast&nbsp;a cushion or bed of coarse sand from half an inch to 3 in.&nbsp;thick is laid, and on this the bricks are set. They are&nbsp;then roUed till level, or are heavily rammed, a plank being&nbsp;interposed between the bricks and the rammer. No channel-courses are used. Pitch is poured in at the joints, but by no&nbsp;means on the surface, as that would make them slliperyBrick roadways have stood well under hard wear for fourteen&nbsp;years. Although in the United Kingdom bricks are produced&nbsp;unequalled for hardness and finish, no serious attempt has&nbsp;been made to introduce a tough brick for roadways that will&nbsp;neither chip nor wear smoothly. In various experiments with&nbsp;bricks that seemed most suitable they stood hard traffic for&nbsp;about a year. Clay of absolutely uniform character, and&nbsp;kilns that will ensure perfect equality in firing, are requisite.&nbsp;Slag bricks, made to interlock in the form of a double hexagon,&nbsp;the surface being grooved to a small pattern, have stood good&nbsp;tests for wear and foothold on a perfectly level surface. Many&nbsp;attempts have been made to use compositions, into which&nbsp;asphalt or cement usually enters, for making blocks or slabs,&nbsp;square or hexagonal, that can be laid down on a concrete&nbsp;foundation. A mosaic of macadam set in an iron frame is&nbsp;fixed by running molten slag into the back of the block. Small&nbsp;square pieces of oak are formed into blocks, end-grain upwards.&nbsp;Staffordshire blue bricks, made with holes to hold wooden&nbsp;plugs, have been used with some success. Broad blocks not&nbsp;firmly fixed down usuallybecome loose and tilt when subjected&nbsp;to traffic.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Asphalt Paring.—</span><span class="font1">Asphalt was first used for street paving in Paris in 1854. It was introduced in London in 1869, when&nbsp;Threadneedle Street was paved by the Val de Travers Asphalt&nbsp;Company, and since then it has been extensively used for&nbsp;paving both streets and footways. The material is a hard&nbsp;limestone impregnated with bitumen in the proportion of&nbsp;from 6 to 8% in the Scyssel rock, and from 10 to 12 in that&nbsp;from Val de Travers. Asphalts containing less than the former&nbsp;proportion have not sufficient coherence for street pavements,&nbsp;and those containing more than the latter proportion soften&nbsp;from heat in the summer. Asphalt is employed either as a&nbsp;mastic or compressed. The mastic is previously prepared in&nbsp;cakes and is melted for use in caldrons with a small quantity&nbsp;of bitumen, and for a street pavement is thoroughly mixed&nbsp;with sand or grit. It is spread in one thickness on a concrete&nbsp;foundation, covered with sand, and beaten to an even surface.&nbsp;This material has not proved so successful for street surfaces&nbsp;as compressed asphalt. To produce this, the rock asphalt,&nbsp;previously reduced to a fine powder by mechanical means,&nbsp;is heated in revolving ovens to from about 220° to 250° F.,&nbsp;spread while still hot, and compressed into a soHd mass by hot</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
