<p><span class="font0">See. The name of Octavian given by Alberic to his son leads to the inference that he meant to make his power hereditary.&nbsp;But, suddenly, he began to educate this son for the priesthood,&nbsp;and, assembling the nobles in St Peter’s shortly before his&nbsp;death, he made them swear to elect Octavian as pope on the&nbsp;decease of Agapetus IL They kept their word, for in this way&nbsp;they freed themselves from a ruler. Possibly Alberic trusted&nbsp;that both offices might be united, and that his son would be&nbsp;head of the state as well as the church. But the nobles knew&nbsp;this to be a delusion, especially in the case of a nature such as&nbsp;Octavian’s. The lad was sixteen years old when his father&nbsp;died, received princely honours until the death of Agapetus,&nbsp;and was then elected pope with the name of John XII. He&nbsp;had inherited the ungoverned passions of his grandmother&nbsp;Marozia and great-grandmother Theodora, but without their&nbsp;intelligence and cunning. His palace was the scene of the most&nbsp;scandalous licence, while his public acts were those of a baby&nbsp;tyrant. He conferred a bishopric on a child of ten, consecrated&nbsp;a deacon in a stable, invoked Venus and Jupiter in his games,&nbsp;and drank to the devil’s health. He desired to be both pope&nbsp;and prince, but utterly failed to be either. Before long,&nbsp;realizing the impossibility of holding in check Berengarius,&nbsp;who still ruled over the exarchate, he sought in 960 the aid of&nbsp;Otto I., and promised him the imperial crown. Thus the new&nbsp;ruler was summoned by the son of the man by whom he had&nbsp;been repulsed. Otto vowed to defend the church, to&nbsp;restore her territories, to refrain from usurping the&nbsp;power of the pope or the republic, and was crowned&nbsp;on the 2nd of February 962 with unheard-of pomp and display.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Accordingly, after being extinct for thirty-seven years, the empire was revived under different but no less difficult conditions. The politico-religious unity founded by Charlemagne&nbsp;had been dissolved, partly on account of the heterogeneous&nbsp;elements of which it was composed, and partly because, other&nbsp;nations were in course of formation. Now too the feudal&nbsp;system was converting the officers of the empire into independent princes, and the new spirit of communal liberty was&nbsp;giving freedom to the cities. Otto once more united the empire&nbsp;and the church, Italy and Germany, in order to combat these&nbsp;new foes. But the difficulties of the enterprise at once came&nbsp;to light. John XII., finding a master in the protector he had&nbsp;invoked, now joined the discontented nobles who were conspiring&nbsp;with Berengarius against the emperor. But the latter hastened&nbsp;to Rome in November 963, assembled the clergy, nobles and&nbsp;heads of the people, and made them take an oath never again&nbsp;to elect a pope without his consent and that of his son. He&nbsp;also convoked a synod presided over by himself in St Peter’s,&nbsp;which judged, condemned and deposed Pope John and elected</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Leo VIII. (863-65), a Roman noble, in his stead. All this was done at the direct bidding of the emperor, who thus deprived&nbsp;the Romans of their most valued privilege, the right of choosing&nbsp;their own pope. But the people had now risen to&nbsp;considerable importance, and, for the first time, we&nbsp;find it officially represented in the synod by the&nbsp;plebeian Pietro, surnamed Imperiola, together with&nbsp;tbe leaders of the militia, which had also become a&nbsp;popular institution since Alberic’s reign. It was no longer easy&nbsp;to keep the lower orders in subjection, and by their junction&nbsp;with the malcontent nobles they formed a very respectable&nbsp;force. On the 3rd of January 964 they sounded the battle-peal and attacked the Vatican, where the emperor was lodged.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The German knights repulsed them with much slaughter, and this bloodshed proved the beginning of an endless feud. Otto&nbsp;departed in February, and John XII., as the chosen pope of&nbsp;the Romans, returned with an army of followers and compelled the defenceless Leo VIII. to seek safety in flight. Soon&nbsp;afterwards Leo was deposed and excommunicated by a new&nbsp;synod, and many of his adherents were cruelly murdered.&nbsp;But on the 14th of May 964 John suddenly expired; the&nbsp;Romans, amid violent struggles and tumults, resumed their&nbsp;rights, elected Benedict V., and procured his consecration in&nbsp;spite of the emperor’s veto. Otto now appeared at the head&nbsp;of an army, committed fresh slaughter, besieged the city, reduced it by famine, and, after holding a council which deposed&nbsp;Benedict and sent him a prisoner to Hamburg, restored&nbsp;Leo VIII. to the papal throne.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But, although the emperor thus disposed of the papacy at his will, his arbitrary exercise of power roused a long and&nbsp;obstinate resistance, which had no slight effect upon&nbsp;the history of the commune. Leo VIII. died in 965,&nbsp;and the imperial party elected John XIII. (965-72).</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Upon this the nobles of the national party joined the people and there was a general revolt. The nobles were led&nbsp;by Pietro, prefect of Rome. As we have noted, this office&nbsp;seemed to be extinct during the Carolingian rule, but we&nbsp;again meet with it in 955, after an interval of a century and a&nbsp;half. The leaders of the people were twelve </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">decar coni,</span><span class="font0"> a term&nbsp;of unknown derivation, but probably indicating chiefs of the&nbsp;twelve regions </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(dodecarcki, dodecarconi, decar coni}.</span><span class="font0"> The new&nbsp;pope was seized and confined, first in the castle of St Angelo,&nbsp;then in a fortress in the Campagna. But the emperor quickly&nbsp;marched an army against Rome, and this sufficed to produce&nbsp;a reaction which recalled the pope (November 966), sent the&nbsp;prefect into exile, and put several of the rebellious nobles to&nbsp;death. And shortly after the emperor sacked the city. Many&nbsp;Romans were exiled, some tortured, others, including the twelve&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">decar coni)</span><span class="font0"> killed. John XIII. died in 972 and Otto in 973.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">All these events clearly prove how great a change had now taken place in the conditions of Rome. The people </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(plebs)&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">had made its appearance upon the stage; the army had become&nbsp;democratic; the twelve regions were regularly organized under&nbsp;leaders. Opposed to them stood the nobles, headed by the&nbsp;prefect, also a noble, precisely as in Florence the nobles and&nbsp;the podestà were later opposed to the gilds and the people.&nbsp;So far, it is true, nobles and people had made common cause&nbsp;in Rome; but this harmony was soon to be interrupted. The&nbsp;feudal spirit had made its way among the Roman aristocrats,&nbsp;had split them into two parties and diminished their strength.&nbsp;It was now destined to spread, and, as it was always vigorously&nbsp;detested and opposed by the people elsewhere in Italy, so the&nbsp;same consequence was inevitable in Rome. Another notable&nbsp;change, and a subject of unending controversy, had&nbsp;ako occurred in the administration of justice. So&nbsp;far there were the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices de clero</span><span class="font0">, also known as&nbsp;ordinary or palatine judges, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices de rnilitia^</span><span class="font0"> also&nbsp;ctyled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">consules</span><span class="font0"> or </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duces.</span><span class="font0"> These judges generally formed a&nbsp;court of seven, three being </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de clero,</span><span class="font0"> four </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">de militia, qt</span><span class="font0"> vice versa,&nbsp;under the presidency of the papal or imperial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">missl.</span><span class="font0"> In&nbsp;criminal cases the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices de militia</span><span class="font0"> had the prefect or the&nbsp;imperial </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">missus for</span><span class="font0"> their president. But there was a third&nbsp;order of judges called </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pedanei, a consulibus creati.</span><span class="font0"> It seems&nbsp;clear that the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duces,</span><span class="font0"> being </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">distribuii per judicat us,</span><span class="font0"> found themselves isolated in the provinces, and to obtain assistance nominated these </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pedand,</span><span class="font0"> who were legal experts. In Rome, with&nbsp;its courts of law, they were less needed, but possibly in those&nbsp;sections of the city where cases of minor importance were&nbsp;submitted to a single magistrate reference was made to the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pedanei.</span><span class="font0"> But many changes were made under the Franks,&nbsp;and when the edict of Lothair (824) granted free choice of&nbsp;either the Roman or Germanic law, and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">duces</span><span class="font0"> were replaced&nbsp;by </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">comites</span><span class="font0"> and </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">gastaldiones,</span><span class="font0"> chiefly of German origin, the use&nbsp;of legal experts became increasingly necessary. And the&nbsp;custom of employing them was the more easily diffused by&nbsp;being already common among the Franks, whose </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scabini</span><span class="font0"> were&nbsp;legal experts acting as judges, though not qualified to pass&nbsp;sentence. Thus the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">pedanei</span><span class="font0"> multiplied, came to resemble the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">scabini,</span><span class="font0"> and were designated </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices dativi (a magistratu dati}&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">or simply </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">dativi.</span><span class="font0"> These were to be found in the exarchate in&nbsp;838, but not in Rome until 961, when the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">judices de miliiia&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">had ceased to exist. The great progress of the German legal&nbsp;procedure may then have contributed to the formation of the&nbsp;new office.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Meanwhile Pope John XIII. had been succeeded by Benedict VI. (973-74) and Otto I. by his son Otto II., a youth</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
