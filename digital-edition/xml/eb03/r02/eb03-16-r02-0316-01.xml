<p><label>ROCKET</label>
an artificial fire-work, conſiſting of a cylindrical caſe of paper, filled with a compoſition of certain combuſtible ingredients ; which, being tied to a ſtick, mounts into the air, and then burſts. See Py-ROTECHNY.</p><p><hi rend="italic">Theory of the Flight of Sky-Rocκκτs.</hi> Mariotte takes the riſe of rockets to be owing to the impulſe or reſiſtance of the air againſt the ffame. Dr Delagulier accounts for it otherwiſe.</p><p>Conceive the rocket to have no vent at the choak, and to be ſet on fire in the conical bore ; the conſequence will be, either that the rocket would burſt in the weakeft place, or, if all its parts were equally ſtrong, and able to ſuſtain the impulſe of the flame, the rocket would burn out immoveable. Now, as the force of the flame is equable, ſuppoſe its action downwards, or that upwards, ſufficient to lift 40 pounds. As theſe forces are equal, but their directions contrary, they will deſtroy each other’s action.</p><p>Imagine then the rocket opened at the choak ; by this means the action of the flame downwards is taken away, and there remains a force equal to 40 pounds acting upwards, to carry up the rocket, and the ſtick it is tied to. Accordingly, we find that if the com-poſition of the rocket be very weak, ſo as not to give an impulſe greater than the weight of the rocket and ftick, it does not riſe at all ; or if the compoſition be flow, ſo that a ſmall part of it only kindles at firſt, the rocket will not riſe.</p><p>The ſtick ſerves to keep it perpendicular ; for if the τocket ſhould begin to ſtumble, moving round a point in the choak, as being the common centre of gravity of rocket and ſtick, there would be ſo much friction againſt tire air by the ſtick between the centre and the point, and the point would beat againſt the air with ſo much velocity, that the friction of the medium would reſtore it to its perpendicularity.</p><p>When the compoſition is burnt out, and the impulſe upwards is ceaſed, the common centre of gravity is</p><p>brought lower towards the middle of the ſtick ; by which means the velocity of the point of the ſtick is decreaſed, and that of the point of the rocket increaſed ; ſo that the whole will tumble down, with the rocket-end foremoſt.</p><p>All the while the rocket burns, the common centre of gravity is ſhifting and getting downwards, and ſtill the faſter and the lower as the ſtick is the lighter, ſo that it ſometimes begins to tumble before it be burnt out ; but when the ſtick is a little too heavy, the weight of the rocket bearing a leſs proportion to that of the ſtick, the common centre of gravity will not get ſo low but that the rocket will riſe ſtraight, though not ſo faſt.</p><p><hi rend="smallcaps">Rocket, in botany.
