<p><span class="font1">cannot wonder at finding </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">one</span><span class="font1"> man in thc world who had ſenſe enough to diſcern it, and virtue enough to oppoſe&nbsp;ſuch an infamous practice. In all probability, however,&nbsp;the inſignificancy of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">fiiſt </span><span class="font1">reformer was the reaſon&nbsp;why he was not perſecnted and exterminated at his firſt&nbsp;beginning, as others had been before him. Another&nbsp;reaſon probably might be, that he did not at once at-tack the whole errors of Popery, but brought about his&nbsp;reformation gradually, probably as it occurred to him-ſelf, and as we have related in the account of his life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The Reformation, began in the city of wittemberg in Saxony, but was not long confined either to that city or province. In 1520 the Franciſcan friars, who&nbsp;had the care of promulgating indulgences in Switzer-land, were oppofed by 'Zuinglius, a man not inferior in&nbsp;underſtanding and knowledge to Luther himfelf. He&nbsp;proceeded with the greateſt vigour, even at the very be-ginnſhg, to overturn the whole fabric of Popery ; but&nbsp;his opinions were declared erroneous by the univerſities&nbsp;of Cologne and Louvain. Notwithſtanding this, the&nbsp;magiſtrates of Zurich approved of his proceedings ; and&nbsp;that whole canton, together with thoſe of Bern, Baſil,&nbsp;and-Chaſſauſen, embraced his opinions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In Germany, Luther continued to make great ad-vances, without being in the leaſt intimidated by the eccleſiaſtical cenſures which were thundered againſt him&nbsp;from all quarters, he being continually protected by the&nbsp;German princes either from religious or political mo-tives, ſo that his adverſaries could not accompliſh his&nbsp;deſtruction as they had done that of others. The princes, who were upon bad terms with the court of Rome,&nbsp;took advantage of the ſucceſs of the new doctrines; and&nbsp;in their own dominions eaſily overturned a church which&nbsp;had loſt all the reſpect and veneration of the inferior&nbsp;ranks. The court of Rome had diſobliged ſome of the&nbsp;ſmaller princes in the north of Germany, whom the&nbsp;Pope probably thought too inſigniſicant to be worth&nbsp;the managing, and they univerſally eſtabliſhed the Reformation in their own dominions. Melancthon, Car-loſtadius, and other men of eminence, alſo greatly forwarded the work of Luther ; and in all probability the&nbsp;Popiſh hierarchy would have ſoon come to an end, in&nbsp;the northern parts of Europe at leaſt, had not the emperor Charles V. given a fevere check to the progrefs&nbsp;of reformation in Germany. In order to follow out the&nbsp;ſchemes dictated by his ambition, he thought it neceſſary to ingratiate himſelf with the pope ; and the moſt&nbsp;effectual method of doing this was by deſtroying Luther.&nbsp;The Pope’s legates inſiſted that Luther ought to be&nbsp;condemned by the diet of worms without either trial&nbsp;or hearing ; as being a moſt notorious, avowed, and incorrigible heretic. However, this appeared unjuſt to the&nbsp;members of the diet, and he was ſummoned to appear ;&nbsp;which he accordingly did without heſitation *. There&nbsp;is not the leaſt doubt that his appearance there had been&nbsp;his laſt in this world, had aot the aſtoniſhing reſpect&nbsp;that was paid him, and the crowds who came daily to&nbsp;ſee him, deterred his judges from delivering the church&nbsp;from the author of ſuch a peſtſlent hereſy ; which they&nbsp;were*ſtrongly ſolicited by the pope’s party to do. He&nbsp;was therefore permitted to depart with a ſafe conduct&nbsp;ſor a certain time ; after which he was in the ſtate of a&nbsp;profcribed criminal, to whom it was unlawful to perform&nbsp;any of the offices of humanity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">During the confinement of Luther in a caſtle near </span><span class="font1">warburg, the Reformation advanced rapidly 5 almoſt&nbsp;every city in Saxony embracing the Lutheran opinions.&nbsp;At this time an alteration in the eſtabliſhed forms of&nbsp;worſhip was firſt ventured uponatwktemberg,by aboliſh-ing the celebration of private maffes, and by giving the&nbsp;cup as well as the bread to the laity in the Lord’s flipper. In a ſhort time, however, the new opinions were&nbsp;condemned by the univeiſtty of Paris, and a refutation&nbsp;of them was attempted by Henry VIII. of England.&nbsp;But Luther was not to be thus intimidated. He pub-hihed his animadverfions on both with as much acrimony as if he had been refuting the meaneſt adverſary ;&nbsp;and a controverfy managed by ſuch illuſtrious antagoniſts drew a general attention, and the Reformers daily&nbsp;gained new converts both in France alld England.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">But while the efforts of Luthcr were thus everywhere crowned with ſuccefs, the diviſions began to prevail&nbsp;which have ſince fo much agitated the reformed church-es. The firſt diſpute was between Luther and Zuinglius concerning the manner in which the body and&nbsp;blood of Chriſt were preſent in the euchariſt. Luther&nbsp;and his followers, though they had rejected the notion of&nbsp;tranfubſtantiation, were nevertheleſs of opinion that the&nbsp;body and blood of Chriſt were really preſent in the&nbsp;Lord’s ſupper, in a way which they could not pretend to&nbsp;explain. Carloſtadt, who was Luther’s colleague, firſt ſuggeſted another view of the ſubject, which was afterwards&nbsp;confirmed and illuſtrated by Zuinglius, namely, that the&nbsp;body and blood of Chriſt were not really prefent in the&nbsp;euchariſt ; and that the bread and wine were no more&nbsp;than external fymbols to excite the remembrance of&nbsp;Chriſt’s fufferings in the minds of thoſe who received&nbsp;it. Both parties maintained their tenets with the utmoſt obſtinacy ; and, by their diviſions, firſt gave their&nbsp;adverſaries an argument againſt them, which to this day&nbsp;the Catholics urge with great force ; namely, that the&nbsp;Proteſtants are fo divided, that it is impoffible to know&nbsp;who is right or wrong ; and that there cannot be a&nbsp;ſtronger proof than theſe diviſions, that the whole doc-trine is falfe.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">To theſe inteſtſhe diviſions were added the horrors of a civil war, occaſioned by oppreffion on the one hand,&nbsp;and enthuſiaſm on the other. In 1525, a great number of ſeditious fanatics aroſe ©n a ſudden in different&nbsp;parts of Germany, took arms, united their forces, and&nbsp;made war againſt the empire, laying waſte the country&nbsp;with ſire and ſword, and committing everywhere the&nbsp;greateſt cruelties. The greateſt part of this furious mob&nbsp;was compofed of peaſants and vaſſals, who groaned under&nbsp;heavy burdens, and declared that they were no longer able&nbsp;to bear the deſpotic government of their chiefs ; and&nbsp;hence this ſedition had the name of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">the ruſlic war,</span><span class="font1"> or the&nbsp;</span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">war oſ the peaſants.</span><span class="font1"> At ſirſt this rabble declared, that&nbsp;they had no other motives than the redreſs of their&nbsp;grievances ; but no ſooner had the enthuſiaſſ Munzer,&nbsp;or Munſſer, the anabaptiſt, put himſelf at their head,&nbsp;than the face of things was entirely changed, and the&nbsp;civil commotions in Saxony and Thuringia exceedingly&nbsp;increaſed, of which an account is given under the article&nbsp;Anabaptists.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">In the mean time Frederic, ſurnamed the </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Wiſe,</span><span class="font1"> elector of Saxony, and Luther’s great patron, departed this life, and was ſueceeded by his brother John.
