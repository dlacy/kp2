        <p><span class="font0">of the Carpathians enter Volhynia, Podolia, and Bessarabia, that
                ridges reaching 1100 feet are met with, intersected by deep ravines.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The depressions on the borders of the central plateau thus acquire a
                greater importance than the small differences in its height. Such is the broad
                depression of the middle nVolga and lower Kama,&nbsp;bounded on the north by the
                faint swelling of the Uvaty, which is&nbsp;the watershed between the Arctic Ocean
                and the Volga basin.&nbsp;Another broad depression, from 250 to 500 feet above the
                sea, still&nbsp;filled by Lakes Peipus, Ladoga, Onega, Bieto-ozero, Latche,
                Vozhe,&nbsp;and many thousands of smaller ones, borders the central plateau
                on&nbsp;the north, and follows the same east-north-east direction. Only a&nbsp;few
                low swellings penetrate into it from the north-west, about Lake&nbsp;Onega, and
                reach 900 feet, while in the north-east it is enclosed by&nbsp;the high
                Timanskiyridge (1000 feet). A third depression of a similar&nbsp;character, occupied
                by the Pripet and the middle Dnieper, extends to&nbsp;the west of the central
                plateau of Russia, and penetrates into Poland.&nbsp;The immense lacustrine basin is
                now broken up into numberless&nbsp;ponds, lakes, and extensive marshes (see Minsk).
                It is bounded on&nbsp;the south by the broad plateaus spreading east of the
                Carpathians.&nbsp;South of 50° N. lat. the central plateau gently slopes towards
                the&nbsp;south, and we find there a fourth depression spreading west and
                east&nbsp;through Poltava and Kharkoff, but still reaching in its higher
                parts&nbsp;500 to 700 feet. It is separated from the Black Sea by a
                gentle&nbsp;swelling which may be traced from Kremenetz to the lower Don,&nbsp;and
                perhaps farther south-east. This low swelling includes the&nbsp;Donetz coal-measures
                and the middle granitic ridges which cause the&nbsp;rapids of the Dnieper. Finally a
                fifth immense depression, which&nbsp;descends below the level of the ocean, extends
                for more than 200&nbsp;miles to the north of the Caspian, comprising the lower Volga
                and&nbsp;the Ural and Emba rivers, and establishing a link between Russia&nbsp;and
                the Aral-Caspian region. The depression is continued farther&nbsp;north by plains
                below 300 feet which join the depression of the&nbsp;middle Volga, and extend as far
                as the mouth of the Oka.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The Ural Mountains present the aspect of a broad Swelling whose
                strata no longer exhibit the horizontality we see in Russia, and&nbsp;moreover are
                deeply cut into by rivers. It is connected in the&nbsp;west with broad plateaus
                joining those of central Russia, but its&nbsp;orographical relations to other
                upheavals must be more closely&nbsp;studied before they can be definitely pronounced
                on.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The rhomboidal peninsula of the Crimea, connected by only a narrow
                isthmus with the continent, is occupied by a dry plateau&nbsp;gently sloping north
                and east, and bordered in the south-east by&nbsp;the Yaita Mountains, the summits of
                which range between 4000&nbsp;and 5113 feet (see Crimea and Tavrida).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Owing to the orographical structure of the East-European plains,
                which Iiasjust been described, the river-system has attained a very&nbsp;high
                development. Taking their origin from a series of great&nbsp;lacustrine basins
                scattered over the surface of the plateaus and&nbsp;differing slightly in elevation,
                the Russian rivers describe immense curves before reaching the sea, and flow with a
                very gentle&nbsp;gradient, receiving numerous large tributaries, which collect
                their&nbsp;waters from vast areas. Thus the Volga, the Dnieper, and the&nbsp;Don
                attain respectively a length of 2110, 1330, and 1125 miles,&nbsp;and their basins
                cover 645,000, 244,600, and about 115,000 square&nbsp;miles respectively. Moreover
                the chief rivers of Russia—the Volga,&nbsp;the Diina, the Dnieper, and even the
                Lovat and the Oka—take&nbsp;their rise in the north-western part of the central
                plateau, so close&nbsp;to one another that they may be said to radiate from the
                same&nbsp;marshes. The sources of the Don are ramified among the tributaries of the
                Oka, while the upper tributaries of the Kama join&nbsp;those of the Dwina and
                Petchora. In consequence of this, the&nbsp;rivers of Russia have been from remote
                antiquity the true channels&nbsp;of trade and migration, and have contributed much
                more to the&nbsp;elaboration of the national unity than any political
                institutions.&nbsp;Boats could be conveyed over flat and easy portages, from one
                river-basin to another, and these portages were subsequently transformed&nbsp;with a
                relatively small amount of labour into navigable canals, and&nbsp;even at the
                present day these canals have more importance for the&nbsp;traffic of the country
                than most railways. By their means the plains&nbsp;of the central plateau—the very
                heart of Russia, whose natural&nbsp;outlet was the Caspian—were brought into
                water-communication&nbsp;with the Baltic, and the Volga basin connected with the
                Gulf of&nbsp;Finland. The White Sea has also been brought into connexion&nbsp;with
                the central Volga basin, while the sister-river of the Volga&nbsp;—the Kama—became
                the main artery of communication with&nbsp;Siberia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0"><sub>-</sub> It must be observed, however, that, though ranking
                before the rivers of western Europe in respect of length, the rivers of Russia
                are&nbsp;far behind as regards the amount of water discharged. They freeze&nbsp;in
                winter and dry up in summer, and most of them are navigable only&nbsp;during the
                spring-floods ; even the great Volga becomes so shallow&nbsp;during the hot season
                that only light boats can pass its shoals.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Russia has a very large number of lakes. The aggregate area of the
                largest ones is stated at 25,800 square miles.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">The following is a descriptive list of the principal rivers of
                European Russia.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">A. </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Artic Ocean
                Basin.—</span><span class="font0">(1) The Petchora (1025 miles) rises in
                the&nbsp;northern Urals, and enters the ocean by a large estuary at the Gulf&nbsp;of
                Petchora. Its basin, thinly peopled and available only for cattle-breeding and for
                hunting, is quite isolated from Russia by the&nbsp;Timan ridge. The river is
                navigable for 770 miles ; grain and&nbsp;a variety of goods conveyed from the upper
                Kama are floated&nbsp;down, while furs, fish, and other products of the sea are
                shipped,&nbsp;up the river to be transported to Tcherdyn on the Kama. (2)
                The&nbsp;Kara (139 miles) enters the Kara Sea. (3) The Mezen (510 miles)&nbsp;enters
                the Bay of Mezen ; it is navigable for 450 miles, and is&nbsp;the channel of a
                considerable export of timber. (4) The northern&nbsp;Dwina, or Dvina (950 miles),
                with a basin of about 150,000 square&nbsp;miles, is formed by the union of two great
                rivers, the Yug (270&nbsp;miles) and the Sukhona (330 miles). The Sukhona has its
                origin&nbsp;in Lake Kubenskoye, in north-west Vologda, and flows
                rapidly&nbsp;southwards and eastwards, having a great number of rapids. It
                is&nbsp;navigable throughout its length, and, as Lake Kubenskoye communicates by the
                Alexander of Wurtemberg Canal with Lake Bietoye,&nbsp;it is connected with the
                Caspian and Baltic. The Vytchegda (685&nbsp;miles), which flows west-south-west to
                join the Sukhona, through&nbsp;a woody region, thinly peopled, is navigable for 500
                miles and in&nbsp;its upper portion is connected by a canal with the upper
                Kama.&nbsp;The Dwina flows with a very slight gradient through a broad
                valley,&nbsp;receiving many tributaries, and reaches the White Sea at Archangel by a
                number of branches. Notwithstanding serious obstacles&nbsp;offered by shallows,
                corn, fish, salt, and timber are largely shipped&nbsp;to and from Archangel. (5) The
                Onega (245 miles) rises in Lake&nbsp;Latche in the south of OIonetz, and flows into
                Onega Bay ; it has&nbsp;rapids ; timber is floated down in spring, and fishing and
                some&nbsp;navigation are carried on in the lower portion.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">B. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">Baltic Basin.—</span><span class="font0">(6) The Neva (46
                miles) flows from Lake&nbsp;Ladoga into the Gulf of Finland (see Sτ Petersburg). (7)
                The&nbsp;Volkhoff (135 miles), discharging into Lake Ladoga (see Ladoga),&nbsp;and
                forming part of the Vyshnevolotsk system of canals, is an&nbsp;important channel for
                navigation ; it flows from Lake Ilmen (367&nbsp;square miles), which receives the
                Msta (250 miles), connected with&nbsp;the Volga, the Lovat (310 miles), and many
                smaller tributaries.&nbsp;(8) The Svir (135 miles), also discharging into Lake
                Ladoga, flows&nbsp;from Lake Onega (4925 square miles), and, being part of
                the&nbsp;Mariinsk canal system, is of great importance for navigation
                (see&nbsp;Volga). (9) The Narova (46 miles) flows out of Lake Peipus into&nbsp;the
                Gulf of Finland at Narva ; it has remarkable rapids, notwithstanding which an active
                navigation is carried on by means of its&nbsp;waters. Lake Peipus, or Tchudskoye
                (136 square miles), receives&nbsp;—(10) the Velikaya (210 miles), a channel of
                traffic with southern&nbsp;Russia from a remote antiquity, but now navigable only in
                its lower&nbsp;portion, and (11) the Embach (83 miles), navigated by steamers
                to&nbsp;Dorpat. (12) The Düna, or West Dwina (577 miles), with a basin&nbsp;area of
                about 75,000 square miles, rises in the Ostashkoff district&nbsp;of Tver, and falls
                into the sea below Riga, after having described a&nbsp;great curve to the south. It
                is shallow above the rapids of Jacob-stadt, but navigation is carried on as far as
                Vitebsk,—corn, timber&nbsp;for shipbuilding, potash, flax, &amp;c., being the
                principal shipments of&nbsp;its navigable tributaries (the Obsha, Ulla, and Kasplya)
                ; the Ulla&nbsp;is connected by the Berezina canals with the Dnieper. (13)
                The&nbsp;Niemen (Memel), with a course of 470 miles in Russia, rises in
                the&nbsp;north of Minsk, leaves Russia at Yurburg, and enters the Kurische&nbsp;Haff
                ; rafts are floated upon it almost from its sources, and steamers&nbsp;ply as far as
                to Kovno ; the export of corn and timber to Prussia,&nbsp;and import of fish,
                grocery, and manufactured ware are considerable ; it is connected by the Oginski
                Canal with the Dnieper. The&nbsp;chief tributaries are the Viliya and the Shara. For
                (14) the&nbsp;Vistula, with the Bug and Narew, see Poland.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">Black Sea Basin.—</span><span class="font0">(15) The
                Pruth (505 miles) rises in&nbsp;Austrian Bukovina, and separates Russia from
                Roumania; it&nbsp;enters (16) the Danube, which flows along the Russian frontier
                for&nbsp;100 miles below Reni, touching it with its Kiliabranch. (17)
                The&nbsp;Dniester (530 miles within Russia and about 330 miles in
                Austria)&nbsp;rises in Galicia. Light boats and rafts are floated at all
                points,&nbsp;and steamers ply on its lower portion ; its estuary has
                important&nbsp;fisheries. (18) The Dnieper (1330 miles), with a basin of
                about&nbsp;245,000 square miles, with tributaries, waters thirteen
                governments,&nbsp;of which the aggregate population numbers about 15,000,000.
                It&nbsp;also originates in the north-western parts of the central plateau,&nbsp;in
                the same marshy lakes which give rise to the Volga and&nbsp;Düna. It flows west,
                south, south-east, and south-west, and&nbsp;enters a bay in the north-western part
                of the Black Sea. In the&nbsp;middle navigable part of its course, from Dorogobuzh
                to Ekate-rinoslaff, it is an active channel for traffic. It receives
                several&nbsp;large tributaries :—on the right, the Berezina (285 miles), connected
                with the Diina, and the Pripet (400 miles), both most&nbsp;important for
                navigation,—as well as several smaller tributaries on&nbsp;which rafts are floated ;
                on the left the Sozh (330 miles), the&nbsp;Desna (590 miles), one of the most
                important rivers of Russia,&nbsp;navigated by steamers as far as Bryansk, the SuIa
                (252 miles),&nbsp;the PsioI (415 miles), and the VorskIa (268 miles).
                Below&nbsp;Ekaterinoslaff the Dnieper flows for 46 miles through a series
                of&nbsp;thirteen rapids. At Kherson it enters its long (40 miles)
