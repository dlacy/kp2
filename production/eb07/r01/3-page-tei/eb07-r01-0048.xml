The number of trips has also to be augmented by an average allowance for the above tonnage. For computing the expense of the way, we must likewise include the weight of the engines and tenders, say 15 tons each.

Both the weight and the velocity are evidently functions of the expenditure, taking the drawn weight in estimating the cost of the power and the passing weight for that of the way ; and as the cost of passengers and that of goods is not separated, which indeed could hardly be done for the way, we have no guide, and can only make an approximation, by taking the cost directly as the weight and velocity. We have then</p><p>For locomotive power</p><p>23324242-15 : 11516928.25 or 349863630 :287923200, or as 1∙215 to 1.</p><p>This gives us in money,</p><p>Goods..........'................L.37054.5</p><p>Passengers..................... 30497.5</p><p>ToUl..................L.67552</p><p>A similar result drawn from the number of trips only, would give for the goods, L.28710, and the passengers L.38842, which is clearly inadmissible ; unless we are prepared to say that the locomotive power is used in a most disadvantageous manner, of which we have no evidence. Hence, if we multiply the number of passengers by 0∙353585, or, which will be sufficiently accurate, by O-3536, it will give us the total weight drawn in trains, averaging as those did on the Liverpool and Manchester line at the time in question ; or, in other words, there are 2∙8282 passengers to a ton gross weight.</p><p>In order to apportion the expense of mainuining the way between the goods and passengers, we have,</p><p>For maintenance of the way,</p><p>3267577815: 19709470-25 or 490136670:492736750, or as 1 : 1∙005.</p><p>This gives us in money such a small difference from equal proportions, that we may safely venture to place halt the expense on each ; always premising, as we have before explained, that the workmanship in the waggon springs, wheels, and axles, is to be considered as of the best description, without which the expense may be almost anything.</p><p>The result deduced from the number of trips would have given us the goods’ expense to the passengers, nearly as 16 :22, an additional proof that this method is very erroneous. We are aware of the difficulties which envelope the whole question, especially in first working a railway, when the embankments settle down and render very expensive repairs necessary, without a single vehicle passing over the road, whilst the more it is used, the sooner it will get in perfect order. Nor are there any data to guide us correctly, as respects the effect of velocity ; but from an attentive consideration of the subject, combined with a comparison on many lines, we believe the foregoing method to be that which agrees best with practical results, and with this we must rest satisfied till more experimental knowledge is acquired.</p><p>For the locomotive power, the cost of new engines and repairs must now be separated from that of the working expenditure in coke, oil, grease, waste, w-ages, &amp;c.
