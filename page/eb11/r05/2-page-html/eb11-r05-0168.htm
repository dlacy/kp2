<p><span class="font0">anachronisms. The third is altogether poetical. The </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Poviest o Drakule</span><span class="font0"> (“ Story of Drakula ”) is a collection of anecdotes&nbsp;relating to a cruel prince of Walachia who lived in the 15th&nbsp;century. (See Rumania, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">History.)</span><span class="font0"> Several of the barbarities&nbsp;described in'it have also been assigned to Ivan the Terrible.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The early Russian laws present many features of interest, such as the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Russkaya Pravda</span><span class="font0"> of Yaroslav, which is preserved in the&nbsp;chronicle of Novgorod; the date is between 1018 and&nbsp;1054. The laws show Russia at that time to have&nbsp;been in civilization quite on a level with the rest&nbsp;of Europe. But the evil influence of the Mongols was&nbsp;soon to make itself felt. The next important code is&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Sudebnik</span><span class="font0"> of Ivan III., the date of which is 1497;&nbsp;this was followed by that of Ivan IV. of the year 155b, in&nbsp;which we have a republication by the tsar of his grandfather’s laws, with additions. In the time of this emperor&nbsp;also was issued the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stoglav</span><span class="font0"> (1551), a body of ecclesiastical&nbsp;regulations. Mention must also be made of the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ulozhenie</span><span class="font0"> or&nbsp;“ Ordinance ” of the tsar Alexis. This abounds with enactments of sanguinary punishment: women are buried alive&nbsp;for murdering their husbands; torture is recognized as a&nbsp;means of procuring evidence; and the knout and mutilation&nbsp;are mentioned on almost every page. Some of the penalties&nbsp;are whimsical: for instance, the man who uses tobacco is to&nbsp;have his nose cut off; this was altered by Peter the Great,</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">who himself practised the habit and encouraged it in others.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1553 a printing press was established at Moscow, and in 1564 the first book was printed, an “ Apostol,” as it&nbsp;is called, </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">i.e.</span><span class="font0"> a book containing the Acts of the Apostles&nbsp;and the Epistles. The printers were Ivan Feodorov&nbsp;and Peter Timofieiev; a monument has been erected&nbsp;to the memory of the former. As early as 1548 Ivan had&nbsp;invited printers to Russia, but they were detained on their&nbsp;journey. Feodorov and his companions were soon, however,&nbsp;compelled to leave Russia, and found a protector in Sigismund&nbsp;III. The cause appears to have been the enmity of the copyists&nbsp;of books, who succeeded in drawing over to their side the more&nbsp;fanatical priests. The first Slavonic Bible was printed at&nbsp;Ostrog in Volhynia in 1581. Another press, however, was&nbsp;soon established at Moscow; up to 1600 sixteen books had</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">been issued there.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">A curious work of the time of Ivan the Terrible is the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Domostroy,</span><span class="font0"> or “ Book of Household Management,” which is&nbsp;said to have been written by the monk Sylvester.&nbsp;This priest was at one time very influential with&nbsp;Ivan, but ultimately was banished to the Solovetskoy&nbsp;monastery on the White Sea. The work was originally intended&nbsp;by Sylvester for his son Anthemius and his daughter-in-law&nbsp;Pelagia, but it soon became very popular. We have a faithful&nbsp;picture of the Russia of the time, with all its barbarisms and&nbsp;ignorance. We see the unbounded authority of the husband&nbsp;in his own household: he may inflict personal chastisement&nbsp;upon his wife; and her chief duty lies in ministering to his&nbsp;wants. To the reign of Ivan the Terrible must also be assigned&nbsp;the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chetii-Minei</span><span class="font0"> or “ Book of Monthly Readings,” containing extracts from the Greek fathers, arranged for every&nbsp;day of the week. The work was compiled by the metropolitan&nbsp;Macarius, and was the labour of twelve years. An important&nbsp;writer of&quot; the same period was Prince Andrew Kurbskiy, descended from the sovereigns of Yaroslavl, who was born about&nbsp;1528. In his early days Kurbskiy saw a great deal of service,&nbsp;having fought at Kazan and in Livonia. But he quarrelled&nbsp;with Ivan, who had begun to persecute the followers of Sylvester&nbsp;and Adashev, and fled to Lithuania in 1563, where he was&nbsp;well received by Sigismund Augustus. From his retreat he&nbsp;commenced a correspondence with Ivan, in which he reproached&nbsp;him for his many cruelties. Ivan in his answer declared that he&nbsp;was quite justified in taking the lives of his slaves if he thought&nbsp;it right to do so. Kurbskiy died in exile in 1583. He also wrote&nbsp;a life of Ivan, but Bestuzhev Riumin thinks that his hatred&nbsp;of Ivan led him to exaggerate, and he regrets that Karamzin&nbsp;should have followed him so closely. Besides the answers of</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Ivan to Kurbskiy, there is his letter to Cosmas and the brotherhood of the Cyrillian monastery on the White Lake (Bielo Ozero), in which he reproaches them for the self-indulgent lives they&nbsp;are leading. Other works of the 16th century are the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Stepennaya&nbsp;Kniga,</span><span class="font0"> or “ Book of Degrees ” (or “ Pedigrees ”), in which historical events are grouped under the reigns of the grand-dukes,&nbsp;whose pedigrees are also given; and the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Life of the Tsar Feodor&nbsp;Ivanovich</span><span class="font0"> (1584-98), written by the patriarch Job.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the beginning of the 17th century belongs the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Chronograph of</span><span class="font0"> Sergius Kubasov of Tobolsk. His work extends from the&nbsp;creation of the world to the accession of Michael&nbsp;Romanov, and contains interesting accounts of such&nbsp;of the members of the Russian royal family as Kubasov&nbsp;had himself seen. Something of the same kind must have&nbsp;been the journal of Prince Mstislavskiy, which he showed the&nbsp;English ambassador Jerome Horsey, but which is now lost.@@<sup>1</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font0">To the time of the first Romanovs belongs the story of the siege of Azov, a prose poem, which tells us, in an inflated style,&nbsp;how in 1637 a body of Cossacks triumphantly repelled the&nbsp;attacks of the Turks. There is also an account of the siege of&nbsp;the Troitza monastery by the Poles during the “ Smutnoe&nbsp;Vremya,” or Period of Troubles, as it is called—that which&nbsp;deals with the adventures of the false Demetrius and the Polish&nbsp;invasion which followed. But all these are surpassed by the&nbsp;work on Russia of Gregory Karpov Kotoshikhin. He&nbsp;served in the ambassador’s office </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(posolskiy prikaz),&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">and when called upon to give information against&nbsp;his colleagues fled to Poland about 1664. Thence he passed&nbsp;into Sweden and wrote his . account of Russia under Alexis&nbsp;Mikhailovich at the request of Count Delagardie, the chancellor.&nbsp;He was executed in 1667 for slaying in a quarrel the master of&nbsp;the house in which he lived. The manuscript was found by&nbsp;Professor Soloviev of Helsingfors at Upsala and printed in 1840.&nbsp;The picture which Kotoshikhin draws of his native country&nbsp;is a sad one, and from his description, and the facts we gather&nbsp;from the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Domostroy,</span><span class="font0"> we can reconstruct the Old Russia of the&nbsp;time before Peter the Great. Perhaps, as an exile, Kotoshikhin&nbsp;allowed himself to write too bitterly. A curious work is the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Uriadnik Sokolnichia Puti</span><span class="font0"> (“ Directions for Falconry ”), which&nbsp;was written for the use of the emperor Alexis, who, like many&nbsp;Russians of old time, was much addicted to this pastime. The&nbsp;Serb, Yuri Krzhanich, who wrote in Russian, was the&nbsp;first pan-Slavist, anticipating Kollar by one hundred&nbsp;and fifty years or more. He wrote a critical Servian&nbsp;grammar (with comparison of the Russian, Polish, Croatian&nbsp;and White Russian), which was edited from the manuscripts by&nbsp;Bodianski in 1848. For his time he had a very good insight&nbsp;into Slavonic philology. His pan-Slavism, however, sometimes&nbsp;took a form by no means practical. He went so far as to maintain that a common Slavonic language might be made for all&nbsp;the peoples of that race—an impossible project which has been&nbsp;the dream of many enthusiasts. He was banished to Siberia,&nbsp;and finished his grammar at Tobolsk. He also wrote a work&nbsp;on the Russian empire in the middle of the 17th century, completed in 1676, which was edited by Beszonov in i860. The&nbsp;picture drawn, as in the corresponding production of Kotoshikhin, is a very gloomy one. To this period belongs the life&nbsp;of the patriarch Nikon by Shusherin. The struggles of Nikon&nbsp;with the tsar, and his emendations of the sacred books, which&nbsp;led to a great schism in Russia, are well known. They have&nbsp;been made familiar to Englishmen by the eloquent pages of&nbsp;the late Dean Stanley.@@<sup>2</sup> From this revision may be dated the&nbsp;rise of the Raskolniks (Dissenters) or Staro-obriadtsi&nbsp;(those who adhere to the old ritual).
