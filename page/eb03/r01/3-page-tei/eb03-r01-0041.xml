Returning from the univerſity, he fettled in the metropolis, and commenced printer, “ then eſteemed (ſays wood) a profeſſion fit tor any fcholar or ingenious man.” He married the filter of Sir Thomas More, with whom, we are told, he was very intimate, and whofe writings he ſtrenuouſly defended. From the title-page of one of his books, he appears to have lived in Cheapſide, at the ſign of the mermaid. He died in the year 1536 ; aud leſt two ſons, william and John : the ſirſt of whom became a judge in queen Mary’s reign, and the latter a juſkce of peace. This John Raſtall, the fubject of the preſent article, was a zealous Papiſt ; but Bale ſays, that he changed his religion before his death. He wrote, i. <hi rend="italic">Ratura naturata.</hi>  Pits calls it a copious <hi rend="italic">(prolixa)</hi>  and ingenious comedy, deſcribing Europe, A-lιa, and Africa j with cuts.

Take of the feeds of ſtavefacre or loufewort, powdered, more or leſs as the occaſion requires, one part ; of oat-meal, three parts ; mix them well, and make them up into a paſte with honey. Lay pieces of ſt in the holes, and on the places where mice and rats frequent ; and it will effectually kill or rid the place of thoſe kind of vermin by their eating thereof.</p><p>Some time ago, the ſociety for encouraging arts pro-pofed a premium of 50l. for a preparation capable of alluring or faſcinating rats ſo that they might be taken ahve. In conſequence of this, a great number of new’ traps, &amp;c. were invented ; and the following methods of alluring the rats to a certain place were publiſhed.</p><p>Θne of thoſe moſt eaſily and efficaciouſly practiſed is the trailing ſome pieces of their moſt favourite food, which ſhould be of the kind that has the ſtrongeſt ſcent, ſuch as toaſted cheeſe or broiled red herrings, from thc holes or entrances of the cloſet to their receſſes in every part of the houſe or contiguous building. At the extremities and in different parts of the courfe of this trailed track, ſmall quantities oſ meal, or any other kind, of their food, ſhould be laid, to bring the greater number into the tracks, and to encourage them to purſue it to the place where they are intended to be taken : at that place, when time admits oſ it, a more plentiful repail is laid for them, and the trailing repeated for two or three nights.</p><p>Beſides this trailing and way-baiting, fome of the moſt expert of the rat-catchers have a ſhorter and per-haps more effectual method of bringing them together; which is the calling them, by making ſuch a whiffling node as reſembles their own call ; and by this means, with the aſſiſtance of the way-baits, they call them out of their holes, and lead them to the repaſt prepared for them at the place deſigned for taking them. But this is much more difficult to be practiſed than the art of trailing ; for the learning the exact notes or cries of any kind oſ beaſts or birds, fo as to deceive them, is a peculiar talent which is ſeldom attained : though fome perfons have been known who could call tog-ether a great number of cats ; and there was a man in London who.could bring nightingales, when they were within hearing, about him, and even allure them to perch on his hand, lo as to be taken.</p><p>In practiſing either of thoſe methods, of trailing or calling, great caution muſt be uled by the operator to ſupprefs and prevent the fcent of his feet and body from being perceived ; which is done by overpowering that ſcent by others of a ſtronger nature. In order to this, the feet are to be covered with cloths rubbed over with afafiaetida, or other ſtrong-ſmelling fubſtances ; and even oil of rhodium is fometimes uſed for this purpoſe, but ſparingly, on account of fits dearneſs, .though it has a very alluring as well as diſguiling effect. If this caution of avoiding the ſcent of the operator’s feet, near the tιack, and in the place where the rats are propoſed to be collected, be not properly obſerved, it will very much obſtruct the ſucceſs of the attempt to take them ; for they are very ſhy of coming where the ſcent of human feet lies very freſh, as it intimates to their ſagaci-υus inſtinct the preſence of human creatures, whom they</p><lb/><lb/><lb/></body></text></TEI>
