<p><span class="font0">tem omnia, quæ ad cultum deorum pertinerent, diligenter retractarent, et tanquam relegerent, sunt dicti </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">religiosi</span><span class="font0"> ex&nbsp;relegendo.” The reason given by Servius for his derivation of the word is “ quod mentem religio religet.” If the&nbsp;Ciceronian etymology be the true one, the word </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">religion</span><span class="font0"> will&nbsp;denote the diligent study of whatever pertains to the worship of the gods ; but, according to the other derivation,&nbsp;which we are inclined to prefer, it denotes that obligation&nbsp;which we feel on our minds from the relation in which we&nbsp;stand to some superior power. In either case, the import&nbsp;of the word religion is different from that of theology, since&nbsp;the former signifies a number of practical duties, and the&nbsp;latter a system of speculative truths. Theology is therefore&nbsp;the foundation of religion, or the science from which it&nbsp;springs ; for no man can study what pertains to the worship&nbsp;of superior powers till he believe that such powers exist, or&nbsp;feel any obligation on his mind from a relation of which he&nbsp;knows nothing. The subject, in as far as it can be discussed with advantage in a work of this kind, will accordingly be resumed under the former head. (See Theology.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">RELIGIOUS is used Substantially for a person engaged by solemn vows to the monastic or conventual life ; or a&nbsp;person shut up in a monastery or convent to lead a life of&nbsp;devotion and austerity, under some rule or institution. The&nbsp;male religious are popularly called Monks and Friars; the&nbsp;female, Nuns and Canonesses.</span></p><h1><a name="caption1"></a><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">RELIGIOUS MISSIONS.</span></h1>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-variant:small-caps;">The present time, says Leibnitz, is the child of the past, and the mother of the filture. Yet though every generation derives not only its existence, but in some measure its&nbsp;lot and its fortunes, from the one that preceded it, it is often&nbsp;most influenced by circumstances which attracted least tlιe&nbsp;notice of its immediate predecessor. We are well aware of&nbsp;many of the changes which are taking place around us ;&nbsp;they are such as strike the most inattentive eye. There&nbsp;are others of equal potency, but which force themselves less&nbsp;on observation, and in which a portion only of the community are interested. Such are the religious missions now&nbsp;coming into operation, which are scattering the seeds of&nbsp;new institutions, and laying the foundation of future em</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">ires, and which will cause that which is now a waste and owling wilderness to rejoice and blossom as the rose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Protestant missions are so late in their origin and partial in their establishment, that, if we look merely to themselves,&nbsp;we have scarcely sufficient data for estimating their effects.&nbsp;Fortunately, in the history of the world we may trace the&nbsp;operation of similar causes, and be enabled to estimate upon&nbsp;a great scale, during a long lapse of time, the immense benefits which missions for the diffusion of religious opinions&nbsp;have produced.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">At first view it may appear like a paradox to assert that the civilization of the world is greatly owing to religious&nbsp;missions ; and yet no truth in remote antiquity is so well ascertained.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ancient forms of civilization with which we are best acquainted is that of Egypt and Greece in the west, and that&nbsp;of India in the east. The civilization of Egypt was eminently sacerdotal ; it spread with the colonies of the priesthood, and had its chief residence around the temples. The&nbsp;original inhabitants of Egypt long retained traces of their&nbsp;ancient barbarity ; and it was not till the system of life introduced by the sacred caste, and conformed to the religious institutions, was complete, that Egypt assumed that&nbsp;national character which so eminently distinguished it from&nbsp;the surrounding nations. Whether Meroe or Thebes was&nbsp;the original college of the priests, is of small consequence to&nbsp;the present purpose. From either, new sacred colonies issued out in continued succession and in widening circles,&nbsp;until not only Egypt, but the banks of the higher Nile, and&nbsp;the green islands of the sandy desert, had their temples and&nbsp;their oracles, their arts and their institutions.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But these institutions were not confined to Egypt. These religious colonies crossed over the sea to impart their rites&nbsp;to different lands ; and amongst others the priests of Sais,&nbsp;bringing with them the worship of the divine n<sup>τ</sup>isdom, laid&nbsp;the foundations of a temple to Neith, a name which was&nbsp;afterwards transposed into Athene. From this religious&nbsp;mission, then, Athens, “ the eye of Greece,” and the light&nbsp;of the world in secular wisdom, derived that lustre which&nbsp;length of years has rather increased than impaired.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Not dissimilar from the progress of the priesthood over Egypt was the advance of the Brahminical caste or tribe&nbsp;over India, except that the latter were attended by military&nbsp;companions, and made their way by force of arms as well&nbsp;as that of opinions. Wherever the country was rich and open&nbsp;enough, this well-organized priesthood introduced its temples&nbsp;and its creed, its philosophy and its regulations, institutions&nbsp;that were not indigenous to India, but which were spread&nbsp;over its plains by colonies and conquest ; whilst among the&nbsp;hills are found a race, unmixed with the foreign intruders,&nbsp;speaking a different language, and still following the simple&nbsp;rites of their rude forefathers. Still more widely the rejected offspring of the Brahmins, namely, the Buddhists, have&nbsp;spread as missionaries over the half of Asia, and penetrated&nbsp;alike the seclusion of China, the remoteness of Japan, and&nbsp;the pastoral solitudes of Central Asia.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">But these, it may be said, are the missionaries of a false religion. True ; but if so much good has accompanied so&nbsp;much evil and error, what may not be expected from the&nbsp;missionaries of a faith founded upon revelation, who proceed upon their enterprise in more favourable times and with&nbsp;greater resources ?</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">When the true religion was established in the Jewish nation, it appeared at first view to be stationary rather than&nbsp;progressive. The Jews had the advantage of a central position. They bordered upon the states which in early times&nbsp;did most for the advancement of knowledge, Egypt, Phoenicia, and afterwards the dominions of Assyria and Babylon ; but what facilities the Jewish people gained for spreading their opinions by their being central, was in a great&nbsp;measure lost by their being morally isolated.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Providence, however, unfolded means, independently of the exertion of the Jews, for spreading the knowledge&nbsp;of the divine unity. The other descendants of Abraham,&nbsp;who, as is seen by the book of Job, retained the true religion, obtained that lot amongst the nations which placed&nbsp;them in the direct route by which the early commerce of&nbsp;the world was carried on ; and their favourable position&nbsp;enabled them at once to promote knowledge and to diffuse&nbsp;religion. The two points to which their journeys were&nbsp;especially directed were Sheba and Saba, Arabia Felix,&nbsp;and that part of Africa which still retains in a portion of it&nbsp;the name of Azab. Extending along this line of intercourse,&nbsp;a portion of the Ishmaelites occupied Mecca, in the paucity&nbsp;of Arabian towns early named the Great, at once the mart&nbsp;of superstition and commerce ; and where the Ishmaelites&nbsp;united to the worship of the black stone their own religious&nbsp;opinions, a mixture which is observable down to the time&nbsp;of Mahommed, who endeavoured to separate the doctrine of&nbsp;the unity from idolatrous rites, but who, from the inveteracy of ancient habits, was still forced to retain some of the&nbsp;Pagan customs.</span></p><h2><span class="font1">We have a subsequent proof of the line of communica*</span></h2>
