<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">thing from Calvart, much more from Lodovico Caracci ; he studied with much zest after Albert Dürer ; he adopted&nbsp;the massive, sombre, and partly uncouth manner of&nbsp;Caravaggio. One day Annibale Caracci made the remark&nbsp;that a style might be formed reversing that of Caravaggio&nbsp;in such matters as the ponderous shadows and the gross&nbsp;common forms ; this observation germinated in Guido’s&nbsp;mind, and he endeavoured after some such style, aiming&nbsp;constantly at suavity. Towards 1602 he went to Rome&nbsp;with Albani, and Rome remained his headquarters for&nbsp;twenty years. Here, in the pontificate of Paul V.&nbsp;(Borghese), he was greatly noted and distinguished. In&nbsp;the garden-house of the Rospigliosi Palace he painted the&nbsp;vast fresco which is justly regarded as his masterpiece—&nbsp;Phoebus and the Hours preceded by Aurora. This exhibits&nbsp;his second manner, in which he had deviated far indeed&nbsp;from the promptings of Caravaggio. He founded now&nbsp;chiefly upon the antique, more especially the Niobe group&nbsp;and the Venus de’ Medici, modified by suggestions from&nbsp;Raphael, Correggio, Parmigiano, and Paul Veronese. Of&nbsp;this last painter, although on the whole he did not get&nbsp;much from him, Guido was a particular admirer ; he used&nbsp;to say that he would rather have been Paul Veronese than&nbsp;any other master—Paul was more nature than art. The&nbsp;Aurora is beyond doubt a work of pre-eminent beauty and&nbsp;attainment ; it is stamped with pleasurable dignity, and,&nbsp;without being effeminate, has a more uniform aim after&nbsp;graceful selectness than can readily be traced in previous&nbsp;painters, greatly superior though some of them had been&nbsp;in impulse and personal fervour of genius. The pontifical&nbsp;chapel of Montecavallo was assigned to Reni to paint ;&nbsp;but, being straitened in payments by the ministers, the&nbsp;artist made off to Bologna. He was fetched back by&nbsp;Paul V. with ceremonious éclat, and lodging, living, and&nbsp;equipage were supplied to him. At another time he&nbsp;migrated from Rome to Naples, having received a commission to paint the chapel of S. Gennaro. The notorious&nbsp;cabal of three painters resident in Naples—Corenzio,&nbsp;Caracciolo, and Ribera—offered, however, as stiff an&nbsp;opposition to Guido as to some other interlopers who&nbsp;preceded and succeeded him. They gave his servant a&nbsp;beating by the hands of two unknown bullies, and sent by&nbsp;him a message to his master to depart or prepare for&nbsp;death ; Guido waited for no second warning, and departed.&nbsp;He now returned to Rome ; but he finally left that city&nbsp;abruptly, in the pontificate of Urban VIII., in consequence&nbsp;of an offensive reprimand administered to him by Cardinal&nbsp;Spinola. He had received an advance of 400 scudi on&nbsp;account of an altarpiece for St Peter’s, but after some lapse&nbsp;of years had made no beginning with the work. A broad&nbsp;reminder from the cardinal put Reni on his mettle ; he returned the 400 scudi, quitted Rome within a few days, and&nbsp;steadily resisted all attempts at recall. He now resettled in&nbsp;Bologna. He had taught as well as painted in Rome, and&nbsp;he left pupils behind him ; but on the whole he did not&nbsp;stamp any great mark upon the Roman school of painting,&nbsp;apart from his own numerous works in the papal city.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">In Bologna Guido lived in great splendour, and established a celebrated school, numbering more than two hundred scholars. He himself drew in it, even down to&nbsp;his latest years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On first returning to this city, he</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">charged about ¿621 for a full-length figure (mere portraits are not here in question), half this sum for a half-length,&nbsp;and </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">£5</span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;"> for a head. These prices must be regarded as&nbsp;handsome, when we consider that Domenichino about the&nbsp;same time received only ¿610, 10s. for his very large and&nbsp;celebrated picture, the Last Communion of St Jerome.&nbsp;But Guido’s reputation was still on the increase, and in&nbsp;process of time he quintupled his prices. He now left&nbsp;Bologna hardly at all ; in one instance, however, he went</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">off to Ravenna, and, along with three pupils, he painted the chapel in the cathedral with his admired picture of&nbsp;the Israelites Gathering Manna. His shining prosperity&nbsp;was not to last till the end. Guido was dissipated,&nbsp;generously but indiscriminately profuse, and an inveterate&nbsp;gambler. The gambling propensity had been his from&nbsp;youth, but until he became elderly it did not noticeably&nbsp;damage his fortunes. It grew upon him, and in a couple&nbsp;of evenings he lost the enormous sum of 14,400 scudi.&nbsp;The vice told still more ruinously on his art than on his&nbsp;character. In his decline he sold his time at so much per&nbsp;hour to certain picture dealers; one of them, the Shylock&nbsp;of his craft, would stand by, watch in hand, and see him&nbsp;work. Half-heartedness, half-performance, blighted his&nbsp;product: self-repetition and mere mannerism, with affectation for sentiment and vapidity for beauty, became the&nbsp;art of Guido. Some of these trade-works, heads or halffigures, were turned out in three hours or even less. It is&nbsp;said that, tardily wise, Reni left off gambling for nearly&nbsp;two years; at last he relapsed, and his relapse was followed&nbsp;not long afterwards by his death, caused by malignant&nbsp;fever. This event took place in Bologna on 18th August&nbsp;1642 ; he died in debt, but was buried with great pomp&nbsp;in the church of S. Domenico.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Guido was personally modest, although he valued himself on his position in the art, and would tolerate no slight in that relation ;&nbsp;he was extremely upright, temperate in diet, nice in his person and&nbsp;his dress. He was fond of stately houses, but could feel also the&nbsp;charm of solitude. In his temper there was a large amount of&nbsp;suspiciousness; and the jealousy which his abilities and his&nbsp;successes excited, now from the Caracci, now from Albani, now from&nbsp;the monopolizing league of Neapolitan painters, may naturally&nbsp;have kept this feeling in active exercise. Of his numerous scholars,&nbsp;Simone Contarini, named II Pesarese, counts as the most distinguished ; he painted an admirable head of Reni, now in the&nbsp;Bolognese Gallery. The portrait in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence is&nbsp;from Reni’s own hand. Two other good scholars were Giacomo&nbsp;Semenza and Francesco Gessi.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">The character of Guido’s art is so well known as hardly to call for detailed analysis, beyond what we have already intimated. His&nbsp;most characteristic style exhibits a prepense ideal, of form rather&nbsp;than character, with a slight mode of handling, and silvery, somewhat cold, colour. In working from the nude he aimed at perfection of form, especially marked in the hands and feet. But he was&nbsp;far from always going to choice nature for his model; he transmuted </span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">ad libitum,</span><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;"> and painted, it is averred, a Magdalene of&nbsp;demonstrative charms from a vulgar-looking colour-grinder. His&nbsp;best works have beauty, great amenity, artistic feeling, and high&nbsp;accomplishment of manner, all alloyed by a certain core of commonplace ; in the worst pictures the commonplace swamps everything,&nbsp;and Guido has flooded European galleries with trashy and empty&nbsp;pretentiousness, all the more noxious in that its apparent grace of&nbsp;sentiment and form misleads the unwary into approval, and the&nbsp;dilettante dabbler into cheap raptures. Both in Rome and where-ever else he worked he introduced increased softness of style, which&nbsp;was then designated as the modern method. His pictures are&nbsp;mostly Scriptural or mythologic in subject, and between two and&nbsp;three hundred of them are to be found in various European&nbsp;collections—more than a hundred of these containing life-sized&nbsp;figures. The portraits which he executed are few,—those of Sixtus&nbsp;V., Cardinal Spada, and the so-called Beatrice Cenci being among&nbsp;the most noticeable. The identity of the last-named portrait is&nbsp;very dubious ; it certainly cannot have been painted direct from&nbsp;Beatrice, who had been executed in Rome before Guido ever resided&nbsp;there. Many etchings are attributed to him—some from his own&nbsp;works, and some after other masters ; they are spirited, but rather&nbsp;negligent.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-weight:bold;">Of other works not already noticed, the following should be named :—in Rome (the Vatican), the Crucifixion of St Peter, an&nbsp;example of the painter’s earlier manner ; in Forli, the Conception;&nbsp;in Bologna, the Alms of St Roch (early), the Massacre of the&nbsp;Innocents, and the Pieta, or Lament over the Body of Christ (in the&nbsp;church of the Mendicanti), which is by many regarded as Guido’s&nbsp;prime executive work ; in the Dresden Gallery, an Ecce Homo ;&nbsp;in Milan (Brera Gallery), Saints Peter and Paul; in Genoa (church&nbsp;of S. Ambrogio), the Assumption of the Virgin ; in the Berlin&nbsp;Gallery, St Paul the Hermit and St Anthony in the Wilderness.&nbsp;The celebrated picture of Fortune (in the Capitol) is one of Reni’s&nbsp;finest treatments of female form ; as a specimen of male form, the&nbsp;Samson Drinking from the Jawbone of an Ass (Turin Gallery)&nbsp;might be named beside it. One of his latest works of mark is the</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
