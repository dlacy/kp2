<p><span class="font0">But on no </span><span class="font1">occafion has </span><span class="font0">the </span><span class="font1">mild </span><span class="font0">influence </span><span class="font1">of Chriſti-anity been more eminently diſplayed, or more happily exerted, than in ſoftening· and humanizing the barbarians who overturned the Roman empire. The idolatrous religion which prevailed among thoſe tribes before&nbsp;their converfion to Chriſtianity, inſtead </span><span class="font0">of </span><span class="font1">diſpoſing&nbsp;them to cultivate humanity and mildneſs of manners,&nbsp;contributed ſtrongly to render them fierce and blood-thirſty, and eager to diſtinguiſh themſelves by deeds of&nbsp;ſavage valour. But no ſooner had they fettled in the&nbsp;dominions of Rome, and embraced the principles of&nbsp;Chriſtianity, than they became a mild and generous&nbsp;people.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">we are informed by Moſheim, who was at pains to collect his materials from the moſt authentic ſources,&nbsp;that in the loth century Chriſtian princes exerted themſelves in the converfion of nations whoſe ſierceneſs they&nbsp;had experienced, in order to ſoſten and render them&nbsp;more gentle. The mutual humanity with which nations at war treat each other in modern times, is certainly owing, in a great meaſure, to the influence of&nbsp;the mild precepts of the Goſpel. It is a fact worthy&nbsp;of notice too, that during the barbarous ages, the ſpiritual courts of juſtice were more rational and impartial in their deciſions than civil tribunals.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">How many criminal practices which prevailed among heathen nations have been aboliſhed by their converſion to Chriſtianity ! Chriſtians of all nations have been&nbsp;obſerved to retain the virtues and reject the vicious&nbsp;practices of their reſpective countries. In Parthia,&nbsp;where polygamy prevailed, they are not polygamiſts ;&nbsp;in Perſia, the Chriſtian father does not marry his own&nbsp;daughter. By the laws of Zoroaſter the Perſtans committed inceſt until they embraced the Goſpel ; after which&nbsp;period they abſtained from that crime, and obſerved the&nbsp;duties of chaſtity and temperance, as enjoined by its&nbsp;precepts. Even the poliſhed and enlightened Romans&nbsp;were cruel and blood-thirſty before the propagation of&nbsp;the Goſpel. The breaking of a glaſs, or iome inch&nbsp;trifling offence, was ſuſſicient to provoke vidius Pυllio&nbsp;to caſt his ∩aves into ſiſh-ponds to be devoured by lampreys. The effuſion of human blood was their favourite entertainment ; they delighted to ſee men combating with beaſts, or with one another ; and we are informed on reſpectable authority, that no wars ever made&nbsp;ſucſh havock on mankind as the fights of gladiators,&nbsp;which ſometimes deprived Europe of 20,000 lives in one&nbsp;month. Not the humanity oſ Titus, nor the wiſdom&nbsp;and virtue of Trajan, could abohſh the barbarous fpectacle. However humane and wiſe in other inftances,&nbsp;in this practice thoſe princes complied with the cuſtom&nbsp;oſ their country, and exhibited ſplendid ſhows of gladiators, in which the combatants were matched by pairs ;&nbsp;who, though they had never injured nor offended each&nbsp;Other, yet were obliged to maim and murder one another&nbsp;in cold blood. Chriſtian divines ſoon exerciſed their&nbsp;pens againſt theſe horrid practices; the Chriſtian emperor Conſtantine reſtrained them by edicts, and Ho-norius finally aboliſhed them. It would be tedious to&nbsp;proceed through an enumeration of particulars ; but&nbsp;wherever Chriſtianity has been propagated, it has conſtantly operated to the civilization oſ the manners of&nbsp;mankind, and to the abolition of abſurd and criminal&nbsp;practices. The Iriſh, the Scotch, and all the ancient&nbsp;inhabitants of the Britiſh iſles, were, notwithſtanding</span></p></div><br clear="all"/>
<p><span class="font1">their intercourfe with the Romans, rude barbarians, till ſuch time as they were converted to Chriſtianity. The&nbsp;inhuman practice of expofing infants, which once pre-vailed ſo generally over the world, and ſtill prevails a-mong ſome Pagan nations, even under very humane and&nbsp;enlightened legiſlatures, yielded to the influence of Chriſtianity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Let us likewiſe remember, in honour of Chriſtianity, that it has contributed eminently to the diffuiion of&nbsp;knowledge, the preſervation and the advancement of&nbsp;learning. AVhen the barbarians overſpread Europe,&nbsp;wſhat muſt have become of the precious remains of poliſhed, enlightened antiquity, had there been no other&nbsp;depoſttaries to preſerve them but the heathen prieſts ?&nbsp;we allow that even the Romiſh clergy during the dark&nbsp;ages did not ſtudy the celebrated models of ancient&nbsp;times with much advantage themſelves, and did not&nbsp;labour with much aſſiduity to make the laity acquainted with them. It muſt even be acknowledged, that&nbsp;they did not always preſerve thoſe monuments of genius with ſuſſicient care, as they were often ignorant&nbsp;of their real value. Yet, after all, it will be granted,&nbsp;it cannot be denied, that had it not been ſor the clergy&nbsp;of the Chriſtian church, the lamp of learning would, in&nbsp;all probability, have been entirely extinguiſhed, during&nbsp;that night of ignorance and barbarity in which all Europe were buried for a long ſeries of centuries, after&nbsp;the irruption of the barbarians into the Roman em</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">Such is the excellence of the Chriſtian ſyſtem, and ſuch its tendency to meliorate the human character,&nbsp;that its beneficial influence lias not been confined to&nbsp;thoſe who have received its doctrines and precepts, and&nbsp;have profeffed themſelves Chriſtians; it has even produced many happy effects on the circumſtances and the&nbsp;characters oſ Pagans and infidels, who have had opportunities of beholding the virtues of Chriſtians, and&nbsp;learning the excellence of the morality of the goſpel.&nbsp;Thoſe virtues which diſtinguifiied the character of the&nbsp;apoſtate Julian were ſurely owing in no inconfiderable&nbsp;degree to his acquaintance with Chriſtianity ; and it is&nbsp;an undeniable fact, that after the propagation of&nbsp;Chriſtianity through the Roman empire, even while&nbsp;the purity of that holy religion was gradually debaſed,&nbsp;the manners of thoſe Pagans who remained unconverted&nbsp;became more pure, and their religious doctrines and&nbsp;worſhip leſs immoral and abſurd.— We might here adduce a tedious ſeries of facts to the ſame purpoſe.&nbsp;whenever Chriſtians have had any intercourfe with&nbsp;Pagan idolaters, and have not concealed the laws of&nbsp;the goſpel, nor ſhown by their conduct that they diſ-regarded them, even thoſe who have not been converted to Chriſtianity have, however, been improved in&nbsp;their diſpoſitions and manners by its influence. The&nbsp;emperor, whoſe virtues we have mentioned as arifing, in&nbsp;a certain degree, from his acquaintance with Chriſtianity, in a letter to an Heathen pontiff, deſires him to&nbsp;turn his eyes to the means by which the ſuperſtition of&nbsp;Chriſtians was propagated: bykindneſs to ſtrangers, by&nbsp;ſanctity of life, and by the attention which they paid to&nbsp;the burial of the dead. He recommends an imitation&nbsp;of their virtues, exhorts him to canſe the prieſts of Galatia to be attentive to the worſhip of their gods, and&nbsp;authoriſes him to ſtrip them of the ſacerdotal function,&nbsp;unleſs they obliged their wives, children, and ſervants,</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
