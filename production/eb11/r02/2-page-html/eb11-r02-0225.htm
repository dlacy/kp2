<p><span class="font1">legislative council consisting of the administrator, who presides, seven nominees of the company approved by the secretary of&nbsp;state, and 'seven members elected by registered voters (the&nbsp;number of registered voters in 1908 was 5291). In 1907 it was&nbsp;agreed to reduce the company’s nominees by one, so that the&nbsp;elected members should form the majority of the council. The&nbsp;secretary of state appoints a resident commissioner, who sits on&nbsp;both executive and legislative councils without vote. The duty&nbsp;of the resident commissioner is to report to the high commissioner&nbsp;upon all matters of importance. Ordinances passed by the&nbsp;legislative council are submitted to the high commissioner for&nbsp;consent or otherwise, but may be disallowed by the secretary&nbsp;of state.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">For the administration of justice there is a High Court with two judges having civil and criminal jurisdiction. There&nbsp;are seven magistrates’ courts throughout the territory. For&nbsp;the administration of native affairs there are appointed a&nbsp;secretary for native affairs, two chief native commissioners,&nbsp;twenty-eight native commissioners and six assistant native&nbsp;commissioners. Natives suffer no disabilities or restrictions&nbsp;which do not equally apply to Europeans except in respect of&nbsp;the supply of arms, ammunition and liquor. Native commissioners may exercise jurisdiction in native affairs not exceeding that exercisable by magistrates. The company has&nbsp;to provide land, usually termed Native Reserves, sufficient&nbsp;and suitable for occupation by natives and for their agricultural and industrial requirements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Revenue.—</span><span class="font2">The administrative revenue of Southern Rhodesia was at first much less than the cost of administration. The figures&nbsp;for 1899-1900 were: revenue, £325,000; expenditure, £702,000.&nbsp;Since that date revenue has increased and expenditure decreased,&nbsp;and from 1905-6 (in which year the revenue exceeded £500,000)&nbsp;the cost of administration has been met out of revenue. For&nbsp;1909-10 the revenue was approximately £600,000, the two main&nbsp;items being customs duty, £190,000, and native tax, £200,000.&nbsp;The native tax is £1 per head for every adult male and 10s. for every&nbsp;wife after the first.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Education.—</span><span class="font2">Besides a few private schools, there -were in 1909 34 schools for Europeans, 26 of which were wholly financed by&nbsp;government, the remainder being aided. The aided schools are&nbsp;as a rule connected with some religious body, and aid is given to&nbsp;the extent of half the salaries of the teachers and half the cost of&nbsp;school requisites. Loans are also given to assist in school building.&nbsp;A system of boarding grants has been instituted to enable children&nbsp;in the outlying districts to attend school. Education is not free&nbsp;except for poor children, but the fees in government schools do&nbsp;not exceed £6 a year. In 1910 several schools had reached the stage&nbsp;of preparing pupils for matriculation at the Cape University and&nbsp;similar examinations. The number of pupils in 1^09 in European&nbsp;schools was 1212, being more than double what it had been four&nbsp;years previously. The education of natives is in the hands of&nbsp;various religious bodies, but financial aid is given by government&nbsp;to native schools which comply with certain easy conditions. In&nbsp;1909, 80 native schools with an enrolment of 7622 pupils earned&nbsp;grants.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Military Forces.—</span><span class="font2">The military force in Southern Rhodesia is styled the British South African Police, and numbers about 40 officers,&nbsp;400 non-commissioned officers and men, and 550 native policé.&nbsp;The force is under a commandant-general, who, with the sub-ordinaté officers, is appointed by the secretary of state, and is&nbsp;under the direct control and authority of the nigh commissioner.&nbsp;The commandant-general is paid by the British parliament. The&nbsp;offices of commandant-general and resident commissioner were combined in 1905.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The Southern Rhodesia Volunteers, in two divisions, eastern and western, under command of colonels, number altogether 86 officers&nbsp;and 1700 non-commissioned officers and men.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Medical.—</span><span class="font2">There are, including cottage hospitals, ten hospitals in towns and townships, and thirteen district surgeries have been&nbsp;established.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(G. Du.)</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeology.—</span><span class="font1">Between the Zambezi and the Limpopo, and extending from the coast to at least 27° E., may be found the&nbsp;traces of a large population which inhabited Southern Rhodesia&nbsp;and Portuguese East Africa in bygone times. Apart from&nbsp;numerous mines, some of which are being successfully reworked at the present day, ruins of stone buildings have been&nbsp;found in several hundred distinct places. Few of these have&nbsp;been explored systematically, but investigations in 1905,&nbsp;though confined to a small number of sites, determined at</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">least the main questions of date and origin. The fanciful theories of popular writers, who had ascribed these buildings&nbsp;to a remote antiquity, and had even been so audacious as to&nbsp;identify their founders with the subjects of King Solomon or&nbsp;of his contemporary the queen of Sheba, are now seen to be&nbsp;untenable. J. T. Bent’s </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ruined Cities of Mashonaland</span><span class="font1"> (1892)&nbsp;is now interesting only for its illustrations, and his theories&nbsp;are&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obsolete. Positive archaeological&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evidence&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;demonstrates</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">that the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Great Zimbabwe ” itself,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;famous&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imposing of the misnamed&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“ Ruined&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cities,”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">not &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;built&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;before medieval times, and&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earliest&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;date</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">which can be assigned to any of the sites explored is subsequent to the nth century a.d. Moreover, the complete identity of custom, revealed no less by the details of the dwellings than by the type of the articles found within them, proves&nbsp;that the tribe that built these structures was one closely akin&nbsp;to if not actually identical with the present Bantu inhabitants&nbsp;of the country.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">These ruins, even when stripped of their false romance, are of extreme interest; but their nature and appearance have&nbsp;been much' misunderstood, and the skill and intelligence required for their erection have been grossly overestimated.&nbsp;It should be clearly stated, therefore, that the methods of the&nbsp;old Rhodesians evince their complete ignorance of all the&nbsp;devices employed in the architecture of civilized peoples.&nbsp;They have not attempted to solve the problems of supporting&nbsp;weight and pressure by the use of pillar, arch or beam; the&nbsp;ingenuity of the builders goes no further than the dexterous&nbsp;heaping up of stones. Indeed, their most finished and elaborate work must be compared with nothing more ambitious&nbsp;than the dry-built walls which serve to enclose the fields in&nbsp;certain parts of England. The material is the local granite or&nbsp;diorite obtainable in the immediate neighbourhood. Stone-hewing has not been practised; and was unnecessary, since&nbsp;the natural flaking of the boulders provides an abundance&nbsp;of ready-made slabs which need only be detached from the&nbsp;parent rock and broken to the required size. At most the&nbsp;blocks thus obtained have been very roughly trimmed with&nbsp;one or two blows, and any apparent regularity in the fitting&nbsp;has been obtained merely by judicious selection. Mortar&nbsp;has seldom been used; the courses are never laid with any&nbsp;approach to exactness; walls merely abut on one another&nbsp;without being bonded, and the same line often varies greatly&nbsp;in thickness at different parts.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The main principle of the ground plan is invariably circular or elliptical, though it is carried out with a conspicuous lack&nbsp;of symmetry or exactness. Straight lines are unknown, and&nbsp;even accidental approximations to an angle are rare. This&nbsp;is eminently characteristic of the Bantu, w’hose huts are&nbsp;.commonly built in circular form. Indeed, it is the round Bantu&nbsp;hut w’hich has been the original model for even the finest&nbsp;of these stone constructions. The connexion between the&nbsp;two, however, goes beyond mere resemblance. The stone&nbsp;walls are always accompanied by huts; they are mere partitions or ring-fences enclosing and structurally inseparable from&nbsp;platforms of clay or cement on which stand the remains of&nbsp;precisely the same dwellings that the Makalanga make at the&nbsp;present day. Buildings such as those at Dhlo Dhlo, Nana-tali and Khami in Matabeleland, or at Zimbabwe in southern&nbsp;Mashonaland, are merely fortified </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">kraals·,</span><span class="font1"> remarkable indeed&nbsp;as the work of an African people, but essentially native African&nbsp;in every detail, not excepting the ornamentation.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The best-known and the most attractive of the Rhodesian ruins are those situated in the more central and southern&nbsp;region. In the north-east, however, the remains are even&nbsp;more numerous, though the single units are less remarkable.&nbsp;Over the whole of Inyanga and the Mazoe region are distributed hill-forts, pit-dwellings and intrenchments which are&nbsp;more primitive in character though of the same generic type as&nbsp;those found farther south. The inhabitants of these northern&nbsp;districts were occupied more in agriculture than in gold-mining,&nbsp;and one of the most striking features of their settlements is the</span></p><div style="border-top:solid;"></div><br clear="all"/>
