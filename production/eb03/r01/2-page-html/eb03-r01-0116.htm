<p><span class="font1">.with great force : but as to fire, light, and electricity, our experiments fail; nay, the ſuppoſition of a repulſtve&nbsp;power among the particles of the electric fluid is incon-ſiſtent with the phenomena, as has been demonſtrated&nbsp;under the article Electricity, Sect. V. and VI. E-ven in thofe fluids, air and ſteam, wherc a repulſtve&nbsp;power moſt manifeſtly exiſts, it is demonſtrable that the&nbsp;repulſion cannot be a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primary</span><span class="font1"> quality, ſince it can be&nbsp;increaſed to a great degree by heat, and diminiſhed by&nbsp;cold : but it is impoſſible that a </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">primary</span><span class="font1"> quality ol&nbsp;matter can be increaſed or diminiſhed by any external&nbsp;circumſtances whatever; for whatever property depends&nbsp;upon external circumftances, is not a primary but a ſe-condary one.—The repulſion of electrified bodies is explained under the article Electricity : that of others&nbsp;⅛ leſs ſubject to inveſtigation ; and the moſt that can&nbsp;be ſaid concerning it is, that in many caſes it ſeems to&nbsp;■be the conſequence of a modi; cation ot dire, and in&nbsp;others of electricity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">REPUTATION means credit, honour, or the character of good ; and ſince we are deſtined to live&nbsp;in ſociety, is neceſſary and uſeful more or leſs to every&nbsp;human being. There is no man, except one who is&nbsp;overgrown with pride and ſelf-conceit, or whoſe actions&nbsp;are bad, but pays attention to his reputation, and wiſhes to poſſeſs the good opinion of his neighbours or the&nbsp;world. The love of reputation and of fame are moſt&nbsp;powerful ſprings of action ; but though they proceed&nbsp;.from the ſame principle, the means of attaining them,&nbsp;and the effects of them, are not altogether the fame.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Many means indeed ſerve equally to ſupport the refutation and to increaſe the fame, differing only in degrees; others, however, bel-mg peculiarly either to the one -or to the other. An honeſt reputation is within the reach&nbsp;-of the bulk of mankind; it is obtained by the ſocial virtues and the conſtant practice of the common duties of&nbsp;life. This kind of reputation indeed is neither extensive nor brilliant, but it is ften the moſt uſeful in point&nbsp;of happinefs. Wit, talents, and genius, are the neceffary requiſttes for fame ; but thoſe advantages are perhaps leſs real in their conſequences than thoſe aiding&nbsp;from a good reputation, what is of real uſe coils&nbsp;little ; things rare and fplendid require the greateſt la-hour to procure, and yield perhaps a more ideal happineſs.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Fame can be poſſeſſed, comparatively ſpeaking, but •by few individuals ; as it requires either very ſuperior&nbsp;abilities, ſupported by great efforts, or very fortunate&nbsp;circumſtances. It is conſtituted by the applauſe of&nbsp;mankind, or at leaſt by that of a. ſingle nation ; whilſt&nbsp;reputation is of much leſs extent, and ariſes from different circumftances. I hat reputation which is founded&nbsp;on deceit and artifice is never ſolid ; and the moſt honourable will always be found to be the moſt uſeful.&nbsp;Every one may ſafely, and indeed ought to, afpire to&nbsp;the conſideration and praiſe due to his condition and&nbsp;merit ; bur hc who aſpires to moi e, or who ſeeks it by&nbsp;diſhoneſt means, will at length meet with contempt.</span></p>
