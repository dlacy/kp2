            <p>SS or s, the eighteenth letter and fourteenth consonant of our alphabet. The sound of
                it is formed by driving the breath through a narrow passage between the palate and
                the tongue elevated near it, together with a motion of the lower jaw and teeth
                towards the upper, the lips being a little way open, with such a configuration of
                every part of the mouth and larynx as renders the voice somewhat sibilous and
                hissing. Its sound, however, varies, being strong in some words, as <hi
                    rend="italic">this, thus,</hi> and soft in words which have a final <hi
                    rend="italic">e,</hi> as <hi rend="italic">muse, wise.</hi> It is generally
                doubled at the end of words, by which they become hard and harsh, as in <hi
                    rend="italic">kiss, loss.</hi> In some words it is silent, as <hi rend="italic"
                    >isle, island, viscount.</hi></p>
            <p>In abbreviation, S. stands for <hi rend="italic">societas</hi> or <hi rend="italic"

                fellow of the royal society. In medicinal prescriptions, S. A. signifies <hi
                    rend="italic">secundum artem,</hi> according to the rules of art. And in the
                notes of the ancients, S. stands for <hi rend="italic">Sextus ;</hi> S. P. for <hi
                    rend="italic">Spurius ;</hi> S. C. for <hi rend="italic">senatus consultum
                    ;</hi> S. P. Q. R. for <hi rend="italic">senatus populusque Romanns ; </hi>S. S.
                S. for <hi rend="italic">stratum superstrαtum,</hi> one layer above another
                alternately ; S. V. B. E. E. Q. V. for <hi rend="italic">si vales bene est, ego
                    quoque valeo,</hi> a form used in Cicero’s time in the beginning of letters.
                Used as a numeral, S. anciently denoted seven ; in the Italian music, S. signifies
                    <hi rend="italic">solo ;</hi> and in books of navigation, S. stands for south,
                S. E. for south-east, S. W. for south-west, S. S. E. for south-south-east, S. S. W.
                for south- south-west, &amp;c.</p>

                in the district. It is the residence of an imam or chief, whose power is limited,
                and his territories small ; and he is often so hard pressed by his highland
                neighbours that he finds it difficult to maintain his ground. He imposes a duty on
                all goods passing from Yemen into the interior of Arabia, and from this source his
                revenue chiefly arises. It is 368 miles north-north-east of Mocha.</p>

                1541. From his infancy he was very fond of books ; but he applied himself wholly to
                books of entertainment, such as novels and poetry of all kinds, especially Spanish
                and Italian authors. From Spain he went to Italy, either to serve Cardinal Aquaviva,
                to whom he was chamberlain at Rome, or else to follow the profession of a soldier,
                as he did for some years under the victorious banners of Marco Antonio Colonna. He
