<p><span class="font1">Edward Guinness (afterwards Lord Iveagh) with regard to the latter’s projected gift of ¿200,000 for endowment of a trust&nbsp;for the improvement of the dwellings of the working classes,&nbsp;Rowton made himself personally familiar with the conditions&nbsp;of the poorest inhabitants of London; and he determined&nbsp;to establish “ a poor man’s hotel,” which should offer better&nbsp;accommodation than the common lodging-houses, at similar&nbsp;prices. In the face of much discouragement and difficulty,&nbsp;the first Rowton House was opened at Vauxhall in December&nbsp;1892, the cost (¿30,000) being defrayed by Lord Rowton, though&nbsp;he was by no means a man of great wealth. In 1894 a company, Rowton Houses (Limited), was incorporated to extend&nbsp;the scheme, a main characteristic of which was that the houses&nbsp;should not be charitable institutions but should be on a paying&nbsp;commercial basis. The scheme proved a gratifying success,&nbsp;and was imitated not only in many of the chief towns of Great&nbsp;Britain, but also in different countries of Europe and in America&nbsp;(see Housing). Lord Rowton also devoted himself to the&nbsp;business of the Guinness Trust, of which he was a trustee, and&nbsp;was interested in many philanthropic schemes. Lord Rowton&nbsp;was unmarried, and the title consequently became extinct at&nbsp;his death, which occurred in London on the 9th of November&nbsp;1903.</span></p>

After the latter’s&nbsp;death she gave birth at Babylon to a son (Alexander IV.), who&nbsp;was accepted by the generals as joint-king with Arrhidaeus.&nbsp;Having crossed over to Macedonia, and thrown in her lot with&nbsp;Olympias, mother of Alexander the Great, she was imprisoned&nbsp;by Cassander in the fortress of Amphipolis and put to death&nbsp;(310 or 309 b.c.). The marriage of Alexander and Roxana was&nbsp;the subject of a famous painting by Aetion.</span></p>

<p><span class="font1">ROXBURGHE, EARLS AND DUKES OF. </span><span class="font1" style="font-variant:small-caps;">Robert Ker, 1st earl of Roxburghe </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font1"> 1570-1650), was the eldest son'of William&nbsp;Ker of Cessford (d. 1606) and the grandson of Sir Walter Ker&nbsp;(d. c. 1584), who fought against Mary queen of Scots both at&nbsp;Carberry Hill and at Langside. He was descended from Sir&nbsp;Andrew Ker of Cessford (d. 1526) who fought at Flodden and&nbsp;was killed near Melrose in January 1526 by the Scotts of&nbsp;Buccleuch. The deed was avenged when the Kers under Sir&nbsp;Walter killed Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch in Edinburgh in&nbsp;1552. Robert Ker was also descended, on the maternal side,&nbsp;from Andrew Ker of Femiehurst (c. 1471-1545), a celebrated&nbsp;border chieftain. Another famous member of the family was&nbsp;Andrew’s grandson, Sir Thomas Ker of Femiehurst (d. 1586),&nbsp;who, Camden says, was “of an immovable fidelity to the queen&nbsp;of Scots and the king her son.” He was the father of Robert&nbsp;Carr, earl of Somerset, the favourite of James I.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">After a turbulent life on the border Robert Ker became a Scottish privy councillor in 1599 and was made Lord Roxburghe&nbsp;about the same time; he accompanied King James to London&nbsp;in 1603, and was created earl of Roxburghe in 1616. He was&nbsp;lord privy seal for Scotland from 1637 to 1649, and in the&nbsp;Scottish parliament he showed his sympathy with Charles I.;&nbsp;but he took no part in the Civil War, although he signed the&nbsp;“ engagement ” for the king’s release in 1648. He died at&nbsp;Floors, his residence near Kelso, on the 18th of January 1650.&nbsp;His son Harry, Lord Ker, had died in January 1643; consequently his titles and estates passed by special arrangement to&nbsp;his grandson, William Drummond (d. 1675), the youngest son&nbsp;of his daughter Jean and her husband John Drummond, 2nd&nbsp;earl of Perth. William took the name of Ker, became 2nd earl&nbsp;of Roxburghe, and married his cousin Lord Ker’s daughter Jean.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The second earl’s son was Robert, 3rd earl (c. 1658-1682), whose son was John, 1st duke of Roxburghe (c. 1680-1741).&nbsp;John became 5th earl on the death of his brother Robert, the&nbsp;4th earl, in 1696, and is described by George Lockhart of Carn-wath as “ perhaps the best accomplished young man of quality&nbsp;in Europe.” In 1704 he was made a secretary of state of</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">Scotland, and he helped to bring about the union with England, being created duke of Roxburghe in 1707 for his services in this&nbsp;connexion. This was the last creation in the Scottish peerage.&nbsp;The duke was a representative peer for Scotland in four parliaments; George I. made him a privy councillor and keeper of&nbsp;the privy seal of Scotland, and he was loyal to the king during&nbsp;the Jacobite rising in 1715. He was again a secretary of state&nbsp;from 1716 to 1725, but he opposed the malt-tax, and in 1725&nbsp;Sir Robert Walpole procured his dismissal from office. He&nbsp;died on the 24th of February 1741. His only son, Robert&nbsp;(c. 1709-1755), who had been created Earl Ker of Wakefield in&nbsp;1722, became 2nd duke, and was succeeded by his son John, 3rd&nbsp;duke of Roxburghe (1740-1804), the famous bibliophile. John&nbsp;was betrothed to Christiana, daughter of the duke of Mecklen-burg-Strelitz; but when the princess’s sister Charlotte was&nbsp;affianced to George III., reasons of state led to the rupture of the&nbsp;engagement, and he died unmarried on the 19th of March 1804.&nbsp;The duke’s library, including a unique collection of books from&nbsp;Caxton’s press, and three rare volumes of broadside ballads, was&nbsp;sold in 1812, when the Roxburghe Club was founded to commemorate the sale of Valdarfcr’s edition of Boccaccio. Rox-burghe’s cousin William, 7th Lord Bellenden </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">(c.</span><span class="font1"> 1728-1805),&nbsp;who succeeded to the Scottish titles and estates, died childless&nbsp;in October 1805, and for seven years the titles were dormant.&nbsp;Then in 1812 Sir James Innes, bart. (1736-1823), a descendant&nbsp;of the 1 st earl, established his claim to them, and taking the&nbsp;name of Innes-Ker, became 5th duke of Roxburghe. Among&nbsp;the unsuccessful claimants to the Roxburghe dukedom was John&nbsp;Bellenden Ker (c. 1765-1842), famous as a wit and botanist&nbsp;and the author of </span><span class="font1" style="font-style:italic;">Archaeology of Popular Phrases and Nursery&nbsp;Rhymes</span><span class="font1"> (1837), whose son was the legal reformer, Charles Henry&nbsp;Bellenden Ker (c. 1785-1871).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">The 5th duke’s great-grandson, Henry John Innes-Ker (b. 1876), became 8th duke in 1892. The duke of Roxburghe&nbsp;sits in the House of Lords as Earl limes, a peerage of the United&nbsp;Kingdom, which was conferred in 1837 upon James Henry, the&nbsp;6th duke (1816-1879).</span></p>
<p><span class="font1">ROXBURGHSHIRE, a Border county of Scotland, bounded W. by Berwickshire, E. and S.E. by Northumberland, S. by&nbsp;Cumberland, S.W. by Dumfriesshire and N.W. by the shires of&nbsp;Selkirk and Mid Lothian. It has an area of 426,060 acres, or&nbsp;665-7 sq. m. The only low-lying ground in the shire is found in&nbsp;the N. and in the valleys of the larger rivers, and the whole S.&nbsp;is markedly hilly. Though the Cheviots, forming for a considerable distance the natural boundary with England, mostly&nbsp;belong to Northumberland, Catcleuch Shin (1742 ft.) and Peel&nbsp;Fell (1964) are Scottish peaks. The chief heights of the mountainous mass constituting the watershed between Teviotdale&nbsp;and Liddesdale are Cauldcleuch Head (1996), Great moor (1964),&nbsp;Pennygant (1805), Din Fell (1735), Windburgh (1622) and&nbsp;Amton Fell (1464). In the W. is Crib Law (1369), and in the&nbsp;N., near Melrose, occur the triple Eildons (highest peak, 1385).&nbsp;The county is abundantly watered. The Tweed flows through&nbsp;the N. of the shire for 26 out of its total run of 97 m., though for&nbsp;about 2 m. (near Abbotsford) it is the boundary stream with&nbsp;Selkirkshire, and for 10 m. lower down with Berwickshire&nbsp;(parishes of Earlston and Merton). On the right its affluents&nbsp;are the Bowden and the Teviot, and on the left the Allan and&nbsp;the Eden. The Teviot is the principal river lying entirely in&nbsp;Roxburghshire. From its source near Causeway Grain Head on&nbsp;the Dumfriesshire border, it follows mainly a N.E. direction for&nbsp;37 m. to its confluence with the Tweed at Kelso. Its chief&nbsp;tributaries are, on the right, Allan Water, the Slitrig, Dean Bum,&nbsp;the Rule, the Jed, the Oxnam and the Kale, and, on the left,&nbsp;Borthwick Water and the Ale, both rising in Selkirkshire. The&nbsp;Liddel is the leading stream in the S. Rising near Peel Fell in&nbsp;the Cheviots it flows S.W. to the Esk after a course of 27 m.,&nbsp;receiving on the right Hermitage Water, on the left Kershope&nbsp;Bum. The Kershope and Liddel, during part of their run, serve&nbsp;as boundaries with Cumberland. Excepting the Liddel, which&nbsp;drains to the Esk, much the greater portion of the surface is&nbsp;drained, by the Tweed, to the North Sea. The lakes are few</span></p>
