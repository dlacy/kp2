        <p><span class="font1">to the Liris as the champion of the comparatively civilized
                communities of the lowlands against the rude highland&nbsp;tribes which threatened
                to overrun them, and so, when her&nbsp;legions first crossed the Liris, it was in
                answer to an appeal&nbsp;from a lowland city against invaders from the hills.
                While&nbsp;she was engaged in clearing Latium of Volsci and&nbsp;Æqui, the Sabellian
                tribes of the central Apennines had&nbsp;rapidly spread over the southern half of
                the peninsula.&nbsp;Foremost among these tribes were the Samnites, a portion of whom
                had captured the Etruscan city of Capua in&nbsp;. 423, the Greek Cumæ in 420, and
                had since then ruled&nbsp;as masters over the fertile Campanian territory. But
                in&nbsp;their new homes the conquerors soon lost all sense of&nbsp;relationship and
                sympathy with their highland brethren.&nbsp;They dwelt in cities, amassed wealth,
                and inherited the&nbsp;civilization of the Greeks and Etruscans whom they
                had&nbsp;dispossessed ;@@<sup>1</sup> above all, they had before long to
                defend&nbsp;themselves in their turn against the attacks of their ruder&nbsp;kinsmen
                from the hills, and it was for aid against these&nbsp;that the Samnites of Campania
                appealed to the rising&nbsp;state which had already made herself known as the
                bulwark of the lowlands north of the Liris, and which with&nbsp;her Latin and
                Hernican allies had scarcely less interest&nbsp;than the Campanian cities themselves
                in checking the&nbsp;raids of the highland Samnite tribes.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">The Campanian appeal was listened to. Rome with her confederates
                entered into alliance with Capua and the&nbsp;neighbouring Campanian towns, and war
                was formally&nbsp;declared (343) against the Samnites.@@<sup>2</sup> While to
                the&nbsp;Latins and Hernicans was entrusted apparently the defence&nbsp;of Latium
                and the Hernicän valley against the northerly&nbsp;members of the Samnite
                confederacy, the Romans themselves undertook the task of driving the invaders out
                of&nbsp;Campania. After two campaigns the war was ended in&nbsp;341 by a treaty, and
                the Samnites withdrew from the&nbsp;lowlands, leaving Rome the recognized suzerain
                of the&nbsp;Campanian cities which had sought her aid.@@<sup>3</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">There is no doubt that the check thus given by Rome to the advance of
                the hitherto invincible Sabellian highlanders not only made her the natural head and
                champion&nbsp;of the low countries, south as well as north of the Liris,&nbsp;but
                also considerably added to her prestige. Carthage&nbsp;sent her congratulations, and
                the Etruscan city of Falerii&nbsp;voluntarily enrolled herself among the allies of
                Rome.&nbsp;Of even greater service, however, was the fact that&nbsp;for fifteen
                years the Samnites remained quiet, for this&nbsp;inactivity, whatever its cause,
                enabled Rome triumphantly&nbsp;to surmount a danger which threatened for the
                moment&nbsp;to wreck her whole position. This danger was nothing&nbsp;less than a
                desperate effort on the part of nearly all her&nbsp;allies and dependents south of
                the Tiber to throw off the&nbsp;yoke of her supremacy. The way was led by her
                ancient&nbsp;confederates the Latins, whose smouldering discontent&nbsp;broke into
                open flame directly the fear of a Samnite attack&nbsp;was removed. From the Latin
                Campagna and the&nbsp;Sabine hills the revolt spread westward and southward&nbsp;to
                Antium and Tarracina, and even to the towns of the&nbsp;Campanian plain, where the
                mass of the inhabitants at&nbsp;once repudiated the alliance formed with Rome
                by&nbsp;the ruling class. The struggle was sharp but short. In&nbsp;two pitched
                    battles@@<sup>4</sup> the strength of the insurrection&nbsp;was broken, and two
                more campaigns sufficed for the&nbsp;complete reduction of such of the insurgent
                communities as still held out. The revolt crushed, Rome set her-</span></p>

        <p><span class="font1">self deliberately to the task of re-establishing on a new and firmer
                basis her supremacy over the lowlands, and in&nbsp;doing so laid the foundations of
                that marvellous organization which was destined to spread rapidly over Italy,
                and&nbsp;to withstand the attacks even of Haunibal. The old&nbsp;historic Latin
                league ceased to exist, though its memory&nbsp;was still preserved by the yearly
                Latin festival on the&nbsp;Alban Mount. Most if not all of the common land of
                the&nbsp;league became Roman territory;@@<sup>5</sup> five at least of the
                old&nbsp;Latin cities were compelled to accept the Roman franchise@@<sup>6</sup> and
                enter the pale of the Roman state. The rest,&nbsp;with the Latin colonies, were
                ranked as Latin allies of&nbsp;Rome, but on terms which secured their complete
                dependence upon the sovereign city. The policy of isolation,&nbsp;which became so
                cardinal a principle of Roman rule, was&nbsp;now first systematically applied. No
                rights of “con-nubium ” or “ commercium ” were any longer to exist&nbsp;between
                these communities. Their federal councils were&nbsp;prohibited, and all federal
                action independent of Rome&nbsp;forbidden.@@<sup>7</sup></span></p>
        <p><span class="font1">In future they were to have nothing in common but their common
                connexion with Rome, a connexion based&nbsp;in each case on a separate treaty
                between the individual&nbsp;Latin community and Rome. The Latin allied
                state&nbsp;retained its internal independence and the old rights
                of&nbsp;intermarriage and commerce with Rome, but it lost all&nbsp;freedom of action
                in external affairs. It could wage&nbsp;no wars, conclude no treaties, and was
                bound, so the&nbsp;phrase ran, to have always the same foes and friends&nbsp;as Rome
                herself. In Campania and the coast-lands&nbsp;connecting Campania with Rome, a
                policy of annexation was considered safer than that of alliance. Of the&nbsp;two
                frontier posts of the Volsci, Antium and Velitræ,&nbsp;the former was constituted a
                Roman colony, its long&nbsp;galleys burnt and their prows set up in the Forum
                at&nbsp;Rome, while the walls of Velitræ were razed to the&nbsp;ground, its leading
                men banished beyond the Tiber, and&nbsp;their lands given to Roman settlers. Farther
                south on&nbsp;the route to Campania, Fundi and Formiæ were, after the&nbsp;precedent
                set in the case of Cære, declared Roman and&nbsp;granted the civil rights of Roman
                citizenship, while lastly&nbsp;in Campania itself the same status was given to
                Capua,&nbsp;Cumæ, and the smaller communities dependent
                    upon&nbsp;them.@@<sup>8</sup> During the ten years from 338 to 328 the&nbsp;work
                of settlement was steadily continued. Tarracina, like&nbsp;Antium, was made a Roman
                colony. Privernum, the last&nbsp;Volscian town to offer resistance to Rome, was
                subdued&nbsp;in 330, part of its territory allotted to Roman citizens, and&nbsp;the
                state itself forced to accept the Roman ’franchise.&nbsp;Lastly, to strengthen the
                lines of defence against the&nbsp;Sabellian tribes, two colonies with the rights of
                Latin&nbsp;allies were established at Fregellæ and at Cales. The&nbsp;settlement of
                the lowlands was accomplished. From the&nbsp;Ciminian forest to the southern
                extremity of the Campanian plain, the lands lying between the sea and the
                hills&nbsp;were now, w<sup>τ</sup>ith few exceptions, Roman territory,
                while&nbsp;along the frontiers from Sutrium and Nepete in the north&nbsp;to Cales in
                the south stretched the protecting line of the&nbsp;Latin allied states and
                colonies. As a single powerful&nbsp;and compact state with an outer circle of
                closely dependent&nbsp;allies, Rome now stood in sharp contrast with the
                disunited&nbsp;and degenerate cities of northern Etruria, the loosely&nbsp;organized
                tribes of the Apennines, and the decaying and&nbsp;disorderly’Greek towns of the
                south.</span></p>
