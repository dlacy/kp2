<p><span class="font2">Rabah to return to Bornu. He gave the British no further trouble, but turned his attention to the French. Émile Gentil&nbsp;had in this same year (1897) reached Lake Chad, via the Congo&nbsp;and Bagirmi, and had installed a French resident with the&nbsp;sultan of Bagirmi. As soon as Gentil had withdrawn, Rabah&nbsp;again fell upon Bagirmi, and forced sultan and resident to flee.&nbsp;In 1899 the French sent an expedition to reconquer the country,&nbsp;but at first they were unsuccessful. In the summer of 1899&nbsp;Rabah attacked and routed the French advanced post, held&nbsp;by Naval-Lieutenant Bretonnet, and the latter was killed.&nbsp;In October following another battle was fought, in which the&nbsp;French, under Captain Robillot, completely defeated Rabah,&nbsp;who retreated north-east towards Wadai. Gathering a fresh&nbsp;army, he returned to Bagirmi and joined issue with the French&nbsp;a third time. In a battle fought on the 22nd of April 1900&nbsp;Rabah was slain and his host defeated. The chieftain’s head&nbsp;was cut off and taken to the French camp. In this engagement Major Lamy, the French commandant, also lost his&nbsp;life.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">The French continued the campaign against Rabah’s sons, two of whom were killed. Rabah had left instructions that if&nbsp;his army was finally defeated by the French, his successor&nbsp;should return to Bornu and make friends with the British.&nbsp;Rabah’s third son, Fader-Allah, accordingly threw himself&nbsp;entirely upon British protection. He made a favourable impression, and it was contemplated to recognize him as sultan of&nbsp;Bornu. However, in the later part of 1901 Fader-Allah, who&nbsp;had 2500 riflemen, again made aggressive movements against&nbsp;the French. In retaliation, Captain Dangeville pursued him&nbsp;into British territory. A battle was fought at Gujba, Fader-Allah being defeated. He fled mortally wounded, and died&nbsp;the same night, being buried in the bed of a small river, the&nbsp;course of which had been diverted for the purpose.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Connected accounts of Rabah’s career are contained in É.

<p><span class="font2">RABAT </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">(Ribàt),</span><span class="font2"> a city on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, in 34° 3' N., 6° 46' W., 130 m. S. of Cape Spartel, on the&nbsp;southern side and at the mouth of the Bu Ragrag, which&nbsp;separates it from Salli on the northern bank. It is a commercial&nbsp;town of about 26, 000 to 30, 000 inhabitants, occupying a rocky&nbsp;plateau and surrounded by massive but dilapidated walls,&nbsp;strengthened by three forts on the seaward side. To the&nbsp;south of the town stands a modern palace, defended by earthworks and Krupp guns. The conspicuous feature in the view&nbsp;from the ocean is the Borj el Hasan, an unfinished square-built&nbsp;tower, 145 ft. high, built on an elevation about 65 ft. above&nbsp;the sea to the west of the walled town. At one time the Bu&nbsp;Ragrag afforded a much better harbour than it does now;&nbsp;the roadstead is quite unprotected, and there is a dangerous&nbsp;bar at the mouth of the river, which hampers the shipping,&nbsp;and makes the growth of trade slow. The depth of water&nbsp;over the bar varies from 7 to 12 ft. Rabat trades with Fez&nbsp;and the interior of Morocco, with the neighbouring coast towns&nbsp;and Gibraltar, and with Marseilles, Manchester and London,&nbsp;and is the greatest industrial centre in Morocco.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Rabat was founded by Yak'ub el Mansur in 1184, but Salli was then already an ancient city, and on the scarped hills&nbsp;to the west of Rabat stand the ruins of Sala, a Roman colony,&nbsp;known as Sheila. It contains a mausoleum of the Beni Marin&nbsp;dynasty.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">RABAUT, PAUL (1718-1794), French pastor of “ the Church of the Desert ” (see Huguenots), was born at Bédarieux, near&nbsp;Montpellier, on the 29th of January 1718. In 1738 he was&nbsp;admitted as a preacher by the synod of Languedoc, and in 1740 he went to Lausanne to complete his studies in the&nbsp;seminary recently founded there by Antoine Court (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v. </span><span class="font2">). In 1741 Rabaut was placed at the head of the church of Nîmes,&nbsp;and in 1744 he was vice-president of the general synod.&nbsp;During the persecution of 1745-1752 Rabaut himself was&nbsp;obliged to hide. When the marquis of Paulmy d’Argenson&nbsp;was sent to Languedoc to make a military inspection, Rabaut&nbsp;succeeded in interviewing him (1750). For a time the persecution ceased, but it broke out again in 1753, a price&nbsp;being put upon Rabaut’s head. Louis François de Bourbon,&nbsp;prince de Conti, interested himself in the Protestants in 1755,&nbsp;and in July Rabaut visited him. During the years 1755-1760&nbsp;periods of persecution and toleration alternated. By the&nbsp;year 1760, however, the efforts of Antoine Court and P. Rabaut&nbsp;had been so successful that French Protestantism was well&nbsp;established and organized. Court de Gébelin, Paul Rabaut,&nbsp;and his son Saint-Étienne now exerted themselves to get it&nbsp;recognized by the law and government. When the people&nbsp;revolted, the minister Turgot in 1775 requested Rabaut to&nbsp;calm them. His success aroused the jealousy of his colleagues,&nbsp;who tried to undo the good work started by Antoine Court.&nbsp;But Rabaut persevered in his efforts to improve legally the&nbsp;position of the Protestants. In 1785, when he was visited&nbsp;by General La Fayette, it was arranged that Rabaut's son,&nbsp;Rabaut Saint-Étienne, should go to Paris on behalf of the&nbsp;Reformed Church. In November 1787 Louis XVI.’s edict of&nbsp;toleration was signed, though it was not registered until the&nbsp;29th of January 1788. Two years later liberty of conscience&nbsp;was proclaimed by the National Assembly, of which Rabaut&nbsp;Saint-Étienne was chosen vice-president, and it was declared&nbsp;that non-Catholics might be admitted to all positions. After&nbsp;the fall of the Girondists, however, in which Rabaut Saint-Étienne was involved, Paul Rabaut, who had refused to renounce&nbsp;his title of pastor, was arrested, dragged to the citadel of Nîmes,&nbsp;and kept in prison seven weeks (1794). He died at Nîmes on&nbsp;the 25th of September 1794, soon after his release.</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">RABAUT SAINT-ÉTIENNE, JEAN PAUL (1743-1793), French revolutionist, was born at Nîmes, the son of Paul&nbsp;Rabaut (</span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">q.v. </span><span class="font2">), the additional surname of Saint-Étienne being&nbsp;assumed from a small property near Nîmes. Like his father,&nbsp;he became a pastor, and distinguished himself by his zeal&nbsp;for his co-religionists, working energetically to obtain the&nbsp;recognition of the civil rights which had been granted to them&nbsp;by Louis XVI. in 1788. Having gained a great reputation by&nbsp;his </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">Histoire primitive de la Grèce,</span><span class="font2"> he was elected deputy to the&nbsp;States General in 1789 by the third estate of the </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">bailliage</span><span class="font2"> of&nbsp;Nîmes. In the Constituent Assembly he worked on the framing&nbsp;of the constitution, spoke against the establishment of the&nbsp;republic, which he considered ridiculous, and voted for the&nbsp;suspensive veto, as likely to strengthen the position of the&nbsp;crown. In the Convention he sat among the Girondists, opposed&nbsp;the trial of Louis XVI., was a member of the commission of&nbsp;twelve, and was proscribed with his party. He remained in&nbsp;hiding for some time, but was ultimately discovered and&nbsp;guillotined on the 5th of December 1793.</span></p>
