<p><span class="font0">nearly one third part of the whole shire having been sold within that period. There are about thirty seats of noblemen and gentlemen, besides villas belonging to merchants&nbsp;and tradesmen. There are also many remains of ancient&nbsp;structures, which formed the seats of powerful or respectable families. This shire was anciently covered with wood.&nbsp;Even now it is ornamented with many woods and plantations ; and it is in general well enclosed.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">As an agricultural district, this does not rank so high as some others in Scotland. Farms are generally small, seldom exceeding 100 acres on the arable land, and 400 or&nbsp;500 acres on the hills. In 1811 the average rent per English acre was about fifteen shillings, varying from two or&nbsp;three shillings to four or five pounds ; partly owing to situation, but still more to the different degrees of the natural fertility of the soil. The usual period of leases here,&nbsp;as in other parts of Scotland, is nineteen years ; but many&nbsp;are now shorter. The mode of farming is such as every year&nbsp;to leave more than a half of the arable land in grass, on which&nbsp;the stock chiefly kept is cows, the most part of whose milk&nbsp;is made into butter. There are few cheese-dairies. The&nbsp;corn chiefly raised here consists of oats and bear. Wheat,&nbsp;barley, beans, and pease, are sown, but not in great quantities. Clover and rye-grass are sown only for hay. Turnips are much grown as a field crop. Potatoes are skilfully and extensively cultivated, the vast population of the&nbsp;district creating an extraordinary demand for a root so cheap&nbsp;and wholesome. A flock of Merino sheep was brought to&nbsp;this county from Spain in the year 1810, but the experiment proved unsuccessful.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is by its manufactures and commerce that this county is most distinguished. Goods of silk, and cotton, and muslin fabrics, are the principal articles manufactured. Cotton-mills, bleachfields, and printfields, furnish employment to a&nbsp;large portion of the inhabitants. Paisley and its environs&nbsp;form the chief seat of the manufactures. At Greenock and&nbsp;Port-Glasgow the foreign and coasting trade of the county,&nbsp;and, indeed, a great proportion of the foreign trade of&nbsp;Scotland, are carried on. To prevent repetition, we refer&nbsp;to the articles Paisley, Gbeenock, and Port-Glasgow,&nbsp;for information concerning the manufactures and commerce&nbsp;of Renfrewshire.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The other more considerable towns and villages, with their population in 1831, are as follow: Johnston, 5617 ;&nbsp;Pollockshaws, a burgh of barony, 4267 ; Lochwinnoch,&nbsp;2645 ; Barrhead and Newton Ralston, 2640 ; Kilbarchan,&nbsp;2333; Neilston, 1137 ; and Elderslie, 1099.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1755 tile population of the county was only 26,645; in 1831 itamounted to 133,443. The increase, therefore,&nbsp;in seventy-six years has been 106,995, being upwards of&nbsp;400 per cent., which exceeds that of any other county in&nbsp;Scotland.</span></p>

<p><span class="font0">RENNES, an arrondissement of the department of Ille and Vilaine, in France, extending over 532 square miles,&nbsp;and containing ten cantons, seventy-eight communes, and,&nbsp;in 1836, 130,838 inhabitants. The capital is the city of&nbsp;the same name, situated at the junction of the two rivers&nbsp;which give name to the department. It is the seat of the&nbsp;departmental government, as it was of that of the province&nbsp;of Normandy in former times. It stands on a fine plain,&nbsp;and, excepting the suburbs, is well built ; the parade being&nbsp;one of the finest squares in France. It has a cathedral&nbsp;and eight other churches, a fine exchange, and in 1836&nbsp;the population was 35,552. There are extensive linen&nbsp;manufactures, especially of sail-cloth for the royal navy.&nbsp;Cottons are made and printed, and many stockings are woven.&nbsp;Manyof theinhabitantsareemployed in building, equipping,&nbsp;and navigating vessels.

<p><span class="font0">RENNIE, John, a distinguished mechanist, architect, and civil engineer, was born on the 7th of June 1761, at&nbsp;Phantassie, in the parish of Prestonkirk, in the county of&nbsp;East Lothian. His father, a highly respectable farmer, died&nbsp;in 1766, leaving a widow and nine children, of whom John&nbsp;was the youngest. The first rudiments of his education w ere&nbsp;acquired at the village school; and as it frequently happens&nbsp;that some trifling circumstance in early life gives a bent to&nbsp;the pursuits and fixes the destinies of the future man, so&nbsp;it fared with young Rennie. The school was situated on&nbsp;the opposite side of a brook, over which it was necessary to&nbsp;pass by means of a rustic bridge of stepping stones ; but&nbsp;when the freshes were out, the only alternative of crossing&nbsp;the stream was by means of a boat, which was kept at the&nbsp;workshop of Mr Andrew Meikle, an ingenious mechanic,&nbsp;well knowm in Scotland as the inventor of the thrashing-machine, and many improvements in agricultural implements. In passing through this workshop, which stood on&nbsp;his family property, young Rennie’s attention was forcibly&nbsp;draw n to the various operations that were in progress, and&nbsp;a great part of his leisure and holiday time was passed therein. The sons of Mr Meikle, and the workmen, seeing the&nbsp;delight which he appeared to take in examining their labours, were in the habit of indulging him with their tools,&nbsp;and showing him their various uses. His evenings were&nbsp;chiefly employed in imitating those models which had particularly attracted his attention in the workshop ; and it is&nbsp;known in the family, that, at little more than ten years of&nbsp;age, he had constructed the model of a windmill, a pile-engine, and a steam-engine. That of the pile-engine is still&nbsp;in existence, and is said to be remarkably well made.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">Having continued at Preston school till twelve years of age, he had about that time a quarrel w<sup>,</sup>ith his schoolmaster,&nbsp;whom he deemed incompetent to give him further instruction, and therefore entreated that he might be permitted to&nbsp;leave the school. But his active mind soon became restless ; for the first time he felt the hours hang heavily on his&nbsp;hands ; and having expressed a wish to be placed under&nbsp;his friend Mr Meikle, lie employed himself with this ingenious mechanic for about two years ; but his mind expanding with his growth, he began to feel that the progress of his intellectual faculties was likely to be retarded&nbsp;by a constant application to manual labour. He therefore at length determined to place himself under the tuition</span></p>
