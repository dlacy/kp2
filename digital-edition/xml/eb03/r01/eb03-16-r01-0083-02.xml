                <p><label>REPRODUCTION</label>, is uſually underſtood to mean the restoration of
                    a thing before exiſting, and ſince deſtroyed. It is very well known that trees
                    and plants may be raiſed from Hips and cuttings ; and some late obſervations
                    have ſhown, that there are some animals which have the same property. The
                        polype<note anchored="true" place="margin" type="authorial" n="1">See <hi
                            rend="italic">Polypus</hi>.</note> was the ſirſt inſtance we had of this
                    ; but we had ſcarce time to wonder at the diſcovery Mr Trembley had made, when
                    Mr Bonett diſcovered the ſame property in a ſpecies of water-worm. Amongſt the
                    plants which may be raiſed from cuttings, there are ſome which ſeem to possess
                    this quality in ſo eminent a degree, that the ſmalleſt portion of them will
                    become a complete tree again.</p>
                <p>It deſerves inquiry, whether or not the great Author of nature, when he ordained
                    that certain infects, as these polypes and worms, ſhould reſemble thoſe plants
                    in that particular, allovzed them this power of being re-produced in the ſame
                    degree ? or, which is the Tame thing, whether this reproduction will or will not
                    take place in whatever part the worm is cut? fn order to try this, Mr Bonett
                    entered on a courfe of many experiments on the water-worms which have this
                    property. Theſe are, at their common growth, from two to three inches long, and
                    of a browniſh colour, with a caſt oſ reddiſh. From one of theſe worms he cut off
                    the head and tail, taking from each extremity only a ſmall piece of a twelfth of
                    an inch in length ; but neither of theſe pieces were able to reproduce what was
                    wanting. They both periſhed in about 24 hours ; the tail firſt,</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0084" facs="gri_33125011196389_0090.tif"/>
                <p>and afterwards tbe head. As to the body of the worm from which theſe pieces were
                    ſeparated, it lived as well as before, and ſeemed indeed to ſuffer nothing by
                    the loſs, the head-part being immediately uſed as if thfe head was thereon,
                    boring the creature’s way into the mud. There are, beſides this, two other
                    points in which the reproduction will not take place ; the one of theſe is about
                    the fifth or ſixth ring from the head, and the other at the ſame diſtance from
                    the tail ; and in all pro-bability the condition of the great artery in theſe
                    parts is the cauſe of this.</p>
                <p>what is ſaid of the want of the reproductive power of theſe parts relates only
                    to the head and tail ends ; for as to the body, it feels very little
                    inconvenience from the loſs of what is taken off, and very ſpeedily reproduces
                    thoſe parts, where then does the principle of life reſide in fuch worms, which,
                    after having their heads cut off, will have not only the ſame motions, but even
                    the inclinations, that they had before? and yet this difficulty is very ſmall,
                    compared to ſeveral others which at the ſame time offer themſelves to our
                    reaſon. Is this wonderful reproduction of parts only a natural conſe-quence of
                    the laws of motion ? or is there lodged in the body of the creature a chain of
                    minute buds or ſhoots, a fort of little embryos, already formed and placed in
                    £uch part3 where the reproductions are to begin ? Are thefe worms only mere
                    machines? or are they, like more perfect animals, a fort of compound, the
                    ſprings of whoſe motions are actuated or regulated by a fort of foul ? And if
                    they have themſelves ſuch a principle, how is it that this principle is
                    multiplied, and is found in every ſeparate piece ? Is it to be granted, that
                    there are in theſe worms, not a ſingle ſoul (if it is to be ſo call-ed) in each,
                    but that each contains as many fouls as there are pieces capable of reproducing
                    perfect animals ? Are we to believe with Malpighi, that theſe forts of worms are
                    all heart and brain from one end to the other! This may be ; but yet if we knew
                    that it was ſo, we ſhould know in reality but very little the more for knowing
                    it: and it ſeems, after all, that in caſes of this kind we are only to admire
                    the works of the great Creator, and ſit down in ſilence.</p>
                <p>The nice ſenſe of feeling in ſpiders has been much talked of by naturalifts ;
                    but it appears that thefe worms have yet ſomewhat more ſurpriſing in them in
                    regard to this particular. If a piece of ſtick, or any other ſubſtance, be
                    brought near them, they do not ſtay tor its touching them, but begin to leap and
                    friſk about as ſoon as it comes towards them. There want, however, ſome farther
                    experiments to aſcertain whether this be really owing to feeling or to ſight ;
                    for though we can diſcover no diſtinct organs of tight in theſe creatures, yet
                    they ſeem affected by the light of the ſun or a candle, and always friſk about
                    it in the ſame manner at the approach of either ; nay, even the moon-light has
                    ſome effect upon them.</p>
                <p>A twig of willow, poplar, or many other trees, be-ιng planted in the earth,
                    takes root, and becomes a tree, every piece of which will in the ſame manner
                    pro-duce other trees. The caſe is the ſame with theſe worms: they are cut to
                    pieces, and theſe ſeveral pieces become perfect animals ; and each of theſe may
                    be again cut into a number of pieces, each of which will in the ſame manner
                    produce an animal. It had been ſuppoſed by ſome that theſe worms were ovipaζous
                    t but Mr Bo-</p>
                <p>nett, on cutting one of them to pieces, having obſerved a ſiender ſubftance,
                    reſembling a ſmall filament, to move at the end of one of the pieces, ſeparated
                    it ; and on examining it with glaffes, found it to be a perfect worm, of the
                    ſame form with its parent, which lived and grew larger in a veffel of water into
                    which he put it. Theſe ſmall bodies are eafily divided, and very readily
                    complete themſelves again, a day uſually ſerving for the produc-tion of a head
                    to the part that wants one ; and, in <hi rend="italic">general,</hi> the
                    ſmaller and ilenderer the worms are, the ſooner they complete themſelves after
                    this operation, when, the bodies of the large worms are examined by the
                    microſcope, it is very eaſy to ſee the appearance of the young worms alive, and
                    moving about within them : but it requires great precifion and exactneſs to be
                    certain of this ; lince the ramifications of the great artery have very much the
                    appearance of young worms, and they are kept in a fort of continual motion by
                    the ſyſtolea. and diaftoles of the ſeveral portions of the artery, which ſerve
                    as ſo many hearts. It is very certain, that what we force in regard to theſe
                    animals by our operations, is done alſo naturally every day in the brooks and
                    ditches where they live. A curious obſerver will find in theſe places many of
                    them without heads or tails, and ſome without either; as alſo other fragments of
                    various kinds, aſl which are then in the act of completing them-ſelves : but
                    whether accidents have reduced them to this ſtate, or they thus purpoſely throw
                    off parts of their own body for the reproduction of more animals, it is not eaſy
                    to determine. They are plainly liable to many accidents, by which they loſe the
                    ſeveral parts of their body, and mnſt periſh very early if they had not a power
                    of reproducing what was loſt : they often are broken into two pieces, by the
                    refiſtance of feme hard piece of mud which they enter ; and they are ſubject to
                    a diſeaſe, a kind of gangrene, rotting off the ſeveral parts of their bodies,
                    and mnſt inevitably periſh by it,.. had they not this ſurprifing property.</p>
                <p>This worm was a ſecond inſtance, after the polype, of the ſurpriſtng power in an
                    animal of recovering its moſt effential parts when loſt. But Nature does not
                    ſeem to have limited her beneficence in this reſpect to theſe two creatures. Mr
                    Bonett tried the ſame expe-rimeπts on another ſpecies of water-worm, differing
                    from the former in being much.thicker. This kind of worm, when divided in the
                    ſummer-ſeaſon, very often ſhows the fame property: ſor if it be cut into three
                    or four pieces, the pieces wiſl lie like dead for a long time, but afterwards
                    will move about again ; and wiſl be found iu this ftate of reſt to have
                    recovered a head, or a tail, or both·. After recovering their parts, they move
                    very little⅝ and, according to this gentleman’s experiments, ſeldom ſlve more
                    than a month.</p>
                <p>it ſhould ſeem, that the more difficult luccefs of this laſt kind of worm, after
                    cutting, and the long time it takes to recover the loſt parts, iſ it do recover
                    them at aſl, is owing to its thickneſs ; fince we always find in that ſpecies of
                    worms which ſucceeds beſt of all, that thoſe which are thinneſt always recover
                    their parts much ſooner than the others.</p>
                <p>The water-inſects alſo are not the only creatures which have this power of
                    recovering their loſt parts. Tlie earth affords us ſome already diſcovered to
                    grow in this manner from their cuttings, and theſe not leſs deferring our
                    admiration than thoſe of the water : the</p>
                <pb xml:id="eb03-16-r01-0085" facs="gri_33125011196389_0091.tif"/>
                <p>common earth-worms are of this kind. Some of theſe worms have been divided into
                    two, others into three or four pieces ; and ſome oſ theſe pieces, after having
                    paſ-ied two or three months without any appearance of life or motion, have then
                    begun to reproduce a head or tail or both. The reproduction of the anus, alter
                    ſuch a flate of reſt, is no long work ; a few days do it : but it is otherwiſe
                    with the head, that does not ſeem to per-form its functions in the divided
                    pieces till about ſeven months after the ſeparation. ' It is to be obſerved,
                    that in all theſe operations both on earth and water-worms, the hinder part
                    ſuffers greatly more than the fore part in the cutting ; for it always twills
                    itſelf about a long time, as iſ actuated by ſtrong convulſions ; whereas the
                    head uſually crawls away without the appearance of any great uneaſineſs.</p>
                <p>The reproduction of ſeveral parts of lobſters, crabs, &amp;c. makes alſo one
                    of the great curioſities in natural hiſtory. That, in lieu of an organical part
                    of an animal broken off, another ſhall rife perfectly like it, may ſeem
                    inconſiſtent with the modern ſyſtem of generation, where the animal is ſuppoſed
                    to be wholly formed in the egg. Yet has the matter of fact been well atteſted by
                    the fiſhermen, and even by ſeveral virtuoſos who have taken the point into
                    examination, particularly M. de Reaumur and M. Perrault, whoſe ſkill and
                    exactneſs in things of this nature will hardly be queſtioned. The legs of
                    lobſters, &amp;c. conſiſt each of five articulations : now, when any of the
                    legs happen to break by any accident, as in walking, &amp;c. which
                    frequently happens, the fracture is always found to be in a part near the fourth
                    articulation ; and what they thus loſe is preciſe-ly reproduced ſome time
                    afterwards ; that is, a part of a leg ſhoots out, confiſting of four
                    articulations, the firſt whereof has two claws as before ; ſo that the loſs is
                    entirely repaired.</p>
                <p>If a lobſter’s leg be broken off by defign at the fourth or fifth articulation,
                    what is thus broken off always comes again ; but it is not ſo if the fracture be
                    made in the fiiſt, ſecond, or third articulation. In thoſe cafes, the
                    reproduction is very rare if things continue as they are. But what is
                    exceedingly ſurpriſing is, that they do not ; for, upon vifiting the lobſter
                    maimed in theſe barren and unhappy articulations, at the end of two or three
                    days, all the other articulations are found broken off to the fourth ; and it is
                    ſuſpected they have performed the operation on themſelves, to make the
                    réproduction of a leg certain.</p>
                <p>The part reproduced is not only perfectly like that retrenched, but alſo, in a
                    certain fpace of time, grows equal to it. Hence it is that we frequently ſee
                    lobſters, which have their two big legs unequal, and that in all proportions.
                    This ſhows the ſmaller leg to be a new one.</p>
                <p>A part thus reproduced being broken, there is a ſe-cond reproduction. The
                    ſummer, which is the only fεafon of the year when the lobſters eat, is the moſt
                    favourable time for the reproduction. It is then performed in four or five
                    weeks; whereas it takes up eight or nine months in any other ſeaſon. The ſmall
                    legs are ſometimes reproduced, but more rarely, as well as more ſlowly, than the
                    great ones : the horns do the ſame. The experiment is moſt eafily tried on the
                    common crab. See Metaphysics, p.574. note (f) ; and Physiology, n <hi rend="sup"
