He found&nbsp;that the section and swell at I, corresponding to an arc of&nbsp;a circle, gave a discharge nearly one fourth too great (they&nbsp;were as 405216 to 492142). Therefore the curve is sucn&nbsp;that AD is greater than DF, and that it is more incurvated&nbsp;at F than at A. He found, that making DA to DF as 10&nbsp;to 9, and the curve FIA an arc of an ellipse whose longer&nbsp;axis was vertical, would give a very nice correspondence of&nbsp;the sections, velocities, and slopes. The whole extcnt of&nbsp;the swell, therefore, can never be double of AD, and must&nbsp;always greatly surpass AD ; and these limits will do very&nbsp;well for every practical question. Therefore, making DF&nbsp;nine tenths of AD, and drawing the chord AD, and making DI one half of D </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">i,</span><span class="font2"> we shall be very near the truth.&nbsp;Then we get the swell with sufficient precision for any point&nbsp;H between F and D, by making I'D<sup>2</sup> : FH<sup>!</sup> = ID : ΗΛ;&nbsp;and if H is between D and A, we get its distance from the&nbsp;tangent DA by a similar process.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">It only remains to determine the swell produced in the waters of a river by the erection of a bridge or cleaning&nbsp;sluice, which contracts the passage. This requires the solution of</span></p>

Given the depth, breadth, and slope of a river, to determine the swell occasioned by the piers of a bridge or&nbsp;sides of a cleaning sluice, which contract the passage by a&nbsp;given quantity, for a given length of channel.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">This swell depends on two circumstances.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole river must pass through a narrow space,&nbsp;with a velocity proportionably increased ; and this requires&nbsp;a certain head of water above the bridge.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The water, in passing the length of the piers with a&nbsp;velocity greater than that corresponding to the primary&nbsp;slope of the river, will require a greater slope in order to&nbsp;acquire this velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Let V be the velocity of the river before the erection of the bridge, and K the quotient of the width of the river divided by the sum of the widths between the piers. If the&nbsp;length of the piers, or their dimension in the direction of&nbsp;the stream, is not very great, KV will nearly express the&nbsp;velocity of the river under the arches ; and if we suppose&nbsp;for a moment the contraction (in the sense hitherto used)&nbsp;to be nothing, the height producing this velocity will be&nbsp;K<sup>s</sup>V<sup>2</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">——. But the river will not rise so high, having already</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">a slope and velocity before getting under the arches, and V<sup>s</sup></span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the height corresponding to this velocity is — ; thcrefore</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">the height for producing the augmentation of velocity is ]ζ2y2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;y </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">2</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">---. But if we make allowance for contraction, we</span></p>
<p><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">'2g &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;%g</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">must employ a co-efficient 2G less than </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">2g,</span><span class="font2"> and we must multiply the height now found by &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It will then become</span></p>

<p><span class="font2">the swell which must produce the augmentation of velocity.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">With respect to what is necessary for producing the additional slope between the piers, let </span><span class="font2" style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span class="font2"> be the natural slope of the river (or rather the difference of level in the length&nbsp;of the piers) before the erection of the bridge, and corresponding to the velocity V ; K¾j will very nearly express&nbsp;the difference of superficial level for the length of the&nbsp;piers, which is necessary for maintaining the velocity KV&nbsp;through the same length.

<p><span class="font2">These are the chief questions or problems on this subject whicn occur in the practice of an engineer ; and the solutions which we have given may in every case be depended on as very near the truth, and we are confident&nbsp;that the errors will never amount to one fifth of the whole&nbsp;quantity. We are equally certain, that of those who call&nbsp;themselves engineers, and who, without hesitation, undertake jobs of enormous expense, not one in ten is able even&nbsp;to guess at the result of such operations, unless the circumstances of the case happen to coincide with those of some&nbsp;other project which he has executed, or has distinctly examined ; and very few have the sagacity and penetration&nbsp;necessary for appreciating the effects of the distinguishing&nbsp;circumstances which yet remain. The society established&nbsp;for the encouragement of arts and manufactures could&nbsp;scarcely do a more important service to the public in the line&nbsp;of their institution, than by publishing in their transactions&nbsp;a description of every work of tllis kind executed in the&nbsp;kingdom, with an account of its performance. This would&nbsp;be a most valuable collection of experiments and facts.&nbsp;The unlearned practitioner would find among them something which resembles in its chief circumstances almost any&nbsp;project which could occur to him in his business, and would&nbsp;tell him what to expect in the case under his management ;&nbsp;and the intelligent engineer, assisted by mathematical knowledge, and the habit of classing things together, would frequently be able to frame general rules. To a gentleman&nbsp;qualified as was the Chevalier du Buat, such a collection&nbsp;would be inestimable, and might suggest a theory as far&nbsp;excelling his as he has excelled all other writers.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">We shall conclude this article with some observations on the methods which may be taken for rendering small rivers&nbsp;and brooks fit for inland navigation, or at least for floatage.&nbsp;We get much instruction on this subject from what has&nbsp;been said concerning the swell produced in a river by&nbsp;weirs, bars, or any diminution of its former section. Our&nbsp;knowledge of the form which the surface of this swell affects&nbsp;will furnish rules for spacing these obstructions in such a&nbsp;manner, and at such distances from each other, that the&nbsp;swell produced by one shall extend to the one above it.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">If we know the slope, the breadth, and the depth of a river, in the droughts of summer, and have determined on&nbsp;the height of the floodgates, or keeps, which are to be set&nbsp;up in its bed, it is evident that their stations are not matters of arbitrary choice, if we would derive the greatest possible advantage from them.</span></p>
<p><span class="font2">Some rivers in Flanders and Italy are made navigable in some sort by simple sluices, which, being shut, form magazines of water, which, being discharged by opening the&nbsp;gates, raises the inferior reach enough to permit the passage of the craft which are kept on it. After this momentary rise the keeps are shut again, the water sinks in the&nbsp;lower reach, and the lighters which were floated through&nbsp;the shallows are now obliged to draw into those parts of the&nbsp;reach where they can lie afloat till the next supply of water&nbsp;from above enables them to proceed. This is a very rude&nbsp;and imperfect method, and unjustifiable at this day, when&nbsp;we know the effect of locks, or at least of double gates.&nbsp;We do not mean to enter on the consideration of these contrivances, and to give the methods of their construction,&nbsp;in this place, but refer our readers to what has been already&nbsp;said on this subject in the article Navigation Inland, and&nbsp;to what will be said in the article Water-Works. At&nbsp;present we confine ourselves to the single point of husbanding the difterent falls in the bed of the river, in such a manner that there may be everywhere a sufficient depth of water ;&nbsp;and, in what we have to deliver on the subject, we shall&nbsp;take the form of an example to illustrate the application 01&nbsp;the foregoing rules.</span></p>
