<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Twine Manufacture.—</span><span class="font0">The making of twines and small cords forms a distinct branch of the rope trade, the whole of the operations being carried out on a series of machines in which a large&nbsp;number of twines and cords are twisted and otherwise prepared&nbsp;simultaneously, while in rope-making the machines deal only in&nbsp;general with the material of one rope at a time. Common twines&nbsp;are twisted from prepared yarns on a twine-twisting frame, the&nbsp;same in principle as the doubling spindle frames of the ordinary&nbsp;textile trade. The bobbins of yarn are placed on pegs in the&nbsp;creel above the twisting spindles, from two to five bobbins being&nbsp;placed over each spindle according to the number of yarns&nbsp;which go to make up the twine. These yarns are passed round a&nbsp;pair of rollers, which pull them off the bobbins and deliver them&nbsp;evenly and with regularity to the flyer of the spindle, by which&nbsp;they are twisted and wound on the bobbin round which they rotate.&nbsp;By a recent improvement the required number of yarns, instead of&nbsp;being drawn from separate bobbins, are first wound together upon&nbsp;one bobbin in a “ doubling winding frame.” Aseries of bobbins&nbsp;so filled are placed on spindles in a twisting frame and twisted&nbsp;by inverted flyers ; the twisted twine is drawn off by pairs of conical&nbsp;grooved twist rollers round which it passes, and is wound on taking-up bobbins. Cord or cable laid twine—that is, twine twisted first&nbsp;as above and then in strands of three, cabled or twisted in the&nbsp;reverse direction—is prepared on cabling machines. At the back of&nbsp;the machine the yarns receive their first twist as above described,&nbsp;and thence the strands from three spindles are drawn off together&nbsp;over a pair of~cone rollers, by which they are laid, and thence they&nbsp;pass to the front of the machine, where there is a range of powerful&nbsp;flyers and spindles by which they are twisted and wound upon a&nbsp;large bobbin. Twines and cords at this stage are rough and bristly&nbsp;in appearance, and for finishing them they undergo a dressing,&nbsp;sizing, and polishing operation in a special polishing machine.&nbsp;From the bobbins they are unwound and passed through a trough&nbsp;of hot water, thence in parallel order over the surface of a set of&nbsp;rubbing rollers covered with strong card cloth revolving at high&nbsp;speed in a contrary direction to that in which the twine is travelling. The friction of the strong card wires shaves and smooths&nbsp;the twine, which then passes through the sizing trough containing a hot paste, usually of potato farina. The superfluous paste is&nbsp;squeezed out by passing the twine between rollers, and it is next&nbsp;passed over rollers covered with rough coir, which presses in all fibres&nbsp;yet protruding from the twine, and finally it is dried by passing&nbsp;round a range of steam-heated cylinders, running parallel with&nbsp;which are coir-covered polishing rollers which smooth the twine&nbsp;while it is being dried. The finished twine is wound into balls of&nbsp;a definite weight on a balling machine.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Rope-Spinning.—</span><span class="font0">The machines required for making ropes from spun yarn consist of a forming flyer for forming the strands and&nbsp;a laying machine for twisting the strands into rope. A cabling&nbsp;machine for uniting three-strand hawsers into a cable is only a&nbsp;second’laying machine of larger and heavier dimensions ; but it is&nbsp;still a common practice to lay the heavy cable on the ropewalk.&nbsp;The two operations of forming strands and laying rope may be performed on one combined machine, especially in dealing with light&nbsp;ropes composed of a few yarns ; but as a rule separate machines&nbsp;are preferred for each operation. In a simple machine designed&nbsp;only for a single twisting operation there must be one fixed and&nbsp;one revolving section. If the section which contains the bobbins&nbsp;of yarn to be twisted is fixed, then the section in which is placed&nbsp;the bobbin for receiving the twisted product must be made to&nbsp;revolve. A machine in which the two operations of forming&nbsp;strands and laying rope are combined is of necessity cumbrous in&nbsp;proportion and complex in gearing. It must embrace three forming flyers, to form simultaneously three strands which in another&nbsp;part of the machine are laid into one rope. The forming flyers revolve in one direction to twist the strands, while they move in the&nbsp;opposite direction as a whole with the revolution of the laying&nbsp;section which gives the finishing twist to the rope, and such complex inter-revolutions within one frame are somewhat unwieldy.&nbsp;Finally, the machines may be made with their axis of revolution&nbsp;either vertical or horizontal. With all these alternatives there is&nbsp;considerable room for modification in the twisting arrangements.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">The ordinary form of strand-laying machine is a vertical flyer (fig. 3). It Consistsof two or more upright frames or creels </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">a, a,</span><span class="font0"> capable&nbsp;of holding ranged above each other a&nbsp;certain number of bobbins, from which&nbsp;the yarn may be easily run off and carried&nbsp;upward to be formed into a strand. The&nbsp;creels are fixed above and below in a stout&nbsp;circular plate and framework </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">bb,</span><span class="font0"> to which&nbsp;motion of rotation is given by gearing c,&nbsp;placed on the under side. At the upper&nbsp;end of the revolving framework the yarns&nbsp;from the various bobbins are passed&nbsp;through a register plate </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d,</span><span class="font0"> a circular&nbsp;piece of metal pierced with concentric&nbsp;holes corresponding in number with the&nbsp;bobbins which the creels are fitted to&nbsp;hold. Beyond the register plate </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">d</span><span class="font0"> the&nbsp;yarns come together in the trumpetshaped mouth of the stranding tube.&nbsp;The stranding tube itself varies in gauge&nbsp;according to the diameter of the strand&nbsp;being made, and in it the yarns are&nbsp;caught, rounded, compressed, twisted, and</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">smoothed, and, passing out, the new-formed strand is drawn over a pulley </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span class="font0"> around “ drawing-off” gearfi, and wound on a large bobbin&nbsp;or drum </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">g.</span><span class="font0"> The speed at which the drawing-off gear revolves regulates the hardness or softness of twist given to the strand, and its&nbsp;rotation can be varied at pleasure by the use of change wheels.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In fig. 4 is illustrated a different form of stranding machine, of American origin. In this apparatus the bobbin creel is stationary</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">and the yarns are drawn through the register plate and twisted in the stranding tube by the revolution of the entire framework in&nbsp;which are placed the drawing-off gear and the large drum or spool&nbsp;on which the finished strand is wound. The advantages claimed&nbsp;for this apparatus are facility of replacing bobbins as the yarns&nbsp;run out, and increased production owing to the rapid and uninterrupted rotation of the flyer.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In the ordinary laying machine there are only three bobbins of strand to deal with ; but, from the fact that it is necessary to give&nbsp;a certain amount of “forehard” or twisting to the strands themselves while they are being twisted together in an opposite direction&nbsp;for laying, the machine is not without complexity. The three&nbsp;bobbins revolve together within a strong iron frame, and that&nbsp;motion forms the strand into a rope. But each bobbin is at&nbsp;the same time revolving in a contrary direction on its own axis&nbsp;at the rate tempered to the amount of forehard it is desired to&nbsp;put on the rope in laying. Moreover, in order to deliver evenly&nbsp;and in equal quantities the heavy and intractable strands from&nbsp;each bobbin to the laying top, it is necessary to have within each&nbsp;bobbin frame a drawing-off motion, and thus we have three dis</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
