<p><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">one than </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">the other.” Indeed </span><span class="font2">M. </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Vosmaer points out in his </span><span class="font2">I </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">life </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Rembrandt that there is a marked parallelism between I&nbsp;Rembrandt’s painted and etched work, his early work in both cases !&nbsp;being timid and tentative, while he gradually gains strength and '&nbsp;character both with the brush and the graver’s tools. M. ׳&nbsp;Yosmaer’s scheme </span><span class="font2">of </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">chronological order has doubtless been !&nbsp;challenged in some respects, but it gave the deathblow to the older&nbsp;system. Mr Seymour Haden has started the theory that many of&nbsp;the etchings ascribed to Rembrandt up to 1640 were the work of his&nbsp;pupils, and seems to make out his case, though it may be carried&nbsp;too far. He argues (in his monograph on the </span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Etched Work of&nbsp;Rembrandt,</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;"> 1877) that Rembrandt’s real work in etching began |&nbsp;after Saskia’s death, when he assumes that Rembrandt betook himself to Elsbroek, the country house of his “powerful friend” Jan </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">j&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">Six. But it must be remembered that the future burgomaster was&nbsp;then but a young student of twenty-four, a member of a great&nbsp;family it is true, but unmarried and taking as yet no share in !&nbsp;public life. That Rembrandt was a frequent visitor at Elsbroek,&nbsp;and that the Three Trees and other etchings may have been pro- </span><span class="font4" style="font-weight:bold;">j&nbsp;</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;">duced there, may be admitted without requiring us to believe that :&nbsp;he had left Amsterdam as his place of abode. The great period of&nbsp;his etching lies between 1639 and 1661, after which the old painter !&nbsp;seems to have renounced the needle. In these twenty years were&nbsp;produced his greatest works in portraiture, landscape, and Bible&nbsp;story. They bear the impress of the genius of the man.</span></p>

<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">REMIGIUS (or </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Remedius, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">as the name is spelt in Fredegarius and elseAA-fiere), or </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">Remi, </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Avas born of noble&nbsp;parents and, according to a later tradition, in the district&nbsp;of Laon. In one of his OAvn letters, Avritten apparently&nbsp;about 512 </span><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;font-variant:small-caps;">a.d., </span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Remigius speaks of himself as having&nbsp;been a bishop for fifty-three years. This throws back his&nbsp;election to about 459 ; and, as all his earlier biographers&nbsp;agree in making him twenty-one years of age on his&nbsp;appointment to this office, the date of his birth may be&nbsp;fixed at somewhere about the year 438. The bishopric was forced upon the young recluse by the townspeople&nbsp;of Rheims, who in this century had not yet lost the right&nbsp;of electing their own pastor. For the next thirty-seven&nbsp;years of Remigius’s life A\־e have no clue excepting one, or&nbsp;at most two, allusions in the letters of Sidonius Apollin-aris </span><span class="font3" style="font-style:italic;">(Ep.</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"> viii. 14 ; ix. 7,8),—both of which epistles M.&nbsp;Baret has assigned to from 472 to 474. It is true that&nbsp;Fredegarius (Du Cliesne, i. 728), Avriting about 658, and&nbsp;the later biographers associate the name of Remigius Avith&nbsp;that of Clovis in the story of the famous vase of Sois-sons. But the earlier account of Gregory (</span><span class="font2" style="font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">c</span><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">. 590) lends&nbsp;no sanction to this association ; and it is not till 496&nbsp;that Remigius figures definitely in history. On the&nbsp;Christmas day of this year he baptized Clovis at Rheims&nbsp;Avith the greatest pomp. “ Bow thy head meekly, O&nbsp;Sicambrian,” Avere his Avords to the royal convert ; “ adore&nbsp;Avhat thou hast burnt and burn Avhat thou hast adored.”&nbsp;Two of the king’s sisters Avere baptized about the same&nbsp;time ; and on the death of one of these, Albofledis, Remigius Avrote Clovis a letter of consolation that is still preserved (Dom. Bouq. iv. 51). The traditions and perhaps&nbsp;the documents of Hincmar’s time enumerated the immense&nbsp;possessions conferred by Clovis upon his favourite ])relate. Remigius, in his turn, does not seem to have been&nbsp;slack in urging the orthodox king to undertake the&nbsp;deliverance of his fellow believers who in southern Gaul&nbsp;reluctantly submitted to the yoke of the Aryan Burgundians and Visigoths. His intrigues with the discontented&nbsp;bishops of Burgundy are said to have paved the Avay for&nbsp;Clovis’s invasion (500). Hincmar has preserved the&nbsp;tradition that Remigius blessed Clovis before he set out</span></p><div>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;"><sup>1</sup> on his Avar against the Visigoths (507) ; r.nd Ave still ha\<sup>r</sup>e the letter in which he recommends the king to be merciful&nbsp;in his neAv conquests (Bouquet, iv. 52 ; see, however,</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">' Junghans’s remarks on the probable date of this letter).</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">It is not, hoAvever, solely as a statesman or as the mentor of a barbarian king that Remigius claims attention. In Hincmar’s time he Avas recognized as the second&nbsp;founder of the church of Rheims, to whose influence that&nbsp;see OAved the greater ])art of its possessions ; and in&nbsp;such a matter the popular tradition can hardly have been&nbsp;entirely Avrong. One of his feAv remaining letters is&nbsp;directed in the most vigorous terms against the encroachments of a neighbouring bishop, Falco of Maestriclit&nbsp;(Bouq., iv. 53). He is said to have established a bishopric&nbsp;at Laon, his native place. So great Avas his fame that it&nbsp;reached the ears of Alaric and his Gothic counsellors at&nbsp;Toulouse, and that, at last, Pope Hormisdas or one of&nbsp;his immediate predecessors appointed him his vicar&nbsp;throughout the Frankish domains. Of Remigius’s writ-ings only a feAv verses and the letters alluded to above&nbsp;have been preserved ; but his credit for learning and&nbsp;eloquence is amply attested by Sidonius Apollinaris and&nbsp;Gregory of Tours. The former, writing to Remigius&nbsp;(c. 472), declares him to be unsurpassed by any living&nbsp;orator.</span></p>
<p><span class="font3" style="font-weight:bold;">Gregory has also preserved the tradition that Remigius Avas bishop of Rheims for more than seventy years (De&nbsp;Gloria Conf., 89), a fact Avhicli inclines us to lay some&nbsp;confidence on the more detailed statement of Hincmar&nbsp;that he died on January 13, in the ninety-sixth year of his&nbsp;age, after an episcopate of seventy-four years. Hence&nbsp;Ave may fix upon 533 as the date of his decease, more&nbsp;especially as this conclusion coincides Avell enough Avith the&nbsp;little that is known as to the chronology of his îavo immediate successors (Ste Marthe, ix. 10-13). In 882, Avhen&nbsp;the Northmen AA־ere threatening a descent upon the un-AA<sup>r</sup>allecl city of Rheims, Hincmar had the body of St Remi&nbsp;' removed from its first resting-place in the little church of&nbsp;! St Christopher to Epernay. Next year it aa־us brought back&nbsp;to Rheims, but it Avas not restored to its original home&nbsp;till some years later. We learn from Gregory of Tours&nbsp;that, even so early as the reign of Childebert II. (575-596)&nbsp;the first of October AA<sup>7</sup>as held sacred to the memory of&nbsp;the saint. During the Carlovingian times this day became&nbsp;<sup>;</sup> one of the great feasts of the year, its observance being&nbsp;<sup>:</sup> sanctioned by the council of Mainz in 813 and a capitulary&nbsp;of Louis le Débonnaire in 821 (Dessailly). In 1049 Pope&nbsp;Leo IX. assisted at the removal of the relics and issued a&nbsp;decree for the observation of the fête.</span></p>
<p><span class="font1" style="font-weight:bold;">The authorities for the life of St Remi are very meagre. An almost contemporary Vita Rcmigii, written in the popular&nbsp;j Latin of the period (cothurno Gallicano), and known to Gregory of&nbsp;Tours, Avas, according to Hincmar, almost entirely destroyed in the&nbsp;I troubled times of Charles Martel, but not before it had been&nbsp;! abbreviated and stripped of nearly all historic value by Fortunatus&nbsp;j between the years 565 and 590. This abridgment, which still&nbsp;exists, formed the basis of the Vita Rcmigii Avritten by Hincmar,&nbsp;archbishop of Rheims from 845 to 882, who, however, professes to&nbsp;incorporate with his work some fragments of the original Vita&nbsp;and other ancient documents, as he has most certainly incorporated&nbsp;the living traditions of his own age. In the course of the next&nbsp;century Flodoard, a canon of Rheims {oh. 966), compiled his account&nbsp;of St Remi, by making a very free use of his predecessors’ labours,&nbsp;with, however, some traditional information of his own. The above&nbsp;works are all in Mignc’s Patrologia, vols, lxxxviii., exxv., kc.&nbsp;See also Fredegarius and Gregory of Tours, whose authority is&nbsp;only second to that of Fortunatus. The scattered documents of&nbsp;the Merovingian period are to be found in the great collections&nbsp;of A. I)u Cliesne, Bouquet, and Labbé. Le Cointe’s Annales&nbsp;Ecclesiastici, vol. i. ; Mabillon’s Annales Ordinis Bened., vol. i. ;&nbsp;Ste Marthe’s Gallia Christiana, \<sup>T</sup>ol. ix. ; and the Ada Sanctorum&nbsp;(October 1), which contains the best modern life of St Remi, may&nbsp;be consulted with advantage. Of French lives see that by the&nbsp;prior Armand. The so-called Testamenlum Rcmigii, which has&nbsp;been preserved in a longer and shorter form by Flodoard and</span></p></div><br clear="all"/><div></div><br clear="all"/>
