        <p><span class="font0">RUTH, BOOK OF, in the Old Testament. The story of Ruth (the
                Moabitess, great-grandmother of David) is one of the&nbsp;Old Testament Hagiographa
                and is usually reckoned as the&nbsp;second of the five </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">Megillolh</span><span class="font0"> (Festal Rolls). This
                position&nbsp;corresponds to the Jewish practice of reading the book at
                the&nbsp;feast of Pentecost; Spanish MSS., however, place it at the&nbsp;head of the
                </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Megillolh',</span><span
                class="font0"> and the Talmud </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >{Baba Bathra,</span><span class="font0"> 14Ô)&nbsp;gives it the first place among
                all the Hagiographa. On the&nbsp;other hand, it follows Judges in the Septuagint,
                the Vulgate&nbsp;and the English version. But although it was very natural&nbsp;that
                a later rearrangement should transfer Ruth from the&nbsp;Hagiographa to the
                historical books, and place it between&nbsp;Judges and Samuel, no motive can be
                suggested for thé opposite&nbsp;change, and the presumption is that it found a place
                in the&nbsp;last part of the Jewish canon after the second (with the historical
                books) had been definitely closed. See Bible: </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">Old&nbsp;Testament,</span><span class="font0"> section I.
                “ Canon Canticles; Lamentations.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">* That the book of Ruth did not originally form part of the series of
                “Former Prophets” (Joshua-Kings) is further probable&nbsp;from the fact that it is
                quite untouched by the process of&nbsp;“ prophetic ” or “ Deuteronomistic ” editing,
                which helped to&nbsp;give that series its present shape after the fall of the
                kingdom&nbsp;of Judah. The narrative has no affinity with the point of&nbsp;view
                which looks on the history of Israel as a series of examples&nbsp;of divine justice
                and mercy in the successive rebellions and&nbsp;repentances of the people of
                    God.@@<sup>1</sup> But if the book had been&nbsp;known at the time when the
                history from Joshua to Kings&nbsp;was edited it could hardly have been excluded from
                the collection; the ancestry of David (iv. 17, 18-22) was of greater
                interest&nbsp;than that of Saul, which is given in 1 Sam. ix. 1, whereas the
                old&nbsp;history names no ancestor of David beyond his father Jesse.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">In truth the book of Ruth presents itself as dealing with times far
                back (Ruth i. 1), and takes delight in depicting&nbsp;details of antique life and
                obsolete usages (iv. 7); it&nbsp;views the stormy period before the institution of
                the&nbsp;kingship through the softening atmosphere of time, which&nbsp;imparts to
                the scene a gentle sweetness very different from&nbsp;the harsher colours of the old
                narratives of the book of Judges.&nbsp;It has indeed been argued that, as the author
                seems to take&nbsp;no offence at the marriage of Israelites with Moabite
                women,&nbsp;he must have lived before the time of Ezra and Nehemiah&nbsp;(Ezra ix.;
                Neh. xiii.); but the same argument would prove&nbsp;that the book of Esther was
                written before Ezra. The very&nbsp;designation of a period of Hebrew history as “
                the days of the&nbsp;judges ” is based on the Deuteronomistic additions to the
                book&nbsp;of Judges (ii. 16 sqq.) and does not occur till the period of
                the&nbsp;exile. It is true that the language has some features which&nbsp;appear to
                link it with the narratives in Samuel and Kings, but&nbsp;it might fairly be assumed
                either that the book is the work of a&nbsp;late author well acquainted with the
                earlier literature, or that&nbsp;an old narrative had undergone some rewriting at a
                later age.&nbsp;No definite conclusion can be. drawn from the fact that
                the&nbsp;language stands in marked contrast to that of Chronicles,
                Ezra,&nbsp;Nehemiah, &amp;c., since writings presumably more or less contemporary
                did not necessarily share the same characteristics</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">(observe, for example, the prose parts of Job).</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Like the stories appended to Judges (by a post-Deuteronomic hand) the
                book of Ruth connects itself with Bethlehem, the&nbsp;traditional birthplace of
                David. Some connexion&nbsp;between Bethlehem and Moab has been found in&nbsp;the
                (now corrupt) text of r Chron. iv. 22 (where the Targum&nbsp;and late rabbinical
                exegesis discover references to the story&nbsp;of Ruth), and is more explicitly
                suggested by the isolated&nbsp;1 Sam. xxii. 3 seq. which evidently knew of some
                relationship&nbsp;between Moab and the illustrious descendant of Boaz and&nbsp;Ruth.
                Next, the writer claims the sympathy of his readers</span></p>

        <p><span class="font0">for Ruth, upon whose Moabite origin he frequently insists, and this
                feature is noteworthy in view of the aversion&nbsp;with which intermarriage was
                regarded at a certain period&nbsp;(Deut. xxiii. 3; Neh. xiii.; Ezra ix. seq.). The
                independent&nbsp;evidence for the present post-exilic form of the book
                has&nbsp;consequently led many scholars to the conclusion that it was&nbsp;directed
                against the drastic steps associated with the reforms&nbsp;of Ezra and Nehemiah,
                which, as is known, were not everywhere acceptable. Thus, not only do we have a
                beautiful&nbsp;portrait of a woman of Moabite origin, but she becomes
                the&nbsp;ancestress of David himself, and in the days of these measures&nbsp;the
                charming and simple story would inevitably suggest the&nbsp;question whether the •
                exclusiveness of Judaism could not be&nbsp;carried too far. There is no reason,
                however, to believe that&nbsp;this was the original object of the story. It contains
                other&nbsp;features of considerable interest to which more importance&nbsp;seems to
                be attached, and the writer is evidently an artist&nbsp;who takes manifest delight
                in the touching and graceful details&nbsp;of his picture, and is not simply guided
                by a desire to impart&nbsp;historical information or to enforce some particular
                lesson.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">One docs not look for absolute consistency in oriental narratives,
                and even this little book contains several internal&nbsp;intricacies which demand
                investigation. The genealogy&nbsp;from Perez to David in iv. 18-22 is of little
                value&nbsp;since Salma (Salmon), father of Boaz, is a Calebite clan-name, not
                associated with its earlier seat S. of Hebron as in&nbsp;Judges i., r Sam. xxv.,
                &amp;c., but as “ father ” of Bethlehem,&nbsp;representing exilic or later
                conditions (1 Chron. ii. 51; see Caleb).&nbsp;Apart from other signs of a late date
                in this list of the ancestors&nbsp;and descendants of Boaz, iv. 12 certainly implies
                that the&nbsp;genealogical lines of Perez and Boaz were not identical, and&nbsp;thus
                verses 18-22 in the opinion of most scholars are a later&nbsp;addition.</span></p>
        <p><span class="font0">Further, the story involves points of old family usage which are no
                longer clear. The well-known custom which gives the&nbsp;nearest heir of the dead a
                right to inherit the widow is naturally&nbsp;distinct from the levirate </span><span
                class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">(q.v.),</span><span class="font0"> where it
                is the brother’s duty&nbsp;to marry his widowed sister-in-law if childless, and
                where the&nbsp;eldest son succeeds to the name and inheritance of the
                deceased.&nbsp;In Hebrew usage the refusal to perform the levirate
                brought&nbsp;ignominy (see Deut. xxv. 5-10), and Gen. xxxviii. relates
                how&nbsp;Tamar, when Shelah was not given to her, obtained a child&nbsp;through her
                father-in-law Judah (see esp. vers. 14, 26).@@<sup>2</sup> In&nbsp;addition to these
                customs to prevent the alienation of the&nbsp;estate and to perpetuate the family
                name, the post-exilic story&nbsp;in Num. xxvii. 1-11, xxxvi. gives daughters the •
                right of&nbsp;inheritance provided they do not marry outside the
                tribe.&nbsp;Although the levirate still continued (Matt. xxii. 24 sqq.),
                the&nbsp;late laws in Lev. xviii. 16, xx. 21, as also this story, may be&nbsp;aimed
                against it. Finally, the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;"
                >goel</span><span class="font0"> (“ next kinsman,” lit.&nbsp;“ avenger ”; see

                (Jer. xxxii. 6-15), and indeed&nbsp;must redeem the property which his needy
                relative might be&nbsp;compelled to sell (Lev. xxv., see ver. 25). Now it appears
                that&nbsp;Boaz combines the essential duty of the </span><span class="font0"
                style="font-style:italic;">goel</span><span class="font0"> in purchasing
                the&nbsp;estate over which Naomi holds rights, and at the same time&nbsp;marries,
                not Naomi, who is now old, but her daughter-in-law&nbsp;Ruth, in order to perpetuate
                her husband’s family. Naomi,&nbsp;who had realized the impossibility of the levirate
                in her case&nbsp;(i. 11 seq.), returned home a disconsolate and childless
                widow&nbsp;(i. 20 seq.), but the filial Ruth fell in with her plans and
                put&nbsp;herself entirely into the hands of the kinsman Boaz (iii.). In&nbsp;the
                happy finale, Naomi is the recipient of congratulations&nbsp;upon the birth of a son
                to the faithful Ruth (iv. 170, “there&nbsp;is a son born to Naomi ”); the name of
                the dead is thus&nbsp;“raised up” (iv. 10), and the child Obed is clearly
                recognized</span></p>
