<p><span class="font0">and no sisters, that his father had a country property called La Devinière, and was either an apothecary or a&nbsp;tavern-keeper. Half a century after his death De Thou&nbsp;mentions that the house in which he was born had become&nbsp;a tavern. It still stands at the corner of a street called&nbsp;the Rue de la Lamproie, and the tradition may be correct.&nbsp;An indistinct allusion of his own has been taken to mean&nbsp;that he was tonsured in childhood at seven or nine years&nbsp;old; and tradition says that he was sent to the convent of&nbsp;Seuilly, though of course he could then have taken no&nbsp;definite vows, and there is no evidence whatever that the&nbsp;passage in question, which simply condemns the practice&nbsp;referred to, has any personal reference. From Seuilly at&nbsp;an unknown date tradition takes him either to the university of Angers or to the convent school of La Baumette&nbsp;or La Basmette, founded by good King René in the&nbsp;neighbourhood of the Angevin capital. Here he is supposed to have been at school with the brothers Du Bellay,&nbsp;with Geoffroy d’Estissac and others. The next stage in&nbsp;this (as far as evidence goes, purely imaginary) career is&nbsp;the monastery of Fontenay le Comte, where, as has been&nbsp;seen, he is certainly found in 1519 holding a position&nbsp;sufficiently senior to sign deeds for the community, where&nbsp;he, as will be seen, certainly, though at an unknown date,&nbsp;took priest’s orders, and where he also pursued, again certainly, the study of letters, and especially of Greek, with&nbsp;ardour. From this date, therefore, he becomes historically&nbsp;visible. The next certain intelligence which we have of&nbsp;Rabelais is somewhat more directly biographical than this&nbsp;bare entry of his name. The letters of the well-known&nbsp;Greek scholar Budæus, two of which are addressed to&nbsp;Rabelais himself and several more to his friend and fellow-monk Pierre Amy, together with some notices by André&nbsp;Tiraqueau, a learned jurist, to whom Rabelais rather than&nbsp;his own learning has secured immortality, show beyond&nbsp;doubt what manner of life the future author of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">led in his convent. These letters are partly written in&nbsp;Greek and partly in Latin. In Tiraqueau’s book </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">De Legibus&nbsp;Connubialibus,</span><span class="font0"> which excited a controversy with another&nbsp;jurist of the west, Bouchard, also a friend of Rabelais,&nbsp;the latter is described as “a man most learned in both&nbsp;languages and all kinds of scholarship above his age, and&nbsp;beyond the wont and, if I may say so, the excessive&nbsp;scrupulousness of his order.” The excessive scrupulousness&nbsp;of the order showed itself before long in reference to Amy&nbsp;and Rabelais, the latter of whom had, as this sentence of&nbsp;Tiraqueau’s also informs us, translated the first book of&nbsp;Herodotus. The letters of Budæus show that an attempt&nbsp;was made by the heads of the convent or the order to&nbsp;check the studious ardour of these Franciscans; but it&nbsp;failed, and there is no positive evidence of anything like&nbsp;actual persecution, the phrases in the letters of Budæus&nbsp;being merely the usual exaggerated Ciceronianism of the&nbsp;Renaissance. Some books and papers were seized as suspicious, then given back as innocent ; but Rabelais was in&nbsp;all probability disgusted with the cloister,—indeed his great&nbsp;work shows this beyond doubt. In 1524, the year of the&nbsp;publication of Tiraqueau’s book above cited, his friend&nbsp;Geoffroy d’Estissac procured from Clement VII. an induit,&nbsp;licensing a change of order and of abode for Rabelais.&nbsp;From a Franciscan he became a Benedictine, and from&nbsp;Fontenay he moved to Maillezais, of which Geoffroy&nbsp;d’Estissac was bishop. He seems indeed to have been&nbsp;constantly in the company of the bishop and to have made&nbsp;many new literary acquaintances, notably Jean Bouchet,&nbsp;the poet. To him he wrote an epistle in French verse,&nbsp;still extant, which proves that Rabelais, much more truly&nbsp;than Swift, never could have been a poet. The title of&nbsp;this epistle is, however, noteworthy, inasmuch as the author&nbsp;is described in the original (a collection of Bouchet’s works&nbsp;published in 1545) as a man of great literary knowledge&nbsp;in Greek and Latin, and as a great orator in Greek, Latin,&nbsp;and French. But even this learned and hospitable retreat&nbsp;did not apparently satisfy Rabelais. In or before 1530&nbsp;he left Maillezais, abandoned his Benedictine garb for&nbsp;that of a secular priest, and, as he himself puts it in his&nbsp;subsequent </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Supplicatio pro Apostasia</span><span class="font0"> to Pope Paul III.,&nbsp;“ per seculum diu vagatus fuit.” He is met at Montpellier&nbsp;in the year just mentioned. He entered the faculty of&nbsp;medicine there on the 16th of September and became&nbsp;bachelor on the 1st of November, a remarkably short interval, which shows what was thought of his acquirements.&nbsp;Early in 1531 he lectured publicly on Galen and Hippocrates, while his more serious pursuits seem to have been&nbsp;chequered by acting in a </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">morale comédie,</span><span class="font0"> then a very frequent university amusement. Visits to the îles d’Hières,&nbsp;and the composition of a fish sauce in imitation of the&nbsp;ancient </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">garum,</span><span class="font0"> which he sent to his friend Dolet, are&nbsp;associated, not very certainly, with his stay at Montpellier,&nbsp;which, lasting rather more than a year at first, was renewed&nbsp;at intervals for several years.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">In 1532, however, and probably rather early than late in that year, he had moved from Montpellier to Lyons. Here&nbsp;he plunged into manifold work, literary and professional.&nbsp;He was appointed before the beginning of November physician to the hôtel dieu, with a salary of forty livres per&nbsp;annum. He edited for Sebastian Gryphius, in the single&nbsp;year 1532, the medical </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Epistles</span><span class="font0"> of Giovanni Manardi, the&nbsp;</span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Aphorisms</span><span class="font0"> of Hippocrates, with the </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Ars Parva</span><span class="font0"> of Galen,&nbsp;and an edition of two supposed Latin documents, which,&nbsp;however, happened unluckily to be forgeries. These three&nbsp;works were dedicated in order to his three chief friends&nbsp;of Touraine and Poitou, André Tiraqueau, the bishop of&nbsp;Maillezais, and Bouchard. We also have a Latin letter&nbsp;written on 1st December 1532 to a certain Bernard de&nbsp;Salignac, otherwise unknown.</span></p>
<p><span class="font0">It is certain that at this time Lyons was the centre and to a great extent the headquarters of an unusually&nbsp;enlightened society, and indirectly it is clear that Rabelais&nbsp;became intimate with this society. A manuscript distich,&nbsp;which was found in the Toulouse library, on the death of&nbsp;an infant named Theodule, whose country was Lyons and&nbsp;his father Rabelais, would seem to show that he here&nbsp;entered into other connexions than those of friendship.&nbsp;Absolutely nothing, however, is known about the child&nbsp;and its mother ; it is enough to say that the existence of&nbsp;the former would have been by the manners and morals&nbsp;of the time very easily condoned. But what makes the&nbsp;Lyons sojourn of the greatest real importance is that at&nbsp;this time probably appeared the beginnings of the work&nbsp;which was to make Rabelais immortal. It is necessary to&nbsp;say “ probably,” because the strange uncertainty which&nbsp;rests on so much of his life and writings exists here also.&nbsp;There is no doubt that both Gargantua and Pantagruel&nbsp;were popular names of giants in the Middle Ages, though,&nbsp;curiously enough, no mention of the former in French&nbsp;literature much before Rabelais’s time has been traced.&nbsp;In 1526, however, Charles de Bordigné, in a satiric work&nbsp;of no great merit, entitled </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">La Légende de Pierre Faifeu,</span><span class="font0"> has&nbsp;the name Gargantua with an allusion, and in 1532 (if not&nbsp;earlier) there appeared at Lyons </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Les Grandes et Inestimables&nbsp;Chroniques du Grand et Enorme Géant Gargantua.</span><span class="font0"> This&nbsp;is a short book on the plan of the later burlesques and&nbsp;romances of the Round Table. Arthur and Merlin appear&nbsp;with Grantgosier, as he is here spelt, Galemelle (Gargalelle),&nbsp;Gargantua himself, and the terrible mare. But there is&nbsp;no trace of the action or other characters of </span><span class="font0" style="font-style:italic;">Gargantua&nbsp;</span><span class="font0">that was to be, nor is the manner of the piece in the least&nbsp;worthy of Rabelais. No one supposes that he wrote it,&nbsp;though it has been supposed that he edited it and that in</span></p><div></div><br clear="all"/>
